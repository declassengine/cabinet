Introduction.IN our Second Report on German Oil Supplies^ we intimated thatMr. Geoffrey Lloyd&apos;s Sub-Committee was engaged in a review of the GermanOil Position, which had formed the subject of an earlier report dated the13th October, 1939 a Report which had been the starting point of our owninvestigations. We attach herewith the new Report, to the compilation of whichthe Sub-Committee and the Government Departments concerned have devoted agreat deal of research in the light of six months&apos; experience of actual warfare.2. The results of the enquiry are summarised in a brief covering note bythe Chairman. He points out that, while the German oil position can now beestimated with greater accuracy than was possible last October, there remainmany unpredictable factors both in supply and consumption, and that conclusionscan only be stated in the broadest terms. His conclusions, with which we concurgenerally subject to the following remarks, are set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5of his Note : II. Germany&apos;s Present Position.Paragraph 4. *(i) &quot; Germany&apos;s stocks on the 1st March, 1940, had probably been reduced to about If million tons. We consider that her oil situation as a whole would become critical if stocks were reduced to about1 million tons.&quot;3. The significance of the Sub-Committee&apos;s estimate will be realised fromColumn II of the following table :  Table I.Col. I. Col. 11. Col. in.Germany.       The United Kingdom,(Estimated) (Actual)Tons. Tons.Stocks on 1st September, 1939........       3 million 6,666,000Stocks on 1st March 1940        ........

From Column II it will be seen that by the 1st March the Germans, after sixmonths of static warfare (apart from the Polish campaign and the subsequenttransfer of forces from east to west), had lost 1^ million tons of oil, and wereseparated by only f million tons from danger point.4. Column III, containing the corresponding figures for the UnitedKingdom, was added not so much for purposes of a scientific comparison, for theconditions of the two countries are too different to enable this to be made, but asan interesting commentary on the German position.5. Serious as the position, as stated in the Report, is for Germany, it isnot &quot; critical &quot; as we hoped it might be at the time of the Sub-Committee&apos;s first report. On that occasion both German consumption and German supplies were over-estimated, but the former more than the latter. In the case of consumption,the over-estimate was due to static warfare; in the case of supplies, to an over-estimate of imports from Russia and Roumania, as shown by the followingtable : Table II.German Supplies in First Six Months.Estimate of Estimate of...... October 13, March 15,1939. 1940. Difference.Stocks    .........       3,000,000 3,000,000Domestic production   ...        1.200,000 1,400,000 4-   200,000Russia, Estonia, &amp;c.    ...          250,000 100,000 -   150,000Roumania        .......          800,000 (minimum) 405,000 -   395,000to 1,600,000 (maximum) to 1,195,000Contraband evasion     ...           ... 200,000 +   200,000It is only fair, however, to note that in October last the Sub-Committee couldnot possibly have foreseen either the static warfare, as affecting consumption, orthe Finnish war and the exceptionally prolonged frost on the Danube, as affecting-supply. This shows, however, the uncertainty of estimates such as it was calledupon to make.III. Germany&apos;s Future Position.8. The next three conclusions bring us to the future and can conveniently beconsidered together: &quot; (ii) If the German forces remain more or less inactive for the next sixmonths and a fairly high rate of importation from Roumania and russia is achieved and maintained, Germany should be able to keepher stocks above the danger-point.   By the end of the year her rateof supply might begin to exceed her rate of consumption..  (iii) // Germany starts or is compelled to undertake a high degree of activity in all armed forces in the coming months, it is hard to see how under present conditions she can avert a serious situation before next Winter.(iv) There are, of course, varying degrees of activity between (ii) and (iii)above.  For. example, Germany should be able to conduct an intensive. submarine and air campaign against British shipping and portswithout risk of an early breakdown in respect of oil.&quot;7. While we do not dissent from these conclusions as a whole, we feel boundto warn the War Cabinet against building too much on the effect on German oil supplies of active warfare. One rather unexpected result of the estimates in theReport before us is that the difference between Germany&apos;s total consumption in&quot; active &quot; and &quot; static &quot; warfare is less than might have been expected.   The
point is brought out by the following figures culled from the Tables in para-graph 14 of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report: Table iii. Estimatedconsumption duringfirst twelve months.Static warfare during the first half of the year Tons.and increased activity during the second half    ...       ...       ... 7 170 000Static warfare throughout the year...... 6,&apos;36o!oOODifference............ 810,000The reason for the difference not being greater appears to be the magnitude ofthe estimate for Civil and Industrial consumption, which is assumed to remain a constant, viz., 3,500,000 tons, that is to say, on a rough approximation half thetotal consumption of Germany in either case. The whole of the difference of810,000 tons between &quot; active &quot; and &quot; passive &quot; warfare falls on the Servicesand is divided between them in the Report as follows : Tons.Army ...............      320,000Navy..................      300,000Air Force    .........      ......      190,000810,0008. Although this figure of 810,000 tons is rather less than might have been expected, it is a very considerable factor to be taken into calculation by a nationat war which is estimated at the moment to have only 750,000 tons between her position and the danger-point of 1,000,000 tons. But a relatively small increasein supplies spread over Russia, Roumania, leakage through contraband control,&quot; loot &quot; from conquered neighbours (Holland, Belgium, &amp;c), or even some hiddenreserve or other factor which has been overlooked, would make a great difference in the situation.  That is why we utter this word of caution.9. Moreover, as the Sub-Committee points out in conclusion (iv), there are all kinds of degrees of activity between &quot;active &quot; and &quot; passive &quot; warfare, andthe consumption of oil will vary accordingly. Similarly the rate of importationfrom Russia and Roumania is susceptible of large variations. A series ofinteresting Tables is attached to the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report (pages 21 to 25),in which the situation is examined on six different hypotheses. The results leave to Germany at the end of the first year of war 1,870,000 tons in the most favourable case (Table II) and only 510,000 tons in the least favourable case(Table III).10. All this tends to confirm our caveat against undue optimism, but the tables bring out two important considerations :-(i) That oil supplies must be a very important factor in Germany&apos;s plans,(ii) The immense importance to Germany of Russian and Roumanian oil supplies.IV. Lubricating Oil, Gas Oil and Diesel Oil.11. The importance of Russian and Roumanian supplies is still furtheraccentuated when we come to the Sub-Committee&apos;s fifth conclusion : &quot; (v) Apart from Germany&apos;s oil position as a tvhole her ability to conductwar may be vitally affected by a lack of adequate supplies of certain essential products, such as lubricating oil and diesel oil, both ofwhich seem to be weak points in her oil economy.&quot;[21038] b 2
12. Appendices IV and V of the Sub-Oommittee&apos;s Report are very interesting from this point of view. In Appendix IV, paragraph 6, the positionas to lubricating oil for the first year of the war is summed up as follows : Estimated requirements  Tons.Defence...............     115.000 to 140,000Civil    ...............     500,000615,000 to 640,000Resources (apart from initial stocks) Imports (say)............. 75.000Domestic production ...       ...       ... 200,000275.000The difference between resources and requirements therefore is from340,000 to 365,000 tons. It should, however, be recognised that by reconditioningof old oil and other expedients the Germans are no doubt making every effort tocover their requirements.The initial stocks are unknown, but since the outbreak of war they musthave been heavily drawn on. In 1938 388,000 tons out of total resources of568,000 tons were imported from abroad. Of this import of 388,000 tons no less than 340,000 tons came from the United States and the Dutch West IndiesRussia was the third source of supply with 33,000 tons, but Roumania whichdoes not produce much lubricating oil, only sent 9,000 tons. Russia, therefore,is the most important external available source of supply of lubricating oils inpresent conditions. A remark by the Air Ministry, which is quoted in theSub-Committee&apos;s Appendix IV is worth noting : &quot; viewing Germany&apos;slubricating oil position as a whole we are of opinion that her supplies of high-grade oil for all purposes are a definite limiting factor.&quot;13. Germany&apos;s position as to gas and diesel oils is equally precarious,as shown by the following figures from Appendix V :  Estimated consumption  Tons.Armed forces......       ...      270,000 to   375,000Civil.............       ...   1,100,0001,370,000 to 1,475,000Resources (apart from stocks) Imports      ............. 440,000Domestic production        ...       ... 250,000690,000The gravity of the position is emphasised by the following comment inparagraph 7 of Appendix V : &quot; The figures show that Germany&apos;s position is very difficult in respectof these oils, and that she will be driven at all costs to increase her importsfrom Russia and Roumania, to develop her internal production and to devisefurther economies.&quot;14. Thus in nearly every section of the Sub-Committee&apos;s Report so fardiscussed, we see the vital importance to Germany of Russian and Roumanianoil supplies.V. Concluding Observations.15. As a corollary to the Sub-Committee&apos;s conclusions Mr. Geoffrey Lloydpoints out that Germany&apos;s petroleum difficulties would be increased by any actioncalculated : &quot; (a) to induce Germany to undertake more active operations;(b) -as circumstances permit, to hamper domestic production and prevent its development;
(c) to lead to the destruction of reserves;(d) to restrict further Germany&apos;s oil imports from Roumania and Russia;(e) to prevent Germany obtaining additional supplies by evasion of the contraband control or from the considerable stocks in adjacent neutral countries, more particularly supplies of lubricating and diesel oils,of which German stocks appear to be in short supply.&quot;16. Subject to the caveat we have already entered in paragraphs 7 and 10against counting too much on the effect of the more active operations referred toin (a) we concur in the above comments. We appreciate that they are intended tobe considered as a whole and, as such, we commend them to the War Cabinet.17. The desiderata set forth in (a), (b) and (c) can only be achieved by more active operations, especially in the air, and that raises questions of major strategybeyond the scope of this Report.18. The restriction of German imports from Roumania and Russia,mentioned in (d) however, goes, as we have already indicated, to the heart of thequestion. Up to now, it is true, Germany has not derived much oil from thesesources owing to the hard winter and Russian pre-occupation elsewhere. Butfor the future the outlook is less satisfactory. Partly by threats and partly owing to her ability to supply Roumania with the arms she needs in return foroil, Germany, in spite of our opposition, has succeeded in imposing on Roumaniaan annual oil quota of 1,560,000 tons, or 130,000 tons a month. The first yearbegan on the 1st October, 1939. Forestalment of the monthly quotas is not allowed, but the Germans are permitted to take a carry-over in any month up toa total not exceeding 80,000 tons. The British Minister at Bucharest was recentlyassured, however, that any quantity in excess of 260,000 tons which had not beenlifted would be lost to Germany. It is estimated that as a result of poordeliveries hitherto the Germans have lost the right to 150,000 tons, which would bring the total amount covered by the Agreement, viz.. 1,560.000 tons, down toabout 1,400,000 tons.19. Apart from this relatively favourable agreement, the measures already taken by Germany to improve her communications with Roumania and the black sea and to develop Russia&apos;s resources will soon begin to take effect. They includenew railway tank cars, some of them with double tracks for the German and russian gauges; new tugs, tankers and lighters for the Danube; the developmentof ship communications across the Black Sea; the provision of new oil tanks atRoumanian and even Bulgarian ports; the doubling of the Roumanian railway from the oil fields to Orsova (where new oil tanks are being built), so as to cut outthe vulnerable defile through the Iron Gates of the Danube, besides, no doubt,assistance to Russia, so far as she is willing to accept it. In addition theRoumanian Government is subject to the pressure of repeated missions from theGerman Government, and swarms of Germans including many agents of the gestapo are reported to be present in Roumania, and may well be organised forpurposes of sabotage and terror isation.20. In order to carry out the War Cabinet&apos;s policy of preventingRoumanian and Russian supplies from reaching Germany some modification in previous decisions may be necessary. For example, the War Cabinet&apos;s decisionof the 12th September* last to buy as much Roumanian oil as possible needssome adjustment to a situation in which Roumania has agreed to allow Germany1,560,000 tons of oil a year, and it is hoped by a more elastic purchasing policy to reduce prices below their present exorbitant level. We can still aim atcarrying out the War Cabinet&apos;s decision of the 16th November! last to aim at preventing Germany from obtaining from Roumania more than 1 miTion tonsa year, but in view of the quota agreement it is obvious that our difficulties in achieving our object have increased very considerably.21. Subject to these remarks we shall have to continue mutatis mutandis onthe lines suggested in our last Report (Paper No. W.P. (40) 26, paragraph 23)and, when navigation is resumed, we shall endeavour to slow down Germany&apos;ssupplies by a series of opportunist tactics, in which our representatives in roumania have displayed great ingenuity.   Apart from measures in Roumania* W.M. (39), 13th Conclusions, Minute 13.f W.M. (89), 85th Conclusions, Minute 12.
to obstruct the release to German purchasers of oil from companies friendly tothe Allies, our methods will include the use of the Goeland Company&apos;s fleet tocongest traffic at points on the Danube where navigation is restricted; divertingpilots from German employment, and acts of minor sabotage, which our friends in Poland and on the Danube can be relied on to pursue. The Royal marine operation, when undertaken in the Danubian region, will powerfully reinforcethese methods.22. We must point out, however, that these are all in the nature of minortactics, and, in the long run, if Germany is to be prevented from obtaining large supplies of oil from Roumania and Russia some more ambitious policy must beadopted. That would raise questions of major strategy and policy which wouldtake us beyond the scope of this report.23. We endorse Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd&apos;s final observations as to the importanceof preventing Germany from obtaining supplies by evasion of contraband controller from the considerable stocks in adjacent neutral countries. That is a danger that is always present. There is no reason to believe that any serious leakage is taking place at present, but the situation is being carefully watched by theMinister of Economic Warfare, and, if the emergency does arise, the adoptionof appropriate remedial measures will have to be considered.24. It remains to mention that, in case Germany or Russia should over-run Roumania, arrangements are in hand in conjunction with the roumanian government to complete in their technical aspects the plans for the destructionof the oil fields. The compensation scheme is not yet agreed, but negotiations are in progress. Perhaps the most unsatisfactory feature is the plan for trans-porting expert military personnel from Alexandria to the oil fields to co-operate in the work of destruction. So far the hesitant attitude of the Turks and their refusal to commit themselves in advance have delayed the completion of our plans for this operation.   This question also is being actively followed up.25. In addition, the Admiralty, through the Naval Attache acting under instructions of the British Minister in Bucharest and in concert with the French,are organising naval arrangements on the Danube with a view not only to preventing the Germans from jostling us off the river in the existing conditions,but also to the possibility of a German invasion of Roumania.26. In conclusion, we wish to thank Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd and his Sub-Committee for an invaluable Report.(Signed) HANKEY.CHATFIELD.

WAR CABINET.COMMITTEE ON THE GERMAN OIL POSITION.Note by the Chairman.AS a result of a request by the Chief of the Air Staff, a Sub-Committee was set up under my Chairmanship shortly after the war started to report on theGerman oil position. Our report was dated the 18th October, 1939. We havenow reviewed our Report in the light of six months&apos; war experience and submit the accompanying Second Report.2. While we are now able to estimate the German oil position with greateraccuracy, there are still so many unpredictable factors, both as regards supplyand consumption, that our conclusions can only be stated in the broadest terms.3. We are, of course, now on sounder grounds both as regards Germany&apos;ssupplies and consumption for the first six months; but, in estimating herconsumption during the second six months of the war, we have thought itdesirable to estimate for a continuation of restricted warfare, as at present, aswell as for more active conditions. In a series of tables at the end of the report we have indicated the probable consumption for varying degrees of activity.4.   Very briefly, we have drawn the following broad conclusions : (i) Germany&apos;s stocks on the 1st March, 1940, had probably been reducedto about If million tons. We consider that her oil situation as awhole would become critical if stocks were reduced to about1 million tons.(ii) If the German forces remain more or less inactive for the next sixmonths and a fairly high rate of importation from Roumania and russia is achieved and maintained, Germany should be able to keepher stocks above the danger-point. By the end of the year her rateof supply might begin to exceed her rate of consumption.(iii) If Germany elects or is compelled to undertake a high degree of activity in all armed forces in the coming months, it is hard to see how under present conditions she can avert a serious situation before next winter.(iv) There are, of course, varying degrees of activity between (ii) and (iii)above. For example, Germany should be able to conduct an intensivesubmarine and air compaign against British shipping and portswithout risk of an early breakdown in respect of oil.(v) Apart.from Germany&apos;s oil position as a whole, her ability to conductwar may be vitally affected by a lack of adequate supplies of certain essential products, such as lubricating oil and diesel oil, both ofwhich seem to be weak points in her oil economy.5. As a corollary to these conclusions, it seems that, if the matter isregarded solely from the point of view of Germany&apos;s petroleum supplies, herdifficulties would be increased by any action calculated (a) to induce Germany to undertake more active operations;(b) as circumstances permit, to hamper domestic production and prevent its development;(c) to lead to the destruction of reserves;(d) to restrict further Germany&apos;s oil imports from Roumania and Russia;(e) to prevent Germany obtaining additional supplies by evasion of the contraband control or from the considerable stocks in adjacent neutral countries, more particularly supplies of lubricating and diesel oils, ofwhich German stocks appear to be in short supply.(Signed) GEOFFREY LLOYD.March 15, 1940.[20938]

Second Report.OUR first report* was submitted on the 13th October, 1939, within six weeks of the outbreak of war. In the limited time at our disposal we endeavoured to collate all the information then available which was necessarily based uponconditions during a time of peace, albeit a state of armed peace in Germany, and upon assumptions of a general character. While September had been a periodof intense activity on the Polish front, it was not possible to foretell the policyof the enemy in the conduct of the war in other areas and the effect of that policy on the consumption of petroleum products by the several branches ofthe armed forces. As we then indicated, Naval consumption was based on the degree of activity then expected. The Army figure was based on operations bya definite number of divisions, but the intensity of these operations was a matterof assumption. The Air Force consumption was estimated on an average levelof operational and training activity with a warning that it might vary withinwide limits. For the requirements on the civil and industrial side we couldonly assume a general percentage reduction as a result of probable economies.To-day we have had actual experience of six months of a state of warand we have been able to examine the whole field in greater detail. It is thuspossible to estimate with clearer knowledge of actual conditions the consumptionof the services during the first six months and for the first year, assuming that thewar continues on present lines. If a more active policy is adopted in the future,its intensity and effect upon consumption must still remain a matter of conjecture,but there is at least some evidence from recent experience. On the civil side wehave the advantage of certain detailed information on restrictive regulations forthe enforcement of economy in Germany to which reference is made later in thisreport.In the sphere of supply, we know the actual imports of the first five months,and can estimate with a greater degree of assurance the probable course of supply in the latter half of the year. Thus, while the conclusions of this present reportmust still necessarily be based to a considerable degree upon assumption andconjecture, we feel able to submit these conclusions with this caution but with more assurance than before.I. Stocks of Petroleum Products on September 1, 1939.1.   In our first report we estimated that the total stocks on commercial and government account, on the 1st September, 1939, amounted to 2f-3 million tons,and we accepted the higher figure in accordance with our general policy of cautionin estimating the position in a light favourable to Germany.   We have had no evidence since October which would lead us to alter this estimate.  It is true thatthe French Ministry of Blockade, whose investigations we have been able to con-sider, thought that initial stocks might amount to 4 million metric tons.   If,however, our estimate of German tankage at a total capacity of 4 million tonst is correct -and we have no reason to doubt its accuracy the French figure must be too high, as the experience of experts proves that the actual amount in store at any vtime would not exceed 75 per cent, of the storage capacity.   In particular con- *firmation of this point, we have been informed by two oil companies that, at the Ioutbreak of war, the tanks controlled by them in Germany were by no means filled jto normal capacity.   We have been informed by the Air Ministry that recent \aerial reconnaissance, though limited in extent, affords, so far as it goes, no support to a suggestion which came to our notice, that the volume of Germantankage might be greatly in excess of that upon which our estimate is based.* Paper No. P.O.G. 1 (also Annex to Papers Nos. W.P. (39) 90, and C.O.S. (39) 79).f Note. Throughout the Report &quot; tons &quot; are statute tons unless otherwise stated.   A metricton equals -9812 of a statute ton.
II. Estimated Annual Rate of Consumption from September 1, 1939.2.   The estimates which we adopted for our first report were as follows : First first months. 12 months.Tons. Tons.Army       ...      ...       ......      725,000 1,625,000Navy       ............      600,000 1,200,000Air Force............      700,000 1,400,0002,025,000 4,225,000Civil and Industrial     ......    3,000,000 6,000,000Total ......      5,025,000 10,225,0003. Since October the continuance of relatively static conditions of warfareon a scale which could not be foreseen, has necessitated considerable reduction inthe estimates of German consumption made by the Service Departments for thefirst six months. As regards the second half of the first year of the war, we pro-pose to submit two separate estimates, the first on the assumption that the staticconditions, which have been in existence since October, will continue with no greatchange, the second on the assumption that the period from March to August willbe marked by a greater degree of activity. We recognise that warfare may not be pursued with increased activity in all three spheres of operation sea, land andair, simultaneously, and therefore, while, for the sake of brevity, we continue topresent the estimates in two forms only, we propose at the end of the Report(Tables V-VI) to indicate the result upon the consumption of petroleum of an intermediate situation in which increased activity would be presumed to affectonly two of the three fighting services. On the first basis, that of a year&apos;s staticwarfare, the revised estimates for the Armed Services are : &apos;First first months. 12 months.Tons. Tons.Army       ............      591,000 1,120,000Navy............      300,000 600,000Air Force .........      575,000 1,140,0001,466,000 2,860,0004. On the basis of six months&apos; static warfare and increased activity duringthe second half of the year, the figures will be First first months. 12 months.Tons. Tons.Army       ............      591,000 1,440,000Navy       ............      300,000 900,000Air Force          .........      575,000 1,330,0001,466,000 3,670,0005. The experience of the past six months has thus caused the service departments to effect substantial reductions in their original estimates, and thereasons which have led to these modifications are explained in some detail in thefirst Appendix to this Report. We confine ourselves here to a brief reference,repeating at the head of each section the figures set forth above.6.   Army. First first months. 12 months.Tons.

For the static period of six months a consumption of 591,000 tons has been assumed, compared with 725,000 tons in the October estimate. This includes thespecially heavy expenditure of 123,000 tons in September on account of the Polishcampaign, and assumes the existence of 137 Divisions from October to February.If static conditions continue on the present scale for a further period of sixmonths, it is estimated that the expenditure of petroleum for that period will bereduced to 529,000 tons. This reduction is due to the fact that considerableeconomy in the use of motor spirit, &amp;c, will be rendered possible by thecontinuance of the period of quiescence. There is evidence that much greater use is being made of rail transport to rail heads near the front and that lightrailway facilities are being developed, thus enabling considerable economy in theuse of motor vehicles.If a period of increased activity follows the static period which has prevailedtill the present, it is estimated necessarily on assumptions as to the degree ofthat activity that the consumption will rise to 849,000 tons in the second sixmonths, based on a force of 154 Divisions for March, and 173 Divisions for therest of the period.7.

Static conditions inthis case assume the maintenance of a state of efficiency in the Navy involving a minimum consumption of petroleum on a limited number of days at sea, for different naval units, throughout the year. Allowance is also made for raidingoperations by a pocket battleship or cruiser for six months and for the main-tenance at sea of 5 submarines and a number of miscellaneous craft throughoutthe year, as the best measures of harassing the Allies with the least possiblecost in oil. For more active operations in the second six months, the admiralty have preserved their original estimate of 600,000 tons, which, with the additionof 300,000 tons for the static period, gives 900,000 tons for the whole year.8.

By December it was possible to take account of the scale of operations in force up to date and the Air Ministry reported to the Committeea reduction to 400,000 tons for the first six months and 1,000,000 tons for thewhole year. The estimates are now altered to 575,000 tons and 1,140,000 tons,respectively, for static conditions, but, if more active conditions prevail due tobetter weather, increased operations on the Western Front, or other causes, then the estimate for the second period of six months is raised to 755,000 tons, giving1,330,000 for the whole year.The calculations are based on the estimated number of types of front-line aircraft, plus aircraft for training and miscellaneous flying; and our standardof 35 flying hours per aircraft and trained crew per month has been taken as thepractical figure for the German Air Force also. Account has also been taken of a probable increase of 480 aircraft in first-line strength during March-August 1940.9.   Civil and Industrial.First 6 months.Tons.1,880,000First 12 months.Tons.3,500,000The revision of this estimate has been a matter of considerable difficulty.We have taken into consideration three main questions : (a) to what extentcan it be assumed that Germany will impose restrictions upon civil consumption
as part of the solution of her difficulties in respect of the supply of petroleum;(&amp;) what are likely to be the limitations of any such policy of enforced economy;(c) can any guidance be obtained from our own experience of the effect of rationing or other war conditions upon the consumption of petroleum in thiscountry.10. In 1938 Germany imported a total of 5^ million tons of crude petroleum and petroleum products. Of this amount, over 4 million tons came from sources in America, which are now closed to her. Her internal production from her owncrude oil and by synthetic process amounted to 1-8 million tons in that year.The consumption of the armed forces during the first year of the war islikely (paragraphs 3-8) to range from 2-86 million to 3-67 million tons,according to the degree of activity which may be adopted during the next sixmonths. It would be possible for Germany to continue a scale of civilconsumption at the annual rate of 6f million tons only by drawing heavily uponreserves, increasing local production and by larger importation from the sourcesstill remaining open to her. The extent to which these resources are limited willbe discussed in the following section of this report; but there is ample evidencethat Germany has been forced by the loss of imports from the west and by increased demands for the pursuit of the war to restrict the supply to the civilpopulation while preserving, as far as possible, the output of her munitions andother essential industry.A summary of some of the measures which have been taken in Germany isgiven in Appendix II, from which it would appear that drastic restrictions havebeen imposed, for example, on private motoring and long-distance goods traffic.The aim in the former case was, according to the Reich Ministry of Transport,to secure a reduction of at least 85 per cent, in petrol consumption. Further,conversion to other forms of fuel has been in progress for some years before thewar, and it is clear that every effort is being made to accelerate this measure of economy. It must be remembered that for the fulfilment of any plans of retrench-ment upon which they may decide the German authorities have developed uniquepowers of enforcement.11. There must, however, be a limit to the extent to which a reduction canbe enforced in the consumption of petroleum on civil account, and this limit is imposed by the mobilisation of German industry for war purposes. any economies which may be effected in non-essential industries are likely to beswallowed up by the paramount needs of her industries in war time.We have therefore assumed, after making allowances for the use of alternativefuels, that no material reduction can be expected in the consumption of gasand diesel oil by stationary industrial engines in the first year, and even thathigher consumption will occur in the case of lubricating oil on the industrialside. We have also left untouched the requirements for tractors for agricultural and general industrial use.12. The experience which has been gained under war conditions in Britainand France has been taken into consideration, but it can serve only as a generalguide owing to the extent to which conditions in Germany differ from thosewhich regulate economy of consumption in the former countries. Further details are given in Appendix I.13. After a careful study of all the evidence we have come tothe conclusion that we should adopt a total of 3J million tons as areasonable estimate of civil consumption in Germany in the first year of thewar, a reduction of 48 per cent, in the estimated peace-time figure. Thebasis of the calculations is indicated in some detail in Appendix I. in arriving at our decision as to civil consumption, we have taken account of threeestimates made independently by the Petroleum Division and two of the principaloil companies. When the necessary adjustments have been made to bring theestimates upon the same level, that framed by Mr. Godber of the Shell oil company comes to about 3J million tons, while that framed by Sir WilliamFraser of the Anglo-Iranian Company comes to about 3J million tons. Theestimate framed by the Petroleum Division gives a total reduction to 3^ million tons over the whole of the year. This total has been apportioned over the year with the result that during the last half of the year consumption has been brought down to 3J million tons a year, thereby giving effect to progressive attainment of economy.
14. The estimates of consumption, discussed in the preceding paragraphs,are summarised below : (I) For static warfare throughout the year :  First first months. 12 months.Tons.

Sources of Supply.Domestic Production.15. We estimated in the first report that domestic production from crude oil and by synthetic operations would produce about 3 million tons in the first year. Of this total one-third is derived from crude and two-thirds from syntheticprocess. The corresponding actual production in 1938 was about 1-85 million tons, of which 600,000 tons was from crude, and 1-25 million tons from syntheticsources. Various other estimates have come to notice, including those of theFrench Ministry of Blockade and of the two oil companies, which have given usvaluable assistance in the enquiry, and the figures tend to vary between 2^ and34 million tons. On the whole, we consider that the estimate of 3 million tonsshould be retained, but we allow for a progressive increase to an annual rate of3J million tons towards the end of the year. We do not think that Germany&apos;capacity for domestic production is likely to be greater than this before 1941.Erection of new plant is highly specialised and takes considerable time, whilethe necessary steels and catalysts are said to be in short supply.Imports.16. The present main sources of import are confined to Russia (includingRussian Poland) and Roumania. In addition, we have now to note two sourceswhich were not specially mentioned in the first report, namely, a certain supplyof shale oil from Estonia and the supplies secured by evasion of contraband)control, which were considerable in the first month or two of the war, but havenow been reduced to almost negligible amounts.A separate memorandum on the import situation has been added as appendix III to show the position in detail, and we need only refer here in briefto the main considerations.Russia and Poland.17. In the October report we came to the conclusion that Russia could notexport any material quantity of Petroleum to Germany, except at the expense ofher own industry and agriculture, a sacrifice which it was unlikely she wouldmake. We also drew attention to the transport difficulties. We have beeninformed of a recent contract for the supply by Russia of 100,000 tons ofpetroleum products (largely gas oil and lubricants). By the end of January34.000 tons had been supplied, and there was evidence of transport difficultieswhich will spread out the delivery. A further 22,000 tons were delivered inFebruary, while some 24,000 tons were landed in western ports of the Black[20938] B 3First12 months.Tons.3,670,0003,500,0007,170,000
Sea to be held on German account. There were also small supplies of shale oil from Estonia, amounting to 21,000 tons in the first three months of the war.These supplies have ceased for the present, but may be resumed later.18. It is known that the supplies from all these sources in the first sixmonths of the war have been less than 100,000 tons. From March to the end ofAugust, allowing for improvements in the transport arrangements and for anincreased output from the oilfields in Russian Poland, we estimate that theminimum supply from these sources will be about 250,000 tons and the maximum500,000 tons. The latter estimate might be exceeded if Russia were able and willing to allow Germany a larger share of her 30 million tons of oil production. In the past Russia has had little surplus for export, the total in1938 being only 1-3 million tons. Against this she imported in the same yearabout 1 million tons of petroleum products. Russia might, possibly with the aid of German technicians, be able to export to Germany on a higher scale than wehave assumed, but the transport difficulty has still to be surmounted. This mightbe achieved if Germany were allowed to exercise some measure of control overthe Russian transport system, and if regular transport over the Black Sea withimproved facilities from the ports in Bulgaria and Roumania were satisfactorilyorganised. Recent reports indicate that measures are already being taken todevelop this route.Roumania.19. Actual imports of petroleum products into Germany for the first threemonths of the war amounted to 277,000 tons, an average of 92,000 tons a month.This fell to 68,000 tons in December. Owing to the freezing of the Danube and difficulties of rail transport, supplies in January fell further to 32,000 tons.About the same quantity was received in February. During the first six months the total supply from this source will be about 409,000 tons,compared with 800,000 tons estimated in the October report. Havingregard to the transport position and certain difficulties of purchase, weconsider that for the whole of the first year the supply from Roumania should for present purposes be estimated at about 1 -1 million tons at the lowest, andmay rise to 1-4 million tons, under the recent arrangement by which germany will obtain an annual quota of about 1-J million tons, while the attainment ofsupplies on the scale estimated depends upon the ability to provide adequatetransport.20. If Germany were to proceed to the extreme measure of military actionagainst Roumania, then, in the event of resistance, it is probable that disorganisation-tion and delay would prevent Germany from obtaining more than the maximumwe have suggested in the time left to her, but, if, under a system of duress,Roumania became the economic vassal of Germany, a different situation would arise.Contraband.21. We were unable, in the absence of information, to take account of this factor in the earlier report. We are now informed that in the first six monthsGermany will have obtained, at the most, about 200,000 tons by evasion of contraband control, and most of this slipped through in the first month or two.If conditions of control remain as at present, it is thought that the leakage maybe negligible in quantity during the second half of the year; it may be none theless important, however, in that if it takes place it will probably consist largelyof packed lubricating oils and greases. In this connection we have been informed/of the existence of considerable stocks of petroleum products in neutral countriesadjacent to Germany. Italy may have as much as 3 million tons (mostly crudeand gas oil) and is increasing her reserves. Hollands earlier stock of 650.000 tonshas been increased to 850,000 tons, equal to eight months&apos; requirements. belgium and the Scandinavian countries have also been building up stocks. All theI jeountries concerned insist that such stocks are required, partly for economic andjpartly for defence needs. Those countries with whom War Trade agreements have been negotiated have undertaken not to re-export their stocks to Germany;but their existence, particularly in the Low Countries, may be an additionaltemptation to Germany to threaten or invade these countries in order to secure their supplies.
Danger point in balances of stocks.23. It is probable that a country which is gradually exhausting itsavailable reserves of petroleum products will find that difficulties present them-selves in one kind of product, e.g.. lubricating oil or gas oil, before another.Nevertheless, it may be useful to consider at what point German stocks ofpetroleum products as a whole might on various hypotheses be reduced to a precarious level. We have taken competent advice on this subject and ourconclusion is that, while difficulties would have shown themselves in failuresof distribution at an earlier point, the situation would become critical when thetotal stocks of the country were reduced to about one million tons. In summarisingour conclusions, we are therefore adopting this figure as a criterion. At thesame time, as there is evidence that Germany is in a state of difficulty asregards the supply of gas, Diesel and lubricating oils, we are attaching addi-tional statements (Appendices IV and V) of the position in regard to these special products, since it may well be that the influence of petroleum on thewar may turn upon the failure of these essential supplies rather than upon an approaching exhaustion of supplies as a whole.IV. Summary and Conclusions.24. In accordance with our estimates in the previous sections of the report,the position may be summarised as follows : First first six months.        Twelve months.Minimum.   Maximum.Resources Stocks...*Domestic productionRussia, Estonia, &amp;c...RoumaniaContraband evasion ...5,105 7,680 8,230* These figures assume a gradual increase in the rate of production throughout the year.[20938] C(In thousands of tons.)3,000 3,000 3,0001,400 3,000 3,000100 350 600405 1,100 1,400200 230 230SHSBHBIHi!We would, however, emphasise that, if the undertakings given in respect jof these stocks in neutral countries, particularly those in the Netherlands orin Italy, with whom we have at present no war trade agreements, are not observed,Germany may obtain sufficient oil to tide her over periods of acute stringencyuntil her domestic production increases or imports arrive in larger volume from roumania or the Soviet Union.22. In regard to the transport position we have received the following &apos;appreciation from the Ministry of Economic Warfare : &apos;&quot;&apos; The quantity of oil which Germany will obtain this year from roumania seems likely to depend more on transportation facilities than the exportable surplus available. The same may also apply to German receipts from the U.S.S.R., as it has done up to the present. The limitations oftransport can be narrowed down to the provision of sufficient tankers, tankbarges and tank wagons, since the railway tracks available for the service from the Black Sea coast, whether it be South Russia, Roumania or Bulgaria,are capable of carrying several times the number of petroleum trains thatare at present passing along them. Similarly, the capacity of the Danube(when free from ice) is limited by the number of tugs and tanker bargesavailable for the service in question. Germany is intensively manufacturing-railway tank wagons, a proportion of which are being fitted with axlesadjustable to run either on the broad or standard gauge, but it is at presentimpossible to forecast the rate at which they will be made available. Sheis also manufacturing additional barges suitable for the transport ofpetroleum via the Danube.&quot;

The summary given above shows the relation between supply and consumption as a whole according to the volume of imports and the degree of activity in warfare. We have, however, found it useful to consider the variations in the oil position, throughout the course of the year, in a more detailed form which would indicate the gradual expansion in domestic production and thedecreasing demands for civil purposes owing to the progressive effect of economy measures. It also seemed desirable to show the effects of the variation in therate of supply from Roumania and elsewhere during certain months and of theconsumption on the Polish campaign in September 1939. Further, as we havestated in paragraph 23, we have estimated that the situation in Germany couldbe regarded as dangerous if stocks were reduced to the level of about one million tons. The approach to that level could most conveniently be shown in a form which indicated the gradual drafts upon reserve stocks. We therefore caused to be prepared for our consideration a series of tables which would representthe possible results of different combinations of the determining factors, on theassumption that our conclusions as to the value of these factors were approximately correct. These factors are : the extent of initial stocks, the rateof domestic production, the amount of importation, the requirements of the armed forces and lastly the requirements for civil and industrial purposes.26. We have included these tables at the end of this report but we do so with an emphatic caution that the calculations in these tables are in no way to beregarded as presenting estimates of mathematical precision but rather as giving a general synopsis of the situation setting out the broad results of our enquiry in a convenient form. These tables must, we emphasise, be viewed with the samecautious reserve as we ourselves have adopted in drawing any inferences from them for the reason that conjecture and assumption must necessarily be presentin the estimate of all the determining factors.27. Subject to these essential cautions, we feel that our review brings out a general conclusion that a moderate increase or decrease in the volume ofpetroleum products may, in certain circumstances, make all the difference to. Germany&apos;s power of resistance, a conclusion which is supported by reasonableinference from the frequent peregrinations of Dr. Clodius to Roumania, hungary and elsewhere in a zealous endeavour to acquire relatively small quantities of oil.It is of vital importance to Germany to increase, by every possible means, her supplies of petroleum which have been so severely restricted by the blockade, a situation which again emphasises the danger of&apos; the accumulation of stock in neighbouring neutral countries.* These figures assume that the economy of civil consumption is secured by gradual stages in the earlier months.
In particular we feel able to draw the following broad conclusions : (i) The stocks of petroleum products have probably, by the beginning ofMarch 1940, been reduced to about If million tons, partly becauseof the heavy expenditure on the Polish campaign and partly becausethe restriction on civil consumption and the expansion of internalproduction had not yet come into full operation.(ii) A policy of inactive&apos; warfare for the next six months, aided by asubstantial measure of success in her efforts to increase importationfrom Roumania and Russia, might enable Germany to maintain herstocks well above the danger point of a million tons. By the end ofthe year the tide might have turned and supply might exceed herrate of consumption.(iii) On the other hand if, in the coming months, Germany elects or is driven to pursue a higher degree of activity in all arms of the fighting forces,it is probable that, under present conditions, a serious situation may develop in her oil economy before next winter.(iv) If the increased activity were confined to two spheres of operation, she could intensify her warfare at sea and increase her attacks from theair upon British shipping and ports without risking an earlyexhaustion of her reserves, though, here again, grave difficulties might arise in the course of next winter,(v) It may well prove that a limitation upon her ability to pursue the war may be set by failure of such essential products as lubricating oil anddiesel oil rather than by an approaching exhaustion of supplies as aAvhole.28. From these conclusions it is possible to make the following furtherinferences : It appears to be to the advantage of Germany to maintain static conditionsuntil: (i) the advantages of any increased production by hydrogenation and otherprocesses can be reaped;(ii) the full benefit of restricted consumption by and conversion of private and public transport vehicles is attained;(iii) arrangements to extract larger supplies from Roumania and Russia andto reorganise transport therefrom have been completed.On the other hand it would seem that the advantage of the Allies is in thedirection of measures which will (a) induce Germany to undertake more active operations leading to a more rapid consumption of oil;(5) hamper, as circumstances permit,  domestic production and preventfurther development thereof;(c) lead to the destruction of reserves;(d) continue to restrict by any feasible means her attempts to import oil from Roumania and russia;(e) prevent Germany obtaining additional supplies through the contraband control or from stocks held in adjacent neutral countries. This isparticularly important as regards lubricating and diesel oils of whichthere is already a shortage in the country.Signed on behalf of the CommitteeGEOFFREY LLOYD.Richmond Terrace, S.W.I.[20938]
APPENDIX I.Summary of Methods of Calculation of Consumption of Petroleum byArmed Services and on Civil and Industrial Activities in Germany.A rmy.THE estimate for a year combining static and active warfare was calculatedby the War Office as follows : No. of   Estimated consumptionDivisions. in Tons.September 1939 /Polish campaign)        122 123,000October to February 1940 ......        137 468.000March 1940 ...     &apos;.........        154 137,000April to August 1940      ......        173 712,000Total       ...............       1,440,000The consumption in tons was arrived at by calculating activity in terms ofassumed percentage of active to quiet days with reference to the number of vehicles attached to the various types of units. During quiet periods consumptionhas been estimated at 2 gallons per vehicle per day and during active periodsat 5 gallons per vehicle per day, figures based on our own rates of consumption.The figures for a year of inactivity (1,120,000 tons) are reached on a similar basis, but account is taken of economies in petrol during quiet conditions bygreater use of railheads close to the front, and development of light railways.Navy.The revised consumption for a year of static warfare is based on certain assumptions which allow for the minimum expenditure necessary to keep theGerman fleet in a state of efficiency and also for operations which will harassthe enemy and yet be economical in fuel.   The main items are :  Tons.340,00030,000for18,00018,000180,000586,000For a period of activity in the second six months of the war, it is assumed that this rate of consumption will be doubled.Air.The original estimate assumed a consumption of 700,000 tons for the first six months and 1,400,000 tons for the whole year. These figures were reduced in December to 400,000 tons and 1,000,000 tons respectively with reference toexperience gained as to the scale of operations. It will be noted that thisassumed a higher rate of consumption for the second six months for greateractivity. If static warfare continues for the whole year then consumption isnow assumed at 1,140,000 tons, which includes the heavy consumption of 125,000tons on the Polish campaign. If active conditions supervene after February, thetotal consumption will be raised to 1,330,000 tons. The calculations are basedon the estimated number of types of front-line aircraft, plus aircraft for training and miscellaneous flying; and our standard of 35 flying hours per month peraircraft and trained crew has been taken as the practical figure for the german air Force also. Account has also been taken of a probable increase of 480 aircraft in first-line strength during March-August 1940.One day at sea per week for bulk of fleet   ...One 3-day cruise per month for certain unitsOne  Pocket  Battleship  or  cruiser  raiding6 months ...5 U-Boats always at sea     ...       ...       ...30 Miscellaneous craft always at sea
Civil Consumption.: r &apos;&apos;&apos; &quot;  &quot;...        .The estimate in the first report was arrived at by reducing the calculatedpeace consumption before the war by 25 per cent, to allow for the general effectof economy in the use of motor transport which could not at the time be estimated in greater detail. As a foundation of some stability an estimate of consumptionhas been adopted which is based upon German statistics and checked withreference to the figures of importation and local production for 1938, for which full details exist. In the absence of evidence on the point, it is assumed for present purposes that there were no material additions to or reductions of stocksincluded in this total figure of 1\ million tons. From this amount a deduction hashad to be made to the extent of 750,000 tons, which represents estimated issues(excluding naval bunker oil) to the Armed Forces in peace time, thus leaving the true Civil consumption at 6f million tons approximately.To arrive at an estimate of economy it has been necessary to calculate theprobable consumption of the known numbers of various types of registered enginesin Germany, and then to assume, having regard to the restrictions imposed, a percentage rate of reduction for each class, which must, of course, be a matter ofconjecture. The result, in the case of motor spirit, is an over-all reduction of58 per cent., which includes an average reduction of 75 per cent, in the case ofprivate cars and motor cycles.In the course of the enquiry the experience gained in this country has been considered, but it furnishes merely a general guide, owing to the widedifferences in conditions in Britain and Germany. Britain undoubtedly suffersfrom a shortage of tanker tonnage under present conditions, while for financial reasons it has been necessary to reduce the requirements of foreign exchange forthe purchase of oil. For these reasons the rationing of petrol has been introduced,and while higher taxation limits the use of cars, &amp;c, Britain has not, however, sofar considered it necessary to apply draconian restrictions of the kind enforcedin Germany.Further, it is evident that Britain is on a higher plane of development in respect of the use of petroleum. For example, in the case of petrol alone,this country, with her much smaller population, used 5 million tons a year for civil purposes before the war, while Greater Germany required only 3J million tons. For gas, diesel and fuel oil, the consumption in this country is about3J million tons, compared with Germany&apos;s 2\ million tons.The conclusion might be drawn that there is therefore much less scope for economy in Germany; on the other hand, it may well be that a country, whichhas been accustomed to a lower standard of petroleum consumption, can more easily submit to a restrictive economy than one which is enured to a larger measure,of comfort and convenience in this field. In any case, the determining factoris in reality the available range of supply under war conditions.The economies effected in the United Kingdom by direct rationing and higher taxation may be briefly indicated.For a period of five months from September 1939 to January 1940 thetotal consumption of motor spirit was 1 - 44 million tons, compared with 1 - 9 million tons consumed in the corresponding five months from September 1938. Thereis thus a reduction of about 24 per cent. In the whole of the first year ofthe war it is estimated that the consumption of petrol in this country will beabout 3^ million tons, compared with 5 million tons in the year before the war,a reduction of 33^ per cent. In the case of other products the consumptionfor the past five months has fallen by less than 10 per cent, in the case ofkerosene and of gas, diesel and fuel oils, while, so far, there is a small increaseof about 10 per cent, in the case of lubricating oil. The total consumption ofpetroleum products on civil account for the first year of the war is likely tohe about 8 million tons, compared with 9-7 million tons before the war.As regards the experience of France, it is understood that consumption of motor spirit in December 1939was 38 per cent, below the consumption in December.1938; in January 1940 the corresponding figure was 35 per cent., and it isconsidered that the average level of consumption in war time will be about35 per cent, below the peace-time average. Products other than motor spiritare said to be generally maintaining their normal peace level.The reductions of 58 per cent, for motor spirit and of 33^ per cent, forgas and cliesel oil which have been estimated in the case of Germany are much
greater than those which are calculated in the cases of Britain and of France,but the figures appear to be justified by the general situation in which germany is placed in respect of supply and by evidence of the drastic restrictions which she has been forced to adopt.The position may be summarised as follows (figures in thousands of tons) : Normal ReducedConsumption.

Conversion will take place in easy stages, startingwith the heavier gasoline engine units, to be followed by lighter lorries(down to \\ tons carrying capacity) and concluding with tractors. Care is tobe taken that the vehicles can at any time return to the use of liquid fuels.In order to reduce fuel consumption, the maximum speed of motor carshas been restricted to 25 m.p.h., in built-up areas, and to 50 m.p.h. elsewhere.Lorries and buses must not exceed 37 m.p.h.As from the 1st November fuel ration cards have been issued. these were accompanied by a warning that the supply of mineral oils, particularly for private cars, must be regulated &quot; according to the most rigid standards.&quot;The. use. of.....motor cars for private purposes was forbidden.   The police hadthe right to question motor users, the penalty for using cars for other than&quot;vital&quot; purposes being punishable by the forfeit of the right to obtain further supplies of fuel. The Reich Ministry of Transport declared that theI  consumption of petrol must be reduced by 85 per cent.&apos; No motor car manufacturer may accept an order without production ofan &apos;&apos; urgency &apos;&apos; certificate issued by a Chamber of Commerce or some other authority.The Central Office for mineral oils, a Government Department, has takencontrol of part of the German filling station system.   Stations which had
not been taken over were allowed to continue selling fuel to motorists inpossession of ration cards, but bad to close down immediately their stocks were exhausted. The decision as to which filling stations will be permitted to carry on will be made according to considerations of &quot; war economy.&quot;In a recent Decree issued by the Minister of Transport the Tramwaycompanies have been urged to adapt their rolling stock for the&quot; conveyance of goods. This use of the Tramways, the Minister points out, should be-regarded not simply as an emergency measure, but as one to be retained in normal times.As from the 1st January special licences for long-distance services havebeen suspended. Private undertakings will no longer be allowed to use theirlorries for distances exceeding 50 kilom. (about 30 miles), while if theirlorries are not fully loaded they may be required to carry supplementary loadsfor other firms. It is hoped, that these regulations will reduce further thenumber of motor vehicles in use, with a corresponding saving of motor fuel.With the same object a recent Decree prohibits the use of farm tractorsfor transport purposes or as stationary engines; old steam engines, electricmotors, or engines running on gas being recommended for the latter purpose.Further restrictions are being put in force in 1940. The running ofprivate cars will be prohibited unless the owner can satisfy the police, who willpatrol the roads, that his business or professional errand could not be accom-plished by other means. Uses for purely pleasure purposes are liable to be punished by imprisonment.2. The following reports are indicative of Germany&apos;s policy in regard to substitute fuels and the extent of the development in this direction&quot; over the past few years. They clearly show that Germany was doing everything possible to cutdown the consumption of petroleum products in war time to a minimum and thatshe must now be reaping a considerable advantage from her foresight : -British Embassy, Berlin, September 1938.&quot; The proportion of gas-propelled vehicles registered during 1937 was still very small as compared with the total of new vehicles, though it showed signs ofincreasing.&quot; The initial subsidy granted in 1936 to encourage the use of gas-producervehicles was discontinued in March 1938, but tax rebates continued. The fuel is,of course, untaxed. At present about 12,000 lorries, about one-seventh of the totalnumber, are understood to be using compressed or liquefied gas, and by the end of1938 about 25,000 gas-driven lorries are expected to be on the roads, includingabout 70 per cent, of all municipal vehicles.&quot;German Press, May 1939.   Liquid Gas.&quot; Great progress has been made with the conversion of omnibuses to liquefiedgas propulsion, the number of such vehicles having risen from 4,300 at the end of1936 to over 19,000 at the end of 1938. The gaseous fuel which is the by-product of the coal-hydrogenation industry is marketed in steel cylinders, of which some120,000 are now in circulation.German Regidations, 1939.&quot; All buses seating more than 16 passengers must run on gas from the1st October, 1939.&quot;It was reported that in Berlin alone over 1,000 vehicles were operating ongas in December 1939.German Press, October 1939.   Producer Gas.&quot; 2,200 vehicles were operating on producer gas generated from wood. Therewere 1,000 filling stations supplying dry wood for the purpose situated at intervals20-25 miles apart.&quot;The Engineer, December 1939.&apos;&apos; German authorities have ordered the conversion of all petrol-engined lorriesof over 1-g tons capacity to use propane or butane fuel.   The conversion will be
carried out at a uniform charge of about  20 per vehicle. Liquid gas production will be sufficient for about 45,000 vehicles out of the 115,000 in use before thewar.&quot;Press Cutting, 1940.&apos;&apos; 40,000 out of 500,000 heavy lorries recently took the road with compressedliquid gas in place of petrol tanks. The gas is propane-butane,.froin coal. Iftrials prove a success new plant will be built to feed whole heavy transport fleet and so release large quantities of diesel oil and petrol.&quot;January 1940.&quot; Issue of kerosene permitted only to those works which are engaged on munitions.&quot;APPENDIX III.Importation of Petroleum Products by Germany from Russia, Estonia,Roumania, or through Neutral Countries by evasion of contraband control.(1) Russia, Estonia, Poland.The October report stated that, in view of Russia&apos;s greatly increased demandfor petroleum products for her own economic development and in view of thegreat difficulties in the transport of substantial quantities, it was unlikely that russia would find it possible to export to Germany in the first year any significantquantity of petroleum. So far as the Polish area was concerned, it was estimatedthat the average Polish production in previous years was only 500,000 tons perannum, which was mainly required for local consumption. The capacity of polish production was temporarily decreased by destruction of wells andrefineries during the invasion. No separate reference was made to supplies of oil from Estonia.On the 20th December, 1939, the U.S.S.R. agreed to deliver to Germany100,000 tons of petroleum products, comprising 77,000 tons of gas, fuel andlubricating oils and 22,000 tons of aviation and motor spirit. The supplies wereto be delivered before the end of January, but provision was made for extensionof the period, if necessary, and it appears that the sources of the supply wereto be the Caucasus and Polish Galicia, in the latter case probably from stocksseized by the Russians on their invasion in September. In the original agree-ment the Germans were to be responsible for sending tank cars or lorries tofetch away the Galician quota, while the Soviet Government agreed to railthe Caucasian quota from Odessa to Przemysl.There is evidence of considerable difficulties in carrying out the contractowing to failure of transport on both sides. The Germans failed to providerolling stock to remove Galician oil and to provide facilities for trans-port from Przemysl, probably owing to hard winter conditions. Further,it may be noted tbat the Soviet authorities have expressed inability to deliver Caucasian petroleum to a Baltic port, while the Germans are nowendeavouring to make storage capacity available at Constanza, and also in bulgaria.In view of these difficulties no deliveries had been made in accordancewith the contract till January, but by the end of that month some 34,000 tonshad been delivered. In February nearly 22,000 tons were delivered to germany from Galicia and Odessa, while a further 24,250 tons were landed in Roumania(or perhaps in part in Bulgaria) to be held on German account. While there isno reason to suppose that Germany will not get the full quantity of 100,000 tonsunder the contract, there are good grounds for the assumption that the Russianpotential supply is still limited by her internal needs and by difficulties oftransport.As regards Poland, the total production was about 500,000 tons before thewar. Owing to destruction of wells and refineries during the invasion, it hasbeen estimated that the utmost the Polish area is likely to produce in the first
year of the war is 300,000 tons, of which a third pertains to the German section and two-thirds to the Russian section, but it does not follow that all of thiswould be available for German needs outside the Polish area.As regards Estonia, Germany in the past obtained varying quantities ofshale oil not exceeding 100,000 tons a year. Since the outbreak of war theimports from this area have been 9,300 tons in September, 7,500 tons in october and. 4,100 tons in November; since then the supply has ceased. Altogether itis estimated that Germany will receive from LT.S.S.R., Poland and Estonia notmore than 100,000 tons of petroleum products in the first six months of the war.The supply for the second half of the year is difficult to estimate as it depends upon Russia&apos;s willingness or capability to assist in any further supply, and alsoupon a solution of the transport difficulty, but in all the circumstances it wouldappear that the maximum supply for the second six months is unlikely to exceed500,000 tons from these sources while the probable minimum may be put at250,000 tons.(2) Roumania.The October report stated that, on the basis of the then existing situation,it was unlikely that Germany would obtain in the first year more than 2,000,000tons from that source, of which not more than 800,000 tons would be obtained in the first six months. Combined German and Russian pressure might forceRoumania to grant additional supplies at the expense of other countries, but even if Germany were in effective control of all existing means of transport, themaximum she could possibly get would not exceed 4,000,000 tons.It may be noted in this connection that, in 1938, supplies of petroleum products to Germany from Roumania amounted to 984,000 tons, and in the firsteight months of 1939, before the outbreak of war, to over 900,000 tons.An examination of the position in January indicated that, allowing for a modest off-take of crude oil by contiguous countries, there would remain forrefining in Roumania approximately 5 - 6 million tons, producing about 5 million tons of refined products. Of this, Roumanian consumption and bunkers wouldexhaust about 1-75 million tons, leaving a balance of 3f million tons, or withthe addition of certain drafts from stocks, about 3^ million tons. Normally1 - 4 million tons would be taken by certain Balkan and Mediterranean countriesleaving a residue of about 2 million tons for acquisition by other countries.Various measures for the control of the balance of oil in Allied interests hadbeen taken or contemplated, such as opposition to a quota system; resistance toany proposals on the part of Roumania to force companies under Allied capitalcontrol to sell oil to quarters objected to; policy of purchase in co-operation withthe French; maintenance of the normal trade markets in the Levant and Balkans,and, finally, immobilisation of German transport facilities on the Danube. Theposition has, however, been materially altered by the Roumanian decision to grantGermany a right to a quota of about 130,000 tons a month and to assume full control of the oil industry.A recent examination indicated that, under the most favourable conditions,Germany might be able to secure about 1 - 4 million tons in the first year by rail and river, but, apart from questions of transport, there would be certain difficulties in effecting the purchase of this quantity in the remainder of the year.During that period they might get 525,000 tons from the neutral companies(including American) in Roumania, but, if they are to secure the full quota of1-4 tons for which export facilities under favourable conditions might exist, theAllied companies would have to be called on directly or indirectly to make asubstantial contribution.The actual experience up to date shows that, in the first three months of thewar, Germany obtained 277,000 tons, or an average of 92,000 tons a month, from roumania. This fell to 68,000 tons in December. Owing to the freezing of the danube and difficulties of rail transport, the supplies fell to about 32,000 tons inJanuary, and the February figure is of the same order. Thus during the first six months of the war the total supply from this source will be about 409,000 tons,compared with the estimate of 800,000 tons in the October report. For the wholeof the first year of the war it is now estimated that, in view of the quota, theminimum supply to Germany from Roumania will be about 1 -1 million tons andthe maximum 1 - 4 million tons, compared with the estimate in the October report[20938] D
APPENDIX IV.Note on Germany&apos;s Position in regard to Lubricating Oils.THE following are the figures of import and internal production of allgrades of lubricating oil as regards the old Reich : 19391937. 1938.    (6 months).(Figures in thousands?)Imports............       370 388 175Internal production   ...       ...        140 180 100510 568 275With the addition of supplies available from Austria and Czecho-Slovakia thetotal amount for 1938 may be taken at 600,000 tons.2.   Of the imports in 1938 the following are the main sources : United StatesDutch West IndiesU.S.S.R,Roumania-Others171-2169-833-09050388-0of 2 million tons as the probable supply and 4 million tons as a doubtful absolutemaximum in the extreme case of military pressure by Germany with control ofaii means of transport.It is now considered that, even in the extreme case of military action,resistance to invasion and other forms of action in the oilfields on the part of roumania would make it most unlikely that Germany, in the time left, could secure enough petroleum products in addition to the much reduced supply of thefirst six months to bring the total for the whole year to more than the maximum of 1 - 4 million, tons mentioned above. This excludes the possibility, presumablyremote, that under duress Roumania might soon become the economic vassel ofGermany, concentrating all her efforts on the supply of oil to that country and preventing the execution of all measures designed to limit Germany&apos;s accessthereto.(3) Contraband evasion.No separate consideration was paid to this source of supply in the first report. It is estimated that, in the first six months of the war, up to 200,000 tonsof petroleum products may have passed into Germany by evasion of the control.This figure is possibly an over-estimate and the true figure may not have exceeded150,000 tons. The bulk of this evasion took place in the first month or two ofwar before the control was fully organised. For the second half of the year, if conditions of control continue as at present, the leakage may be negligible in quantity, but none the less important in that it will probably consist chiefly ofpacked lubricating oil and greases. In this connection an important factor lies in the existence of considerable stocks in contiguous neutral countries. It isknown that Italy has accumulated stocks of crude and fuel oil to an extent ofperhaps 3 million tons, and is steadily increasing these stocks. Holland&apos;s originalstock of about 650,000 tons has now been increased to about 850,000 tons. belgium and the Scandinavian countries are building up their reserves. These stocksclose at hand constitute a temptation for Germany, if and when she finds herconsumption of petrol and oils eating into her severely limited stocks and replace-ments, and may result in heavy pressure on, or even invasion of, neutral countries to secure their supplies. This danger is one which must be constantly kept inview in the consideration of this problem.
Thus Germany has been cut off from her main external sources of supply, save in so far as small amounts may succeed in evading, contraband control or as certainsupplies may be drawn from existing stocks in neighbouring neutral countries.To these two potential sources special vigilance is being applied, particularly aslubricating oil is comparatively easy to smuggle. As regards Russia, theconclusion on the general question of supplies of petroleum was that it was unlikely that Russia would find it possible to export to Germany in the first year of war any very great quantity of petroleum and the same conclusionwould seem to apply in the case of lubricating oils. In pre-war years the total exports of Russia were only about 120,000 tons, of which 33,000 tons went toGermany. Under a recent agreement by the U.S.S.R. to supply 100,000 tonsof petroleum products to Germany, 15,000 tons of lubricating oil were included.Roumanian production is inconsiderable; the total production has notexceeded 60,000 tons, of which about half was required for local needs. At themost Germany could not expect to get more than 20,000 tons from this source.Production.3. In the past Germany manufactured lubricants out of a substantialquantity of imported and local crude oil and residues, and had, indeed, aconsiderable export trade amounting to about 100,000 tons a year which has nowceased. The domestic production in 1938 was about 180,000 tons, and thisproduction was blended with a large proportion of the imported oil as it wasnot in itself suitable for use in aircraft or for high-speed purposes generally.In view of the almost total extinction of imported lubricants, Germany mustturn to expansion of domestic production from crude oil and vegetable sources and it is known that her plant has been expanded for this purpose. On thisquestion the French Ministry of Blockade note that &quot;in spite of economies affectedGermany is still vulnerable in respect of supplies of lubricants. The annualconsumption of these oils may be put at 500,000 tons. Her productive capacity is put at about 240,000 tons from synthetic and crude oil sources. Thereforefor the remainder she must draw upon stocks which she has built Up or elseimport the quantities which she needs. She. is at present trying to substitutevegetable oils, and especially soya bean oil, for mineral aviation lubricants, andhas been negotiating for the purchase of such supplies from Roumania and the balkans.&quot;4. The Air Ministry has made a detailed examination of the question of aviation lubricants and their views may be briefly summarised. Peace-time requirements of high-grade lubricants (motor and aircraft) are assessed at140,000 tons, the principal source of which is German crude, oil from which shewill be able to produce 145,000 tons annually from a few specialised plants.In addition, wax derived from Fischer plants is being worked up to aviationlubricating oil to the extent of 25,000 tons. The consumption of aviation oilsis put approximately at 3 per cent, of the aviation petrol. Taking the revisedfigure in the Committee&apos;s first report, of a million tons as the consumption in the first year of war, aviation lubricants will be required to the extent of30,000 tons. The present practical potential supplies of aviation oil are put at80,000 tons from internal products and 25,000 tons from importation; while themaximum potential may be increased to 145,000 tons for internal production,any increase in importation would depend upon Russia&apos;s ability or willingness to help. Thus Germany&apos;s practical potential supplies of aviation oil are farin excess of her war-time requirements, but the more that she has to drawthereon for this purpose, the less she will have for other requirements. Insumming up the air position it is stated that &quot; viewing Germany&apos;s luricating oil position as a whole we are of opinion that her supplies of high grade oilfor all purposes are a definite limiting factor.&quot;Consumption.5. The total peace-time consumption in Greater Germany was about600,000 tons, of which nearly two-thirds was imported. . On the civil side thepre-war consumption was about 150,000 tons for motor vehicles and 450,000 tons for general industrial consumption. The former figures included about35,000 tons required for the armed forces.T20938] D 2
It is known that the severest economy has been imposed on the use of motor vehicles for private and transport purposes in Germany, and possibly theconsumption of lubricating oils may be reduced to 60,000 tons at most as a resultof this economy. It is considered that no economy is likely to be made in theconsumption of lubricating oil used for general industrial purposes. In thiscountry the consumption increased considerably for some months after theoutbreak of war, but is now returning to normal.6.   To sum up, the position for the first year of the war would seem to be : Requirements  Tons. Tons.Defence...............      115,000   to   140,000Civil     ...............      500,000615,000   to   640,000Resources (apart from initial stocks) Imports (say)  ...       ...       ...       ...       75,000Domestic production ...       ...       ...      200,000275,000The proportion of the initial stocks of petroleum products (estimated at 3 million tons on the 1st September) which represented lubricating oils is not known and cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy. The initial reserve may be^considerable if Germany has learnt the lessons of the last war. Ludendorffemphasised the importance of lubricants in the last war and that the lack of themcaused grave difficulties.Apart from drawing on reserves, the balance must be made up by increased production from hydrogenation and vegetable sources, reconditioning of oldoil, &amp;c. It is estimated that after a year&apos;s organisation the products fromsynthetic production would not be increased by more than 100,000 tons.7. As regards regeneration of old oil, the following extract from the german press of 1937 is of interest, as it shows that even then difficulties of supply wereanticipated : &quot; Regeneration of old oils is being intensified. Consumption for thepresent year of lubricant oils is 460,000-470,000 tons of lubricants, asagainst 272,000 tons in 1933. National production, including regeneratedoils, was 45,000 in 1933, and 100,000-125,000 tons in 1937. The majorityof this is new oil, but the proportion from regenerating plant is notnegligible, in view of the hundred or so plants now in operation. Nostatistics of oil recovered are, however, available.&quot; Garage, pump and repair stations are being obliged to collect wasteoil where this exceeds 50 kilog. per month, and the same applies to industrial and agricultural establishments using more than 50 kilog. of lubricant per month. The yield is passed to the regenerative plants. Forty-two of thelatter plants undertake unlimited recovery of oil; the rest work for private persons against a fee.&quot;According to the records of one of the oil companies, the actual amountrecovered in 1938 was only 18,000 tons, but it is known that the process has been greatly extended since then. A statement from a French source, which in other respects of the problem appears to be well informed, is to the effect that the recovery of used oils may be of the order of 33 per cent., and other expert opinionconsulted holds that this may not be an excessive estimate. The use of suchrecovered oil is, however, not regarded as safe for high-speed engines. Even if germany recovers so much as 200,000 tons, she has not yet made up her currentneeds (apart from stocks), which would explain the reports of her search in alldirections for this class of oil.
APPENDIX V.Note on Germany&apos;s Position as regards Gas and Diesel Oils.THE total requirements of gas and diesel oil for 1938 amount to about1,770,000 tons, including 115,000 tons consumed in Austria, Czechoslovakia and poland. As regards the requirements of the old Reich, 1,655,000 tons, no lessthan 1,467,000 tons was imported from the following sources.thousand tons.U.S.A....................      549-3Dutch West IndiesMexico, Peru   ...IranU.S.S.R.RoumaniaOthers486-8184-611944-2 (210-6 in 1937)64-7 (106-7 in 1937)181,466-62. The bulk of this consumption, which has increased nearly four-fold since1932, was required for civil transport and industrial purposes, the requirementsof the armed forces amounting to about 135,000 tons only.3. Internal production in 1938 was on a very small scale. True indigenousproduction (apart from production from imported materials) amounted to no more than 120,000 tons, and it is estimated that the local production of syntheticgas oil is not likely to exceed 250,000 tons at the most in the first year of the war.4. Imports will now be severely restricted to Roumanian and Russiansources. In 1938 the supplies from Roumanian sources, including requirementsof Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland, amounted to about 180,000 tons. Thetotal production of gas and diesel oil in Roumania for the current year is estimated as follows :  Tons.Production and stocks ...       ...       ...       ...      715,000Inland consumption and bunkers take ...      165,000Available for export ...       ...       ...      ...       ...      550,000Normally, the Balkans, Levant, Italy, &amp;c, would absorb about 239,000 tons, but itcannot be assumed that this normal trade will continue as before. It is apparent that, from Roumania, the Greater Germany might be able to increase her pre-war supply of 220,000 tons in 1937 and 180,000 tons in 1938. To what extent shewill demand this class of oil within her recently-decided quota is difficult toestimate, but perhaps a figure of 300,000 tons may be assumed for the present purpose.From Russia importations were 210,000 tons in 1937 and 44,000 tons in 1938.In the present year it is expected that about 40,000 tons will be delivered by russia under the particular contract to supply a total of 100,000 tons of petroleum products. It has been assumed, as regards the second six months of&quot; the war,that total supplies from Russia, Estonia, &amp;c, will vary from 250,000 tons to500,000 tons. If Germany, as is probable, will require a large proportion of gasoil as in the first contract, she may get 100.000 tons to 200,000 tons in the secondsix months, or 140,000 to 240,000 tons for the whole of the first year of the war.5. The proportion of the stocks, amounting to 3 million tons at the beginningof the war. which fall under the category of gas and diesel oils is not known, andit is difficult to frame any reliable estimate.
6. In respect of civil consumption, it is estimated that Germany, in viewof the restrictions on imports of these oils and of her limited production, willemploy the most drastic measures to economise in consumption of gas and dieseloil by transport vehicles and stationary industrial engines. In the former casejourneys will be restricted and vehicles converted to other forms of power, suchas producer gas, and the economies effected are estimated to produce at least a50 per cent, saving in the use of these oils. In the case of industrial use(including tractors for agricultural purposes) it is probable that savings effected by conversion may be counterbalanced by increased requirements for munitions and general industrial purposes.On these assumptions it seems probable that the civil requirements of gasand diesel oil would be reduced to about 1 million tons.7. The result of these estimates is as follows, for the first year of thewar :  Consumption Armed forces     ............ 270,000 to 375,000 tons.Civil       ...............      1,100,0001,370,000 to 1,475,000 tons.Resources (apart from stocks) Imports............... 440.000Domestic production    ...       ...      ... 250,000690,000The higher figures of consumption relate to a condition of static warfare for six months and active for the rest of the year; the lower figures relate to a staticcondition for the whole year. The figures show that Germany&apos;s position is verydifficult in respect of these oils, and that she will be driven at all costs to increase her imports from Russia and Roumania, to develop her internal production andto devise further economies. As regards the former, it may be possible toimmobilise part of the surplus in Roumania to prevent supply to Germany; asregards the second, the expert view is that Germany will find it difficult toincrease her internal production to any material extent in the first year, though in 1941 it is probable that she will have greatly improved her position as new works come into operation and transport from Russia, &amp;c, has been reorganised.
