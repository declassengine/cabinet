THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT       &apos; ^ ^TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AMD KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.W.P.(40)  118 COPY no, .:   ffi/(Also paper No.O.O.S.( p^ 979( S) c4TH APRIL.  1940. mR 0ABIMBTiPOLICY REGARDING- FORCES FOR SCANDINAVIA,REPORT BY the chidfs of staff committee,1. The War Cabinet will recall that prior to theabandonment of the expedition to Finland and Scandinaviawe had ready for despatch,  in addition to forces &quot;Avonmouth&quot;and &quot;Stratford&quot;, a force of two divisions to be followed,if necessary, by a third division known as force &quot;Plymouth&quot;,This force was to operate in Southern Sweden if thatcountry were attached by Germany,  and it formed part ofthe price which we were prepared to pay for securing theco-operation of Sweden.2&quot; In our recent report to the War Cabinet on possible German re-actions to our operations in norwegian territorial waters and the precautionary and counter measureawhich we should be prepared to takes we stated -&quot;Germany will certainly bring pressure to bearon Sweden to increase the output of Iron ore from Baltic ports, to make herself independent&apos;of Narvik.    if she fails to obtain Swedishco-operation she might seize the Grangesburgarea now, and the Galivarc area as soon as the ice melts&quot;.3* As a counter measure to the above action byGermany we expressed the following view :-&quot;There is no. immediate action which we can take to prevent the Germans occupying Sov-thernSweden.        If they should do so, however, we might be called upon to go to the assistance ofthe Swedes.    In that event a force comparable to that which was to have gone there under theprevious scheme would be necessary.    there constitution of such a force is being studied.We do not, however, believe that Germany wouldinvade Sweden except as a last resort, partic-particularly as this would present us with anx   W.P. (LO)llo;  also C .0.S, (h,0)269(S)

opportunity of going to Galivareo     We,therefore, do not consider that it would,he justifiable, at this stage, seriouslyto weaken our capacity for dealing withcontingencies which are probable 0 o i. o..in order to guard against a contingencywhich is clearly remote..114. As a result of further study we adhere to theviews expressed above and now that the weather isimproving we think it quite as likely that Germany wouldembark upon an offensive on the Western Front as she would be to make any very large detachment of her mainforces for major operations in Sweden.5o For the above reasons we propose that our policy for maintaining forces in readiness for operations in scandinavia over and above those which are already availablefor despatch to the Norw-belgian ports, should be as follows-: -(a) Ho alteration should be made in the existing programme for despatch of additional forces to France, subject to the following conditions.Ob) Base and L0   of C.  establishments should beprepared to enable a force of approximately two divisions, with an appropriate air forcecontingent,  to be assembled and despatched to Scandinavia should events render this step necessary.      Owing to the lack oftraining and equipment of the forces now inthe United Kingdom these divisions and aCorps H. Q. would have to be withdrawn fromthe B.E0F0,  should they be required forScandinavia.(c) &apos;The remainder of the 49th division should bemobilised and held in readiness to be sentin to reinforce the three battalions ear-marked for Narvik and/or the five battalionsearmarked for Southern Norwegian ports.(d) A small holding of shipping for the transportof E. T0  to Scandinavia might be necessary.6. We ask the War Cabinet for authority to plan inaccordance with the above policy.(Signed)    C.L.N.
