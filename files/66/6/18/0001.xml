For this reason, and becausethey were not  -hopeful of being able to accept the Soviettermsj, the Finnish Government considered, first, that itwould be necessary for them to postpone their appeal for allied assistance until, at the latest, the 12th March, and,secondly, that it was of the greatest importance that theAllied preparations for intervention should continue.2. I replied that we had been preparing to inform theFinnish Government by telegraph that from our point of view it was vital that they should define their position at theearliest possible moment.     Indeed we had hoped that theymight be able to do so within 24 hours of the receipt of ourmessage,.     We considered that there were three possibilities.The Finnish Government, with full knowledge of the position,might appeal to the Allies to despatch an armed force totheir assistance, and to the Swedish and Norwegian

Governments to allow this force to cross their territory..Secondly, in view of the serious obstacles to the despatchof such a force they might appeal for the greatest measureof help available in the circumstances..     This wou.&quot;,d, inpractice, mean an appeal for the despatch of war material,and in particular of bombing aircrafto     Thirdly, theFinnish Government might announce their intention of negotiating with the Soviet Government, in which case thequestion of the despatch of war material by the allies would clearly assume a different shapee3. I then ashed Mo Gripenberg whether, in view ofthe message which he had just delivered, it would be unreasonable to ask the Finnish Government to make up their minds as we had originally proposed.4o The Minister replied that in his opinion it would notbe. unreasonable to do so, provided that we did not insist on receiving a repTiy within a few hours.     We must remember that the Finnish Government, who were onlyhuman, had undergone a great dealo     They were physicallytired and suffering from the shock of continual air raids, as well as from the anxiety caused by the criticalmilitary situation.      They were subjected to considerable pressure by the Swedish Government who were threateningto recall their volunteers, and to withdraw the consider-able measure of material assistance which they had hitherto   afforded to Finlands      It was however possiblethat the exhaustion and depression from which theFinnish Government were suffering would passo      In thecircumstances M. Gripenberg begged His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to give them a few days in which to consider their position.

5.       I replied that we should naturally take all thxsinto consideration.     At the same time, however, it wasunderstandable that His Majesty&apos;s Government, who wereperfectly ready either to proceed with the proposed schemefor an expedition or alternatively might be willing tohelp   Finland by supplying aircraft, should want to know where they stood.6. M. Gripehberg next asked whether we should be ableto fly out immediately the bombers which we were ready toprovideo      It was of the utmost urgency for the finnish government to have aircraft with which to bomb the Soviettroop concentrations on the Isthmus.     Even 20 or  0 wouldbe of great value *      I undertook to discuss this matter with the Prime Minister and to let M. Gripenberg have an answer as soon as possible.7.       Before leaving me the Minister asked what replyhe was to return to his Government.      I suggested that heshould inform them that he had delivered their message,which was receiving urgent consideration from His majesty&apos;s government, and that a reply would be sent as soon aspossible.(Initialled) H.Foreign Office, S.W..1.7th March, 1940.
