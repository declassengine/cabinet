naval  SITUATION.General Review.AN unusual feature this week has been the successful attack on german merchant shipping off the Danish coasts by British submarines.No air attacks on shipping have been reported. The total loss of merchantshipping for the week is less than it has been for any week since the beginningof the year.Home Waters.2. A strong force from the Home Fleet has been cruising in northern waters to provide support for the Norwegian Convoys and the Northern Patrol.On the 22nd and 23rd March a sweep into the Skagerrak was carried outby light forces, with the object of intercepting German merchant shipping. Nonewas met with by these forces. Some success was achieved by our submarinesworking in these waters, details of which are given in paragraph 15 of this resume, and the consequent interruption of the flow of German merchantshipping may account, in part, for the lack of success by our light forces.3. Following indications of the presence of a U-boat in the Swithaentrance to Scapa Flow, a section of the observation mines was fired during theearly hours of the 22nd March. Subsequent examination by divers, however,failed to establish that a submarine had been there.Early on the 22nd March H.M. Trawler Loch Assater swept up three mines in her trawl, to the north-eastward of Kinnaird Head. The third of themexploded and the trawler sank. The crew was rescued, but the Skipper and twohands were wounded. It is probable that these mines came from a deep minefieldof our own in this area.Three French submarines have arrived at Harwich to co-operate with our submarines in the North Sea.4. On the 27th March a report was received from Oslo that a german submarine had grounded off Mandal, South Norway, and had refloated later with one engine damaged. British submarines on patrol were informed and an airsearch was arranged on the 28th; subsequently information was received thatthe submarine (U. 21) had been interned by the Norwegians.Foreign Waters.5. On the 22nd March, as has been reported in the Press, the S.S. QueenMary and Mauretama left New York for Australia, proceeding by differenti-outes.German Intelligence.6. The pocket battleship Lutzow (ex.-Deutschland) and tanker Nordmarkare reported to have left Gdynia for a North Sea port at the end of February,\and to have sailed for commerce raiding duties during the first week in March.U-boat operations have been confined almost entirely to the East and west of the Orkneys and Shetlands. At the time of going to press two or three seemto be working in this vicinity and off the Moray Firth, and one in the western approaches.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. A search of the area to the West of the Orkneys and Shetlands wascarried out on the 25th and 26th by destroyers in co-operation with extensiveair patrols.Altogether six attacks have been carried out during the week, three by aircraft and three by surface craft, without definite result. One of these attacks,carried out in the Bristol Channel on the afternoon of the 25th by H.M. TrawlersKirkella and Bandolero, gave promise of success but investigations carried outsince have failed to produce confirmation.
Protection of Seaborne Trade.8. A total of 1,040 ships, of which 40 were Allied and 290 Neutral, havebeen convoyed during the week without loss by enemy action. Included in this number are three ocean convoys; one from Sierra Leone, one from Halifax, andone from Gibraltar. Two convoys consisting of 81 ships, of which 20 were british, have arrived from Norway, and two of 45 ships have sailed to Norway.Forty-five destroyers (including five French), 20 escort vessels, 4 cruisers,4 armed merchant cruisers, 3 battleships and 4 submarines (including threeFrench) have been employed in escort duties.9. Since the commencement of hostilities the total number of ships convoyedhas been : Of these 25 British, 1 Allied and 2 Neutral have been lost, or approximately in 525.During the week ending 23rd March imports in ships sailing in convoywere well up to the average, except for cereals which totalled 76,154 tons ascompared with the unusually higlTfigure of 236,256 tons of the previous week.Thirty-one tankers brought 311,256 tons of oil, of which 43,800 tons were for french ports. Food imports were 129,581 tons, which is an increase of 6,000 tonson the previous week.  Minerals and ores totalled 185,923 tons.The effect of arming trawlers is now becoming apparent. Recent accountsby the masters of vessels attacked show that the German planes if resolutelyengaged sheer off.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.10. Five ships, totalling 15,219 tons, have been sunk during the week under review. This total compares favourably with that of previous weeks.The ships, which consisted of one British (5,742 tons) and four Neutrals (9,477tons), all fell victims to submarines.Details of these attacks, as well as further reports recently received of attacks by aircraft carried out on the 20th and 21st March, are given inAppendix I.No attacks by surface vessels or by aircraft have been reported during theweek under review, nor are any ships known to have been mined.11. S.S. Domala (8,441 tons), which was beached after being attacked by aircraft off the Isle of Wight on the 2nd March and set on fire (as reported inWeekly Resume No. 27), has now been docked at Southampton.It is now known that the Dutch Trawler Protinus (202 tons) was sunk by enemy aircraft on the 20th March, her crew being rescued by H.M. SubmarineUnity after six days adrift in an open boat.German Minelaying.12. No definite intelligence of German minelaying has been received. Onthe 22nd March H.M. Trawler William Wesney reported that Heinkel machines had dropped two parachutes to the westward of the Rough Buoy outside Harwich.Skids have, however, searched this area without result.A green parachute was seen by an observer corps dropping 5 miles NW. ofDungeness but it was not seen to enter the water.   No aircraft was seen.A reliable report has been received that a small type of mine, showing8-10 inches out of the water, has been sighted in large numbers over a wide area, roughly 70 miles N. by E. of Ostend.British Minesweeping.13. The sketch at the end of the Resume shows the extensive system ofsearched channels whidh are searched daily if the weather allows.Apart from this normal routine sweeping, the main sweeping effort hasbeen between the Downs and the Dutch coast.   On the 21st March a searchedBritishAllied ...Neutral14,713[21041]b 2
channel was instituted between the North Goodwin-and Wandelaar Buoy (N.N.E.of Ostend). Minesweeping operations have been carried out daily, when weatherpermitted, in this area. Thirty-one moored mines were cut in the week, makinga total of forty-two in all. It has hot been considered advisable to allow traffic touse this channel yet: the French have now taken over the eastern part of it.In the vicinity of the Humber four mines were cut. The inshore channelto Flamborough Head has been swept by Oropesa sweep, but will need to bemagnetically swept before it is brought into use again;.;14. Eight magnetic mines were intentionally exploded in known dangerousareas during the week. Six of these were exploded east of the Tongue light vessel,and one in the Sunk Area. The other mine was exploded by a skid in theFahnouth approach.A large number of explosions were reported on the 25th March in the thames Estuary, off Southwold, and off the Humber. It has been suggested thatthese mines were fired by very intense magnetic storms and the Astronomer Royalis investigating this possibility.German Merchant Shipping.15. On the night of the 21st/22nd March, S.S. Heddernheim (4,947 tons)was intercepted 8 miles East of the Skaw by H.M. Submarine Ursula. Afterthe crew were safe in their boats, in flat calm weather, the ship was torpedoed.Two nights later H.M. Submarine Truant intercepted the S.S. EdmundHugo Stinnes (2,129 tons). She was outside Danish territorial waters, butentered them while under gunfire, where she appeared to be scuttled and abandoned, so was finished off by a torpedo. The master was taken prisoner byTruant.A report that the S.S. Ostpreussen (3,030 tons) was fast aground to the south-westward of Hirshals Light (near the Skaw) is confirmed by H.M. SubmarineTriad, which wras ordered to investigate.S.S. Antonio Delfino (13,589 tons), which left Bahia, Brazil, on the21st February, has passed through Norwegian waters, escorted by a Norwegianwarship during the week.   She left Haugesund on the forenoon of the 28th.16. The Narvik iron-ore traffic has been almost closed down during thecurrent week. Since the 20th March only two German ships have arrived there and two have left. The Norwegian national holiday, which lasted from the21st-27th March with the exception of half a day, will no doubt partly, but not entirely, account for this lack of arrivals. There has been, however, a certainamount of traffic to some Scandinavian ports, especially small ships in the herring trade.Economic Warfare.17. During the week ending the 23rd March, 2,030 tons of goods destined for Germany have been seized in prize. The main item is 1,065 tons of fats,oils and waxes, of which 665 tons.came from American ships. There were alsoseized 148 tons of base metals, 376 tons of food products, 193 tons of textiles and 149 tons of rubber.During the same week the Contraband Committee considered the cargoes of 85 ships which have arrived since the 16th March, and 40 outstanding cargoesfrom the previous week. In 50 cases entire cargoes were released either on first consideration or after enquiries. During the week, under the systemwhereby advance copies of manifests of cargoes are received and considered beforethe ships&apos; arrival, 52 cases were dealt with, and in 25 cases ships were released bythe Committee subject merely to the formal checking of the original manifestspn the ship&apos;s arrival at the control bases. On the 26th March there were 24neutral ships in the Contraband Control Bases in the United Kingdom, of which9 had been there for three days or less,
MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.18. There has only been local activity, during the weet German raids on allied posts have on every occasion been repulsed, and prisoners captured byBritish and French.The B.E.F. has started to take over a further portion of the front, and isextending its left to include Bailleul. This extension of the flank will becompleted by the 30th March. Headquarters III Corps and certain Corps troops are now in France, and the move of the 44th Division to France began on the27th March.Germany.Troop Movements.19. Reports received during the week show considerable activity oppositethe Luxemburg, Belgian and Dutch frontiers up to the second week in March;there is, however, little to indicate that it represents more than the frequent reliefsand interchanges which appear to be the present policy, and normal training andmanoeuvres.That there are no additional concentrations in the West is to some extentconfirmed by the reported lack of railway activity in Central Germany. Improvedweather conditions and the freeing of waterways indicates that railway con-acstion should now be overcome.Communications.20.   Bridging activity over the Saar, Sure, Mosel and Rhine is noticeable.The Rhine is now being used for cargoes of all kinds, and river gun-boats,with A.A. guns and searchlights, have made their appearance.The railway system in German Poland has been re-established, and nowprovides adequate communication between Germany and all the occupied territories; on the other hand, the communications with Soviet Russia and roumania do not appear capable, as yet, of transporting troops or supplies on alarge scale.Distribution.21.   The distribution of German divisions is now believed to be as follows : --	Cav.	Armd.	Lt.	Mot.*	Inf.	Total.Western Theatre  ... Central Germany ... Baltic   Coast, including Corridor   and East Prussia ...           ...       ... Poland, excluding Corridor Bohemia-Moravia... Austria      ...       ...       ...       ... Slovakia	1 1	7 1	3 1	7	88/104 7/23 8 18 5 6	106/122 7/23 8 19 6 7	2	8	4	&apos; 7&quot;: ...	148	169* Including three S.S. and police divisions.Italy.22. According to press reports, the Army Bill published last week providesfor a total of 67 divisions of all types. This reveals little change since january 1939, some four months previous to the military pact with Germany.There are actually 56 metropolitan infantry divisions, excluding Blaekshirt andnative divisions.Italian East A frica.23. Since the end of the rains last October the Italians have been trying to complete the pacification of the more important rebel areas, notably to thenorth and south of Lake Tana, and in the area south of Lake Margherita.
Operations were first undertaken against the rebel chief Mangascia in theGoggiam but he eluded ail attempts at capture, and after punitive action these operations were abandoned. In December the Italians assembled forces to dealwith disaffection near Gardulla, south of Lake Margherita, and have since beenable to restore order there. In November three rebel chiefs in the area north of Lake Tana agreed on concerted action, but after some initially successfulraids the alliance was apparently dissolved; and by February the Italians hadthe rebel movement under control and were employing their troops on roadmaking.From early January extensive operations ensued in the Goggiam, whererebel activity continues. The scene of the strongest rebel resistance was the areasome 50 miles south of Lake Tana, but despite several small rebel successes theItalians have been making progress, capturing numbers of rifles and receivingmany submissions. It is doubtful whether the Italians will be able to complete the pacification of the Goggiam before the commencement of the rains in May;but the other areas of rebel activity appear, if only temporarily, to be quiet. Inthe Ancober region (north-west of Addis Ababa), Abebe Aragai had beenobserving a truce with the Italians and his formal submission was apparentlyimminent, when an incident between his followers and the Italians led to renewedhostilities.The prospects of further rebel activity, after the usual desultory actionduring the rainy season between May and October, are to some extent dependenton a good harvest for the rebels and the supply of arms and ammunition whichis believed to be running short.Iran.24. It is now confirmed that the Iranian Army is to be further expanded bythe addition of two infantry divisions, making a total of 17 infantry divisions and 3 cavalry divisions.Although a further 20,000 men were recently called to the colours, only thetwo Teheran divisions are up to strength and six at little more than half strength;the remainder each represent a brigade or less.Far Bast.25. Apart from reports of some fighting within 30 miles of Peking andthe withdraAval of Japanese troops from territory adjacent to Portuguese Macao,there have been few operations in China.Among the Chinese forces, Chiang Kai-Shek has exerted his influence tosmooth out differences between certain followers of the Central Government andthe ex-Red 8th Route Army. The last-named, in turn, are reported to be trying to settle discontent among the troops of Yen Hsi-shan, Governor of Shansi, somesix battalions of his army being under the surveillance of the 8th Route Army.On the other hand, clashes between Communist and Central Government troops are reported from Hopei province.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.Reconnaissances to Establish Results of Sylt Raid.26.   Daylight reconnaissances were again despatched on the 22nd, 23rd and&apos; ,   27th March, but weather conditions made observation and photography difficult.\   Of two aircraft sent out on the 27th March, one failed to return and is believedi  to have been shot down by a formation of three Messerschmitt 109&apos;s which were seen to attack it.   The other aircraft flew at high speed past the seaplane bases at Hornum and List, at distances of 1 and 3 miles respectively; no specialevidence was seen of substantial damage to the main structures.   Photographs,however, revealed that the landing stage at the end of the small pier at HornumI   had disappeared.   They also showed one vessel in harbour with a large craneI   amidships; probably a merchant vessel converted for catapult use.   Seaplanes\ were observed moving on the runways and taking off, and a train was seen
crossing the Hindenburg Dam. The aircraft also saw thirteen enemy fightersin the air, and was attacked from astern by three of them, which it evadedsuccessfully in cloud.Offensive Patrols and Reconnaissances.27. Daylight reconnaissances in search of warships and other targets inthe Bight were flown on the 24th, 25th, 27th and 28th IVJarch, and there werevarious encounters without decisive result. Eight aircraft were despatched onthe 24th March, in unfavourable conditions of low cloud. One of them flew lowover the entrance to the Kiel Canal at Brunsbuttel and was heavily attacked with small-arm and pom-pom fire from the shore and from four merchant vessels;four bombs were dropped and the fire returned by our aircraft without observedsuccess. Another aircraft, on the same day, engaged two Flak ships. an operation of the same type by nine aircraft on the 25th March was broken off onaccount of fog. In the early afternoon of the 27th March three aircraft out ofa flight of five, which were acting independently of one another, sighted fourGerman destroyers some 40 miles North-West of Borkum, attacked them, and reported the position to their base. The target was moving at high speed, and,in spite of extensive search by fourteen further aircraft sent out to the positiongiven, it was not possible to re-establish contact. The other two of the originalfive aircraft encountered and attacked two Flak ships and six patrol vessels, but without obtaining a direct hit.On the 28th six aircraft, flying in formation, took off to attack warships in the Bight. Owing to lack of cloud cover no attacks were made. On thesame morning nine Blenheims carried out a reconnaissance of this area.Numerous vessels, including light warships, were observed near Borkum andSouth of Sylt, and a submarine was seen 60 miles North-West of Terschelling.Night Reconnaissances and Security Patrols.28. Patrols over the enemy seaplane bases were maintained only on thenights 24th/25th, 25th/26th and 27th/28th March, involving eight aircraft inall, and nothing of special interest was observed, except for a single balloon flyingover Borkum. There were, however, extensive reconnaissance flights over thewhole area of North-Western Germany, on every night except that of the26th March, when weather conditions were particularly unfavourable. Abouteighty aircraft in all were engaged, and some 5 million leaflets were dropped.One aircraft failed to return on the night of the 23rd March, and the GermancTsam. that it was shot down by anti-aii&quot;craft fire is probably correct. The lossof another aircraft on the 25th March was probably not due to enemy action, as its position was plotted to within 40 miles of the English coast on its return.Two aircraft failed to return from reconnaissances on the night of the 27th.One is reported to have been shot down by Dutch fighters, four of the crew beingsaved. The Germans claim to have shot the other down by anti-aircraft fire andto have captured the crew. Enemy aircraft were seen on the 22nd and24th March, and one of them, apparently a Messerschmitt 110, attempted to make an attack, which was evaded. The black-out was good, apart from the glare ofblast-furnaces, and anti-aircraft fire was on occasion intense and accurate. Aballoon barrage was seen in position at Wilhelmshaven on the 23rd March, at,000 feet, and it is believed that there is also a barrage at Dtisseldorf.Fighter Command.29. Enemy activity has been very slight throughout the week, apart fromthe usual North Sea reconnaissance by single aircraft, but 607 patrols involving1,288 aircraft were flown.On 28th a Heinkel was intercepted and destroyed by Hurricanes 15 miles east of Wick.Coastal Command.30. Forty-two routine and 115 special patrols were flown during the week,and fifty-three convoy escorts, involving 234 aircraft sorties, were provided.The only definite submarine sightings were on 22nd March, when duringthe morning an Anson aircraft succeeded in stalking a submarine through cloud
ssome thirty-seven miles North-North-East of Cape Wrath, and dropped twobombs from five hundred feet close to the point where it submerged. Later inthe day a second Anson sighted a submarine in the same area and dived on it out of the evening sun. The attack was withheld until the aeroplane was at200-300 feet above the sea, and two bombs were released which appeared to strike the submarine but did not explode, possibly because of the low altitude fromwhich they were dropped. Suspicious indications were seen and bombed NorthWest of the Shetlands on 23rd March, and off Northern Ireland on the 25th,but it is not certain that submarines were in fact present. Special anti-submarine patrols were provided on 25th and 26th March in the Bristol Channel, after a submarine had been reported there by coastal watchers, but nothing of interest was seen. Four mines were sighted in the Channel on 23rd and 25th March by aircraft on escort duty with leave-boats, and were marked and reported.31. Long-distance patrols were maintained into the Skagerrak and along the Norwegian coast, and four German merchant vessels were sighted, three ofthem in Norwegian territorial waters. In a similar reconnaissance on 27th Marchby three aircraft to the neighbourhood of Horn Reefs eight Flak ships were seen, and there were two separate encounters. On the first occasion our aircraftcircled at 1,000 feet over two Flak ships and a minesweeper, and when firewas opened, attacked one of them with four 250-lb. bombs. The first of these was seen to explode ten yards from the vessel attacked; the other bursts were not seen, as our aircraft went into cloud. About half-an-hour later four ships were seen by another aircraft not far off, and opened fire; as our aircraft took cover,it dropped three bombs very close to one ship, including one probable direct hit.When it emerged from cloud three miles away some five minutes later, only three ships were visible on the surface, and there was a patch of white and disturbedwater which appeared to mark the position of the fourth.British Air Forces in France.32. Fifty patrols were flown by fighters of the Air Component, involvingeighty-eight aircraft sorties, and the Army Co-operation squadrons continuedoperational and training flights over French territory. One long-distance nightreconnaissance was flown successfully on the 24th March, when road and railmovements were under observation in the Aachen-Koln-Duisburg area, and someleaflets were dropped.33. Activity in the Advanced Striking Force area was much more intenseduring the week; twenty-eight fighter patrols were flown and there were severalcombats. On the 22nd March, five Hurricanes, while patrolling near the frontier in co-operation with French fighters, intercepted about six Messerschmitt 109&apos;sat 25,000 feet, and it is believed that one^-onemy-aircraft was shot down, without loss to ourselves. On the morning of fhe 26th March, a formation of about fiveDornier 17&apos;s was seen at 23,000 feet near Metz, escorted by threeMesserschmitt 110&apos;s flying behind and above the bombers: a patrol of twoHurricanes attacked the Dorniers and were in turn attacked by the enemy fighters, and after an inconclusive engagement, in which our aircraft exhaustedtheir ammunition, the Germans broke up their formation and turned eastwards.Another patrol was sent up while the combat was in progress and interceptedthe Dorniers on their way home. One Dornier 17 was seen to emit smokeand lose height with both engines running slowly and subsequently came downnear Maucourt. Another Hurricane of the same section had an inconclusivecomb^&apos;t^whih&quot;&quot;a&apos; Messerschmitt 110, and a further patrol of two Hurricanes thenjoined the battle, without further success.34. In the afternoon a patrol of nine Messerschmitt 109&apos;s was seen flying in open formation at 24,000 feet over Bouzenville by a section of three Hurricanes,which split up and attacked the outlying members of the formation. Four ofthem rolled over when attacked, and dived towards the ground, possibly damaged,a xTa&quot;&quot;fif th&quot; was seen&quot; to&apos;&apos;&quot;gg3S5?S^iiLfl?&apos;mes- The pilot who attacked it was in turn attacked from astern : the roof of his cockpit was blown away by a shotfrom a cannon-gun, he was wounded in the leg, and the aircraft caught fire,but he succeeded in jumping clear and landing practically unhurt between the
front lines. Almost simultaneously, another formation of twelve Messer-schmitt 109&apos;s was intercepted in the same area, and two. of them were shot down m a climbing attack by the leader of a section of Hurricanes.35. Combined leaflet and reconnaissance raids were carried out nightlyfrom the 21st to 25th March over the Rhine area. Twenty-one aircraft in all were employed and 132,500 leaflets were dropped. There was no opposition by enemy aircraft, and anti-aircraft fire was comparatively weak.Intelligence.German Air Force.36. The German aircraft which was forced down in Denmark on the16th March on its return from the Scapa raid lias proved to be a Junkers 88the new type of German bomber.   It has been examined, and photographed.37. There are now indications that the peace-time German organisation ofthe Air Force into five Luftflotten (Air Fleets) has been discontinued as unlikely to be of much service under war conditions. Present organisation is probablyinto five Air Army Corps, each of two divisions, and there are, in addition, three separate Air Army Corps, which include the coastal and naval air units, theparachutists and air infantry, and the training division.38. Photographs secured in the autumn of 1939 showed that at certainaerodromes aircraft were dispersed singly and protected only by roofless shieldingwalls arranged in funnel-shape and open at both ends. From more recent photo-graphs, it appears that these have been, in some instances, replaced by miniaturehangars of a more permanent type. Thirty-three of these were seen on oneaerodrome, and about twenty-five on another. It is believed that this form ofprotection is in part a temporary measure, to preserve aircraft which would otherwise be parked in the open and might suffer damage in winter conditions;but it may also serve as camouflage and as a protection by dispersal againstbombing attack.French Air Activity.39. A number of reconnaissance flights have been made over the region of.Zweibrucken-Pirmasens, and the valleys of the Saar, the Moselle and the Blies,as well as in the neighbourhood of Basle and north, and east of Fribourg. nothing of interest was noted, except that new anti-tank works are apparently nearing completion east of Besch (about 4 miles north of Apach). A reconnaissance duringthe night of the 24th-25th March along a route Saarbrucken-Coblenz-Euskirchenand back along the German-Dutch and German-Belgian frontier observed noactivity.Italy.40. It has now been officially announced by the Under-Secretary of Statefor Air that squadron establishments are being increased by one-third; this will bring bomber squadrons up to eight aircraft, and fighter squadrons up to twelve.Three new Stormi (groups) are being formed, one of which is to be a fighterStormo and will be stationed at Trapani in North-Western Sicily.41. Work has now been finished on barracks for 200 airmen onPantelleria, and it is known that an aerodrome and seaplane base have beencompleted, although no unit is yet stationed there. Considerable activity has alsobeen reported from Rhodes during the last two months, and it is believed that several Air Headquarters&apos; Staffs, as well as the Cadres of several air units,arrived during January. Normal flying training continues in Libya, and thereare no reports showing any special increase in activity.Russia.42.   The Russians had at one time intended to introduce the American&quot; Vultee &quot; type into service as a long-distance bomber-reconnaissance aircraft,but it is understood that, owing to production difficulties, the plan was dropped,[21041] c
and those already constructed were to be diverted to civil purposes. It istherefore interesting to note that aircraft of this type were being reconverted formilitary operations in Finland, presumably because of a shortage of suitable long-distance aircraft in the Soviet Air Force.Northern Europe.43. Siveden. The existing Air Force of five flotillas is to be increased byan additional four flotillas.  These will be made up as follows : (a) Two additional fighter flotillas, each of three squadrons. The presentequipment of Gladiators is to be replaced by Seversky and Vulteefighters, and 144 of these two types have been ordered.(&amp;) An additional light bomber flotilla is being formed, which is to be equipped with Northrop dive-bombers now being manufacturedunder licence in Sweden. The existing light bomber flotilla is to berearmed with the same type.(c) An additional heavy bomber flotilla is to be formed, but the type of aircraft to be used has not yet been decided.44. Norway. The Norwegian Government has purchased in the U.S.A.twenty-four Curtiss fighters for the Military Air Service, and twenty-fourNorthrop dive-bombers for the Naval Air Service. Delivery has begun and isexpected to be completed shortly.Eastern Europe.45. Bulgaria. The Air Force is at present equipped with a.heterogeneouscollection of aircraft, and maintenance presents particular difficulty. There isa marked shortage of the necessary tools and urgent demands have been placed with firms in Essen and Vienna. A small Air Mission left Sofia for Berlin onthe 11th March to negotiate for their supply.46. Hungary. It is reported that a party of German Air Force officersrecently arrived in Budapest, to serve as instructors to the Hungarian Air Force.This development seems to follow naturally on reports of the recent visit of aHungarian Purchasing Mission to Vienna, and of the acquisition of Germanmachines.47. Jugoslavia. Ten out of sixty Messerschmitt 109&apos;s, ordered fromGermany, have been received, and have made the total number of this type in service with the Jugoslavian Air Force up to fifty. The twenty short-nosedBlenheims recently handed over in England have all arrived in Jugoslaviawithout mishap, and it is understood that they will be used to re-equip two squadrons. It is believed that between thirty and fifty Caproni fighters havebeen ordered in Italy.Civil Aviation.48. An Italian Service was inaugurated from Rome to Locarno on the18th March; and a service will be inaugurated on the 1st April next by&quot; Swissair&quot; between Loca,rno and Barcelona, with three-engined Douglasaircraft accommodating twenty passengers. The route will be over Italy, but without landing in that country. From the same date, the German Lufthansawill operate a new line from Berlin to Stavanger, via Copenhagen, Gothenburg,Oslo, to be extended later to Bergen. A service between Brussels and Copenhagenwill be opened by the Belgian Air Lines.49. It is known that Germany has now made an official application forthe renewal of the permission granted to the Lufthansa to operate a service fromGermany to Portugal, which had lapsed on the outbreak of war. The portuguese government has asked for further details as to the proposed service, which havenot yet been given. The Portuguese Government has granted the Spanish AirLines permission to operate a Madrid-Lisbon service and permission has beengiven fey the Spanish Government for the operation of a London-Lisbon airservice, crossing Spanish territory.
