INSTRUCTIONS TO HIS MAJESTY&apos;S SHIPS REGARDING attacks on ENEMY WAR VESSELS IN NEUTRAL territorial waters.Copy No.   24Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 25th November last the War Cabinet (War Cabinet 94 (39),Conclusion 3) considered the action to be taken by the fleet in the event of the pocket battleship Deuischland, which had just sunk H.M.S. Rawalpindi, being found by the fleet in Norwegian territorial waters, or taking refuge in thosewaters in the course of action with British forces. It was decided that, if shewas so found, she should be attacked; and the Admiralty were authorised to issue orders to this effect.2. I am not sure, however, whether the Cabinet appreciate fully the implications of the orders then issued, although the Altmark incident has a bearing on their application. Under these orders the fleet acted then and arestill acting on the understanding that if any enemy surface war vessels takerefuge in, or are found inside, territorial waters of Norway, Faroes or Iceland,they are to be attacked except when this would endanger life in towns or villages.The instructions add that endeavour should be made to engage the vessel beforeshe enters territorial waters, so that the action might be represented as the continuation of gement or pursuit already begun on the high seas.German vessels are not to be attacked in territorial waters near a neutral port.Similar instructions have been issued by the Air Ministry to the Commander-in-&quot; Chief, Coastal Command.3. The Foreign Office have written to the Admiralty, on my instructions,pointing out that the existing orders to the fleet would appear to go beyond theCabinet decision in that they extend the permission to attack German ships in territorial waters to vessels other than the Deutschland and to waters other thanNorwegian. The Admiralty have replied expressing their desire to maintainthe orders, and, indeed, to extend them to enemy submarines in addition to surfacevessels, on the ground of the general German disregard for the rules of war andof their violation of Norwegian territorial waters by sinking three merchantvessels within them.4. In all the circumstances I would advocate that the instructions alreadyissued should be maintained and extended to enemy submarines as suggested bythe Admiralty; but that there should be no jxiblic pronouncement of HisMajesty&apos;s Governments intentions in this matter.   In the event of action being;10962   [21079]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1940.SECRET.W.P.

ttaken in virtue of these instructions, it would have to be justified by referenceto the complete disregard for all the rules of warfare shown, by the GermanGovernment.5..; I feel, however, that since the point was originally raised in the:Oahine^and since the Admiralty&apos;s instructions may be held not to correspond to theconclusion then reached, my colleagues should have an opportunity of confirmingthe standing instructions which have been issued, and of approving theirextension to enemy submarines.Foreign Office, April 4, 1940.
