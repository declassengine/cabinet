Chiefs. o f.....Stsff pomraittee.in our Report on the Implications of intervention in Scandinavia (W.P.(40)  35), which was considered by theWar Cabinet at their meeting on 2nd February,s we pointedout that Germany could bring an overwhelming scale of air attack on the Scandinavian cities, particularly in southern sweden, and that the air defences of Norway and Sweden weretotally inadequate to meet such attack,.      In thesecircumstances the Scandinavian Governments would be likelyto ask us for categorical assurances of substantial assistance,     VVe could not provide direct assistance on any effective scale owing to lack of operational facilities in southern Sweden and Norway,,     We therefore suggested thatit might be necessary to declare in advance that if Germany&quot;took the gloves off&quot; and initiated bombing in Scandinaviathat led to destruction of civilian life and property, as she did in Poland, we should immediately, retaliate on germany.20 This possibility was mooted by the prime Ministerat the 5th Meeting of the Supreme War Council when he pointed out to the French representatives that, while he did not wish to commit himself at the time, it was an issue which would probably have to be faced.3.. At the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 16thFebruary, 1940,^ reference ,was again made to this question,but no conclusion was reached other than that any decision which the War Cabinet might take on this matter would need to be agreed with the French Government,4, Events are now moving quickly.      The approach hasbeen made to the Scandinavian Governments, and we may be confronted at any moment by a demand for specificassurances.      But the French will be sure to view thepossibility of unrestricted air warfare with the greatestconcern and a considerable time may be taken up in discussions with them      It therefore seems to us imperative that this issue should now be faced by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment without further delay,K W.Mo(40) 31st Conclusions, Minute 1.W,M0(40) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 1,-1-

50 Accordingly we ask that the Yifar Cabinet should consider as a matter of urgency, the following points:-(i)(ii)If the Scandinavian Governments so demand,should we give them an assurance that air attack on their civilian population orcities would be regained by us as on a parwith air attack on the population of thiscountry or on London, and as calling forimmediate retaliation in the shape of allied air attacks on objectives in Germany?If the answer to (i) is in the affirmative:, andbearing in mind the fact that such an assurance would be of no deterrent valueunless known to Germany, should the factthat we have given this assurance be made known publicly at   a suitable moment whenthe Scandinavian Governments have agreed toour intervention)?(Signed)      C.
