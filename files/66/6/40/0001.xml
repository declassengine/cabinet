(40) 110.March 26, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN connection with the Meeting of the Supreme War Council on the28th March, I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum prepared in the ForeignOffice on South-Eastern Europe.H.Foreign Office, March 26, 1940.SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE.AS a result of the Finnish-Soviet Settlement and the apparent stalemate onthe Western Front, we can be certain that the view will be taken in many quartersthat the German flank must be turned by means of action elsewhere. Moreover,as we know, stalemate on the west affects the French position and morale morethan our own : in addition, inaction has a depressing effect on the neutrals.Paris, therefore, will be searching for some way out of the deadlock, and theireyes will naturally turn, now that Scandinavia is out of the question, to other possible fields of military action, and South-Eastern Europe will certainly be oneof their suggestions.The problem to be considered has, of course, a double aspect, and the strategic and political considerations are closely interwoven. Politically the situation maybe resumed as follows : The French, after some hesitation, subscribed to theproposals for the formation of a neutral bloc in the Balkans, and the Allieshave together pursued such a policy not without success. Neither of thedissatisfied countries, Hungary or Bulgaria, has joined our enemies; and aftersix months of war all these countries are convinced that Germany will not win.They are not, however, yet convinced that the Allies will do so, and the effectof the Finnish-Soviet settlement will be to increase their doubts. It will, in thenext few months, and in the absence of military victories on our part, be difficultenough to maintain the ground already gained. If we were to sustain what might be interpreted as a military iwerse such, for instance, as a german attack on Holland and the occupation by Germany of Dutch ports and aerodromes our prestige will probably, but perhaps only temporarily, decline. We mustfurther remember that the main object of these countries is to remain out of10948   [21084]
the war and at the same tim,e retain their independence. No other considerations are of comparable importance to them. Only in Hungary and Bulgaria are there other aims of importance, namely, a determination somehow to turn thesituation provided by the European war to their advantage, e.g., by the realisation of their territorial ambitions.In these circumstances the Allies will, from the political point of view,&apos; gain nothing, but will, on the contrary, lose a great deal, if they, of their initiative, bring the war to South-Eastern Europe unless and this, of course, isthe crucial point their military action in the Balkans can be overwhelminglyeffective and decisive. If we could bring such overwhelming force to bear we might well see the wavering neutrals all crowding to our side in an endeavourto gain some merit by joining the winners, and perhaps even from genuinefeelings of hatred of German domination and exploitation and relief at theprospect of the early extinction of this spectre. If, however, our military actionI is indecisive we are in danger of losing all sympathy in South-Eastern Europe,for we are inviting a German occupation.Strategically the situation remains as ever, namely, that any action we might contemplate in South-Eastern Europe is dependent upon the benevolentneutrality of Italy, almost certainly the-^active support of Turkey and theconcurrence at least of Greece. Italian neutrality has not yet been assured, andseems, in the last few days, to have even receded. It is, of course, possiblethat when the Allies are much more powerful than they are to-day they mightbe prepared to take the risk of a less than benevolently neutral Italy : for theymight feel that if Italy should declare her hostility she could be dealt withswiftly and decisively; but those conditions are not yet present and any actionin South-Eastern, Europe must continue to be conditioned by the attitude of Italy.As to Turkey, her attitude is sound, but up to the present we have no reasonto suppose that she will fight unless she considers her vital interests to be inclanger. As to Greece, she might well be prepared to play her part if calledupon to do so, but is anxious to be provided with the arms which will makeher own contribution effective. In point of fact, Greece&apos;s attitude would probablybe determined by her estimate of the chances of an early and decisive victoryby the Allies.i Summing up, therefore, it would appear that from both the strategical andpolitical angles it is not to our interest to intervene as yet in South-Eastern Europe.The overriding considerations must be our strength and the effectiveness of our intervention when decided upon.For some time past it has appeared to be Germany&apos;s policy to stabilise theposition in the Balkans, although of course she has been by no means unwilling to stage scares as and when it has suited her main purpose. Leaving on one side Germany&apos;s obvious interest in preventing Russia from extending her influencealong the littoral of the Black Sea to the Straits, Germany&apos;s main concern inthe Balkans continues to be the supplies she draws from those countries. Solong as the war in the west remains static the supplies she receives from thesecountries are probably adequate to her needs, particularly in oil. If she wereto attack in the west and to use great quantities of oil, the position might be different, but it is difficult to suppose that she would be able to attack both inthe west and to invade Roumania at the same time. Nor is there any reasonto suppose that she would find it necessary to do so. Germany in collusionwith Russia, and possibly making use of Bulgaria, has ways and means of bringing pressure to bear on Roumania which have not yet been put into practice,and it is difficult to believe that she would not find it possible to lift moreoil from Roumania than the 130,000 tons a month to which she is at presententitled. To do so she would probably have to send technicians into roumania and perhaps reorganise the transport system.It is perhaps this consideration which has largely been responsible for plans of which reports have already appeared in the press, now supplemented byinformation received from secret sources, to the effect that Germany, Italy and russia are contemplating a joint guarantee of the Balkan States -Roumania tobe the first recipient. Such a plan would have many tactical advantages fromthe point of view of the three guarantor countries. It supplies, to the advantageof Germany, a basis for collaboration between Italy and Russia which is other-wise difficult to find; it permits the Duce, to his own advantage, to allow his
countrymen to infer that Italian participation in war is less likely, while Italianinfluence in the Balkans has increased; while, for Russia, such a plan woulddecrease the hostility hitherto shown her by Italy. Moreover, it can be dressedup with a view to impressing neutral opinion. As for the countries who would receive this guarantee, it is doubtful whether any undertaking given by Germany,Russia and Italy to-day would be regarded with other than the gravest suspicion,but they might argue that beggars cannot be choosers, and might be ready toaccept the very limited security offered.From our point of view such a joint guarantee, e.g., to Roumania would be tantamount not only to a diplomatic defeat, but might also, if Roumania acceptedthe virtual status of a German province w ith all its consequences, go a long way towards defeating our blockade policy. It is, however, extremely difficult tosuggest any means whereby the rejection of such a guarantee can be ensured.It may be said that there are only four factors working on our side in South-Eastern Europe. They are : first and foremost our own military and air strength;secondly, Turkey; thirdly, the undoubted goodwill of the Balkan peoples incontradistinction to the policies of their Governments; and, fourthly, Germandefects, e.g., their tactlessness and their tendency to bluster and be overbearing.The last factor is out of our control. The third is in the last resort conditionedentirely by the first, namely, our strength. That strength is not yet apparent, andthe QJiiv-xeaLcarcl in. our hands at the momenths Turkey. The question in essenceresolves itself into whether it is possible for us so to devise our policy as to getTurkey into closer relations with Roumania and possibly Yugoslavia and Bulgaria(with Greece she is already intimately allied), and thus form a bridge and arallying point between the Allies on the one hand, and the Balkan States on theother. The success of this policy again depends upon the military and air strengthof the Allies. So long as Roumania, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria feel that they willbe overrun by Germany before the French and the English can come effectively to their aid, so long are they likely to accept guarantees from Germany, Italyand Russia. Nor on any showing at present are we likely to get the Turks to advance upon the position already indicated in this paper, viz., that they willfight if they consider their vital interests are in danger but not before. It seems doubtful, therefore, whether there is any diplomatic action we can take inSouth-Eastern Europe designed to counter such a triple guarantee as is discussedabove.Foreign Office, March 28, 1940.
