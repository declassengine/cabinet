(40) 26l(S).Sffl MARCH,  1940.COPY HO,    7&quot;l--Vi/AR CABINET eASSISTANCE TO PUT:&apos;. ND,Report by the^Chiefs of Staff......CpminitteecIn accordance with the conclusion reached by theWar Cabinet at their meetiag* yesterday, we invitedBrigadier Ling to our meeting today and consulted him asto the form of help which Finland particularly required.2.       Brigadier Ling was emphatic that the crying need,above all else was for 50 bombers, with British pilots andBritish ground organisation..     He said that the Russiancommunications with Leningrad presented most wonderfultargets to air attack, and that apart from the materialeffect of this reinforcement, it would hearten the hard-pressed Finns, and in addition give Sweden an outwardand visible sign of our strength, and possibly make hermore amenable to giving passage to our expedition.5,       The delivery of 50 bombers, complete with crews,to Finland at the present time has military complicationsof a grave character.     We have therefore thought it right to set out our views at some lengths* W,M.(40) 6lst Meeting, Minute 5,Confidential Annex,

4. The fundamental military object, of our-oo^igijiaiplan was the denial of Swedish ore to-Germany.    rfhepossibility of achieving&apos; this- ob-ject alone led us to advise the acceptance of the&apos; risk of war with Rub8la5 the militarydangers inherent in the&apos;plan-for assistance to Sweden, and an appreciable weakening of our forces in France *rid GreatBritain.      Our arrangements, for carrying ovtthe plan inits entirety are complete;    but before we can do so,we require first an appeal for help from Finland, and secondly the co-operation of Norway and Sweden.5. There are,  broadly speaking, two conditions underwhich the 50 bombers might be supplied, namely(a) as a bargain in exchange for an appeal by Finland;    or,(b) merely as a means of sustaining Finnish resistance,without any conditions.6. As regards (a) an appeal from Finland is an essentialpre-requisite to our whole plan.    Upon it hangs our onlychance of getting passage through Norway and Sweden andthus achieving our primary military object.    If the Finnsdo not appeal, we stand to lose an opportunity, which maynot recur f    of wresting the initiative from Germany and ofdepriving her of a vital raw material.    If, therefore,  aFinnish appeal can be secured,  by the immediate delivery of 50 bombers, we should be prepared to pay this price jdespite the fact that it will appreciably increasethe extent of the risks  ( -,G originnlly contemplated )  tobe taken at home nnd in France,Note.    Since our original Resort.\/.p. (39)3.79^4 Blenheims have already been delivered&quot;to finland.      The delivery of a further 50 wouldmean that the risk &apos;it home and in France hadbeen increased to the extent of 74 bombingaircraft.

7- It is of course possible thr.t in spite of theFinnish appeal; Norway and. Sweden might fail to co-operate.In this case, though a landing at Narvik could probablybe made, even, if necessary, in the face of opposition, weare of the opinion that Swedish and Norwegian co-operation is essential if we sire to have any chance of forestallingthe Germans in the Galivare-Lulea area.8. Ae regards paragraph 5(b),  if we should&apos; supply 50bombers merely in order to -sustain the Finnish&apos; resistance-,we&apos;&apos;  politicalshould derive, not on jy a certain/advantage   from our generosity,but also the military advantage  that Russian resources would not be available to Germany for so long as finnish resistance lasted.    Moreover,  the longer the Finns resist,the weaker Russia will become, and the less damage willshe be able to do to British interests in other parts ofthe world.    It is to be noted, hoxvever,  that these militaryadvantages may be short-lived, since once the Gulf ofBothnia is ice-free, the Germans will have it in their power &quot;to stab the Finns in the back&quot;and thus bring the warin Finland to an end.    They will certainly do this ifthey think it is to their advantage;    and Field marshal mannerheim definitely fears it.9. On a consideration of the above arguments, wereach the following conclusions:- -(i)  If the delivery of the 50 bombers isconditional on a formal appeal by Finland tothe Allies, and if in the judgment of the FarCabinet, there Is a reasonable chance that this appeal will lead to the co-operation of norway and Sweden - either before the expedition

starts, or at least when it lands - and soto the attainment of the primary object ofthe expedition,  then the delivery of the bombers would be justified from the miliarypoint of view,(ii) If, however, the bombers are to be handed overunconditionally, purely with the object ofsustaining the Finnish resistance for what maywell be a strictly limited period (see paragraph above) we-consider that the military risks of denuding the Home Front and lessening thesupport which we are able to provide for theBritish Expeditionary Force in France,outweigh the military advantages that arelikely to accrue.(Signed)   C.L.N.
