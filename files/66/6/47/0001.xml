Special arrangements have been made for obtainingfrom Scandinavia, the earliest possible authenticinformation of a German move against Norway or Sweden.We have been informed of the details of these arrangements and are satisfied that they should prove adequate.RECEIPT OP INFORMATION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.3. As soon as a report of any German move againstNorway or Sweden is received in this country^ the information will be sent immediately to the Foreign Office, the service departments and the War Cabinet Offices.     arrangements have been made whereby the source from which theinformation is obtained, will be included in these reports in order that their reliability may be estimated.DECISION TO DESPATCH THE EXPEDITION.4. No arrangement has, however, yet been made for obtaining a decision to despatch the expedition.      Inthis connection the following considerations have to beborne in mind:-(i) Time is all important, and therefore a speedydecision to despatch the expedition isessentialo

(ii) The first news received, of a German move againstScandinavia will very possibly be vague and .unconfirmed, and mangrhours may elapse beforefull confirmation can be obtained,(iii) No irrevocable step has been taken, until theships actually arrive at the Norwegian portscThey can be recalled, at any moment during the periodof at out 20 hours which will elapse between  their sailing from the United Kingdom and their arrival offXT o i? ws. y* $8. In the light of these considerations, we recommendthat the following procedure should be adopted:-(i) Service Departments should   be empowered, withoutfurther reference to the War Cabinet, to set in motion the despatch of the expeditionimmediately on receipt of the first news of aGerman move against Scandinavia, even if theinformation is unconfirmed,(ii) In order to ensure that the action of service departments, is uniform and s imultaneous, theresponsibility for the decision to move shouldbe vested in the Admiralty as being the predominant partner in the first phase,(iii) When this decision is taken, the Admiralty willbe responsible for informing the War cabinet secretariat, by whom an immediate report willbe made to members of the War Cabinet, unlessthe &quot;order to go&quot; is issued between 10.0 p.m.and 8.0 a.m. the next morning, in which caseMinisters will be Informed at the latter hour,(iv) In the light of any further information receivedafter the arrival of the first news referredto in (i) above, but before the expeditionarrives off the Norwegian ports, the War cabinet will be able to decide whether the expedition isto proceed or be recalled,.(Signed)    C.L.N.
