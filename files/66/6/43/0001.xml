(40) 99)MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARIn accordance with the promise I made in paragraph 2 of my memorandum .P. (40) 99 of 18th March, 1940, I circulate herewith, for the information of mycolleagues, the revised draft instructions for the Commander-in-Chief of theBritish Expeditionary Force in France. They are now in a form which meetsthe views of the Secretary of State for Air and the Commander-in-Chief.,28th March, 1940. - ,      \Instructions for the Commander-in-Chief, British Expeditionary Force1. The r61e of the force which His Majesty&apos;s Government have sent toFrance and the command of which they have entrusted to you is to co-operate with our Allies in the defeat of our common enemy.\ :.. 2. His Majcsty&apos;s Government having placed the British Expeditionary force under the French Commander-in-Chief (Commandant-emChef des ForcesTerrestres) have agreed that he may delegate its command to the Commandant-en-Chef sur le Front du Nord-Est who will be, in these circumstances, yourimmediate superior. In the pursuit of the common object, the defeat of theenemy, you will carry out loyally any instructions issued by him. At the sametime, if any order given by him appears to you to imperil the British Expe-ditionary F^orce, it is agreed between the British and French Governments thatyou should be at liberty to appeal to the British Government before executingthat order. Whilst it is hoped that the need for such an appeal will seldom, ifever, arise you will not hesitate to avail yourself of your right to make it, if you think fitShould command of the British Expeditionary Force be delegated to the commandant-en-Chef sur le Front du Nord-Est, it has been agreed that you should nevertheless have direct access to the Commandant-en-Chef des ForcesTerrestres at your discretion.3. It is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to keep the British forces under your command, as far as possible, together. If at any time the french high Command finds it essential for any reason to transfer any portion of theBritish troops to an area other than that in which your main force is operating,it should be distinctly understood that this is only a temporary arrangement.4. The French General Staff have undertaken to assist in the provisionof air defences at the ports of disembarkation. They have also agreed tomaintain their own air observation system in the area in which the british expeditionary Force may be operating and to give warning of air attack tothe formations and installations of that Force through the medium of theexisting French air alarm system.O.F.G.S.
5. The Air Component of the British Expeditionary Force, although ithas j5e.en absorbed, into the command of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,British Air Forces in France, remains as heretofore under the immediatecommand of an Air Officer Commanding, who will continue to act as air adviser to the Cbmmander-in-Chief, British Expeditionary Force andi under his opefa-tional control.. The Advanced Air Striking Force, which is also operating from french territory, is under the direct command of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, British Air Forces in France. The War Office has, nevertheless, under-taken the maintenance of this Force from the common bases up to railheadand for this you, as Commandef-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force,will be responsible. You are not, however, responsible for the protection ofthe aerodromes and railheads of the Advanced Air Striking Force. But should situation arise which would make it necessary for you to assume responsibilityfor protection of this Force, you will receive instructions from the War Office.6. It is realized that you may require air co-operation beyond the resourcesof the Royal Air Force Component of the British Expeditionary Force.Additional support may be necessary for the general protection of your force against hostile air attack, for offensive air action in furtherance of militaryoperations, or to establish local air superiority at certain times. Arrangementsfor the provision of such support will be made by you in consultation with theAir Officer Commanding-in-Chief, British Air Forces in France, who is chargedwith the responsibility of seeing that you have, at all times, full assurancesregarding air support.7. The instructions, approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government, to govern theconduct of all forms of bombardment are attached as an annex. You will bekept informed of any modification of these instructions which may from timeto time be authorized.8. You will be kept informed, from time to time, of the reserves of equipment and ammunition which are available for your operations. You will appreciate the need for due economy of your resources, both in man power and in material.In the latter category a strict control over the expenditure of petrol must been forced, ...... &apos;.      - - --. 9. You will keep up constant communication with the War Office andreport regularly as to the situation. In exercising the command to which you have been appointed you may rely with absolute confidence on receiving thefull and unqualified support of the Government, of.the Army Council, andof the British People.
ANNEX.   ,Instructions by His Majesty&apos;s Government to Govern the Conduct of all Forms :of Bombardment.I. The following instructions will govern the conduct of all forms of bombardment: until therestrictions therein contained are modified.These restrictions, in the meantime, are not to be relaxed on any account pending further instructions, even in retaliation for indiscriminate action by an enemy.2. The object of the instructions is not to define legitimate military objectives, but to lay down a course of action in accordance with the agreed policy, which it may be expedient to adopt at the outset of war. It will be observed that the effect will be to restrict bombardment more severelythan is required by a reasonable interpretation of existing international law.3. Only the following &quot; purely military objectives in the narrowest sense of the word &quot; maybe bombarded from the sea or air. Army Commanders will conform generally to the spirit of these instructions:  (a) Naval forces, i.e., warships, auxiliaries actually attendant on the Fleet, naval dockyards,barracks and other establishments manned by naval personnel.(b) Army units, fortifications, coast defence works, barracks, camps, billets, depots, dumps,and other establishments manned by military personnel.(c) Air units, military aerodromes, depots, storage units, bomb stores and other establishmentsmanned by air personnel.(d) Troop transports (whether at sea or in harbour), roads, canals, and railways used formilitary communications, military road and inland water transport.Trains, road and inland water transport are not to be attacked&apos; unless they can reasonably be presumed to be of a military character.(e) Accumulations of Navy, Army or Air Force stores.   (This does not authorize attack onfactories.)(/) Naval, Army and Air Force fuel -installations or dumps in the field or situated within theconfines of the Naval, Army and Air Force establishments mentioned in sub-paragraphs(a) to (c) above.(Note. Bulk stocks of fuel, not covered by the above definition, are not to bebombarded under these instructions.)4. Action against objectives in paragraph 3 above will be subject to the following general principles: -(a) The intentional bombardment of civil populations is illegal.(b) It must be possible to distinguish and identify the objectives in question.(c) Bombardment must be carried out in such a way that there is reasonable expectation that damage will be confined to the objective and that civilian populations in the neighbour-hood are not bombarded through negligence.Thus it is clearly illegal to bombard a populated area in the hope of hitting a legitimate target which is known to be in the area, but which cannot be precisely locatedand identified.5. Subject to the general policy set out above, Commanders must exercise their discretion,and orders for bombardment should be framed according to the spirit of that policy and notnecessarily to the letter. In particular it must be borne in mind that the fact of an objective beingunquestionably military does not necessarily or invariably justify bombardment of it. Thus an anti-aircraft or coast defence gun situated in the centre of a populous area could not be bombardedwith reasonable expectation that damage would be confined to it. A small detachment of troops inbillets in, or a convoy of transport passing through a town, or a troop transport lying alongside acommercial wharf, are unquestionably military objectives, but the bombardment of such objectives in a town might involve risks to the civil population out of all proportion to the military importanceof the target at the time and might thus be unjustifiable. Justification for bombardment even ofunquestionably military objectives must, therefore, depend upon circumstances and must be decided by Commanders acting in the spirit of these instructions.6. The necessary action is being taken to secure the adherence of our prospective allies to thispolicy, and the necessary communications are being made to the Governments of the Dominionsand of India!7. Later, it may be desirable to extend the scope of these instructions to the full extentallowed for by the following:  , .Naval Bombardment.. Hague Convention No. IX of 1907.Air Force Bombardment. The Draft Hague Rules of Aerial Warfare, 1922/23, as interpreted in Air Ministry instructions to be issued in the near future.Until such times as further instructions are issued from London, however, the above will stand.They are, however, liable to be modified at the shortest notice.8. The action of armies is well established by practice and is not in dispute. Commanders ofmilitary forces on the ground will use every reasonable precaution to avoid undue loss of civilianlife by artillery bombardment.(B40/8)   60   3/40   W.O.P.   4941
