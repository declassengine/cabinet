(40) 107, I circulate to my colleagues the text of the aide-memoire, which was communicated to the French Embassy onthe 27th March in accordance with the decision reached at to-day&apos;s meeting of theWar Cabinet (WM. (40), 76th Conclusions, Minute 5).H.Foreign Office, March 27, 1940.Aide-memoire communicated to the French Embassy.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have studied with much sympathy the views expressed by the French Ambassador in his aide-memoire of the 15th instant.His Majesty&apos;s Government agree with the French Government that the Soviet-Finnish Treaty of Peace is being represented as a grave check to the allied cause and may be interpreted by neutral Powers as evidence of lack of energyon the part of Great Britain and France. His Majesty&apos;s Government fully recognise that they understand to be the main preoccupation of the FrenchGovernment, that immediate and vigorous action on the part of our two Govern-ments is necessary in order to reassert the authority of our two countries andto check the tendency of the neutral States to submit in increasing measure to german influence and dictation.2. There are clearly various measures which our two Governments can )take in order to achieve these results. The French Government have suggestedthat the proper course in the present instance would be that the AlliedGovernments should proceed to establish their naval control in norwegian territorial waters, and, if necesasry. to complete this control by the occupationof strategic points on Norwegian territory. It is true that in considering actionof this character the Allies need no longer take into account the effect that it (would have upon the Finnish problem, but His Majesty&apos;s Government still holdthat action of such a drastic and spectacular character could only be justifiedif the objectives to be attained thereby are commensurate with the criticism which such action would arouse in other neutral countries, particularly the&quot; United10944   [21031]Copy No. 3 4
States, and with the counter-action which Germany may be expected to take inretaliation. The French aide-memoire suggests that the objectives which theAllies would have in view would be to put an end to violations by Germany of norwegian territorial waters, and at the same time to intercept Swedish iron-oredestined for Germany.3. It is doubtful however, whether the cases where Germany has violatedNorwegian territorial waters are sufficiently numerous, well-authenticated, and recent, to justify the retaliatory action proposed by the French Government. Onthe other hand,- the interception of cargoes of German iron ore passing from narvik to Germany through Norwegian territorial waters would in itself producebut limited effect at this period of the year. During the winter months whenthe Gulf of Bothnia is frozen by far the larger amount of iron ore shipped toGermany might have been stopped by this means; but, with the advent of springand the melting of the ice in the Gulf of Bothnia, shipments from Lulea will soon be resumed and the German Government, if unable to continue shipments from Narvik, would no doubt take effective measures to ensure that they obtainedall their requirements of iron ore from Lulea, and other JBaltic ports, through which it would be possible to route the whole of this traffic. If so, the control by the Allies of Norwegian territorial waters would have produced smallinterference with Germany&apos;s imports of this vital commodity. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are, however, fully alive to the necessity of continuing to examineother methods of interfering with German supplies of iron ore and they aredevoting close study to this problem at the present time.4. Although His Majesty&apos;s Government regret that they cannot thereforeshare the view of the French Government as to the efficacy of the course ofaction advocated by the latter, they are as deeply impressed as are the FrenchGovernment with the importance of reasserting their authority in neutral countries, and more particularly in Sweden and Norway. As far as these twoGovernments are concerned this will require that the Allies should readjusttheir policy, which hitherto has been based on the assumption that Sweden and norway are free agents capable and ready to exercise benevolent neutralitytowards the Allies. Now that their subservience to German influence and pressurehas been clearly shown, the Allied Governments will be compelled in self-defence to take special precautions to protect their vital interests and requirements in sweden and Norway. His Majesty&apos;s Government would propose that this changeof policy should be brought home in a formal manner to the Swedish and norwegian Governments, and in their opinion the most suitable way of doing so would be for the two Allied Governments to make a communication to these twoGovernments on the following lines.5. The events of the last three months have shown that, irrespective ofthe wishes and sjanpathies of the Swedish and Norwegian peoples, the GermanGovernment are resolved as far as possible to deprive the Norwegian and swedish governments of that liberty of action in foreign affairs to which they are entitled.The British and French Governments sympathise with tJhe difficult position inwhich the two Scandinavian Governments are placed as a result of German threatsand pressure. But while deploring this state of affairs they are bound to drawtherefrom the inevitable conclusion that since the two Scandinavian governments are not, in present circumstances, entirely free agents, they may at any time be urged, under German pressure, to modify their foreign policy in ways whichwould seriously prejudice the interests of the Allied Governments. Apart fromthe actual policy which the Norwegian and Swedish Governments may be compelled to follow, it must also be realised that a situation may at any timeemerge in which the Allied Governments could no longer afford to acquiesce in the present state of affairs whereby Germany draws from Sweden and Norwayresources vital for her prosecution of the war and enjoys facilities in Sweden and norway which place the Allies at a dangerous disadvantage.6. The Allied Governments feel therefore that the time has come to notify the Swedish and Norwegian Governments frankly and formally of certain vital interests and requirements which they intend to defend and assert by whatevermeasures they think necessary. If the successful prosecution.of the war requires that such measures should be taken by the Allies, the latter would urge in
justification of their action that the principles for which they are fightingcorrespond with those which the Scandinavian peoples and Governments would themselves wish to see prevail, and that the rights, and indeed the independence,of the smaller States of Europe can only be secured by the victory of the allied cause. The British and French Governments feel confident that this point ofview will be duly appreciated in Norway and Sweden. The rights of thesetwo countries, indeed, are already being violated by the German Governmentwhenever they feel that they can do so with impunity. For example, their shipping and that of other neutral countries is attacked and destroyed almostdaily by German submarines, mines and aircraft in defiance of internationallaw and with loss of life; and the Governments concerned are unable to secure any redress.7. The vital interests and requirements which the Allied Governmentsaccordingly wish to bring to the notice of the Norwegian and Swedish Govern-ments are the following : (a) The Allied Governments cannot acquiesce in any further attack onFinland by either the Soviet Government or the German Government.In the event, therefore, of such an attack taking place, any refusalby the Swedish and Norwegian Governments to facilitate the efforts of the Allied Governments to come to the assistance of Finland in whatever manner they think fit, and still more any attempt to prevent such assistance, would be considered by them as endangering theirvital interests.(b) Any exclusive political agreement which Sweden and Norway may enterinto with Germany would be considered by the Allied Governments asan unfriendly act, even though it ostensibly was intended for thedefence of Finland. Any Scandinavian alliance which provided forthe acceptance of aid from Germany, and which thus brought the scandinavian countries into special political relationship withGermany, would be considered by us as directed against ourselves.(c) Any attempt by the Soviet Union to obtain from Norway a footing onthe Atlantic seaboard would be contrary to the vital interests of theAllied Governments.(d) The Allied Governments would have to take appropriate measures tosafeguard their interests if the Swedish and Norwegian governments were to refuse, withdraw, or curtail facilities in matters of commerce and shipping which the Allied Governments consider essential for the prosecution of the war, and which it is not unreasonable for the twoScandinavian Governments to concede.(e) Further, seeing that the Allies are waging their war for aims which areas much in the interest of the small States as in their own, the Alliescannot allow the course of the war to be influenced against them byadvantages derived by Germany from Sweden and Norway. they therefore give notice that they reserve the right to take such measures as they may think necessary to hinder or prevent Germany fromobtaining in Sweden and Norway resources or facilities which for thepurpose of the war would be to her advantage or to the disadvantage of the Allies.8. The formal communication of such a list of what the Allied Govern-ments consider to be their vital interests and requirements in respect of scandinavia should in itself produce a salutary effect on the scandinavian government, and would prepare in advance conditions such as would enablethe Allied Governments, should they so desire, at a suitable moment to proceedto direct action, on the ground that they were doing so in defence precisely ofthose interests and requirements which they had duly formulated.9. Meanwhile, no announcement should be made of the dispersal of the expeditionary force which it had been intended to send to Finland, in orderthat the impression may be generally given that this force is being kept in being and that the Allies are in a position to protect their interests in Scandinaviaat a moment&apos;s notice.10. Such is the rough outline of the policy which might be applied to sweden and Norway, and His Majesty&apos;s Government would recommend it to
the careful consideration of the French Government. Flis Majesty&apos;s Governmentrealise that this policy needs more study, both in regard to its details and its implications, inasmuch as it departs fundamentally from that hitherto followedby the Allied Governments. They would accordingly propose that the forth-coming Supreme War Council should examine the whole matter in all its aspects,and formulate the scope of the policy to be adopted and the exact procedurenecessary to give it full effect.11. His Majesty&apos;s Government are, however, convinced that vigorous actionagainst neutral States, whatever form it takes, will remain ineffective unlessthe Allies also take direct action against Germany herself. They would like,therefore, the French Government to give further consideration to the proposalfor the laying of fluvial mines in German waterways which was put before theFrench Government on the 9th March.12. His Majesty&apos;s Government attach great importance to this operation,and they have been informed that the French General Staff share their view asto the favourable results to be expected of it. His Majesty&apos;s Government are convinced that delay may prejudice the success of the whole operation. the stores and personnel are ready and the scale on which it is proposed to start theoperation is a large one and can be sustained. There is thus no danger ofcompromising success by acting prematurely with insufficient resources. weather conditions are suitable, but may not remain so. Furthermore, with every day&apos;sdelay, the likelihood is increased that the Germans will learn of the plan and take measures to frustrate it. As regards the fear of retaliation, it must be recognisedthat the Germans are likely to retaliate in the event of any offensive action onthe part of the Allies. Nevertheless, in this particular case it appears to HisMajesty&apos;s Government that the risk of retaliation is not so great as to justifythe grave disadvantages involved in the postponement of the plan. The Germanscannot retaliate by means of hand-sown mines and it is believed that they mayhave no suitable apparatus ready for sowing mines by air in French waterways.Moreover, the dropping of mines by air into narrow waterways is an exceedingly difficult and hazardous undertaking. Finally, His Majesty&apos;s Government do notbelieve that the Germans are likely to retaliate by initiating unrestricted airwarfare, for the reason that they have hitherto deliberately refrained from thispolicy, not because they have been seeking an excuse, for they required none to bomb Polish villages and British trawlers and lightships, but because they donot think it is in their interest to do so.13. His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that the French Government on further reflexion will be ready to agree to immediate action on these lines, andthey would hope that they might receive the French Government&apos;s reply to this effect at the forthcoming meeting of the Supreme War Council, for they feel strongly that, if the pressure that it is proposed to exercise in the two Scandinavian-scandinavian capitals is to have its full effect, it ought to be preceded by the direct action which they desire to take in Germany. It goes without saying that anearly decision as regards the laying of fluvial mines would not preclude discussion at the Supreme Council of other forms of action against Germany. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would welcome such discussion.Foreign Office, March 27, 1940.
