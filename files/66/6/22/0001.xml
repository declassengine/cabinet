TRANSLATION,Note communicated by the French ambassador to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, 10th March,  1940n.The President of the Council has studied the reply which His Majesty&apos;s. Principal Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs returned to the message transmitted to Lord Halifax0n 5th March through His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Paris..Lord Halifax pointed out in the conclusion of this reply that,  if the Scandinavian Governments announced their decision to oppose passive resistance to the passage ofAllied troops,  questions of French and British prestige would demand that the two Governments should abandon the plan foran expedition rather than expose it to the risk of not being able to leave Norwegian ports.It cannot be denied that the likelihood of an appeal from the Government at Helsingfors seems more problematicaltoday..     None the less,  the French Government consider thatthe Finnish Government could be brought to address this appealto us if the negotiations initiated at Moscow receive a set-back.      However that may be, France and Great Britain should remain ready to reply to it by the affirmation of the mostrapid and most effective assistance and to draw from itthemselves the maximum of advantage.The French Government,  in the desire to obviate anyhesitation at the critical moment in the adoption of a commonattitude,  think It necessary te make plain their views on the eventuality to which allusion is made in the note sent byLord Halifax to M. Daladier on 7th March^1* If the Government of Helsingfors decide to reject the demands of the Soviet Government, it is certain that their decision would be in large measure based on the prospect

of the assistance promised by France and Great Britain, who have emphasised its extent and rapiditye    The Allies have already engaged their moral responsibility too far to allow them toconsider that a simple refusal by ITorway and Sweden to their demand for right of passage would, free them from theobligation to send their forces at least as far as Norwegianports, with a view to bringing to bear on the scandinavian countries the extra pressure which would result from the physical presence of their troops02. If they were to abandon their project to send militaryforces as a result of a negative reply from Oslo and Stockholm,the Allies would be withdrawing from the undertaking which theyassumed towards Finland that they alone would determine theconditions of their immediate assistance.      Nothing would bemore likely to reinforce the present attitude of Sweden and norway than the certainty that this would be the consequenceof a simple diplomatic refusal on their part.      german propaganda would take the opportunity of denouncing the lack ofsincerity and of energy on the part of France and Great Britain.It would be easy to describe their earlier action as being thatof two Powers who, convinced in advance that the bcandinaviancountries would refuse.se the right of passage to their troops, andhaving taken the decision not to ignore this refusal, wereoccupying themselves, without running any risk, in encouraging .the   Finns in their resistance by promising them help whichthey knew they could not give-3* In law as in fact,  the attitude assumed by theAllies towards Finland during these last weeks could only bejustified if they execute their promise right up to the point at which an absolute and proved impossibility prevented itscomplete realisation,,      Moreover it is not impossible that,-2-

after allowing the Swedish Government %o confront us with a refusal which our passivity might appear to justifys Swedishpublic opinion might be roused against positive measures taken to stop us.4. It should also be remarked that, faced with anaccomplished fact, the Swedish and Norwegian Governments? who could not hope   that the expeditionary force would, be re-embarkedonce it landed in Scandinavia., would have every advantage in facilitating its passage to Finland in order to diminish the burdens and risks of every kind which the presence ofconsiderable forces on their territories or at their frontiersmight involve for them.      It would be possible for the Swedishand Norwegian Governments to plead at Berlin9 and at Moscowsforce majeure, and they would doubtless seek to limit allied occupation of their territory to small bodies who would becharged with the provisioning and the security of the communica-tions of the Franco-British forces engaged in Finland.5. Finallys  and this argument is in the opinion of theFrench Government decisive9 the Finnish Government&apos;s appeal would perhaps offer the last chance of proceeding to theoccupation of Norwegian ports of which the controls, evenif the expeditionary force could &quot;not temporarily leave them.,would present for the Allies in the general strategy of the war,an importance which it is unnecessary to emphasise.      Controlof the North Sea would be assured more completely for them.The shipment of Swedish iron ore along the Norwegian coastwould be completely suppressed.     From Narvik to the scandinavian ore fields,, the distance is not so great as to prevent the Allies from being in a position one day to interrupt their exploitation and the export of ore byLulea,      The French Government thus consider thats if the

Finnish Government make their appeal, France and GreatBritain could only adopt one attitude and that is toensure the departure of their expeditionary force    evenin the event of Scandinavian refusal,,The French Government for their part hold that these arguments are so strong that, in rejecting them,  theAllied Governments would assume the heaviest responsibilityboth towards Finland and towards their own interests.
