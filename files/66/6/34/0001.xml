WAR CABINET.SUPPLY OP LABOUR FOR THE BRITISH EXPEDITIONARYFORCE.Extract from the Draft Minutes of a Meeting of theMilitary Co-ordination Committee held on the18th March, 1940*.(Circulated hy direction of the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence).

SUPPLY OF LABOUR FOR THE BRITISH EXPEDITIONARY FORCE.( ?/-P, ( G-) ( 4-0) 78 and Ivi.C.(40)  64).THE COMMITTEE had before them the following papers:-( i) A Memorandum by the Secretary of State for war on the Supply of Labour for the british expeditionary Force (W.P. ( G)( 40) 78),,( ii) A Note by the Secretary circulating theConclusions of the War Cabinet thereon(M.C.(40) 64).THE CHAIRMAN suggested that before examining theSecretary of State for War&apos;s proposals for findingadditional labour for the British Expeditionary Forceit would be desirable first for the Committee to satisfy themselves as to the need for such a large quantity oflabour,,Proportion MR,  CHURCHILL pointed out that the proportion ofof Fightinggr-troops to     fighting troops to the total number of men transported tosSearIchelons.France was very lov/ indeed.     He recalled that inFebruary 1915, the comparable date in the last war, wehad 13 infantry divisions and 3 cavalry divisions inFrance.      The total number of men with the british expeditionary Force at that time was 354,000, of which262,000 were in fighting formations and 92,000 behind the lines.     At the present time we had 8 divisions inFrance and two more on the way, but the proportion ofmen behind the lines was certainly very much higher.According to an analysis of the total figures of theBritish Expeditionary Force which had been prepared bythe War Office for his information, there were 100,000men under the heading   of &quot;G.H. Q. and L.  of C. troops&quot;,of which 10-000 were infantry.

MR. STANLEY    interposed that of ,these .7,800 wereG.H.Q0 Reserve and must he counted as a fightingformation in every sense of the vrord,MR. CHURCHILL went on to point out that the numbersof ancillary troops was very high indeed.      For example,there was a total of 36,000 R.4. S.C. , R.A. M.C.  andR.A.O.C. on the lines of communication.      The numbershoivn under the heading of &quot;Labour&quot; amounted to 19,000.In addition there were large numbers of engineer andsignal troops employed behind the lines.     He felt bound to put the point that our Army, in proportion to its total size, produced less than any other in the frontline.      Our base and L,-,  of C. establishments seemed to be altogether disproportionate in size.      The French thoughtthat we were equipped on a scale 50 per cent heavier than their own Army, and the size of our rear organisationsmight give rise to very uncomfortable comparisons by theFrench.      These might indeed have serious politicalrepercuss ions,,MR. STANLEY said that the large numbers in the bases and lines of communication were required for two reasons(i) Our Army was very highly mechanised.(ii) Owing to the danger of air attack we had had touse ports in western France, which necessitated a line of communication 500miles in length, and we had also had todisperse our base depots and organisationsamong 16 different ports,.The Commander-in-Chief of the British ExpeditionaryForce had been pressed to reduce his demands for labour,but he had represented that he could not be responsiblefor maintaining the Army in the field without the labour which he now demanded,,      The War Cabinet would be talcing a

big responsibility to overrule these representations bythe Commaaader-in-Chief and to say that the widedispersion which had been adopted as a precautionagainst air attack was unnecessary.      He produced, astatement showing how the total requirements of labourwere built up.GENERAL GORDON-PINLAYSON said that theuirementsthe Commander-in-Chief1s demands for labour, which had beenprepared by the Quartermaster-General in Prance, had been most carefully scrutinised by the Quartermaster-general at home.      The former had considerably reduced, his original estimate.      It had to be remembered that the part of.France in which we were operating contained large numbersof refugees, and in consequence there was no spareaccommodation - all had to be built new.      Similarlythere was no store accommodation at the ports.     A large amount of railway construction had to be done to providefor the needs of the base depots.      There were otherinstallations such as workshops, bakeries, etc., whichhad to be built.     G.H.Q.  and Corps troops, which theFirst Lord had not counted in fighting formations, werein fact to a large extent fighting troops? being largelycomposed of artillery, engineers, signals, etc.     A greatproportion of the infantry shown at the base were&quot;first reinforcements&quot;, who must also be counted asfighting troops.     Referring to the figure of 27,000 menshown among the total of labour personnel as required for handling stores at ports and depots, he explained thatthousands of tons of stores were beiiig handled every week,not only for maintenance but also for building up reserves.Naturally with 16 different ports in use the labour requirements for this tonnage amounted to a considerablefigure.

THE CHAIRMAN observed that our problem was quite different from that of the French or Germans, who were fighting in their own countries and could use the samebase installations in war as in peace, and the sameaerodromeso      The labour requirements of theCommander-in-Chief had been very carefully scrutinisedalready, and unless the Committee was prepared to carryout a further scrutiny in the closest detail he thought they wouldhave to accept the assurance of the Secretarj7- ofState for War that the figures could not be cut down.It would, of course, be open to the War Cabinet to takethe responsibility of making an arbitrary cut.MR.  CHURCHILL felt that the demand for labour should be subjected to further scrutiny.     He was not satisfied that it could not be reduced.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD thought that unless the First Lordcould convince the 7.&apos;ar Cabinet that the whole organisationof the Army must be re-examined with a view to reducingthe proportion of men behind the fighting formations,there was 210 other course open to the Committee but toaccept the War Office figures for the labour required.MR.  STANLEY said, that he would naturally make ereryendeavour to cut down the amount of labour required, but even if it were halved the problem of finding additional labour, beyond what we now had, would still remain.      Thiswas an urgent matter, and he suggested that the Committeeshould address itself to the proposals which he had putforward in hip iViemorandum.

8 of MR. CHURCHILL thought that it was altogether unsoundreevisions     to oreak up 3 of our 33 divisions in order to provideTab our.16,000 labourers.     He felt that these formations would suffer most seriously in morale if they were to beemployed on mere coolie work.      The total number of divisions which we were putting in the field was verysmall, and it was therefore all the more necessary thatthey should be of the very highest quality.      There was every reason, therefore, for pressing on with their military training and education.MR, STANLEY pointed out that the number of divisions which we could send out to Prance was limited byarmament and equipment rather than by man power.      The3 divisions, parts of which it was proposed to send to france  for labour, were anong the last of the 33 which we now had in being.      They had at present hardly any trainingequipment at all, and their morale would suffer far moreby being kept at home doing nothing than if they were put to useful work in Prance,,      In any case the use ofthese 3 divisions was only proposed as a temporary expedient to bridge the gap until further supplies oflabour became available by the voluntary enlistment ofthe 18-19 age groups, which was the second of his proposals,.      The R.E. and infantry of these divisions would be used, and they would go to Prance with all theirweapons.      They would work two weeks as &quot;labour&quot; and a week on military training, alternately.      vvhen they were nolonger required in Prance, probably about August, theywould return home and complete their training in England.

When they were nolonger required in France, probably about August, theywould return home and complete their training in England,

MR, CHURCHILL asked why it was necessary, to...bring these troops all the way back home again when they were no longer required for- labour.      Could they not complete their training in France?GENERAL GORDON-FINLAYSON said that the French hadbeen approached on the suggestion for training formationsin France but were not in favour of it.MR. BROWN thought that the despatch of these divisions would be a very good temporary expedient.Judging from experience in the last war, the personnel of the divisions would be only too anxious to get toFrance, in whatever capacity they might serve when theyarrived there.VoluntarynlistmentIf the18-19 AgeferoupsaMR. STANLEY explained that by August it was hopedthat sufficient labour to make good the deficiency wouldbe obtained from the voluntary enlistment of the 18-19age groups.     As these men reached the age for inclusion in fighting formations they would be withdrawn to theUnited Kingdom and complete their training there.     as for the pledge given to the House of Commons by his predecessor that men under 20 would not be sent overseas,the spirit of that undertaking clearly was that such men.would not be sent into the line.      He would, of course,put the whole case to the House of Commons and ask forthe pledge to be relaxed in so far as it was necessary tocover the particular proposal under consideration.

MR. CHURCHILL questioned whether the idea of goingoverseas to serve as labourers would be in any way-attractive to these young men.      They could hardly beexpected to take much soldierly pride in such an occupation,MR. STANLEY argued that a great many young men wouldbe only too glad to have the chance of service and to be released from the restriction which prevented theirserving overseas until they were 20.MR. BROWN doubted whether the 40,000 recruits fromthis class which the War Office expected to get would infact be found available.     At, the last count therewere only 30,000 unemployed in this group, and the WarOffice would be competing against many other claimantsfor these men,SIR KINGSLEY WOOD concurred in this view.Employment The discussion then turned on the possibility ofofColonial       obtaining additional labour from the Colonies if thelabour.response of the 18-19 age groups proved insufficient.MR, CALDER said that the War Cabinet had. rejected,on political grounds, a proposal made by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies to recruit Chinese labour while there were so many unemployed in this country.      If,however, the labour was not in fact forthcoming at home,there seemed to be good reason for turning to theColonies for our requirements.      He recalled that 11battalions of the West Indian Regiment had been employed

on labour duties during the last war, though admittedlyonly some 900 had been used in Prance.     The French,however, used their African troops in France, and ifWest Indians were brought over at the right time of year there was no reason why they should not become acclimatisedbefore the cold weather set in.      The West IndianGovernors had estimated that some 40,000 men would beavailable from this source.MR, STANLEY doubted very much whether West Indianlabour would be of any value in France owing to theclimatic conditions.MR.  BROWN saw no political reason why coloniallabour should not be recruited.     He could find largequantities of civilian labour in this country, butthere would inevitably be difficulties with the Frenchif these were sent overseas to France, owing to the wide differences there would be between the respectiverates of pay of French and British civilian labour.MR.  STEPHENSON said that some civilian labourcould no doubt be found from Eire, but the sameobjections would arise on account of rates of pay.THE CHAIRMAN, summarising the discussion, saidthat on the assumption that the Commander-in-Chief&apos;demands could not be cut down (and on this the Secretaryof State for War was fully satisfied), the only solutionseemed to be to accept the War Office proposal to despatch parts of 3 divisions overseas for employment aslabour as a temporary expedient.     To meet the permanentdemand, recourse would have to be had to:-

(i) An intensification of the recruiting campaign of the 35-50 age groups at present beingrecruited in the Auxiliary MilitaryPioneer Corps. .(ii) Voluntary enlistment of the 18-19 age groupson the lines proposed in the War Office- Memorandum,(iii) If the above sources proved insufficient,recruitment of colonial labour.MR. CHURCHILL said that he could not subscribe to these viewse     He thought that the demand for labour should be drastically cut down by reducing the generalstandard of accommodation and maintenanceIndeedadditional fighting formations might well be formed outof the very large numbers of personnel employed in the bases and lines of communication.     He felt very strongly that we were working on the wrong lines altogether atpresent.THE COMMITTEE agreed: -To invite the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence to make an oral report to theWar Cabinet at the meeting to be held onThursday, 21st March, on the lines onwhich he had summed up the discussion,as re cor dedr-abovew........
