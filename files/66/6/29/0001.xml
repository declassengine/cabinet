In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet at their meeting on 2nd March, 1940,* I circulate herewith, for the approval of my colleagues, thedraft of a letter which it is proposed that the Chief of the Imperial General staff should send to General Gamelin as regards the position of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force in relation to the French high command.2. The instructions originally given to the Commander-in-Chief of theBritish Expeditionary Force have been re-drafted, and the Commander-in-chief has been asked if he has any observations to make. I will circulate the revisedinstructions in due course, when his comments, if any, have been considered.x8th March, 1940.Draft Letter from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff toGeneral GamelinI feel that it would be of value to place on record the present position regarding command of the British Expeditionary Force as clarified at our meetingon 1st March, 1940.  As I understand it, the situation is as follows:  Whilst His Majesty&apos;s Government have placed the British ExpeditionaryForce under your command as Commandant en Chef des Forces Terrestres,the command of the Force has, with the full agreement of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, been delegated by you for the time being to the Commandanten Chef des Forces Terrestres Nord-Est, who thus becomes the immediatesuperior of the Commander-in-Chief, British Expeditionary Force. At thesame time you have decided that on questions of high policy theCommander-in-Chief, British Expeditionary Force, should be permitteddirect access to yourself.Should the British Forces in France so increase as to become the equivalent of a group of armies, you may wish to revise these arrangements.I should be grateful if you would kindly confirm that the abovecorrectly states the position.O.F.G.S.W.M.
