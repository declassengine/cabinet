Vtn.CN CP BOOTH APSIOAFrom the United Kingdom High CoflsaiBslonar in the Onion ofSouth Africa,Dated 26th February, X9UO.    Received 8*22 p.m., 26th February,,No. 92.   yqwt Seore^Your telegram Circular 3S No. 9*   Following observationsare submitted by General Smuts begins.     Question of help to finland should be kept carefully distinct from that of norwegian territorial waters,, as there is otherwise seriotis danger ofconfusion in making the one interfere with the execution of theother.I assume that it is most important that Finland shouldhe saved, and need not set out a detailed argument .2 also admit that there is a good case for interfering with the ahuse of Norwegian waters,,     It is clearly contrary to international Law that a warship like the &quot;Altmark&quot; shouldhave had this prolonged and continuous stay in these waters,Even ships in distress are limited in time in this respect.Sven so however the &quot;Altmark&quot; case is not quite conclusive, nor does germany a &quot;barbarous violation of maritime law justify too ar-reaching reprisals against a weak neutral like Norway.It is also well known that the Allies have strong private interests in stopping the passage of Swedish ore, and their action might he attributed to that selfish motive0   Finallyaction against Norwegian waters may strengthen pro Germanleanings in Norway and Sweden and so interfere with Finnishobjective,,As regards transit of forces to Finland Allies have0 aiuch stronger case to present to Norway and Sweden and to theworld.

Swedenshould rest on this strong case under the Covenant.     It is notonly a legal &quot;basis hut calculated to cause the least shock to neutral opiaion.     If Norway and Sweden r&amp;fuse to grant passagethey put themselves in the wrong and appear to submit to Germancoercion.     In that case the Allies would he justified to seiseports, transit passage and means of transport to Finland.Much more would be achieved than merely cutting the line of territorial waters although this also will he incidentallyeffected.     If force has to be used thes^e will he far greatermoral Justification for it- both because of the high end in view and the Covenant of the League and no selfish motive could he ascribed.     Hot much sympathy will he felt for Horway and sweden especially if explicit undertakings are given for fullrestoration and indemnification at the end of the war.My feeling is therefore against contemplated moveand issue of draft statement and for keeping situation clear for more drastic action on Finland&quot; s behalf as was originally contemplated under the Paris Agreement.Finland siwmld make the strongest appeal forassistance at the right moment and the Allies should take action without undue preliminary flourishes and notifications.If well executed this movement may he a real step towards thefinal allied victory.
