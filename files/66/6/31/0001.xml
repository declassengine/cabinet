BRUSSELS.Repeat Paris: The Hague:Your telegram No. 47 (of 16th March):possibility of German attack on Netherlands.Please inform Minister for Foreign Affairs thatI much appreciate his enquiry and will try to let himhave a definite answer as soon as possible.     Since,however, the enquiry relates to action which the Alliesmight contemplate taking, it will be necessary for us to consult the French before a final reply can be given.This will be done with all due discretion, either withM.

If, in the event of a German attack upon theNetherlands, Belgium went to the assistance of theNetherlands, His Majesty&apos;s Government are in no doubt

whatsoever that the Allies would immediately come with allforce to the help of Belgium.4. If, in the event of a German attack upon theNetherlands, the Belgian Government gave no activeassistance to the Netherlands, His Majesty&apos;s government think that the Allies would, in response to a request forassistance from the Netherlands Government, go to theassistance of the Netherlands by operating Air Forcesacross Belgium and that they would also think it necessaryto send troops into Belgium with a view, not only toprotecting themselves, but also to assisting the Dutch ifpossible.5. In either event, the measure and method ofassistance would depend largely upon the character of themilitary dispositions taken by the Netherlands Government.As to these we have no adequate knowledge and without this knowledge, as His Majesty&apos;s Government have frequentlyemphasised to the Belgian Government, assistance cannot be rendered, without what might be dangerous delay.      Itwould be helpful therefore %  the Belgian Governmentcould inform the Netherlands Government of the enquiry which they have made of His Majesty&apos;s Government endsuggest that the Netherlands Government should at o?ice,through whatever channel they might deem most convenient,furnish the British Military Authorities with all -necessaryinformations
