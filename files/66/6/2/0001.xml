PHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care., may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.G R E T.,140172,COPY NO-&quot;AR CABINET.FINLAND AND RUSSIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.I circulates for the information of my colleagues9the record (Annex A) made by the Parliamentary Under-Secret ary of a further interview which he had with theSoviet Ambassador this morning.In speaking as he reports in paragraph ls Mr. Butlerfollowed the line that I had laid down for him with theapproval of the Prime Minister after the Cabinet Meetingof Fridays 23rd february,  at which I reported the firstinterview that he had with M. Maisky,The attitude of M. Maisky seems to me bothridiculous and sinister.      It is ridiculous to put to ussevere terms ands when we say we cannot pass these on tothe Finnish Governments to maintain that this refusal willhave a bad effect on Anglo-Soviet relations.      It issinister for the motives that may lie behind.      Of these do not pretent to speak positivelys but I imagine theprincipal purpose of the Soviet Government must be to try to prove that it is we who are5  and always havebeen, urging the Finns to be intransigeant with theobject of enlarging the theatre of war.

These exchanges with M. Mais Icy have to &quot;be considered in conjunction with the request made to us by the FinnishPresident reported in Helsingfors telegram No.  112s dated17th february,  which I append as Annex Bo      We must sendsome answer and the position has obviously been made moredifficult by the Soviet approach.I suggest the following draft telegram to theFinnish Governments&quot;&quot;While we were considering request of Presidentof the Finnish Republic, the Soviet Ambassador had outlinedto us the terms on which his Government would discuss asettlement with Finland,,      M. Mai sky was informed that HisMajesty&apos;s Government did not feel the terms were suchas to dispose them to act as intermediaries in passingthem on to the Finnish Governments inasmuch as it was open to the Soviet Government to put them direct or through some other agency.     The Soviet Ambassador thereupon saidthat by declining to act as intermediary in this matter?we were &quot;losing an opportunity to improve Anglo-soviet relations&quot; and that &quot;the attitude taken up by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on this question might have unforeseenconsequences&quot;.     The Soviet Ambassador was informed thata continuance of the war must have unforeseen results for Anglo-Soviet relations and that it. was impossible to predict the consequences if the Soviet insisted on their attck and were not able to end the war on terms whichthe Finnish Government could accept.&quot;We are bound to make some reply to the request ofthe Finnish Presidents and while we must scrupulouslyprotect ourselves from in any way sponsoring the Russiantermsy it is in my judgment less than fair to the Finnish

Government to keep them in total ignorance that any suchdemarche has been made0     The consequence of such a communication as I suggest may well &quot;be that the Finns willask us what the terms were.     We can then tell themsandit will be for them to decide whether they pursue the mattereither direct with the Soviet or through the agency of anyother government      We shall have kept ourselves clear withthem of lending any support to the Russian proposals andshall at the same time make it plain to them that we haveconveyed the indirect threat to the Soviet Government thatthey desiredo(initialled)     H,Foreign Office, S*Wo 1*2Ath February, 19L.Q.

ANNEX A.The Soviet Ambassador called on me this mornings    Ireminded hira that  it our last interview I had reserved theposition of H.M.G. on the subject of the most important piece of information which he had brought me, namely the suggestion of certain peace terms designed to end the Soviet-Finnish war.I had on that&apos; occasion reminded him of the official attitudeof H.M.G. towards that war and I was now able to convey to him the views of the British Government upon the terms which hehad put before me.    These terms appeared to go much further than those which the Finnish Government had rejected beforethe Soviet attack took place.    If I had understood the ambassador correctly, the new line on the Karelian Isthmuswould take in the whole of the Marmerheim line and itsfortifications.    In our view, the terms themselves were there-fore very onerous and we could not express any opinion on what would be the attitude of the Finnish Government, who could only answer for themselves.    I presumed that if theSoviet Government wished to obtain the views of the finnish government they would put the terms direct to that government.I said that a continuance of the war must have unforeseenresults for Anglo-Soviet relations and it would be impossibleto see what the consequences would be if the Soviet insistedin their attack and were not able to end the war on terms which the Finnish Government could accept,,2* M. Maisky said that he was disappointed to hear myreply.    The terms were, he thought, the reverse of stiff, theywere under the circumstances quite reasonable.   Had we takeninto account the fact which he had mentioned to me before,  that soviet troops would retire from Petsamo in return for con-cessions in the Karelian Isthmus?    I said I had reported that point and that account has been taken of it.   He said that itwas all very well to mention the fortified line, but he was satisfied that the Soviet troops would have occupied that line and the district in the Karelian Isthmus, which he had mentioned to me, in the course of the next week or two.    Hethought the Finns would be very well advised to accept theterms.3&quot; He wished to put one question to me.    Had he under-stood clearly that H.M.G. would not put these terms to theFinnish Government?    I replied that we declined to put termsof this sort to the Government at Helsinki.    He said that hewas very disappointed to have this answer since a directnegative of this sort would mean that we were losing anopportunity to improve Anglo-Soviet relations.    He had placedgreat hopes on a more favourable answer from the BritishGovernment,  since he had understood that it was not one ofour fundamental aims to spread the theatre of war.    Theattitude taken up by H.M.G. on this question might have unfore-seen consequences.    I replied that it might have unforeseenconsequences for both our countries.    The Ambassador went onto say that there was a Russian proverb,  that you Should be content to seize a titmouse, when you had the opportunity, andnot look upwards in the sky for a crane.    I asked him toexplain the meaning of this proverb.    He said we were refusinga small opportunity for our two countries to get closertogetheri .while we appeared still to hope  that we might obtaingreater advantages by waiting for another time.    I&apos;said thatI  id not consider his proverb very suitable for the occasion,what I thought his government were doing was to ask. us toswallow a crane and hope later for a titmouse.    He must

understand, that the British Government and British publicopinion had had their feelings deeply stirred, by the un-provoked attack of the Soviet Union upon a small and friendlycountry.    Now we were being asked to put our imprimatur on terms which yielded the whole line of the fortificationswhich the Finns had so manfully defended, with all the physical and psychological consequences which might flow from such a surrender.    I repeated that I could not say what view the Finnish Government would take, but to ask theBritish Government to put its imprimatur upon such proposals and then to say that we were losing opportunities of im-proving Anglo-Soviet relations was to place us in a whollyunwarrantable position.    The initiative in proposing these terms had been from the Soviet side.    This the Ambassadoraccepted.    And now just because we would not&apos; place ourselves in a position which his government desired, we were told that we were losing a good opportunity.    I asked, the ambassador to place this matter in its proper perspective.4* In the course of a short general conversation whichensued., I ascertained from the Ambassador that these termshad not in fact been put to the Finnish Government accordingto his own information!    that they had been put to us asa feeler because of the Soviet view that we had from the verystart encouraged the Finnish Government to stand up againstthe Soviet desires.    On this point I told M. Maisky thatwhile our attitude to the Soviet attack had been quite clear from the start, I was quite sure that he did not believe thestories of sinister machinations which were attributed toour Government.    At this he laughed and did not answer.5, Before he left, I said that we appreciated theinformation he had given me in his last conversation, notablyon the subject of the Russian-German trade agreement, theattitude of neutrality which the Soviet Union intended toadopt in this war and their intention not to invade Norwajr&apos;or Sweden if Norway and Sweden did not come into the war onFinland&apos;s side.    These I said were all indications of the ambassador&apos;s desire to reassure this country to the bestextent that lay in his personal power.    He replied that hetrusted contact would be maintained with him and that he wouldbe available when desired.    He made it quite clear, however,that the answer which I had given him at the request of theSecretary of State was a serious one and. that the issues at stake were not small.r.a.  butler.24th February,  1940.

ANNEX E.10 e cypher,,Mr. Snow (Helsingfors)17th February,  1940.D.6.50 p.m.    20th February, 1940.R.7.50 p.m.    20th February, 1940.No.  112.Following is repetition of my telegram No. 112of 17th February.My telegram No.  109.I had a farewell audience with the President ofthe Republic yesterday afternoon.      The Minister forForeign Affairs was present.     The latter confirmed theSwedish refusal to sanction the despatch of troopsen masse, and said that the Finnish Government had informed the Swedish Government in consequenco thatthey   now had no alternative but to appeal to theUnited Kingdom /grp. undee7 for help,      (This implies that Finland has now broken with the Swedish policyof isolating the Finnish struggle from the european war).2. The President of the Republic then said that he wished me to request that His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe French Government would at once inform the SovietGoveraament  that if the latter /?would not7 respond to the Finnish Government&apos;s known desire /GPLJ11Q7 thematter, it would have a /^marked/ effect on the future course of the allied Governments relations with theSoviet Union. .

3e The President of the Republic put this forward as the only step which could be taken by the western powers which offered any prospect of any immediaterelief for Finland.      The despatch of munitions wouldtake time, of men even longer.     Accordingly the step in question represented the greatest service that could now be offered and he put it forward as his lastrequest to me as Minister of this post.4. He considered that in view of possible develop-ments elsewhere e.g. in the Caucasus, the step suggested would give the Soviet Government serious grounds for^?prompt7 preoccupation and would as the Minister forForeign Affairs put it,  in any case !iclear the grounddiplomatically for any action v/hich the western governments might later decide to take5&apos;.      If the stepcould be accompanied by any kind of naval or militarymoves, he considered that the effect would naturally&apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;        &apos;   :be all the greater but he did not wish to insist onthis aspect.Addressed to Foreign Office,  repeated to stockholm No.  15.
