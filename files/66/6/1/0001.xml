DRAFT 2-.iaM0RANDUM.His Majesty&apos;s government in the United Kingdom havegiven careful consideration to the suggestion of theFrench Government in the aide-memoire communicated by theFrench Ambassador on 22nd February, that advantage shouldbe taken of the &quot;Altmark&quot;  incident to effect an immediateoccupation of Norwegian ports in order to show theSwedish Government that the Allies are in a position to afford Sweden immediate efficacious assistance againstGermany, and thus to induce them to permit the passageof Allied troops to Finland.20     His Majesty&apos;s Government must observe in the firstplace that neutral opinion in general, while favourable to their proceedings in the case of the &quot;Aitmark&quot; in sofar as it approved their humanitarian motive in freeing the prisoners on that vessel and considered the conduct of theNorwegian Government ambiguous and unjustified on broadgrounds of equity, has by no means taken the view that no case could be made for the Norwegian Government from thestrictly legal standpoint or that the conduct of thatGovernment was so flagrant as to justify a demand forBritish control of Norwegian waters,  and the occupation of norwegian ports if that demand were refused.      It seems certain, therefore, that the exploitation of the case inthe manner suggested would have the gravest effect on neutral opinion, including the United States of America.3,    Nor does it seem probable that such action wouldmake the Swedish Government any more willing to permit thepassage of Allied troops to Finland than they might otherwise be:    on the contrary, Swedish public opinion,which has already shown itself critical of the British&apos;    &apos;&apos;. -1-

action in the case of the &quot;Altmark&quot;, owing to its fear of possible&apos; German reactions, would he likely to feel still greater alarm at the prospect of permitting the passageof troops of a   Power which had just seized the ports ofa neighbouring    country without, in the Swedish view,any justification for such violent action;    and the net result of the proceedings would be that the Allies wouldbe faced not only with the necessity of coercing aninevitably hostile Norway, but also with a Sweden fromwhich no sympathy or co-operation could any longer beexpected,     The more probable immediate result in ourview would be to make Sweden dangerously complacent inthe matter of German iron ore supplies through the Baltic,which we should be powerless to prevent.4*    His Majesty&apos;s Government fear that in their view theproposed action seems to offer no certain advantage sufficientto offset its obvious disadvantages on moral grounds.      Itis likely, in their view, not to facilitate, but rather to make still more difficult of execution,  the plan for sending help to Finland;    it does not increasethe prospectof the Allies being able to interfere with shipments of swedish iron ore to . erramy;    and it would inevitably face the Allies with the hostility of Norway, and Sweden, andwith the disapprobation of neutral opinion throughout theworld0
