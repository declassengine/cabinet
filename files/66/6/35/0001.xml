naval situation.General Review.THE principal event of the week has been the enemy air attack on Scapa.There was no U-boat activity until the 20th March, when neutral casualties were reported off the north-east coast.   Air attacks on East Coast shipping continue.Home Waters.2. At dusk on the 16th March an attack was made on Scapa by fifteenenemy bombers operating in small groups, and continued from 7-45 p.m. until9 p.m.3. It is reported that only the first wave of five aircraft attacked the ships in harbour, dropping about 20 bombs. This attack came in low and climbedon reaching Scapa Flow to make dive-bombing attacks on the fleet.H.M.S. Norfolk was hit on the quarter deck and holed by a near miss aft,4 officers being killed and 4 officers and 3 ratings wounded. The damage to theship necessitates docking, but she was capable of steaming at 10 knots, and has since arrived at the Clyde. H.M.S. Iron Duke (depot ship) was also damaged by two near misses, and one other capital ship was attacked but not hit.4. The remaining aircraft dropped a large number of high explosive and incendiary bombs near LTatston Aerodrome and at Bridge of Waith on the road between Kirkwall and Stromness. About 120 high explosive and over 500incendiary bombs were dropped in all. Eight craters were made in the air-field atHatston, some eight hundred yards from the hangars, and one bomb fell near a bomb store. No other damage was done to air force objectives, but two cottageswere damaged at Bridge of Waith, one civilian being killed and seven injured.Details of the defensive action taken are included in the Air paragraphs below.5. H.M.S. Guardian (net layer), two anti-submarine trawlers, three smallmerchant vessels and three fishing trawlers were attacked by enemy aircraft onthe morning of the 17th between Aberdeen and the Firth of Forth, but no damage was sustained. In the afternoon of that day a small merchant vessel was alsounsuccessfully attacked off the Yorkshire coast. H.M. Trawler Windermerewas bombed 18 miles east of Copinsay (Orkneys) on the 20th, and has been towedinto Aberdeen by H.M.S. Ivanhoe.6. H.M. Trawler Peridot was damaged by a mine off Dover on the morning of the 15th and eventually sank. There were no casualties. On the morning of the 17th March, H.M.S. Intrepid collided with the Lowestoft trawlerOcean Drift (227 tons), 50 miles north-east of Kinnaird Head. The trawlerwas sunk, but H.M.S. Intrepid, who had her stem damaged, proceeded toInvergordon with eight survivors from the trawler. At about 3-15 a.m. on the19th March, H.M.S. Jervis collided with the Swedish S.S. Tors, which was only slightly damaged. The Jervis, however, had extensive hull damage above and below the water line, and 18 ratings were killed. She had to proceed stern first,at 5 knots, to the Tyne, where she arrived safely. At 11 p.m., the 19th March,H.M. Trawler Lady PMlomena was in collision with the Fleetwood trawlerLowdock (276 tons) off Todd Head, near Stonehaven. The Lowdock sank at once and there was only one survivor. At about 1-30 a.m. on the 20th, the armed merchant cruiser Carinthia, inward bound to the Clyde, and the armed merchant cruiser Cilicia, outward bound, collided about 80 miles north of Ireland. TheCilicia was badly damaged, but has reached Belfast.Foreign Waters.7. A bomb exploded in the bomb room of H.M.S. Eagle (aircraft carrier)on the 14th March, causing extensive structural damage. One officer and twelveratings were killed, and five ratings were seriously wounded. The ship has arrivedat Singapore for detailed examination.
German Intelligence.8. Information has been received from a fairly reliable source that on the13th March the German battle cruiser Gneisenau was at Wilhelmshaven, andthe cruisers Karlsruhe and Emden at Kiel.9. At the beginning of the week there were very few U-boats at sea, andat the present time there are no reports of U-boats off the West Coast. OneU-boat is believed to be operating in the Moray Firth, and one or two arepatrolling near the Orkneys and Shetlands.10. The A it mark has been ordered by the Norwegian authorities to be readyto sail from Sandef jord at 24 hours&apos; notice.Anti-Submarine Operations.11. The absence of U-boats has reduced anti-submarine operations to aminimum, and only three attacks have been carried out during the week, none ofwhich has produced definite results.Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. 875 ships, including 51 Allied and 237 Neutral, have been convoyedduring the week. Included in this number are five ocean convoys : two fromHalifax, two from Sierra Leone and one from Gibraltar, comprising 116 ships, all of which have reached their unloading ports without loss. Four Norwegianconvoys, consisting of 21 British and 95 Neutral ships, have sailed this week; oneof these convoys was attacked by enemy aircraft on the 20th March, and damage was done to three neutral ships. Forty destroyers and nineteen escort vessels havebeen employed in escort duties, in addition to two battleships and five armed merchant cruisers for ocean escorts.13. Since the commencement of hostilities 13,673 ships have been convoyed,982 ships from Gibraltar, 963 from Halifax, 498 from Sierra Leone, over 1,000ships to or from Norway and 5,739 up or down the east coast of England.25 British, 1 Allied and 2 Neutral ships have been lost in convoy by enemy action,a loss equivalent to one ship in 488.14. Cargoes which arrived this week included 236,256 tons of cereals,123,324 tons of other food-stuffs, of which 19,410 tons were fresh fruit, and148,088 tons of minerai ores. 31 tankers brought 345,438 tons of oil and spirit,of which 62,500 tons went to French ports.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.15. Ten ships giving a total of 22,802 tons have been sunk this week. one british (1,589 tons), one French (3,173 tons), and three neutral ships (11,613 tons)were mined and five Danish ships (6,427 tons) were torpedoed. The Dutch tankerPhobus was mined in the Thames Estuary, and is now at anchor, but the extentof the damage has not yet been ascertained. Three Norwegian, one Swedish andone British ship were attacked and damaged by enemy aircraft while in anoutgoing Norwegian convoy on the 20th March. One, the Norwegian S.S. Svinta(1,267 tons), was abandoned. She was subsequently torpedoed and sunk when into. The British S.S. Barnhill (5,439 tons) was attacked on the same evening and set on fire.  The ship is likely to become a total wreck.16. In addition to the above, two Greek ships (6,539 tons) are now so longoverdue that they are now regarded as lost by the Greek authorities. Detailsof attacks are given in Appendices I and II.German Minelaying.17. In the past week there has been no first-hand information of Germanminelaying, though it is suspected that mines have been laid off the Dutch coast and on the route between Holland and the Thames Estuary. Enemy aircraft,possibly minelaying, were reported on the night of the 14th off Cromier, and onthe early morning of the 15th and 19th in the vicinity of the Thames. An enemy[21019] b 2
minelayer and patrol vessel were believed on.good authority to be operating ina position 75 miles north-west of Terschelling on the morning of the 15th. Fastsurface craft were reported between Cromer and Yarmouth on the night ofthe 14th 15th.British Minesweeping.18. H.M. Drifter Maida (magnetic sweeper) was mined and sunk offNorth Foreland on the 16th March.   Six of her crew are missing.19. Minesweeping operations have been carried out in the Humber area,and 16 moored mines have been exploded. Traffic from the Downs to Hollandwas held up on the 17th and 18th March owing to the loss of three ships alongthis route. It is now proposed to establish a searched channel in. this area, whichis in process of being swept by a paddle minesweeping flotilla escorted by Frenchdestroyers. Experiments are being carried out to determine whether mine-sweeping trawlers are capable of sweeping a clear channel ahead of an 8-knotconvoy down the whole length of the East Coast war channel. 260 moored mines and 67 magnetic mines have been accounted for since the outbreak of war.German Merchant Shipping.20. Three ships with iron-ore sailed from Narvik between the 11th and16th March, and on the following clay there were 7 ships in this port loadingor waiting to load. The Konigsburg (6,466 tons) is reported to have loaded a cargo of rubber at Para (Brazil) and ber departure from that port is to beanticipated.21. The total tonnage of German merchant shipping at the beginning ofthe war was estimated to be 4,492,708 tons, of which 1,173,000 tons is still inforeign neutral ports. Losses from scuttling, prizes and marine risks haveaccounted for 326,764 tons.Economic Warfare.British Contraband Control.22. On the 19th March, there were 29 neutral ships in the three contraband control bases in the United Kingdom, of which 12 had been there for four days or less. During the week ending the 16th March the contraband controlconsidered the cargoes of 77 ships which had. arrived since the 9th March, and24 outstanding cargoes from the previous week. In 44 cases entire cargoes were released either on first consideration or after enquiries. During the week1,571 tons of goods destined for Germany were seized in prize.. The main items were 110 tons of base metals, 296 tons of oil seeds, 595 tons of foodproducts and 150 tons of gums and resins.23. The U.S.S.R. S.S. V. Maiakovsky was intercepted by the armed merchant cruiser Kanimbla on the 15th March, 500 miles north-east of Tokyo,and is being escorted to Hong Kong. The main cargo consists of 4,582 tonsof copper.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.24. Enemy patrols have been a little more active, particularly in areaswest of the Vosges.  Enemy artillery fire has been local and unimportant.Germany.25. A survey of recent reports indicates that work on the northern exten-sion of the Siegfried. Line is to be resumed with renewed vigour directly the weather is suitable. Air photographs taken on the 11th March reveal a forwardline of defences under construction in advance of the Siegfried Line, in. thearea south of Saarbrucken. These consist of a number of concrete forts behindwire and two rows of anti-tank obstacles.
26. A number of recent reports state that field works are being constructedon the German-Lithuanian frontier] Although details of the localities or natureof the works are not yet known, there is no doubt that they have been constructedduring the last few months.Italy.27. On the 13th March General Soddu, the Under-Secretary of State forWar, introducing the military budget for 1940-41, referred to the reorganisa-tion of the Italian army in binaria (two-regiment) divisions as pratically complete. He also stated that 132 black shirt militia battalions had been incorporated in infantry divisions, although it is understood from official sourcesthat many months will elapse before the Blackshirts are completely incorporatedand all details of the final organisation determined.The despatch of new drafts to overseas garrisons in Albania, Libya andthe Dodecanese appears temporarily to have ceased.28. In Italian East Africa, Abebe Aragai, the principal rebel leader inthe Ancober District, was reported last October to be short of arms and ammuni-tion. Since then it appears that the Italians have been giving him food and money to keep him quiet. According to a report dated the 21st February, hisformal submission is expected in the near future. The main rebel concentra-tions continue north and south of Lake Tana, where the Italians are still engagedin the task of pacification. Some minor clashes with the rebels were reportedin February.Far Bast.29. On the 11th March Russian aircraft flew across the frontier between northern (Soviet) and Southern (Japanese) Saghalien; indignation has been caused by this incident. A border clash was also reported between Russian and japanese patrols on the 15th March, involving a few casualties on either side;there is an unconfirmed report of a similar clash on the Manchukuo-Soviet border.These occurrences illustrate the tension that exists on the Russo-Japanese frontier,but there is no reason to anticipate that it will be aggravated.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.Attack on Enemy Base at Hornnm (Sylt).30. The main operation of the week, namely, the attack on Sylt carried out during the night of the 19th-20th March, was the largest air attack undertaken by either side since the beginning of the war. The night was one of clear moon-light, with areas of cloud over the North Sea, becoming somewhat denser towardsmorning. In all, thirty Whitleys and twenty Ilampdens were despatched, outof which twenty-nine Whitleys and seventeen Hampdens reached the target; ofthe remaining aircraft, three turned back owing to technical trouble, and one was unable to locate the target. The first aircraft reached Sylt at 2000 hours, andthe target was from then on attacked at intervals during a period of six hours in all. One of the Whitleys is missing and was probably shot down by enemyanti-aircraft fire; two others were slightly damaged, but the rest of our aircraftall returned undamaged to their bases.31. The object of the attack was the seaplane base of Hornum at thesouthern end of the Island of Sylt. Forty 500-lb. bombs, eighty-four 250-lb. bombs and 1,260 incendiary bombs were d ropped/jwa-i-bly from jjeig-hte-Qf-beriween 3,060aftd-^rOOO-feet. Reports of the damage done are not yet complete, but severalhits are reported on hangars and close to a light railway, oil tanks and a seaplanejetty. Two hangars were set on fire, and thus gave a clear indication of the objective to the remainder of our attacking aircraft. The only opposition met with was from searchlights and anti-aircraft fire. Only two enemy aircraft, aMesserschmitt 109 and a Heinkel float-plane, were encountered.
32. A reconnaissance was carried out by two Blenheims during the morning of the 20th in order to penetrate to the objective of the previous night&apos;s attackif conditions were suitable. They reached the neighbourhood of Sylt, but the weather and anti-aircraft fire were such that it was not possible to make an effective reconnaissance of the damage done. One enemy fighter made an attackwithout success.33. A similar reconnaissance was attempted by a Blenheim on the21st March, but lack of cloud-cover prevented the aircraft from reaching itsobjective.Night Reconnaissances and Leaflet-dropping Operations.34. The weather was unfavourable for operations on the 14th, 17th and18th March, but reconnaissances, during which leaflets were dropped, were carried out on the nights of the 15th-16th, 16th-7th and 20th-21st, with theadditional objects of reconnaissances and training in the recognition of objectives.35. During the week a total of thirty aircraft made reconnaissances and dropped a total of over 4 million leaflets over North-West Germany, the Ruhr,the Rhine Valley, Hamburg, Prague and Warsaw.36.   The two aircraft concerned in the operation over Warsaw droppedPolish leaflets.   They took off from an aerodrome in this country and landed in france after a flight of more than eleven hours.   One of them, as its petrol was nearly exhausted and as the pilot was uncertain as to his whereabouts, made aA LiM^B-fe    forced landing.  The arrival of German^feseepe disclosed the fact that the landing&apos; had been made in Germany, but the pilot succeeded in taking off again and landing in France a short while afterwards.Offensive Patrols and Reconnaissances.37. Offensive patrols over enemy bases and the Heligoland Bight area havebeen regularly maintained whenever conditions made it advisable.38. Daylight reconnaissances were carried out in force by fifteen aircraft on the 15th March, and by twelve aircraft on the 16th. On the first occasionconditions of visibility were unfavourable and did not permit of attack on anenemy minelayer whose position had been indicated by wireless interception. Onthe 16th. however, various enemy vessels which opened fire on our aircraft wereL. ctffcsdud- ijbembod and photographed.   The extent of the damage done is uncertain.   Eightiisrith (rcwiAn   enemy fighters were seen and evaded at various times.39. A day reconnaissance of the Heligoland Bight area, directedparticularly to the identification of German &quot; Flak&quot; ships, was carried out by six Blenheims on the 19th. Visibility was poor and little was seen. One of our aircraft was attacked by two and another by four Messerschmitts, but bothescaped without difficulty. One &quot;Flak&quot; ship was seen, and two patrol vessels were attacked with bombs.40. Similar reconnaissances were carried out on the 20th and 21st, and on each occasion our aircraft dropped bombs on ships, which opened fire on them.Fighter Command.A attack on Scapa Flow.41. During the attack on Scapa Flow, a detailed description of which isgiven under &quot; Naval Situation,&quot; our fighters were not able to operate over the-Artillery Zone of the fleet owing to heavy anti-aircraft fire from shore batteries.Six Gladiators and six Hurricanes were despatched, but no contact with enemy aircraft was made, although German broadcasts suggest that the enemy wasimpressed by the danger of fighter interception and hurried his attacks inconsequence. The only confirmed enemy loss is that of one bomber, which forced-landed on a Danish island in the Baltic and whose crew has been interned.
Other Fighter Activities.42. When attacks were made on shipping off Aberdeenshire during the morning of the 17th March, Spitfires engaged a Heinkel 111 and a Dornier 17or 215.   The combats were, however, inconclusive.43. On the evening of the 20th March two Fleet Air Arm Skuas, on patrolwith a convoy, engaged about ten Heinkels who made off. Later another Skua-sighted a single Heinkel attacking merchant shipping, and succeeded in damagingit severely before it escaped into cloud. The undercarriage was seen to be downand the Skua was covered with oil from the Heinkel. The loss of one aircraft is admitted by the Germans.Coastal Command.44. The only attack was made by a Hudson on a U-boat which was sightedabout eighty miles west of the entrance to the Stavanger Fjord on the morning ofthe 14th March. This attack was recorded in last weefe&apos;s Summary, but no details were available at the time. The U-Boat was seen about a mile away and wascrash-diving, when three 250-lb. bombs were dropped by our aircraft from a low-level. The nearest bomb fell some fifteen yards from the submarine as it dived,and a brownish patch appeared on the water after the attack.45. Convoy escorts of the usual type were maintained for fifty-eight convoys,and numerous merchant vessels not in convoy were sighted and identified bypatrols. The vessels sighted included two German merchantmen seen in norwegian territorial waters. Coastal Command aircraft have contacted enemy aircraft on four occasions during the week. On two of these occasions indecisiveengagements&apos;took place.British Air Forces in France.46. The activity of the Army Co-operation Squadrons was again limited topractice flights. Nineteen patrols, involving thirty-nine aircraft, were flown by fighters of the Advanced Air Striking Force, and forty-one patrols were flown by the Air Component.  No contact was made with the enemy.French Air Activity.47. Bad weather limited activity during the latter part of the week, butreconnaissances, primarily for the purpose of observing rail activity, were carriedout on the 15th, 16th and 17th March.German Air Activity.Operations.48. The main feature of German air activity during the week was the attack on Scapa Flow referred to earlier in this Resume.49. This attack, and those on the Narvik convoys on the 20th March, were on a somewhat larger scale than previous attacks on similar objectives, butpresented no other novel features. The tactics employed have already becomefamiliar; it is, however, interesting that a single aircraft was employed overthe Channel on the night of the 20th March as on that of the 2nd March (whenthe Domala was attacked), while the main activity lay elsewhere. The attack onHatston aerodrome does appear to represent a change of policy, and althoughfuture developments cannot be foreseen, it may indicate an intention to developfull-scale air attack tentatively and gradually, rather than by a sudden concen-tration of force. This would clearly have certain advantages, in particular, inregard to possible effects on neutral opinion.50. Apart from these main attacks activity was confined to operations overthe North Sea.
51. Wireless interceptions indicated that nine or ten aircraft were activeduring the morning and afternoon of the 15th.52. Aircraft of two German bomber Geschwader were again active inconsiderable numbers during the morning of the 17th March, and one aircraft,apparently on reconnaissance, was plotted over the Scapa area. On the20th March day reconnaissances in the neighbourhood of the Orkneys were followed by considerable bomber activity at dusk, directed mainly against the outward- and homeward-bound Narvik convoys.Civil Aviation.53. It is reported that the following air connections with Russia will &apos;be operated under military control as from 21st March :  (a) Friedrichshaf en-Prague -Krakau - Kamenes- Podolski - Odessa-Achiar-Batum-Tiflis-Baku.(b) Berlin-Krakau-Kiev.(c) Munster-Prague-Krakau with branch lines to Kiev, to Odessa and toBatum.Foreign Air Intelligence.Russia.54. According to reports received, 100 U.S.S.R. Air Force technicians areto work in German aircraft factories in order to gain experience. German flyinginstructors are believed to be employed in teaching Russian pilots at a flying-Training School in Russian-occupied Poland.55. Ever since the signing of the Bulgarian-Russian Air Conventionallowing for the operation of a Soviet Civil Air Service from Moscow to Sofia,there have been numerous reports, mostly emanating from neighbouring balkan states, of Russian activities at the airport of Bourgas, where, it was stated,special facilities were being granted to the Soviet Government. These reports are officially denied by the Bulgarian Government, who state that no exceptionalfacilities are being granted to the Russians; no buildings are being erected atBourgas aerodrome except one small one for housing the Russian air personnel,and no work of a military character is in progress there.Bulgaria.56. It is known that Bulgaria has placed orders with Germany for approxi-mately 150 additional aircraft. Half of these are German and half are Czechtypes. It is not believed that any of these have been delivered so far, butreports indicate that shipment of aircraft to Bulgaria from Germany is scheduledto take place as soon as the Danube is free from ice.Roumania.57. Considerable difficulty is being experienced in obtaining spare parts and accessories from Germany for German aircraft in service with the RoumanianAir Force. A wagon-load of spare parts left Stuttgart on the 20th December,1939, and two months later it had not reached the Roumanian frontier. Germanfirms are now quoting ten to twelve months delay in delivery for small machine tools. In one case a German firm refused to supply certain instruments unlessplatinum and iridium required in their making was supplied from Roumania.Turkey.58. Of the aircraft ordered by the Turkish Government the following havebeen delivered :  25 Curtiss Wright Falcon 22 advanced training aircraft from U.S.A.16 Hurricanes, which were off-loaded at Istanbul on the 25th February,and are now being assembled at Yesilkoy.
7 Lysanders, Mk. II, Bristol XII engines, which were delivered to turkey in early March, and which are at present being assembled. A further 6 Lysandershave been shipped from United Kingdom, but have not yet arrived, making atotal of 13 aircraft despatched out of a total order of 36.50 Hanriot 182 trainers, representing a total order of the type, have been delivered. Some of these have been assembled and are already in use at the flying Training School at Eskisehir.Iraq.59. The Iraqi Ministry of Defence has renewed for three months the contract of the Italian instructor-pilot, Signor Guza, and may extend it further.The four Italian mechanics have also had their contracts renewed until May1940, when, on completion of their two years, they will be required to leave thecountry. Considerable difficulty is still experienced by the Iraqis in maintaining and flying the Italian aircraft in service with the Iraqi air force.Oil Supplies.60. The Italian oil-tanker S.S. Torchillo, capacity 3,400 tons, has beenchartered by Germany and is employed at Varna in Bulgaria for storage; theuse of a second tanker for the same purpose is planned. Ten 600-ton tankers, inaddition, are being built at Varna. This storage accommodation is intended for Russian oil from. Batum, which will then be sent by rail to the Danube atRustchuk; the capacity of the 300 tanker cars provided is expected to be 700 tonsof oil a day. Similar arrangements are being made for storage of 35,000 tons at Constanza on the Roumanian coast, and for further storage at Brailla on the danube. Ten storage tanks at Giurgiu on the Danube, opposite Rustchuk, are probably intended for Roumanian oil.[21019]c
