MESSAGE TO BE BROADCAST BY THE B.B.C. ANDFRENCH STATIONS AT 12 MIDNIGHT ON THE night of APRIL 4th to 5th.We have a most important message for allneutral shipping on German internal navigable waters.In view of the illegal and inhuman campaign against shipping being pursued by the German Government,His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and theFrench Government have decided that so long as it is continued they will take action to restrict navigationon German internal waterways, and they desire,  inconsideration of and by way of warning to non-combatantsand neutrals, to give advice of their intention.     they accordingly give notice that as from now,  12 midnight on April 4th/5th, all internal navigable waterways ofGermany constitute an area dangerous to shipping.    Allneutral vessels on the internal navigable waters ofGermany are therefore urgently advised to leave thosewaters at the earliest possible moment.

DRAFT PUBLIC DECLARATION TO BE BROADCAST BY THEB.B.C. AND FRENCH STATIONS AT 0 a.n,(PROVISIONAL)ON APRIL 5tho.In recent weeks the German campaign againstthe merchant shipping of all nations has &quot;been intensified and pursued with even greater brutalitythan before.     The number of neutral ships destroyedby German action is now well over 150, and the numberof neutral lives lost is over 1,000.     These attacks have been carried -;)ut in almost every case in defiance of the recognised rules of war, frequently in circumstances of the greatest barbarity, and on many occasions without the slightest justification forinterference of any sort with the ship.      Germany has announced that she regards herself as entitled to destroy any neutral ship en route to any British port,including contraband control harbours, and there have,moreover, been repeated cases of vessels being destroyed on voyage between two neutral ports, whenthe vessel had no intention of touching at a Britishport at all.      It is obvious that the German Governmentare engaged in an indiscriminate campaign of destructionthroughout the waters in which their unnotified minesare laid, or in which their submarines are in aposition to operate.2.     While in recent weeks the greatest losses have fallen upon neutral shipping,  British and Alliedvessels have also suffered from the adoption of thispolicy of destruction, a new development of which is the bombing from the air of British and neutral trawlers an-1fishing boats and the machine-gunning of their crews.The innocent character of fishing boats has hitherto been universally recognised, but this had nt*t preventedGermany from committing nearly 200 attacks on fishing vessels,  aimed at sinking them and murdering their crews.- 2 -

Even lightships, the object of which is to protectshipping of all nations and which are by internationalusage treated as non-combatants, have been with theirorews ruthlessly attacked by bombs.,3.      On the other hand, the Allies have notonly saved the lives of many innocent victims ofthese German outrages, but they have not failed to rescue from drowning German airmen and submarinecrews who have been guilty of the inhumanities inquestion.4*     The position is thereforj that Germany isflagrantly violating neutral rights in order to damage the Allied countries, while insisting uponthe strictest observance of rules of neutralitywhenever such observance would provide some advantage to herselfo     International law has always recognised the right of a belligerent, when its enemy hassystematically resorted to illegal practices, totake action appropriate to the situation created bythe illegalities of the enemy,,     Such action, eventhough not lawful in ordinary circumstances, becomes,and is generally recognised to become, lawful inview of the other belligerent&apos;s violation of law.The Allied Governments therefore hold themselvesentitled to take such action as they may deem properin the present circumstances05.      In view of the policy thus deliberatelyadopted by the German Government, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the French Government have decidedthat so long as it is continued it is imperativefor them to take retaliatory action,  in order to restore the balance wantonly disturbed by the German

campaign of illegalities.      They have therefore,  as already announced,   taken action to restrict navigationon German internal waterways,  and have given duenotice that the internal navigable waters of Germanyconstitute an area dangerous to shipping,60      Mention has already been made of the Germancampaign at once to flout and to profit by the laws of war at sea     His Majesty&apos;s Government haveobserved that a heavy proportion of the lossesinfliobed upon neutral countries, both of human life and in material, has fallen upon the NorwegianMercantile Marine.      Yet while the German Governmentrepeatedly sink Norwegian shipping and murderNorwegian seamen,  they continue to demand from theNorwegian Government the fullest use of norwegian territorial waters for their own commerce,  and theNorwegian Government have gone so far as to providearmed escort in these waters for German ships, while taking no effective action against German brutalityon the high seas,  of which their own vessels havebeen the victims.70      Whatever may be the actual policy which theNorwegian Government, by German threats and pressure,are compelled to follow,  the Allied Governments cannot longer afford to acquiesce in the present state ofaffairs by which Germany obtains resources vital toher prosecution of the war, and obtains from Norwayfacilities which place the Allies at a dangerousdisadvantage,,     They have therefore already givenf\f\ notice to the Norwegian Government that they reservei the right to take such measures as they may think necessary to hinder or prevent Germany from obtaining

in Norway resources or facilities which, for thepurpose of the war, would be to her advantage or tothe disadvantage of the Allies,     The Allies,however, will certainly never follow the Germanexample of inhumanity and violence, and if thesuccessful prosecution trf the war now requires themto take such measures, world opinion will not be slow to realise both the necessity under which theyare constrained to act and the purpose of their action.     Their purpose in this war is to establishprinciples which the smaller States of Europe would themselves wish to see prevail and upon which thevery existence of those States ultimately depends.8.     His Majesty&apos;s Government have accordinglyresolved to deny the continued use by the enemy ofstretches of territorial waters which are clearlyof particular value to him, and they have therefore decided to prevent unhindered passage of vesselscarrying contraband of war through norwegian territorial waters.     They accordingly hereby give notice that the following areas of norwegian territorial waters have been rendered dangerous to navigation on account of mines:-Vessels entering these areas will do so attheir peril.-STADTLANDET.
