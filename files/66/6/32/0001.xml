SQUADRONSISINGAPCRif to INDIA,Memorandum by the. Chief l; of Staff,..C.QiTOrlt.teecThe War Cabinet will recall that on the outbreakof - war that part of the air plan for the reinforcement of singapore which related to the dispatch from India of twomedium bomber squadrons was put into operation,,      This was intended as an insurance against the possibility of japanese hostility.2. Since then the situation has changed materially inthat the risk of war with Japan has considerably receded,while that of war with Russia has increased, with the resulting implications on the situation in India and theMiddle East.3. We consider,  therefore, that the time has come when the two Blenheim squadrons sent from India last september should be recalled to India, where they wouldbe more suitably placed either to reinforce Iraq or Egyptor to act as a counter to Russian air action againstNorthern India.    They could of course,  if the situation at singapore suddenly deterioriated, rapidly be sent backthere if the balance of risk so required.4. In recommending the above measure, between do not wishto give the impression that there can be a generalrelaxation of our precautionary measures in the Far East,The withdrawal of these Squadrons throws an additionalresponsibility on the remainder of the garrison of singapore, arc1 v&quot;oVes it all the more iiuportaut that allunits should be ale,.&apos;&quot; cirri efficient.      This aspect of

the matter has &quot;been under consideration by the oversea Defence Committee,  and we understand that a communication is about to be addressed to the governor of the Straits Settlements, urging him to take such measures as may be practicable, without therebycausJxg.,dislocation of the vital tin and rubberindustries, to extend the training of the Volunteerunits.      In this way it may be possible to correctany false impression which would, otherwise be causedby the mo^e-Of tJ^se-4? quadroons.(Signed)        C.L.N.
