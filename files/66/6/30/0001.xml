THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY Of HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTTS GOVERNMENTSCANDINAVIA AND BALTIC STATES. March 15, 1940.CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.Amended Section.[N 3333/2/63] Copy No.   027Viscount Halifax to Sir R. Campbell (Paris).(No. 599.)Sir, Foreign Office, March 15, 1940.THE French Ambassador called this afternoon and handed me a note, acopy of which is attached, which, he said, contained the views of the FrenchGovernment as to the action which should now be taken by the Allies to meet thenew situation created by the end of the Finnish war. The French Government,M. Corbin said, were somewhat anxious about the present situation, which wascausing a feeling of unrest in France and some uncertainty abroad; and in thecircumstances they had instructed him to suggest that consideration should once again be given to the proposal for Allied control of Scandinavian territorial waters and, if necessary, occupation of certain Norwegian ports.2. The Ambassador went on to say that, in the view of his Government, thevarious objections put forward in His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s note of the29th February were no longer valid. Moreover, it was for consideration whetherthe behaviour of Norway and Sweden during the Finnish war had, in fact, been as neutral as the Allies had a right to expect. In practice the attitude whichthese States had adopted had favoured German policy, and it was clear that theyhad accepted German recommendations. There was also the plain fact that theyhad neglected their duty to help the victim of aggression. The French Govern-ment, M. Corbin continued, considered that it was necessary from the point ofview of public opinion in the neutral countries that the Allies should do something to prove that they still had in their hands the possibility of action.In the Ambassador&apos;s view, each time the Allies had taken action which might be described as strong rather than correct it had had a most advantageous effect sofar as neutral opinion was concerned.3. I told his Excellency that I would, of course, see that the french governments note was given urgent consideration. I said that I did not at allunderrate the arguments and feelings of the French Government. I thought,however, that there were two ways in which one might view the general problem which now faced the Allies. One way was the way which the French Govern-menfs note perhaps advocated; that is to say, that it was important to take theinitiative and to impress the neutrals with our ability to take strong action.There was a very strong case for action in this sense. The other way was to askourselves whether, in the new situation created by the Soviet-Finnish peace, itmight not be possible to develop in a manner satisfactory to ourselves the belatedrecognition by the three northern States that they ought to form some sort of alliance. From this latter point of view, it was essential that the Allies shouldnot act in such a way as to force Norway and Sweden on to the German side. the dominant emotion in these two countries was fear, and we must be careful notto take action which would be insufficient to outweigh fear of Germany and whichmight none the less be sufficient to forfeit a measure of Norwegian and Swedishgoodwill that might otherwise be useful to us.4. I went on to say that it seemed to me that it was significant that thefigures of the Scandinavian iron-ore output during the last two or three monthswere very low. This was partly the result of the fact that the ports had beenice-bound, but it was perhaps also a result of a general willingness to try and go slow. It was always possible also that, if we took the action which the FrenchGovernment now proposed, this might react unfavourably on Norwegian suppliesof iron-ore to ourselves and on the supply of Norwegian shipping, which was most-useful to us.5. The Ambassador admitted that there was some force in what I had said,but he emphasised that, in the view of his Government, the general situation made it essential to take account of the psychological effect of initiative on our part.I am, &amp;c.HALIFAX.3-85]
Enclosure.Memorandum.LE Gouvernement frangais a etudie avec soin le memorandum remis parLord Halifax a M. Corbin le 29 fevrier dernier au sujet de 1&apos;exercice du controleallie dans les eaux territoriales scandinaves et de l&apos;occupation eventuelle de portsnorvegiens.La situation a laquelle se referait le document britannique s&apos;est depuis lorsmalheureusement modified par suite de la capitulation finlandaise. Aux yeuxdu Gouvernement frangais, le nouvel etat de choses appelle les considerationssuivantes :Tout d&apos;abord les Allies n&apos;ont plus a se predccuper des repercussions que pour-rait avoir sur la position de la Finlande Tetablissement d&apos;un controle allie dansles eaux territoriales norvegiennes. Les objections formulees a ce sujet dans lememorandum anglais se trouvent desormais sans ported. Par centre, la fin deshostilites entre les Soviets et la Finlande ne remedie en rien a V impuissance de laNorvege a faire respecter par FAllemagne la neutralite de ses eaux territoriales.Le Gouvernement frangais attribue done toujours la meme valeur aux raisons quicoinmandent une operation destined a mettre fin a un pareil etat de choses et arenforcer notre controle des voies maritimes en mer clu Nord. II s&apos;agit en somme,aujourd&apos;hui comme hier, d&apos;intercepter le minerai suedois a destination de 1&apos;Alle-magne, d&apos;amener une reaction allemande pouvant apporter elle-meme lajustification d&apos;une entreprise plus large par la suite, enfin d&apos;etablir un controlepermanent sur la disposition du minerai scandinave.A ces raisons viennent s&apos;en aj outer deux autres dont le Gouvernement anglaismesurera certainement toute 1&apos;importance. La fin de la resistance finlandaiseet la constatation de notre impuissance a la soutenir sont aujourd&apos;hui presenteesau monde entier, par la propagande germano-sovietique, comme un echec grave pour les Allies. Nous ne pouvons empecher que les neutres, et meme ceux d&apos;entre euxqui nous sont sympathiques, ne tirent des evenements un pronostic defavorablequant aux facteurs d&apos;energie, d&apos;initiative et d&apos;audace que peut comporter notrecoalition. Nos opinions publiques sont elles-memes impressionnees par la defaited&apos;un petit peuple dont elles etaient portees a confondre la cause avec la notre.Une initiative hardie et immediate de notre part en Norvege serait necessaireaujourd&apos;hui pour renverser ce courant et arreter a temps les consequencesinquietantes d&apos;une degradation generate de notre position diplomatique etmilitaire, aussi bien que de notre autorite morale.En second lieu, le role preponderant joue dans le movement del&apos;affairefinlandaise par la Suede et la Norvege nous oblige a reviser notre attitude a 1&apos;egarddes neutres et a distinguer entre les pays qui pratiquent loyalement leur neutraliteet ceux qui en usent a notre egard pour servir les desseins du Reich.Ces derniers Etats, proteges par nos scrupules juridiques, menaces par laforce allemande, comptant finalement sur notre victoire pour retablir 1&apos;equilibrequ&apos;ils auront laisse rompre a notre detriment, se flattent en attendant de pouvoirceder sans risquer a toute pression de nos ennemis. La tolerance de la Norvege a1&apos;egard des atteintes allemandes a sa neutralite maritime, Faction exercee par laSuede sur la Finlande en violation de ses devoirs de neutre et de membre de laSociete des Nations, sont autant d&apos;exemples caracteristiques de cette politique a,double face : elle paralyse nos reactions aux entreprises memes du Reich auquelelle facilite la voie.Nous maintenir dans cette immobilite ne serait done que garantir le respectd&apos;une neutralite fictive. En persistant dans notre inaction, nous ne perdrions passettlement les fruits qu&apos;une decision appropriee aux realites nous permettrait derecueillir; nous encouragerions en outre tous les neutres a, se laisser glisser sur cettememe pente et a consentir, sous le voile d&apos;une neutralite qui ne sera invoqueequ&apos;a notre endroit, toutes les complaisances et toutes les facilites que la craiiitedu Reich mettra celui-ci a meme d&apos;exiger d&apos;eux.Le Gouver frangais estime en resume que la prise effective du controledes eaux territoriales norvegiennes, completee s&apos;il le faut par 1&apos;occupation despoints d&apos;appui terrestres qui en assurent refficacite, a conserve ces memesjustifications qu&apos;invoquait le Gouvernement britannique en Janvier dernier et
que le Gouvernement francais rappelait au lendemain de 1&apos;incident de VAltmark.L&apos;operation repond toujours a des raisons strategiques qui n&apos;ont pas cesse sur leplan general de la guerre de militer en sa faveur. Enfin, la necessite de redresserla position des Allies aux yeux du monde entier et de leur propre opinion publique,d&apos;autre part la legitimite d&apos;adapter leur politique envers les neutres a 1&apos;usageEquivoque qu&apos;ils font eux-memes de leur neutrality, s&apos;imposent une initiative proprea^retablir 1&apos;equilibre moral et materiel que Tissue du conflit finlandais a rompuen notre defaveur.Telles sont les vues que M. Daladier a prie 1&apos;Ambassadeur de France aLondres de soumettre d&apos;urgence a Lord Halifax et au Premier Ministre. Lagravite des circonstances parait justifier une decision immediate au sujet delaquelle le Gouvernement francais est pret a prendre sa part de responsabilite etespere rencontrer promptement les vues du Gouvernement britannique.Le 15 mars 1940.(Translation.)The French Government have examined with care the note handed by lord halifax to M. Corbin on the 29th February last, on the subject of the exerciseof Allied control in Scandinavian territorial waters, and of the eventualoccupation of Norwegian ports.The situation to which the British note referred has since unfortunatelybeen modified, owing to the capitulation of Finland. In the opinion of theFrench Government the new state of affairs invites the following considera-tions : First, the Allies no longer need consider the repercussions which the establish-ment of Allied control in Norwegian territorial waters might have on the positionof Finland. The objections on this head in the English note are no longerapplicable. On the other hand, the cessation of hostilities between the Sovietsand Finland does nothing to remedy the inability of Norway to make Germanyrespect the neutrality of her territorial waters. The French Government,therefore, still attach the same weight to the considerations which call for an operation to put an end to such a state of affairs and reinforce our control of thesea-routes in the North Sea. In short, now as then, it is a question of interceptingthe Swedish iron ore destined for Germany; of inducing a reaction on the partof Germany which might itself eventually provide the justification for a morefar-reaching undertaking; finally, of establishing permanent control over thedisposal of the Scandinavian ore.In addition to these reasons there are two others, of which the BritishGovernment will not fail to appreciate the full importance. The end of the resistance of Finland and the demonstration of our inability to maintain it arenow presented to the whole world by German-Soviet propaganda as a seriousreverse for the Allies. We cannot prevent the neutrals, even those among themwho are sympathetic to us, from drawing from what has happened an unfavour-able impression of the potential energy, initiative and daring of our coalition.Even the public opinion in our two countries is impressed by the defeat of asmall people whose cause they were led to identify with their own.A bold and immediate initiative on our part in Norway would now benecessary to reverse this trend and check in good time the disquietingconsequences of a general deterioration both in our diplomatic and military position and in our moral authority.In the second place, the outstanding role played by Sweden and Norwayin the final stages of the Finnish affair, obliges us to revise our attitude towardsthe neutrals and to distinguish between countries which loyally enforce their neutrality and those which make use of it in their dealings with us to serve thedesigns of the Reich.These latter States, protected by our legal scruples, threatened by Germanforce, relying in the end on our victory to re-establish the equilibrium which theyallow to be disturbed to our detriment, are meanwhile so misguided as to believethat they may always yield without risk to the pressure of our enemies. Norway&apos;stolerance towards the German infringements of her territorial waters, the pressure put by Sweden upon Finland in violation of her duties as a neutral andas a member of the League of Nations, are characteristic examples of this
two-faced policy : while it paralyses our ability to counter the moves of the reich, it makes things easy for the Germans.To continue in this state of immobility would thus only be to guaranteerespect for a fictitious neutrality. By persisting in our inaction we should notonly lose the advantages which a decision appropriate to the realities of thesituation would enable us to obtain; we should also be encouraging all neutralsto fall into the same ways and, under the cloak of a neutrality which will only be invoked against us, to grant every favour and every facility which fear ofthe Reich will enable it to exact from them.To sum up, the French Government feel that the effective seizure of controlover Norwegian territorial waters, completed if need be by the occupation of thevantage points on land which would ensure its effectiveness, still has the samejustification which the British Government claimed in January last and to whichthe French Government again called attention immediately after the Altmarkincident. This operation still complies with strategic considerations, which havenot ceased, in relation to the general conduct of the war, to militate in its favour.Finally, the necessity of re-establishing the position of the Allies in the eyes ofthe whole world and of their own public opinion and, on the other hand, thelegitimacy of adapting their policy towards neutrals to the equivocal use whichthe neutrals themselves make of their neutrality, obliges us to take an initiativewhich will restore the moral and material equilibrium disturbed to our disadvantage by the outcome of the Finnish conflict.Such are the views which M. Daladier has asked the French Ambassador inLondon to submit urgently to Lord Halifax and to the Prime Minister. the gravity of the circumstances seems to justify an immediate decision in which theFrench Government are ready to take their share of responsibility, and on whichthey hope to receive without delay the views of the British Government.H.
