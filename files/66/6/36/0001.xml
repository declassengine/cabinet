The following notes are not exhaustive, but may serve as a guide : (A) Staff Conversations.(1) With Belgium.Questionnaires submitted through &quot; special contact.&quot; Some replies. Franco-Belgian contacts are suspected, but we have no official knowledge of their nature and scope.(2) With the Netherlands.Questionnaires submitted very recently. No replies, but atmosphere reportedto be not unfavourable.(B) Assurances.I. United Kingdom to Belgium.(a) To Belgian Government. Locarno undertakings of assistance in the eventof unprovoked aggression maintained provided Belgium defendsherself, the 24th April, 1937. Renewed the 28th August, 1939,14th January, 1940.Belgian Government informed the 28th August, 1939, that HisMajesty&apos;s Government will respect Belgian neutrality so long as it isrespected by other Powers.Belgian attitude at that date; determined to maintain neutrality;will appeal to United Kingdom if object of aggression, but wantsaction delayed until appeal has been made.10943   [21030]
(b) To King of the Belgians. If Belgium invokes Allied assistance andthereupon becomes involved in hostilities, assurances given as regardsparticipation in peace negotiations, integrity of Belgian territories,and post-war reconstruction. These assurances replace those given onthe 14th January about which, owing to slight misunderstanding,King Leopold was unhappy.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brussels has not yet handed inrevised assurances, but will do so at first opportunity. It is intendedto tell Trench Prime Minister of what has passed personally andconfidentially at a later stage. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Parishas been kept fully informed.Note. French agreed to acceptance of King&apos;s original request,and were informed of the general terms of our reply of the14th January.II. To the Netherlands.The 1st September: &quot; If in the event of a European war Netherlands adoptan attitude of neutrality His Majesty&apos;s Government will . . . . be resolutelydetermined to respect this neutrality fully provided that it is respected by other powers.&quot;III. Belgium to the Netherlands and vice versa.None known, but Belgian Foreign Minister stated on the 19th december that &quot; while he could not say in advance what the attitude Belgium wouldbe in the event of the &apos; independent and neutral&apos; situation of Holland being-modified, such modification could not possibly leave Belgium indifferent.&quot;(C) Allied action in various Contingencies.I. Simple cases.[a) German attack on Belgium (1) Belgium invokes assistance before or immediately on German attack-Allied troops advance.(2) Belgium does not invoke  assistance Allied  troops  advance.Note.-The Cabinet have decided, W.M. (40) 74, Conclusion 7 (2),   Ithat if Germany invaded Belgium, Allied forces should immediatelymove into Belgium without waiting for an invitation, but this inten-tion should not be made known to Belgian Government lest in should   jjjgive them the impression that it was a matter of indifference to us   ,iwhether they invited us into their country.   French High Commandconfirm that French forces will also march at once.   Attitude ofFrench Government is assumed to be the same, but point has not yetbeen formally confirmed with them.(b) German attack on the Netherlands Belgium going to the support of the  INetherlands.Belgium informed on the 20th March that, subject to French Hviews, Allies would come with all force to the help of Belgium.We have suggested that Belgium should consult with the Dutch.   french  consulted. M. Reynaud says prima facie he is in agree- 9ment, but must consult his advisers.Dutch about to be informed.II. Complex Cases.(a) German attack on the Netherlands Belgium holding aloof.Belgians recently asked us what we would do on the hypothesis Iof Belgian assistance to the Netherlands.   In addition to answer Bquoted in paragraph (&amp;) above, Belgian Government were told that, fljsubject to French views, if they decided not to help the Netherlands,&quot; the Allies would, in response to a request for assistance from the fljNetherlands, go to the assistance of the Netherlands by operating air flj
oforces across Belgium, and that they would also think it necessary tosend troops into Belgium with a view not only of protecting them-selves, but also to giving all possible assistance to the Dutch.&quot;Note. Compare Cabinet decision in note to paragraph C (I)(a) (2) above.Dutch are about to be informed.M. Reynaud agrees, subject to consultation with his advisers.Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs became much agitated atapparent possibility of Allied forces crossing Belgium without consentof Belgian Government and enquired whether this was really intended.No reply has been given to M. Spaak.Note. Belgian fear may be so great on this score that they, mayattempt to dissuade the Dutch from invoking Allied assistance. Onthe other hand, the Allied offer to the Dutch is far more attractive ifthey know that help will be sent irrespective of the Belgian attitude.French attitude, Avhich they claim is legally sound, is believed to bethat, if Holland is invaded and Belgians do not assist, the Allies willhave the right to make use of Belgian territory.(&amp;) Netherlands under pressure give the Germans Naval or Air facilities onDutch soil.Note. This possibility has been raised by the French, but wehave no confirmation that such action by the Dutch is probable.The action which would be open to the Allies in this eventualityis still being examined.(e) It is conceivable that Dutch might put up a token resistance and thensubmit, but this seems highly improbable and any action would presumably be similar to that taken in case (&amp;) above.Foreign- Office, March 26, 1940.
