This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentPrinted for the Cabinet, February, 1940SECRETCopy No.   p jW.P. (40) 74 ^ *TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document!WAR CABINETHIGHER COMMAND OF THE BRITISH LAND FORGES operating in FRANCEMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. At the meeting of the War Cabinet on 22nd February, 1940,* I warnedmy colleagues of the difficulties which had arisen in connection with the command of.the, Army in France and told them that on the return of the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff from France, where he had gone to obtain LordGorfs views, I should wish to bring the matter before the War Cabinet.2. The Report of the Chiefs of Staff Committee on this subject(C.O.S. (40.) 239), which is attached as an Appendix to this memorandum,sets out fully and clearly both the historical aspects of the matter and also therecent correspondence between General Gamelin and the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff.3. From this paper the following main points emerge:  [a) The British Government, during the Anglo-French Staff talks in August,1939, agreed to the subordination of Lord Gort to the french commander-in-Chief, i.e., General Gamelin, though it was understoodthat he might delegate his authority to the Commander-in-Chief inFrance (if appointed) or to the Commander of the French Army ofthe North-East.(0) From the beginning of the war it has been thought by the BiitishGovernment that use had been made of this proviso and that general gamelin&apos;s authority had been delegated to General Georges. Thiswas confirmed by a Note from our Military Attache on 3rd September,and as a consequence the instruction issued to Lord Gort by my predecessor on behalf of the War Cabinet contained the following passage &quot; You will be under the Command of the french commander-in-Chief N.E. Theatre of Operations &quot;. In fact, sincethe arrival of the British Expeditionary Force, Lord Gort has on anumber,of occasions received and acted on orders from general george.(c) General Gamelin&apos;s letter states categorically that the assumption onwhich we have consistently acted since the beginning of the war isill-founded, that he has delegated no part of his authority to general george and that Lord Gort and the British Expeditionary Forceremain subordinated to himself alone.4. Clearly a position of very great difficulty has arisen. On the one hand,both the Chief of the Imperial General Staff and Lord Gort, who are in complete agreement on the matter, regard with the gravest apprehension the change now contemplated. The existing system has worked admirably, with no friction andwith the happiest personal relationship. It is felt very strongly that, whatever may be the position when the British Expeditionary Force grows in size, atpresent, when it is a comparatively small force, its well-being and securityW.M.

depend on its being under the command of that same General who will be issuingorders to the French armies on each side of it. In particular grave dangersmight arise in connection with the use of French reserves in support of oursection, and the passage in General Gamelin&apos;s .letter drawing the analogy ofMarechal Petain has a sinister ring for those who remember March, 1918.5. On the other hand, General Gamelin is clearly acting within his rights,as the subordination was to him personally and any further delegation was leftto his discretion. This position presumably could only be reviewed by a decisionof the Supreme War Council. Such a course, which would have the effect ofmaking the British Expeditionary Force a bone of contention in any obscureFrench political or military intrigues which may be going on, must be avoided,if it can be done without compromising the security of our forces.6. Under the circumstances I suggest that the first thing to do is to trytactfully to get General Gamelin to acquiesce in, and indeed to formalize, the resumption of the relations which have existed hitherto between Lord Gort andGeneral Georges, and I ask that the Chief of the Imperial General Staff beauthorized by the War Cabinet to visit General Gamelin, explain to him theviews of the War Cabinet and attempt to reach agreement with him.7. If this effort fails, there are only two alternatives. Both the Chief of theImperial General Staff and Lord Gort feel that the position, though less happythan the original arrangement, would lose much of its dangers if General Gamelinrestricted himself to the issue of strategic directifs, while tactical and operationalorders came from General Georges. This would be in the nature of a face-saverfor General Gamelin, who might be willing to accept this compromise, when he might feel unable to agree to the complete reversal of his claims.8. If either the War Cabinet feel this compromise to be insecure and unsatisfactory, or General Gamelin refuses to accept it, then nothing remainsbut to take the matter up with the French Government, either informally betweenthe Prime Minister and M. Daladier or formally as a subject for discussion at theSupreme War Council.O.F.G.S.The War Office,2,6th February, 1940.(b40/8)   5o   2/40   W.O.P.   4732

(40)259.(Also )T40) 67), )Mill-1 IIII1IIWHM-WAR CABINET.CHIEFS OP STAFF COMMITTEE.HIGHER COMMAND OF BRITISH LAND FORCES operating in FRANCE.REPORT.It has recently come to light that there is some misunderstanding as to whether the British Expeditionary Forcein France is under the Command of General Georges (commander of &quot;Front Nord-Est&quot;) or directly under the Command of general gamelin (Commander-in-Chief, Forces Terrestres).    It hasalways been understood in the War Office that the british expeditionary Force had been placed by General Gamelin underthe Command of General Georges, and Lord Gort, himself, hasheld the same view.    One oy-&apos; two matters have recently occurredwhich threw doubt on the situation.    In order to clarify thematter, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff wrote a letterto General Gamelin, the revelant extracts of which are asfollows&quot; I suggest that the matter of the issue oforders to the British Expeditionary Force in Francerequires clarificationoWe are prepared to accept any reasonableconditions considered necessary by the French high command.We consider that It is desirable that onecondition should be fulfilled - that is that theBritish Expeditionary Force should be under- oneFrench authority.    All dual authority should be avoided.    Should the Commander-in-Chief of theBritish Expeditionary Force receive orders direct from you, it is undesirable that an intermediateauthority such as the Commander of a Group or armies should be inserted between the british expeditionary Force and yourself^_______Sh-Quld-you-,however,  decide to place-the&quot; &quot;British ExpeditionaryForce under the., orders of the Commander of a group of Armies, then, in my opinion,  the latterGommand-er alone should issue orders to theCommander-in-Ohief of the British&apos; ExpeditionaryForce.3        5        5e       5        5z-1-

The underlying principle should he thatthere should ho no delay in the executionof orders.2.General Gamclin has replied as follows&apos; 1 acknowledge receipt17th inst.of your letter of thoI have always considered the british expeditionary Corps in France as &quot;being directly under my orders.      I am, in effect,  accordingto my letter of instructions,  Chief of theGeneral Staff of the National Defence and commander-in-Chief of the Land Forces, personallyaccredited for the purpose of settling all questions relating to the Allies and centralisingall our relations with them.It has never boon in ray mind tou:pc di t i onary C c rCommander o:js under thein Army Group.orcicrsput theof aIt was merely understood in order to simplify matters that General Gort could inall matters of routine service deal directly with General Georges, Commander-in-Chief of theFrench&apos; Forces on the North-Eastern Front, whosecommand as far as operations are concerned isanalagous at the moment to that which MarshalPotain had at the end of the last War2T      I!3. The past history of the case is as follows :- -In April, 1939.   at the time of our Staff conversations with the French, the Chiefs of Staff considered the questionof the organisation of the Higher Command in France in war,and they submitted a Report on the subject to the Committeeof Imperial Defence (Paper No. D.P.(P) 50).      In this,  theysummarised the history of Allied Command in France during thelate war,  and arrived at the following recommendation:-w12. v&apos;&apos;e recommend that the arrangements forcommand of the Field Force should be based onthe subordination of its Commander to the FrenchC ommando r-in-Chi of in F rance.15. Under the present organisation,  general gamelin, as Supreme Commander-in-Chief in \7ar,would have under his command two separate armies in France, besides tho Army of North Africa,  theFrench Air Force, and,  in certain circumstances,the French Navy.    It is possible that this systemmay be altered by the appointment of a Commander-in-Chief of the .Armies in France.    In cither case,in   placing the British Field Force under the  eg.

command of General Gamclin, it would be necessary,in ordor not unduly to restrict his discretion inits employment; to agree to its subordination, if general Gamolin so desires, cither to the Commandor-in.-b.hiof in Prance (if appointed) or to theCommander of the French ;;Army of the North-Eastn.    &quot;4. This Report was approved by the Committee of ImperialDefence25- in the following terms which were repeated verbatimby the United Kingdom: Delegation at the Staff Conversationswhen communicating the decision in writing to their Frenchcolleagues:-&quot; The arrangements for the Command of the BritishField Force, when operating on the Continent,  shouldbe based on the subordination of its Commander to theFrench Commander-in-Chief, on the understanding thatthe Commander of the British Field Force will be at liberty to api^eal to his own Government beforeexecuting any order which appears to him to imperil the British Army,      w5. This proposal was agreed to by the French delegation on the 28th August, 1939-6. In the weeks immediately preceding the outbreak ofwar,  the French had not decided the exact organisation whichthey would adopt for their Higher Command in France.      It was generally thought that there would be a Commander-in-chief ofthe Armies of the North-Fast, who would be General Georges;and it was understood that the British Expeditionary Force,in the early stages of the war, would be under his Command.The only confirmation of this is a note from our military attache in Paris dated 3rd September, 1939, written after discussion with General Dents (then Deputy&apos;Chief of staff at the Ministcre do la Guerre).      In this note, there was adiagram which showed General Georges as commanding the NorthFast Theatre,  and it was stated ;-&quot;The British Field Force will come directly underthe orders of General Georges.&quot;7, This view was in accord with that formed by the warOffice as a result of discussions with the French Staffprior to the outbreak of war which was reflected in theinstructions issued to General lord Gort on his assumingCommand of the British Expeditionary Force..    The relevantparagraph is as follows&quot;2*      You v/ill be under the command of the french commander-in-Chief, North Fast theatre ofoperations1&apos;&apos;.8. Since the arrival of the British Expeditionary Forcein France,  they have received orders on a number of occasionsfrom General Georges,  and have dealt with his Headquarters onall matters such as the taking over of the line, the relief of French troops, etc.x   C.I ,D. .368th Meeting, Minute k.

i9. General Game lin1s reply to the letter from the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff has apparently altered therelations between General Georges and Lord Gort and there is good reason to believe that it does not accord with theposition as at present understood by cither of thorn.10.have given careful consideration to the situationwhich has arisen.      In our opinion, in view of terras in whichthe Government decision to piece the British ExpeditionaryForce under French Command were communicated to the French,thuro socms no doubt that it must be left to General Gomelinhimself to decide whether the British Expeditionary force should be directly under his command or under General Georges.11. From the practical point of view the latter wouldseem operationally preferable whilst the British ExpeditionaryForce remains a small force operating on a part of the frontfor which General Georges is responsible and forming in factan enclave in the front allotted to one of his Groups or armies.    If in these circumstances it receives its ordersdirect from General Game1in it may be very difficult tooo-ordinate its operations with those of the French Armieson its flanks who receive their orders not even direct fromGeneral Georges but from one of his subordinate cornmanders.On the other hand when the British Expeditionaryincreases to a size o.t all corrroarablc to the force12.Force increases to a size et all comparable to the force atthe disposal of General Georges and when its commander Is inconsequence in a position to take over from General Georgesresponsibility for an appreciable sector of the front,  therewould be every advantage in its Commander being directly under General Gamclin and co-cqual with General Georges.this apparent changeIt is however vital13. Wo are unaware of the reasons for of policy on the part of General Gar/10lin.that the Commander-in-Chicnot find himself the subject of a disagreement between twoFrench Commanders, and we should not appear to query GeneralBritish Expeditionary Force shouldGame1 i n&apos; s decision unlos.&apos;Force is in doubt.ihc safety cf the British ExpeditionaryIn conclusion we point out that -Ik. The position of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,British Air Forces in Franco    yis-a-yis, the French high command, has always been quite&quot; c&quot;lear &quot;and is in no way changed,by General Gomel in&apos;s letter&apos; of 17th February.      Air MarshalBarratt1s instructions contain the following passage -15.&quot;His position vis-a-vis his own Government will be similar to that&quot; of&apos; the&quot; Commander-in-Chief, british expeditionary Force, but he will not be under theorders of any French General&quot;.j6The      reply to General Gamelin is annexed.ierrace, 817,  1, ,^3rc\ February,  1940,(Signed.)

.AHNKX,letter promith^ chief OF the IMPERIAL GENERAL&apos;STAFF to GENERAL GAMELIN.Thank you for your letter of 18th February, 1940.There was of course no doubt that the british expeditionary Force was under your orders, hut His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had always understood that you had delegatedthe direct command to General Georges as Commander-in-ChiefNord Est.     This was accepted and Lord Gorfs instructions were- worded accordingly,,      It has always been a matter ofgreat satisfaction that relations between General Georgesand Lord Gort have been so cordial.In subordinating the British Expeditionary Force to your command,  the British Government is prepared, as Istated in my letter of 17th February, to accept any reasonable arrangement which you consider desirable.In my own view there would be many advantages to us if the B.E.F. were directly under your command.   At thesame time I feel that at its present strength and holdingas it does a comparatively small sectoi* of the North EastFront, practical operational difficulties may arise if theForce is not under the commander responsible for operations on that Front.     Difficulty and delay might,, in my opinionwell accrue in co-ordinating its action with that of theFrench Armies on its flanks0On the other hand when the B.E.F. reaches a sufficient strength for its commander definitely to take over fromthe Commander-in-Chief North East Front the wholeresponsibility for a definite sector of the front I canforesee every advantage in the Fox^ce being directly underyour commandoWhatever you may decide, I would urge that yourdecision should be made known at an early dateYou will appreciate that I am most anxious that there shouldbe no ambiguity as to the Commander from the Commander-in-Ohief, British Expeditionary Force receives his orders andexactly in what spheres he deals with the Commander-in-Chief?Word Est.You will doubtless be issuing a directive on thesubject to General Georgesa      If I might have a copy i will than if necessary approach His Majesty5s Governmentwith a view to amending the instructions to Lord Gort.
