The policy however also involved disadvantagesand hazards such as:-The diversion of Allied forces and resources to &quot;killing Russians&quot; that we need for &quot;killingGermans&quot;?

A possible fiasco owing to the refusal by-Norway or Sweden or both to facilitate passage to Finland:An extension of the war to Russia withwidespread threats to British interests in theNear, Middle and Far East:-A possible drawing together of Germany and russia with the organisation of Russian services by German brains:Riding rough-shod over Norway and Swedenwith a serious impairment of our moral position:An almost certain failure to preserve tothe Finns more than a fraction of their territory,owing to the inadequacy of our railway communicationsGrave risks of our being unable to preventthe over-running of Southern Sweden and Norwayby Germany by air and perhaps by land forces;.The possible eventual establishment ofGermany and Russia on the North Sea shores of scandinavia,,3. Perhaps materially on balance we have not come out of the affair so badly, but morally the Allies andthe whole cause of democracy received a resounding blow.In many countries, even some most friendly to our cause*the Finnish surrender was spoken of, most unfairly, asa German diplomatic victory.    To a considerable extentth.Gse  &quot;Wet impressions have been removed by the PrimeMinister&apos;s speech, and by the attack on Sylt, but thefull effects on neutrals, especially in the Balkans,are not yet discernible0    The question now arises ofwhat we are to do next.   Are we to leave the initiativeto the enemy?   Or are we to seize it ourselves?   And,if so, where and how?4, Up to now our military policy has been governed by the relative backwardness of our defensive andoffensive preparations0    The rate at which we can

create new Army divisions and R.A.F. squadronswill obviously be largely reduced if we have to repair at the same time the wastage of activemodern warfare.    Consequently a policy calculated to precipitate unlimited warfare is liable to postpone the date at which the maximum effort ofthe Allies can be achieved.    All this points tothe desirability of our preserving a position ofstatic warfare as long as possible.5. Against that we have to set the general question of our prestige, which is especially im-portant at the present juncture as well as theconsideration that the Prench nation is said tobe highly restive under present conditions.Temperamentally the French find the position of amobilised army concentrated on the frontier withoutfighting very irksome;    economically it is tellingon their staying power;    and socially there ismuch discomfort.    The absence of military activitypreys on their nerves and tends towards introspectivecontemplation of their internal difficulties.    Onthe other hand, the x^rench have a lot of leeway tomake up in their own preparations, especially intheir Air Force and in the matter of heavy artillery,.The women and children may regret the absence ofthe breadwinner, but they have not the gnawinganxiety as to the safety of their menfolk whichmodern war brings in its train.    In these circum-stances it ought to be possible, by appropriatepropaganda, to maintain the morale of the Frenchnation for some months to come.

60 In the circumstances,  subject to secondarynaval or military diversions and the Royal marine operation,  it would appear best, notwithstanding the disadvantage of leaving the main initiative tothe enemy, for the Allies to continue&apos; their policyof static warfare until such time as the enemydisturbs itD    But we must have our plans and preparations ready, the moment that disturbanceoccurs, not only actively to defend ourselves against attack, but to counter-attack with all our power,,The Enemy&apos;s Plans?7. What are likely to be the enemy&apos;s plans?There is a good deal of evidence to show that inthe present war he regards this country as the archenemy0    He recognises that his greatest-danger is from the strangling effect of sea-power.    Herealises also not only that this country is the main-spring of the economic warfare he dreads, but alsothat we are far more dependent than he himself on overseas supplies.    It is for that reason that, fromthe outset of war, he has had resort to every kindof maritime frightfulness to damage our sea-power -by surface raiders, submarines, torpedoes, moored andmagnetic mines, aircraft.    This type of warfare alsofits in with his economic needs,  since it can be greatly accentuated without making too heavy ademand on his oil supplies or railway communications.There seems to have been a good deal of boastful

talk about some such attack by leading Germans,in their conversations with Mr.  Sumner Welles andin Italy, and not long ago there was a publicpronouncement to this effect by Admiral Raeder.Probable Form-of Attack in the West,..8. The most probable form of attack in thewest,  therefore, which we may expect in the nearfuture is a sustained offensive by all the meansmentioned above against our shipping, especially the vulnerable maritime communications on theeast coast.    The obvious replies to this arecounter attacks, by air   such as the Sylt affair,and the Royal Marine operation.    We ought to do our utmost to overcome French objections to thelatter.9i It is not impossible that the attack maybe extended to our ports, where there are alwaysaggregations of shipping and all kinds of othervulnerable objectives such as oil tanks, docks and locks, pumping stations?  transit sheds,facilities for loading and landing and railway sidings.The main deterrent to this form of attack is that our

civilians will be killed in large numbers,  so thatthe enemy will have to expect reprisals on a large scale;    and this must soon lead to unlimited airbombingo      This is a development of the war that theenemy may well hesitate to precipitate.   Attack onports,  therefore,  can be placed in a lower priority of probability than those on shipping.     nevertheless we ought to be prepared for them,  and to have ourcounter-offensive measures fully worked out,10.       Attack on Holland also falls into the secondorder of priority, but cannot be excluded from ourcalculations.     Notwithstanding our economic warfare,Germany derives from a neutral Holland considerableeconomic advantages which she may well hesitate to sacrifice for the advantages she might hope to gain from the establishment of submarine and air basesa few miles nearer to this country.      On balance shestands to lose at least as much materially as shegains from this operation, which,  on the whole, appearsto be bound up with Germany&apos;s general policy on theWestern Pronto11.       Nevertheless, the over-running of Holland,following on the collapse of Finland, would be a moraldisaster to the Allies of the first magnitude, andwould have terrible repercussions on all the neutrals,great and small.      I submit that a fresh study in a constructive spirit ought to be made of the possibilitiesof making some contribution to the defence of Holland by air or by sea or by land,  through Belgium,  or by counter-attack.      The soundings received by Sir LancelotOliphant since these words were written strengthen thexargument in favour of this. .&apos;.ince these words were written the War Cabinet have started toe-examine the question of assistance to Holland-6-

12. On the whole, a major military offensive onthe Western Front appears unlikely for some timeto come.     The enemy has, no doubt,  sufficient stocksof material of all kinds,  including oil, to sustainsuch an operation for a time, but before embarking on it he would probably prefer to feel more certainabout the future of his oil supplies.      That line of thought takes us to Eastern Europe.13.       Before leaving the Western theatre of war,however,  it is worth recording that the presentquiescence is strangely reminiscent of that curiousand rather sinister lull that preceded the last andhitherto the most desperate assault ever directed against this country, namely, the drive towards theFrench Channel Ports, which began on 21st March, 1918.The. Near East.14.       Now that German and Russian preoccupationsover Scandinavia are removed, Germany is quite certain to turn her attention to the.opportunities offered by the vast open frontier on her eastern borders for&apos;countering the Allied blookade.      Looking at thematter from a long-range point of view she probablyrelies largely on Russia to make good her deficiencies.It is likely, however, to take much persuasion beforeRussia can be induced to allow German brains to re-organise her resources and divert them to German needs,and even after Russian goodwill is secured the processmay take some time before it becomes effective.15.        In the meantime the Balkans offers a fairlyeasy prey.    Already a great deal of invaluablematerial is being obtained from Balkan countries -

wheat, maize, metals,  timber,  and above all oil from Roumania in exchange for manufactured goods and es:s cially war material looted from or manufactured in Czecho-Slovai-cia and Poland,      Roumania, however,has prohibited the exportation of aviation spirit and does not export much lubricating oil, which Germanysorely needs.      Germany is seeking to make good herdeficiencies from the Caucasian oil fields,  andtransport arrangements are being rapidly organised fromBatoum to Odessa, Constanza, Sulina and Varna,  and thenceby rail or by the Danube to Germany,      The presentbottle-heck for imported oil supplies is transport, butGermany has in hand a great constructive programme ofrailway rolling stock (including oil trucks designedto run on both the German and Russian gauges),  tugs,motor lighters, barges, etc    We have a programme ofopportunist measures for slowing down these communications and the Royal Marine Operation may beapplied in the Danubian region at the appropriate moment, but we can hardly hope permanently to interruptthem.      It would,  indeed, be unwise to attempt this atpresent, as it would probably precipitate the verycatastrophe we wish to avoid, namely, a German invasion of the BalkansOur policy,  therefore,  is to stopas much oil as we can without precipitating a crisis.We are also engaged in completing the plans and preparations for destroying the oil fields so thatthey oan be put in operation at short notice in anemergency.     There are other equally drastic measureswhich might be examined in conjunction with the French,but their effect on neutrals has to be considered.All these, however,  are rather in the nature of palliativeand the situation will never be satisfactory until theAllies can enter and command the Black Sea and offer the

hope of military assistance to Roumania in the event of attack.16.       Meanwhile the latest news indicates strong effortsby Germany to obtain her needs without fighting.   Theestablishment of a pro-German Ministry or even the inclusionof a few &quot;Iron Guard&apos; Ministers in the Roumanian government might soon put a stop to all our efforts to prevent thefull exploitation of Roumania by Germany.      In Jugo-olaviaand Hungary also Germany may be seeking to achieve apredominant position with Mussolini&apos;s connivance withoutfighting.17.       Nevertheless, now that Germany is relieved of herpreoccupations over Scandinavia it is by no means improbable,especially if she fails to accomplish her aims by diplomacyand threats,  that she may decide on a campaign designed toensure an occupation of the Roumanian oil fields so as toremove soon,  and once and for- all, her anxieties as to oil supplies.      For only by these means can she free herselfto some extent from her dependence on Russia and ensureher ability without undue anxiety to maintain a sustainedmilitary campaign against the Western Powers, without which even she can hardly hope for a decisive victory.18.       Moreover, the over-running of the Balkansno less than Holland, following on the collapse off inland, would be a moral disaster of the firstmagnitude for the Allies.19..       3o far, we have felt constrained to confineour plans to giving help to Turkey in the defence ofthe frontiers of Thrace.     One defect of this plan is that an enemy in occupation of Bulgaria would be within striking distance by air of our sea

communications with, the Dardanelles and Smyrna - evenmore So if he had penetrated to Greece.      The French,however, are understood to have ideas for aiding Jugo-Slavia from Salonica, with a view to holding up a german advance through that country towards the Mediterranean on some line further north.20.      - In the last war there was a perpetual dispute between the British and French General Staffs,  and to anonly slightly less extent between the two Governments, onthe subject of our joint policy in the Balkans, whichpersisted up to the end of the war.      Even the finaladvance in September,  1918,  (which proved one of the decisive factors in victory &quot;&quot;) was opposed at first byField-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson,      We must try to avoidsimilar differences of opinion in the- present war.21.       From the above notes it will be seen that theimportance of the Balkans,  the Black Sea and the approachesthereto,  is ever looming larger on the war horizon.Whatever may be the correct strategy in the Balkans,politically and morally it would be a very grave disasterif Jugo-Slavia and Roumania, or either of them, were over-run without our making any serious effort to avertit.      We ought at least,  in concert with the French, to study&apos;whether we have, or at some later date will have,sufficient force to enable us to induce Turkey and greece,  and if possible Bulgaria,  in their own interests to treat Jugo-Slavia and Roumania as their first line ofdefence-, so that these countries arc not allowed tosuccumb to the enemy without serious fighting.      the balkan States,  if left to themselves, will probably beovershelmed in detail one by one.      Collectively, and in combination in countries with such poor communications,they might be able to put up a step by step defences Ludendorff.     My War Memories 1914-18.Vol.II, page 729.

and even to hold up the enemy at some point.     But theywill never do this unless they are actively sustained bythe presence of Allied and Turkish forces. .   Without thatthey will just share the fate of Poland and Finland.Italian neutrality is, of course, essential to this possi-bility.      If Italy becomes hostile nothing can be dono   ,until she is defeated.      Access to the Black Sea is equallyessential to any plans of this kind and here Turkey willbe difficult,Suggested Policy, and Preparation..22,        To meet the situation summarised above thefollowing policy is suggested:-(1)       Our general policy for the present should beto continue static warfare until our militaryand air forces have reached a stage of pre-paration enabling us to adopt a more activerole.      For the time being our offensiveefforts must be limited to the Royal marine operation and naval and. air operations of a secondary character, but we must be preparednot only to resist any attack by the enemy,wherever it may take place, but to replyimmediately with an appropriate counter-offensive .(2)       In the west an attack on our shipping on amore formidable scale than we have hithertoencountered is to bo expected at .any moment and is likely to be sustained for many weeks..All available met- ods are likely to beemployed - surface raider, submarines,torpedoes, magnetic and other mines,  and aircraft on a much larger scale than hitherto.(3)       Defensively those attacks must be met by theseme methods as in the past,  and if necessary by a temporary diversion of shipping from theEast Coast, even if this involves drasticdomestic measures such as further rationing of coal,  gas, electricity and petrol.Measures for the defensive arming of merchantshipping against air attack must be pushedon as rapidly as possible, including everyform of the U.P. weapon.(4)       We should concentrate our best scientists onapplying the r.D.F.to use in aircraft.(5)       Offensively tho replies to attacks on shipping are counter-offensives on tho linosof the Sylt affair and the Royal MarineOpox^ation which must bo pressed on theFrench. -

(6)       The anti-aircraft defences of ports should here-examined in the light of v;ar oxporienco,  by the appropriate Sub-Committoe (E.D.C.. )and a report should be submitted through theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to the WarCabinet through the proper channels.(7)       Our policy in respect of counter-offensive operations by the R.A.F. should be re-examined in the light of the latest Informa-tion by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee,who should submit a report to the War Cabinet.Everything possible should be done to tuneup the selected alternatives to a high stateof preparedness.(8)       A.R.P. measures generally, but especially onthe East Coast, should be tuned up to a highstate of readiness, so far as this may not already bo the case.(9)        The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee should beasked to report through the ministerial committee on Defence to the &quot;War Cabinet onthe possibility of the Allies giving some assistance to Holland if attacked, bearing that mind the   disastrous effect on our prestige if Holland is over-run.    (Thematter has been taken up by the War Cabinetsince this Report was written)..(10)       We should press on with present plans and preparations in the Near East.(11)       The possibility of persuading the Balkan states to combine,  if any of them is attacked or threatened with attack by Germany or Russia,and of bringing thorn sufficient help toprovide the necessary inducement, should bere-examined by the War Cabinet, which, afterpreliminary consideration, might remit thequestion to the Ministerial Committee on military Go-ordination and the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committoe.(12)       The possibility of putting in operation someof the major projects for interruptingDanubian traffic should be examined by theappropriate Ministers.(13)       The Supreme War Council should meet toconsider the above matters as soon as theWar cabinet has formed its own opinions.(Initialled)    H.18th March, sinse revised to 23rd March 1940.-12-w
