(40) 98.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE QUESTION OF ALLIED ASSISTANCE TO BELGIUM INTHE EVENT OF GERMAN ATTACK.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will remember that during the week-end of the 13th-14th January, when a German attack upon Belgium seemed to be imminent,certain communications were exchanged with the King of the Belgians throughthe intermediary of Sir R. Keyes. The King of the Belgians asked for certainassurances, and a reply was sent to him on the 14th January (W.M. 40, 13thConclusions, Minute 1).2. The King of the Belgians seems to have been somewhat taken aback bythe terms of our reply and also by the nature of the communications which passed between the Belgian and French Governments about the same time. I have since been in doubt whether we might not have been under some misapprehension asto what was really in King Leopold&apos;s mind when he put his enquiry to us. i therefore asked Sir R. Keyes to discuss the matter with me. A memorandumon our conversation is attached as Annex I. I have also been in correspondence with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Brussels, who shares the opinion that some misunderstanding arose during the week-end of the 14th January, which ought, ifpossible, to be dissipated.3. Sir L. Oliphant has not yet had an opportunity of discussing the matter with King Leopold, and before he does so I think an occasion should be taken to reconsider the position and to review the terms of the message which was sent toKing Leopold. Sir R. Keyes himself has suggested three small amendments inparagraphs 1, 2 and 4 of our reply (see Annex II), which he says he has reasonto believe would make the message acceptable to His Majesty, who, of course,requires it as a means of influencing his own Government. I would suggest thatthe first two of these amendments should be adopted (paragraphs 1 and 2 of our reply). I do not think we need adopt the third (paragraph 4), though we might make a slight change in the text to make it more acceptable to the King (seeparagraph 4 of revised reply in Annex II).4. There is one other point in our message which might, perhaps, bere considered at the same time. The first of the assurances asked for by the king of the Belgians was that peace negotiations should not be opened without the participation of Belgium. This does not amount in terms to more than a request that Belgium should have a seat at the peace conference, and I should have thought we might simply agree to this, and substitute a statement to this effect for the reply given to the King in paragraph 3 (i) of our message to him.5. A parallel text showing the King&apos;s message, the reply as sent to theKing, and the proposed amendments, is annexed as Annex II.10930   [20987]
d. If my colleagues agree that the message should be revised in some or all of these respects, I would propose to authorise His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at brussels, if he sees no objection, to see King Leopold and explain to him thatthere seems to have been some misunderstanding as to the interpretation whichshould have been placed on the communications exchanged during the week-endof the 13th-14th January. The misunderstanding had now been cleared up, andin consequence it was desired to make some changes in the message from thePrime Minister which had been sent to the King on the 14th January.Sir L. Oliphant would then give the King the revised message, and if. as I. expect, this were well received by His Majesty, Sir L. Oliphant should take the&apos; j opportunity of emphasising once again that the effectiveness of our aid would depend on the promptness with which an invitation was addressed to us, and onthe extent to which military arrangements had been co-ordinated beforehandbetween Belgium and the Allies.7. I feel sure that a communication on these lines, which does not involve any extension of our commitments, would go far to reassure King Leopold, andwould be likely to promote the exchange of military information which we wishto pursue with the Belgian Government. It would also, which is perhaps evenmore important, reduce any risk there may be that the Belgian Government wouldcapitulate without serious resistance, and increase any hope there may be that belgium would call for our troops before a German attack on Belgium occurred,and perhaps even in the event of a German attack on the Netherlands.8. After the proposed communication had been made to King Leopold,which would be, in form, a message to him from the Prime Minister, it wouldbe advisable to inform M. Daladier personally and confidentially of what hadtaken place. It will be recalled that the French were inclined to think that ourearlier answer to the King of the Belgians had been rather sharp in tone.H.March 12, 1940.ANNEX I.Memorandum on Conversation between Lord Halifax and Sir Roger Keyes.SIR ROGER KEYES called on the 21st February at my request in orderto review what had passed between him and the King of the Belgians at theirinterviews on the 13th and 14th January last.2. I said that the point which I was anxious to clear up was whetherthe King of the Belgians, in asking the Prime Minister to give the three undter-takings which Sir Roger had communicated through the Eirst Lord of theAdmiralty, had it in mind to invite French and British troops into Belgiumbefore the actual invasion of Belgian territory by Germany.3. I showed Sir R. Keyes the text of the communication which had beenreceived from him, in the form in which it was communicated to the War Cabinetby the First Lord on the 14th January.   This text was as follows :  &quot; Sir Roger Keyes telephoned from British G.H.Q. in France to methis morning that the King of the Belgians asked whether the BritishGovernment would agree to the following conditions :  &quot; (1) Pas d&apos;ouverture de la negociation pour la paix sans la participa-tion.de la Belgique.&quot; (2) Garanties &quot;ae--.la restauration integrate du status politique etterritorial, ainsi que les Colonies.&quot; (3) Assistance pour la restauration economique et financiere de laBelgique.&quot; If these were promised Sir Roger thought that the King would beable to persuade his Ministers to invite French and British troops into belgium at once.&quot;
4. I said that the War Cabinet had understood this to mean that in returnfor a favourable answer to these questions the King of the Belgians would try to persuade his Government to agree to invite French and British troops toenter Belgium in advance of an actual invasion.5. Sir Roger said that he was quite clear in his mind that this was notKing Leopold&apos;s intention. What the King had asked was that the PrimeMinister should now Undertake that, if Belgium should become involved in thewar between Germany and the Allies, Belgium should receive guarantees fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government similar to those given to King Albert in 1914, namely,those described in the three points quoted above. It was in the King&apos;s mind that if the Prime Minister would give such an undertaking now, it would be easier for him to persuade his Ministers to make an immediate appeal forassistance to Great Britain and France in the event of Belgium being invadedor Belgian neutrality being threatened.6. Sir Roger admitted that the communication, as made to the War Cabinet,was open to the misunderstanding which had, in fact, occurred. The last paragraph of the communication was an expression of his own opinion, namely,that if the Prime Minister gave the three promises asked for, the King mightbe able to persuade his Government to invite French and British troops into belgium at once. It was important to remember that when this conversation between himself and the King took place, the Belgians were in possession of theGerman plan of action and there was an immense concentration of german troops on the frontier. The King fully expected that Belgium would be invaded&apos;he next morning, and it was this fact which, in Sir Roger&apos;s opinion, made it likely that Belgium might, if the three undertakings were given, make an-umediate appeal for assistance.7. Sir Roger said that he had sent a letter to the King of the Belgiansbriefly recording what had passed between the King and himself and the action he had taken on His Majesty&apos;s communication, and that he also proposed to urgeupon the King, in a personal letter, the desirability of Belgium making an appeal for assistance to Great Britain and France as soon as the Netherlands frontiershould be violated. He showed me a draft of this, and I said that I saw noobjection to it, provided that the letter was a purely personal one.8. Sir R. Keyes later said that the message which he had, on the instruc-tions of His Majesty&apos;s Government, delivered to the King of the Belgians in replyto His Majesty&apos;s request for assurances had not commended itself to HisMajesty, since he thought that the acceptance of its terms would at once involveBelgium in the war. From the conversation he had with the King, however, hewas convinced that, with three simple amendments (see Annex II), the replycould be made acceptable to His Majesty. Sir Roger would recommend that thisrevised version of the reply should now be communicated to the King in substi-tution for the earlier text.^ 9. The question also arose of the possibility of a further visit by Sir Rogerto Ueigium. Sir Roger said that he would, of course, be at the disposal of HisMajesty&apos;s Government if they thought such a visit by him would be useful; buthe thought that, in view of the embarrassment which had arisen out of his previous visit and of the undesirable comment that might be aroused by a furthervisit, it would be wiser for him to wait until he received an invitation from theKing. He begged, however, that no suggestion should be made to the BelgianGovernment through official channels that they should ask for assistance from great Britain and France as soon as Netherlands neutrality should be violated.His object in writing to the King of the Belgians on this subject, as stated inparagraph 7 above, was to try, if possible, to secure that a suggestion to this effect should come from the Belgian Government itself through official channels.10. I said that I was disposed to agree that it would be best that Sir Rogershould not visit Belgium again for the present, but I would bear his offer in mind and would call on him if occasion arose.H.Foreign Office, March 9, 1940.
ANNEX II.Message; from the King of the belgians.Sir Roger Keyes telephonedfrom British G.H.Q. in france to me this morning that theKing of the Belgians askedwhether the British Governmentwould agree to the following conditions :  (i) No opening of negotiationsfor peace without the participa-tion of Belgium.(ii) Guarantees of completepolitical and territorial restora-tion (sc. of Belgium) as well as of the colonies.(iii) Assistance for the econo-mic and financial restoration ofBelgium.If these were promised, sir roger thought that the Kingwould be able to persuade his ministers to invite French andBritish troops into Belgium atonce.Reply sent to the King of the belgians.
