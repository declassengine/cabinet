LEAFLET DROPPING. OVER, GERMANY ,The Nazi1 Authorities are taking a very serious view ofthe RpAoPo flights over German -towns for the following reasons :-lo      The Chiefs of the German Air Force from Goering down-wards have on many occasions publicly declared that enemy aircraft would he unable to fly over Germany on a large scale from theWest,      They admitted that it would he difficult to stop air raids from the Last,,      This alleged danger of air attacks fromthe East played an important part in popularising the annexationof Czechos?!.ovakic. and the attack on Poland.-      Germany was to he made safe from air attacks t-      This propaganda was widely distributed by she usual Nazi channels- the Ministry of Propaganda,The Political Organisation:,  the SoAtf, H0J0, Bo d* Mo, Arbeits-front, et;cv      It was entirely believed not only by the general public hut,  what is more important, by the party organisationsthemselves,.      The otherwise &quot;by no means universally popularannexation of Czechoslovakia and the attack on Poland wereexcused by the vast majority of Germans because they removed thedanger of air raids on German towns..      When Poland collapsed a sign of relief.went up all over Eastern and Central Germany, thedanger of air raids was ever and German citizens could sleep inpeace.arc rapidly destroying this sense of security and at the same timethe blind faith of the German masses in the military superiority in the axr of the Third Reicho      The German Air Ministry and with it the Nazi regime are losing face.,      At the same time one ofthe main reasons for Nazi action against Czechoslovakia and Polandis being shown up as an illusion,,      This is an important political point,.      It demonstrates that the Nazi contention thatthese actions were defensive is at least partly untrue,      germany is not safe from air attacks by the destruction of these countries.The frequent air raidraids over the greater part of Germany

C% V F*o^ (;:So      Tho question whether tho Rc-AoFo flights are to heopposed serlooisly or not is &quot;becoming acute      It is a knottyproblem for Goering to solve,      As Minister for Air he naturallywishes to take up the challenge of the R0A0F0  and to restore the prestige of the Air Forceu     As Economic Dictator he wishes toavoid anything that might dislocate the already overstrainedGerman industrial organisation.^     Air battles over important industrial centres mean a serious loss of time, they are noisyand exciting and interfere with the much needed rest of over-strained workersoWithin the N0SPDo-A.jP0    the National Socialist Party,opinions are divided on this question,.-      Leaders of variousorganisations are engaged in heated controversies.,  an undesirable state of affairs?Leaders of the H0J\.   (Hitler Jugend) are in favour of strong actions      They contend that the passive submission tothis impudent British challenge is undermining the morale of theyoung generation,.      They have been instructed to tell theirboys and girls that the present passivity is a trap to giveBritish airmen a false sense of security and that one fine day the whole British bombing force will be annihilated0      Thispropaganda is beginning to lose its effectiveness^SoAo leaders take the same view..:      The SoAo hasalways been the &quot;Sorgenkind&quot; of the Nazis., especially since theRoehm affair0      Their real ralson d:etre disappeared when the nazis came Into power and street battles became unnecessary,Jew&apos;baiting has now lost its point and there is little left forthem to doo      They are extremely jealous of the S.S, and feelthat they have been given a raw deaio      They are thus moreinclined to criticise than any other party organisation.They have never forgiven Goering for the part he played in theRoehm affair and in the rank arid file of the SaAc much criticism is heard of the &quot;Schlappheit53 of the German Air/Force&apos;s

Force1s attitude vis-a-vis the ReA0P, raids.The Gestapo was until recently opposed to strongaction.     As long as the British machines flew peacefully overGerman towns at great altitudes they did not do much damage to german morale for the simple reason that their presence wasignored.      Since the R.A0F0 have, however, taken to distributingleaflets on a large scale, since above all they have &quot;begun toadvertise their presence by flares and lights - which is anunmitigated &quot;Schweinerei&quot; - the Gestapo is reconsidering thesituation.      HEYDRICHj  second in command to HIMMLER, recentlystated to Alfred that these air raids presented the Gestapo witha very difficult problem, that they had not yet made up their minds which would do more harm, action or passivity.The arbeitsfront, leading industrialists and others concerned with industries, commerce and transport are opposed to action.      The Nazi Medical Association is opposed to action.They contend that the nervous strain imposed on German workersduring the last three or four years and especially since theoutbreak of the war makes any not absolutely unavoidablemeasures undesirable which would add to this strain.      The last few months with their abnormal weather conditions haveaggravated the prevailing ne\u,asthenia amongst workers03*     The leaflets dropped by the R.A.F. are a serious problem.      It is against human nature and especially against german nature not to read a printed piece of paper.      You canconvict a man if he deliberately listens to foreign broadcasts,you cannot send a man to a concentration camp if he tells youwith righteous indignation (mit dem Brustton der Uberzeugung):&quot;I felt it my duty to remove this rubbish;    I do not want mychildren to be poisoned.&quot;     This is the excuse which withvariations has been given on many occasions when civilians wereaccused of having picked up these leaflets.      After several years&apos; experience of Gestapo rule there is hardly a Germanstupid enough to take leaflets home and keep them.      They are/read

^ce-aoU-and promptly destroyed.One of the problems facing the Nazi authorities indealing with these leaflets is the obvious necessity to collectand destroy them with the least possible delay0      This necessi-tates the employment of a large number of people on the  nob ofcleaning up*      Parks, private gardens, etc., must be carefullysearched.-.      The police and S0Sffl  cannot cope with the leafletsalone and a host of S?A0 men, Blockwarte, Hauswarte,Zellenleiter and other small fry of the party organisation hasto be employed on this work.      The Gestapo have discoveredthat these people are incapable of keeping their mouths shutFthey and their wives have discussed the contents of the leafletswith friends and neighboursaAn incident at the Wedding causes the Berlin policeserious anxiety*      The Wedding, a working class clan district,was formerly a stronghold of the Communists,,      A group of localSaAo men in uniform were drinking in a Bierstube0      One of themen produced a tract which was openly discussed in quite a friendly spirit and it was admitted that the Englander wereafter all &quot;feirie Hunde&quot;.      (This sounds uncomplimentary but is actually a term of approval and admiration in the Berlinerischjargon),,      They also made disparaging remarks on &quot;Hermann&quot;.The scandalised landlord rang up the police and then remonstratedwith the men,;,     When the police arrived the landlord, was badlyknocked about and the S.A. men resisted arrest0      It is feared that this incident has had a bad effect on the rather turbulentSaAo formations in eastern Berlin.There has been fairly serious trouble In a working class district of Vienna after the R,A.F* dropped leaflets,No details are available-,40      There is a special psychological reason why the Nazisparticularly dislike the R8A.F. flights over Berlin apart fromthe indignity of having the capital bombarded with enemy tracts.The Berliner unlike most Germans has a strong,  if somewhat/ sardonic,

5, ...       ^II&apos;sardonic, sense of humour0     He cannot help seeing the humorousside of enemy airmen indulging in an aerial &quot;Bummel&quot; up and down the Unter den Linden and Kurfurstendamm.     The Berliners alsorealise that the British machines are a long way from their base and there is nothing the Berliner likes more than courage,Amused admiration does not go with contemptuous hatred, and it isthe latter which Goebbels is trying to propagates      Thus theR.APF,  is not only making Goering lose&apos; face, but Goebbels aswell who is once more shown up as a liarcIn view of the above it is thought likely in informedNazi quarters that in future there will be a strong Germanreaction to these RCAVF0 raids,      This opinion is, however,merely intelligent anticipation;    it is not based on any statement made by Hitler or Goering^22nd March,  1940,
