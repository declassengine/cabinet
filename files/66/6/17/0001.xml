this document is the property of his britannic majestvs government g ^TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.W.P. (40)87.7TH MARQHj, 1940. COPY NO&quot;/&quot;&quot; &apos;WAR CABINET.ASSISTANCE TO FINLAND,Draft Telegram to H.M. Minister atHelsinki.(Circulated by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs).1. His Liajesty&apos;s Government cannot indefinitelycontinue to hold in readiness men, material, transportsetc., which are urgently required elsewhere and it istherefore of utmost importance that we should know atearliest possible moment what is decision of finnish government in regard to assistance from Allied Governments,2. It would seem that there are three possible courses open to the Finnish Government.(a) to make formal appeal for help of allied military forces;(b) not to ask for armed forces but to rely onsupnly of further material, especiallybombers;(c) to negotiate with Soviet Government.3. If they choose first alternative, they alreadyknow the position, i.e.   that we are prepared to send a force,, tsut that Scandinavian Governments refuse to allowpassage.      Though we should of course put all possiblepressure on these Governments, and though the latter might

not offer forcible resistance, we should, have to reckonwith measures of sabotage etc., which would render passageof troops impossible.4. If they choose the second alternative, HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be prepared, notwithstandingdifficulties already indicated in my telegram No. ,to send bombers immediately, and to supply such other material as may be available.      Particulars would follow.5. If they choose third alternative, question ofassistance would obviously have to be reconsidered in light of developments.6. In the event of Finnish Government choosing eithersecond or third alternative, we shall take it thatexpedition of troops to Scandinavia is no longer required,and we shall proceed to employ for other purposes forces now held available for Finland and Scandinavia.7. Please press Finnish Government for reply most urgently.Foreign Office, S.W.1.7th March, 1940.
