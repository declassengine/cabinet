THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No. iW.P. (44) 681.23rd November, 1944.WAR CABINET.New Zealand-Australia Conference.SOUTH SEAS REGIONAL COMMISSION.Memorandum by the Secretaries of State for Dominion Affairs and forthe Colonies.WE circulate as Annexes I and II copies of telegrams from Australia andNew Zealand recommending the establishment of a South Seas Regional Corn-mission. The proposals in these telegrams are in general conformity with thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom in regard to regional commissions, but we feel that they must be viewed in relation to the widerproblem of international supervision and inspection advocated by the twoDominion Governments in separate telegrams circulated in W.P. (44) 677.If the policy of Regional Commissions is to be successful, these Commissionsmust be based on the principle of mutual collaboration in the solution of commonproblems, and the introduction of any principle of supervision would, in ouropinion, gravely prejudice the successful working of a Regional Commission.The annexed telegrams regarding the proposed South Seas Regional Commissiondo not themselves suggest the grant of any powers of supervision or inspectionto the Regional Commission but this is presumably because the two Governmentscontemplate that such functions should be -discharged by a separate international body.2. While, therefore, the suggestions for the establishment of a South SeasRegional Commission are satisfactory as they stand, we think it desirable toavoid committing His -Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom definatly to participating in such a scheme until the wider question of international supervision and inspection has been satisfactorily settled. Reference has alreadybeen made in the telegrams exchanged with the two Dominion Governments*to a memorandum which is being prepared on the international aspects of colonial policy generally, for eventual exchange with the United States Government.This draft is not yet complete but will be submitted in the near future by theSecretary of State for the Colonies to the Armistice and Post-War committee as a preliminary to submission to the War Cabinet itself. It is proposed thatthe document should be sent to. all Dominion Governments before it is com-municated to the United States Government and it seems desirable that a definiteexpression of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom in regard to the proposed South Seas Regional Commission should be deferred until the Governments of Australia and New Zealand have had an opportunityof considering the proposals in this memorandum.3. We accordingly circulate for consideration of the War Cabinet, thedraft (Annex III) of a reply on these lines to the telegrams at Annexes I and II.C.O. S.23rd November, 1944.* See W. P. (44) 641.[28675]
ANNEX I.Telegram No. 301 of 13th November, 1944, from Commonwealth Government.(No. 301.   Secret.)South Seas Regional Commission.1. It will be recalled that in January last we raised with you the questionof the establishment of a South Seas Regional Commission, when you intimatedyour willingness to exchanging views on the proposal, and your desire that weshould consult with you before approaching any other country. We have now given further consideration to articles 30 and 31 of the Australian-New ZealandAgreement, and feel that immediate steps should be taken to establish theCommission. With this end in view we would appreciate an early expression ofyour views as to the general framework of the Commission, and the manner and timing of an approach to the other Governments concerned,2. Statements of the Colonial Secretary, and discussions at the meeting of prime Ministers, made it clear Ave believe that there is agreement on the general principles of Regional Commissions, namely that they should be advisory bodiesset up by the Governments with interests in the region, as Colonel Stanley stated,to &quot; provide effective and permanent machinery for consultation and collabora-tion, so that the States concerned might work together to promote the well-being of the Colonial territories.&quot; As advisory welfare bodies they would have nofunctions involving supervision or security.3.   We propose the Commission might take the following general form : (a) The Commission proper, consisting of representatives of the Govern-ments and administrations in the region;(b) A Secretariat;(c) Research and functional bodies established by the member Governments. * on the advice of the Commission.Provision should be made for associating with the work of the Commissionexisting research and functional bodies. In appropriate cases the member governments should nominate representatives of the native peoples to take partin the work of the Commission and its agencies. In addition we consider thatthere should be held regularly a South Seas conference for the discussion ofPacific Islands problems. This conference might comprise nominees of Govern-ments represented on the Commission (these nominees to represent Administra-tions, scientific bodies, missionary bodies and native peoples) together withnominees of the international organisations interested in South Seas affairs (e.g.,the I.L.O. and the Food and Agriculture Organisation).4. These ideas are expressed in general terms as we desire to have the viewsof the United Kingdom Government on this proposal. Nearly all of the regionfor which the Commission is proposed is now outside the area of military opera-tions, and we feel that much is to be gained politically as well as from the standpoint of native welfare, by proceeding rapidly with the establishment of theCommission.We would consider early 1945 as a target date for the establishment of such aCommission, and would welcome an expression of the views of the UnitedKingdom Government as a first step in convening a conference of interestedcountries.ANNEX II.Telegram No. 298 of 15th November, 1944, from New Zealand Government.(No. 298.   Secret.)South Seas Regional Commission.It will be recalled that in January last Australia and New Zealand raised the question of the establishment of the South Seas Regional Commission, when you intimated your willingness to exchange views on the proposal and your desire that the two Governments should consult with you before approaching any other country.
3i2. Further consideration was given at the recent Conference at Wellingtonto Articles 30 and 31 of the Australian-New Zealand Agreement, and the twoGovernments &quot;feel that immediate steps should be taken to establish the Commis-sion. With this end in view we would appreciate an early expression of your views as to the general framework of the Commission and the manner and timing of an approach to the other Governments concerned.3. Statements of the Colonial Secretary, and discussion at the meeting of prime Ministers, made it clear, we believe, that there is agreement on the general principles&apos;of Regional Commissions, namely that they should be advisory bodiesset up by the Governments with interests in the region, as Colonel Stanley stated,to &quot;provide effective and permanent machinery for consultation and collabora-tion, so that the States concerned might work together to promote the well-being ofthe Colonial Territories.&quot; As advisory welfare bodies they would have nofunctions involving supervision or security.4. The Commission might take the following general form : (A) the Corn-mission proper, consisting of representatives of the Governments and Administra-tions in the region; (B) a secretariat; (C) research and functional bodiesestablished by the member Governments on the advice of the Commission.5. Provision should be made for associating with the work of the Commis-sion existing research and functional bodies.6. In appropriate cases the member Governments could nominate repre-sentatives of the native peoples to take part in the work of the Commission andits agencies.7. In addition, it is considered that there should be held regularly a SouthSeas Conference for the discussion of Pacific Islands problems. This conference might comprise nominees of Governments represented on the Commission (thesenominees to represent Administrations, scientific bodies, missionary bodies andnative peoples), together with nominees of international organisations interestedin South Seas affairs (e.g., the I.L.O. and the Food and Agriculture Organisation).8. These ideas are expressed in general terms, as we desire to have thoseof the United Kingdom Government on this proposal. Nearly all of the region,for which the Commission is proposed, is now outside the area of militaryoperations, and we feel that much is to be gained politically, as well as fromthe standpoint of native welfare, by proceeding with the establishment of sucha Commission.9. We would welcome the expression of the views of the United KingdomGovernment as a first step in arranging for the convening of a Conference of interested countries which, it is considered, should be held early in 1945.ANNEX III.Draft telegram to Australian and Neiv Zealand Governments.Reference : Canberra telegram No. 301, Wellington telegram No. 298.(Secret.)South Seas Regional Commission.In principle we are in agreement with your proposals for the establishmentof a South Seas Regional Commission which in general are in conformity withthe policy adumbrated by the Colonial Secretary in July last year. This is,indeed, one of the areas which we had always had in contemplation for the setting up of such a Commission.But we feel that these proposals must be viewed in relation to the widerquestion of international co-operation in Colonial policy.   We have telegraphedto you separately (my telegram No.......*) regarding your proposals for creating a central international body with powers of supervision and inspection. In ourview, if the policy of regional commissions is to be successful, these commissions/ must be based on the principle of mutual collaboration in the solution ofcommon problems. The introduction of any principle of supervision, whether bycreation of a central international body as suggested by your Governments orm some other manner, would, in our opinion, gravely prejudice the successful* Annex II to W. P. (44) 677.
working of regional commissions generally. Moreover, before progress can bemade in this matter, it will be necessary to approach the United States Govern-ment. In our view it would be desirable that, in approaching them, we shouldbe in a position to explain fully our general scheme for international co-operation in Colonial policy and, indeed, it is unlikely that they would agree to participate in a regional scheme in advance of such general consultation.   As shown in our telegram No.......* we hope shortly to telegraph to you details of our plans and thereafter to consider with you the next step.In the circumstances it seems inevitable that these further consultations should take place before progress can be made with the establishment of a South.Seas Regional Commission.* Annex II to W. P. (44) 677.
