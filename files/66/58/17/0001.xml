SECRET. Copy No.2 gW.P. (44) 667.21st November, 1944.WAR CABINET.VOTING AT WORLD ORGANISATION.Note by the Prime Minister.MY colleagues may be interested to read the accompanying note prepared at my request by the Minister of Aircraft Production, to which is annexed aletter of comment from the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.W. S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W.1.21st November, 1944.Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1944. r/.A,

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT^I.JSfOTE BY THE MINISTER OF AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION.THE question here raised is as to the voting in the &quot; Security Council.&quot;2. This Council will consist of eleven members with (ultimately) fivepermanent seats, i.e., United States, U.S.S.R., Great. Britain, China and (indue course) France.The Council is to act on behalf of the members of the Organisation, and inaccordance with the principles and purposes of the Organisation.All members of the Organisation obligate themselves to accept the decisionsof the Security Council and to act in accordance with the provisions of the charter.3. It is important therefore to see exactly what are the functions of the&quot; Security Council &quot; laid down in Chapter VIII.   These are as follows : (a) To investigate any dispute or situation which may lead to internationalfriction or give rise to a dispute, in order to determine whether its continuance is likely to endanger the maintenance of peace and security.  &apos;(N-B. The decision here is as to whether the continuance of thesituation is likely to endanger peace. This is a matter of opinion and not of facts.)Any member of the Organisation can bring such a question to theSecurity Council.(b) To call upon the members to such a dispute to settle it amicably.(c) If they fail to settle amicably, to decide whether a continuance of thedispute endangers peace and, if so, whether to take action.(d) If it so decides, to recommend appropriate procedures and methods of.adjustment.(e) The Security Council can refer &quot; justiciable disputes &quot; to the Inter-national Court of Justice.(/) If by the above methods there is a failure to settle the dispute and theSecurity Council decide that such failure still threatens the peace,then it is empowered to determine what diplomatic, economic or other measures (short of using force) are to be employed.(g) If the Security Council decide that such measures are inadequate itcan use force.4. The question arises therefore as to whether the permanent members ofthe Security Council should be permitted to vote in decisions concerning theirown conduct, that is in cases in which they are one of the parties concerned.It is already provided (Chapter VI (D) (4)) that any member can participate in the discussion, whether a party concerned or not.The aim is to obtain a workable system which cannot be defeated by a minority consisting of a wrong-doer.5. In national matters we have not been able to devise any form of tribunal to settle political and economic differences except the High Court of Parliament,which is accepted because it is fluid in membership and represents all the people.Even so it is almost an accepted principle of Parliamentary democracy that no party can go too far in exerting its will on the opposing minority. In facta large measure of compromise is an essential factor and distinguishes evolu-tionary policy from revolutionary policy.In the international field we certainly have not developed so far as in theNational field, nor have we any such body as an international democraticallyelected Parliament.We are dealing with Governments with strong national bias and pride andit seems impracticable to try and apply majority rule internationally in the same way that we have sought to apply it nationally.How far we are from such a possibility is illustrated by &apos;&apos; mixed &apos;&apos; casessuch as India, v/here the problems are inter-religious as well as internal. Even[28460]
in such cases simple majority rule has proved impossible because there is not asufficient, homogeneity in the population. This applies very much more strongly to the case we are considering.6. As a*practical matter in the Security Council consent of all the five majorparties to accept the decision is essential. That does not mean necessarily thatthey will all agree as to it being right, but it means that they must give their consent to the action arising out of the decision when taken.I think one can say quite definitely that in our Parliament the minoritywould never consent unless they had the opportunity both of expressing theiropinion and voting on all issues.   If their right to vote were to be taken away      )they would certainly resist the decisions taken.The best chance in the international Security Council of attaining thatabsolutely vital consent to its decisions is to give all the members the right to vote,even when their own conduct may be called in question.7. It is no good trying to assimilate the Security Council in its procedure to a judicial body.  It is not a judicial body, it is a political body.This is clear from the decisions which it has to take, i.e., to determine whether a dispute is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace.This is not a judicial decision. It is a question of opinion and dependsalmost entirely on political considerations.If once it is realised that the Security Council is a political and not a judicialbody, all the difficulties disappear, and it is perfectly natural that all those presentshould have the right to vote, and it is largely from that right to vote that thepossibility of consent will come.8. I have set out these rather general considerations as I thought they might help in your approach to the problem.I realise they are not what you asked me for, but I now give you someexamples of the effect which might ensue if parties interested were not allowedto vote.9. Perhaps I should make clear that &quot; interested parties &quot; is, of course, avery vague phrase and might include those indirectly interested as well as thosedirectly interested.To illustrate this, assume, as is very likely, that the U.S.S.R. has a treatyof mutual support with Roumania; Roumania has a dispute with Hungary; ifwar breaks out between Roumania and Hungary the U.S.S.R. is obligated tosupport Roumania. Is the U.S.S.R. an interested party? Clearly it is. But thismeans an examination of the treaty obligations of all countries before it can bedecided whether they are interested parties.I should rather think that the United States would be an interested partyin any South American matter, just as we should be in the case of Egypt or Iraq.If this interpretation of &quot; interested party &quot; is the right one, it enormouslyincreases the number of disputes from which one or more of the major powers would be excluded. And yet, if they were not to be considered as &quot; interested parties &apos;&apos; in such cases, it would enable them always to act through some smallsatellite Power, although all the world realised that it was the major Powerthat was really concerned. I must therefore take the wider definition of&quot; interest &quot; rather than the strictly technical and narrow one.10.   Here are some cases that might quite well occur. * -(i) We have a dispute with the United States over the Caribbean bases not unlike the Alaska dispute any other Power can refer it to theSecurity Council.They have to decide whether it threatens world peace. Neither GreatBritain or United States can vote. The U.S.S.R. and China are thetwo major Powers to decide, until France has come in.(ii) A dispute takes place as to whether Hong-Kong shall become aninternational base in the Pacific. This is claimed by the United Statesand resisted by ourselves, China coming in as a claimant for its returnto Chinese sovereignty.Neither United States, ourselves or China can vote. The matter issettled by the U.S.S.R. as the only major Power.
(iii) The United States, U.S.S.R. and ourselves all claim rights to landaircraft in Greenland. The decision by vote remains largely in thehands of China.(iv) There is a dispute as to the control of the Mediterranean between ourselves, France, United States and U.S.S.E., especially with relationto Gibraltar, Malta, Suez and Constantinople. The matter remains tobe voted on by China and other smaller Powers.(v) The U.S.S.R., China and ourselves all claim rights to land aircraft inHonolulu. The decision by vote would rest entirely with France andthe smaller Powers.11. These examples illustrate the impossibility of dealing with an inter-national political body as if it were a common jury in the trial of a domesticissue between two individuals. In such a case it is right to be able to challengeany member of the jury who is interested and there are millions of others who can easily take his place.In the case of the Security Council there is no way by which such a challengecan be effective without disfranchising a large part of the world&apos;s population on a matter that is admittedly of the most crucial importance to the peopledisfranchised.12. I hope the above observations may make clear the fallacy of thearguments in favour of a country concerned in or interested in the dispute hothaving a right to vote.Ministry of Aircraft Production,7th October, 1944.II.Letter to the Minister of Aircraft Production from the permanent under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I am most grateful for the copy of your minute of the 7th October to thePrime Minister on Voting in the World Organisation. It has been most helpful in clearing our minds on this important subject, and you will probably like toknow our present thoughts on it.I entirely agree with you that this is a political rather than a marrowconstitutional and legal issue. We are not trying to set up a super-State whichshall decide all the issues that arise between States and provide a solution for allpossible problems that are likely to arise in the post-war world. For a long period the future peace of the world will depend on the reasonably harmoniousco-operation of the Great Powers, especially of the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates of Amerioa and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and I would addalso France, whose co-operation with us in Western Europe is almostindispensable.What the &apos;&apos; Proposals &apos;&apos; drawn up at Dumbarton Oaks try to do is to set upa centre where the policies of the different States can be harmonised and also toprovide machinery for the settlement of disputes and the prevention of violentaction if all other means of agreement fail. I hope that the machinery set.upfor this latter purpose would be rarely used even for smaller States. It is therebecause of the wide.public demand for something &quot;with teeth in it.&quot; and meanwhile the process of setting it up, especially the establishment of the MilitaryStaff Committee, should do a good deal to make all States feel that they have acommon responsibility in these questions and provide the means for them to acttogether for that purpose.I should note that our controversy with the Soviet Government is not reallywhether they and the other party to the dispute shall have a vote, both votesbeing of equal value, but whether they (but not the other party) should have have to. This is because the proposal is that for all important decisions of theCouncil unanimity of the Great Powers should be required. The question is whether this should apply when the Council is dealing with a dispute to whicha Great Power is a party.   If it does, and if the Parties vote, it is clear that
the Great Power (but not the other party) would possess a right of veto. Whatthe Soviets desire is accordingly that, if a Great Power is a party to a dispute with any other State, it should be able by its veto to prevent the security council from even taking cognisance of the dispute, and, of course, from making any recommendation or taking any action to enforce it. Other States, on thecontrary, could be made to submit their disputes to the Council, and if it foundthem in the wrong they could be forced to accept its decisions under the threat of sanctions. And all other States would be under the obligation to join in thesesanctions against the offending small State.If the Soviet have their way, therefore, we should set up two entirely different systems, one for the Great Powers which would be subject to no controlwhatever except to the extent that they may be influenced by the other Powers,and another for the smaller States which would be subjected to most drasticpenalties if they refused to act as the Council decides. It is&apos;difncult to reconcilesuch a position with the &quot;sovereign equality&quot; promised in Article 4 of the moscow Declaration.It should be further noted that it is only &quot; parties &quot; to a dispute that donot vote, not &quot; interested jjarties.&quot; Only those States actually in dispute abouta particular question would be deprived of the right of voting, not other Statesinterested. During the whole of the League&apos;s existence there was never any difficulty over this point.&apos; I agree, of course, that in some of the interesting examples which you givevery difficult situations might arise. Indeed, any dispute in which a Great power is involved and which is formally placed before the Security Council would always cause great difficulty unless the Great Power concerned had chosen thatmethod of deciding the dispute, e.g., as we did in our dispute with Turkeyover Mosul, to our great advantage, and in our dispute with Persia about Anglo-Persian oil. But we must rely on the reasonable discretion and commonsensein the Great Powers and on their sense of the&apos; necessity of unanimity amongstthemIn saying this I do not mean to imply that we are not reconsidering thewhole question of the position of the Great Powers in the Organisation andthat there is not a great deal to be said for the Soviet view that, since a great power cannot be coerced without a major war which would obviously wreckthe Organisation, there should be no provision for inflicting sanctions upon it.But whatever form is ultimately adopted it will be of no avail unless there is a real will amongst the Great Powers to work harmoniously together. If the sufferings and dangers of our times have not produced this common outlookcertainly nothing else will do so.I am sending a copy of this letter to the Prime Minister.Foreign Office, 30th October, 1944.
