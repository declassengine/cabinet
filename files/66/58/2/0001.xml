THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &quot;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 652.15th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.DISTRIBUTION OF INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal and the Minister of Information.IN his paper W.P. (44) 640, the President of the Board of Trade puts forward proposals for legislation to implement Government policy on theDistribution of Industry as laid down in paragraphs 26-30 of the White paper on Employment Policy.In certain important particulars Dr. Dalton gives an unjustified interpreta-tion of the White Paper proposals.1. He proposes to extend the Governments powers to build factories so thatthey will apply not to the Development Areas (as the White Paper laid down)but to the country in general. This would be an unwarrantable departure fromagreed policy and might be exercised to defeat the social purpose for which theDevelopment Areas are delimited.2. He proposes to take power by legislation to compel industrialists to notify the Board of Trade of any contemplated change in the industrial use ofexisting premises. Such notification is, presumably, to enable the Governmentto extend to such a change of use, the power of prohibition which it proposes totake over establishment of new factories deemed to be disadvantageous.But the extension of the Governments veto from contemplated neivindustrial development to the altered use of existing industrial capacity wouldbe an unwise and improper interference with the conduct of business.It could not be defended as reasonably inherent in the White Paper.3.   Dr.   Dalton  further  proposes  that  Government  grants  should  be .employed to promote the full development of basic services in the development areas.   This again is an extension of the terms of the White Paper, whichrecited simply that the Government should  &quot; take such action as may benecessary to secure the full development of the basic services.&quot;It is essential that a direct financial commitment by the Government forthese purposes should be specifically limited to the provision of services such asfall outside the province of free enterprise.4. Dr. Dalton proposes a special scheme to provide Government finance bygrants-in-aid for firms willing to establish themselves in the Development Areas.The White Paper confined itself to the declaration that the Government will takethe necessary steps to secure that such enterprises have adequate facilities toobtain loan and share capital.It is important that industries set up in the Development Areas should behealthy and vigorous. They must therefore be able to commend themselves to existing financial institutions, which have ample resources and vast experience.B.B. B.15th November, 1944.[28619]
