THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&apos;   Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 664.21st November, 1944.WAR CABINET.STREET LIGHTING IN LONDON.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Ministry of Home Security.I have considered this question again, after the discussion in the WarCabinet on the 15th November (WM. (44) 150th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. I propose, in view of the latest appreciation (W.P. (44) 600), to withdraw the requirement that complete black-out must replace the dim-out on an alert.To distinguish between piloted and non-piloted raids by different systems ofalert is, I fear, impracticable, owing to the mechanics of the siren system. Thesiren can only make two noises, the alert and the all clear. In London region and in most towns in South-East England sirens are operated on an automaticsystem which can only give a one-minute alert, or, even with alteration, a fixed period alert; people in these places hear two or more sirens not exactlysynchronised. Two alerts, with an interval of half a minute to allow the wailto die away, would take two and a half minutes, plus a further delay while thepublic acted on the warning and covered their lights. Therefore, either the double alert would have to be given at long range and over an unnecessarily wide area, or the first plane would be able to reach the target before lights wereblacked out.3. This difficulty need not be considered, however, if the Air Staff considerthat the requirement of complete black-out on the alert can be abolished with areasonable degree of safety. Abolition of the dim-out or the restoration of fullpre-war lighting cannot, I suggest, be considered. I understand that enemypilots would be able on clear nights to see the lights of London soon after leavingHolland, or from little south of the Wash, and so be able much more accurately to locate the points from which to launch flying bombs. Lighting must also remainrestricted in certain coastal areas, for the same reason ^s,nd for the protectiondemanded by the Admiralty. It may be necessary to reimpose the requirement to black-out if piloted raids resume.4. This relaxation will only affect the &apos;&apos; dim-out &quot; in buildings and in public service vehicles. But lighting exempted .by licence from black-out for the sake of industry and. transport is already exempt from further restriction on thealert for a flying-bomb attack. Such lighting is already extinguished only on aspecial &apos;&apos; Purple &apos;&apos; warning, communicated on the approach of piloted planes, andthe same is true of the higher standard street lighting.5. But the exemption from complete black-out should greatly encourage thosehouseholders who can provide dim-out curtains to substitute them for black-outcurtains.6. I append a report on the probable action of the principal Londonlighting authorities on the new street lighting. I am glad to see how much isbeing done they are coming along; but I must warn my colleagues that I stilldo not believe it practicable to require the reluctant lighting authorities to spendmore money and labour on the intermediate stage between now and the time of complete relaxation. And it is the fact that, owing to stringency of labour and materials and the varied systems of lighting among the nearly 100 authorities of London Region (more than one in some boroughs), a number of the localauthorities are faced with real difficulties. A time lag is inevitable. In my[28654]
statement to the House on the 9th November I pointed out that &quot; it is not to beexpected that uniformity can be secured throughout the whole of the london area.&quot; %7. Finally, I propose (again in view of the latest appreciation(W.P. (44) 600)) that a detailed study should be made of the possibility of abolishing any black-out requirements in a large part of the country. The Deparfc-ments it would be necessary for me to consult appear to be the Admiralty, WarOffice, Air Ministry and the Ministries of War Transport, Supply, and fuel and Power.FT.
