(44) 678.23rd November, 1944.WAR CABINET.SITUATION IN PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I feel I must bring before my colleagues a number of difficult questions onwhich decisions must now be taken arising out of the murder of Lord Moyne in cairo on the 6th November.2. There is a widespread feeling in the Middle East that this shockingcrime should not be allowed to pass without some striking reaction on the partof His Majesty&apos;s Government which may serve not only to prevent furtheroutrages in the future, but also to maintain British prestige throughout that partof the world. The views of the Middle East Defence Committee, which metrecently in Cairo, are set out in a telegram of 18th November from the resident minister&apos;s Office appended as Annex I to this paper. The Ambassadors in cairo and Bagdad are in general agreement with their views. Although I discount tosome extent their view of local feeling, as it is only natural that Arabs would beglad to see the Jews hard hit, yet I do agree that, if possible, this occasion shouldbe marked by some decisive action.3. At the same time we must face the realities of the situation from thePalestine end. The authorities there want to bring the campaign of terrorismto an end as soon as possible. To this end they wish to enlist the support of thegreat mass of Palestinian Jewry. There are signs that, although there may notbe one hundred per cent, support for the Government, there is now an increasingdesire on the part of the responsible leaders to take effective action. I noticed, forexample, a recent press report that a programme of measures against terrorismwas unanimously adopted by the Zionist Council in Jerusalem on the 19thNovember. It is essential, therefore, that any action taken by us should convince the Jews of the dilemma they are in and bring pressure on them to work with us, rather than have the effect of ranging the whole of Jewry against us.4. In the light of these two considerations I have carefully considered thevarious proposals for action that have been suggested here and in the Middle East.5. (1) Immigration. It has been suggested that a warning should be givento the leaders of the Jewish community that, unless these terrorist activitiescease, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be obliged to suspend immigration into palestine. The Prime Minister decided to omit an intimation to this effect fromhis statement in the House on the 17th November because he wished me to clear up some points with the High Commissioner by telegraph. I append a copy ofthe telegram which I sent to Lord Gort at the Prime Ministers request, togetherwith a copy of Lord Gort&apos;s telegram in reply (Annexes II and III). It will beseen that the High Commissioner still feels it would be helpful if it could be impressed on Palestine Jewry that, if further outrages occur, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will be forced to take drastic action and even to divert elsewhereimmigrants destined for Palestine until more settled conditions can bere-established there. I agree with Lord Gorfs view, and I would now ask theauthority of the War Cabinet to make such a statement publicly, if possible inthe course of the debate on the Address next week.(2) Arms Searches, It has been proposed that the irregular Jewish forcesin Palestine should be disarmed and that to this end wholesale searches for arms[28671]b
throughout the country should be instituted. This suggestion was considered bythe War Cabinet on the 13th November, and in accordance with their instructionsthe military implications of the proposal have been examined. The views of theChiefs of Staff are contained in the memorandum appended as Annex IV. their conclusion briefly is that a wholesale search for arms in Palestine would entail a military commitment which could be undertaken only at the direct expense of operations against Germany. Even then the success of such a search could notbe guaranteed.On the other hand, the Middle East Defence Committee, whose views (as setI out in Annex .1) were not available when the Chiefs of Staff reported, feel that1 the issues now at stake in the Middle Eastern area are such as to justify,whatever the military consequences, the institution of wholesale arms searchesin Palestine.The High Commissioner^ view, as is shown by his telegram of the21st November Annex III is that adequate forces should be moved into palestine as soon as practicable, but that- they should not be used for wholesalearms searches there&apos;unless further outrages occur.I am not in a position to speak for the military side of this proposal; but from the point of view of administration in Palestine, I do urge that sufficienttroops should be made available, if at all possible, so that they may be at hand for immediate use should the situation further deteriorate. Even if the troops are not used, this visible sign of the power to take forcible measures could hardly fail to make a striking impression in Palestine.(3) National Registration. Lord Gort is now considering whether a systemof compulsory national registration can be introduced in Palestine.- Such asystem was in force in the Turkish regime, and a voluntary system was startedduring the 1938-39 disturbances. Administrative and political difficulties would have to be faced, but Lord Gort thinks that a system of national regis-tration would be valuable, and I should like to have the authority of the Cabinetto inform him that he is at liberty to go ahead with his arrangements if he thinks that they can be satisfactorily operated.(4) Two possible additional measures have been suggested : (a) A heavy collective fine on the whole Jewish community in Palestine.(b) Deportation of Jewish political leaders on the analogy of the action taken in the case of the Arab High Committee in 1937.There are obvious objections to both these proposals and the HighCommissioner has rejected them (paragraph 5 of his telegram of the21st November Annex III).6.   Recruitment for the Palestine Police.The Police have done an immense amount of good work in recent weeks intracking down and arresting suspected terrorists; I shall be able to give theWar Cabinet some details verbally. The Inspector-General, who has just arrivedhome to discuss the situation with me, is confident that, if the co-operation of theJewish authorities and community generally can be obtained, the Police shouldbe able to deal with the situation properly in time. But the greatest handicapis the existing shortage of man-power. I am making a number of suggestionson this to the Ministers concerned, and all of them have been most helpful. until these proposals have been further discussed they will not be in a form for submission to the Cabinet. I am sure, however, that my colleagues will agreethat these Police requirements should be regarded as of the first priority as theymay well mean the saving of men and money in other directions.7.   To sum up, I hope that the Cabinet will authorise (1) a warning to be made publicly that, if further outrages occur, HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be obliged to suspend Jewish immigration into Palestine;(2) the movement as soon as practicable of additional military forces into palestine so that they may be at hand for immediate use in connectionwith arms searches should further outrages occur; and(3) the introduction in Palestine of a system of compulsory national registration if the High Commissioner definitely recommends )this step.O.

ANNEX I.Cairo (Minister Resident&apos;s Office) to Foreign Office. (Received Vdth November)(No. 2448.)(Top Secret.) Cairo&apos;, 18th November, 1944.Following for War Cabinet represents views of Middle JEast DefenceCommittee, with which his Majesty&apos;s Ambassador is in agreement: We fully endorse opinion expressed in Bagdad telegram No. 487,13th November, that we are generally expected to do something drastic or dramaticon analogy of the Stack murder, and that ultimate effect of the crime will depend largely on what action is taken to punish assassins and their masters.By showing weakness or tolerance in face, of Jewish terrorism we stand to lose respect of Egypt and the Arab world, and faith in method of violence willspread, among the Arabs as well as Jews and even among the Egyptians. We havealready reached, if not passed, limit of safety and cannot avoid consequences of failing to take whatever steps are judged necessary and effective.Attitude of Jewish leaders in Palestine will be determined solely by calcula-tion of what is best for their own position and cause. They are afraid ofextremists gaining control and of their political claims being prejudiced. Theyhave every reason for wishing to be rid of extremists, but preferably, of course, in circumstances which would strengthen their own position While weakening ours.Hence their desire to establish for themselves, as a condition of collaboration with government, special position which would place them upon a level with theGovernment itself. Therefore, if their full assistance is to be secured upon termsconsistent with authority of Government, they must be forced into it by conviction that we have made up our minds to act firmly and resolutely and by concreteevidence of injury done to their cause and of attainment of their objective beingdelayed by extremist methods.Action should be taken promptly at a time when it is being generally expected and while recent tragedy is fresh in people&apos;s minds. Nettle must be graspedsooner or later. This is not the moment we should choose. But we may not havea more favourable one and it is at least better than the one chosen by our opponents. Certainly there will never be a time when our actions will receive more general sympathy and approbation from the outside world.Two measures which seem calculated to have the required effect and whichcould be taken without prejudice to whatever decision may eventually be reached on Palestine policy are : (1) Disarming of irregular Jewish forces; (2) suspension of pending action to complete immigration quota as laid clown in White Paper.We consider that issues which are at stake in this area are such as to justifyprovision of necessary naval, land and air forces even at the expense of operationselsewhere. Not only should we lose respect and authority in this area and furtherafield by failing to take adequate measures, but we shall be playing false to causesfor which the war is being fought if we permit political gangsterism to flourishunchecked in territory under our own control. We may well lose more bypermitting our authority to be successfully challenged in Palestine by methodssuch as these than by consequences which diversion of troops might have upon theprogress of the war in Italy.We consider, finally, that terrorism must be stamped out before His Majesty&apos;sGovernment decides on any solution of Palestine problem which Arabs would regard as favourable to the Jews. Otherwise our policy will be [group undecypherable] attributed to weakness and our position will be rendered moredifficult than ever.(Repeated to Bagdad, Beirut, Jerusalem and Jedda.)[28671] b2
ANNEX II.From Secretary of State, Colonies, to Palestine (Field-Marshal Viscount Gort).Top Secret and Personal. 18th November, 1944.Addressed High Commissioner.   Repeated Commander-in-Chief, Cairo.My telegram 17th November, Top Secret and Personal, and my telegramNo. 1505.1. Prime Minister has asked me to tell you why he did not go further than he did in his statement on Palestine in the House of Commons on 17th November.Following are the reasons : Suspension of immigration or threat of suspension might simply play intohands of the extremists. At present the Jews generally seem to have been shockedby Lord Moyne&apos;s death into a mood in which they are more likely to listen toWeizmann&apos;s counsels of moderation. Proposed announcement would come asa shock of a different kind and, so far from increasing their penitence, mightwell provide a not unwelcome diversion and excite a bitter outcry against theGovernment. Weizmann would doubtless join in protest (saying that whole community were being punished for acts of a small minority), but the initiative in such a situation would pass to the extremists. Thus those responsible forthe murder would be themselves the gainers. It might well unite the whole forcesof Zionism.anci even world Jewry against us instead of against the terrorist bands.2. While recognising that the situation calls for signal action, the PrimeMinister wonders whether such action should not be more clearly directed against that section of the community with whom the responsibility lies, e.g., byenforcing even more drastic penalties in the case of those found in possessionof firearms&apos; or belonging to proscribed societies. In particular, might not actionbe taken against the nominally respectable leaders of the Party whose extremistwing are the authors of these political crimes? If their national status is non-Palestinian, they might be deported : if Palestinian, they should be banished.3. I should like to have your views as soon as possible, in the light of presentconditions in Palestine.ANNEX III.From Palestine (Field-Marshal Viscount Gort) to Secretary of State, Colonies.(No. H.C. 1535.   Top Secret.) 21st November, 1944.Addressed to Secretary of State. Repeated to Commander-in-Chief,Middle East.1. I have discussed your telegram of 18th November with my ExecutiveCouncil and with the General Officer Commanding, but, so far, I have not hadthe opportunity of hearing the views of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East.I have, however, seen Resident Minister, Cairo, telegram No. 2448 and HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador, Egypt, telegram No. 2398, both to the Foreign Office.2. I am very grateful to hear the views of the Prime Minister on thisthorny problem and I have carefully noted them for my future guidance. WhilstI fully appreciate the cogency of the arguments, and, indeed, in my telegram toyou on 9th November I ventured to suggest that Dr. Weizmann should be given  an opportunity to tackle the whole question on his arrival, I still feel that wemust have our plans laid so as to be ready to take a firm line should events notdevelop as it is hoped they will. (I had Dr. Weizmann to lunch yesterday andI am proposing to see him again next week after he has had an opportunity to look round.)3. There are undoubtedly members of the Jewish Agency, and obviouslyalso of the general Jewish community, who still require to be reminded that theyare approaching major road ahead in deteriorating weather and that, if worseis not to befall them, a full realisation of their responsibilities is absolutely essential. For this reason I would venture to urge again that it should, be impressed on Palestine Jewry that, if further outrages occur, His Majesty&apos;s
Government will be forced to take drastic action, and even possibly to go so faras to divert elsewhere immigrants destined for Palestine, until more settledconditions can be re-established here. I fully appreciate that this may appearto run contrary to the counsel indicated in paragraph 1 of your telegram, but does it do so in fact ? The threat would be translated into fact only if Weizmannfails in his present mission, and, were he to fail, I do not believe that Weizmannwould expect the British Government to do other than act with great firmnessand speed.4. Should events make it necessary to show our teeth, the two principalmeasures which we oould put into force, as you and also the Middle East DefenceCommittee have suggested, are-(a) Wholesale searches for arms, and(b) Stoppage of immigration.I realise that these both require a considerable reinforcement of the Garrison(see my telegram of 9th November, now confirmed in Middle East DefenceCommittee telegram No. 2448). Although the intention to disarm irregularJewish forces by wholesale (omitted : ? searches) for arms and could not bepreviously disclosed, it would be likely to be the more effective and lastingmeasure, and it has the advantage that it would be less open to world criticismthan the stoppage of immigration. But, as I indicated in paragraph 2 of my telegram of 9th November, a prerequisite would be the immediate availabilityand the employment of forces sufficient to ensure complete success. Much as Idislike the prospect of making recommendation which might interfere in anyway with the progress of the war, we must be prepared to act quickly in the eventof further outrages because, as indicated in telegrams Nos. 2398 and 2448, our prestige in the Middle East would be seriously affected if, on yet anotheroccasion, we failed to react. The only way in which we can act promptly is tohave the necessary forces in situ in Palestine during the next few critical months,when campaigning in Italy is likely to be restricted by the weather.5. My Executive Council have suggested two other possible alternativesin the event of further outrages (a) A heavy collective fine on the whole Jewish community.(b) Deportation of Jewish political leaders on analogy of the Arab higher committee in 1937.We believe that both of these measures would be likely to provoke widespread and bitter resentment amongst world Jewry and deportation (corrupt group) so.6. With reference to paragraph 2 of your telegram, we already have inforce the death penalty for carrying arms on conviction by Military Courts, andlife imprisonment for being in possession. Following your suggestion. I intendforthwith to strengthen Emergency Regulations 14C to 14E dealing withunlawful associations.7. I do not believe that it would be wise at the present time to discriminate between the various Jewish political factions in Palestine. During the short period I have been here, I have formed the impression that.the Jewish Agency is always attempting to escape from its obligations and duties by attempting to pinthe blame for terrorist activities on to Irgun Zvai Leumi, the Stern Group, &amp;c.In practice, supporters of terrorists are to be found in all sections of Yishuv, butthe ultimate and inescapable responsibility for assisting the Government in themaintenance of law and order must rest with the Agency. The issue for Zionismto-day is clear cut: it is whether the Jewish Agency can regain the control it has lost, or whether the smoke of the assassins&apos; pistols will win-the day.ANNEX IV.Note by the Chiefs of Staff giving their views on the Military implications of a Wholesale Search for Arms in Palestine.Secret Holdings of Arms in Palestine.1. The Jews are believed to hold some 50,000 small arms and some hundreds of mortars and machine guns concealed in sixty principal caches in the settle-ments. No detailed information on the location of these caches, which are extremely well concealed, is available, and it is thought that they are not knowneven to the local Jewish settlers. . Precautions have been taken against the useof mine detectors.
A wholesale search would, therefore, be a matter of considerable difficulty,and would involve the complete clearance of whole areas; nor could success be guaranteed. If results generally were negative, the operation could be made to appear as a defeat for the British forces, with resulting deterioration in thewhole internal security situation in Palestine.2. Arab arms are individually held and concealed and the total is difficultto estimate, but it is probably not far short of that held by the Jews,Reactions to Wholesale Search.3. The very great importance attached by the Jews to the continuedpossession of their own arms was clearly demonstrated at Ramat Hakovesh, where an exhaustive search was undertaken in November, 1943, and, in spite of surprise,a fanatical resistance was put up. Demonstrations and disorders followed andthe Jewish Agency leaders plainly intimated to the then High Commissioner thatany further searches would meet with concerted resistance. Preparations were,in fact, made for such resistance.4. Although the Jewish Agency has recently been co-operating in the cam-paign against the terrorists and has even supplied evidence which has led^ tothe arrest of many suspects, it seems most unlikely from past experience thatit would lend support and it might even offer resistance to a policy of wholesalesearch.5. It therefore appears probable that the adoption of a policy of whole-sale search would provoke quick and widespread reaction through all Jewishareas in Palestine, which might lead to a full-scale conflict with the Hagana,now upwards of 50,000 strong and adequately armed and trained.6. On the Arab side, no concerted resistance need be anticipated, but passiveobstruction and local conflicts would render the task of search very difficult.Effect on the General Military Situation in the Middle East.7. The defection of labour in Palestine, which would result from widespreaddisorders, would cause embarrassment to all three Services. The partial orcomplete stoppage of work in all installations and workshops in Palestine whichform part of the Middle East Base, would throw an additional burden on thealternative facilities in Egypt. Moreover, the oil output from Haifa refineriesmust in any case be safeguarded and the pipeline and refineries would, therefore,require special protection. It might also be necessary to import labour, but this could be arranged.Forces Necessary for Wholesale Search.8. Wholesale searches for arms must be carried out simultaneously on thelargest possible scale to ensure that full advantage is gained from surprise.The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, estimates that it would be unwise toundertake wholesale searches unless a second British infantry division could bemade available in Palestine and retained there for some months. Although this force might be adequate to deal with the resulting disorders initially, we agreewith the High Commissioners view that the ultimate commitment in Palestinemight absorb forces in excess of .this. Moreover, it could not be guaranteed thatthe wholesale search would be successful, because of the ingenuity with whichthe arms are hidden and the scarcity of the information about them.Provision of Forces.9. At present there is only one British infantry division (5th Division)in the Middle East. This is due to move to Italy at the end of December onrelief by a tired British division drawn from Italy. By retaining 5th division in Palestine, it would be possible to make available the two British divisionsrequired initially. This would, however, be at the direct expense of operations in Europe, which in our opinion is unacceptable.Conclusion.10. The institution of a wholesale search for arms in Palestine would entail a military commitment which could be met only at the direct expense of operations against Germany.  Even then the success of such a search could not be guaranteed.(Signed)16th November, 1944.A. F. BROOKE.C. PORTAL.ANDREW CUNNINGHAM. -
