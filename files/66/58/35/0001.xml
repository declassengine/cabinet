THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPEERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTvlPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.Copy No, OW.P. (44) 685.24:th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.TEMPORARY CIVIL SERVANTS AND parliamentary candidature.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE statement by the Chief Agents of the four main Political Parties,circulated by the Minister of Labour and National Service with his memorandum .P. (44) 645, contains a request that &quot; consideration should be given to menand women employed as temporary Civil Servants who desire to submit themselvesto Selection Committees as Parliamentary candidates.&quot; The statement goes on to say that the present regulations vary a great deal in their application,and that some temporary Civil Servants are permitted to become Parliamentarycandidates whereas others are called upon to resign their posts.2.   This is a matter to which I have recently been giving consideration.3. The Servants of the Crown (Parliamentary Candidature) Order, 1927,provides that &quot; No person employed by or under the Crown to Whom this Orderapplies shall issue an address to electors or in any other manner publicly announcehimself or allow himself to be publicly announced as a candidate or a prospectivecandidate for election to Parliament for any constituency until he has retired orresigned froin such employment.&quot; The Order does not apply to holders of politicaloffices, to Certain classes of industrial Civil Servants, to retired officers of the armed Forces, or to officers and men of any of the auxiliary or reserve forcesin so far as they are not embodied Or called out on permanent or active service;but otherwise it applies to all Civil Servants and members of the Armed Forces.So far as members of the Armed Forces are concerned, however, steps have beentaken during this war to enable any officer or man, including a regular, to become a candidate for Parliament without severing his connection with the Forces.4. There has been no similar dispensation for Civil Servants, whetherpermanent or temporary. The War Cabinet considered this restriction on CivilServants on the 17th April, 1941 (W.M. (41) 41st Conclusions,&apos; Minute 8), butdecided that the existing rules should not be modified.5. I do not know what grounds the Chief Agents of the four main political parties have for saying that the present regulations vary a great deal in their application. The terms of the 1927 Order-in-Council are clear, and departments are of course aware of them. The Treasury has on several occasions during thewar been asked by Departments whether exceptions could be made to the general rule for individual temporary Civil Servants; and the reply has always beenin the negative. The Treasury is aware of one or two cases where temporary officers were already prospective candidates for Parliament before being appointedto the Civil Service; such officers have not been required to resign their candi-datUre, but they have been allowed to retain it on the strict understanding that so long as they are employed in the Civil Service they must take no overt stepswhatever to further it, e.g., by addressing political meetings or canvassing. This,though in fact it does not contravene the wording of the Order-in-Council, is undoubtedly somewhat of an inconsistency; but if the inconsistency gave riseto complaint, it would have to be removed (as the Order-in-Council stands atpresent) by withdrawing the permission granted to those officers to retain theircandidature, and not by allowing other temporary officers to become candidates.[28681]
6.&apos; I do not feel that I need argue the case for prohibiting permanent CivilServants from becoming candidates for Parliament; I am sure my colleagues will agree that it is of the utmost importance to maintain, so far as they areconcerned, the traditional code of conduct which debars Civil Servants from openparticipation in political activities. The ban on Parliamentary candidatureis only one item in this code, and if it were removed many undesirable con-sequences might follow.7. It has, however, been suggested that a distinction can be drawn betweenthe permanent career officer and the war-time temporary Civil Servant. many men and women are now serving in temporary Civil Service posts whosepermanent career lies elsewhere; and it has been represented that it is undulyharsh to the individual, as well as depriving the Service of valuable officers, torequire resignation in such cases before public announcement of prospectiveParliamentary candidature for a particular constituency.8. In my view a distinction drawn in favour of temporary Civil Servantswould not be justified. As was pointed out when the War Cabinet last considered the problem in 1941, the Civil Service during the war has even widercontacts than usual with the rest of the community, and there are considerablepossibilities of friction and misunderstanding which do not exist in peace-time(and&quot;which, incidentally, do not arise in the case of the Armed Forces). Inmany cases, moreover, it is precisely the war-time recruits who are brought intothe closest contact with outside interests. If these war-time recruits were allowed to become publicly identified with particular political views, I think there would be a considerable danger of public criticism and resentment.Further,- if such a concession were granted to temporary officers, it is difficultto see how a similar concession could be logically refused to other Civil Servants,including permanent Civil Servants, engaged on precisely the same work or on work involving even less contact with the general public.9. .It is, of course, the case that a good many temporary Civil Servantsare people who were more or less widely known, before their appointment tothe Service, to have identified themselves with particular political parties. Itis also the case that a number of Members of Parliament have been appointedto Civil Service posts during the war, with the necessary certificate from thePrime Minister under the House of Commons Disqualification (temporary provisions) Acts stating that &quot; the appointment is required in the publicinterest for purposes connected with the present war.&quot; But I think there isa difference between appointing an individual of known political antecedentsto the Civil Service, to fill a particular war-time post, and allowing temporary officers already in the Service to make new public declarations of their politicalaffiliations; and apart from the Members of Parliament, I think it is right that temporary officers, so long as they remain in the Civil Service, should berequired to keep their political opinions.in cold storage.10. I should add that, even if candidature were allowed, there would stillbe difficulties if a temporary Civil Servant were actually elected to Parliament;normally he would have to resign at that stage and could be reappointed only with a certificate from the Prime Minister under the House of commons disqualification (Temporary Provisions) Acts; the number of such certificatesis limited by Statute to twenty-five. The same difficulty does not apply to the armed Forces, since during the war they are exempted from the usual statutory provisions by virtue of the House of Commons (Service in His Majesty&apos;s Forces)Act, 1939.11. In conclusion, I consider that the existing rule, forbidding all CivilServants, whether permanent or temporary, from becoming candidates orprospective candidates for Parliament until they have retired or resigned fromtheir Civil Service employment, should be maintained; and as it seems that doubtmay exist in some quarters about the extent of the application of this rule inwar-time, I would propose, if my colleagues agree, that the Treasury shouldremind all Departments of it afresh, and ask them to review any cases in whichit may have been overlooked.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,24:th November, 1944.
