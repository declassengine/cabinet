NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   H.M. ships have sunk -an enemy convoy off the Norwegian coast.. Two convoys from North Russia have arrived in Home Waters without loss.Effective minesweeping operations have enabled a troop convoy to reachSalonika.Home and Norwegian Waters.2. On the 12th the Tirpitz was sunk by Lancasters of Bomber Commandoff Tromsb (see &quot; Air Situation &quot;).3. During the week two convoys of 33 and two ships have arrived in home waters from North Russia escorted by ships of the Home Eleet. During thepassage of the two-ship convoy aircraft from H.M.S. Campania &apos;(escort carrier)destroyed two enemy flying boats 350 miles N.E. of the Faeroes.4. On the night of the 12th/13th H.M. cruisers Kent and Bellona with .M. destroyers Myngs, Verulam, Zambesi and H.M.C. destroyer Algonquinattacked a northbound escorted convoy N.W. of the Naze. It is estimated thatof the 11 ships and escorts comprising the convoy all except two were sunk.On the 13th, Norwegian M.T.B.s torpedoed and probably sank a large north-bound enemy supply ship and an armed trawler north of Bergen.On the 14th aircraft from H.M.S. Pursuer (escort carrier) sank an armedtrawler and probably another in Trondheim Fiord. They also bombed the radarstation at Titran near the entrance to the fiord. H.M.S. Euryalus (cruiser) with .M. destroyers Caesar, Nubian, Venus and Zephyr covered the operation.5.   During the week ending the 13th combined British and U.S. dischargesthrough the liberated ports of France and Belgium were approximately 27,000.men, 6,085 vehicles, 250,000 tons of supplies and 69,000 tons of petrol.Mediterranean.6. Allied warships have continued to bombard enemy positions on the franco-Italian frontier.7. In the Adriatic preliminary reports state that the harbour at Zara isbadly damaged, but at Sibenik there is safe anchorage for four Liberty ships inthe approach channel.On the 14th H.M. ships Wheatland and Brocklesby (destroyers) bombardedBar harbour (Dalmatian coast).8. After extensive minesweeping operations warships and a convoy arrivedat Salonika. Bad weather impeded the unloading of troops, motor transport and stores, but on the 14th it was reported that the weather had improved and unloading was proceeding satisfactorily.On the 12th H.M.S. Kimberley (destroyer) bombarded an enemy battery atAlimnia Island (off NW. coast of Rhodes). On the same day M.Ls. sank oneof two F.-lighters endeavouring to reach the island.East Indies.9. On the 2nd H.M. S/M Shalimar bombarded a small harbour in theNicobars. A number of small craft alongside the jetty were sunk and threelanding craft were damaged.Pacific.10. On the 9th air reconnaissance reported four enemy battleships, threeheavy cruisers, three light cruisers and destroyers steering S.E. between Borneoanji Palawan; on the following day this force was reported east of Palawan.The force sighted represents the whole of the effective battleship strengthof the main Japanese fleet and half its effective heavy cruiser strength. three other effective heavy cruisers, not sighted on the 9th, were in the centralPhilippines at the time and may have joined the main body later. The destination of this force is unknown.U.S. coastal craft torpedoed a destroyer and an escort vessel leaving Ormoc.Other attacks on enemy shipping by carrier-borne aircraft in this area, are given under &quot; Air Situation.&quot;
11. Between the 23rd and 31st October H.M. S/M Stoic on patrol in theJava Sea sank a 700-ton tanker, a small coaster and a barge and torpedoed a cargo ship.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. Eight attacks on U-boats were reported during the week, of which fivewere by ships and three by aircraft.On the 11th corvettes of the 30th Escort Group possibly sank a U-boat southof Ireland (R), and on the 13th frigates of the 17th Escort Group possibly sank one west of the Orkneys.Enemy Intelligence.U-boats.13. U-boats continue to operate off the west and south-western shores ofthe United Kingdom and there are probably one or two in the English Channel.A U-boat has been patrolling off Reykjavik and there has been some increase of activity off the coast of Norway.Twenty-four U-boats have been located in Norwegian ports during the week.Enemy Attack on Shipping.14. Two ships, stragglers from a convoy to Iceland (C), were sunk by aU-boat off Reykjavik. One ship was damaged by a mine off Havre, and in theMediterranean another ship was damaged by a mine off Port Said.Allied Minelaying.-, 15. Mines have been laid by surface craft in Home Waters and by aircraft in the Heligoland Bight and the Kattegat. Aircraft also laid mines in- theRangoon area.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Mines weeping.16. There have been no reports of minelaying by enemy aircraft&apos; in home waters, but it is suspected that E-boats laid mines in the approach channel toOstend where a tank landing ship was sunk and H.M.S. Hydra (minesweeper)was seriously damaged.Although bad weather has interfered with minesweeping in the ScheldtEstuary 100 mines were destroyed during the week, making a total of 220. AnM.L. minesweeper was sunk in this area and others were damaged. The sweptchannel to Flushing was established on the 9th. A small minefield has beendetected off the Scilly Islands.17. In the Mediterranean many drifting mines are still being sunk by allied patrols off the coast of the French and Italian Riviera.At Salonika, before the port was opened for the arrival of the first troopconvoy, extensive minesweeping operations accounted for over 100 mines.18. During the four months June to September, when the enemy was makinghis maximum minelaying effort, over1 2,100 mines were destroyed by Britishminesweepers and only 12 ships were sunk.The mine totals are 6,075 ground, 6,624 moored.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.   (An outline map is enclosed as an inset.)General.19. During the past week the principal development has been the advanceof the Third U.S. Army south of Metz. In spite of the bad weather .and heavygoing which has been typical of the entire Allied front, the Third U.S. army has advanced over 18 miles at points along a 30-mile front. On the right flank of its advance it is out-flanking Dieuze. On the left it is within a mile of the outskirts of Metz.
The regrouping in the Northern Group of Armies, consequent upon thecompletion of the operations to free the port of Antwerp, has now shown fruitin a five-mile advance towards the Maas south of Venlo.SSouthern Group of Armies.20. French troops attacked on the 14th, in the area 15 miles S.W. of Belfort,and have advanced up to five miles on a 15-mile front.East of Epinal U.S. troops have been making slow but steady progress.North of St. Die the enemy salient west of the Meurthe has been eliminated,and in the area east of Luneville U.S. troops have been making limited advanceson a 12-mile front.Central Group of Armies. . -21. At 0800 hours on the 8th, the Third TJ.S. Army attacked on a 25-milefront between Nancy and Pont-a-Mousson. The momentum of the advance hasbeen maintained by armoured thrusts along the whole front, and in the southU.S. troops are within four miles of Dieuze, and to the north are reported tobe within one mile of the outskirts of Metz. The advance soon crossed theRiver Seille, the last river obstacle before the Rhine, and has cut the importantrailway lines Metz-Saarbrucken and Metz-Saarburg.On the 8th also, U..S. troops forced a crossing over the Moselle in the area east of Thionville. Progress was at first slow, owing to bad weather and stiffresistance, but the bridgehead has now been expanded to about ten miles wideand from two to four miles deep.Northern Group of A armies.22. On the 8th Polish troops eliminated the last enemy bridgehead over theMaas at Moerdijk, and two days later British troops cleared up the remnants ofthe enemy garrison of Walcheren, which had been marooned by the floods. these operations concluded the military measures necessary to free the port of Antwerp.During this period, and subsequently, the Northern Group of Armies has been occupied with re-grouping.On the 14th British troops east of Weert attacked towards the Maas tenmiles away. This area includes a network of carmls, and has-been-heavily mined.These factors, rather than enemy opposition which has been light, have limited the rate of advance. On the right, our troops were last reported on the outskirts of two towms within five miles of the Maas, and, on the left, have occupied Meijel.Italy.   (An outline map is enclosed as an inset.)23. The enemy put up stiff opposition to the attack which was launchedto the south of Highway 9 on the night 7/8th, but by the 9th the town of Forliwas in our possession and our forward line was roughly along the River Montone.The following day, light forces crossed the Ronco N.E. of Forli. On the 12thBritish troops succeeded in getting across the Montone in two places S.W. ofForli, under shell fire, but not in contact with the enemy.The latest information reveals a withdrawal by the Germans along the whole front in this sector, and our forward line has advanced accordingly. forward troops are now only six miles short of Faenza.Meanwhile, on the left the Polish Corps have been continuing their advancenorthwards on either side of the upper Montone Valley. They are now N.E. ofModigliana and in touch with the British troOps on their right.The only change in forward positions on the Fifth Army front is on theextreme right flank, where Indian forces have thrust N.E. in the direction ofModigliana, which is thus being squeezed in between these forces and those ofthe Poles to the east.On the remainder of the front regrouping has continued.the  Eastern European Campaign.   (An outline map is enclosed as an inset.)Finland.24. The Germans are still withdrawing northwards, followed up by the finns.Northern Sector.25. After a short lull the Russians have now resumed their attacks in thearea east of Libau.
Southern Sector.26. North-west and west of Debrecen the Russians have made a considerable advance, crossing the River Tisa on a wide front and cutting the railwayMiskolc-Budapest. North of Czegled they have also gained a little-ground, butin the immediate area of Budapest they have made no further progress duringthe week.In Northern. Yugoslavia the Russians forced a crossing of the Danube S.W.of Sombor. - Further south Russian and Bulgarian troops made a general advancewestward, in the course of which Skoplje was captured.Greece.27. Greek troops arrived in the piraeus on the 8th and were enthusiasticallyreceived as tihey marched through the streets of Athens. The following dayImperial troops disembarked at Salonika.Yugoslavia.28. The Germans have now succeeded in opening the two escape routesthrough Partisan-held territory east and S.E. of Visegrad. a They are alsoattempting to clear further inland routes north of Podgorica, since the coastalarea is too strongly held by Marshal Tito&apos;s men to permit the passage of their forces now in Albania and Montenegro.Burma.   (An outline map is enclosed as an inset.)29. Our troops are closing in on Kalemyo. Fort White was occupied on the10th and Nos. 2 and 3 Stockades on the 11th. Allied troops advancing down theKabaw valley have linked up with the troops who have advanced from the FortWhite area and forward elements are believed to have entered Kalemyo itself onthe 15th.On the Chindwin river, Mawlaik was occupied without opposition on the 10th.British troops advancing down the Myitkyina-Mandalay railway corridoroccupied the village of Pinwe on the 13th. Chinese troops are closing in onBhamo, to the west of which the village of Shwegu was occupied on the 9th andto the east, Momauk-on the 10th. Up to this point enemy resistance has beennegligible despite stiffening resistance over the last few days. Chinese troops arenow within two miles of Bhamo from the north and six miles from the east.They have also reached the areas 28 miles S.S.W. and eight miles S.E. of Bhamo.China.   (An outline naap is enclosed as an inset.)30. Japanese forces advancing down the Hunan-Kwangsi railway capturedLiuchow on the 11th and an enemy column has advanced up the railway leadingN.W. from Liuchow to a point 20 miles east of Ishan.All communication has been cut with Kweilin since the 10th and the town isbelieved to have fallen.Japanese forces in the West River region have reached the main Liuchow-Nanning highway.Philippines.31. In the northern sector of Leyte bitter fighting continues in the Ormocvalley where the Japanese have recently succeeded in substantially reinforcingtheir troops. The Japanese pocket at Dagami continues to hold out. U.S. patrolsfrom the Baybay area have advanced southwards along the western coast toMatalom and northwards to Caridan.The latest estimate of enemy casualties is 15,530 killed up to the 10th and109 prisoners of war up to the 14th.AIR SITUATION.General Review.32.   The battleship Tirpitz was sunk by Lancasters off Tromso.Heavy attacks were made on oil and communications targets in Germanyand on tactical targets in the Metz area.

Thirteen enemy aircraft were destroyed and four were damaged; 109 Allied aircraft are missing.Operations were considerably restricted by adverse weather conditions and nearly all the bombing attacks were made through cloud, with unobserved results.On the 12th, 32 Lancasters took off to attack the battleship Tirpitz, offTromso. In clear weather with excellent visibility, the crews indentified the targetvisually and 29 aircraft attacked, each dropping one 12,000 lb. H.E. bomb.Bombing was well concentrated and at least three hits and several near misseswere obtained. A fire broke out amidships, followed by an explosion and the ship was quickly covered in smoke. Photographs taken by a Mosquito about two hours after the attack show that the ship had capsized with the keel above water.At the opening of the attack, there was moderate heavy and light flak fromthe ship&apos;s armament with intense light flak from attendant ships and shorepositions. Before the end of the attack opposition from the battleship had almostceased. There was no smoke screen and no opposition from fighters. OneLancaster force landed in Sweden.Attacks were made on . the following synthetic oil plants in the Ruhr:Dortmund (two attacks, 2,026 tons), Castrop-Rauxel (593 tons), Bottrop/Welheim(307 tons), G-elsenkirchen/Buer (212 tons), and Kamen (56 tons).Nearly 920 tons of bombs were dropped in a night attack on Harbireg andtwo oil refineries in the town. Weather was clear except for a thin layer of cloud and the targets were accurately marked. Bombing was scattered at the beginningof the attack but improved later and caused fires which were burning well at theend. Chemical works at Wiesbaden were bombed in daylight, 112 tons being dropped.Among other targets attacked were the industrial area of Wanne-Eickel(1,312 tons), railway centres at saarbrucken (949 tons), Oberlahnstein nearCoblenz (354 tons), Saarlautern (103 tons) and Hanau (100 tons) and airfields atHanau (369 tons), Cologne (320 tons) and Wiesbaden (159 tons).Small-scale attacks, mainly by Mosquitoes, were made on other targets,including Rheine, Coblenz, Hanover and Berlin.* In the battle area, heavy bombers attacked tactical targets near Metz andThionville in support of Allied troops, dropping 2,194 tons; cloud conditionsprevented observation of results. Medium, light and fighter bombers and fightersattacked enemy troop concentrations, dumps, railways, roads and strong points in holland and NW. Germany. Railway tracks were cut in a large number of places and several bridges, locomotives and gun positions and many road and railway vehicles were destroyed or damaged.A total of 1,819 sorties was flown by aircraft carrying supplies to theContinent.
G.affairs. offensive operations were confined to harassing attacks by Me. 262,flying singly, on airfields and communications targets in Holland. On no occasionhas the effort exceeded ten aircraft per day. Tactical reconnaissance patrols overthe battle area in Holland and the Metz sector were regularly maintained by amaximum of ten single-engined aircraft daily. Fighter activity was againcurtailed by bad weather. Close support forces probably did not fly more than100 sorties per day. Night fighter activity was negligible, with a maximum effort of some 50/75 sorties in reaction to Bomber Command raids on Dortmund,Harburg and other targets on the night of the 11/12th.Southern Europe.36.   Adverse weather continued to restrict operations.During the week ended the 15th, aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew a total of10,010 sorties, and 5,853 tons of bombs were dropped. Of the above sorties 1,940were by heavy bombers (36 missing).

On the 12th/13th November Blechhammer oil refinerywas attacked by Fortresses. Pathfinder technique was employed, and 31 tonsdropped; large fires and explosions were seen.
Russia.40. Chiefly due tO&apos; adverse weather the operations of the Russian Air Forcehavg been curtailed, and no operations have been reported. The G.A.F. hascontinued to maintain a fair scale of effort in the Budapest area; activity else-where was limited by weather.The necessity to conserve resources of fuel, aircraft and man-power islimiting the activity of the G.A.F. to critical situations.Far East.Burma.41.
