THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 657.With November, 1944.WAR CABINET.EMPIRE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE War Cabinet, on the 16th June, 1944,* appointed a ministerial committee, t to examine the proposals contained in the Report, dated the10th May, 1944, of the Commonwealth Communications Council that Cable and wireless, Ltd., should be superseded by a series of public utility corporations tobe set up in the United Kingdom, each of the Dominions and India.2. We have examined the position and, with the exception of the Lord privy seal, are agreed on the following conclusions : (i) that a strong case is made for deciding now in principle that Cable and wireless, Ltd., should be placed on a public utility footing by the elimination of the private shareholder interest;(ii) that the Commonwealth Communications Council proposals for thecreation of a series of public utility corporations should not be accepted and that instead we should endeavour to secure the agreement of theGovernments of the Dominions and India to a public utility organisa-tion on an effective Empire basis providing for the maximum localautonomy consistent with the requisite unification of policy andcontrol.3. The main factors which have led us to the conclusion at 2 (i) above areas follows  -(a) The operation by the Dominions and India of direct wireless telegraphcircuits to foreign countries outside the present Cable and Wireless,Ltd., system deprives the Company of profitable traffic. The expecteddevelopment of this policy, which is generally contrary to undertakings&apos;given by the Commonwealth Governments to support the Company,will undermine its future financial position.(6) The present system with its responsibilities to private shareholders andfaced with considerable financial problems cannot provide the cheap,wide and efficient public service which the Commonwealth requires.(c) Even apart from the financial implications of direct wireless circuits,the post-war financial prospects of the Company are poor. Indeed,with increased costs, competition from fast airmail services andforeign interests, &amp;c, the Company will, save perhaps in the earlypost-war period when traffic may remain at an artificially high level,do well to break even.* W.M. (44) 79th Conclusions, Minute 3.W.P. (44) 309.f The Committee consists of : The Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman) ;The Lord President of the Council ;The Lord Privy Seal ;The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs ;The Secretary of State for India ;The Secretary of State for the Colonies ;The Postmaster-General.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was also present.[28630]
2(d) The claim by the Dominions and India for a greater share in both central and local control cannot be met within the present framework.(e) The present organisation does not provide the required unity of policyand direction necessary for presenting a unanimous front to foreign interests.The cumulative effect of these factors leaves us convinced that the existing arrangements should be replaced by a system on public utility lines, with theprivate shareholder interest eliminated.4. We have examined the alternatives to the present system (summarised in the Annex) put forward at the Commonwealth Communications Councilproceedings, namely, a scheme for a series of public utility corporations recom-mended by the Council, and the Company&apos;s scheme for a single EmpireCorporation. Our conclusion is that the Council&apos;s scheme fails to provide unity of policy and control, and appropriate sharing of financial responsibilities, bothof which are in our view essential to any Empire system. The measures proposedto secure co-ordination, such as a nominal exchange of shareholding, will in ourview be largely ineffective, and the degree of unity achieved by the present system would appear to be very largely sacrificed to meet the demands of local autonomy.The result may well be an aggravation of the conditions which have led to economicand other friction in the past.5. The scheme submitted by the Company was rejected by the commonwealth communities Council on the ground that it did not meet the requirementsof local autonomy. The Council, however, made no real examination of thescheme, and, while we agree that in the form presented it fails to take adequateaccount of local autonomy, we consider that it is only on an effective Empirebasis that a sound solution can be found. We are fully conscious of the difficulties,which have been emphasised by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,of persuading the Dominions to adopt any form of single Empire organisation.Nevertheless, we consider that the objections raised to the principle of thescheme are not well founded, and that fuller consideration of the fundamentalsshould convince all concerned that a unified policy for Empire tele-communicationsis required, and must necessarily carry with it a cohesive organisation. Moreover,there seems to us to be no reason why the requirement of local autonomy cannotbe adequately met within a framework of this kind.&quot;6. We. consider that the conception of a scheme on this basis is so superior to the scheme recommended by the Commonwealth Communications Council that every effort should be made to secure the consent of the Dominions and Indiato its adoption in principle.7. We have also considered the alternative of direct State operation buton balance having regard to the political controversy which would inevitablyfollow, and the fact that a public utility scheme on an Empire basis represents a logical development of the present system, we are against this alternative.8. We consider that the promotion of a United Kingdom Governmentmission to explore the position with the Governments of the Dominions andIndia would offer the best prospects of success as a first approach. In viewof the past history of this problem such a mission should be quite independent of the Commonwealth Communications Council. It would be important to avoid creating the impression that we were attempting to impose on the DominionGovernments a centralised organisation since more harm than good might result.The object of this mission would be to explain the disadvantages of the Common-wealth Communications Council scheme and submit the advantages of analternative scheme on an Empire basis. If this proposal commends itself tomy colleagues I would propose to consult with the Prime Minister as to the choice of the leader of the mission; he should clearly be qualified to present the casediplomatically.9. There is another reason for urgency. Last October, the United StatesGovernment asked for negotiations with the British Commonwealth on tele-communication matters. As it was clearly desirable that the basic principlesof the Commonwealth organisation in the post-war period should be settledbefore any discussions, the United States Government were informed that wewould do our best to be in a position to open negotiations with them early inthe new year. The fact that these negotiations are pending in the near futuremakes it all the more important to approach the Dominion and Indian Govern-ments without delay.
10.   The Committee recommend-(i) That a decision be now taken in principle in favour of adopting apublic utility organisation in place of the present Cable and WirelessLtd. system.(ii) That the Commonwealth Communications Council&apos;s scheme for a seriesof public utility corporations in the United Kingdom, each, of theDominions and India should not be accepted. Instead, we should aim at an alternative arrangement on an effective Empire basis, to be worked out in consultation with the Governments and providing for;the maximum local autonomy consistent with the requisite unification of policy and control,(iii) That a mission should be appointed to visit the Dominions and india as soon as possible to put forward the United Kingdom Government&apos;views.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,16th November, 1944.ANNEX.Part I.Scheme recommended by the Commonwealth Communications Council.(a) A Government-owned public utility corporation should be established inthe United Kingdom to acquire Cable and Wireless (Holding), Ltd.The United Kingdom, the Dominions and India would be expected tobear their full share of the responsibility for the maintenance of the cables by the United Kingdom Corporation.(b) The establishment of the United Kingdom Cable and Wireless Corpora-tion should be followed, as soon as can be conveniently arrangedhaving regard to local conditions, by the establishment in theDominions and India of similar Government-owned public utilitycorporations to take over, from the various authorities at presentadministering them, the external telecommunications services in theirrespective territories.(c) The United Kingdom and Dominion and Indian corporations should beinterlocked in the following nmnner : Upon the establishment of eachcorporation in the Dominions and India, the United Kingdom cable and Wireless Corporation should transfer to each corporation 5 percent, of the total capital stock of the United Kingdom Cable and wireless Corporation, and should receive in exchange 25 per cent, ofthe total capital stock in each overseas corporation, or some otherpercentage to be agreed. No financial transaction is involved. Theexchange of stock is not on a valuation basis. The objective is tosecure that the four Dominions and India eventually hold 5 per cent,each of the stock of the United Kingdom Corporation.(d) The Board of Directors of the United Kingdom Corporation should consist of 11 members, of whom 6 would be appointed by the Govern-ment of the United Kingdom, which will own, say, 75 per cent, ofthe stock. Of the remaining 5, the Dominion and Indian governments should each appoint 1. The United Kingdom Corporation should appoint 1 director to the Board of each of the Dominion and Indiancorporations upon their formation.(e) The Commonwealth Communications Council would serve as a clearing-house for information and would act as the co-ordinating authority on behalf of the Commonwealth Governments.(/) The intention is that the Commonwealth Communications Council wouldnegotiate with foreign States and telegraph undertakings on behalfof the corporations.
PART II.Scheme recommended by Cable and Wireless Ltd*(a) To form a single Empire Corporation operating throughout the Empireand India with interest at fixed rate to stockholders, guaranteed bythe Governments concerned.(b) The Corporation to be formed under Royal Charter.(c) Existing shareholders of all companies to exchange their stock for stockin the new Corporation with interest at, say, 3 per cent, guaranteed bythe Government concerned. Each of the companies to negotiateseparately with their Governments for the amount of stock to bereceived in exchange.(d) The undertaking to be managed by a Board of Governors in one placewhich shall consist of representatives of the United Kingdom, theDominions, India and the Colonies. The Governing Board would beappointed by the Crown on the recommendation of the PrimeMinisters, Governor-General of India in Council, and Secretary ofState for the Colonies. The numerical representation would have some relation to the interests and responsibilities of the constituent parts.(e) A headquarters executive Management Board to be set up consisting ofa Director-General with five or six officials whose functionalauthority would run throughout the system. In the United Kingdom,in each Dominion, and in India a Regional Director would beappointed who would de facto carry a great deal of responsibility and authority in his region, and would have the equivalent of the head-quarters Management Board of functional executives under him. Ineach region there should be some sort of advisory and consultativepanel to advise and assist the Regional Director, which would also bein touch with the Governing Board in London. There would be aninterchange of officials between headquarters and the regions, head-quarters staff being drawn from all parts and the highest offices being available to anyone.(/) Governments to control through terms laid down in the Charter and bylicences which should be exclusive.(g) All overseas services now operated by Governments, including telephony,to be passed to the control of the new undertaking. Consideration tobe given as to whether it would not be advisable to include the manufacturing companies or some of them, also the ship-to-shorecommunication companies.* The outline here given amplifies the scheme as put forward by Cable and Wireless Ltdto the Commonwealth Communications Council.
