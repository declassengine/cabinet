THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944. ** &quot;SECRET. \l Copy No. J uW.P. (44) 661.l$th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.IN accordance with their Terms of Reference as set out in the PrimeMinister&apos;s minute of the 12th August, 1944 (W.P. (44) 442), the Committee on commercial Policy, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland, thePresident of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, andthe Minister of Food, have given careful consideration to the position ofagriculture under the proposals for a multilateral convention on commercial policy which form the subject of Section II and of Annexes F, G and IT of the document annexed to W.P. (44) 192; and they have now requested me to submit the following report on their behalf to the War Cabinet.2. The Agricultural Departments believe that the principle of stability,i.e., some insurance against sudden or large collapses in price, is essential for any agricultural policy or programme of agricultural production. The level atwhich prices should be stabilised depends mainly on the scale of agricultural production and the level of agricultural wages which it may be thought desirableto maintain in this country. To secure the minimum which could be defended asfulfilling the objective of maintaining &quot; a healthy and well-balancedagriculture &quot; in this country (involving a small, but only a small, increase over pre-war level production and something like the present agricultural wage level)would probably require a level of prices in respect of nearly all commodities some-what above average world prices, i.e., some degree of protection would be required-in some instances possibly a higher degree of protection than existed before thewar. If, because of difficulties in our balance of payments or for some other reason, a higher scale of production were required, a higher degree of protectionwould probably be needed.3. For what is described above as the minimum objective the agricultural departments do not think that the degree qf protection which would have to be afforded to home agriculture need be large in what may be called normalconditions, i.e., years or seasons in which world supply and demand are inequilibrium, or when food is not being sold on this market below costs of produc-tion in the exporting.country. The main problem, as they see it, is to deal withthe abnormal conditions when gluts, dumping and collapse of prices may occur,especially in the case of such perishable products as beef, mutton, pig meat, dairy products, eggs and fruit, which account for a high proportion of the output ofBritish agriculture, and for which this country is virtually the sole &quot;world marketor the main market on which any surpluses from other countries are dumped.*And, in their view, this problem can only be dealt with if we are able to use the quantitative regulation of imports, whether under private or State trading, tomaintain some stability in the Unied Kingdom market.4. The Agricultural Departments do not think it would be possible to safe-guard domestic agriculture within the floor of 10 per cent, protection discussed at Washington. In certain years and in the case of certain commodities a higher level of - protection would be required if exchequer assistance were to be kept within controllable and practicable limits. They believe, however, that theminimum objective for domestic agriculture could be safeguarded within the* Similar problems arise in the case of fish.[28620] b
limits of a convention which in no case allowed a degree of protection whichwould raise prices to consumers by more than 25 per cent., provided that themethods of levy subsidies and quantitative regulation of imports, whether underprivate or State trading, were permitted subject, of course, to their not raisingprices by more than 25 per cent. This would, however, involve two importantmodifications in the Washington proposals : (i) The tariff formula (which under those proposals would also govern the degree of protection which might be afforded by other methods) wouldhave to include a &quot; floor &quot; of about 25 per cent, instead of the 10 percent, discussed at Washington. (The &quot; floor &quot; would also have to be )interpreted as the limit up to which an existing duty may be raisedor a new duty imposed, as well as a limit below which no existingduty need be reduced; but on this we should, in our view, in any casecontinue to insist.)(ii) The quantitative regulation of imports would have to be generallypermitted (subject to its not raising prices by more than 25 per cent.)method of protection.These modifications are so substantial as to alter the whole balance of theproposals. It is virtually certain that both of them would be unacceptable aliketo the United States and to the majority, at any rate, of the Dominions. More-over, in the view of the Board of Trade, the second modification in particularwould destroy the value of the convention from the point of view of our exporttrade, since it would mean that other countries would have the right to applyquantitative regulation to imports of our manufactured goods.5. We have given careful consideration to the following proposals whereby,it has been suggested, the needs of agriculture might be met without fundamentalmodification of the Washington scheme : (a) The use of bulk purchase (by State-trading organisations or ImportBoards), of levy-subsidies, and of tariffs, separately or in combination,within the limits contemplated in the Washington proposals, andreliance . on direct Exchequer subsidies to provide any additional assistance required.(b) The use of import levies and/or bulk purchase within the limits imposed by the convention and the payment of the resultant revenue and profitsinto an Agricultural Fund, from which support would be given to home agriculture in whatever way might be found expedient.We have found, however, that neither of these proposals would provide asolution acceptable to all the Ministers concerned.6. We have accordingly considered whether food-stuffs could be excludedfrom the scope of a multilateral commercial convention or alternatively whetherthey could be made the subject of special provisions within such a convention.There is, in our view, no hope that a number of important countries (includingmost of the Dominions), whose export trade is largely in agricultural products,would be prepared to adhere to a convention which, while laying extensiveobligations on them in other respects, would do nothing to safeguard their principal exports. On the other hand, the conditions governing the productionand consumption of food-stuffs are sufficiently different from those governing the production and consumption of manufactured goods to warrant the belief that a valid case could be established for making them the subject of separateprovisions. We have accordingly turned our attention to the possibility of devising special provisions to cover food-stuffs which, whilst being compatible with the arrangements deemed necessary by the Agricultural Departments tosecure stable agricultural prices, would yet have some chance of being acceptable to the principal exporters of food-stuffs.* 7. We believe that such provisions could be devised on the basis of theprinciple that any guarantee of prices or income to producers, whether inexporting or importing countries, of food-stuffs of types which enter into inter-national trade should be related to a prescribed level of production and shouldbe subject to certain limits.   They might follow these general lines : (i) No method of affording protection to producers of food-stuffs of typeswhich enter into international trade, whether it takes the form of tariffs, levies or quantitative regulation imposed under private or
State trading, should be used to a degree which would raise the price&apos; of any food to domestic consumers over a period of years by more than25 per cent, above the world level,(ii) If a country&apos;s production of any group of food-stuffs of. types whichenter into international trade, calculated as an average over a givennumber of years, exceeded by more than, say, 10 per cent, a given level say the average level of the same country&apos;s production during a given number of pre-war years then that country would be obligedgradually to reduce the degree of protection or financial assistance given to its producers.(iii) The financial assistance referred to in  (ii)  would  include directExchequer subsidies but not subsidies which affect a whole range of commodities (et.g., subsidies for drainage or lime).(iv) Exceptions to the rule under (i) and (ii) would be allowed : (a) Where a shift in a country&apos;s agricultural production is desirable(i) in the interests of nutrition, or (ii) for the purpose of achieving a better balanced agriculture, e.g., by the avoidance of monoculture. (An exception of this sort would be referredto the proposed International Commercial Policy Organisation,acting in consultation with the Food and agriculture organisation.)(b) Where it is appropriate to use quantitative regulation or subsidies for balance of payments reasons.(v) The principle of non-discrimination (subject to the degree of imperial preference eventually agreed as permissible under the proposedgeneral Commercial Convention) would be accepted.8. Such provisions, though differing from those discussed at Washington,would be sufficiently in harmony with the general purposes both of Article VIIand of those discussions to be defensible as the basis for a separate section ofthe proposed Convention. Although in some respects they would be less favour-able to food-exporting countries than the provisions discussed at Washington,in other respects they would be more advantageous; and there is at least a chance that those countries would, on balance, accept them. They would not leave as much scope for the protection of British agriculture as the industry would no doubt like. But, on the assumption that it is the desire of the WarCabinet that the proposals for a multilateral convention should be furtherpursued, the Agricultural Ministers would be prepared to accept them as abasis for discussion. They would, of course, need to be worked out with con-siderably greater precision. This would present some difficulties, but, as a resultof such preliminary consideration as we have been able to give to the problems involved, we do not think that they should be insuperable.9. We accordingly recommend that, on resuming the Article VII. conver-sations with the Americans, the United Kingdom representatives should explainfrankly the difficulties to which the Washington proposals would be likely togive rise from the standpoint of our home agriculture difficulties which in all probability would be felt even more acutely by other European countries-andshould suggest the incorporation in the Washington proposals of a separatesection dealing with food-stuffs of types which enter into international trade,and that they should then develop the suggestions made above.10. If it should be agreed to proceed on these lines it will, of course, benecessary as a first step to inform the Dominions. The matter will require very careful handling because, while it was clear from the last series of discussions with Dominion officials that some, at least, of the Dominion Governments wouldbe likely to press, in their own interests, for considerable modifications in theoriginal Anglo-American proposals, the present suggestions for giving special treatment to food-stuffs would involve substantial further changes which wouldbe of far-reaching importance to the Dominions as agricultural exporting countries. In these circumstances it would have been very desirable, if time had permitted, to hold further discussions with Domi nion officials before putting forward to the Americans new suggestions of this kind. Mr. Hawkins, of theState Department, has, however, already arrived in London on transfer to the embassy, and it is to be expected that he will wish to have a further exchangeof views with us in the very near future. The State Department have been assured that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready for resumption of[28620] B 2
discussions during the autumn, and it would clearly put us in a very difficult position if we were to seek now to put off Mr. Hawkins until there had been time to stage further discussions with Dominion representatives.11. Moreover, until our difficulties have been put to Mr. Hawkins and oursuggestions discussed with him, it is impossible to say what the United states attitude is likely to be towards the separate treatment of food-stuffs in the multi-lateral proposals. If the Americans were to reject the idea in favour of someother method of approach it would be unfortunate if we had in the meantimesummoned a further meeting of Dominion officials in order to examine withthem proposals which had later to be discarded.12. We therefore feel that we must be free to develop our ideas toMr. Hawkins without further discussions with Dominion representatives. Itwill, however, clearly be essential, in advance of conversations with Mr. Hawkins,to take Dominion Governments fully into our confidence and to explain to them the lines on which we are now thinking. This might best be done by means ofa telegram on the lines of the draft which is attached as Annex I to this Report.13. If it is decided that further discussions should be held with Mr. Hawkinson the above lines, we suggest that the opportunity should be taken to broachwith him the question of the meaning of &quot;non-discrimination.&quot; This questionis examined in detail in Annex II to this Report. Briefly, what we propose isthat, in their discussions with Mr. Hawkins, officials should take the line thatthe definition of the principle of non-discrimination in its application toquantitative regulation and State trading will need careful consideration; andthat any.formula eventually adopted must enable an importing country, in theallocation of quotas or purchases, to take account not only of considerations of price, quality, marketability and terms of sale, but also of such factors as itstraditional trading connections and the need to ensure the security of its futuresupplies.14.&quot; It is understood, of course, that any discussions which officials may beauthorised to hold with Mr. Hawkins would be on an exploratory and non-committal basis; and that it would be made clear that officials are not in a positionto commit His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom either to theprinciple of a multilateral commercial convention or to any particular formula?for inclusion in such a convention. There is reason to believe that it is the wishof the United States Administration also that, at this stage, the discussions should continue to be of an informal and non-committal character.J. A.Treasury Chambers,lQth November, 1944.ANNEX I.Draft Telegram to Dominion Governments.Article VII discussions.1. Now that United States Presidential Election is over, further developments in relation to Article VII discussions are to be expected. No datehas been fixed for resumption of conversations with the Americans but some time ago, in response to informal enquiries from them, we said that we on our part would be ready to resume talks in the autumn. More recently, certain indications-reached us that the Americans were preparing for resumption of talks with us,and these indications were followed shortly afterwards by the transfer to theUnited States Embassy in London of Mr. Hawkins of the State Department,who was the principal United States spokesman in the Washington conversations on commercial policy. Procedure which United States Government evidentlyhave in mind is that as next step Hawkins should compare notes with our officials on this topic, and though no formal request has been received from them Hawkinshas made it clear that he would like now to make an early start with -these further talks, with the intention that they should be entirely informal and of the
frankest possible character, so enabling him to feel his way onthis very difficultsubject. This procedure is very welcome to us and, now that Presidential electionis over, we agree that there would be great advantage in resuming theseexploratory conversations as soon as possible.2. Meanwhile we have been giving a good deal of thought to the provisionalproposals on commercial policy which formed the subject of preliminary and non-committal discussion both at Washington and at the two London conferences of commonwealth officials. We feel that our respective officials are to be con-gratulated on the very useful spade work which they have done on this wide andcontroversial field, and it is very satisfactory that these discussions should havedisclosed such a wide measure of unanimity in the minds of those taking partas to the best method of approach to the subject. At the same time, however, itwould be unrealistic not to recognise that the discussions also threw up a numberof difficult and important points both^of principle and detail which will need to be resolved before a multilateral scheme carrying such far-reaching obligationscould be expected to commend itself for general acceptance. Indeed, it is clear from the report of the last series of meetings of Commonwealth officials thatthere were a number of heads on which one or more of the Dominion representa-tives felt that his Government would be likely to regard some modification of theproposals as of special importance. These points we shall bear in mind asdiscussions with the Americans develop.3. Certain special difficulties have also been shown as likely to arise in applying the principles in the case of food-stuffs. The United States officials were unwilling to consider the limitation of export subsidies unless importing countries should be willing to limit State-assisted production for commodities ofwhich world surpluses might exist. We have given further consideration to these problems with special reference not only to the position of agriculture in theUnited Kingdom but also to the closely associated questions of the trade in food-stuffs between the overseas countries of the Commonwealth and the UnitedKingdom.4. The two major difficulties which beset producers all over the worldbefore the war are recognised to have been excessive expansion of assisted high-cost production both in importing and in some exporting countries leading toperiodic dumping of surpluses, more particularly on the United Kingdom marketas the largest importer of food-stuffs, and, secondly, short-term insecurity for pro-ducers of food-stuffs in regard both to internal and external markets which prevented any reasonable planning ahead of production.5. We have had the position of home agriculture and the import of food-stuffs into the United Kingdom in view in considering these problems. Publicopinion has been much impressed by the great contribution made to the war effort by the expansion of our agricultural production, and there is now generalrecognition that the agricultural industry was allowed to sink to too low a levelbefore the war and that in the interests of social policy the balance must be corrected in bur reconstruction plans. We have as yet worked out no detailedlong-range agricultural policy, since in the period immediately ahead there will- continue to be a world shortage of many food-stuffs and the level of our homeagricultural production must be influenced not only by this factor but also by theneeds of our balance of payments position. We are, however, as you know,publicly pledged as a permanent measure to the maintenance of &quot; a healthy and well-balanced &quot; agriculture after the war.6. We do not, of course, interpret this pledge as implying that we shall wish,when the world returns to equilibrium, to keep up in this country a level of home agriculture at all comparable to that reached under war conditions. On the con-trary, a very substantial fall in that level is to be expected, more particularly inthe production of food-stuffs formerly imported. What we have in mind as apermanent measure is a moderate expansion, say, of the order of 10 per cent, overthe pre-war level, of commodities that enter into international trade, coupled atthe same time.with an assurance to home farmers of a reasonable degree of security and stability. Whether a moderate expansion of this kind would, in fact,lead to a reduction of imports is problematical, for the general effect of themeasures of social reconstruction which we contemplate will, we hope, be toincrease the purchasing power of the community, and this in,turn should lead to increased food consumption and increased imports, our balance of payments position permitting. This we should welcome both on social and nutritionalgrounds.
7. Reviewing the position broadly both from our standpoint and from thatof other countries interested in world trade in food-stuffs, it seems to us thatthe objective which we should aim at is the creation of conditions which would effectively diminish high agrarian protection and the risk of world surpluses,unfair competition, violent fluctuations of prices and consequential dislocation of production and trade. The studies so far undertaken here indicate that ifwe are to play our part in bringing about these conditions it will not be feasiblefor a number of reasons to rely, so far as home agriculture is concerned, on asystem of Exchequer subsidies, and this would be equally true for many othercountries. The more we reflect on this problem the more we are driven to theconclusion that it may be desirable in the interests of our suppliers as well as ourselves that the rules should allow of the use of quantitative regulation ofimports, whether under private or State trading, as a means for giving a reason-able degree of stability to both home production and imports in the case of these commodities. In addition it may also be desirable for the rules to allow for a somewhat higher degree of protection for some food-stuffs than would be permissible under the original proposals.8. &quot;We are fully mindful that these modifications if introduced into thepresent commercial policy scheme as it stands would somewhat alter the balanceof the proposals. In these circumstances we feel that best course will be for our officials to explain fully and frankly to Hawkins when discussions with him areresumed the difficulties to which the Washington proposals would be likely togive rise from the standpoint of our home agriculture difficulties which in all probability would be felt even more acutely by other European countries andto explore .with him how situation could best be dealt with without prejudicing the general balance of the proposals so far discussed.9. A possibility which occurs to us is that it might be practicable tointroduce into the general proposals a section laying down a separate but relatedcode of rules for the treatment of all food-stuffs of a type entering international trade, the justification for this being the highly special conditions attaching tothe trade and the seasonal and climatic variations in agricultural output whichfind no parallel in the case of industrial production. We are attracted by this idea since our studies suggest that this method of approach might well prove to be in the best interests of world agriculture as a whole, and that withoutdeparting from the spirit of the Washington proposals a balanced code of rulescould be devised to govern international trade in food-stuffs which would be ofbenefit no less to exporting than to importing countries. Suggestion we have in mind is that degree of protection and financial assistance permissible to producers in each country might be related to a specified quantum of production for each group of food-stuffs of types which enter into international trade. Theprotection permissible on this quantum would be limited to a moderate ceiling.But all protective methods, including subsidies, would be progressively reducedso long as the specified quantum of production was exceeded. Conception under-lying these suggestions is that within prescribed production . level somewhatgreater latitude in regard to protective measures, including, if necessary, use of quantitative regulation, might be permitted than would be applicable to industrialproducts, but that, if production rises above the specified quantum, both protection and financial assistance would be progressively scaled down, a provision whichwould not be applicable to industry. This we feel would preserve the generalbalance of the proposals while at the same time assisting towards the realisation of the objectives outlined in paragraphs 4 and 7 above. We are instructing our officials to put this possibility to Hawkins in the course of the conversations withhim, and will inform you of his general reactions.ANNEX II.NON-DISCRIMINATION IN RELATION TO THE PROGRAMMING OEIMPORTS.Non-discrimination may be taken broadly to signify equality of competitiveopportunity between all would-be suppliers of a market subject to the right ofthe country concerned to protect its home producers by means of tariffs or otherprotective methods.
So long as the foreign trade of the world was in the hands of private tradersand the only method commonly employed by Governments for the protection ofhome production was that of import duties of one kind or another, it was not a difficult matter to determine whether or not such equality of opportunity wasbeing afforded. Generally speaking, it could be said that there was no discrimination if the rate of import duty imposed on any given commodity wasthe same whatever the source of origin of that commodity. Possibilities of discrimination existed for instance it was possible for an importing country toplace certain would-be supplying countries at a disadvantage by imposingdifferent rates of duty on different commodities or different types of the samecommodity which, though susceptible of classification under separate heads, infact competed for the same market.   But the fundamental criterion was clear.2. Governmental intervention in the conduct of foreign trade, which became increasingly widespread during the inter-war years, gave rise to an entirely new situation. By introducing systems of quotas and import licenses Governmentstook power to determine not only the total amounts which were to be importedbut also the sources from which they should be imported; and, when Governmentsproceeded to conduct foreign trade either themselves or through organisationsunder their control, this power became direct and absolute. Under thesecircumstances, both the possibilities of discrimination and the difficulties of devising tests by which it could be identified were greatly increased.3. During the inter-war years there were two methods of allocatingquotas or import licences which were commonly used. The first method &apos;that of the &quot;open quota,&quot; working on the principle of &quot;first come, firstserved &quot; was both disorderly and also discriminatory, in the sense that itplaced distant countries at a clear disadvantage. The second method that ofbasing the allocation of quotas or import licenses upon the shares of the tradeenjoyed by the various supplying countries in some past period was satisfactoryso long as the quantitative regulation of imports could be regarded as a temporary measure but, if applied over a considerable period of years, would in the endamount to discrimination; and, if widely adopted after the war, it might prove a grave obstacle to the efforts of this country to restore the equilibrium of itsbalance of payments. A reference to the Anglo-American Trade Agreement of1938 tends to show that, by that date, it was beginning to be recognised that neither of these methods could be regarded as satisfactory. Article 5 of that agreement, which is concerned with quantitative regulation, whilst laying chiefstress on the principle that the allocation of quotas should be based on pastperformance, stipulates that account should be taken, so far as practicable inappropriate cases, of any special factors which may have affected or may beaffecting the trade-in any particular article; and the principle hinted at inthis phrase is more fully developed in Article 8 of the same Agreement, whichis concerned with the activities of monopoly purchasing organisations and statesthat- such organisations, in making their foreign purchases of any article, shouldbe influenced solely by considerations which would ordinarily be taken intoaccount by a private commercial enterprise interested solely in purchasing onthe most favourable terms.-4. This latter principle which may conveniently be termed &quot; the doctrine of commercial considerations &quot; is one which, if it is sufficiently widely interpreted,we might do well to accept. The qualification is, however, an important one.The examples given in Article 8 of the Anglo-American Trade Agreementof the considerations which would ordinarily be taken into account by a privatecommercial enterprise are those of &apos;&apos; price, quality, marketability and terms of sale.&quot; If these examples were to be regarded as exhaustive, acceptance of the doctrine of &apos;&apos; commercial considerations &apos;&apos; would preclude an importing country from taking into account such factors as its traditional trading connections,and the need to assure the security of its future supplies factors which it isnot unreasonable to suppose that a private commercial enterprise would take into account. Clearly, neither this country nor any other importing country could be expected to bind itself to transfer a large proportion of its purchases of some commodity at a given time from its normal suppliers solely for thereason that a temporary surplus of production -perhaps artificially induced-had enabled some other country to offer exceptionally attractive terms. the doctrine of &quot;commercial considerations&quot; must, therefore, be so interpreted asto enable importing countries to avoid so dislocating the economies of their normalsuppliers as to endanger the ability of those suppliers to meet their future requirements; and, in particular, to discount to an appropriate extent occasional
offers at especially low prices, or otherwise on especially favourable terms, where these clearly arise from transitory or artificial causes.5. The view has been advanced in the course of our discussions that, now thatwe are proposing a special code of rules for the treatment of agricultural products,which in effect substitutes the conception of orderly planning and marketing^ inthe interests of the stability of home agriculture, for that of the freer competitionenvisaged under the Washington proposals as a whole, some at least of the exporting countries might feel that in order to carry this conception to its logicalconclusion there should be some specific safeguard against arbitrary and abruptchanges in sources of supply. This may be so, but, j ust as we feel that no country could be expected to bind itself to make such changes purely on the prices criterion,so we are satisfied that it would not be in the interests of this country, whether asan importer or as an exporter to markets where for purposes permitted by theconvention quantitative regulation may be applied, to take the initiative in proposing an obligation on importing countries which Would tie their hands inmaking such changes. This is a point which is unlikely to be raised by the americans since their interest will tend towards the greatest possible freedom todump their surpluses abroad, but it might perhaps be put forward by some of theDominions, whose interest will rather be to protect themselves from Americandumping in their normal export markets. In any case, however, we feel that thepoint is one which should be left to exporting countries themselves to raise; weshould hope in practice that they would be satisfied by the expanded interpretation of &quot; Commercial considerations&quot; suggested in paragraph 4 above.6. We accordingly recommend that, in any exploratory discussions whichmay take place with the Americans in the near future, officials should beauthorised to take the line that, whilst we accept the principle of non-discrimina-tion, the definition of that principle in its application to quantitative regulation and State trading will need oareful consideration; and then to develop the considerations which we have outlined in paragraph 4 above. It will, of course,also be necessary to recall that we have never interpreted our acceptance of theprinciple of non-discrimination as entailing any obligation to abolish imperial preference; and to make it plain that, in applying the principle of non-discrimination -nation to quantitative regulation or State trading, we should, of course, have tomake allowance for imperial preference within the limits of such tariff formula?as may be agreed under the tariff clauses of the convention.7. We are also of the opinion that, mutatis mutandis, the same principles ofnon-discrimination should be applied to any export quotas which may result frominternational commodity agreements. The Americans have shown a disposition(for example, in the ease of wheat) to wish to protect their high-cost exportsagainst the inroads of producers with lower costs. In the interests of the worldbalance of international payments, of our own standards of living, and of theagricultural prosperity of the Dominions, it is highly desirable that high-costAmerican exports should give place to low-cost supplies from other sources; and,although there may be arguments for moderating the speed of any such shifts, theymust not be wholly prevented. We are, therefore, agreed that, in discussing theprinciple of non-discrimination with Mr. Hawkins, it would be desirable to refer to the application of this principle to export as well as to import quotas.
