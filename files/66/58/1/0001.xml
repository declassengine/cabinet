THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 QOVEBHMEKTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. I     Copy No. 0 0A.P.        001.15 A November, 1944.WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS SPAIN.Memorandum by the-Minister of Economic Warfare.I venture to deprecate the counsel tendered by the Lord President of theCouncil in W.P. (44) 622.2. Whatever we may think of the &apos;&apos; incompetence, corruption and oppres-sion &quot; of the Franco regime, there is plenty of evidence that they are less than under the regime it displaced, and also that the Franco atrocities are fewer and less horrible than those that preceded them. Nor is there any reason to believethat Franco is more authoritarian or more severe to his political opponents than our Allies Stalin and Salazar. But even if we were in a position to deliverjudgment on these points, it would not be of great relevance.3. A policy of economic pinpricks and strangleholds against Spain would bevery unlikely to redound to our credit or benefit. I can see no moral justification for such attacks on a neutral country which has made no serious attacks upon us,and for whose non-belligerency in 1940 we are much indebted. The people whowould primarily suffer would be British traders and the people of Spain, whoseresentment we should arouse and deserve.4. The experiences of 1936 should have shown us that economic sanctionswill inevitably produce anti-foreign reaction in the country attacked, andBritish interference in Spanish domestic affairs would not be popular. Mr. hull&apos;s -incursions into Argentine domestic politics are not encouraging; and america has much more status and far greater means of &quot; peaceful persuasion &quot; in theArgentine than we have in Spain.5. What the world, and not least Spain, most need now is peace and a revival of trade. I think that we should be well advised to abstain from doing anything that would hinder the cause of either.S.Ministry of Economic Warfare, W. 1,14tth November, 1944.[28621]
