THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.. secret.P. (44) 665.IQth November, 1944.WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS SPAIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I have for some time past been disturbed by the unsatisfactory politicalsituation in Spain and I have been in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s ambassador on the subject. I enclose, for the consideration of my colleagues, a memorandum which Lord Templewood has prepared as the basis for these consultations.2. The Spanish Government, which at one stage, in 1940, seemed on thepoint of entering the war on the side of Germany, has, under constant pressure from His Majesty&apos;s Government and also of the United States Government, andin the light of the changing war situation, gradually relinquished its formerattitude of non-belligerency in favour of our enemies and finally declared itselfneutral. We have no serious complaint concerning Spain&apos;s present foreign policyand Anglo-Spanish economic relations have developed very satisfactorily on abasis of mutual advantage. Certain Spanish products, e.g., iron ore, potash andpyrites, remain of the first importance to our war effort.3. Nevertheless, and in spite of the imminence of the victory of the united nations, General Franco is showing no disposition to change the objectionablecharacteristics of his regime or to reduce the influence of the totalitarianFalangist Party on which that regime rests. The latter continue openly toparade their hostility to this country and to the cause of the United Nations.The information in my possession indicates, indeed, that General Franco is ina mood of smug complacency and that he now regards himself as more stronglyestablished than ever. He has misinterpreted the references which the PrimeMinister made to Spain in his speech to the House of Commons on the 24th Mayas an indication that his regime enjoys the support of His Majesty&apos;s Government,and he appears to be convinced that he can successfully maintain a double policyof totalitarianism in Spain and of friendly relations with Great Britain andother Allied Nations. He has exploited the recent disturbances on the Franco-Spanish frontier to his own advantage by representing himself to the Spanishpeople as the champion of law and order against the forces of revolution and disorder. Moreover,, he has recently given an interview to an American presscorrespondent designed to give the impression that Spain has maintained a policyof honourable neutrality throughout the war, repudiating all connexion withtotalitarianism and claiming that Spain is a &quot;organic democracy.&quot; The inter-view ended with a claim that neutral countries had a right to be present at thePeace Conference.4. Against this background, the Spanish Ambassador has asked to seems to make an important communication on General Franco&apos;s personal instruc-tions. The Ambassador was to have called on the 16th November, but he hasnow had to delay his call until next week owing to illness. He had, however,already given to the Permanent Under-Secretary of State an indication of thegeneral lines of his communication. This expresses General Franco&apos;s desire for an early clarification of Anglo-Spanish relations with a view to a closerand more friendly relationship in future. Although this might normally beregarded as indicating a realisation on General Franco&apos;s part of his growing-isolation, my impression is that he assumes that Great Britain needs Spain&apos;sfriendship as much as, or more than, Spain needs ours.12577   [28636] B
5. It will be impossible to leave General Franco&apos;s communication without an answer and it will in my view call for an early and a clear reply. We must therefore consider our present attitude towards Spain. There can be no doubt,as Lord Templewood points out in his memorandum, that our post-war strategic interests require a friendly and peaceful Spain. Moreover, there are importanteconomic advantages which we may expect to gain from the development of our -trade with Spain. At the same time, we cannot overlook the fact that thecontinuance of&apos; the Falange regime in Spain after the elimination of other hostiletotalitarian regimes in Europe would be an unfortunate anomaly. We do not, ofcourse, want to provoke another revolution or civil war in Spain, from which onlyextremist and very possibly anti-British elements might profit. Nor do I think we could now do this, even if we would, since Franco&apos;s main strength at presentlies in the obvious desire of the great majority of Spaniards for the maintenanceof a modicum of law and order, at almost any cost. - But unless the present regime is modified now by peaceful means, an explosion must come sooner or later,and in the long run it may only be possible to avoid such an explosion by taking action now. The most satisfactory solution, if it were practicable, would be the replacement of the present regime by a more moderate regime, whether a moderateRepublic or a Constitutional Monarchy. The information in my possessionindicates, however, that the moderate elements in Spain, whether Monarchist orRepublic, are in a depressed state of mind. They are losing hope of possibility of replacing General Franco by any means short of a recurrence of revolution, andare tending to an increasing extent to accept the existing regime in Spain with all its faults, because at least it appears to offer them comparative security.6. The only practicable possibility of an improvement in Spain would therefore appear to lie in a modification of the present regime by the eliminationor suppression of its most undesirable elements, and it is in my opinion to this end that His Majesty&apos;s Government should now be prepared to exert their influence.I therefore agree with Lord Templewood&apos;s recommendation that a solemn warn-ing should now be delivered to General Franco, the general tenour of which wouldbe that Spain cannot expect to have the place she desires in the post-war world,nor to maintain really cordial relations with this country, so long as internal conditions in Spain remain in complete contradiction to the principles for whichthe United Nations stand. It will in any case be necessary to frame our replyto General Franco&apos;s outstanding communication in such a way that no misunder-standings or wilful misinterpretations are possible. I circulate a draft for theconsideration of my colleagues. This might, of course, require minor but not, Ithink, substantial modification in the light of the detailed terms of GeneralF ranco&apos; s communication.7. If this course of action is approved, I propose to send immediateinstructions to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington to inform the UnitedStates Government, who have also recently expressed to.us their anxiety over therecent development of the Spanish internal situation, of the action which it isproposed to take and to suggest to them that they may wish to send instructionsto the United States Ambassador in Madrid to support Lord Templewood.8. I would recommend that no publicity should be given to the proposed action from British and United States sources as this would only be likely toencourage Spanish obstinacy and xenophobia, and so temporarily to strengthenGeneral Franco&apos;s position. Even without such publicity the fact that the warning had been given to General Franco would quickly become knownthroughout Spain, and would finally dispose of any false impressions that stillpersist regarding the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government.9. Such action offers, in my opinion, the only practical means of exertingpressure upon Spain to put its own house in order without (a) intervening in spanish internal affairs, (&amp;) harming our own vital interests, e.g., continuedBritish requirements of Spanish iron ore, &amp;c, (c) rallying the Spanish peoplearound Franco, or (d) provoking chaotic and revolutionary conditions in Spain.A. E.Foreign Office, 18th November, 1944.
THE ALLIED ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE FRANCO GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by Lord Templewood.MORE than four years ago I went to Madrid for the express purpose nfkeeping Spain out of the ranks of our enemies. The danger was then imminentand as long as the German army remained on the Pyrenees it continued to existto a greater or lesser extent. The Allied victories and the German withdrawal from France have now transformed the situation. There is now no risk of any military embarrassment to the Allies from the side of Spain. The express objecttherefore for which I went to Madrid is accomplished. This being so, it wouldseem that the right course is for me to retire in the near future, and to allow the Mission to revert to a more normal representation. Before, however, reaching the final and detailed decision, I desire to draw attention to a very importantissue that remains outstanding between the Allied and Spanish- Governments.I have in mind the Falange regime and the justifiable criticisms that its existenceexcites in every Allied country. With the elimination of other totalitarianGovernments in Europe the Spanish anomaly becomes more and more conspicuous.As my telegrams and despatches from Madrid will have shown, I have done mybest to warn General Franco and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the risk to Spain of isolation from the post-war regime of Western Europe. I do not,however, natter myself that my clear and insistent warnings have had any effect.On the contrary, General Franco now seems to regard himself as stronger than ever. The reckless movement of a few hundred Spanish adventurers on thefrontier has given him the chance of posing as the champion of Spain againsta Red invasion. It has also provided him with a pretext for arresting andexecuting a formidable number of his political opponents. At the same timethe Oppositions of the Right and the Left seem as impotent as ever to organise any counter-offensive. Moreover, in spite of many suggestions that the Falange wasbeing transformed into an organisation of social service, the fanatical totali-tarians are still deeply entrenched at the Party&apos;s centre, a guard of picked Partymen has been organised for General Franco, and stores of arms provided for themilitants in Madrid and other centres. These evidences seem to make it clearthat General Franco is still convinced that he can successfully maintain the doublepolicy of totalitarianism within Spain and friendly relations with the Alliesoutside.- Such a situation immediately raises a series of questions. Are the Alliesprepared to accept this double policy ? If they are not, how and when is it possiblefor them to intervene? If they intervene, are they likely to succeed? these and other similar questions occur at once- to anyone who has been in touch withSpanish affairs.   It may therefore be useful if I make my comments upon them.I begin by saying that I fully realise that Spain has&apos; now ceased to interest the Allies as a military factor in the present war. It should not, however, be forgotten that the last few years.have emphasised the strategic importance ofthe Spanish Peninsula, and the need of a friendly Spain in the new Europe.Our experiences have also shown that the Spanish economic field can provide avery favourable opportunity for British trade. Even in the blackest momentsof the last five years our economic relations have remained satisfactory, withthe result that our war effort was considerably assisted by the exchanges betweenGreat Britain and Spain. Any political decision, therefore, that may be madewith reference to the Spanish Government should take into account, firstly, theneed of a friendly Spain in our strategic plans for the future, and, secondly, theeconomic advantages that have been gained in the past and may be still further developed in the future provided that there is no breach between the twoGovernments.Whilst these considerations would point to a policy of letting sleeping dogslie, there are other arguments that weigh on .the side of more definite action.There is in particular the strength of public opinion in Allied countries. Publicopinion, rightly resentful against the Falange regime, is certain to become increasingly hostile with every step in the liberation of Western Europe. Thesigns are already apparent in France, where I imagine considerable pressurewill be applied to the De Gaulle Government by the many sections of anti-Francoopinion in France, both French and Spanish. I assume that this anti-Francofeeling will everywhere gain ground and may well make it difficult for the allies to keep their economic relations with Spain in a watertight compartment andto separate them from political issues. We may therefore be forced into action by public opinion.   If this is a possibility, should not the Allied Governments[28636] . b 2
consider without delay the expediency.of some further pressure on the SpanishGovernment? If action is to be taken, it should be carefully concerted upon an agreed plan rather than forced upon individual Governments by public pressure.I ask this question as I am nervous of isolated and ill-considered action. If weare to succeed, the pressure must be joint and simultaneous, and it must be applied in a way that will not mobilise Spanish opinion behind General Franco. Thepresent events on the Pyrenees frontier are&apos;an excellent example of the dangerof sporadic and isolated action. Their only result has been to strengthenGeneral Franco and the Falange regime. Another good example was the failureof the American Government to move in step with us over the question of wolfram exports. More recently, at the very moment when I was telling theMinister for Foreign Affairs that the Falange gravely obstructed good relationsbetween England and Spain, my American colleague was telling General Francothat the United States Government was very well pleased with the Spanishattitude towards outstanding questions. These instances, and I could easily add to them, show the necessity of a united Allied policy and united Allied action.Past experience also shows the necessity of avoiding methods that are certain to excite the most obstinate Spanish resistance. Time after time we have seen the boomerang effects of threats when applied to the Spanish Government. It istherefore very necessary that the Allies should take to heart the lessons of this experience and agree upon the methods that are most likely to influence general franco.If it is decided to attempt Allied pressure, I would suggest action on thefollowing lines : Firstly, we should maintain the position that it is not thebusiness of the Allies to dictate the form of the Spanish Government. Secondly,however, we should state that, whilst a country is free to have whateverGovernment it likes, a country that does not conform with the basic principlesof the new order cannot expect to be regarded as a member of the comity ofEuropean Nations. If Spain wishes to be a member of the European Club,General Franco should be clearly told that these are the rules that Spainmust keep.A number of incidental questions and criticisms probably occur to anyone who considers the practicability of the line that I am suggesting. Should, forinstance, publicity be given to any such warning? Judging from Americanexperiences in the past, immediate publicity would do more harm than good.My present suggestion, therefore, would be that General Franco should be given a locus poenitentice before being pilloried to the world. Again, is general franco likely to pay any more attention to this warning than to any previouswarning ? This is a very difficult question to answer. On the one hand, he willpoint to the totalitarianism of our two allies, Russia and Brazil, and claim thatSpanish Falangism is milder than their regimes. On the other hand, he will claim that anarchical Spain needs a relentless and centralised system of law and order.His objections will make it the more necessary for us to concentrate upon broad principles, particularly the two great needs of certain basic rights for individuals, and the Rule of Law.In any case, we must contemplate the possibility of his refusing or, still more likely, ignoring our representations. We should therefore clear our minds as towhat should be the next step in this event. My present view would be to movegradually rather than by some sudden coup. If this were to be our line, it wouldbe well for the economic experts to be studying the necessary measures. Sanctionshave a way of being double-edged, and it is therefore essential that the questionof economic pressure upon Spain should be thoroughly investigated.Having stated the problem, I now bring this note back to the personal aspectfrom which I started. Supposing that the Allied Governments decided to makea communication of the kind that I am suggesting to General Franco, it mightbe well for them to use the occasion of my farewell visit to the Caudillo to makeit. Without arrogating to myself any credit for what has happened in Spain,I can claim that the prestige of the British , Embassy is admitted by everySpaniard, and that, this being so, a solemn communication made by me at the endof my Spanish chapter would almost certainly carry more weight that a communi-cation made in Washington or London, or by my newly arrived successor. In anycase, I throw out the suggestion, and I a,dd that, if it were accepted, I would beready to return to Madrid for the purpose not only of taking my leave of theGovernment and my many Spanish friends, but also of transmitting this solemnwarning to General Franco. 0lQth October, 1944.
Draft Letter from the Prime Minister to General Franco.Your Excellency,I have studied with great interest your Ambassador&apos;s recent importantcommunication in which he informed His Majesty&apos;s Government of YourExcellency&apos;s desire for a clarification of Anglo-Spanish relations with a viewto a closer and more intimate relationship in the future. It is my own desire,and indeed that of all my colleagues in the War Cabinet, that Anglo-Spanishrelations should be close and cordial, and I welcome Your Excellency&apos;s suggestionthat the time is ripe for some clarification of the position. It is accordingly after full consultation with my colleagues and in the name of the War Cabinet thatI take the opportunity of Lord Templewood&apos;s farewell visit to Spain to set out to Your Excellency in complete frankness the serious difficulties which stillhamper the satisfactory development of relations between our two countries.2. I must first remind Your Excellency of the policy which your Governmenthas pursued so far in the present world war, as this policy has appeared to HisMajesty&apos;s- Government and to the British public, which they represent. I do notforget that Spanish policy did not oppose us at two critical moments of the war,namely, at the time of the eollapse of France in 1940, and at the moment of theAnglo-American invasion of North Africa in 1942. But I cannot overlook thefact that for the greater part of the war German influence in Spain has constantlybeen permitted to embarrass the war effort of Great Britain and of her Allies, andthat a Spanish Division was actually sent to give active assistance to our Germanenemies against our Ally Russia. During that period the Spanish Governmentopenly professed a policy not of neutrality but of non-belligerency, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government, with the example of Italy before them, could hardlyharbour sentiments of complete confidence regarding the ultimate intentions of spain.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government have had many complaints to make againstunneutral activities in Spain, e.g., the use of Spanish harbours and territorial waters by enemy submarines, the refuelling and other facilities afforded to thosesubmarines, the failure of the Spanish Government to intern enemy ships or toprevent the activities of German saboteurs and agents on Spanish soil. TheSpanish Government did not in our view deal fairly and expeditiously with ourrepeated and justified complaints, and at this moment we are still awaiting thecomplete fulfilment of the undertakings in respect of German agents accepted by your Government in the agreement of last May. Moreover, the Spanish Govern-ment, by its action in Tangier, arbitrarily interfered with the rights of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and of British subjects in that Zone. Again, the SpanishGovernment gave countenance to quisling Governments set up by our enemies,for example, in Croatia, Slovakia and the Philippines, whilst it withdrew officialrecognition from legitimate Allied Governments, recognised as such throughoutthe world. The Spanish Government persecuted Allied sympathisers in spain and penalised several British subjects who had lived peaceably in Spain formany years. Finally, throughout this period your Excellency, in a series ofspeeches disparaged the Allied democracies and spoke of their defeat as beingboth desirable and inevitable.4. I have, of course, been happy to observe the notable and favourablechange in Spanish policy towards this country effected under your Excellency&apos;sguidance during the tenure of office of the late General Jordana. But HisMajesty&apos;s Government cannot gloss over the past now that the war is drawing toa close, and when plans are being made for the future of Europe.5. I am, however, less concerned with the past than with the present and withthe future, and my desire is to see all barriers removed which stand in the wayof closer Anglo-Spanish relations. Therefore, while formally disclaiming any intention on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government of intervening in Spanishinternal affairs, it is my duty to point out that the development of really friendly relations with Spain, which His Majesty&apos;s Government desire, is impossible solong as internal conditions in Spain remain in contradiction to those principles for which the United Nations stand, my own conception of which was set out ina message which I delivered on the 29th August at the end of my last visit toItaly. I need not particularise the many respects in which present conditions inSpam differ from that conception. These are, of course, matters for the SpanishGovernment and for the Spanish people and His Majesty&apos;s Government will certainly not attempt to intervene in such domestic concerns.  But while, for what-
ever reason, these conditions obtain, there can be no question of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment supporting Spanish claims to participate in the eventual peace settle-ment. Nor  loes it seem to me likely that an invitation would be forthcoming, andthe necessary support assured, for the admission of Spain to the future world organisation. These matters are not, of course, the sole concern of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, but, speaking as I do for them I am bound to say that it seems tome impossible for Spain to be accepted and regarded as one of those nations,around whom the future structure of world peace must be built, until Spaingenuinely embraces the basic tenets and principles for which the United nations are now fighting and which will be reaffirmed by their victory.6. I would, in conclusion, beg your Excellency to believe that I would nothave ventured to put the above considerations so frankly to you were it not for your Excellency&apos;s own recently-expressed desire for a clarification of Anglo-Spanish relations and for my conviction that a close friendship is necessarybetween our two countries and that it can only be created and maintained withinthe framework of the principles which I have sketched out for your Excellency&apos;consideration.
