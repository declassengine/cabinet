this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1^14.---:-,-A-SECRET.        . v/ Copy No. 2 2W.P. (44) 668.21st November, 1944.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR FINANCE FOR INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE Steering Committee in their report on Post-War Employment drew attention in an Appendix (which for convenience is reprinted below) to theneed for the provision of special financial arrangements to assist small industrialfirms, including farmers, and also major schemes of industrial reorganisation.2. The report mentioned the &quot; gap &quot; (sometimes known as the MacmillanGap because it was discussed in the Macmillan report on Finance for Industrypublished in 1931 (Cmd. 3897)) in the ordinary financial arrangements for small firms who might require capital from  5,000 up to, say,  200,000. Apartfrom other reasons the expenses of obtaining such sums from the Capital Issuemarket would be prohibitive and the capital market should, in principle, be reserved for larger operations. Bank advances are held to be too uncertain andtoo liable to recall in the event of economic difficulties, although those difficulties might not be affecting the firms directly concerned.A few attempts in the inter-war years were made by special institutions toprovide working&apos; capital for smaller industrial businesses but they did not cover the ground adequately.The Steering Committee&apos;s report also emphasised the importance to employment Policy of the widely distributed, stable, and large volume ofemployment afforded by tihe smaller industrial units Which are often wellmanaged and enterprising.3. There is a similar need for provision of finance for industrial recon-struction. Despite the high levels of taxation of recent years a number of firms have appreciable resources and others are in a strong enough credit positionto be able to obtain capital from the market in the ordinary way. But somecases of reconstruction involve rather large sums and in many instances thecapital cannot immediately become fully remunerative : the new Company needs to be nursed for a period while the development&quot; secured by the new capitalis maturing.4. The Steering Committee recommended that an attempt should be madeto secure institutions with private capital which would work in close co-operationwith the Government Departments concerned, although it was recognised thatin certain circumstances financial assistance from the Government would berequired.5. I have now received a letter from the Governor of the Bank of Englandinforming me that as a result of &quot;a discussion with the appropriate interests heis in a position to make two proposals for the formation of a special company to provide long-term finance for small industrial and agricultural enterprises,and of a separate Company to provide similar finance for larger businesses andfor reorganisation and reconstruction.6. The proposals of the Governor have been fully discussed at two meetingsof the Reconstruction Committee and I might therefore summarise them quitebriefly.7. Company &quot; A &quot; for small businesses would be created by the Clearing-Banks with a capital of  10 to  15 million and borrowing powers of twice[28649] b
that figure, making total resources of  30 to  45 million. The Bank ofEngland would contribute part of the capital but neither that Bank nor the clearing Banks would control the Company which would be managed quiteseparately, having its own carefully chosen Board of Directors and appropriatestaff, consisting of business men and technical experts qualified to examine theposition and prospects of businesses applying for financial assistance and tohelp in the formulation of their projects.8. Company &quot; B,&quot; for finance for industrial reorganisation, would be financed mainly by Investment Trusts and Insurance Companies, the Bank ofEngland taking an important participation. It is not contemplated that the clearing Banks would subscribe to this Company. The capital proposed is from 20 to  30 million with borrowing powers three times that figure, giving totalinitial resources of  80 to  120 million.9. This Company would also be independently managed by a Board of directors chosen from men of experience in commerce, industry and finance, andwould have attached to it an Advisory Panel of men connected with industry,on the side both of management and of labour, to whom it could look for advice on general questions. The Directorate would work in the closest co-operationwith the Government Departments concerned, and their activities would at all times be fully correlated to Government policy in the national interest. the governors letter states that the Company would be run on the broadest possible basis consistent with reasonable commercial prudence.Both these Companies would be in addition to the existing financial agenciesfor the supply of capital.10. At their meeting on the 16th November (R (44) 72nd Meeting) theCommittee welcomed both plans. The Committee recognised that Company &quot; A &quot;represented an attempt on the part of financial institutions to fill the MacmillanGap, and that Company &quot; B &quot; would prove of great value in stimulating andassisting industrial reorganisation, especially in view of the insistence by theGovernor &quot;of the Bank that the Company would not be unduly influenced by purelyfinancial considerations, but would rest its policy upon wide judgment ofindustrial and technical issues, keeping closely in step with the general employ-ment policy of the Government.11. Subject, therefore, to the approval of the War Cabinet I should proposeto reply to the Governors letter accepting his offer and asking him to completehis negotiations as rapidly as possible.In my reply I should call attention to the following points  -[a) The Government might find it necessary to embark upon special schemesfor the financing of reorganisation in the case of one or two industries where the conditions were peculiarly difficult and important. (Thisis an assumption which the Governor understands and accepts.)(&amp;) The Government attach great importance to assistance to small businesses. Although the assistance which Company &quot; A&quot; will afford will primarily be for existing small enterprises which haveshown their capacity, it is assumed that it will also be available for new applicants whose past experience and record indicate that theywill be capable of making good use of the help given to them.(c) The Government would wish that special attention should be given toapplications for the expansion or establishment of industrialbusinesses in the Development Areas.id) The Government regard it as essential that Company &quot; B &quot; should have aDirectorate chosen from men of experience in industry and commerceas well as in finance, and that the Directorate should co-operate closely with the appropriate Government Departments. The Governmenttake note that it is intended that this Company should conduct its business on the broadest possible basis consistent with reasonablecommercial prudence. In this connection the Government welcome the idea of the proposed Advisory Panel.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,21st November, 1944.
ANNEX.(Reprinted from Appendix A to R (44) 6.)FINANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND FOR REORGANISATION.Finance for Small Businesses.1. Broadly speaking, businesses needing loan or share capital of less than 200,000 cannot afford the expenses of a public issue and do not normally makeapplication to the market at that stage of their financial development. Some ofthose who need between  100,000 and  200,000 have been able to obtain money onvarying terms from a few of the insurance companies and. from some investmenttrusts. But for the smaller sums the firms depend, both for their working anddevelopment capital, upon their profits, upon the ability and willingness of the proprietors and their associates to put their private resources at risk, and uponassistance from the banking system. The availability of private finance either from within the firms&apos; trading results or from the private resources of the proprietors is, of course, affected by the general issues of industrial and personaltaxation to which we have referred in another place. It seems to us that under present conditions there is little doubt that industrial development must, in its initial stages, rely to an increasing extent upon the institutional investor, whetherthe banks or some other instrument of the financial system.2. The Macmillan Committee suggested that there was a gap in thescheme for providing finance for the small industrial business. The evidencethat the Clearing Banks and other financial agencies have really failed in providing money for small business is inevitably difficult to discover, but it maywell have been that there was a residual field where there was a gap in thefinancial provisions before the war. It is true that there had been developments of special institutions to provide finance for industry, but for various reasonsthese did not cover the greater part of the field with which we are at the momentconcerned, or at any rate not on terms that made them fully useful. We thinkit likely that the previous gap may become rather wider after the war.3. We have considered carefully whether the finance required for thisresidual field of small businesses should be provided by private finance or by apublic institution using public money. We are agreed in thinking that everyeffort should be made to secure that it is provided by the financial mechanism.If there is really a continuing gap in the provisions made by the existing financial system the-only sensible solution in the long run is to try to make that system fill the gap. There are obvious difficulties in the way of a Government-financed institution for these residual cases. There would be a tendency for itto be loaded with the most doubtful risks and to be exposed to considerable pressure to become a concealed form of financial patronage; it would probablyprove difficult in many oases for it to apply tests of reasonable expectation offinancial success. A private financial institution can take full advantage of itssuccessful ventures and so offset its losses, thereby enabling it to average itsfacilities over the field at a reasonable charge. But a Government institution on what would inevitably be a controversial field would be subject, and no doubtEroperly, to critical comment from Parliament if its judgments were shown toe wrong in a number of cases and it had lost public money upon them. A defence that, on the other side of the account, considerable profits were being made fromthe Government^ shares in a number of small enterprises might not appeal tothe competitors of those enterprises.4. In so far as the finance must ultimately be found from the resources ofthe Clearing Banks who alone are capable of providing it in sufficient amount,two difficulties must be faced. These small businesses want long-term capital,either in the form of share capital or loan capital. It is a well-tried principle ofthe Clearing Banks in the British system to avoid taking up, save in very exceptional cases, loan or share capital direct, and we should not wish to proposea scheme which would conflict with this principle of liquidity. The insurance companies&quot; or investment trusts which have in the past invested funds in industrial ventures may well hesitate before embarking upon the complications of investment in a diffused number of small enterprises in whose management theycould scarcely be able to participate.[28649] B 2
5. Further, it is alleged to be a defect of the methods of the clearing banks, especially under the centralised system of administration which hasresulted from the inter-war amalgamations, that too often they appear to base their willingness for financial accommodation either upon the pledge of collateralsecurity which ties up the free assets of the firm, or upon the profit and lossaccount of the past. Obviously the record in the past is a very material factor in deciding whether to put money into the venture, but for what we have in mind the judgment of industrial possibilities and trading prospects must not berelegated to a secondary place. It used to be said that in the past, before thebank amalgamations, it was easier to obtain accommodation money with areasonable certainty that it would be regularly renewed because the BankManager acted upon his personal knowledge of his client: now it is said he actsin accordance with regulations sent to him by his headquarters. However thatmay be, what is wanted is a technique which can examine the prospects of theapplicant with close knowledge of his circumstances and character.6. If the difficulties mentioned are to be met, as we believe they should bemet, through private finance, it may prove desirable to have a special financialinstitution in which no doubt the Clearing Banks would have to participatelargely. This institution would apply to the provision of relatively small amounts of domestic capital for use by small businesses some part of the techniquethat was traditionally applied by the Issuing Houses to large foreign investmentsfor development.7. We have considered whether it would be practicable to make use of oneinstitution both for financing small business and for financing larger schemes of reorganisation. If such a dual purpose institution could be set up there would be some advantages, particularly in the economy of personnel, for the management of such an organisation will require considerable personal ability. But on thewhole we have come to the conclusion that the provision of finance for smallbusiness, and for larger schemes of industrial organisation, are two jobs, andshould be undertaken by two distinct institutions.8. The exact .form which should be taken by the institution for financingsmall business cannot be determined in this report for the plan would require careful discussions with various financial interests. But we have reason to hopethat such an institution could be set up with adequate capital, and in the general interests of .the relations between finance and industry would be found willing totake a liberal view of applications; the institution would have to maintain close relations with the Treasury and the Board of Trade.9. We think it important to state three general principles for the finance of small businesses. We think it necessary that any organised scheme for thispurpose must base itself upon the existence of a going concern which wishes to expand, and can show reasonable prospects of successful expansion. Whether ornot it would be practicable later for the institution we suggest in paragraph 6to develop an expertness enabling it to invest new money in an entirely newenterprise must depend upon experience. At any rate, this is not what wesuggest at the first trial.10. The second principle is that it should be a condition of assistance thatthe proprietor, or his associates, when applying for financial assistance should be shown to be putting at risk part of his own&apos;resources.11. There is another desirable principle for such an institution, that itshould charge to its administrative overheads the costs of investigation into the credit-worthiness of the applicants for assistance. No doubt these charges willbe relatively heavy, and to the extent to which they are charged to the lendinginstitution they diminish the return upon the capital of the institution. But ifthey are charged to the applicant or even spread by a percentage charge on allloans, then in many cases they will make the terms of the assistance too restrictiveto be of full value. Here again we may hope that if an institution of the kindwe contemplate were set up it would accept this principle, at any rate in thebeginning, and to a large extent.Finance for Reorganisation.12. For reorganisation we consider that the same general principle shouldbe adopted, of relying upon private finance.   There may be two risks in this
policy, that in certain cases what may be termed &apos;&apos; business considerations &apos;&apos; mayconflict with considerations of social policy, in particular those affecting the location of industry, and that insufficient regard may be paid to the broaderconsiderations of industrial efficiency.13. Reorganisation schemes of the larger kinds will need additional capital,and very often will have to be-financially nursed for a time until they are in aposition to go to the capital market with good prospects of obtaining their money.14. In general terms it should be for the industries which are reorganisingthemselves to find development capital from their own resources, for it is they whowill first benefit from the reorganisation, but we believe that provision must bemade for financial assistance from outside industry. For the financial support ofimportant developments we believe that there will have to be some special financialinstitution. But while this institution would be financially entirely independent of the Government we are assuming that it would establish confidential relationswith the Board of Trade and the Treasury and other Government Departmentsconcerned which would enable the Government to be aware of schemes whichhave been brought to the institution. Y/e do not think it necessary to make allreorganisation and concentration schemes subject to prior and formal approval by the Board of Trade, but it is obviously important that the Government should know what is going on and should be in a position, if necessary, to use its influence. We would expect that the closer relationship which will exist betweenthe Government and industry after the war would generally enable some Depart-ments of the Government to become aware of such schemes before they proceedtoo far. Large schemes may require ultimately approach to the capital market,and if so they will come under, the Capital Issues Control for so long as theControl lasts. For some time also the objects of bank advances will be under some general control.15. We believe that it should be possible for arrangements to be made forsome institution (which perhaps might be called the Industrial ReconstructionFinance Corporation) on the lines of the Bankers&apos; Industrial DevelopmentCompany to be revived, with largely increased financial resources drawn from various parts of the ordinary financial system, but with important modifications of its previous policy. Broadly, the Bankers&apos; Industrial Development Companycame into operation when the industries concerned, or more strictly a number of firms in those industries, were in considerable financial difficulties. We do not contemplate that reorganisation should be dependent upon prior bankruptcy.As we have said in Chapter VI (v) where we discuss the functions of an IndustrialCommission, the Board of Trade or some other Department may have institutedenquiries into the reorganisation of an industry which prima facie appears to need reorganisation from the point of view of industrial efficiency. In many caseswe would assume that the negotiations which would produce the reorganisation,and the finance which would both support the reorganised industry and wouldbe a sanction to induce the reorganisation on the plan desired, could be securedthrough an Industrial Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the kind we con-template. It will be seen that we do not separate the provision of finance from the negotiation of the desired reorganisation. It cannot be expected that any financialinstitution should undertake to provide finance for a scheme which it does notbelieve has reasonable hopes of financial stability. Moreover, experience showsthat on the major schemes of reorganisation questions arise at every stage aboutthe new financial structure of the enterprises in the scheme, and often upon thefuture position of the personalities in the various firms. For these reasons webelieve that where there is to be recourse to private finance the financial institutionshould have an active share in the reorganisation. This seems to us absolutely necessary in many cases, because while in the end it may be expected thatsecurities of the reorganised businesses will be placed upon the investment market,the institution itself may have to nurse the business financially during theformative years.16. If, as we hope, an institution of this kind could be established withthe co-operation of financial organisations and prominent industrialists, webelieve it could play an invaluable part in the difficult problems of reorganisation and the provision for its finance.17. In the case of the institution for small businesses we suggested theprinciple that the costs of investigation should be charged to the overheads ofthe institution and not to the borrower.   We should, of course, welcome the
acceptance of a similar principle in the case of a Corporation dealing with major schemes of reorganisation. But we recognise that in some instances the technicalexamination may be relatively costly to the institution though it would not be avery material part of the capital involved in the new reconstructed enterprise.Therefore we think that the allocation of charge for the investigation expensesmight be left to the circumstances of each case.18. In paragraph 14 above we have referred to the importance of knowingbeforehand so far as possible what are the plans of industry for amalgamation,concentration or reorganisation, and we have dismissed as unnecessary, and indeed impracticable, a requirement that all such plans should be formallyapproved beforehand. But we would not see great difficulty in ensuring that theIndustrial Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the kind we contemplate should maintain records and other information which should be available confidentiallyto the appropriate Government Department. Indeed, the institution will need to work in close relation with several Departments of the Government and,provided that what they are doing remains confidential, and that the institutionis left free from doubt whether the Government proposes to intervene or not,we should expect an exchange of views and information to be a regular part ofthe relationship between the Government and the Corporation.Financial Participation by the State. -19. Although we have assumed for the purposes of this argument that thenew financial institution for assisting reorganisation will keep in close contact with the Government, it follows from the fact that private money only is engagedthat the institution must generally shape the reconstruction in the way most likely to be financially successful within a reasonable time. It must be recognised,however, that there may arise cases where in the judgment of the Governmentgeneral considerations of social policy, such as location, or of industrial policy,require *an industrial development on lines rather different from those whichmight normally be followed by the Industrial Reconstruction Finance Corpora-tion. If there were such a clash of objectives it might be necessary for theGovernment to offer some measure of financial assistance in order to secureadherence to the general policy required.20. Obvious difficulties arise when the State participates in the commercialrisks either of a whole industry or of a group of firms within an industry. Forthis reason financial assistance from the State for the purposes of industrial reorganisation of privately-owned enterprises should not be too easy to obtain, forotherwise there will be a tendency to invoke it when it is not really justifiable.On the other hand, it must not be so difficult to obtain that necessary schemes aredelayed or are drawn up with inadequate attention to more general considerations.21. We have considered three alternative principles on which financialassistance might be given by the State to industry, all on the assumption that forits purposes an Industrial Reconstruction Finance Corporation as outlined above will have been in operation.22. One alternative is for the State to take some financial participation inthe Finance Corporation in order that it may be able, for example, to nominateon to the Directorate and to influence its policy where desired. It wouldbe important, if this alternative were to be accepted, that the Government financeshould, so to speak, stand behind private finance, so that the private finance couldapply proper tests to proposals for assistance and take the first shock of the resultsof its judgment. At first sight this alternative has attractions, and it may even be urged as inevitable if the amount of capital involved for the reorganisation ofindustry is very large. We see some difficulties in operating a scheme of this kind,but if it is regarded as entering the realm of practical politics the lines on whichit would be feasible could be worked out in closer detail.23. The second alternative is that the Board of Trade should have enablinglegislation under which it could, with the consent of the Treasury, give financialassistance by appropriate Orders in each case. Such an alternative has the merits of speed and simplicity. But if the Special Orders are to be on traditional lines,i.e., that Parliament can only accept or reject them but cannot amend them, wethink the procedure would arouse opposition in Parliament. There is also^some doubt whether Parliament would be willing that public money should be applied for these purposes by Special Order procedure.
24. The third alternative is that where the financial assistance of the state is required, and we assume that this would generally be in circumstances wherethe sums of money required are large, that is for major schemes of reorganisa-tion conforming to particular lines of general policy laid down by the Government,a special Act of Parliament should be passed for each case. Parliament shouldbe made fully aware of the circumstances, and could discuss them, before public money is committed.25. It must be admitted that ad hoc legislation on matters of this kind is inevitably slow. If the schemes for which special State assistance is requiredare few, and mainly far-reaching schemes involving important issues of industrial policy as well as large sums of money, then the slowness of special legislation isnot a decisive objection. But if it is found that statutory sanction and help from public funds are required on a larger number of diverse schemes of varyingimportance, the appropriate procedure in Parliament will need further examination.
