THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY QF-HIS BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.F. (44) 669.21st November, 1944;WAR CABINET.STREET LIGHTING IN&quot; LONDON.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power. .;THE War Cabinet should be aware of certain practical difficulties involvedin the relaxation of street lighting restrictions in London. Approximately60 per cent, of the street lamps in London are gas lit. Conversion of theselamps to the required standards (as set out in W.M. (44) 147th Conclusions,Minute 4) would involve a considerable amount of work which could only he carried out by gas fitters. These are men of some skill, and such of them as are available are almost entirely engaged at present in restoring gas services to bombed houses.2. Failing a considerable increase in the number of gas. fitters availablein London, the work of conversion would take a considerable time to carry out;the Gas Light and Coke Company estimate that at least one hour would be needed for each lamp, and they alone would have 50,000 lamps to convert.3. I have been in communication with the Minister of Labour and NationalService on the acute labour difficulties of the London Gas Undertakings andI am already seriously concerned at the possibility that Londoners, for thisreason, may not receive adequate gas supplies during the present winter. annex an extract from a letter which has been sent by the Gas Light and CokeCompany to thirty-five local authorities, in which it is pointed out that &quot; theavailable labour is barely sufficient to meet gas manufacture and urgent installa-tion and maintenance demands.&quot;4. If the labour required for the conversion of street lamps is not madeavailable, an alternative would be to restore the peacetime standard. Thiswould not involve the difficult conversion of the lamps to -02 foot candles. Iunderstand, however, that this is ruled out for reasons of security.5. The responsibility for initiating conversion rests with LocalAuthorities. Many of these, I understand, are reluctant to incur the expenditure involved when a further change in lighting standards, involving additional expenditure and delay, may be expected at &quot;the end of the war with Germany.6. Where lamps are lit by electricity the same difficulty, does not arise,since it is possible to instal bulbs of low wattage and paint them over. This is comparatively simple, cheap and unskilled work, and the conversion of electricstreet lamps will therefore proceed more rapidly.G. Ll.

ANNEX,Extract from* a Letter sent to Thirty-five Local Authorities withGas Street Lighting.The Gas Light and Coke Company,Dear Sir, - 13th November, 1944.I have received a copy of the Ministry of Home Security&apos;s CircularH.S.C. 134/44, dated the 8th November, 1944, which grants to Local authorities the discretion to introduce the higher standard of lighting; and, should yourCouncil decide to do this, you may rest assured of our fullest possible co-operation.I think, however, it would be helpful to your Council in reaching a decisionto know that the conversion of the lamps to dim-out lighting would involvealterations to the burner and the painting of part of the glass. The cost of this,together with the reconversion to full lighting, would fall on the Council andwould average approximately  2 per lamp.Moreover, the labour position in the Company is acute and, whilst every endeavour would be made to &quot;complete the work as quickly as possible, theavailable labour is barely sufficient to meet gas manufacture and urgent installa-tion and maintenance demands; the carrying out of the conversion would be dependant on the availability of the necessary skilled and semi-skilled workmen.During the war years your Council have met an expenditure to maintainthe public street gas lamps in a reasonable condition of readiness for full lightingat short notice, and I think it only right to point out that the introduction ofdim-out lighting would cause an appreciable delay in restoring full pre-warlighting.^ ^ ^ tfr&apos; ^Yours faithfully;(Signed) A. E. SYLVESTER,Managing Director.
