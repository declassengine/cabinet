THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY/.S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944_MiSECRET. Copy No.. o uW.P. (44) 677.22nd November, 1944.WAR CABINET.NEW ZEALAND-AUSTRALIA CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE War Cabinet at its meeting on the 13th November (W.M. (44) 149thConclusions, paragraph 10) approved the despatch to Australia and NewZealand of a telegram in the terms annexed to my paper W.P. (44) 641 on thesubject of the declaration published on behalf of the two Governments regardingcolonial administration.2. I now annex copies of telegrams from Australia and New Zealandreplying to that telegram (Annex I).3. The two Governments argue in defence of their action. Their repliesraise a number of debating points, which it seems unnecessary to pursue. - Theyignore, however, almost entirely the main issue, namely, the objection to publication without prior consultation. At the same time they explain thatthey had not meant to support the setting up of an international body inrelation to colonial territories which would interfere with sovereignty and control by the parent States.3. In the circumstances I think that it would be desirable to send a further telegram to the two Governments as in the draft which I annex (Annex II).4. We should follow this up as soon as possible by sending -further com-munications, as promised in the draft telegram, regarding their proposals for setting up a regional Colonial Organisation in the South Pacific.* We shouldalso, as soon as we are in a position to do so, transmit to them our generalproposals for future international co-operation in colonial matters. These are under consideration departmentally, and it is hoped to bring them shortly beforethe Armistice and Post-War Committee as a preliminary to examination bythe War Cabinet. Another question arising out of the Wellington conference which they have pressed is a proposal for international discussions on the subjectof full employment. This is the subject of a separate paper now before theWar Cabinet (W.P. (44) 676).(Signed) C.Dominions Office, 22nd November, 1944.ANNEX I.Telegram No. 310 of 19th November from Commonwealth Government.No. 310.   Top Secret.Your telegram No. 325 makes no reference to our conversations with NewZealand except on the one side of Mr. Fraser&apos;s statement on Colonial mandates.Policy of Australia on this point has been consistent, but this fact receives littlerecognition in the telegram. The United Kingdom High Commissioner atWellington was consulted by Mr. Fraser before latter released statement to press,and statement was modified by Mr. Fraser subsequently.* See W.P. (44) 681.[28670] B
2. Mr. Fraser&apos;s statement was an expression of a joint objective which both governments have frequently urged, both publicly and privately. In thatexpression the two Governments exercised a well-established right relating to theconduct of the foreign policy of a Dominion.3. Turning to Cable 325, we point out that, in the first place, the basicprinciple of all the resolutions adopted at Wellington on Colonial policy hadalready been expressed in the Australian-New Zealand Agreement [videclause 28). That agreement has been on public record since the beginning of thisyear. It has never been varied by the Australian and New Zealand governments and could be varied only with consent of both Governments. Moreover, that agreement was cordially received by the British press and by Dominions secretary in House of Lords.4. Secondly, after the proposal for a declaration on Colonial policy was first put forward in the latter part of 1942, we fully advised you by govern-mental telegram of our views in particular, respecting the principle of trusteeship. In subsequent exchanges we gave every evidence of our anxiety toreach a common policy with you in this question. The suggestion for a joint declaration was apparently abandoned (in circumstances never explained to us),but some months later a unilateral announcement was made on 13th July, 1943,in the House of Commons. We were not informed of the reason for this procedure, nor were we given notice that a statement was to be made. Had webeen consulted, as should be clear from our previous telegrams (particularly our telegram No. 2, 2nd January, 1943), we would certainly have commented on the omission from the statement of 13th July, 1943, of any reference to the principleof trusteeship.5. Your reference to Prime Ministers&apos; Conference is noted. However, itwas most clearly and specifically stated by you and understood that the meetingof Prime Ministers last year was merely a personal exchange of views without commitment of Governments to any decisions on foreign policy. In any case, the record quoted by you does not bear out the contention that Mr. Curtin took theview that international supervision would be contrary to the interests of dependent peoples and parent nations. Mr. Curtin, as shown in the record,simply dissented from one particular suggestion relating to the furnishing of reports. There was not the slightest disclaimer of the broad principles of trusteeship outlined both in the Australian-New Zealand Agreement, which mr. Curtin signed as Prime Minister, and also in our confidential communica-tions to you. Moreover, as will appear from page 4 of the minutes of the tenthmeeting, Colonel Stanley himself favoured imposing an obligation on colonial powers to make reports. He added that the question of supervision could best be left on a regional basis, but it is necessary to make clear that we have neverrejected that idea of regional colonial organisation, nor have we regarded suchregional bodies as conflicting in any way with principle of colonial trusteeship,although we think it would be a mistake to give them powers of supervision.6. Incidentally, your telegram suggests that you attribute to us a proposalfor international &quot; control &quot; of Colonies. Such a term does not describe our(? view), in the expression of which we have been careful to use the term&quot; supervision &quot; as indicating a very limited and special function interfering inno way with the sovereignty and control by the parent States.7. We do not agree that limited obligations in relation to an authority setup within the framework of the proposed General International organisation would be contrary to the interests of dependent peoples and parent nations.Australia has not been prejudiced by the annual review of New Guinea by thePermanent Mandates Commission. On the contrary, this was found to be advan-tageous to Australia as well as to the native peoples. In the exchanges on colonial policy in December and January 1942-43 it seemed clear that theCanadian view on this question of supervision accorded with ours.8. We believe that trusteeship has several aspects. While the trust is primarily for the welfare of native peoples it- is also calculated to serve theinterests both of the international community generally and of the parent Stateitself. We feel that the best guarantee that Colonial Powers will fulfil theirtrust is a system comparable to the mandate system, whereby a practical work of promoting the welfare and advancement of native peoples will be regularlyexamined by an expert body which can make positive suggestions for promoting )such welfare. We believe that the British Commonwealth has everything to gain and nothing to lose by the publicity which must follow from such a system.9.   As regards some non-British Colonial Powers, we feel there is positive. necessity for some form of international review.   Mr. Churchill is recorded as
stating (page 5 of minutes of tenth meeting) that the proposed General Inter-national Organisation might be given power to take over Colonial territories fromPowers which fail to maintain reasonable standards of administration and defence. This objective could hardly be realised without adequate provision forsome form of reviewing authority or commission.10. We refer also to the British Labour Party&apos;s policy on this question as announced in March 1943. It is quite natural that the Labour Governments, bothin Australia and New Zealand, should take a similar view.11. We are reluctant to leave the matter at this point, and are willing toreceive any suggestion from you for resumption of the consultation on thisquestion which, through no act of ours, was interrupted in 1943. The Inter-national Conference on aviation has demonstrated that the British nations mayadopt differing views on foreign policy without any real prejudice to their veryintimate and special association. However, your suggestion of a separatedeclaration of United Kingdom policy at this stage might wTell be misinterpreted,particularly as there has been warm approval in Australia of the general policyexpressed both in the Australia-New Zealand Agreement and in Mr. Fraser&apos;press statement after the Wellington talks.12. Meanwhile, we will be glad to receive from you, when completed, theproposals referred to in your telegram, of which we had received no previousadvice from you. Had such advice been available, it would clearly have been a factor to be taken account of. It is possible that a suitable opportunity forfurther discussion will come with consideration of the plans for world organisa-tion. There were, of course, other more urgent matters discussed at Wellingtonbetween the Governments, and no doubt we shall hear your comments on these indue course.Telegram No. 303 of l$th November from New Zealand Government.No. 303.   Secret.We have received your telegram No. 265 of 14th November, and will give every consideration to the viewpoint expressed therein. My own views on thisquestion were made very plain at the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference, and since theyreflect the opinions of the New Zealand Government, I consider it my duty to statethem publicly. I should like to add that such views are amongst those which theNew Zealand Government would advance when invited to express their opinionon the establishment of a general security organisation.Had it been known you were about to formulate proposals yourself, theannouncement of which might be affected by our views, I can assure you that w7ewould have consulted you before publication here, but while I regret that theirpublication should give concern, I must express surprise that the UnitedKingdom Government should fear that announcement of those views, which theAustralian and New Zealand Governments regard as fundamentally sound,should cause serious difficulty and embarrassment in discussions between theUnited Kingdom and the United States Governments and in the future treatmentof the Colonial question.Should the United Kingdom Government desire to make a public statementindicating that the opinions which New Zealand and Australia have expressedare not accepted by them, I have no comment to offer, &quot;except that we are unable toexpress regret that we are unable to share each others viewpoint on this highly-important issue.There are two points arising from your telegram upon which there may bemisunderstanding. In the first place there is no reference in my statement to&quot; control by a central international body &quot; to which you refer at the beginningof the second paragraph of your telegram. Indeed, nothing in my statement, orin the conclusions of the conference, is inconsistent with the exercise of fullgovernmental authority by Colonial Powers. Secondly I had hoped that the context of my remarks would have made plain that the establishment of aninternational colonial authority was advocated on the assumption that the typeof international organisation outlined in my earlier remarks would also&quot; beaccepted. In the absence of a world security organisation of the scope and powers suggested, it would obviously be undesirable from the Security point ofview for an international body to have the right to visit colonial territories,however much this might be justified on welfare grounds. In the event, however,[28670] B 2
of the type of world organisation which we envisage being accepted, it would, inour opinion not only be right, but in the highest degree of politically wise andexpedient, for countries owning Colonies to accept the principle of accountabilityto the &quot;international authority for the welfare and advancement of native people.In the case of British Commonwealth territories I feel that we have much more to gain than to lose by conceding this point. The enlightened and liberal adminis-tration by the Colonial Office should in particular ensure the fullest support ofany responsible authority, and the acceptance of trusteeship and accountabilitywould seem essential if action is to be taken through publicity to improve the lot ofnatives in Colonial areas outside the British Empire and. Commonwealth.Though our declaration had no reference to what the United States mightpropose, we think it right, in view of your reference to the attitude of the UnitedStates, to add that, should the United States desire to make its acceptance of afar reaching security organisation, from which all Colonial Powers will benefit inrespect of security of their Colonies, dependent upon a system involving visits and reports by an international body, we should be prepared to give favourable consideration to a proposal to that effect.I do most earnestly suggest that the British Commonwealth as a whole would be committing a profound error if it did not take a lead in this questionof accountability on the interests of the welfare of Colonial peoples, and forthis reason I think it advisable to make quite clear what the attitude of the NewZealand Government would.be on this matter in any international discussions.ANNEX II.Draft Telegram to Australian and New Zealand Governments.Australia No. New Zealand No. Top Secret.Your telegram Canberra No. 310/Wellington No. 303, Statement on colonial policy.We feel that there has been some misunderstanding as to the main purposeof our telegram No. 325. It was never in our mind to question the right ofthe Australian and New Zealand Governments to make any declaration whichthey think proper on Colonial as on other aspects of public policy. But we were seriously perturbed as to the practical results which were likely to flow from theproceeding that has been adopted.2. We are glad to have this full statement of the position of the australian and New Zealand Governments in regard to the question of Colonial Policy.In particular we are glad to note that you had not contemplated an international body which would interfere with the sovereignty and control by the parent states in relation to Colonial territories. This was not clear from the published state-ment issued after the Wellington Conference.3. Our proposals for general scheme of international co-operation in colonial Policy applicable to all dependent territories are not yet complete. we will however telegraph particulars as soon as they have been fully consideredhere and approved and think you will find that they have much in common withthe views of the Commonwealth and New Zealand Governments. Difficulty whichwe saw over the announcement made after the recent V/ellington Conference wasthat it might be interpreted generally, as indeed we ourselves had interpretedit, as requiring a form of international control which in our view would conflict with the authority of the parent States. We are glad to learn that this is notin fact in contemplation.4. In paragraph 4 of Australian telegram No. 310 reference is made to thediscussions at the end of 1942 and beginning of 1943 regarding the possibility ofa joint declaration on Colonial Policy. We regret that there should have been,any misunderstanding about this. We thought that this had been made clear in statement by Colonial Secretary at Prime Ministers&apos; meetings last May.Position was that after explaining our attitude to United States authorities asindicated in our telegram D. No. 69 of&apos;9th February, 1943, matter was not pursuedfurther in any definite form by United States authorities, as preliminary andinformal talk did not disclose any basis for agreement on any form of declaration.In the circumstances although position was explained orally to Dominion repre-sentativ.es in London we did not think that point had been reached when a further communication to Dominion Governments on the subject could usefully be made.
5. Declaration of 13th July, 1943, to which reference is made was confined to question of regional councils as to which we had understood that there was general agreement on the part of Dominion Governments.6. We agree with description of purpose of principle of trusteeship as setout at the beginning of paragraph 8 of Australian telegram, but we are not clearthat these ends are necessarily served by the interposition of an international body with special- powers of investigation and supervision. As indicated above, how-ever, we hope to develop our views on this aspect more fully in the further communication promised, and shall welcome your comments.7. We are telegraphing separately regarding the proposal for the settingup of a South Seas Regional Commission.8. As regards reference in paragraph 1 of Australian telegram to consulta-tion with United Kingdom High Commissioner, Wellington, we understand that be urged the exclusion from the published statement of details of the recom-mendation on this point, but that the Australian and New Zealand representativesdid not feel able to do more than make an amendment of wording.
