3 G-J.P.(UU) 632P^RD NOVliiBBR, ,19*44- COPY NO.   -WAR CABINETARGENTINE MEAT CONTRACTMemorandum by the Minister of food . For at least the next tv/c years, and in all probability for four or five,  there will be a world meatshortage.      If we allow only 500,000 tons a year for allliberated areas there will on present estimates be a worlddeficit of about 1 million tons of meat for each of theyears 1 9U5 and 19h7.      The calculation on which this&apos;figure is based provides no increase at all in our presentmeagre meat ration here.2. No reduction in our moat ration&quot;can be contemplated.Therefore if wo do not make a long term contract with the argentines&apos; we shall nevertheless have to&apos; continue to buyfrom then the maximum quantity of meat we can obtain,  ifwe are to maintain the present civilian meat ration.      no alternative source of suppls&apos;- is available.3. Wc are thus bound in any event to take all  the meatwe can get from the Argentine and there is no substance in the vie?/ put forward by the U.S.  Government that a longterm contract will confer substantial benefits on the argentines.k. What are the advantages of such a contract to ourselves?     In the first place,  if we do not enter into such a contract, or if we postpone it, we run a very real risk of losing substantial supplies from the Argentine.Hitherto, by agreement with the Americans, we have beenin effect the only buyers of meat in the Argentine market.-&apos;A long term contract would tie down the Argentine to sellto us and only to us for four years.      Without it it isdoubtful whether we could effectively stop other countries from buying meat in the Argentine.      There are indications that not only the European allies, but some of the neutrals,  e.g.   Spain and Switzerland,  are becominginterested in this market.      Even though such purchasesmight individually be small, we might well lose up to -150,000 to 200,000 tons of meat in this way.5. The Americans may say that they can make up anydeficiency that we are likely to suffer.      But the Argentinesupplies most of our imported&apos;beef, while the Americanscan supply little but pork.      There has already been serious public complaint from consumers in this countryabout the quantity and quality of American pork they havebeen asked to take on the ration.

J. JL1 *Ministry of Pood, W.1.,23rd November, 19kU*6. The postponement of the contract will also create aserious risk that we shall only get the meat at extra costto ourselves and extra profit to the Argentines.      Thepresent price of Argentine boneless beef is about 6d.  per lb.;    that of Canadian is about 1/- per lb.     At present theArgentine is willing to carry on supplying us on a month tomonth basis&apos;at the old contract price,  but we cannot rely on their continuing to do so if the long term contract isindefinitely put off.      An extra 1  cent (or roughly -gd. )per lb.  on Argentine beef would cost the Treasury a million dollars a month.7. I realise, however,  the the Americans feel stronglyon the subject,  and I do not want to prejudice wider issuesby insisting that we should press our point of view against their opposition.      If,  therefore,  the War Cabinet thinkthat the risks of reduction in supply and of increased prices must be taken,  I am prepared to agree on lines asset out in the next paragraph.8. We should offer to postpone making any long term contract for six months (i,e.  until -the end of May),  atthe same time making it clear that at the end of thattime, in the absence of compelling new reasons to thecontrary, we must be free to resume negotiations for along term contract.      We should, however, make it clear to the Americans that we expect them to use their best endeavours to prevent other countries (including thei;;neutrals) and U.N.R,R.A.   from entering the Argentine meatIfmarket and that,  if they find it impossible to preventII this, we reserve the right to reopen the whole questionIIwith them.      As the Americans clearly recognise our .If need for meat we should also, I feel,&apos; take thisopxoortunity of getting them to agree to continue to supply the Argentine with the tin   plate and other essentialmaterials to enable us to get the supplies of meat whichwe must have.      I also consider that the Americans shouldbe asked to guarantee to supply us with such additionalmeat as is necessary to make up any deficiencies we maysuffer as a result of acceding to their views.
