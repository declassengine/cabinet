(44) 656.17th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.MAILS FOR OVERSEAS FORCES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.1. The Overseas Mails Committee has been considering the steps whichcould be taken to improve mail facilities for the Forces fighting in the Far East.The first prerequisite is additional air lift, and the Overseas Mails Committeehave asked the Air Ministry to report what additional air lift can be providedforthwith. The present air lift for mails to India and S.E.A.C. is about 2f tons per week.2. As soon as a reply is received from the Air Ministry the Overseas MailsCommittee will consider as a matter of first priority improving the mail^ecrviceservice for the Forces fighting in the Far East.3. The wider question of mail facilities for the Forces overseas after theend of the war in Europe has- recently been considered by the Overseas MailsSub-Committee and their Report, with which we concur, is submitted in an Annexhereto.Their main proposals may be summarised as follows  (i) That all letter mail for the Forces overseas should be carried by air afterthe 1st March, 1945, or at the end of the war in Europe, whichever&quot;is earlier. It is estimated that a weekly air lift of 7,200 lbs. per100,000 men would be required. Under this proposal it is recom-mended that the charge for letters for Forces overseas should be atthe rate of \\d. for the first oz., the ordinary charge for a 1-oz. letterconveyed by surface route; it is estimated that this would cover97 per cent, of the letter mail by number, though only about 50 percent, by weight. In the case of the heavier type of letter weighingover 1 oz. the sender would have two alternatives, viz., pre-paymentat the ordinary surface nate of Id. per additional oz., if surface,conveyance were desired; or at the rate of Qd. up to 1J oz. and Qd\for each additional \ oz. thereafter if air conveyance were desired,(ii) If this is impracticable, that more letter mail be put on the air bygraduated stages as more air lift becomes available. The followingstages are suggested : &apos; -(a) All-air conveyance of airgraphs (3d.) and air letters (Qd.) as atpresent, and all-air conveyance of outward l/3d. air mailletters now conveyed partly by sea : weekly air lift required 2,100 lbs. per 100,000 men.(b) All-air conveyance of air letters at reduced outward charge of 3d.,and air mail with all-air conveyance at Qd. per half-ounce :weekly air lift required 3,900 lbs. per 100,000 men.The effect per week of these proposals would be as follows per unit ofif     100,000 men per week : &apos;Air lift Loss ofrequired.

4. The Overseas Mails Committee have therefore asked the Air ministry to carry all letter mail by air for the Forces overseas as proposed in para-graph 3 (i). The Air Ministry&apos;s preliminary estimate of the total weekly airlift fequired is about 45 tons or \\ times the present figure for Forces mailsoverseas.5. As soon as a report from the Air Ministiy is available the OverseasMails Committee will report further. Meanwhile the Treasury have been invitedto examine the financial issues, and action taken by the Committee in respectof other aspects includes : (i) Steps are being taken to remove the rationing of air letters from theForces overseas.(ii) The Priority of Movements Committee have been invited to improve the channels of surface conveyance to the Far East.(iii) The Ministry of Information have been invited to pursue the possibilityof producing current newspapers for Forces in India, Ceylon and the pacific.(iv) The Post Office have been invited to try to obtain a reduction of parcelpost rates from Forces in India.(On behalf of the Overseas Mails Committee.)(Signed) EENEST BROWN.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,&apos; 17th November, 1944.ANNEX.POSTAL FACILITIES  TO AND FROM  THE  FORCES  OVERSEASAFTER THE END OF THE WAR IN EUROPE.Report by the Overseas Mails Sub-Committee.1. The Overseas Mails Sub-Committee has given urgent considerationto the question of improving postal facilities to and from Forces overseas afterthe end of the war in Europe and submits the following report to the main committee.2. The need for improved facilities has been urged on the Committee bythe Service members with special reference to Forces engaged in the Far Eastcampaign after the end of the war in Europe. The special position of these forces has been marked by the Government by pay concessions and otherwise.The present mail services, rates and approximate times of transmission to andfrom the India and S.E.A. Commands are set out in the Appendix to this paper.3. In order to maintain morale among the Forces in the Far East theService members lay particular stress on, and give high priority to, a speedy,regular and cheap mail service. They anticipate that &apos;the Forces themselves,particularly those who will be drafted to India after serving in North-west europe, will expect and claim a service comparable with that given to the BritishLiberation Army which may be summarised as the carriage of all letters by air,and, with this in mind, they formulate the requirements of Forces in the far east as follows : t &apos; (a) Air Mail.Conveyance in both directions by air of all letters not exceeding 1 oz.in weight at the rate and under the conditions at present applicable forsurface mail. For letters weighing from 1 to \\ oz. the charge for airconveyance would be Qd.; and for each additional \ oz. Qd.If this is found to be impracticable on account of the air lift involved,and it is still necessary to utilise the light-weight air letter, it is requested that the price outwards now Qd. be reduced to the price paid by theservice men homeward, i.e., 3d.
(b) Surface Mail.The requirement is that this shall be made as fast and as regular aspossible for packets and parcels. It is asked that the Priority of MovementsCommittee will to this end allow more extensive use of personnel ships forthe carriage of mails as this would appear to be essential to ensure thespeediest delivery.(c) Newspapers.(i) The demand from the services is that the main National DailyNewspapers shall be flown out in bulk for distribution underwelfare auspices as is now done in the British Liberation Army,(ii) Newspapers from the public, including local newspapers, to proceed by the fastest possible surface mail if it is quite impracticable for them to be sent by air.4. The Committee recommend in primis that steps be taken to provide forthe carriage by air of all letters not exceeding 1 oz. in weight at surface ratesand letters over 1 oz. at the charges indicated in paragraph 3 (a) by the1st March, 1945, or on the termination of the war in Europe, whichever is earlier.The Air Ministry representatives are unable to associate themselves with thisrecommendation until the air lift required for the carriage of mails has been assessed.5. It is estimated that the weekly air lift required would be of the order of ,200 lbs. per 100,000 men. At present a total weekly air lift of 22,500 lbs. onlyis allocated to Forces mail for the forces in the Mediterranean, West Africa,Middle East, Far East and other destinations on the Empire route to the East andis entirely taken up by airgraphs and air letters. The question, therefore, resolvesitself primarily into one of air lift.Additionally, trans-Atlantic air lift will require to be provided to meet theneeds of the Naval Force operating with the Americans in the Pacific which can best be served postally via the United States where the unit locations will be known at an earlier date. Under an agreement between the Admiralty and theUnited States Navy Department, the American Fleet Mail Services will carry the mails from America to the appropriate locations in the Pacific, but no special provision has been made for the trans-Atlantic conveyance. Present trans-Atlantic services provide no margin and will have to be increased proportionatelywith-the volume of additional mail.6. The proposal to transfer to the air mails at present carried by surface transport involves a reduction in air-mail charges and a consequential loss ofrevenue which raises financial issues which are outside the purview of theCommittee. This loss of revenue cannot be avoided if a better service is to beprovided to the Forces.7. Packets and parcels which, will be carried by surface route will benefit from any improvement which may be effected in surface transmission, e.g., byshortened routes and the disappearance of the convoy system over part of the route.8. There is considerable demand for the supply of newspapers both local and national to the Forces overseas. Local newspapers with their morepersonal appeal retain their interest to the recipient in the Field over a much longer period than national newspapers and for them transmission by surfaceroute with delivery within two months may be accepted as reasonable, butnational newspapers which are two months old have little attraction for them, andthe Sub-Committee is of opinion that some alternative to surface mail should befound. In the British Liberation Army national newspapers are conveyed in bulk by air&apos; with the Army mails, and are distributed to units by the Army PostOffice. The application of such a system to the India and S.E.A. Commands andthe Pacific theatre, as suggested by the Service representatives, w^ould involve an air load of at least ^-ton per day, i.e., about 6,000 lbs. a week per 100,000 men, inaddition to the mail loads indicated in paragraph 5, and appears to be out of thequestion. The alternative is the carrage of matrices by air to India, Ceylon and australia for the newspapers to be reproduced there, and although there arepractical difficulties to be overcome the Sub-Committee considers that thepossibility of adopting this alternative should be further explored.[28627]        .&apos; b 2
Rationing of Homeward Air Letters.9. The rationing of homeward air letters has hitherto been necessary tokeep the traffic within the available capacity. The homeward ration was originally one air letter per man per week, but it has been increased as conditionspermitted, first to five, then to six and finally to eight per man per four weeks.In addition to the ration a certain number of free air letters are issued at christmas time. Last Christmas five free air letters were issued to each man anda similar issue is being made this year. There has, however, been a consistentdemand for an unrestricted service, and the Air Ministry have agreed that thepresent position as regards aircraft capacity warrants the removal of the rationing arrangement. It is accordingly proposed to allow -unlimited use of thehomeward air letter service from the Forces in the Mediterranean and Easterntheatres generally to take effect from about the middle of December next when thebulk of the Christmas mails will have been disposed of.10. If the Government takes the view that it is impracticable to expect so large an increase in air lift to be provided at the outset as proposed in para-graph 4, it would be possible to put more letter mail on the air by graduatedstages as more air lift becomes available and the following graduated stageswould be practicable : Total weekly air loadper 100,000 menlbs.(a) All-air conveyance of airgraphs and air letters as atpresent and all-air conveyance of outward Is. 3d.air mail letters, which in default of sufficient air-craft capacity are at present conveyed by sea to egypt and thence by air to destination.    ...      ...      2,100(b) All-air conveyance of air letters at reduced outwardcharge of 3d. and air mail at Qd. per \ oz.        ...      3,900In the homeward direction the ordinary air mail letters from the India andS.E.A. Commands are already in practice conveyed all the way to the UnitedKingdom by air and it may be assumed that the gradual increase in aircraftcapacity will ensure that the present satisfactory quality of service is maintained.It will be seen from paragraph 1 (b) of the annex that a preferentially reduced rate is already in force in India and Ceylon for homeward ordinary air mailletters not exceeding \ oz. in weight. None the less, when stage (b) above isreached in the outward direction, the question will arise of assimilating inwardrates and it is proposed to approach the authorities in India, Ceylon and theDominions concerned with a view to appropriate reductions as required in thisparagraph and paragraph 3 (a).Airgraphs.11. The airgraph service to and from the Forces overseas was introduced at a time when there was not sufficient aircraft capacity for the throughconveyance by !air of any mails except airgraph films which are of negligibleweight. On account of the photographic processes involved it is necessarily slowerby two or three days than the air letter, which has the additional advantage ofbeing a closed communication and, in spite of continued efforts to popularise theairgraph, has ousted it in popularity. It is unlikely that the public here or theForces overseas can be made to increase their use of the service either by publicityor by such small reduction in the 3d. charge as might be possible, althoughextensive preparations have been made by the setting-up of processing stations at Calcutta and Colombo to ensure that the needs of the S.EA.C. will be met.As soon as it is possible to reduce the outward air letter charge to 3d., as visualisedin paragraph 10 (b), the outward traffic may be expected virtually to disappearand the contractors may find that the maintenance of the Calcutta and Colombostations is no longer economically sound.Distribution Arrangements in Far East.12. Reference is made to the need for ensuring the efficiency of thedistributing arrangements in India; and in this connection it should be statedthat the Director of Army Postal Services is in India for direct consultationwith the Indian - authorities. As regards correspondence for personnel of theRoyal Navy and Merchant Navy in India, the primary need appears to be for efficient arrangements for redirection which will be effected by the local
representatives of the Services concerned. So far as air conveyance is necessaryfor the distribution and collection of correspondence within the India and S.E.A.Commands, the Sub-Committee assumes that this will be the responsibility of theSupreme Commander.Extension of Concessions to Theatres other than the Far East.13. This paper has special regard to the position of Forces in the Far Eastbut in the Committee&apos;s view similar conditions apply to the mail requirements of forces in other theatres of war; and while this is true of all Services it hasspecial relevance to the Navy and Merchant Navy : in their case the merits arereinforced by administrative difficulties in limiting a concession to a particular area or areas. The Committee, therefore, recommend that the concessions proposed should apply to all Forces overseas in areas served by air mail. The Air Ministryrepresentatives repeat the reservation made by them under paragraph 4.Recommendations.14.   The Main Committee are asked to : (i) Approve steps being taken to remove the rationing of air letters fromthe Forces overseas.   (Paragraph 9.)(ii) Invite the Air Ministry to provide the additional air lift required tocarry up to 1 oz. letter mail for the Forces overseas by air by the1st March, 1945, or at the end of the war in Europe, whichever isearlier.   (Paragraphs 4, 5 and 13.)(ni) Invite the Priority of Movements Committee to improve the channels of surface conveyance to the Far East. (Paragraph 3 (&amp;).)(iv) Invite the Ministry of Information to pursue the possibility of producingcurrent newspapers in India for Forces in India, S.E.A. command and the Pacific theatre. (Paragraph 8.)(v) Invite the Post Office to report in due course the result of the efforts toreduce the parcel post rates from Forces in India. (Appendix,paragraph 3.)(vi) Invite the War Office to report the result of the discussions of D.A.P.S.with the Indian authorities.   (Paragraph 12.)(vii) Invite the Government Departments concerned (India Office, dominions office, Colonial Office, Air Ministry and Post Office) to concert withthe Indian, Dominion and Colonial authorities for the reduction ofthe air mail rates for the Forces part passu with reductions in the outward rates.

The above homeward rates are, of course, applicable only so long asthe Forces concerned are serving within the jurisdiction of the Indian and ceylon Governments. It is assumed that when United Kingdom Forces in theSouth-East Asia Command are operating outside that jurisdiction they will be served by the British Army Post Office. In that event, British postage stampswould be used and the conditions of postage homewards would then be similarto those applicable to Forces in active theatres generally served by the british army Post Office, i.e., the outward rates of postage would apply except that forair letters the postage in present circumstances would be 3d. instead of Qd. and surface mail letters up to 2 ounces in weight would be free of postage.3. An improvement affecting both the India and South-East Asia Commandsis anticipated shortly in the form of a very substantial reduction in the rates ofpostage charged by the Indian Post Office for homeward parcels. The BritishPost Office has agreed to forgo the major part of the credits which it receivesfrom the Indian Post Office for the sea conveyance of the parcels from Indiaand for delivery in this country. A similar reduction in the correspondingcredits due from the Ceylon Post Office has already been agreed to and has enabledthat office to fix the rates for parcels from Ceylon at the approximate equivalent of the outward rates of postage.
