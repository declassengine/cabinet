Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. JSopy NoW.P. (44) 690.27th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.A COMPARISON OF BRITISH AND AMERICAN transport aircraft.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.IN connection with W.P. (44) 649, I think that my colleagues will be interested to have the substance of a report that has been made comparing sixBritish and six American Transport aircraft which are likely to be availablein numbers for commercial air lines between January 1945 and&quot; January 1947.2. The primary criterion is cost of operation, which is of course mainlya function of pay load and performance, but among the assumptions are anintensity of operation of 3.000 hours a year (higher than has yet been achievedon British air lines though less than current American practice), a load factor of 62 per cent, and a fuel cost of Is. Od. a gallon.3.   The aircraft are : British. . American.York (4 Merlin 24) C54B (4R-2000-3)Lancaster (4 Merlin 24) Constellation (4IV3350-35)Tudor I (4 Merlin 100) &quot;                   DC4A (4R-2000-9)Tudor II (4 Merlin 100) DC4B (4R-2800-C)Tudor II (4 Merlin 100) DC4C (4 Merlin 100)Hermes (4 Hercules) DC6 (4R-2800-C)Avro XXII (6 Merlin 100)4.   The comparison is made on four routes.(i) North Atlantic (London-Prestwick-Gander-Montreal).The Constellation is fastest (16^ hours block to block) but requires a passengerfare of  66 165. Od. The DC4C with Merlin engines takes just under 18 hoursbut the fare is only  44 4s. 0^.The Lancaster, being unpressurised, could not provide a guaranteed service,,would take nearly 21 hours and would require a passenger fare of  137 10s. Od.The Tudor I (at 19-8 hours and  50 2s. 0d.) could, according to the report,compete with other types available by the same date (midsummer 1945) &apos;(butnote these include the Constellation at 16^ hours and  66 16s. Od. and the DC4Bat 17-8 hours and  50 18s. 0d.).(ii) Pacific (Vancouver-Honolulu).The DC4A is the cheapest ( 34) but also the slowest (14-35 hours). TheConstellation is the fastest (9-83 hours) but the fare is  61. The DC4C will besecond both in speed and cost (11-03 hours and  35 14s. Od.) and the Tudor Icomes in the middle of the range (13-35 hours and  41 14s. 0^.) being slightlybeaten in both respects by the DC4B wThich should be available by the same time.(iii) Empire Trunk Routes (e.q.\ London-Cairo,  Cairo-Karachi) and SouthA atlantic.The DC4C is the most economic ( 21 16s. 0d. and 9 - 07 hours) followed closelyby the Tudor I ( 22 16s. 0d. and 10 -12 hours) but both are soundly beaten forspeed by the Constellation (8-06 hours and  30 16s. Od.) and especially theDC4B (6-97 hours and  24 12s. 0d.).[28889]
(iv) Continental Long and Empire Short Stages (e.g., London-Malta, Malta-Cairo, Sydney-Auckland, Karachi-Calcutta).The DC4C is the most economic ( 12 Is. Qd. and 5-69 hours) followed closelyby the DC4B ( 12 11s. Od. and 5-65 hours) and the Lancaster transport  13: and - 75 hours). On these shorter ranges the other types do not seem to be competitiveexcept perhaps for the Constellation which is 36 minutes faster than: the DC4Gfor a fare of  15.5. The general conclusion of the report is the overall excellence of theDC4C with Merlin engines, but if each aircraft can operate over its most economic stage the Hermes is cheapest at 2 - 02d. per revenue passenger mile over960 miles; the Tudor I and DC4C are next at 2-05*1 over 1,670 and 1,775 milesrespectively.6. The report suggests that if American air lines do not use Merlin enginesthe Tudor I should compete successfully on the North Atlantic and could holdits own on the Pacific, Empire and South Atlantic routes, but the figures quoted above are not altogether consonant with this view and it should be regarded with caution.7. The Avro XXII, C54B, DC6 and (for stages over 2,200 miles) the tudor II and Lancaster transport, are not economically efficient. It, appearsthat the best British types for immediate production are : Tudor I for long-stages including North Atlantic.Tudor II up to 1,850 miles.Hermes up to 1,350 miles.E. S. C.Ministry of Aircraft Production,Millbank, S.W. 1,27th November, 1944.
