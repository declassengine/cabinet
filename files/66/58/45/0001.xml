THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOYj&amp;BNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 695.28th November, 1944TEMPORARY   CIVIL   SERVANTS   AND   parliamentary candidature. .Memorandum by the Lord President oe the Council.I find myself unable to agree to the proposal of the Chancellor to apply towar temporary Civil Servants the full rigour of the 1927 Order in Council whichis designed for peace conditions.2. No question arises as to permanent Civil Servants who in return for security of tenure and pension accept a restriction of their political rights, butthe position of war temporaries is entirely different. The great expansion ofthe Civil Service in wartime like that of the armed forces is due to the national emergency. It is illogical to draw a hard line of distinction between those whoserve in uniform and those who do not. Some instances will show the illogicality.There are many persons holding rank as officers whose work is no more militarythan that of a Civil Servant. For instance a surveyor or a barrister employedin the War Office dealing with compensation claims ranks as an officer and maybe a Parliamentary candidate although his work brings him closely in touch withthe public. A person of similar qualification employed by the Ministry of works is barred. A production engineer employed by Vickers is free, but a productionengineer in the service of the Ministry of Supply may not stand. The argument that the relationship of temporary Civil Servants with the public is such thatthey may abuse their position for political advantage applies equally to thosetemporary Civil Servants who might use their positions for their private business interests. Yet the Supply Ministries are largely staffed with persons who, whenthe war ends, will return to private firms with whom they are inevitably in contact officially.3. The Chancellor appears to me to look at the matter wholly from theCivil Service standpoint. He ignores the rights of the citizen, and the damage to the State by depriving it of the possibility of the service in Parliament of well qualified persons. Now that political parties are making selections for thenext general election it is not fair that thousands of citizens, some of whom have been parliamentary candidates in the past, should be penalised for serving the State.4. It is not desirable that these persons should be forced to choose betweenceasing to render service to the nation and relinquishing their politicalaspirations.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,28th November, 1944.I?JWAR CABINET.[28703]
