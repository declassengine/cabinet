Printed for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET- ACUopy No. II)W.P. (44) 699.5 A December, 1944.WAR uABiNBT.CIVIL AIR TRANSPORT.Note by the Prime Minister.IT may be convenient to my colleagues to have the telegram from the Presidentof the 21st November, 1944 (No. 654), which was considered* by the War Cabineton the 22nd November, together with the reply which I sent as a result of our discussion   Both telegrams were repeated to Lord Swinton. tThis completes the series of telegrams begun in W.P. (44) 693 and continued in W.P. (44) 698.Telegram from President Roosevelt to Prime Minister No. 654 dated21st November.The Aviation Conference is at an impasse because of a square issue between our people and yours. We have met you on a number of points, notably anarrangement for regulation of rates and an arrangement by which the numberof planes in the air shall be adjusted to the amount of traffic. This is as far asI can go. In addition, your people are now asking limitations on the number ofplanes between points regardless of traffic offering.   This seems to me a form of w. s. c,10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,5th December, 1944.(Top Secret.)I.* W.M.

strangulation. It has been a cardinal point in American policy throughout thatthe ultimate judge should be the passenger and the shipper. The limitations nowproposed would, I fear, place a dead hand on the use of the great air trade routes.You don&apos;t want that any more than I do.The issue will be debated to-morrow. I hope you can get into this yourselfand give instructions, preferably by telephone, to your people in Chicago so thatwe can arrange, if possible, to agree. It would be unfortunate indeed if theConference broke down on this issue.II.Prime Ministers Reply to President dated, 22nd November.We have sat all day on your message No. 654 which only reached me at-15 a.m. this morning.The Cabinet after prolonged discussion desire me to send to you the following-expression of their views which I endorse. If there is anything in this message on which you would like further explanation I earnestly request that you should send for Lord Swinton.Message from Cabinet begins : -1. We would wish to draw your attention to the course of the negotiations at Chicago which have been marked by a large measure of concessions on bothsides.   .2. Whereas in order to reach a common agreement your delegation has agreed to a method of regulating the share of the various countries on thedifferent routes and of regulating the fares, we have agreed to the throwing openof our airfields all over the world to aircraft of other nationalities and to suchplanes-being able to carry not only through traffic but local traffic between twoneighbouring countries on the route.3. We had very much hoped that the agreement thus arrived at betweenyour delegation and ours which was embodied in the form of the draft of17th November would be a satisfactory document to submit for the approval of&quot;the whole body of the conference.4. We feel that we have gone to the limit of concession in this draftespecially with relation to the so-called escalator clause which enabled the shareof operators to be increased if they in fact carry more traffic between terminalsthan they are allotted under the frequency arrangements.5. In our understanding it was only because of the new proposals brought forward by your delegation on the evening of 18th November after the agreement had been arrived at, that the present difficulties have arisen. These proposals we could not accept since they demand a share of the local traffic between twoneighbouring countries by the aircraft of a third country far beyond that whichthe granting of the right to take up traffic on through service would warrant.
6. We were prepared to agree to the so-called Fifth Freedom subject to adequate protection of the local operators by a price differential to which yourdelegates agreed in the draft accepted.7. We are, of course, prepared to stand by what Swinton had already agreed with Berle, but we cannot see our way to accept these new suggestions putforward, which would gravely jeopardise our own position.8. We suggest therefore that if you are unable to confirm the agreementarrived at on the 17th November by our delegations at Chicago, the conference should finalise the valuable technical agreements which have been arrived at andthat the rest of the matters should be adjourned for a time during which we canconsider the matter more fully and see whether there is some solution of theproblem at which we can arrive.9. We share with you the most earnest desire to come to a fair and satis-factory agreement by which both our countries can play their full part in thedevelopment of world wide civil aviation as soon as possible.10. We hope that you will be able to examine this and we feel sure you will agree that it is a wise and workable compromise between two points of view whichoriginally diverged widely.Message from Cabinet ends.
