THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.iSECRET. x4opy No.W.P. (44) 697.28th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 1944 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.THE Canadian Government took simultaneous action with the AlliedPowers in according full recognition to the Provisional Government of France.By a happy coincidence, the Canadian authorities had already agreed to theFree French Delegation occupying the premises of the former Vichy Legation,and the Tricolour was hoisted on the premises on the very day of recognition.2. With the possibility of a General Election before many months, themain item of domestic interest has been the realignment of political parties and their likely prospects. The pace of political controversy has been set by colonel Drew, the Progressive Conservative Premier of Ontario. Colonel Drew-succeeded to the Premiership in 1943, and in his early days won considerableapproval for what was felt to be a fair, efficient, and honest administration, butrecently his public utterances have become more and more extreme. In spiteof general support for the family allowances scheme on the part of the FederalProgressive Party, the Ontario Premier attacked this measure, and has recently made increasingly hostile references to the &quot;prolific population&quot; of Quebec.The Labour Progressive (i.e., Communist) Party in Ontario have been campaign-ing actively against the Conservative administration, although they have noopen alliance with the other parties. The Liberal Party, which has hithertosupported Colonel Drew, has now announced that they will not do so in the next session. Unless, therefore, the C.C.F. support the Conservative administration,the days of Colonel Drew&apos;s administration seem to be numbered.3. Apart from this, the most outstanding event in Ontario politics hasbeen, the return of Mr. M. Hepburn to provincial politics. It may be assumed that his election as leader of the Provincial Liberal Party will follow in due course.4. The Minister of Labour, Mr. Humphrey Mitchell, announced thatwhen the war ends National Selective Service is not to be abandoned; but willtransform itself into a nation-wide employment service with offices in everylocality.5. It is expected that Canada&apos;s export trade for 1944 will be considerably in excess of $3,000 million, far outstripping any previous year in the historyof Canadian commerce.6. Mention has already been made of charges made by a Major Smythe,a returned Canadian officer, that the reinforcements for the Canadian Armynow being sent to Europe are inadequately trained and equipped. Agitationover this matter continued during October, with demands that there should be aGovernment investigation of the charges.[28715] t b
7. Three new Canadian departments have been established. Mr. Howe,who will also retain his present post as Minister of Munitions and Supply, hasbeen appointed Minister of Reconstruction. Mr. Ian Mackenzie has beenappointed Minister of Veterans Affairs, his old Department of Pensions and national Health having been closed. Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s Parliamentaryassistant, Mr. Brooke Claxton, has been promoted to Cabinet rank, and willhead the new Department of National Health.8. Dr. Pero Cabric, Consul-General in Montreal for Yugoslavia since 1942,has been appointed Charge d&apos;Affaires at the Yugoslavia Legation in Ottawa,and Dr. Henri Laureys-has presented his credentials as Canadian ambassador to Peru.Service Activities.9. H.M.C. Frigate Cheboque, while escorting a convoy to North America onthe 4th, was torpedoed 500 miles S.W. of Cape Clear. On the 14th H.M.C.Frigate Magog was torpedoed in the mouth of the St. Lawrence while on anti-submarine patrol and had her stern blown off. On the 17th H.M.C. FrigatesAnnan and Lock Achanalt sank a U-boat between the Shetlands and the Faeroesand took prisoner 44 of the crew.   H.M.S.

Destroyer Skeena went ashore in a gale off Iceland and had to be temporarily abandoned; she was again damaged in heavy weather some days later. Between the 26th and 28th H.M.C. Destroyers Algonquin and Siouxsupported- H.M.S. Implacable in air operations against shipping off theNorwegian coast.10. During October the First Canadian Army was engaged in threedistinct operations on various sectors of the front of 21st Army Group : -(a) An attack northwards across the Antwerp-Turnhout Canal by the2nd Canadian Infantry Division and 4th Canadian armoured division in conjunction with the 49th United Kingdom Division and polish Armoured Division. These formations were later joined bya United States Division.(b) A drive westwards into Walcheren Island along the Beveland isthmusstarted as soon as the eastern end of the isthmus had been freed bythe northward advance from the Antwerp-Turnhout Canal. this operation against Walcheren was assisted by landings carried out byScottish troops and Royal Marines on the south and west coasts ofthe island.(c) The crossing of the Leopold Canal and the elimination of the german troops cut off south of the Scheldt in the Breskens area. this operation was carried out in the main by the Third Canadian division and consisted of a northward drive across the Leopold Canal assisted by a flanking movement carried out by troops ferried across theSavojaards Plaat.11. All these three operations, having as their object the opening of the scheldt Estuary to our shipping, were naturally strongly opposed by the germans and necessitated heavy and prolonged fighting. Our northward advance fromAntwerp, though continuous, was slow and difficult; the water-logged natureof the ground, added to the desperate resistance of the Germans, made conditionsvery difficult for our troops and precluded any rapid advance. Groundconditions in the Beveland isthmus were, if anything, worse. South of the scheldt the marshy nature of the country prevented our using armoured units.12. Nevertheless, by the end of the month the First Canadian Army hadaccomplished the following results : On the right they had captured Bergen-op-Zoom and were on the outskirts of Breda and Roosendaal; in South Bevelandthey were almost on the western end of the causeway leading to Walcheren;while on the left they had reduced the German pocket south of the Scheldt to theimmediate vicinity of Knocke, where street fighting was in progress.13. In Italy the 1st Canadian Corps was located in the Adriatic sector ofthe Eighth Arniy front, its main formations consisting of the 2nd New Zealand division and the 5th Canadian Armoured Division, strengthened later by theaddition of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, which took over from the NewZealand Division on the extreme right on the 10th of the month.   On the 14th
sthe Canadians were successful in establishing bridgeheads over the Rubiconeand on the 19th made a firm bridgehead across the Pisciatello. On the 22nd theycaptured Cervia on the Adriatic coast. From then onwards until the end of themonth heavy rain slowed up operations.14. Heavy bombers of No. 6 (R.C.A.F.) Group flew 2,545 sorties during october; 16 aircraft were lost. Targets were mainly cities in Western Germany;sea-mining and air-sea rescue operations were also carried out. Squadrons ofthis group claim one enemy aircraft destroyed, one probably destroyed and onedamaged.15. No. 405 (R.C.A.F.) Pathfinder Squadron of No. 8 Group flew 743 hourswithout loss.16. Beaufighters, Sunderlands and Wellingtons of R.C.A.F. coastal command flew 2,813 operational hours. All aircraft returned safely. two merchant vessels, two escort vessels and one tanker were claimed as destroyed inaddition to other vessels damaged.17. R.C.A.F. Squadrons in the 2nd Tactical Air Force flew 6,306 sorties,totalling 7,529 hours; 16 aircraft are missing from these operations. During themonth 22 enemy aircraft were claimed destroyed.18. No. 441 Spitfire Squadron and Nos. 406 and 418 Mosquito NightIntruder Squadrons of Fighter Command flew 555 operational hours and lostsix aircraft. No. 418 Squadron claimed 18 enemy aircraft destroyed and16 damaged.19. During October No. 437 R.C.A.F. Squadron of Transport Commandflew 1,436 operational hours carrying supplies to the Armed Forces in belgium and Holland.   One aircraft is missing from these operations.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.20. In a statement on the war against Japan, the Prime Minister said thata complete recasting of the Australian war effort, designed to fit out Australiaas an organic base, just as Britain was fitted out for the war in Europe, had beenunder consideration. After reviewing the great part which the Australian armed forces had played from the middle of 1942 until the end of 1943, when the great bulk of the land fighting had fallen upon the Australian Army, Mr. Curtin saidthat, with the expansion of the American effort in the Pacific, Australia had beenable to divert some man-power to the production of food. In addition to the feeding of Australian civilians and Services, Australia was supplying food tothe Allied forces based on Australia, to Britain and to British forces overseas.21. The Minister of Aircraft Production (Senator Cameron) has announced the intention of the Australian authorities to concentrate upon the manufactureof important types of aircraft and engines, such as the Lancaster, Beaufighter andMosquito; and Merlin engines. The manufacture of locally designed bomber aircraft will be suspended for the present.22. Plans are now being made to bring into operation in January theCommonwealth Government^ scheme of Unemployment and Sickness Benefit.The scheme will be administered mainly by the States, with the help of Common-wealth officers.23. Upon the adjournment of the Conference of Representatives of Non-Labour Organisations at Canberra, the Opposition Leader, Mr. R. G. Menzies,said that the Conference had made notable progress towards unity, with theformation of a new party to be known as the Australia Liberal Party, a nameused by the anti-Labour groups until 1916. The governing body would be theFederal Council, equally representing all States, with a permanent Secretariatat Canberra. Although sections of the press criticised its policy as lacking in anyobvious incentive to progress, comment, on the whole, has been encouraging.24. A Conference of Commonwealth and States Premiers held at Canberrahas reached agreement on a plan for soldier settlement, of which the main points were that land settlement should only be undertaken by those most suitable andcompetent, on land which has economic prospects. . The Commonwealth Govern-ment would bear the cost of educational training and of allowances to settlers[28715] .. b 2
during the assistance period of one year. Some 6,000 applications from Servicemen for facilities to settle on the land have so far been received in New SouthWales alone, and about 50,000 men are expected to seek settlement on the land, atan estimated outlay of A 16 million. The States Governments would in generaladminister the settlement schemes. The Conference also discussed motions forthe future of Commonwealth-State co-operation in regional planning, and thepress has taken the opportunity of urging the closest co-operation to offset thedifficulties caused by the defeat of the referendum.25. One. of the worst droughts which Australia has ever experienced,especially in the fertile, districts of Victoria, and in the Riverina district ofNew South Wales, and which will mean a total loss of some crops, has been onlypartly broken by light rains.26. The temporary appointment of Sir Frederick Eggleston, AustralianMinister to China, as Australian Minister to the United States in succession toSir Owen Dixon, has been announced. Australian Consulates are to be established in New York and San Francisco, and press attaches will be appointed to washington, Chungking, Ottawa and New Delhi. Each press attache will actas a Public Relations Officer under the general control of the heads of theAustralian missions abroad.Service Activities.27. Between the 13th and the 18th His Majesty&apos;s Australian CruisersShropshire and Australia took part in operations with the United States7th Fleet which covered the landings in the Central Philippines; on the 21st,A australia was hit on the bridge by a bomb in Leyte Gulf; the Captain, four other officers and seventeen ratings were killed. On the 25th, H.M.A.S. Shropshireand His Majesty&apos;s Australian destroyer Arunta took part in a fleet action in theSurigao Strait, south of Leyte. Arunta made a torpedo attack and engagedwith guns-.&apos; Shropshire fired thirty-two 8-in. broadsides at Japanese heavy ships at ranges from 14,000 to 16,000 yards.28. On the 18th, His Majesty&apos;s Australian Minesweeper Geelong was sunkin collision off Finschafen, New Guinea; there were no casualties. His Majesty&apos;sAustralian Destroyer Quiberon, forming part of the escort to the Eastern Fleet,took part in air operations against the Nicobar Islands.29. Total strength of United States forces (Army and Air Corps) in South-West Pacific Area on the 8th October was 688,759, including 132,603 of theAir Corps.-   NEW ZEALAND.30.   The campaign for the Victory loan closed on the 4th October, with ,contributions just over the target figure of   N.Z. 40 million, and while the finalresult is not yet known, the result so far is regarded as satisfactory.Service A activities.31. At the beginning of the month the Second New Zealand Divisionformed part of the First Canadian Corps in the Adriatic coastal sector of the eighth Army front where it remained until the 10th of the month when itwas relieved by the First Canadian Infantry Division, thus being free to exploitany opportunity of a forward advance. On the evening of the 14th, two companies of a New Zealand battalion entered San Angelo and later, followingup a German withdrawal, they captured Gambitolla on the 15th and Ruffio onthe 17th. On the 20th, New Zealand troops reached the lower reaches of theRiver Savio and effected a crossing but before they could be reinforced heavyrain fell flooding the river; for some time the troops occupying the bridgeheadwere in a precarious situation owing to the difficulty in keeping them supplied;no bridges could be built before the 23rd. This bad weather persisted untilthe end of the month preventing any appreciable further advance.32.   In view of the surplus of trained aircrew reserve in the UnitedKingdom, the New Zealand Government has stopped sending any further draftsfor training in Canada under the Empire Air Training Scheme.   Personnel&apos; already in Canada will either complete their training and be drafted to theUnited Kingdom or will be posted back to New Zealand for duty there.
33. Four Sunderland aircraft have been allocated for the purpose of inter-communication between New Zealand and the Pacific Islands.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.34. Speaking at the Transvaal Congress of the United Party atJohannesburg, Field-Marshal Smuts gave a review of the record of the Party andthe Government during the war years, and of the contributions by South africa to the war effort of the United Nations. The Prime Minister belittled theimportance of the Nationalist Opposition, and ridiculed their chances of oustingthe United Party from office, even after his own disappearance from its leadership.Of the war, the Prime Minister said that the end of the European war willprobably reduce South Africa&apos;s munition programme by half, while it will increase her activities at the ports for transport to the Far East, and added thatit may be assumed that South Africa&apos;s share in the war against Japan willbe limited chiefly to technical and engineering services and to the air.35. Demands for an enquiry into the activities of the &apos;&apos; Broederbond &apos;&apos; havebeen made by a number of pro-Government papers, following an allegation by theMinister of Welfare and Demobilisation that this secret organisation had incitedopposition to the Social Welfare Congress on a colour issue. The &quot; Broederbond &quot;has been described as a secret Afrikaner group which aims at placing key menin important positions throughout the country, and in the Civil Service, andwhich acts as a link between various political, religious and cultural organisations of a highly Nationalist and Republican flavour.36. National Social Welfare Conferences now meeting at Johannesburghave pleaded the necessity for a national organisation, with trained workers, tohelp to solve the problems of social security, health, housing and demobilisation.37. The recent serious mine wages dispute was settled by the Mine Workers&apos;Union agreeing to waive their demand for a 30 per cent, increase in wages, andto accept the Chamber of Mines&apos; offer of  100,000 a year for five years to be spent on housing schemes and other amenities for workers.38. The difficulties, which have already been reported, over the Indianhousing question in Natal, flared up again to somewhat dangerous heights. TheNatal Indian Congress adopted a resolution rejecting a draft Ordinance whichthe Natal Government propose to introduce, and unsuccessfully requested an interview with the Prime Minister before the second reading of the draft, since they regard the Ordinance as going beyond the former Pretoria Agreement. TheNatal Indians claim that the Ordinance imposes restrictions on the acquisitionof residential property, and not on residential occupation only; also that theproposed Natal Housing Board is objectionable in principle to Indians.39. Food riots in Durban, and inadequate supply arrangements in the other centres, have led to angry protests even in the columns of pro-Government papers.The Opposition press blames the Government for sending too much food out ofthe country for war purposes. To meet criticism, the Prime Minister has nowrarranged for truck loads of cattle, potatoes, &amp;c., to be diverted there from otherparts of the Union, Rhodesia and South-West Africa.40. The death of Colonel Reitz, Union High Commissioner in London since1942, was the occasion of moving tributes by the Prime Minister and by practically all sections of opinion in the Union.Service A activities.41. The South African Government have accepted as a gift three royal naval Frigates with stores; crews will be sent to the United Kingdom to takeover these ships.  The names of the ships have not yet been announced.42. During October the South African Armoured Division remained withthe Fifth United States Army on the left flank of the Bologna sector about midwaybetween Bologna and Pistoia. Some slight advances were made during the first part of the month, but later on, owing to substantial German reinforcement of this-sector and generally unfavourable weather, our positions became more or lessstabilised.
EIRE.43. Mr. de Valera said, in reply to a question in the Dail whether he wouldtake steps to make a final approach to the British Government on the question of partition and whether, in the event of the British Government failing to givesatisfaction, a case could be made and placed before the coming European PeaceConference, that the need and urgency of restoring the unity of Ireland is ever before the Government, and that no&quot; opportunity for bringing home to those concerned the injustice of the present position and its bearing on the relationsbetween Ireland and Britain has been or will be neglected.44. At the recent Annual Assembly of the Fianna Fail, a resolution wasadopted renewing allegiance to the Proclamation of the Republic of 1916, anddemanding that the abolition of partition should be the first plank in the Govern-menfs post-war policy.45. Asked in the Dail whether representations had been made by the AlliedGovernments to the Government of Eire concerning the harbouring of &quot;war criminals &apos;/ after the war, Mr. de Valera said that he hoped to be in a position ina week or two to give the information sought. To a similar question asked a fortnight later, the reply was that the question must be postponed still further.46. Speaking at Ennis, Mr. de Valera outlined elaborate plans for thedefence of Eire after the war, which he said had been made by the Governmentand would be brought before the Dail. Its principal feature comprised a standingarmy of as many men under 30 as the country could afford and a permanentterritorial force on the lines of the existing local Defence Force.47. Replying for Mr. de Valera in the Dail to a question whether adequateplans were being made to provide returning emigrants with work and homes, theMinister for Finance said that it was not proposed to make separate provisionfor those who have emigrated during the emergency and who may return later assuch but special attention is being given to the planning of works with a highemployment content for the larger urban areas, and for those rural areas whichexperience has shown to be most likely to need works of this kind, and it is fromthese areas that a high proportion of those who have emigrated in recent years have gone.48. A measure of the volume of emigration from Eire in recent years is pro-vided in the figures of travel permits issued to persons going to employment out-side Eire.   They were : 1941 35,132; 1942 51,711; and 1943 48,324.49. Totalling  12,589,000, emigrants&apos; remittances to Eire during 1943 setup a record, being  4,210,000 more than the total for 1942. Of this amount, 10,950,000 went from the United Kingdom, an increase of  4,150,000 on thecorresponding figure for 1942. In 1939, emigrants remitted a total of  2,826,000,of which  600,000 went from the United Kingdom.50. Replying in the Dail to a question whether he would state what action by way of Ministerial contact or otherwise the Government were taking to securetrade arrangements with Great Britain of live-stock and live-stock products inthe different categories best suited to their circumstances, and to obtain informa-tion as to the possibilities of trade in basic stock for the restocking of Europe, theMinister for Agriculture replied that he was not satisfied that in presentcircumstances any useful purpose would be served by initiating negotiations orenquiries in respect of export trade in agricultural products in the post-war period.51. Both imports and exports for August showed increases compared withthe corresponding month in 1943: imports totalled  2,115,875 as against 1,691,795, and exports  2,071,819 as against  1,705,112.52. In September,-the total trade is returned at  4,712,152, or  98,401 morethan in September 1943. Imports are valued at  2,012,368 and exports at 2,699,784.SOUTHERN RHODESIA.53. As a result of correspondence with the Southern Rhodesia Governmentwhich followed the discussions with Sir Godfrey Huggins during his visit to thiscountry earlier in the year, it was announced that it is proposed to establish a
standing Central African Council of a consultative character for the purpose of promoting close contact and co-operation between the Governments of SouthernRhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. It was indicated in the statement that His Majesty&apos;s Government realise that the Southern Rhodesia government still adhere to their view that the three territories should be amalgamated, butthat His Majesty&apos;s Government had come to the conclusion, after carefulconsideration, that such amalgamation could not under existing circumstances beregarded as practicable.54. Preliminary press reports on the reception of the statement in SouthernRhodesia indicate that, as was to be expected, there is disappointment in some quarters with the decision that amalgamation could not be accepted, but theestablishment of the standing Council is welcomed as representing a definiteadvance.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.55. There has been so far no important sequel to the breakdown of the september conversations between Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah. Each leaderindulged in a certain degree of recrimination of the other. Outside the congress party the general feeling, to which the Hindu Mahasabha and the Sikhs gaveparticular expression, was one of relief at the failure of the talks, while moslem league meetings supported Mr. Jinnah1 s stand for Pakistan. There hasfortunately been no accentuation of inter-communal bitterness. As the monthpassed, signs of a more realistic approach became apparent; there were variouspress appeals for British intervention in some form or other, and the HindustanTimes, the Congress Party&apos;s newspaper, urged the convocation of an all-partiesconference to discuss the formation of a Committee to draft a constitution forIndia. The paper thought that if the Viceroy should call such a conference no party would refuse to attend, provided steps were taken to proclaim a politicaltruce; even if full co-operation were withheld the conference might at any rateprove a tonic for removing the present feeling of depression.56. The vexed question of the treatment of Indians in South Africa has again come to the fore. The introduction in the Natal Legislature of anOrdinance supposed to give effect to the Pretoria Agreement of last April (theobject of which was the withdrawal of the hated &apos;&apos; Pegging &apos;&apos; Act) but containingprovisions in certain Tespects less favourable to Indians, has caused a freshoutburst of agitation in India.Foreign and Frontier Relations.57. Afghanistan. It was reported on reliable authority that the AfghanGovernment convened a secret meeting of the National Assembly to considerbreaking off relations with Germany and Japan. No definite conclusion was,however, reached. The hostile leader, Mazrak, has not yet come to any settlement with the Afghan Government or shown any further sign of an inclination tosettle down in India. He was reported to be intriguing against the AfghanGovernment with a religious mendicant who claims to be a brother of KingAmanullah; the latter, however, has no following..58. The Government of India have arranged to take 15 Afghanofficers for training courses in topography and survey work. It is intended thatthese officers on their return should form the nucleus of an Afghan SurveyDepartment.59. The economic situation remains normal. The Russian anti-locust and anti-pest Commission in Kabul has received considerable publicity.60. North West Frontier. There was nothing to report during the month from the frontier, which remained quiet. In Peshawar three British R.A.F.officers were attacked near the R.A.F. mess bv unknown assailants and were all killed.61. Tibet. Sir Basil Gould had several discussions in Lhasa with Mr. Shen,the Chinese Delegate, on the Tibetan question.  Mr. Shen had apparently received
instructions to explore the possibilities of a settlement of the Tibetan question on practical rather than on theoretical grounds, but he showed no disposition to compromise on the subject of Tibefs status vis-a-vis China. He claimed thatTibet was a part of China and that the suggestion of autonomy for Tibet inthe sphere of external relations would shock Chinese political opinion and wasunthinkable. The question, he said, was mainly a matter of prestige. he described as ridiculous the idea that after the war China might invade Tibet,though he twice hinted in conversation that there was a party in China whofavoured direct action and were only kept in check by the Generalissimo. SirBasil Gould&apos;s&apos; relations with Mr. Shen were friendly enough, but he reported thatin regard to major issues Mr. Shen showed no indication of any genuine desire for compromise or co-operation. Mr. Shen appeared to envisage further negotia-tions with the Tibetans after his own report on the position had been considered in Chungking. Sir Basil Gould has made clear both to Mr. Sheii and to theTibetans the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the subject, and it is intended that he should leave Lhasa early in November.62. Sinkiang. Early in the month there were rumours of fighting betweenthe Russians and the Chinese in the vicinity of Tashkurghan. It was thought,however, that this incident was not more than a tip-and-run raid by RussianKirghiz for purposes of plunder, and official relations between the Chinese andthe Soviet Consul-General were reported to have become easier during the month.Economic arid Social.63. Transportation. Of India&apos;s additional requirements of 318 broad-gauge locomotives and 24,000 broad-gauge wagons, 100 locomotives and,000 wagons have been placed in Canada for production during 1945. Theproblem of securing fulfilment of the outstanding balances of 218 locomotives and 16,000 wagons has been clarified to the extent that it has now been arranged to produce in the United Kingdom in 1945 (a) 110 XD&apos;s plus 35 XE&apos;s (equal in tractive power to 48 XD&apos;s) whichlessens the outstanding balance by 158 locomotives;.   (6) 10,000 wagons.As regards the residue of 60 locomotives and 6,000 wagons, the United StatesWar Department has finally refused to accept any part on the A.S.P. Thealternative of procurement from America through F.E.A. is now underconsideration.64. Export to India of Civilian Goods. The importance of securing theexport to India of increased quantities of goods for civilian use, and materials and stores entering into the production of such goods, has recently been emphasised, owing to the need to afford immediate relief to India&apos;s serious economic position, to remedy physical shortages and to enable her to bear the strain of serving as a base for operations against Japan. To this end, improvedinterdepartmental machinery in the United Kingdom is in process of being putinto operation.65. The Bhore Committee. In October 1943, the Government of Indiaappointed a Health Survey and Development Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Joseph Bhore, to make a broad survey of the present position in regardto health conditions and organisation in British India, and to make recom-mendations for future development. There are twenty-three members (including three women) all of whom have practical experience of various aspects of the health problem in India. The Committee have recently asked that a number of experts selected by them should be invited to go to India to give evidence on certain aspects of public health of which they have special knowledge. ProfessorRyle, Dr. Janet Vaughan and Sir Weldon Dalrymple-Champneys are goingfrom this country, in addition to one expert from Australia, two from the UnitedStates, and possibly one from the U.S.S.R.India and the War.Royal Indian Navy.66. HM.I.S. Ahmedabad, Basset class trawler, commissioned on the4th September.
67. A R.I.N. base establishment has now been set up in Colombo the nameof which is H.M.I.S. Sambhar.68. R.I.N. ships have been actively engaged in Convoy Escort and Anti-Submarine activities during the month of October.Military.69. Italy. The 4th, 8th and 10th Indian divisions and other Indianformations have been engaged throughout the month on both Fifth and eighth army fronts.70. Burma. In the Chin Hills the 5th Indian Division captured Tiddimafter a surprise attack in which tanks, aided by low visibility, climbed theChocolate Staircase. Later they advanced against little opposition 11 milestowards Kalewa, which brought them close to enemy positions of great naturalstrength in the neighbourhood of Kennedy Peak (subsequently taken). To theSouth the tribal areas in the Central and Southern Chin Hills were occupied with the assistance of tribal levies and the enemy were forced to evacuate Falamand Haka.71. In Northern Burma the 36th British Division continued its drive down the railway to Mawhun (85 miles S.W. of Myitkyina). Chinese Forces carriedout active patrolling South of Kaza (24 miles S.S.E. of Myitkyina).72. Early in the month in Arakan the Japanese sent a strong reconnaissanceparty to attempt to close the Goppe Pass, which links the Mayu Valley with themain road leading into Arakan from India. This party was driven back with theloss in killed of more than 25 per cent, of their effectives and was withdrawn. &apos;73. The 81st West African Division reoccupied its pre-monsoon positions on both sides of the river in the Kaladan Valley and began moving towards Paletwa.Aii&apos;.74. In the early part of the month bad weather greatly hampered air operations. Nevertheless, repeated attacks were made on Japanese troop concen-trations near the Chinese border on the Burma-China road, and strong supportwas given to our ground troops in Arakan and the Chin Hills. A most successfullow-level strike was made on several miles of the railway North of Bangkok. Itwas anticipated that this should interfere for some time with supplies to NorthBurma and the Salween front. With an improvement in the weather tactical andstrategical air activity increased and was vigorously maintained. The railway from Rangoon to Mandalay and Lashio was heavily attacked, and railway and road bridges and supply dumps throughout Northern and Central Burma were severely damaged. Successful drives against airfields were also carried out.Enemy shipping off Moulmein was attacked and mines were laid.General.75. Morale and factors affecting it were generally unchanged. strong criticism of our publicity compared with that of the Americans was still reported.Very considerable resentment was expressed in military circles against the opinions of Mr. Phillips as reported in the American press.76. First reactions to the recent White Papers were that the pay increase was more generous than expected, the repatriation scheme was a great improve-ment but not yet good enough, and the reallocation scheme was generally fair.77.
