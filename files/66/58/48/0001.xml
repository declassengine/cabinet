THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 698.5th December, 1944.WAR CABINET.CIVIL AIR TRANSPORT.Note by the Prime Minister.FOLLOWING our discussion* on Monday last, I have sent to president roosevelt the following reply to his telegram quoted in my W.P. (44) 693 : Prime Minister to Presihent Roosevelt. No. 836.Personal and Top Secret. 28.11.44.1. Winant has brought me your message about the Air in reply to myNo. 827, and naturally it has caused me much anxiety. I agree with you thatthis is a grave matter in which not only Governments but Parliaments and peoplesmay become deeply agitated, with consequences which cannot fail to be disastrousboth to the prosecution of the war and to the prevention of future wars. I feel it my duty therefore to place before you in simple terms the issue as it presentsitself to me after hearing all the advice of the special Committee underBeaverbrook, of which Stafford Cripps is an important member, as well as the unanimous views of the War Cabinet.2. The foundations of our position at this Conference, which is being heldat the time and place which you proposed, are : (a) The British Empire is asked to put invaluable and irreplaceable bases for Air transport all over the world at the disposal of such nations as are capable of using them. This means of course primarily and in bulk placing them at the disposal of the United States.(b) It was agreed between us as a war measure that you should makethe transport aircraft and specialise upon them on account of thecharacter of the war, the need to supply China over the Hump, thevast distances of the Pacific Ocean, &amp;c, and that we should concentrate our efforts upon fighting types. In consequence the UnitedStates are in an incomparably better position than we are to fill anyneeds of Air transport that may arise after the war is over, and tobuild up their civil aircraft industry.[28723]* W.M. (44) 156th Conclusions.
We would venture most earnestly to suggest that these two points are notreceiving adequate consideration.3. However in partial recognition of the above two points, Lord Swintonbelieved that he had reached an agreement with Mr. Berle at Chicago onNovember 17 about the amount of aircraft capacity that should be put into service by our respective countries (frequencies) on a basis of &quot; embarked traffic.&quot;Agreement was also reached about fares to prevent undercutting, unfairsubventions, &amp;c.4. All the above was satisfactory to us and, I think, to the world. OnNovember 18, however, your side of the table put forward an entirely new set of ideas and arguments which, in our judgment, took away Avith one hand what had been given with the other in consideration of our fundamental positionset forth above in paragraphs 2 (a) and (b).5. For instance, the Escalator Clause was sought, not only for traffic toand from your country but also for traffic between any two foreign countries.This meant that the number of services on any route could be increased when an airline achieved a load equal to 65 per cent, of its full capacity. We hadalready agreed, reluctantly, that this Escalator Clause should apply to traffic;to and from an aircraft&apos;s own country. We had also agreed to a so-called FifthFreedom which would grant to an aircraft on through services the right topick up and set down traffic between foreign countries at intermediate stops.It is true that provision was made for a differentiation of fares to safeguard the local traffic.   That seemed to me a valuable line to explore.6. Mr. Berle then asked for a combination of the Escalator Clause and the fifth Freedom which would enable American aircraft to carry most of the traffic between the United Kingdom and the Dominions and India and all foreigncountries, as well as between all nations of the Commonwealth. It would, in fact,give to United States airlines the right to everything save cabotage.7. We must accept the fact that the arrangements about frequencies willvery soon be completely different from those agreed upon before the EscalatorClause was proposed. There is very little doubt that our position relatively toyours is markedly injured thereby. This applies not only to Great Britain butto many other durable Powers who are now in a weak condition to design and build suitable transport aircraft and to embark traffic.8. On top of this Escalator Clause, which we have conceded for traffic toand from your country, Mr. Berle now demands the right of duplication over any section of any through route, and also provision for increasing frequencies so thatany airline could carry all the intermediate traffic it could get. This might wellmean that aircraft embarking traffic in the United States would not only excel, asthey are welcome to clo on merits, but dominate and virtually monopolise trafficnot only between  our country and yours, but between all other foreign countries and British Dominions besides.9. I have the opinion that both-this point of linking the Escalator clause and the Fifth Freedom together, and the claim for duplication on foreign air routes, require further patient study with a view to reaching agreement between our two countries.   Thus we could make sure that Great Britain and the
Dominions and many other countries as well are not in fact run out of the Airaltogether as a result of your flying start with no regard to the fact that we are willing to throw all our bases all over the world into the common pool. I am sureI could not obtain the agreement of the Cabinet or of either House of Parliamentto anything which wore that aspect.   Nor would I try.10. It may be that you will say I have not rightly posed the issues. Ifthis be so, I should be most grateful if you would state them in your own words.Is it suggested, for instance, that we are going to challenge the right of all nations of innocent passage in Freedom I, or the consequential right of refuellingand repair in Freedom II, except in so far as these are mixed up in the muchmore refined issues arising out of your doctrines of Escalator and duplication ?There may well be other simplifications which could be made.11. Should it not be possible for us to reach an agreement at this stage onFreedoms 3, 4 and 5, when great battles in which our troops are fighting side by side are at their height and when we are preparing for immense new further efforts against Japan. I cannot see that a temporary adjournment to allow ofthe aforesaid patient discussions would do any serious harm. On the contrary,I believe that it would be as readily understood as was the postponement of finaldecision at Dumbarton Oaks. There is always the great body of technical matterupon which agreement has been secured. Therefore unless complete agreement isreached, I plead that there shall be an adjournment. Such adjournment for ashort time, if asked for by an intimately-Allied Power like us, ought not to be denied, nor ought we to be confronted with such very serious contingencies as are set out in your message received on Saturday. As open dispute carried on byParliament and Congress, both of which would have to be informed and in ourvoluble Free Press on both sides, would do far more harm to the war effort and.to our hopes of the future than an adjournment of a few weeks qr even months.while both parties persevered behind the scenes.for a settlement.12. It is my earnest hope that you will not bring into this Air discussion the prospect of our suffering less generous treatment on Lend-Lease than we had expected from the Quebec discussions. But even if I thought that we were to beso penalized, I would not feel myself able to agree to a decision contrary to the merits, as we see them, on this matter.13. I should be ready, of course, to accept impartial arbitration on thepoints outstanding at the Chicago Conference, provided that they were discussed in relation to the general framework. We have not yet got our World Courtagain, but there are friendly States and neutral States from whom competentjudges might be found.14. Let me say also that I have never advocated competitive &quot; bigness &quot; inany sphere between our two countries in their present state of development. Youwill have the greatest Navy in the world. You will have I hope the greatest AirForce. You will have the greatest trade. You have all the gold. But these things do not oppress my mind with fear because I am sure the American peopleunder your re-acclaimed leadership will not give themselves over to vaingloriousambitions, and that justice and fair-play will be the lights that guide them.
Twelve hours before its despatch to the President I sent it to Lord Swintonfor his confidential information under cover of the following telegram : Prime Minister to Lcmn Swinton. T. 2199/4.Personal and Top Secret.1. The Civil Aviation Committee consulted over the weekend, and cabinet considered the whole matter this morning. Our decision, after having testedall points of view, is expressed in my immediately following addressed to thePresident, which will not be sent off till 12 hours after this so that you maybe first informed.2. We do nob feel that what Mr. Howe once called &quot; Basic Rights &quot; likeFreedoms One and Two can be used to dominate the settlement of FreedomsThree, Four and Five. With our Empire spread across the world, we shouldtake up an indefensible position if we sought to get our way on Three, Fourand Five by denying and, as the Americans would say, strangulating the progressof world aviation. In all the great wars that Great Britain has fought sinceQueen Elizabeth, we have always kept ourselves alive and victorious becauseour interests were identical with the main body of mankind and with the spiritof freedom and progress. We could never now turn round and deny the rightof innocent passage to the aircraft of the world. Still less could we concede the right of innocent passage and fight on Freedom Two, which would lead usto refuse refuelling and repair to aircraft to which we had granted the rightof innocent passage. This would be simply unenforceable. The aircraft wouldland and would have to be refuelled or repaired, unless they were to accumulatein stacks at our airfields or resume their flight under conditions of danger.3. I am deeply alarmed lest Berle should switch off the highly-debatablepoints Three, Four and Five, with Escalator and Duplicator thrown in, andrepresent that the Conference has broken down on a British refusal to allowAmerican aircraft to refuel or repair at British stations. Nobody could argueon this, especially to a Nation to whom we owe enormous money debts and alsoa degree of comradeship and generosity never surpassed in all the alliances of history.4. Pray therefore address yourself to your problems in the light of these comments and of my telegram to President Roosevelt. The Dominions are nowbeing informed by Cranborne of our position, which is unalterable. You should of course acquaint our Delegation.5. Apart from this, I do not see that much can be done till we have the presidents answer, and you should use damping-down and dilatory processesuntil we communicate with you again.6. Pray note that all the bargaining power of taking up passengers atintermediate stops is reserved to us. This is all that can be disputed amongfree and victorious Allies.(Intld.) W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,5th December, 1944.
