(44) 6752yd November, 1944WAR CABINETTHE POLITICAL SITUATION IN INDIANOTE BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARI circulate for the information of my colleagues the attached letter which I havereceived from the Prime Minister of the Punjab.The War Office,23rd November, 1944.P. T. G.annex copy of a letter dated 18th September, 1944 to Sir James Grigg from Nawab MalikKhizar Hay at Khan Tiwana.1. I can well imagine how busy you must be at present and I must ask you to forgiveme for troubling you with this long letter. -I venture to do so because of the urgentimportance of my subject.2. The clear signs of approaching Allied victory have led to a quickening of political activity in India. Many political parties are seeking to strengthen their position in order togather the fruits of a victory to which they have contributed nothing. Some of these parties have adopted an attitude of barren non-cooperation and others have done all in their powerto hamper at critical moments the Allied cause and the war effort of India. without exception, these parties have used the grave crisis through which Britain and India have passed to bargain for their own ends. They refused their aid when their country most needed it, preferring to sit on the fence and to haggle for the grant of their unreasonabledemands while others, more patriotic than they, gave unstintingly all the help in their power. These non-cooperative bargainers now hope to secure, first, the solution in their favour of the present political deadlock, and, later, the framing of India&apos;s constitution in a manner which will give them all that they want.3. All patriotic Indians desire the end of the present political impasse and hope for a self-governing India as soon after the war as possible. Those Indians who have shown theirpatriotism by giving unstinted aid and co-operation in the most perilous hours of the war,desire to see these burning questions solved no less than the so-called patriots who thoughtonly of turning India&apos;s danger to their own advantage. There is a growing fear among those Indians who have loyally supported the war effort of the United Nations, that whenthe fu ture of their country is being decided their voices will go unheard in the clamourraised by the more vocal groups who have stood apart from the Allies and who claim to bethe sole representatives of India. It is in the hope of preventing such an injustice that I amaddressing you, confident that you will agree that those who have played the leading part inIndia&apos;s war, should have a deciding voice in determining her future.4. The. fear to which I have given expression is not, I am sure, unfounded. After thelast Great War, when India was granted a new constitution which advanced her some wayalong the road to complete self-government, it was announced that this was a reward for thevahant part which India&apos;s soldiers and peoples had played in that struggle. Nevertheless,the interests and desires of those Indians who had played the most prominent part inwinning victory were subordinated to those of Indians who had played no part or a veryminor one.   Their voices went unheard when decisions were made.   India&apos;s demobilised
soldiers were treated with ingratitude and lack of consideration. Their justified discontentwas used to create unrest and turmoil by those whose aim was to spread disaffectionthroughout the country. British officers, like Sir Michael 0&apos;Dwyer, and Indian loyalists,who had worked devotedly to save the Empire, were not supported. They were left unaidedto face the abuse and unrestrained attacks on men who had no claim to the gratitude of either Britain .or India. If it is desired to avoid a storm similar to that whichswept India in the years following the last war; these errors must not be repeated. It isessential that there should be a well-conceived and co-ordinated, plan for dealing withdemobilised soldiers, giving full recognition to their claims based on service and sacrifice.This plan must be made and executed by sympathetic and understanding authorities, and theex-soldiers must not be exposed to the tender mercies of a Government dominated by political parties who have no sympathy or understanding for them. It is no less essentialthat there should be no abandonment and betrayal, in the face of political pressure, of loyalofficers and friendly Indians who have unflinchingly done their duty.5. In the political sphere, the people of Britain tend naturally to judge Indian questionsb3^ British standards and in the light of British conditions. In Britain, public opinion on important questions in the long run determines Government action, and public opinion isjudged by what appears in the press of the country and by the utterances of the variouspolitical organizations. This works well enough in Britain where all sections of the publicare organized and have a press to publish their views. In India, the press and the utterancesof political leaders do not provide a safe guide to the real wishes and interests of the people.Ninety per cent, of the population is inarticulate and the press is dominated by industrial and commercial capitalists. The inarticulate mass of the people who are politicallyunorganized, form the preater part of the rural population and this includes the enlisted andloyal classes. Their interest and views are, more often than not, opposed to those of thevocal industrialists and politicians.6. No doubt, an impression is created in the minds of those ignorant of India&apos;s peculiarconditions, that the Indian National Congress and the All-India Moslem League betweenthem represent the viewpoints of all India as they claim to do. This is by no means so.The popularity of Congress is confined to certain sections of the people. Its strength isbased largely on the wealth of many of its members and its popularity has beenearned by the preaching, in season and out of season, of hatred of Britain. Alien rule isdistasteful to every country and community and the Congress has earned cheap popularityby exploiting this distaste to the full. It has made full use of the opportunities afforded bythe lack of firmness and determination on the part of an administration which has alwaysretreated before the demands of this vociferous minority. For all its claims to the contrary,the Congress had done nothing to promote the welfare of the masses. The half-hearted debt and agrarian legislation of a few Congress ministries was meant to divert the attention of thepeople from industrial and commercial problems. The Congress is dominated by, anddevoted to the interests of, Indian capitalists and seeks to strengthen their position againstforeign competition at the expense of the great bulk of the people who are consumers andgrowers of foodstuffs and raw materials.7. The Muslim League is less popular and has much less prestige than the Congress, andits popularity and prestige are as ephemeral as they are artificial. The general opinion inIndia is that the League owes much to the encouragement of the British who have sought init a counterpoise to the Congress. Its influence in the towns is considerable and growing,but it has little influence in rural areas, though it is beginning to infiltrate into them. Aswith the Congress, its popularity is based on the preaching of hatred hatred against the hindus and, on occasions, hatred against the British for their alleged reluctance to part with power or for alleged hostility to Muslim countries.8. My brief discussion of the position of Congress and the Muslim League is intended toemphasise that it cannot be assumed that these organizations represent the classes whosecause I plead. These classes are predominantly rural and agricultural whereas the congress and League are urban and largely non-martial, and have no traditions of loyalty or service.The Congress is predominantly Hindu and the League is entirely Muslim, whereas the en-iisted and loyalist classes, who have supported the war effort, have many interests in commonirrespective of community. I ask that they should be given an effective voice in any discussions on the solution of the present deadlock and of India&apos;s future constitution questions in which they are vitally interested. At the Peace Conference which will meetafter the war, those Powers which have risked all to defeat the common enemy willhave a deciding voice in solving international problems not those which have stood asidefrom the struggle or have opposed the Allies. This just principle should apply to Indiaalso. Those who have worked hard and loyally that India might play a worthy part in thestruggle, should be listened to and not those who have stood apart from and sabotagedIndia&apos;s war effort.9. I cannot speak with certainty of other parts of India, but I can speak for the Punjab.A great wave of loyalty has swept the Province, similar to that which swept it in 1857.I believe that there is also a surge of loyalty in other parts of India which have not. been
affected by seditious movements. Of the wave of loyalty in the Punjab no further proof is needed than the fact that we have furnished more than twice the number of recruits thatwe furnished in the last war and the fine response of certain other parts of India indicates that there also is a wave of loyalty. The force of this loyalist movement must not be wasted : it should be conserved and exploited for the common advantage of India and of britain. The loyalists are no less anxious for self-government than the non-cooperators,but they understand the value of, and desire to- preserve, the British connection and to seeIndia as a free and equal partner of the British Commonwealth of Nations. They haveshown their love of their country by their deeds and not by the declamation of emptyphrases, and they would prefer to see India a free and equal member of a great company ofpeoples rather than an isolated, discordant and weak country occupying a most importantstrategic position, and, therefore, exposed to the greed and attacks of every selfish aggressor,and unable to defend herself because of her isolation from her true friends.10. I am sorry to have inflicted so long a letter upon you, but I feel that the importance ofthe issues justifies it. I have written to you as one who knows India and who, as Secretaryof State for &quot;War in His Majesty&apos;s Government, will have at heart the interests of soldiersthroughout the Empire. I would ask that if the Prime Minister can find a little time in themidst of his many pre-occupations, you will be so kind as to acquaint him with the purportof this letter and to lay before him my urgent request. I ask for the British Government tomake a declaration that in deciding the future of India, the enlisted and loyalist classes whohave supported the war effort of the United Nations so faithfully and well, shall be given anindependent voice and that due weight will be given to the views that they express. It isnot my object to suggest in any detail what those views will be whatever they are, mypurpose will be served if they can be freely expressed and if I am assured that they will besympathetically considered.II. I have to make one last request. Brigadier Brayne has recently gone to Englandon short leave. I have asked him to see you on my behalf and would ask you to be so kind asto receive him. Among British officers, I consider him remarkable for his unstanding of rural India and his unfailing sympathy for the man who handles the plough in peace andthe rifle in war.* * *J(B44/188)   no   11/44   w.o.p.   20063
