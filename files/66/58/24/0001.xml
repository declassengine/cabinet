/THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP Bit BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 674.22nd November, 1944.IWAR CABINET.ARGENTINE MEAT SUPPLIES.Memorandum by the Paymaster-General.1. The Americans have asked us to arrange our meat purchases from theArgentine in a manner that will assist them in their policy towards that country.I do not wish to offer&apos; any comments on the merits of that policy. But I think itmay be useful to set out the reasons why I think it would be a mistake to pressour views on a long-term Argentine meat contract at a time when we are trying to secure very great advantages from the United States.2. It is well to remember, in the first place, what we are asking the UnitedStates to do for us. Not only are we asking them for Lend-Lease supplies inone year totalling nearly  1,500 million; we are asking them to stretch to thelimit their interpretation of Lend-Lease, which by law can only be given in orderto promote the defence of the United States. We are asking them, for example,for tobacco for civilians, for prefabricated houses, for building materials, even for domestic furniture and stoves, to be supplied on Lend-Lease. We are asking themto give us Lend-Lease cotton, and at the same time complete freedom toi exportcotton goods. We are asking them to find ways and means of maintaining our gold and dollar balances at a satisfactory level. Perhaps most important in this context, we have asked them for over 700,000 tons of meat of all sorts more than we get from the Argentine and very much more than is necessary to maintain our present, level of consumption. They are doing everything they can to meet us in all these matters, although they realise how difficult it may be to justifysuch decisions to Congress and to the American people.3. Although much satisfactory progress has been made in the negotiations,it must be remembered that final agreement has not yet been reached on a numberof important points; and that it&apos; is essential, in view of the attitude of the Houseof Commons, that we should get a final agreement on export freedom before theend of this month. Even when all the agreements have been signed, much will depend on the spirit in which they are carried out. In any event, I am sure theCabinet would not wish to hold up a decision until the Americans had signed the Stage II agreement in order to take a strong adverse line thereafter.4. So much for what we are asking the Americans to do for us. Whatdo they ask us to do for them ? They are not asking us to cut our meat ration,as is sometimes believed; on the contrary, they fully recognise our need to increase our food consumption, and are doing a great deal to help us. All they are askingus to do is to assist them in their policy towards the Argentine by arrangingour meat purchases in a particular way. They have given general assurances that our meat supplies would not thereby be jeopardised, and it might well bepossible to secure some more formal undertaking.5. It is sometimes believed that the American policy towards the Argentineis personal to Mr. Hull. But it became quite clear to me, from conversations in Washington, that similar views were widely held, not only by members ofthe State Department, such as Mr. Stettinius and Mr. Acheson, but also by many outside it, including Mr. Hopkins, Mr. Morgenthau, Mr. Harriman andeven, for example, Mr. McCloy of the War Department. It also seems clear,from his recent telegrams, that the President holds the same view It may be, inview of his earlier telegrams, that he could be persuaded to withdraw his &quot;request[28658]
that we should refrain from making ia long-term contract for the time being,and to issue a directive on these lines. But it is by no means certain that thiswould not have unfavourable repercussions on the host of detailed decisions still to be given by American Ministers and officials in formulating, and even more in implementing, their Stage II policy. Nor should we forget that in the nearfuture we shall have to approach the United States for help in Stage III.Lastly, so the President assures us, the American people support vehementlythe Administration^ policy against the Argentine. Sooner or later he will haveto persuade them to underwrite his help to us in Stages II and III. It will certainly not help him in his task if we have recently gone out of our way tomake a long-term contract with the Argentine which, rightly or wrongly, willbe described in the press as an anti-American gesture.6. I find it difficult to understand why we should fight so desperately forthe right to make a four-year contract, when the advantages seem to be so slightand doubtful in relation to the advantages we hope to secure from the americans in other fields. The main argument seems to be that, unless we make a long-term contract, the Belgians, the French and the Dutch, for whom provision will inany case be made by the Combined Food Board, might enter the market andbid independently,&apos; in the hope of getting a little bit more, thereby deprivingus of supplies now and in the future, and driving up prices. Even if they didenter the market, it seems doubtful whether the effect would be appreciable.Before the war, these countries imported between them only about 5 per cent,as much beef and mutton as we did. It may be argued that, in view of the peculiar conditions now obtaining, they might wish to import considerably greater quantities in the next few years; but there have been indications recentlythat the food situation in Western Europe is not so serious as had been expected,and that the French, at any rate, intend to conserve their foreign exchange, asfar as possible, for the purchase of raw materials rather than food-stuffs. Evenif they did want to buy large quantities of meat, could they ship it? Therefrigerated, tonnage under the French, Dutch and Belgian flags is very limited,at present only about 2 per cent, of that under the British flag. If necessary,could not the Combined Food Board and the Combined Shipping AdjustmentBoard *(or whatever takes its place) be used to prevent undesirable purchases andshipments by the European Allies ? Perhaps most important of all, would thesecountries really make purchases in defiance of strong pressure from the UnitedStates ? After all, they have much to ask from the Americans; for example, theFrench want armaments and the Dutch wish to restore their position in theFar East.7. It may be argued that, unless we make a long-term contract, theArgentine meat producers will lose confidence, and will not breed and fattensteers, so that our meat supplies in 3 or 4 years&apos; time will be jeopardised. Butthey have never had a long-term contract before;, yet they have bred and fattenedsteers. The last contract was only for one year, and in the past purchases weremade for only a short period ahead. If a world shortage of meat is expected,why should the Argentines cut their production ?Even if there were some fall in output a few years hence, its importanceshould not be exaggerated. The Great Depression brought a fall of only 7 percent, in Argentine meat production between 1929 and 1932. Suppose there reallywere a fall of, say, 10 per cent, in our Argentine supplies, this would mean a loss of only about 50,000 tons 2 or 3 per cent, of our total meat supplies. Andit might well be possible to arrange for the United States, with a consumptionof something like 10 million tons, to insure us against such a trivial shortfall.8. It may be argued that, unless we make a contract soon, prices will rise.It is also possible, of course, that they might fall, especially if the French andother nations can be kept out of the market. The bargaining power of theArgentine must not be overestimated; it is true that we cannot get on without taking their meat, but equally they cannot carry on for long without our market.But even if prices did rise, how serious would it be? A rise of, say, 20 per cent,on meat imports from the Argentine of the order of, say,  50 million would costus  10 million, which is surely trivial in relation to the  1,500 million that weare asking from the Americans.9. Finally, even if there be advantages in a long-term contract, why is there any great hurry? Why cannot we postpone it for a time to meet the urgentwishes of the Americans ? We have never had such a long contract before&quot; andwe have not come to any harm.
10. I hope, therefore, that we shall not press for an early negotiation of along-term, contract. True, it might give us slightly greater security for our meatsupplies provided, of course, all Argentine Governments treat contracts assacred. As against this, it might well jeopardise our obtaining, in the first year of Stage II,  250 million worth of food, not to mention well over  1,000 millionworth of other supplies. Surely our best course would be to tell the americans that, though we must have our meat, we would gladly arrange our purchases insuch a way as to help their policy, and to work out with them some plan by whichthis might be put into effect.C.Great George Street, S. W. 1,21st November, 1944.
