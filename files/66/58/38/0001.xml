/THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 11OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 688.?Ath November, 1944.WAR CABINET.RE-ALLOCATION OF MAN-POWER BETWEEN THE FORCES and civilian EMPLOYMENT DURING ANY INTERIM period between THE DEFEAT OF GERMANY AND THE defeat of JAPAN.1. I regret that I cannot agree with the proposal in the memorandum bythe Minister of Labour and National Service (W.P. (44) 673) that the majorityrecommendation of the Inter-Departmental Committee should be accepted in sofar as it relates to the group of men who may conveniently be referred to as the&quot;Dunkirk&quot; firemen.2. There are, I think, strong arguments in favour of allowing any periodspent in the Fire Service, whether before or after the nationalisation of theService, or for that matter in other forms of Civil Defence, to count as &apos;&apos; war service &apos;&apos; in the case of men subsequently called up to the Armed Forces; but i recognise the Minister of Labour&apos;s difficulties in equating such service generally with military service, and I do not press it. But the case for making an exceptionin favour of the &quot; Dunkirk &quot; firemen, whose period of fire service fell between two periods of military service is, in my view, overwhelming.3. The objections are stated to be that to concede this claim would open the door to similar claims by other men on temporary release, and that it would bedifficult to discriminate between this group and other men who were in the fire service during the same period and were subsequently called up.4. On the first point, I submit that there is a distinction in kind betweenthe position of men who were released temporarily for industrial work atindustrial rates, and that of the &quot; Dunkirk &quot; firemen, who were transferred fromone uniformed Service to another and be it remembered, to the heavy raiding of late 1940 and 1941 and during this spell of fire service duty received no morethan the pay prescribed for that Service. To exclude the latter involvesdiscrimination, not merely against individuals but against the Service of whichthey were members.5. As regards the second objection, there is a fundamental distinction whichcan legitimately be drawn between men who had not previously been in the Armyand those who, having already been in the Army, were subsequently recalled toit. The case for the latter was put forcibly by the Member for Kincardine and western in the course of the recent debate (Hansard, the 15th November,Col. 2060). They were primarily soldiers, whose period of military service was interrupted because they responded to a call for volunteers to undertake other service which at the time was considered to be more urgent. During the periodwhile they were engaged in fire fighting they were members of the Reserve, and liable to recall, and it was made clear from the first that they would, in fact, be recalled if they attempted to leave the Fire Service for any other occupation. Theywere given no reason to expect that their temporary release from the Army would prejudice their ultimate position in the demobilisation scheme; and it would, i submit, be unjust to deprive them of the advantage of counting this service because,The Dunkirk Firemen.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.[28687]
for the time being, they wore a different uniform and were subject to a differentform of control, and because it is considered impracticable to make a correspondingconcession to other firemen who had not previously been called up for militaryservice.6. I should add that the total number of men involved is small, that they willbe readily identifiable and that the period of service during release from the Armycan be precisely determined. The Demobilisation Committee of the War Cabinet,under the Chairmanship of Sir William Jowitt, recommended that an exceptionshould be made in their favour (W.P. (43) 494, paragraph 51); and I submit thata decision to allow this period of service to count towards the computation oftheir &quot; war service &quot; could safely be taken, without in any way prejudicing thegeneral validity of the definition of &quot; war service,&quot; Such a decision, however,would be consistent with most people&apos;s views of common justice.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall, S. W. 1,24th November, 1944.
