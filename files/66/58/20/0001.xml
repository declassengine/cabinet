THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 670-20 A November, 1944.WAR CABINET.MORALE AND WELFARE IN THE FAR EAST.Directive by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.1. I have issued a directive to the Viceroy and to Commanders-in-Chiefconcerned impressing upon them the importance which I attach to measures forthe improvement of the morale and well-being of the forces in the Far Easterntheatres. There are a number of directions in which action must be taken by departments at home in furtherance of this object.Air Transport and Mails.2. The target we should set is that by the 1st March. 1945, or when germany is defeated, whichever is the earlier, all letter mail to the Far East should go by air. In the meantime the Overseas Mails Committee should make the best possibleplan for improving the mail service, speed of delivery being the primary con-sideration. It is not possible to draw a distinction between the service to thedifferent ships at sea all over the world. The most generous treatment possible should be accorded with the minimum delay to the troops fighting in the junglewho have the longest tour abroad, and whose conditions are the most arduous.3. The evacuation of casualties, the conveyance of fresh food and othercomforts, the movement of entertainment parties and other important servicesall require a larger scale of air transport than has been accorded heretofore.The Admiralty, the War Office and the Ministry of War Transport, shouldformulate their requirements, and then the Air Ministry should draw up a plan to meet them, and should show what this plan will involve.A accommodation and A menities.4. I rely on Departments to take all possible steps to meet the demands,for materials, equipment and stores required for the amelioration of conditions inleave centres, camps, &amp;c, in the Far East. Special difficulties should be reportedto me so that obstacles can be overcome.[28575]
Beer.5.   A substantial increase in the amount of beer available to men in theFar Eastern theatres must be achieved.   This can be done by a combination oftwo methods :  *(a) the increased supply of barley and hops to India, Ceylon, and to anybreweries which may be established in ships supplying and servicingthe Fleet;(b) a reduction-in the quantity of beer available for civilian consumption in this country and an increase in the amount exported, whether inbottles or cans.6. The standard to be aimed at is production sufficient to provide everyBritish soldier, sailor and airman serving overseas with a minimum of four pintsof beer per week. It will be for the Minister of Food, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, to formulate the necessary plans.Cinemas and Wireless.7. A report should be made by the Minister of Production on the present programme for the provision of cinema and wireless equipment from this countryand the United States of America, together with a statement of any measures necessary to ensure the early fulfilment of requirements.Houses and Furniture for ex-Service Men.8. Consideration to the fact that an applicant for a house is a Serviceman, an ex-Service man or his wife, should be given in assessing priorities forallotment. These people must be assured of the possibility of setting up theirown homes, and, among these, preference should be given to the wives and families of men retained in the Far Eastern theatre after the defeat of Germany.A report should be made by the Minister of Health and the President of the Boardof Trade on the present system, and on the modifications which would be requiredin it to meet this need.Information for the Men in the Forces.9. It is important that Service men overseas should be able to keep abreastof the more important developments in social policy at home. Ministriesresponsible for new legislation on matters of major importance should produceaccurate and unbiased pamphlets, on the lines of that issued on the social security Scheme, for distribution to Service men and merchant seamen.Doctors and Nurses.10. In planning the allocation between the Services and civilian require-ments for doctors and nurses in 1945, full weight should be given to the acuteneed for doctors and nurses in the Far Eastern theatres.
o 9Indoctrination.11. It is necessary that the people at home and the men serving abroad,or liable to be sent abroad, should be fully informed on all aspects of the war inthe Far East. It is natural that at present attention should be focussed on events in the European theatre. The Ministry of Information are developing plans for extending publicity about the Far Eastern war, which should be worked up to full force when Germany is defeated. Departments should give them their earnestand active co-operation. Some of the measures which have to be taken call forsacrifices not only on the part of the troops but on the part of the people at home.Full explanations should be given of such matters so that people will be fully(  aware of the reasons.W.
