THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PkoPEktY OE HIS iJKlTANNIC MAJESTYJS GOYEBNMjjsNTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 693.16th November, 1944.Copy No; 1)4631WAR CABINET.CIVIL AIR TRANSPORT.Note by the Prime Minister.I have received the following telegram from President Roosevelt : T. 2176/4.   24.11.44.I have read carefully the message in your 827. I am afraid you do not vetfully appreciate the importance of reaching a satisfactory agreement. our people have gone as far to meet yours as I can let them go. If the conference should end either in no agreement or in an agreement which the American people would regard as preventing the development and use of the great air routes, the repercussions would seriously affect many other things.We are doing our best to meet your Lend-Lease needs. We will face congress on that subject in a few weeks and it will not be in a generous mood if it and thepeople feel that the United Kingdom has not agreed to a generally beneficial airagreement. They will wonder about the chances of our two countries, let aloneany others, working together to keep the peace if we cannot even get together onan aviation agreement.I hope you will review the situation once more and see if we cannot get together.I propose to send the following reply : 1. Winant has brought me your message about the Air in reply to myNo. 827, and naturally it has caused me much anxiety. I agree with you thatthis is a grave matter in which not only Governments but Parliaments and peoples may become deeply agitated, with consequences which cannot fail to be disastrous both to the prosecution of the war and to the prevention of futurewars. I feel it my duty therefore to place before you in simple terms the issue as it presents itself to me after hearing all the advice of the special committee under Beaverbrook, of which Stafford Cripps is an important member, as well asthe unanimous views of the War Cabinet.[28697]
2. -1 thought this Conference premature, but we deferred to your wish tohave it in America at the time you wanted.3.   The foundations of our position at this Conference are : (a) The British Empire is asked to give up invaluable and irreplaceablebases for Air transport all over the world and place them at thedisposal of such nations as are capable of using them. This meansof course primarily and in bulk placing them at the disposal of theUnited States.(b) It was agreed between us as a war measure that you should make thetransport aircraft and specialize upon them on account of the characterof the war, the need to supply China over the Hump, the vast distancesof the Pacific Ocean, &amp;c, and that we should concentrate our effortsupon fighting types. In consequence the United States are in anincomparably better position than we are to fill any needs of air transport that may arise after the war is over.We would venture most earnestly to suggest that these two points are notreceiving adequate consideration.4. However in partial recognition of the above two points, Mr. Berle reached agreement with Lord Swinton at Chicago on November 17 about the number of aircraft that should be put into service by our respective countries (frequencies)on a basis of &quot;embarked traffic.&quot; Agreement was also reached about fares toprevent undercutting, unfair subventions, &amp;c.5. All the above was satisfactory to us and, I think, to the world. OnNovember 18, however, your side of the table put forward an entirely new set of ideas and arguments which, in our judgment, took away with one hand what had been given with the other in consideration of our fundamental position setforth above in paragraphs 3 (a) and (b).6. Eor instance, the Escalator Clause was sought, not only for traffic to andfrom your country but also for traffic between any two foreign countries. this meant that the number of services on any route could be increased when an airlineachieved a load equal to 65 per cent, of its full capacity. We had already agreed,&apos; reluctantly, that this Escalator Clause should apply to traffic to and from anaircrafts own country. We had also agreed to a so-called Fifth Freedom whichwould grant to aircraft on through services the right to pick up and set downtraffic between foreign countries at intermediate stops. It is true that somesuggestion was made for a differentiation of fares to safeguard the local traffic.That seemed to me a valuable line to explore.7. Mr. Berle then asked for a combination of the Escalator Clause and the fifth Freedom which would enable American aircraft to carry most of the traffic between the United Kingdom and &quot;the Dominions and India and all foreigncountries, as well as between all nations of the Commonwealth. It would, in fact,give to United States airlines the right to everything save cabotage.
8. We must accept the fact that the arrangements about frequencies willbe very soon completely different from those agreed upon before the EscalatorClause was proposed. There is very little doubt that our position relatively toyours is markedly injured thereby. This applies not only to Great Britain butto many other durable Powers who are now in a weak condition to design and build suitable transport aircraft or to embark traffic.9. On top of this Escalator Clause, which we have conceded for traffic to; and from your country, Mr. Berle now demands the right of duplication over any section of any through route and also provision for increasing frequencies sothat any airline could carry all the intermediate traffic it could get. This mightwell mean that aircraft embarking traffic in the United States would not onlyexcel, as they are welcome to do, but dominate and virtually monopolise trafficnot only between our country and yours, but between all other foreign countries and British Dominions besides.10. I have the opinion that both this point of linking the Escalator clause and the Fifth Freedom together, and the claim for duplication on foreign air routes, require further patient study with a view to reaching agreement between our two countries. Thus we could make sure that Great Britain and theDominions and many other countries as well are not in fact run out of the Airaltogether as a result of your flying start with no regard to the fact that we are willing to throw all our bases all over the world into the common pool. I am sureI could not obtain the agreement of the Cabinet or of either House of Parliamentto anything which bore that aspect.   Nor would I try.11. It may be that you will say I have not rightly posed the issues. Ifthis be so, I would be most grateful if you would state them in your own words.Is it suggested, for instance, that we are going to challenge the right of innocentpassage in Freedom I, or the consequential right of refuelling and repair inFreedom II, except in so far as these are mixed up in the much more refined issues arising out of your doctrines of Escalator and duplication 1 There may well be other simplifications which could be made.12. Should it not be possible for us to reach an agreement at this stage,when great battles in which our troops are fighting side by side are at theirheight and when we are preparing for immense new further efforts against Japan,I cannot see that a temporary adjournment to allow of the aforesaid patientdiscussions would do any serious harm. On the contrary, I believe that it wouldbe as readily understood as was the postponement of final decision at DumbartonOaks. There is always the great body of technical matter upon which agreement has been secured. Therefore unless complete agreement is reached, I plead thatthere shall be an adjournment. Such adjournment for a short time, if asked forby an intimately-Allied Power like us, ought not to be denied, nor ought we tobe confronted with such very serious contingencies as are set out in your messagereceived on Saturday. An open dispute carried on by Parliament and Congress,both of which would have to be informed, and in our voluble Free Press on both
sides, would do far more harm to the war effort and to our hopes of the futurethan an adjournment of a few weeks or even months, while both parties perse-vered behind the scenes for a settlement.13. It is my earnest hope that you will not bring into this Air discussion the prospect of our suffering less generous treatment on Lend-Lease than wehad expected from the Quebec discussions. But even if I thought that we wereto be so penalized, T would not feel myself able to agree to a decision contrary tothe merits, as we see them, of this matter. )14. I should,be ready, of course, to accept impartial arbitration on thepoints outstanding at the Chicago Conference, provided that they were discussed in relation to the general framework. We have not yet got our World Courtagain, but there are friendly States and neutral States from whom competentjudges might be found.15. Let me say also that I have never advocated competitive &quot;bigness&quot;in any sphere between our two countries in their present state of development.You will have the greatest Navy in the world. You will have I hope the greatestAir Force. You will have the greatest trade. You have all the gold. But these things do not oppress my mind with fear because I am sure the American peopleunder your re-acclaimed leadership will not give themselves over to vaingloriousambitions, and that justice and fair-play will be the lights that guide tJhem.w. s. c.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,2Qth November, 1944.
