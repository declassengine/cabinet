THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 672.21st November, 1944.WAR CABINET.LOCAL ELECTIONS.RETIREMENT OF COUNCILLORS.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.THE War Cabinet at its meeting on the 8th November (W.M. (44)148th Conclusions, Minute 4) decided that provision should be made for retire-ment by annual thirds in Councils where this had hitherto been the practice, onthe understanding that, in any ward where there was a co-opted member heshould retire first.2. In connection with the drafting of the Local Elections Bill, we havebeen considering how this Conclusion would work in practice, and we find thatit involves a serious anomaly which it might be difficult to defend in 1/arliamentand to which we think that we should draw the attention of our colleagues before proceeding further.3. There will be many cases in which, taking a Council as a whole, co-optedcouncillors will retain their membership on a Council while councillors electedbefore 1939 will have to retire.4. For example, in a Borough containing four wards, each with threecouncillors, if in Ward A all three councillors were co-opted while in theremaining three wards all councillors were elected prior to 1939, the effect wouldbe that only one co-opted councillor would retire in 1945 from Ward A whilethree elected councillors would have to retire from the other three wards (one from each).5. What is more, complicated and somewhat lengthy provisions in the bill will be required to settle the rotation for retirement of co-opted councillors, aswell as of councillors elected prior to 1939, in cases where wards are represented by six or nine councillors. It will.be necessary, for example, to provide for determing which of three co-opted councillors in a ward returning sixcouncillors should retire. Provision would also have to be made for determining,where there is &quot;only one co-opted councillor, which of the councillors elected before1939 should retire with him.6. As to the likely public and Parliamentary reaction, we think that weshould call the attention of the Cabinet to a reference in the Press since the dateof the Cabinet decision to the undesirability of restarting local elections on thebasis of retirement by annual thirds. A leading article in a widely-read Londonnewspaper (reproduced in the annex to this memorandum) indicates the line which critics of the Bill may be expected to take if it embodies the principleof retirement by thirds. It shows that we may be attacked from the Right no less than from the Left on the ground that the proposal is undemocratic.7. We do not relish the prospect of defending in Parliament against likelyattacks from all quarters a provision which involves the anomaly described, and still less that of defending the continuance in office of councillors some of whom have already served for nine instead of the normal three years.8.   A further objection felt in many quarters is that the co-opted councillorsthough thev may bear the same label as their predecessors, are not necessarily themen whom the electors would themselves have chosen to fill the vacancy, and criticswill no doubt not fail to suggest that vacancies have been filled by jobberv[28657]
9. We recognise that there is substance in the argument of continuity in local government, to which the one-third principle gives effect in the municipalboroughs and those district Councils where it applies.10. On the other hand, even the force of this argument should not be over-estimated. There are already general elections or &apos;&apos; clean sweeps &apos;&apos; in all CountyCouncil, Metropolitan Borough and some District Council elections, no less than for the House of Commons, and, in any event, the balance of parties on a council with a small majority can be tipped one way or the other at one or more annualelections.11. In all the circumstances, therefore, we are satisfied that the balance ofadvantage lies with a general retirement (at the first elections only) as we.originally recommended, and we think it right to ask the Cabinet to reconsider the matter. Meanwhile, the drafting of the remaining provisions of the Bill which was unavoidably delayed by the previous Cabinet discussions is beingproceeded with as rapidlv as possible.H. M.T. J.Whitehall, S.W.1,21st November, 1944.ANNEX.Extract from a London Newspaper of 13th November, 1944.DOWN in the Borough of Barnes the Jolly Roger has been nailed to themast of the Council House. Ranged beneath it, and reinforced by their localnewspaper, stand the majority of the Councillors. Intrepidly the Fathers of theBorougn face an opposing phalanx of the Home Office and the Association of municipal Corporations in baleful combination. Into these official visages theyhave thrown the gage, challenging an issue whose outcome will be of more thanlocal significance in the many-fronted war of bureaucracy versus freedom.In normal.times, in November of each year, one-third of borough councillorsretire in rotation, and their full complement is made up by the local residents&apos;vote. Since 1938 there have been no elections. The Councils that were sittingthen are sitting now, Methuselahs in office. The gaps that Time alone has madein their ranks they have filled by the expedient of co-option. In the result, theconduct of local affairs to-day rests in the control of representatives, some ofwhom Last sought the public confidence anything from six to nine years ago, therest of whom have never sought it at all.Nevertheless, the Association of Municipal Corporations, being sounded bythe Home Office, without consulting the Councils who are its constituent members,has recommended that at the next election none but the unlucky third shouldretire. To this, the Councillors of Barnes, by self-denying ordinance, have returned a resounding : &quot; Never ! All of us must go!. Our time is overdue. for six years and more we have ruled without responsibility. All this time we havegraced the Council Chamber, but never the hustings. The people of Barnes, theonly source of our authority, have overlong been silent. At the very first oppor-tunity, the whole three-thirds of us must venture forth and, in the name andspirit of democracy, face the perils of the vote.&quot;Let all who love liberty raise a cheer for the wise and worthy Senators ofBarnes. Their borough motto is : &quot; Not for ourselves alone.&quot; They have indeedset an example to be followed. All local councillors who seek shelter from the vote for another year or two by digging in behind the &apos;&apos; one-third rule &apos;&apos; must bewinkled out. The rule was designed to avoid Councils overfull of novices in the science of government. It was not designed to perpetuate Councils packed withprofessors in the art of self-preservation. What is good enough for membersof Parliament should be good enough for the professors. They must submit them-selves to a General Election.That same Thames which sweetly glides by Barnes broadens into the mightyriver that laps the House of Commons&apos; wall. So do local and national democracystand towards each other, the one a source, the other a conclusion, of an indivisibleflow of freedom.
