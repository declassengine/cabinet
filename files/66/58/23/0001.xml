6&apos; * 0THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No,W.P. (44) 673.21st November, 1944.WAR CABINET.RE-ALLOCATION OF MAN-POWER BETWEEN THE FORCES and civilian EMPLOYMENT DURING ANY INTERIM period between THE DEFEAT OF GERMANY AND THE DEFEAT of japan.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1. I circulate as an Annex to this paper a report submitted by the Chairmanof the Interdepartmental Committee on Release from the Forces^ and civil defence Services which was set up by a decision of the War Cabinet on the17th February, 1944 (W.M. (44) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 2 (2)). The reportdeals with the definition of &apos;; war service &apos;&apos; for the purpose of determining therelative order of priority of release from the Forces and contains recommenda-tions regarding service in the Merchant Navy and service by men on release fromthe Army to the National Fire Service.2. Merchant Navy.The arguments in favour of putting service in the Merchant Navy on thesame basis as service in the Armed Forces for this purpose are undoubtedlystrong. Throughout the war the Merchant Navy has been regarded as a ^ fourthService. Members of the Merchant Navy are eligible for awards (including the1939/43 Star) under conditions analogous to those applied to men in the royal navy. Similarly, if they are disabled as a result of enemy action of special war risks at sea they are eligible for pensions on scales and conditions based upon those laid down for members of the Royal Navy. The Reconstruction Committeehave approved as an administrative rule for use in all Departments a definition of &apos;&apos; ex-service &apos;&apos; which includes service in the Merchant Navy. The adoptionof the proposal would avert serious anomalies which would be very difficult todefend, and the only doubt is whether it might open the door to further extensions of the definition of &quot;war service.&quot; Service in the Merchant Navy is, however,generally regarded as in a class by itself amongst war-time civilian occupations and there can be no doubt that public opinion would regard this recognition asjustified. I accordingly suggest to my colleagues that approval be given to the unanimous recommendation of the Interdepartmental Committee.3. Ex-firemen released from  the  Army  to the National Fire  Service  and&apos;subsequently recalled.The case in favour of counting service in the National Fire Service whilston release from the Army as &apos;&apos; war service &apos;&apos; is that the men concerned, some3,900 in number, were badly needed as firemen during the heavy air attacks onthis country and were released temporarily for this specific purpose. Unless theirfire service isscredited to them they will count their spells of service in the armed forces but not the intermediate period during which they were on urgent dutyin the national interest. I consider, however, that if this service were allowedto count towards priority of release from the Forces, the door would be openedto other claims which would be very difficult to resist. Not only would there bethe claims of other men on temporary release, but there would also be the difficultyof discriminating between the men covered by this proposal and those who[28659]
served in the National Fire Service during the same period and were subsequentlycalled up. If these further claims had to be accepted it would be hard to resist the contention that service in other forms of Civil Defence before enlistmentshould also count. I suggest, therefore, that the majority recommendation of the interdepartmental Committee on this subject should be approved.E. BMinistry of Labour and National Service, S.W.1.21st November, 1944.ANNEX.DEFINITION OF &quot;WAR SERVICE.&quot;Report by the Chairman of the Interdepartmental Committee on release from the Forces and Civil Defence Services.1. The White Paper on Re-allocation of Man-power between the armed forces and Civilian Employment during any Interim Period between the defeat of Germany and the Defeat of Japan (Cmd. 6548) lays down that men will normally be released from the Armed Forces by release groups based on a com-bination of age and length of war service. War service for this purpose is defined in the White Paper as meaning in general &apos;&apos; Whole-time service in the armed Forces since 3rd September, 1939, which counts for Service pay.&quot; Ithas, however, been proposed that the definition of &quot;war service&quot; should beextended to include (1) service in the Merchant Navy, (2) service in the national fire Service by ex-firemen during a period of release from the Army for thatpurpose. The effect of adopting these proposals would be that such service would count in the same way as service in the Armed Forces for the purpose of determining the relative order of priority of release from the Forces.2. The proposals have been considered by the Interdepartmental Committeewho recommend &apos;(1) that service in the Merchant Navy during the war before enlistmentin the Armed Forces should be regarded as &apos;&apos; war service &apos;&apos;;(2) that service in the National Fire Service by men on release from theArmy should not be regarded as &quot; war service.&quot; The Home Office,Ministry of Home Security and Scottish Office dissent -from this conclusion.3. As the adoption of either of these suggested extensions will involve animportant departure from the White Paper proposals, it is considered that theapproval of Ministers should be sought to the Committee&apos;s recommendations.4. It should be explained that the recommendation regarding service inthe Merchant Navy was only intended to apply to recognised Merchant Seamen,i.e., men who qualify for British Seamen&apos;s Identity Cards, pensions under the mercantile Marine Scheme and the award of the 1939/43 Star, &amp;c. Since theCommittee considered this question, however, representations have been receivedabout the position of men of the Fishing Fleets. It would seem that similar treatment should be extended to such of these men as are eligible for the samepensions and awards as Merchant Seamen, provided the necessary evidence oftheir services in the Fishing Fleets is available, and the Committee propose toconsider the matter further in the light of the Ministerial decisions on (1) and(2) above.
