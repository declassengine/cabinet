(44) 129th Conclusions, Minute 5). The need for this was the shortageof accommodation which has since been stressed in W.P. (4.4) 655 circulated by theSecretary of State for War on the 16th November, 1944.2. &apos; I ask for approval of the recommendations contained in paragraph 10 ofthe Report.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S. W. 1,24:th November, 1944.ANNEX.Inter-Departmental Committee for the Allocation of Prisoners-of-W^ar..&apos;Report on War Office proposal to stop further transfers of Italian prisoners:from Africa and to increase the employment of German prisoners.THE War Cabinet decided on the 29th September, 1944 (W.M. (44) 129thConclusions, Minute 5), that any proposal for stopping the transfer of italian prisoners-of-war to this country in accordance with the agreed programme should&apos;be submitted to the Prime Minister after consultation with the other ministers concerned.2. The proposal, made by the Secretary of State for War, that such-transfers should be stopped arises out of the need to release the maximum amount of accommodation for German prisoners due to come to this country from France. From the man-power standpoint, the acceptability of this proposaldepends on the extent to which the loss resulting from the non-transfer of furtherItalians from Africa can be made good by employing Germans.3. The Inter-Departmental Committee for the Allocation of Prisoners ofWar have therefore considered (a) in general, whether more German prisonerscan now be employed; and (b) in particular, whether they can be employed insuch a way as to make good, in whole or in part, the loss which would result from the non-transfer of further Italians.4. The main obstacle to extending the use of German prisoners lies in thesecurity restrictions imposed on their employment, in particular the rule thatthey may be employed only in groups under armed escort. The present programme for the employment of 15,000-16,000 Germans in agriculture and forestry approved by the War Cabinet (W.M. (44) 101st Conclusions, Minute 3)is practically completed and while the security restrictions remain unaltered,no material expansion of this programme is possible.[28684]
5. The Committee have, therefore, sought the views of the SecurityExecutive on the feasibility of relaxing the present restrictions. The SecurityExecutive agreed that, from the security point of view, there would be noobjection as an experiment to the Agricultural Departments and the Ministryof Supply employing, in addition to the 16,000 employed in groups under armedescort, up to 20,000 German prisoners in small, unescorted groups in agricultural and forestry work in rural areas outside the Eastern and London Regions,subject to the following conditions :-(a) The Military Authorities and the Chief Constable of the district con-cerned to be consulted before Germans are put into employment inany particular place :(b) All German prisoners to continue to live in wire camps and to be takento work and brought home under escort;(c) No members of submarine crews or the German Air Force or knownardent Nazis to be employed;(d) Unescorted German prisoners not to be employed side by side withItalian prisoners or co-operators.The Security Executive also recommend strongly that if such a programme is introduced the Ministry of Information should be supplied with both a presshand-out and material on which to base a &quot; Private and Confidential guidanceMemorandum to Editors.&quot; The Security Executive point out that, when therules regarding Italian co-operators were relaxed in the summer, the Ministryof Information received a hand-out only. It was most desirable that the pressshould handle the relaxation of . rules regarding German prisoners moresympathetically than they had those regarding Italians.6. On the assumption that these relaxations will be approved by the WarCabinet, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Agriculture forScotland and the Ministry of Supply have been asked to estimate (a) To what extent they would be able to employ more German prisoners;(b) How many Italian prisoners they would then be able to release for employment by other Departments in place of the Italian prisonersthese Departments were due to receive later this year on their arrivalfrom Africa.7. Difficulty in making firm estimates has been met because of uncertaintyregarding the availability of accommodation. It is only possible to employ more german prisoners if they are accommodated within reasonable daily travellingdistance of their work. This necessitates their accommodation in camps, satisfying the condition set out in para 5 (b) above, now occupied by Italian prisoners.These Italian prisoners have then to be found alternative accommodation. Inso far as these Italians are employed on work on which they are not to be replaced by Germans, they have to be found alternative accommodation in the neighbour-hood of the camp from which they are being displaced.. It follows that beforecamps now occupied by Italians can be used to accommodate Germans aconsiderable amount of alternative accommodation has to be found in theneighbourhood of a type suitable for Italian prisoners. There will undoubtedly be cases of delay and difficulty in finding such accommodation however, and thus it becomes impracticable to make firm estimates regarding the number of Germanswho can be employed in the immediate future. Uncertainty as to the decisions which will be reached by the Security Authorities on particular proposals (see para. 5 (a) above) increases the difficulty.8. After making full allowance for these elements of uncertainty, thefollowing estimates have been made on the two points set out in para. 6 above : Further German   Italian prisonersprisoners who      now allocated tocan be employed   them who could in the near then befuture. released..Ministry of Agriculture ...Department of Agriculture for ScotlandMinistry of Supply        ...13,000 10,000*830 8301,500 1,500Totals15,33012,330* Includes 4,000 who are not yet in their employment but are due to them out of the furthertransfers from Africa if not cancelled.
9. During the rest of 1944, the number of Italian prisoners due to betransferred from Africa according to the agreed programme is 11,000.Implementation of the arrangements set out in para. 5 above for the furtheremployment of German prisoners would, according to the estimates in thepreceding paragraph, enable more than 12,000 Italians to be released and would thus more than offset the loss that would result from a decision to stop thetransfer of further Italians from Africa.10.   The Committee accordingly recommend as follows :- ?(a) The security restrictions governing the employment of German prisonersshould be relaxed in the way suggested by the Security Executive(see para. 5 above);(b) Arrangements should be made for the employment of not more than20,000 German prisoners in agriculture and forestry on these new conditions, in addition to the 15,000-16,000 whose employment inescorted gangs has already been approved;(c) Before these arrangements are implemented, the Ministry of information should be supplied both with a press hand-out and material on which to base a &quot; Private and Confidential guidance Memorandum toEditors&quot;;(d) Further transfers of Italians to this country should be suspended, thisdecision to be subject to review if it proves impossible to employGerman prisoners to the extent estimated in para. 8 above.
