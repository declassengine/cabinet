THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 696.27th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.Copy No.GREECE.Note by the Secretary.BY direction of the Prime Minister, the attached telegram fromLieutenant-General Scobie, Commander of the Ground Forces in Greece, toGeneral Sir Henry Maitland-Wilson, is circulated to the War Cabinet and theChiefs of Staff.(Signed)E. E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1,27th November, 1944.ANNEX. ;From Athens, 25th November, 1944.Personal decipher yourself private for General Wilson&apos;s eyes only fromGeneral Scobie.   (War Office for General Wilson if already left Naples.)C.O.M.D./8.1. In this country there is widespread intimidation and victimisation inprovinces. There is no freedom of speech, no freedom of press. All is controlled by a small armed minority which is widely unpopular. Untruepropaganda is prevalent even to extent that relief supplies now arriving arenothing to do with efforts of British or Americans.2. Present Government is weak with the exception of Prime Minister andone or two others and lacks confidence of people. Without confidence there canbe no stability, and new currency with all that this entails is likely to fail.Government is failing to impose its authority on extreme Left which is extractingpiecemeal damaging and obstructive concessions.3. In order to restore confidence the country needs a firm lead which couldbe provided by a public assurance preferably by Mr. Churchill. Suggestfollowing lines: &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government intends fully to support presentGreek Government until such time as civil authority has been establishedthroughout Greece, irregular forces have been demobilised, and freedom of speech and press is prevalent throughout the country so that free elections canbe held and tihe will of the people truly expressed. British forces have been instructed to assist in the protection of the frontiers of Greece should this benecessary until this task can be fully assumed by the regular forces of the Greeknation.&quot;4. Although I have talked in no uncertain terms to Left&quot; Wing extremiststhis fact is not generally known to public at large. I feel that until british policy is broadcast throughout country which can easily be done with ourpresent resources the vast majority is in ignorance of our intentions and does notdare to voice its true feelings. I am convinced that overwhelming majority of population is praying for a lead from us.5. I am certain that any utterance by British Prime Minister will beaccepted with utmost relief by Greek population.   This could be broadcast and[28705]
disseminated by leaflet; In order to allay suspicion in U.S.A. suggest thatemphasis be placed on fact that our military presence is purely temporary untilGreece is on her feet.6. Failing this suggest that I with your permission state categorically thatI will support the legal Government in its endeavour to re-establish Greece as a free democratic nation and will not countenance any direct or indirect obstructionto the fulfilment of this task.7. (?So far) the formation of the new National Guard is proceedingreasonably satisfactorily. As a result of my recent conferences with Sarahsand Zervas have a reasonable hope that demobilisation of Andartes will proceed without serious trouble. This however only possible if Government stands firm.Lambrianides, Under-Secretary for War, removed from post yesterday owing toLeft Wing pressure.8.   Above agreed with Ambassador.  Request your early decision.
