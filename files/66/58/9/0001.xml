ft       - oTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the W&amp;r Cabinet.  [November 1944.. &apos; &apos;&apos;,SECRET. ycopy no.W.F. (44) 659. y16^A November, 1944. ^1 V   WAR CABINET. V&quot;EMPIRE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.IT is agreed that the Anzac Scheme put forward by the commonwealth communities Council should be rejected.2. The E.T.S. Committee in consequence now propose to the War Cabinetthat a representative of the British Government should be charged with the task of endeavouring to persuade the Dominions to agree to the adoption of a schemebased on the proposals of the Official Committee.   Erom this decision I dissent.3. In his Paper (E.T.S. (44) 14) the Secretary of State for the Dominionsstresses that the proposals of the Official Committee would not gain the supportof the Dominions.   I now hold to Lord C.ranborne&apos;s opinion.4. It is clear now that no good purpose could be served by the advocacyby a British Government representative of any set-up based on the official committee&apos;s Report.   We must make a fresh start.5. It is my recommendation that the Cable and Wireless Company be nowdirected to put its own house in order, without reference to any of the schemesso far put forward,- but in fullest collaboration with the commonwealth communities Council.6. The Company should, in fact, be given the opportunity (after the changes in personnel referred to below) to negotiate a new set-up for the futurewith the Dominions. And it should be made clear that any plan proposed mustgain the support of the Commonwealth Communications Council and theapproval of the British Government.7. It may be objected that the Dominions are unlikely to accept any planput forward by the Company, which has already produced a scheme which hasbeen decisively rejected by the Commonwealth Communications Council. It mayfurther be alleged that the Dominions will be unwilling to contemplate thefurther delay involved in the submission by the Company of fresh proposals, andwill in consequence break away altogether from the idea of an Imperial system.8. These objections have weight. But there are heavier disadvantagesmilitating against the proposal to negotiate with the Dominions through a BritishGovernment representative.9. If the Company now formulate a new scheme the British Governmentwill be in no way committed. For it will not consider it unless the Dominionssignify their willingness to accept it at least as a basis for discussion. And if theDominions reject the Company&apos;s scheme, the British Government will be in aposition to put forward independent and unprejudiced proposals of its own.10. But if the British Government takes an immediate initiative, its failure to carry the Dominions with it must lead to a complete and immediate deadlock.11.   Further, it may well be that the Dominions Governments will oressfor alterations in the existing set-up which will give rise to claims on theCompany&apos;s part for financial compensation.   In particular the Company havemade plain their intention to claim compensation if direct circuits between the[28631]
Dominions and the United States are continued after the war. - Since the BritishGovernment is itself a considerable shareholder in the Company, it is all themore important that it should take no part in negotiations which may give riseto Such a claim unless and until the Company shows that it cannot on its own account reach agreement with the Dominions Governments. .....12. It is necessary to make changes in personnel before undertakingnegotiations on this . issue of Empire telecommunications. The relationship between the Chairman of Cable and Wireless and the Chairman of the Common-wealth Communications Council has been in the past the biggest single factor in preventing a solution of the telecommunications problem. If that factor is removed it may be possible to restore a situation in which the just claims andthe initiative of the Company can be reconciled both with the desires of theDominions and the strategic needs of the Empire.B.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S.W. 1,16th November, 1944.
