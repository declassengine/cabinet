(44) 152nd Conclusions), I circulate the correspondence with the Viceroy, in which Lord Wavell has put forward proposals for a constitutional move. As the correspondence is very lengthyI have prefaced it with a summary of the proposals and of the arguments forand against them.The Viceroy&apos;s Proposals. ,A. The formation as soon as possible of a transitional Government at the (Be/. NJ%2&apos;Centre representative of the main political parties and functioning within the &amp; hframework of the present Constitution.   Its task would be                           . be?ou&apos;)(i) to carry on the Government of India until the new Constitution andTreaty come into force;(ii) to appoint the British India representatives&apos;to the Peace Conference andother international conferences:(iii) to consider at leisure the composition of the Constitution-making body to be set up to draft the Constitution and negotiate the treaty withHis Majesty&apos;s Government.B. As a preparatory step to A, the calling together of a small conference of (Bef. No. 1,the principal leaders and certain others. (The Viceroy asks for a free hand in p^g^J^j jthe composition of the conference, but as one possibility suggests :   Congress,Gandhi and one other; Moslem League, Jinnah and one other; Depressed Classes,Ambedkar; Sikhs, Tara Singh; Non-Congress Hindus, M. S. Aney; Non-LeagueMoslems, Khizar Hayat Khan; Labour, M. N. Roy.)Its functions would be (i) to frame agreed proposals for the composition of the transitional Govern-ment. (The Viceroy has in mind equal numbers of Hindus andMoslems, with one Sikh and one representative of the depressed classes, in addition to the Commander-in-Chief and the Governor-General) ;(ii) to consider the best means of re-establishing popular Governments inthe section 93 Provinces.JL. K. A.India Office, 22nd November, 1944.A.- Summary.
Arguments in favour.(Bef. No. i, The Viceroy considers it necessary to attempt some political advance beforepp7t&amp;&quot;f.) the end of the war, and show proof that His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined to carry &quot;out their pledges. The change over to peace conditions,demobilisation, retirements from the Civil Services, &amp;c, will make the post-war period very difficult, and it is essential to neutralise the potentialities for mischiefof the present seeds of political bitterness and unrest. Continuous inaction isprejudicial even to. the morale of the civil services. All Governors, theCommander-in-Chief, and other advisers of the Viceroy are agreed that animmediate move is essential. The failure of the Gandhi-Jinnah talks has deepenedthe sense of frustration among Indians and increased the need for a move byHis Majesty&apos;s Government. Further, it has probably made nationalist opinionmore ready than before for a compromise.(Bef. No. vii, While some Governors have made alternative suggestions, the experiencedp. 13 below.) &apos; Governors of Bombay (Sir John Colville) and the United Provinces (Sir MauriceHallett), together with the Commander-in-Chief, support the Viceroy&apos;s plan andare satisfied that it would not prejudice the war effort.(Bef. No. v, The Viceroy&apos;s main argument for his plan is that a head-on attack on thepara. 6, p. ii.) communai problem is doomed to failure; only a period of working together on india&apos;s common problems offers any hope that politicians may reach a solutionof the problem. His proposals offer the best prospect, of solving the deadlock, andhave sufficient chance of success to demonstrate our sincerity.Criticisms.(Bef. No. iv,        The Viceroy&apos;s plan contemplates the formation of a transitional Govern-pp. 8-9 below.) men  jn- advance of any settlement, or of any commitments between the parties on the future Constitution.It is highly doubtful if the principal parties would accept on this basis; in connection with the Cripps offer, and at other times. Congress hasrejected, not dissimilar proposals for a transitional Government; while Mr. Jihnah is likely to cause difficulty not only by claiming the right to nominateall the Moslem members, but by insistence on the prior acceptance of the principleof Pakistan.Discussion of the proposals, even if it should come to nothing, would havean unsettling effect on the present Council, as the history of the Cripps negotia-tions shows. Failure, too, would increase the sense of frustration and leave thesituation worse than before.On the other hand, should the proposals lead to the formation of a transitional Government, there are serious risks to face. Responsibility wouldbe handed over to new and untried men at a time when operations against Japanare likely to throw the greatest possible strain on the whole administration.The new Council, despite superficial agreement at the outset, would tend to internal division, the parties indulging in political manoeuvring, particularly with their friends in the Legislature. On certain external issues, however, theymay be expected to show a united front embarrassing to His Majesty&apos;s government -ment. This would certainly be the case in regard to the treatment of indians in the Dominions and Colonies, and might equally well be so in the sphere of middle East policy, e.g., in the event of a particular decision on the future ofPalestine. The new Council might well get out of hand in the course of ordinaryadministration so as to make the Governor-General&apos;s position impossible. Avery difficult situation, moreover, would be created if it should fail to agree onthe composition of the Constitution-making body. The Council also would bedefective in its inadequate representation of the not unimportant classes of indians who have loyally supported us in the past.The Viceroy, while admitting the force of these criticisms, contends thatthey are not decisive; risks must be taken in any case, and the risks arising from complete inaction are more serious than the foregoing.(Bef. No. v,pp. 10-12below.)
An A alternative Plan.An alternative suggestion has been made from here to the Viceroy to provide (Be/. No. 1%for a course of action which would largely avoid the foregoing difficulties. The pp, 9 &amp; 10suggestion is to leave the present Executive Council untouched for the duration below.)of the war and to announce the intention, in face of the unbridgeable gulf betweenthe leaders of the two main parties, to set up a conference composed primarilyof the other elements in the Indian polity, to discuss the basis of a future Constitu-tion and frame proposals. The present National Defence Council (a deliberativebody of about 30 members representative of the Provinces and States and ofvarious spheres of Indian life) would form a suitable nucleus, to be supplemented by further representation of the Depressed Classes and Labour, and by repre-sentatives of the fighting services. If it is impossible to by-pass Congress and the moslem League, they could be invited to participate, but on a relatively small scale. If they declined, the conference could go to work without them and ifsuccessful would help to undermine their claim to be the only political factorsthat count. Congress and the League would in any case be represented on thefinal constitution-making body which would be set up to consider the conclusionsof the conference and ratify, amend or reject them.The Viceroy characterises this plan as quite impracticable and says he (Be/. No. v,could not agree to implement it.   It is in any case impossible, he says, to by-pass Sw.)&apos; P&apos; 11both the main parties, who between them control the press and the electoralmachinery.   He says that academic discussion of the Constitution or the treaty would not strike the Indian imagination and would not be fruitful.   Sir JohnColville and Sir Maurice Hallett support his view.But Sir Bertrand Glancy, Governor of the Punjab, advocates the immediate (Be/. No. vn,summoning of a conference of all parties to consider the lines of post-war f^w.)&apos; P&apos; 12constitutional development; and a similar suggestion has been publicly advocatedin India by the leading Congress paper, the Hindustan Times, by one of themost experienced of Indian Dewans, Sir Mirza Ismail.On the 21st November the Viceroy telegraphed that the Standing Committee (Ref.of the Non-Party Conference (consisting mainly of the Indian Liberals) and p0-13v^eio&apos;w:,presided over by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru) had decided to set up a non-partyCommittee &quot; to examine the whole communal and minorities question from a constitutional and political point of view, putting itself in touch with differentparties and their leaders including minorities interested in the question and present a solution within two months.&quot; At a press conference Sapru said he hadGandhi&apos;s support.The Viceroy is making no move beyond giving reasonable assistance if itis asked for, but he considers that a move by His Majesty&apos;s Government will berequired when the Non-Party Committee reaches conclusions whether, positive   &apos;or negative.   He trusts that consideration of his proposals by the Cabinet will &apos;therefore not be delayed.B. Correspondence between the Viceroy and the Secretary of Statefor India.I.

I.Viceroy&apos;s Camp, India,My dear Amery, 20th September, 1944.I mentioned in a recent letter that I had had an informal discussion on thepolitical situation with the Provincial Governors at the conference at the endof August, and that they advised unanimously that some positive move shouldbe made by His Majesty&apos;s Government as soon as possible.2. I have considered this advice and discussed it with Auchinleck, Mudie,*Thornet and Wylie,!. who are all of the same opinion as the Governors and myself.As a result, I have drawn up the enclosed memorandum, which is intended for circulation to your colleagues, if you agree.3. I attach great importance to this matter, and am prepared to visit theUnited Kingdom in person to urge my view if necessary.4. I have kept the. memorandum as short as possible, but I hope that its general purport is clear. There are obviously many points of detail which would arise as the discussions progressed. The result of the present talks betweenGandhi and Jinnah may, of course, have considerable effect on the procedure tobe adopted and on the prospects of success.5. Paragraph 8 -the composition of any conference is obviously the chiefstumbling-block; I should want a free hand in this, as it would require a greatdeal of diplomacy to get together a body that would at once be recognised asrepresentative, would be reasonable, and would not consist entirely of political opponents of the Government.Yours ever,(Signed)       - WAVELL.The Right Hon. L. S. Amery, M.P.Note. This letter was written before the failure of the Gandhi-Jinnahconversations. The Viceroy has since telegraphed amendments to thememorandum which have been incorporated in the text below.Memorandum by the Viceroy.India is quiet now, and can be kept quiet until the Japanese war ends,though there is much bitterness amongst political Indians, who have no confidence in the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure political progress. Atthe end of the Japanese war we shall be faced immediately with demobilisation,the dispersal of labour from war factories, and the winding up of vast war-timeclerical establishments. All this will cause unemployment and discontent, since it will not be possible to divert war effort into peace-time channels at once. Wecan hope for no quick improvement in the food position and the other economictroubles caused by the war. Our political prisoners with some exceptions will have to be released, and will find explosive material ready to their hands.2. The Civil Services have been under a great strain and many senior officials will not have been home for eight years Or more. Many retirements willbe inevitable at the end of the war, and, however soon we restart recruitment, weshall be very short of experienced officials. The Indian Army, which will be under arms in great strength for a considerable time, will consist largely of young soldiers awaiting demobilisation. I have no reason whatever to doubt itsloyalty, but the transition from war to peace conditions must be unsettling. TheBritish troops will think only of getting home, and will resent intensely any delay due to internal disturbances or the fear of them.3. I am clear that the post-war period will be one of great difficulty, andeven danger, unless we can beforehand provide an outlet for the political andadministrative energy of the educated Indians, who would otherwise rangethemselves against us. We can provide this outlet only if we ,can make real progress with the political problem. I regard the chances of success asproblematical; and it may be that the British will be compelled to direct Indian* Home Member of the Government of India.f Secretary to the Governor-General (Public). s% Political Adviser to the Viceroy (for the Indian States).
affairs for a considerable time to come. But, should that happen, our task willbe far easier if Indian and world opinion are satisfied that we have made a genuine and determined attempt to secure a settlement. It is also mostimportant that His Majesty&apos;s Government should keep the initiative, andoriginate rather than be driven into a move.4. I asked the opinion of the eleven Provincial Governors at a Conferenceheld at the end of August. I pointed out that we might either adhere to thepresent policy of insisting on agreement between the Indian parties before making any further move, or make some positive move ourselves before the endof the Japanese war. The Governors advised me unanimously that a positivemove was essential, and that, in view of the rapidly approaching defeat ofGermany, it should be made as soon as possible. I have since ascertained thatthe Commander-in-Chief, my Home Member, and my Political Adviser agreewhole-heartedly with the Governors. This unanimity of those responsible forthe civil and military administration of India is striking, and cannot be disregarded by His Majesty&apos;s Government. I have good grounds to believe thatthe best and most experienced members of the I.C.S. are strongly in favour ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government making some fresh effort to implement their promisesto India, and that their morale may be affected by continuous inaction, lendingcolour to accusations of bad faith, which they regard as reflecting almost on their personal honour.The fact that Gandhi and Jinnah have had discussions and have failed hasdeepened the sense of frustration among Indians. At the same time it has probably made Nationalist opinion more ready than before to compromise. Itdoes not justify inaction on our part.5. His Majesty&apos;s Governments declared aim is to bring into operation anew Constitution for India and a Treaty between India and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. We can achieve this aim only if we can get together a represen-tative body of Indians capable of making a constitutional settlement which thecountry will accept, and of negotiating with His Majesty&apos;s Government. our immediate policy must therefore be directed to the establishment of such a body.6. I do not think there is any hope of success if we attempt to do too muchat once, or to solve the problem both of British India and of the Indian states in one move. I also reject the solution put forward by some of the Governors,that we should begin by holding General Elections in the Provinces and try to set up a Constituent Assembly on the.Cripps Offer model. Apart from thedifficulty of holding General Elections now, they would only intensify communalbitterness, and any Constituent Assembly formed as a result would be most unlikely to accomplish anything. We should also be forced to release political prisoners without any guarantee of a solution.7. I am convinced that our object should be to form as soon as possible a transitional Government at the Centre representative of the main political parties.   This Government would work within the present Constitution.*Its tasks would be (i) to carry on the Government of British India until the new constitution and Treaty come into force;(ii) to appoint the British India representative to the Peace Conferenceand other International Conferences;(iii) to consider the composition of the Constituent Assembly or other body which would draft the Constitution and negotiate the Treaty withHis Majesty&apos;s Government; and to secure the approval of the leadersof Indian opinion in the principal communities to the compositionproposed.No explanation of (i) is needed; obviously the Government must be pledged to support of the war effort, so long as the war lasts. I believe that (ii) wouldbe an attractive inducement to the political leaders.(iii) is proposed, in the light of the Draft Declaration of the 30th March,1942, under the terms of which His Majesty&apos;s Government were bound to acceptthe composition of the Constituent Assembly, provided it was either as proposedin the Declaration itself or such as was approved by the leaders of Indian opinion in the principal communities.* The only amendment in the Government of India Act, 1935, that would be needed wouldbe a small amendment of section 36 (iii) of the 9th Schedule to eliminate the condition thatthe Executive Council must include at least three persons who have been for at least ten years in the service of the Crown in India.
The association of the transitional Government with the Constitution-makingbody would add to its power and prestige and so make it more attractive to political leaders.8. In order to form such a transitional Government, I should try to assemblea small^j^onfei^enj^ of the principal leaders and certain others. My idea is to invite persons in whom the Congress, the Moslem League, the Depressed classes and the Sikhs, have confidence, and a few others, to the conference; and simul-taneously to broadcast an announcement of proposed plan in such terms as to impress public opinion both in India and abroad. If this is properly done theleaders would think twice before refusing.The selection of the persons to be invited is not easy. Provisionally I would include: Congress Gandhi and one other; Moslem League Jinnah and one other; Depressed Classes Ambedkar; Sikhs Tara Singh; Non-Congress Hindus Aney; Non-League Moslems Firoz Khan Noon (who is also an adequaterepresentative of the martial classes); and M. N. Roy as representative of Labour.I would tell Gandhi and Jinnah that they were at liberty to suggest thesecond representative of Congress and the League and to send substitutes for themselves if they were unwilling to attend.Within the limits of the policy approved by His Majesty&apos;s Government i must be allowed to make an announcement of the proposal in my own words.I would not bring the Princes in at the Conference stage, but would keep them informed of the result. I must keep my present Executive Council informedthroughout.9. The composition of the transitional Government would be a matter for negotiation. I would favour an equal number of Hindus and Moslems, with one representative of the Depressed Classes and one Sikh, in addition to theCommander-in-Chief and the Governor-General. It would be best to start witha smaller Council than at present.10.. * The Conference would have to consider also the best means of re-establishing popular Governments in the Section 93 Provinces in a temperateatmosphere. I would endeavour to persuade those attending to use their influence with their respective Parties to postpone General Elections both at the centre and in the Provinces until after the war, though it might be necessary to agreeto war-time elections. I would also endeavour to obtain Coalition Ministriesto hold office in the Section 93 Provinces during the transitional period.11. If the Conference agreed to the formation of a transitional Governmentand were able to propose acceptable members for it, they would be submitted byme for His Majesty&apos;s approval, through the Secretary of State, in the normal way. They would then take, office. Provincial Governments in Section 93Provinces would be formed simultaneously or as soon as possible afterwards.If it were found necessary or desirable to hold elections for Central and provincial legislatures, they would be held after the new Governments had taken office.12. After the new Government had taken office, I would at leisure encourageit to prepare and communicate to His Majesty&apos;s Government proposals for theestablishment of the Constitution and treaty-making body. At this stage the princes would have to. be brought into the negotiations.13. There are obvious difficulties and risks in the proposal. It is quitelikely that it may be impossible to reach agreement on the formation of a transitional Government. The members of the transitional Government mayunite to make the Governor-General&apos;s position impossible; they may fail toagree about the composition of the Constitution and treaty-making body; orthey may put forward proposals which His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept.But I am satisfied that the ultimate risks are much greater if we take no action; and that His Majesty&apos;s Government should make a determined efforttowards political progress in India as soon as possible. Even if we fail, weshall have made it clear that we wish to make progress. As already stated,my view has the support of all the principal and most responsible British officialsserving in India. The effect on world opinion is for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto judge.(Sgd.) WAVELL.New Delhi, September 1944.
III.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 5th October, 1944.No. 1821-S.   Top Secret.My r immediately preceding telegram. Following is outline of BroadcastAnnouncement.   Begins:1. His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined to implement their pledges toIndia and have authorised me to do everything possible to make progress towardsthat end.2. After the rejection of the Cripps offer His Majesty&apos;s Government had hoped that the leaders of Indian parties would get together and agree among themselves. Unfortunately the leaders of Congress and the Moslem League havebeen unable to reach an agreement on the communal issue. Let us approach thatissue rather more deliberately and try to make progress in other directions in themeantime.* Now incorporated in the memorandum.f This refers to a passage in the original memorandum (No. I) which was subsequentlyamended.$ Amended by para. 6 of No. VII below.Telegram from, Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 5th October, 1944.No. 1819-S.   Top Secret.My letter of 20th September. Political situation. Complete breakdown of gandhi-Jinnah talks does not alter appreciation in my memorandum. On thecontrary, it makes positive move by His Majesty&apos;s Government even more essential. But it would be useless now to attempt to discuss with Gandhi andJinnah as a preliminary to my proposed conference,! and in my plan of actionless emphasis than I originally intended must be placed on framing of proposalsfor Constitution-making body.2. I propose that I should invite selected leaders and one or two others toconference, without taking soundings of any kind, and simultaneously make a broadcast announcement of proposed plan. Object of broadcast is to bring ineducated opinion, which is sick of present stalemate and, whatever the result,would recognise that we are making effort ;to honour our pledges.3. I have in mind to invite Gandhi (Congress), Jinnah (Moslem League),Ambedkar (Depressed Classes), Tara Singh (Sikhs), Aney (Non-CongressHindus) and Firoz Khan Noon I (Non-League Moslems and an adequate represen-tative of fighting classes). Gandhi and Jinnah&apos; would be given option ofnominating substitutes if unwilling to attend themselves, and would be askedto bring one other representative of Congress and League with them. I wouldalso invite M. N. Roy to represent Labour. I should endeavour to start with a rather smaller council than at present, but actual numbers must be left for negotiation.5. My two immediately succeeding telegrams give respectively text of newparagraph No. 4A and revised paragraphs 8, 9 and 12 of memorandum^ andoutline of broadcast announcement.6. Revised paragraphs need no comment. Broadcast would have to be inmy own words, subject to His Majesty&apos;s Governments approval of generalpolicy. The main points are that announcement must be such &quot;as to makeeducated India sit up and leaders think twice before refusing; that it muststart with the assumption that in my transitional Government Hindus andMoslems must be equal; and must make it clear that as soon as an advance is practicable His Majesty&apos;s Government will go ahead. On the last point my views are that it might be possible to go ahead with Congress or Moslem Leaguestanding out. It would not be possible to do so if both stood out. The belief thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to by-pass one of the major parties ifthey can do so would be salutary.7. I should have to inform Council of plan immediately before announce-ment is made and thereafter keep them informed.8. I should like to be free to judge the timing myself. I originally thought the end of the German war would be best moment. I now think early action necessary, perhaps almost immediately.
3. India has great problems before her which can be solved to India&apos;s satis-faction only by the leading men of all parties. I propose to try to form a transitional Government at the Centre, representative of the main political parties with the following tasks : (a) To prosecute the war against Japan with the utmost energy, to prepare for post-war development, and to carry on the government of british india until the new Constitution and treaty can be worked out.(b) To appoint the British India representatives to the peace conferencewhen the time comes and to other International conferences.(c) To consider if and when the members of the Government think this possible, the composition of the body which would draft theConstitution and negotiate the treaty with His Majesty&apos;s Government.4. The transitional Government must work within the framework of thepresent Constitution. There can be no question of a convention under which theGovernor-General agrees not to exercise his constitutional right of veto. But itwill not be unreasonably exercised. Except for the Governor-General and theCommander-in-Chief the transitional Government would be entirely Indian. Ipropose that there should be an equal number of places for Hindus and Moslems,with one representative each of the depressed classes and the Sikhs. I wouldselect the members in consultation with the leaders of the political parties pre-pared to participate and would submit their names to the Secretary of State forthe King Emperor&apos;s approval.5. With a view to advising me on the general political situation and on thepossibility of forming such a Government the following have been invited to aconference at Viceroy&apos;s house (enter names).6. &apos; If the meeting is successful I hope that the political leaders will agreenot only on a transitional Government at the Centre but on the formation ofcoalition Governments in the Section 93 Provinces.7. I realise that this plan does not meet the demands of some Indian leadersfor immediate independence and full power, but it&quot; seems to me the best and in theend the quickest way to real progress, and I think India would be well-advised toaccept it.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government are most reluctant to allow disagreement between parties to hold up progress indefinitely, and if I am satisfied that I canform a transitional Government that is likely to produce results without thesupport of all parties I shall do so.9. If the conference fails we can only carry on as at present with thepresent Executive Council, which is doing most valuable work for India.   Ends.IV.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 10th October, 1944.22607.   Top Secret.Your telegrams of the 5th October, 1819-21-S. I have studied yourmemorandum in the light of these telegrams. I feel I must draw your attentionto certain questions and criticisms which my colleagues would be sure to raise.I hope you will not think that the mention of them indicates any lack of sympathy with your main purpose the case for which is put cogently in your first threeparagraphs. I also offer for your consideration a counter suggestion which seems to me to avoid some of the difficulties that I see in your plan.2. While agreeing that if any move is to be made by us it should be madesoon, the question of timing has special importance for the particular solutionyou contemplate. Are you satisfied that if your proposals secured Indianagreement the near future would be a suitable time to put them into operation ?Important operations based on India, which will strain India&apos;s transport and internal economy to the limit, are impending in 1945 and are likely to continueinto 1946. In the first place, would not your present Executive Council bedistracted by political developments from their primary duties (cf. last sentence of Prime Ministers directive)? You will remeuber the shock to their izzat- and to their own self-confidence resulting from the 1942 proposals and I feel that even suggesting your scheme to them would have a depressing and unsettling effect.In the second place, if the conference produced rapid results, would you beprepared while such military conditions continued to hand over the responsibilities
of Government to a completely new and untried team, only superficially inagreement at the outset and thereafter mainly occupied with politicalmanoeuvring ?: 3. I question greatly whether your proposals would be accepted by theprincipal parties. You propose that the transitional Government would work within the present Constitution. It is therefore essentially on the lines of the short-term proposals made by Cripps and it is doubtful whether even withthe additional tasks assigned te&apos; it in your paragraph 7 Congress would be moreready to participate than in 1942. Gandhi certainly shows no sign of suchreadiness. Admittedly your plan preserves present chain of responsibility toParliament and can be defended as retaining existing system of control in defence matters. But what I would fear is that once negotiations opened you would be exposed to great pressure to whittle down this control to a furtherextent than His Majesty&apos;s Government could at present contemplate. On theother hand, could Jinnah now look at any plan which commits him to an undividedIndia with no assurance of Pakistan and with Congress inside the Government ?Would not the almost certain failure of negotiations for which we would thenbe held responsible increase the sense of frustration in India and leave thesituation worse than before ?4. But even assuming a transitional Government were set up on the linesyou propose with the Governor-General&apos;s overriding power retained I foreseegrave difficulties. There would be a very real risk of it getting out of handover problems arising in the course of administration and making your positionimpossible (cf. paragraph 13 of your memorandum). How would you proposeto deal with such a situation ? And what if the transitional Government failed Ato&apos; agree about the constitution-making body? Would it be feasible, havingregard to the composition of such a Government, for His Majesty&apos;s Government Ito impose a decision on it in that regard? Would it, in fact, be. possible tokeep it in office if in this respect it failed in what I think you would regard as its chief purpose ?5.   I doubt indeed if a Government composed as you propose is inherentlycapable of survival even if it could initially be got -together.   Its relationswith the legislature are likely to be fruitful in intrigue.   If one section of it,e.g., Congress, failed to secure approval of its proposals in Council would it notbe tempted to whip up support from its followers in the legislature to the extentof refusing supply or otherwise making the transaction of Government businessimpossible?   The unity of your p&quot;resent -Council is surely largely due to the factthat its members have no outside organised allegiances to placate and no outsideaxes to grind.   I see every probability of your transitional Government becoming a house divided against itself and unable to present an undivided front to thelegislafeure^f^Yoiil^pan is, of course, essentially different from the offer of 1942as it postulates no prior general agreement between the political leaders about jthe constitutional future.  Without such agreement which seems as far off as ever, j there are bound, I think, to be acute tensions within the Council and much!manoeuvring for future position. &apos; -6. You do not mention an awkward difficulty which I foresee in the .composition of the transitional Government. You propose an equal number ofHindus and Moslems. Would JinnaJh be allowed to nominate all the Moslems?If not, he would very probably refuse to co-operate. If he were allowed this power some of the soundest and not least important sections of the Moslems inthe Punjab and elsewhere would go unrepresented. Indeed, a weighty criticism of your proposals generally is their apparent aim of conciliating principally theCongress Party and the Moslem League, despite the wholly inadequate repre-sentation they provide for the not insignificant classes in India, who havesupported us loyally in the past, who have co-operated whole-heartedly in the war effort, both by service in the armed forces and otherwise, and whose co-operation is still essential.7. A problem which will no doubt be forced on us. sooner or later, but is bound to arise under your proposals in an acute form, is the continued detention of the Congress Working Committee. Pressure for their release is certain to bevery strong. Is it part of your proposals that they should be released, and if soat what stage and on what terms ?8. I fully appreciate the arguments against allowing the situation to driftand in favour of our taking the initiative. Is there any alternative plan which,while escaping these objections for the most part, would show that we are notcontent to sit still ? I think there is. I suggest that, for the duration of the waryou should leave the present Executive Council untouched after all, it is a very
representative cross-section of Indian opinion outside the ranks of Congress andthe League and give it the assurance that you and His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthere are behind them in doing their best for India and for the common cause.At the same time you would announce your intention, in face -of the obviouslyunbridgeable gulf between the leaders of the two main organised parties (andthe indications of trouble in other political quarters, e.g., Mahasabha and Sikhsif they had &quot;agreed), to -set up yourself a conference composed primarily of theother less unbalanced and irreconcilable&quot;elements&apos;in the Indian polity for thepurpose of discussing the basis of a future Constitution for India and framingproposals therefor. I suggest that in the National Defence Council you have a body which would form a very suitable nucleus for such a conference, not leastbecause it already contains representatives of the Princes. Additions might bemade to it to include the Premiers of the non-Section 93 Provinces, elderstatesmen, further representatives of Labour and the Depressed Classes, and not least representatives of the Lighting Services, including those of the States.Even so, it would not be unduly large for general discussion, but might be guided to select from within itself a committee to concentrate on planning. the selection of a chairman would be a critical point of the scheme, as it would beof your proposed conference, but should not be insuperably difficult. For thevery reasons given above there is much to be said for by-passing entirely bothCongress and the League as such. If that is considered impossible they might beinvited to participate, but only on a relatively small scale and certainly not asa majority between them of the British Indian representatives : if they declined,the conference would go to work without them, and if successful would go a longway to undermine their claim to be the only political factors that count. Theconference could, I assume, have secretarial and expert assistance from yourReforms Department and might well be guided to call in the help of advisers,especially those experienced in the working of federal constitutions, from theDominions and foreign countries. Proposals emanating from the conference would no&apos;doubt be subject to eventual ratification by some elected body, and itwould be part of the functions of the conference to consider and recommend themanner in which that body should be set up. Congress and the League would inevitably be represented on the elected ratifying body, and this would provide an answer to criticism of their exclusion from, or non-participation in, the workof the Conference, and strengthens the case for their deliberate exclusion fromthe outset.9. It seems to me that this plan would avoid during the critical war period the really serious administrative difficulties inherent in your proposals : it wouldbe an earnest of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s determination to fulfil theirpromises : it would focus Indian political discussion on a constructive task : itevades the difficulty which is a feature both of your preliminary conference and your transitional Government of having the two principal communal partiesconfronting each other and dominating the discussions with their irreconcilabledifferences, and it would give full opportunity for the expression of the views ofthose w-ho have stood by us in recent years. I look forward with much interestto your views on this suggestion as well as to your comments on the points madeearlier in this telegram.V.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 22nd October, 1944.1949-S.   Top Secret.Your 22607.1. I had naturally taken into full consideration the objections you urgebefore I submitted my proposal. There are risks to the course I have recommended, but it is quite impossible to make progress towards political settlement without taking risks. I will deal briefly with your&apos; apprehensions,which are those I foresaw.2. Undoubtedly there is risk that an Executive Council composed ofpoliticians might obstruct war effort. I do not believe they would do so activelyor maliciously, but they might hinder it by putting forward social or economicprojects incompatible with whole-time prosecution of war. I should have tosatisfy myself before forming Government that there was genuine intention fully to support war effort. Commander-in-Chief was entirely in agreement with-my proposal and was not apprehensive of effect on war effort.
3. Attempts might be made to sabotage Government by new Council after it was formed. It might intrigue with Legislature. It might break up overcomposition of constitution-making body. These are risks which have to be faced.I would not propose to commit His Majesty&apos;s Government or myself to dealingwith body of irresponsible politicians, and would not submit names for HisMajesty&apos;s approval unless I felt they would act reasonably in furtherance of war effort and India&apos;s interests. If Government did break down, I should hope tore-form Council on present model.4. Attempt to form new Government would upset present Executive Council.This is possible, but again it has to be faced. Council have always been aware that attempt to form political Government is possibility and hold office on theunderstanding that Governor-General may ask for their resignations at any time.One Member at least has lately urged me in private letter to attempt to formpolitical Government. Inadequacy of present Council in handling matters of long-term importance, such as sterling balances and post-war reconstruction, is,I believe, recognised by all Members. Also you must not forget that enlargementand Indianisation of Executive Council involved certain risks which increase as time goes on. It is not easy now for Governor-General or Secretary of state to overrule Council, and we have, in fact, transferred to Indian hands considerablepower without corresponding responsibility. It is wrong to assume that presentconditions are entirely safe and satisfactory.5. Proposed conference would fail and would leave us in worse position.This would depend on wording of announcement and handling of conference.If His Majesty&apos;s Government insisted on an unfriendly or discourteous approachwe Should, I agree, only make matters worse. But if I were permitted to dealwith parties so as to convince them and the public that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentreally want a solution, there would be reasonable chance of success and I do notthink failure would worsen the position.6. You objected that my proposal does not require preliminary agreementbetween leaders on constitutional future. It is because such an agreement ismanifestly impossible that I have made my proposal, which is based on belief that only by period of working together on India&apos;s common problems is there any hope that politicians may arrive at solution of communal problem. It is hopedthat realisation of In.dia&apos;s problems and their power to help in their solution willhave sobering effect on &quot;those who, without responsibility, put forward wildschemes. This has commonly happened in practically all countries and did soto a large extent when Congress took office in 1937.7. You say Jinnah would demand that all Moslem members of transitionalGovernment should be nominated by him. This would be a matter for negotiation.Actually, owing to shortage of talent in the League Jinnah might nominate oneor more of such as Firoz Khan Noon or Azizul Haque or one of present Moslempremiers.8. Genuine attempt at solution on my lines might involve release of Working-Committee at any time. I would resist release until (a) it appeared that parties would support war effort, and (b) conference looked like succeeding. If Gandhiwished to nominate one of the Committee as a member of the conference it wouldbe necessary to release him.9. I am afraid that I regard your alternative as quite impracticable. Itwould get us nowhere and I could not agree to implement it. However much His Majesty^S^GTovernment may dislike Congress and the Moslem League and their leaders, Gandhi and Jinnah, they hold keys of situation and cannot be by-passed.They would control any elections held, they control the press, and Congress hasfinancial support from nearly all the wealthy men of India. During the last yearI have sought earnestly for any signs of any party or any attempt to form onewhich would have slightest chance of success beside Congress, but am convincedthat there is none and no prospect at present of one coming into being.10. I think above deals with your main points. There is much force in them, but risks will have to be taken if we are to avoid serious disaster in thiscountry at the end of the war. It is not my opinion alone, but that of Commander-in-Chief, Home Member and all the eleven Governors, that an early move isnecessary. This constitutes weight of opinion that His MajestyGovernmentcan hardly ignore. If we remain passive we may very probably be faced by freshmove by political parties, which may prove embarrassing and lose us initiative.Home Member agrees to principle of move, but thinks I should simply holdconference to consider measures necessary to enable leaders of political partiesto participate in administration and a start to be made with constitutional plan.[28681] D
I regard direct attempt at communal solution which conference of this kind might involve as quite impracticable, especially in the light of recent events. Academicdiscussion of constitution or treaty would not strike Indian imagination andwould not be fruitful. Proposal I have put forward seems to me best prospectof solving deadlock, and to have sufficient chance of success to demonstrate oursincerity.11. Please take no action.to place before Cabinet until I write or telegraphagain.*VI.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 24th October, 1944.23891.   Top Secret.Your 1949-S of 22nd October.1.   I will await your further communication and take no action meanwhile.2. I venture to suggest, however, that, unless you have done so already, you should consider consulting some of your leading Governors on your actual pro-posals. I have particularly in mind Hallett, Twynam, and Colville, and alsoGlancy, in view of crucial position of Punjab in the constitutional issue and.inthe war effort. I gather that, while Governors at the recent Conference were infavour of a move, you have not taken their views on your concrete proposal or onthe alternative I have propounded. Your predecessors, in making large proposalsof this sort, have usually made known to His Majesty&apos;s Government the viewsof the leading Governors. Even if some of them may differ from your proposalthey may have useful suggestions as regards details. The Cabinet will, I think,want to know what the views of the principal Governors are and I should also liketo know their reaction to my alternative proposal.VII.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 2%th October, 1944.2004-S.   Top Secret,Political situation. I am generally aware of the views of all the Governors,as something very like my plan was one of the possibilities discussed at the governors&apos; Conference.2. I have now consulted Colville and Hallett myself here, and Glancy&apos; through my Deputy Private Secretary, whom I sent tc Lahore for the purpose.All three Governors have read my memorandum for the Cabinet and the telegrams.Colville and Hallett have also seen my letters of 24th October to the PrimeMinister and yourself.3. Colville and Hallett are entirely in favour of my plan. They considerthat the failure of the Gandhi-Jinnah talks has produced an atmosphere favour-able to a move by His Majesty&apos;s Government; that the present is a suitable timebecause our war position is sound, food situation is relatively secure, and some progress has been made with the planning of post-war development; that thewar effort, food administration and development programme would not be seriously affected by political Government at the centre and coalitions in theProvinces, though there would be some loss of efficiency; and that even if theplan failed we should get the credit of having made a sincere attempt. Theydo not accept your alternative solution. They think it impossible to by-passCongress and the League and a conference-of the kind you suggest would be ineffective and would be regarded by Indians as an example of British insincerity.Like myself they do not put the chances of success for my plan very high, butthink risk of failure worth taking. They do not think failure would worsenpolitical situation.4. Glancy is mainly concerned with the stability of the Unionist party and ministry. He does not like my plan on the ground that it would immediatelygive the Moslem League a commanding position and make Khizar&apos;s positiondifficult if not hopeless. He believes Pakistan in its crude form to be a very grave danger, and thinks we should clo all we can to prevent it.   On the other* This took the form of a personal letter to the Prime Minister which was received On the5th November.
hand, he favours an immediate move which should take the form of a conference to which all recognised political bodies of any importance should be invited tosend representatives.   Object of the conference would be &quot; to p^xuaound a scheme &apos;for-the.....fulfilment- of--Sis.-Majesty&apos;s Governments pledges in the matter of constitutional development at the earliest &quot;possible -moment after the conclusionof the war.&quot; Congress and the League would be included, and Glancy agrees with Colville and Hallett that it is impossible to by-pass them or to build on national Defence Council as you suggest. I can meet Glancy&apos;s main objectionto my plan to some extent by including Khizar in place of Firoz Khan Noon. Iwas advised not to include Khizar, as his presence might make Jinnah refusemy invitation. But I am prepared to risk this, and I admit that Firoz, though in many ways suitable, might not be trusted by the Unionist party. I do not likeGlancy&apos;s plan. It means an immediate attempt to solve communal problem whichI think impossible at present and have tried to avoid.5. I have not again consulted Twynam as I know that he favours general elections immediately after the end of the German war, followed by attempt toestablish Constitution-making body on Cripps model. Casey takes a similarview, and would add a time schedule giving dates of various stages by whichwe would transfer power to Indian bands. Scheme on these lines seems to mereally dangerous. General Elections fought on &quot; quit India&quot; and communalissues without any preliminary undertaking of any kind would certainly interferewith the war effort and internal administration.6.   Commander-in-Chief agrees with me throughout and is not apprehensiveabout effect on the war effort.VIII.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated 21st November, 1944.2132-S.Political situation. Reuters have telegraphed text of resolution of&quot;Standing Gommittee of Non-Party Conference published on 19th and carried bymorning papers on 20th November. Resolution sets up Committee &quot; to examinethe whole communal and minorities question from a constitutional and political point of view, putting itself in touch with different parties and their leaders,including minorities, interested in the question, and present a solution within twomonths to Standing Committee.&quot; It further authorises Sapru to appointmembers of the Committee and announce their names.2.   At Press Conference on 19th Sapru stated or implied (a) that Gandhi was originally in favour of a representative all-PartiesConference;(b) that Sapru himself was against this;(c) that proposed Committee is to consist of people who are not activelyassociated with any of the recognised political parties and have notpublicly expressed opinions on the controversy;(d) that Committee object will be to &quot;lift discussion of communal andpolitical problem from partisan level to scientific and judicial level &quot;;(e) that he hoped two ex-High Court judges, and possibly one or twoEuropeans, would serve;(/) that Committee will do all it can to ascertain views of the&apos; various parties;(g) that there will be no recriminations if any party declines to co-operate,though the fact will be recorded; and(h) that the Committee&apos;s report will be published.Sapru said that he had Gandhi&apos;s support. He. hoped Government would&quot; adopt a reasonable attitude to any approach by Committee for information orstatistics.&quot; He thought release of Working Committee most desirable, but didnot make it a condition.3. Sapru has not yet selected his members. Gwyer, B. N. Rao, MirzaIsmail and Maharaj Singh are among those mentioned, but composition is notyet settled. Until names are announced and Committee begin work it will notbe possible to estimate chances of success. At present they seem small. Committeecannot avoid direct attack on communal problem. Jinnah will probably sayMoslem League&apos;s position is perfectly clear and needs no further explanation.
He will also point out that this is another move by Gandhi, who is always trying to by-pass either His Majesty&apos;s Government or League and hopes this time towork up publicity against and possibly- split League. With one or two exceptions,e.g., B. INT. Rao, Indian members of the Committee are not likely to carry much-weight.-. I have a poor opinion of Sapru, who is bitter and intolerant.4. I am therefore making no move here at present. In reply to short-notice question in the Council of State to-day, we are saying Government will consider sympathetically any request by Committee for assistance. I will see that all reasonable assistance is given, but do not intend to make offers or suggestions.If Sapru asks to see me I will see him, but shall not invite him. I am told Sapru.does not expect more than this, and active intervention would only hardenLeague opposition and make the Committee&apos;s task more difficult.5. Gandhi has for the moment regained the initiative through Sapru.But a move by His Majesty&apos;s Government will be needed either when theCommittee fails, as it probably will, or when its report is published. Our movemust certainly hot be timed so as to give the impression that we are frustratingsincere attempt at settlement by Indian leaders, and delay of anything up to twoor three months may be necessary. But I earnestly trust consideration of my proposals on general lines by the Cabinet will not be postponed. The problem is most complex and we must be ready to move fast when the time comes. unless we are agreed on principles we shall again miss the psychological moment andlose the initiative.
