The first cross-channel train ferry was received at Calais on the 21st.Mediterranean.Gulf of Genoa.7. On the 16th enemy positions on the Franco-Italian frontier were shelledby the French destroyer L&apos;A Icy on, and the next day the French cruiser GeorgesLeygues successfully bombarded a barracks, an observation post and a bridge inthe same area.   On the 20th the French cruiser Montcalm bombarded San Remo.On the night of the 18th/19th coastal forces sank an enemy ship in convoyin the Gulf of Genoa and on the following night they torpedoed two coasters in convoy and probably sank two lighters.On the night of the 9th /10th partisans blew up an 8,000-ton motorshipand two ammunition barges at Spezia.Adriatic.8.

three junks and two schooners, from which four prisoners were taken. On the10th Trenchant sank a junk by gunfire, and on the 12th Spirit probably sank asmall tanker.Pacific.Philippines.11. From sighting reports received during the week it is believed that the effective battleships and cruisers of the Japanese main fleet are still in thePhilippine area, and it is possible that only damaged ships have returned to japan.On the 16th U.S. coastal craft in Ormoc Bay sank two Japanese M.T.B.Sand five barges, two of which were carrying troops.Dutch New Guinea.12. On the 14th Allied forces landed with only slight opposition on Pegunand Bras Islands (Mapia group) N. of the western end of-New Guinea. medium bombers attacked Pegun on the previous day.

Mines have been laid by surface craft in Home Waters and by aircraft in the Skagerrak.   Mines have also been laid in the Gulf of Martaban.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Mines weeping.20. There have been no reports of minelaying by enemy aircraft in home waters, but it is suspected that some mines were laid off Walcheren on the 21st.E-boats probably laid mines off the Humber on the night of the 15th/16th, where12 mines have been destroyed. On the same night our coastal forces engagedE-boats which were attempting to lay mines in the mouth of the Scheldt. During[28679] . b
the week 17 mines have been destroyed in the approach channel to Flushing and four at Antwerp, making a total of 241 destroyed in this area. Sweeping offHavre has been held up by gales. A tank landing ship was damaged in theSeine on the 17th and a U.S. minesweeper was damaged at Brest on the 19th.21.

(An outline map is included as an inset.)General.22.   There have been notable advances in all sectors of the Allied front.In the south, French troops have advanced up to 40 miles and have capturedBelfort and entered Mulhouse. Further north, French and U.S. troops haveliberated Saarebourg and swung east towards Strasbourg.The Third U.S. Army has advanced along its entire front. Metz has beenliberated, except for isolated resistance in some of the forts surrounding thetown. U.S. forces from the Thionville bridgehead have swept along the eastbank of the Moselle, and, to the north, are fighting on and over the german frontier.After very severe fighting east of Aachen, the First and Ninth U.S. Armieshave gained some ground towards the Roer. Troops of the Ninth U.S. Army arenow within two miles of the River at Julich.The Second British Army has eliminated about half of the Meuse pocket, andis within 2-^ miles of Venlo.   .Southern Group of Armies.23. At the beginning of this period, the French troops who, on the 14th, hadopened their attack from a point 20 miles S.W. of Belfort, w^ere advancingsteadily up the valley of the Doubs. The pace of the advance was now accelerated,and Montbeliard, 10 miles south of Belfort, was liberated on the 17th. On thefollowing day, French troops were engaged in bitter fighting on the outskirts ofBeifort, and finally entered the town on the morning of the 20th. At the sametime, armoured and infantry. columns reached the Rhine, and the german frontier, between Basle and Mulhouse. During this period, the enemy&apos;s retreatwas largely disorganised and many prisoners were taken.French troops have now entered Mulhouse; they have also advanced 5 milesbeyond Belfort and are clearing up the enemy pocket remaining west of thattown. The French reached Gerardmer on the 21st, while U.S. forces on theirleft have made limited advances along the whole front between Gerardmer andRaon D&apos;Etape, 25 miles further north.East of Luneyille, strong U.S. and French forces opened an attack on the 19th,and within 24 hours had advanced 15 miles to the outskirts of Saarebourg. since then they have liberated Saarebourg and are exploiting to the S.E. towardsStrasbourg, to the north, and to the N.W. to close the enemy pocket createdon their left flank. Latest reports indicate that an Allied column has reachedSaverne, within 25 miles of Strasbourg.Central Group of A armies.24. North of Dieuze U.S. forces have advanced steadily on a 20-mile front.On the right flank of this advance, armoured columns are now moving towardsFenetaang, which is also threatened by the Allied advance from Saarebourg. Onthe left they are moving towards St. Avoid, 4 miles from the German frontier.South of Metz, U.S. forces have advanced towards Metz on a wide front, andon the 19th November cut the main road east to St. Avoid at a point 7 milesfrom Metz, The enemy pocket west of Metz and of the Moselle has beeneiiruinated, after heavy fighting, and the city was entered on the 18th and QPthe next day columns from the north and the south joined hands jn the city.By this time troops, who had made a striking advance from the Thionyille bridge-head, cut the last main road from Metz to the east. Mopping up continues incertain parts of the city and of the neighbouring forts. In the Tbionvijle bridge-head, the arrival of strong armoured units east of the Moselle made possible the
most rapid exploitation south towards Metz, and east to the German frontier.These armoured units are now established on and across the frontier on a very wide front in the area N.W. of Saarlautern.After very heavy air bombardment of enemy positions and forward coin-munications, the First and Ninth U.S. Armies opened a major attack east ofAachen on the 16th. Fighting has been severe throughout this sector, the enemycounter-attacking strongly and making full use of his fixed defences, often inheavily wooded country. On the 19th, the enemy pocket west of Eschweiler waseliminated, and on the following day U.S. troops entered the town, where moppingup continues. South of this area there has been little progress. West of Julich,U.S. forces have been advancing slowly and steadily towards the Roer on a.10-mile front.  They are now within 2 miles of the river at Julich.Northern Group of Armies.25. On the left flank of the Ninth U,S. Army, Allied troops under british command captured Geilenkirchen on the 18th, and after mopping up in the townare advancing N.E. towards the Roer. Here, too, fighting has been severe and progress slow.&apos; In the Meuse pocket south and west of Venlo, British troops have gainedthe line of the Meuse on a 20-mile front, and are now 2\ miles south of Venloon the west bank of the river. The indifferent roads, boggy country, and largenumbers of enemy mines are still the major factors limiting the rate of ourprogress in this sector.East of Nijmegen, and along the south bank of the Maas, the enemy has proved particularly sensitive to the activities of our patrols.Italy.26. Early in the Week, the Germans blew the banks of the River Montonenbar its mouth, thereby causing further large floods south of Ravenna. despite this; our armoured cars aiid tanks have moved forward Until they ate iiow in aposition to engage the enemy&apos;s defences on the lower Montone. Less than 2 milesnow separates our forward trOops from the outskirts of Ravenna.On either side Of Highway 9, progress was negligible until the night20th/21st, when the divisions to the north and south of the road both put in anattack aimed at securing a crossing over the River Cosina, the next water obstacleblocking our advance to Faenza. The divisoii to the north of the road succeeded in getting some troops across the river, but heavy enemy counter attacks, supportedby tanks, forced their eventual withdrawal. South of Highway 9, there was strong and determined enemy resistance, and, so far, our forces have reached theriver only in one small sector. We are still 4 miles, at our nearest point, fromFaenza.The only territorial change in Fifth Army has been the capture of Modiglianaon the 16th, when Indian forces operating on the extreme right flankcO-operated With troops under the command of Polish Corps in EighthArray in securing this important village. Elsewhere the process of resting andre-grouping, Which has been going on for some time, continues.The Eastern European Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Finland..27. The Germans continued their withdrawal in Northern Finland and north Norway.Northern Sector.28. Since the Russians overran the greater part of Oesel Island in thefirst half of October, the Germans have been clinging to the peninsula at itssouthern tip. A fresh Russian attack has now forced the -German garrison to yield part of the peninsula, and only a very small bridgehead remains in their hands.During the greater part of the week the Tukums-Libau sector was relativelyquiet, but the Germans reported a very large-scale Russian attack oti the 20thm the a,rea S.E.- of Libau, claiming that it had been repulsed.   No confirmation of heavy fightilig ori this part of the front has come from the Russians[28679] 3 2
Southern Sector.29. The Russians made progress in the area east and N.E. of Budapest,where they captured Fuzesabony and are now well across the railway joiningMiskolc with Budapest.Russian attacks have also been reported from the area west of Sombor,where the Russians hold a bridgehead on the west bank of the Danube.Yugoslavia.30. In Southern Yugoslavia, Bulgarian and Yugoslav troops capturedSkolpje on the 15th, and the Bulgarians have also occupied Mitrovica andPristina. The Germans are continuing their withdrawal through CentralYugoslavia, and have opened up a new escape route through the R, Drinavalley : apart from being considerably hampered upon this route as upon othersby Partisan action, the enemy are also facing bridging difficulties on the Drina.Nearer the coast the evacuation of the important communication centre of Kninstarted on the 18th.A albania.31. In Albania, Partisan forces have captured Elbasan, Durazzo andTirano. Fierce fighting is continuing on the Tirana-Scutari road : here and elsewhere in the country the enemy have already suffered considerable casualties.German columns which had reached the Podgorica area have met strong Partisanresistance, and have made no northward progress.Burma.32. On the 16th November our troops occupied Kalemyo. Progress hasbeen made in advances southwards down the Mytttha Valley and eastwardstowards Kalewa. Other troops, advancing southwards on both sides of the chindwin, are on the outskirts of Masein, a village 12 miles north of Kalewa.In Northern Burma, Chinese troops are investing Bhamo and fighting isin progress on the south-western outskirts. Chinese forces have cut the Bhamo-Namhkam Road and the Bhamo-Mong Mit Road, seven miles S.S.E. and 25 miles.S.W. of Bhamo respectively. Leading elements of these troops south of Bhamohave reached the village of Sikaw.Troops of the Chinese Expeditionary Force from Yunnan occupied the village of Mangshih on about the 20th. They are at present attacking the village of Chefang.China.33. Japanese forces, driving down the Hengyang-Kweilin-Liuchow-Railway, must now be assumed to have made contact with those in the West Riverregion. After capturing Liuchow, Japanese columns began to advance north-westwards. Ishan fell on the 15th and leading elements are already atChinchenchiang, some 40 miles further west. To the south other Japanese forces are reported in Pinyang, about 40 miles N.E. of Naning, On the main Liuchow-Naning highway.Philippines.34. The Japanese defenders of Leyte, who have recently been reinforced,are bitterly contesting every inch of the U.S. advance. During the week fightinghas centred in the area around Limon and on the mountain ridge to the S.E. ofLimon. The U.S. troops now control the forward slopes of these mountains.Japanese resistance at Dagami continues. Troops from the Baybay area repelledan attempted Japanese landing on the west coast, 14 miles N.E. of Baybay, and thereafter advanced further up the coast to a village 1 mile north of Albuera.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.35. Fighter Command flew 61 defensive sorties against flying bombs; oneHe. Ill launching aircraft was destroyed. Details of enemy activity against thiscountry are reported under &quot; Enemy Activity and Home Security.&quot;
Home Waters.36. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 561 sorties on anti-submarine missions; two aircraft are missing.Enemy shipping was attacked off the Norwegian coast, and Hali faxes set on fire two 3,000-ton vessels off the Skaw; R:P. Beaufighters left in. flames foursmall vessels off the Dutch islands.Bomber Command laid 287 sea-mines.Western Europe.37. In the week ended dawn on the 22nd, aircraft of S-.H.A.E.F.

In the week ended dawn on the.23rd, Bomber Command and U.S. VIII Bomber Command flew 4,903 sorties by day and 2,213 by night and dropped 15,371 tons, while Fighter Command andIIS. VIII Fighter Command flew 3,552 sorties. One hundred and forty enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and a further 90 on the ground; 240 allied aircraft failed to return.Generally unpropitious weather continued, resulting in nearly all the bombing attacks being made through cloud.With the reopening of the offensive on the Western Front the heavies attackedobjectives in the rear of the enemy lines;-oil installations were the prioritystrategic targets and were attacked systematically.Heavy bombers opened - the week on the 16th with attacks on Duren(2,700 tons), Julich (1,900 tons) and Heinsberg (1,000 tons); clear weather was encountered over the two first named, the bombing was very accurate and thesetowns were virtually destroyed. On the same day a large force of UJ3. bombersdropped 3,700 tons of fragmentation bombs on enemy fortified positions through-out the Eschweiler/Duren area.Railway and communication targets included Minister (1,900 in two attacks), Aschaffenburg (1,400 tons), Osnabruck (400 tons), Coblenz (300 tons);in all instances results were unobserved. Cloud with base at 4,000 feet was encountered in attacks by Lancasters on the Dortmund-Ems Canal at Ladbergenand the Mittelland Canal at Gravenhorst; the aircraft were instructed by the master bomber to attack below cloud, and approximately 600 tons were releasedwith accuracy on each target.The bomb tonnage on oil installation amounted to over 6,000 tons. A con-centrated attack on Wanne-Eickel (1,500 tons) took place on the night 18th/19th,which subsequent photographs show resulted in severe damage to importantelements of the plant. Homberg (Meerbeck) wras the target for Lancasters by day on two occasions; weather conditions were adverse on the 20th, but on thefollowing day a clear patch was found over the target and 800 tons were released, resulting in a huge sheet of yellow flame and much smoke up to10,000 feet. Good visibility was also encountered on the night 21st/22nd when950 tons were dropped on Castrop/Rauxel and 850 tons on Sterkrade (Holten);both attacks produced large fires and explosions. Buer, Merseburg, Harburg and hamburg also each received substantial tonnages with unobserved results.No strong enemy opposition was encountered in any of the above attacks,except on the 21st, when U.S. heavies in the course of their operations overN.W. Germany sighted some 350/400 enemy aircraft, including a concentration of 150 in the area of Merseburg; 72 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combatand six on the ground, whilst 40 heavies and 16 of the escorting fighters were reported to be missing.A force of 171 Lancasters was despatched against Trondheim; the target area was, however, so successfully screened by smoke that the attack had to be abandoned.   Three aircraft are missing.Harassing raids by Mosquitos included three on Hanover, and one each onWiesbaden, Stuttgart, Worms, and two oil plants.Medium bombers flew over 1,500 sorties against defended localities, supplydepots, lines of communications and other enemy objectives both by day and by night throughout the entire length of the battle front. Operations in support ofour ground forces by strong formations of fighters and fighter-bombers continued,in the course of which about 300 locomotives, 1,300 units of rolling-stock, 800 M.T.vehicles, 40 A.F.V., and 70 gun positions were destroyed, while railway tracksare reported to have been cut in 160 places; many other similar targets and anumber of buildings were damaged. One of the most successful missions of theweek was that undertaken by 333 Mustangs and 41 Thunderbolts of VII U.S.Air Force on the 18th;  four oil storage depots were attacked, seven cisterns
being destroyed; the airfields at Lechfeld and JLeipheim were also very success-fully attacked, 69 enemy aircraft (including 35 Me. 262) being reported asdestroyed on the ground and 41 damaged. Enemy opposition was encounteredand 26 aircraft were shot down; eight aircraft are missing.Enemy defensive sorties against Allied tactical aircraft were generally on asmall scale, and enemy close-support forces did not put up any serious effort.On the 18th, however, some 150 aircraft operated over Eastern Holland and western Germany, whilst on the following day it is estimated that about 250sorties were flown in these areas.A total of 1,754 sorties was flown by aircraft carrying supplies to theContinent.Note. dHaid assessments are shown in Appendix VII.Southern Europe.38. During the week ended dawn on the 21st, aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew atotal of 12,059 sorties, and 9,484 tons of bombs were dropped. Of these sorties4,143 were by heavy bombers (71 missing). A total of 133 Allied aircraft is missing; 10 enemy aircraft were destroyed.An improvement in the weather enabled a number of attacks to be madeby heavy bombers on airfields in Italy, on railway and oil targets in austria and South Germany, and on railway centres and other targets in Yugoslavia and czechoslovakia.The Tactical Air Force continued to provide close support for land forces and heavily attacked communications in North Italy and Yugoslavia.Italy.39. In operations by heavy bombers good concentrations were obtained and considerable damage inflicted to the runways, hangars and other buildings on airfields at Udine (2 attacks, 291 tons), Vicenza (2 attacks, 392 tons), A Via no(200 tons), and Villafranca (154 tons). A railway bridge and locomotive depot at Ferrara were bombed (141 tons) with fair results.Communications in the Po Valley and the battle area were attacked verysuccessfully during the week, and close support provided for Allied land forces;on several occasions upwards of eight hundred medium, light and fighter bombers and fighters operated at a time. In the course of these operations an ammuni-tion factory and ammunition and fuel clumps were blown Up, three bridgesdestroyed and three Others damaged, all near Bologna; while other ammunitiondumps were blown up and railways cut near Faenza and Venice. On the 21st,further excellent results were obtained over a defended area at Faenza. Enemygun positions, strong-points, supply clumps and troop concentrations were hitmany times, and a number of locomotives, railway wagons and M.T. destroyed.During the week some 140 locomotives, 800 railway^ Wagons and 280 M.T.were destroyed or damaged.The Coastal Air Force attacked small shipping in the North Adriatic,sinking and setting on fire several vessels and barges.Yugoslavia and Albania.40. Railway targets formed the principal objectives for heavy bombersin Yugoslavia, and although results generally were difficult to observe owing tocloud, they are believed to have been good. Two hundred and seventeen tons were dropped on Sarajevo railway centre in two attacks, and 98 tons at Maribor,which was also visited twice. Other railway centres attacked during the weekwere Graz and Rogatica (30 miles E. of Sarajevo).At Podgorica a total of 396 tons of bombs was released in two attacks ontroop concentrations and bridges; hits were obtained on one bridge and firesstarted in the town, while the railway was cut.Good coverage was observed in two further operations in the Rogatica andNovi Pazar areas, where a total of 147 tons was dropped.On the 21st, 155 Lightnings bombed, and 87 Mustangs machine-gunned liliesof communication in South Yugoslavia. The Lightnings dropped 93 tons,blocking roads and bridges at six places and setting a supply dump on fire.During the operation much damage Was inflicted, and two locomotives, 16 railway wagons and 117 M.T. were destroyed or damaged.At Visegrad (46 miles E.S.E. of Sarajevo) direct hits were obtained On abridge, and troop concentrations were effectively bombed in a subsequent operation.Many hits were observed On roads in the Frijepolje, Sjenica and Priboj areas.
The New Palace and barracks at Tirana sustained much damage from P.P.Beaufighters of the Balkan Air Force, and a number of locomotives, railway wagons and M.T. were destroyed and damaged, and roads and bridges cut.Austria, South Germany and Czechoslovakia.41. Once again cloud prevented the observation of results in a number of attacks by heavy bombers on oil and railway targets. Among the former figuredfive plants near Vienna : Florisdorf (2 attacks, 475 tons), Korneuburg (161 tons),Schwechat (99 tons), Winterhofen (284 tons) and Lobau (191 tons), The benzolplant at Linz (100 miles W, of Vienna) was twice visited (184 tons), and the synthetic oil plant at Blechhammer received 458 tons in two attacks, results inthe second being reported as good.On the 16th, 714 tons of bombs were released on Munich West railway centre by 449 Liberators and Fortresses and a heavy concentration was obtained on the repair shops and locomotive sheds. Gj-ood results were also obtained when141 tons were dropped in two attacks on Innsbruck railway centre and from340 tons released on a similar target at Salzburg.On the 22nd, both Munich and Salzburg were again bombed, the East and west railway centres at Munich each receiving 182 tons, while results were againseen to be good at Salzburg (123 tons).On the same date the following further railway targets were included in theprogramme, but results were difficult to assess : Regensburg, Lienz (68 miles.S.W. of Salzburg), Rosenheim and Villach (25 miles W.N.W. of Klagenfurt).Seven enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and six more damagedwhen Horsching airfield (7 miles SW. of Linz) was bombed by heavies (87 tons),and hits were observed on the runway of this airfield. Two airfields nearVienna and communications S.E. of the city were attacked by 126 Mustangs onthe 19th, and 100 locomotives, 120 railway wagons, 38 M.T. and 100 horse-drawnvehicles were destroyed or damaged during the operation.In Czechoslovakia the railway centre at Brno received 277 tons, while theBata factory at Zlin (78 miles E.S.E. of Olomouc), and the towns of Hodonin andKromeriz (52 and 23 miles S. and S.S.E. of Olomouc respectively) were also bombed successfully.Russia.42. Variable weather during the week affected operations by the Russian AirForce, but activity on the 1st Baltic Front was heavy, and missions against air-fields and communications are reported. High-scale activity took place on the2nd Ukrainian Front in Hungary, in close support of Russian land attacks.The Russian long-range bomber force again undertook no operations duringthe week.Far Bast. -Burma and Siam.43. During the week ended dawn on the 21st, Allied aircraft flew a total of2,514 sorties, of which 1,310 were by bombers and fighter-bombers. ThirteenAllied aircraft are missing.

In the Chindwin area objectives near Kaiewa and.Kalemyo were attacked on several occasions. Hits were obtained on buildings and railway rolling-stock and many bashas were destroyed or damaged, and anumber of rivercraft sunk.In the Katha / Bhamo / Mandalay number of attacks were made onvillages, railway targets and airfields. In the course of these attacks good results were obtained on Kyaikthin railway sidings (115 miles N.N.W. of Manclalay)and at Wuntho and Anisakan airfields, when hits were obtained on two hangars and a building v/as blown, up. Railway tracks were cut at Paleik (10 miles S. of Mandalay).Railways in Central Burma were damaged at Sagaing, where escortedMitchells dropped 23 tons on the yards, and between Chiengrai and Lampang.In Southern Burma 15 Liberators dropped 28 tons on the railway sidingsand jetties at Martaban (102 miles E.S.E. of Rangoon), causing fires: while44 Liberators dropped 118 tons on the yards and engine sheds at Motpalin(62 miles N.E. of Rangoon) with excellent results.
Railway targets also formed objectives in Siam, where 38 Liberators dropped59 tons and damaged a bridge at Kenghhiang (33 miles S.E. of Lampang), setting;fire to buildings and engine sheds at Bhisanulok and Uttaradit, and damaging thetrack at Paknam Bho (140 miles N.N.W. of Bangkok).
