THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 676.22nd November, 1944.WAR CABINET.AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND SUGGESTIONS FOR ANINTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EMPLOYMENT.Memorandum by the Minister oe Labour and National Service and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. We should like to draw the attention of our colleagues to the telegramsrecently exchanged with the Australian and New Zealand Governments on thissubject. The text of these is reproduced in Annex I. The broad background is asfollows : 2. The Australian Government in particular have always taken the line that the creation of conditions which would assure full employment and themaintenance and improvement of standards of living should be regarded by allcountries as the first objective of post-war economic policy. The internationalrecognition of this objective could, they feel, best be secured through the convening of a special Employment Conference designed to lead to an inter-national . agreement wherein each Government would specifically pledge itselfto take all measures within its power to maintain a high level of employmentin its own country. Their point is that Governments would be more ready toundertake the obligations that would be involved by acceptance of the monetary,commercial, commodity and other proposals envisaged under Article VII ofthe Mutual Aid Agreement if they could be assured that other Governments(particularly the United States, Government) would pursue policies leading toa high level of employment. In this attitude they have the full support of theNew Zealand Government.3. This point of view was developed with great insistence by the Australiandelegates at the talks held with Dominion officials in the spring on Article VIIsubjects. It was generally recognised that there was a good deal of substance in the Australian view, and as a result of the talks agreement was reached between the United Kingdom, Dominion and Indian officials that, subject to theapproval of Ministers, a draft agreement in the terms reproduced in Annex IIto this paper should be put forward to the United States authorities &quot;as anessential and central part of the arrangements for implementing Article VIIof the Mutual Aid Agreement and the Atlantic Charter.&quot;4. Notwithstanding this agreement on the official level, which recognisedthat the subject was one which could best be pursued in the context of theArticle VII discussions, the next step of the Australians was to raise the matterpublicly, and without previous consultation with us, at the I.L.O. Conference atPhiladelphia. Further, their handling of the matter at the Conference was somewhat maladroit, with the result that a good deal of controversy was arousedas to the part which the I.L.O. should play in the promotion of an internationalagreehaent between Governments on this subject. In particular, strong oppositionwias expressed by the workers&apos; and employers&apos; groups to any proposal for anInternational Employment Conference limited solely to Governments. Finally,a resolution was passed by the Conference in the following terms : The Conference recommends to Governments that a conference ofrepresentatives of the Governments of the United, associated and other nations, willing to attend, be called at an early  date, in association with the[28667] B
Governing Body of the International Labour Office, to consider an inter-national agreement on domestic policies of employment and unemployment;and this Conference pledges the full co-operation and the assistance of theInternational Labour Organisation in calling such a conference on employ-ment, and in helping to carry into effect appropriate decisions it might make.&quot;5. The Australians also raised the matter at the Bretton Woods Conference,where they put forward a draft Resolution covering substantially the same groundas the draft agreement in Annex II. Notwithstanding the support of the UnitedKingdom Delegation, this draft resolution was rejected by a large majority, itsfate being determined by the opposition of the United States Delegation whofelt that the linking of this subject with the monetary proposals was inopportuneand inappropriate.6. A few weeks later the Australians again reverted to the subject with us and suggested that we should join with them in an approach to the UnitedStates Government with a view to the calling either of the conference envisaged in the Philadelphia resolution, or a special conference with substantially thesame objectives (see the first telegram in Annex I). As a result of the successivemoves made by the Australians, the position had by then become a somewhatconfused one, and the view taken here.was that, while the objective of securinggeneral acceptance of an international employment agreement was one whichwe could support, the best hope of carrying other Governments with us would lie in treating the subject as one to be dealt with in the course of the Article VIIdiscussions, as originally contemplated, rather than at a separate conference to be convened specially for the purpose. In our reply, therefore, we pointedout the difficulties of the course proposed by the Australians and suggested thatit would be wiser to deal with the matter as part of the arrangements for implementing Article VII (second telegram in Annex I).7. The matter was next discussed between the Australian and New zealand governments at their recent Conference at Wellington, when disappointment was expressed at our reply and a decision reached that the two Governments &quot; werenot prepared to alter their previous determination -to press for a special conference at an early date for the purpose of an employment agreement.&quot; Thetwo Governments then recorded their agreed views in the following terms :  &quot; We regard an employment agreement by which signatories undertaketo pursue internal policies of full employment and increased consumptionas fundamental to the success of all aspects of international collaborationdesigned to increase living standards. The calling of an employmentconference with this objective in view should take precedence over all other international economic discussions. We propose, therefore, to approach theUnited States Government with the proposal that a conference be called bythe United States Government in conjunction with the United Kingdom,Australian and New Zealand Governments.&quot;The text of the Australian telegram communicating these views to us is reproduced as the last telegram in Annex I. A similar telegram was also receivedfrom New Zealand. At the same time a public statement was made at theconclusion of the Conference in the following terms : &quot; The two Governments regard an international agreement to pursuedomestic policies of full employment as fundamental to all international co--operation to promote human welfare. Agreements for the encouragement of trade are most necessary, and it is a matter of immediate concern that international discussions about this should proceed. To be successful, thelatter must however operate in a world not afflicted by unemployment. Themost important first step towards attaining this would be for each Govern-ment, recognising its obligations to its own people and to the people ofevery other country, to join in an international agreement pledging itselfto follow an appropriate domestic policy of full employment.&quot;8. The matter has been further discussed between officials of the Depart-ments concerned in the light of the Australian and New Zealand telegrams.As a result the conclusion has been reached that there would, as things are, beno harm in our supporting the Australian and New Zealand suggestion withthe Americans, particularly as there would, it is thought, be much to be gained from a general exchange of ideas between Governments on various aspects of domestic employment policies in the post-war period. We endorse this conclusionand it is proposed accordingly, if our colleagues agree, to send a reply to the
Australian and New Zealand telegrams in the terms of the draft reproduced in Annex III. The draft reply stresses the following points to which we attach importance :-(1) The proposed conference should be regarded as forming part of theArticle VII discussions.(2) In view of the resolution passed at the I.L.O. Conference at Philadelphia,the Governing Body of the I.L.O. should be associated with such aconference.(3) The United States Government should be sounded. informally before any official approach is made to them.(4) There should be further discussions between ourselves and the Dominions,preferably by means of a meeting of officials, as to the precise scopeobjective and agenda of such a conference before the international conference is arranged.E. B.C.22nd November, 1944.ANNEX I.Commonwealth Government telegram No. 240 of 15th September, 1944.Addressed Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, No. 240, repeatedWellington, No. 206.Conference on employment.In order to follow up the recommendation made to Governments by the I.L.O.that a conference be held on domestic policies of employment, we wish again tosuggest the necessity of holding at an early date the conference in relation to employment as agreed to by the resolution of the I.L.O., or a conference withsubstantially the same objectives.2. As the Government which sponsored the recommendation at that I.L.O.Conference we would be prepared to take the initiative in approaching UnitedStates Government. However, we see considerable advantages in the approach to united States being made by United Kingdom Government in conjunction withAustralian, New Zealand and other Governments you may suggest.3. We should be glad to have your approval of these plans, as we believe the opportunity, if lost now, may be very difficult to regain.4. As you know, the employment approach to economic policy has beenadopted by Australia, and the attitude of Parliament to international economicproposals contemplated, especially to monetary plans, may be greatly affected byacceptancev of an international obligation in relation to employment, and weshould at any rate leave no stone unturned to secure such an agreement.Dominions   Office   Telegram   No.   293   to   Commonwealth   Government   of23rd October, 1944.Addressed Commonwealth of Australia No. 293, repeated New ZealandNo. 239 Secret.Your telegram No. 240 repeated Wellington No. 206. Conference on employment.Careful consideration has been given to your suggestion that joint approach should now be made to United States Government with a view to following upresolution of I.L.O. Conference at Philadelphia by the early holding either of aninternational employment conference in association with Governing Body ofI.L.O., or of a purely governmental conference with substantially the sameobjectives.2.   We fully share the view that domestic employment aspect should be keptprominently in the forefront in minds both of Governments and general public in connection with post-war economic plans.   It is clear, however, that matter[28667] b 2
demands careful approach if we are to carry other Governments with us, and ifwe favour a different procedure from that suggested in your telegram it is withthis consideration in mind, and not because we attach less importance to the objective than you do.3. The more we reflect on the possibilities the stronger becomes our con-viction that the subject properly belongs to the general field of Article VII ofthe Mutual Aid Agreement, and would best be dealt with in that context. Inthe report of the talks between British Commonwealth officials earlier in theyear, when the proposals of your representatives on this subject aroused keeninterest, the recommendation was made that an international employment agree-ment should be regarded as an &quot; essential and central part of the arrangementsfor implementing Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement and the atlantic charter.&quot; We feel sure that we should be well advised to adhere to this methodof approach.4. There are special difficulties attaching to either of the alternativesmentioned in your telegram. As regards the possibility of following up theI.L.O. resolution with a view to the convening of a conference in association withthe Governing Body of the I.L.O., two main considerations present themselves.(1) The unlikelihood that it would be practicable to hold such a conference,having regard to the terms of the Philadelphia resolution, withoutrepresentation of the employers&apos; and workers&apos; groups of the I.L.O.(2) The position of Russia, since it is by no means clear that Russia wouldbe willing to attend conference such as that proposed in I.L.O.resolution. On the other hand, it may be doubted whether it wouldbe practicable for Governments in face of terms of I.L.O. resolution to proceed with holding of a special employment conference limited togovernmental representatives alone. Added to these considerationsis the fact that all available evidence in our possession indicates thatapproach to United States Government at present time would lead to&quot;no useful result, since if we have judged attitude of United states administration correctly, it is clear that they would be most unlikely to wish to pursue this subject until Presidential election is over.5. In these circumstances we are satisfied that progress is more likely tobe made if, instead of aiming at holding of special conference, subject isapproached as part of arrangements for implementing Article VII, and we feel sure that Governments are more likely to respond if proposal for inter-national agreement is considered along with other proposals for international arrangements within the framework of Article VII, as they take shape. Wesuggest accordingly that it would be wise to defer approach to Americans forthe time being, but that special point should be made of raising matter withthem as soon as opportunity arises for discussions under Article VII to be resumed. Future procedure could &quot;then be considered in the light of their actions.Commonwealth Government Telegram No. 300 of 13th November, 1944.(No. 300.  Secret.)YOUR telegram No. 293 to Australia, No. 239 to New Zealand.The recent Conference in Wellington between Australia and New Zealandrepresentatives has given consideration to the proposed conference on employment,and also to the views of the United Kingdom Government in that connection.The Conference expressed their keen disappointment at the reply to thesuggestion that the United Kingdom Government should approach the UnitedStates Government on the subject of a conference on employment, and in particularparagraph 5 of your telegram. The Conference felt, after full consideration, thatthey were not prepared to alter their previous determination to press for a special conference at an early date for the purpose of an employment agreement.1 2. They desire to point out also that they have never disagreed that thesubject of domestic policies of employment belongs to. the general field ofArticle (VII), but that does not, in their view, mean there should be no long orseparate agreement. Other subjects within the Article (VII) field have beendiscussed separately at special conferences, and incorporated in separate draftproposals. The suggestion you make that the proposal for an international agreement on employment might be considered, not by a separate conference butalong with other proposals for international arrangements within the. framework
of Article (VII) as they take shape, is therefore quite inconsistent withprocedures which have been adopted in respect of other subjects and must havethe effect of pushing employment obligations into the background. For instance,at Bretton Woods, employment was held to be outside the terms of reference of the conference and no binding commitment to Governments regarding domesticpolicies was recommended.3. Both Australia and New Zealand regard this subject as fundamentaland one which cannot be dealt with by the inclusion of a resolution or declaration in each of the other agreements. Not only do they consider that a special conference should be held, but they believe it should be held before other proposals are incorporated in agreements.4. The representatives of the two Governments have at the WellingtonConference therefore agreed as followsWe regard an employment agreement by which signatories undertake to pursue internal policies of full employment and increased consumption asfundamental to the success of all aspects of international collaboration designedto increase living standards. The calling of an employment conference with this objective in view should take precedence over all other international economic discussions. We propose, therefore, to approach the United States Governmentwith the proposal that a conference be called by the United States Governmentin conjunction with the United Kingdom, Australian and New zealand governments.5. Draft documents are in the course of preparation, which should in thefirst instance be discussed with the United Kingdom and United States Govern-ments, and these will be forwarded to you as soon as possible.ANNEX II.Draft of a possible International Employment Agreement/with DominionOfficials for Submission to Ministers, April 1944.(See Annex K to W.P. (44) 192.)(i) Each of the signatory Governments, being determined to do its part to ensure that the victory of the United Nations shall be followed by freedom from want, recognise that this objective cannot be achieved unless its people aregiven the fullest opportunities to work and enjoy the rewards of their labour.(ii) Moreover, each signatory Government recognises that a high level ofemployment among its people is not only fundamental to their material well-being, but will also contribute through the channels of trade to the creation ofemployment for the peoples of other countries and to an increase in their well-being.(iii) Therefore each signatory Government recognises and hereby undertakesa national obligation to its own people and an international obligation to theother signatory Governments henceforth to take such measures as may benecessary and practicable to fulfil this purpose.(iv) Each signatory Government declares to its own people and to other signatory Governments that it will take all measures within its powers to carryout this obligation and, in particular : (a) To secure the provision of opportunities for work of a kind which will maintain and improve the standard of living of the community.(b) To mitigate the unemployment due to fluctuations in activity to which certain trades, industries and services are liable.(v) In addition, each signatory Government undertakes (a) To consult with other Governments and with appropriate internationalauthorities as methods of collecting on an agreed plan detailedstatistics of national employment and unemployment.(6) To take such internal measures as may be practicable and within its powers to collect the statistics relating to its own country requiredby the agreed plan.(c) To submit such statistics to other Governments, through an appropriate international organisation, at intervals not exceeding three months.
(d) To make a report, for the purpose of an annual conference of the member countries, on the state of employment of its people and on theeconomic policies which have been used or are contemplated to combatunemployment.(e) To send representatives concerned with the economic and social policy ofthe Government to meet with representatives of other governments and international authorities at a special conference called by theappropriate organisation, if, in the opinion of that organisation, aserious decline in employment is developing in any of the signatorycountries (for causes whether avoidable or unavoidable by theGovernments of the countries concerned), for the purpose of examining and reporting upon possible national and internationalmeasures to restore the level of employment and to prevent the spread of unemployment to other countries.(vi) In the event of a serious decline in the level of its employment, a member government undertakes to consider measures to restore the level of employment,such as 1(a) Stimulation of private investment.(b) Increase in public investment.(c) Increased consumption expenditure.(d) Expansion of oversea investment where appropriate.ANNEX III.Draft Telegram to Australian and New Zealand Governments.Employment Conference.We .think there has been some misapprehension on this question. It wasin no way our intention to express doubt on the desirability of the conclusionof an employment agreement on the lines agreed on at the meeting of officials in March 1944. Our telegram was directed to the practical question of how the conclusion of an employment agreement can best be secured having regardto the need for carrying the United States and other Governments with us. Weare still of opinion that quick progress is most likely if this question is treated aspart of the Article VII discussions, but that need not preclude a separateconference.2. Since the Australian and New Zealand Governments, who have taken a leading part in this matter, attach the highest importance to the idea of a con-ference on this question being called as soon as possible, we wall gladly give them our full support. It will evidently be necessary, in view of the LL.O.resolution passed at Philadelphia, to associate the Governing Body of the I.L.O.wuth the proposed conference; the Governing Body, at their meeting in london in January, will in any case be considering the action to be taken on the variousresolutions adopted at the Philadelphia Conference and this matter will certainly come up then.3. Would the Australian and New Zealand Governments desire us in thefirst instance to sound the United States Government unofficially % If so, we are ready to take an early opportunity to do this. We suggest that before any document is sent to the Americans there should be a further exchange of viewsbetween us as to the possible scope, objective and agenda of any such- conference.We are looking forward to receiving the draft document to which you referand hope shortly to send you some suggestions which have occurred to us onour side.4. There remains, of course, the question of consultation with other commonwealth and Empire Governments. While the subject was carried to a. certain stage in the talks between Commonwealth officials in London in march last, it would, in our view, be desirable, if possible, that a further similar meetingon the official level should take place before the international conference isarranged in order to clarify more precisely the scope and objectives of theconference. This need not, of course, delay the preliminary soundings of theUnited States Government suggested in paragraph 3 above. We should be glad to have your views as to this. In the meantime, we are deferring communicating with Canada and South Africa.
