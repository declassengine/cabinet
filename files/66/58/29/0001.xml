The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of ParliamentTuesday, 28th November, 1944.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The past year has seen the intensification of the efforts of My peoples andof those of My Allies to free the world from German and Japanese oppressionand we are now reaping the reward of the long years of endurance and preparationthat have gone before.The victories achieved are the fruits of the close friendship which knitstogether My Governments and those of My Allies-a friendship fostered by the meetings between Allied leaders which have played such a notable part in the furtherance of our common purpose.Within the Commonwealth and Empire the ties that unite My peopleswere further strengthened by the meetings in London at which the PrimeMinisters of My Dominions, the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia and representatives of My Empire of India conferred with the Prime Minister ofthe United Kingdom. The declaration which they issued at the conclusion oftheir meetings expressed the common resolve of My peoples to devote their wholeenergies towards victory in the struggle in which we are engaged.In the wider sphere, the meeting at Teheran, where for the first timethe leaders of the United States and of the Soviet Union met in joint conference with My Prime Minister, settled the co-ordinated strategy which has unfoldeditself in the past year. In Cairo My Prime Minister and the President of theUnited States were able to confer with the leader of the Chinese people. Andthis autumn.My Prime Minister has undertaken further arduous journeys, toQuebec to concert with the President of the United States plans for the conductof the war in the Far East, and to Moscow to co-ordinate with Marshal Stalinplans for achieving the final downfall of Hitlerite Germany and to reviewwith him the problems of Europe. More recently he has paid, at the invitation of the President of the French Provisional Government, a visit to Paris, whichhas demonstrated afresh the cordial friendship which unites the French andBritish peoples. . In all these visits he has been assisted by the presence ofMy Foreign Secretary.In the theatres of war throughout the world, the Forces of all My peopleshave continued to fight in close comradeship with the gallant Forces of theUnited States and My other Allies.My Forces from the United Kingdom and from Canada, with theircomrades from the United States, successfully launched the long-prepared assault on the shores of Western Europe, established a foothold in the face of determined opposition, and, after destroying the German armies which opposed them, have advanced through France and Belgium to the gates of Germany.Never before in our history has a single enterprise so completely absorbedthe energies of the whole nation. - Military success has been rendered possibleonly by the devotion with which the Home Guard, the Civil Defence Services andthe Active Air Defences of Great Britain have fulfilled their task of guardingthis island base on which the whole undertaking in Western Europe depends.In the Mediterranean, maintaining the advance which began at El Alamein,the Forces of the United Nations have by hard and determined fighting driventhe enemy from Rome and reached the Northern plains of Italy.. ]n Burma, My Fourteenth Army, including African Colonial Forces andaided by the Forces of the United States and China, has turned the attemptedJapanese invasion of India into a disastrous retreat. In this campaign MyIndian Forces have contributed brilliantly to the defence of their country.w-fLI\a11 Athese victories My Air Forces, fighting in the closest associationwitn tbe Allied Air Forces, have played a conspicuous part. They haveeverywhere engaged the enemy with confidence and courage and their sustained
and gallant attacks in Western Europe, in co-operation with the Air Forces ofthe United States, opened the way for the successful invasion of the Continent.My Navies have been heavily and continuously engaged throughout the-world. In conjunction with My Air Forces they have gained great successesagainst those enemy submarines and surface craft which have dared to show themselves. They secured the safe passage of the vast invasion convoys for the assault on. the shores of Western Europe and they continue to maintain the flow of supplies to My Armies as well as to ensure the safe and timely arrival of thefood and material on which the life and work of the nation depends. This wouldnot have been accomplished without the splendid bravery of our merchant seamen and those of the United Nations and Denmark.It has given Me particular pleasure to have been able to visit units of all my Forces both in Western Europe and in the Mediterranean.Resounding victories have continued to reward the skill and valour ofMy Russian Allies, whose advances have carried them into Eastern Germanyand brought to an end the German domination of South-Eastern Europe.In the Pacific theatre of war the Forces of the United States, valiantlysupported by Australian and New Zealand Forces, have rapidly advanced acrossvast spaces of the ocean and have broken into the outer defences of Japan.The victories achieved and the successful invasion of the Continenthave been made possible by the tireless effort and inventive genius of all thosewho have planned, produced and transported the manifold types of equipment and munitions of war for My Forces and who have maintained the services essential to the prosecution of the war. Our farmers and agricultural workers and the courageous men of the fishing fleets have toiled without respite to providefood for My people, and, in the Forces, in trade and industry, in voluntary service and in the home, women have continued to make their invaluablecontribution towards victory. .The civil population and the Police, Fire and Civil Defence services have again shown those qualities of courage and fortitude which earned theadmiration of the world in 1940 and 1941. The sympathies of the Queen and myself extend to all those who have suffered as a result of the enemy&apos;s attacks,and We are thankful that the advance of the Allied Forces on the Continent has put an end to the shelling of the south-east coast and reduced the enemy&apos;s capacity to launch attacks by flying-bombs and long-range rockets.I rejoice at the freeing of the territory of France, Belgium, Luxembourg,Greece and Yugoslavia, and our sympathy goes out to the Dutch people in theirpresent ordeal. It is My earnest hope that before long deliverance will have cometo the whole of occupied Europe.In every occupied country the enemy has been increasingly harassedby the resistance of the oppressed peoples and I have watched with warmadmiration the great part which the French Forces of the Interior have playedin ridding their country of the invader.My Government have welcomed the establishment in France of a provisional Government, which will govern the country in accordance with the laws of the Republic until general elections can be held. My Government havealso been glad to join with the Government of the United States of America andthe Government of the Soviet Union in inviting the Provisional Government ofFrance to appoint a representative to join as a full and permanent member inthe important work of the European Advisory Commission in London.It is our earnest desire to promote peaceful co-operation among the nations of the world, and to this end important conversations have been held with officials of the United States, the Soviet Union and the Republic of Chinawhich have resulted in the submission to each of the four Governments concerned of agreed suggestions for the formation of an international organisation designedto maintain peace and security.My Government were represented at the twenty-sixth session of theInternational Labour Conference, at the second council meeting of the united nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and at the United NationsMonetary and Financial Conference.
My Government have concluded an agreement with the Governments ofother maritime United Nations, ensuring through a United Maritime authority that their combined shipping resources shall continue to be available for the prosecution of the war in Europe and the Ear East and for all the purposes ofthe United Nations.The need for an enlightened international settlement under which civil air .transport will flourish as an aid to prosperity and peace continues to engagethe attention of My Ministers. Further discussions have been held withrepresentatives from other parts of My Commonwealth and Empire, and theMinister for Civil Aviation has headed a delegation to an international conference convened by the United States of America.Members of the House of Commons :I thank you for the provision which you have made towards the costof the war. The heavy financial sacrifices which My people have continued tomake during the fifth year of the war have been an essential and outstandingfactor in our war effort.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :Although the successful prosecution of the war has been first in the thoughts of My Government and people, progress has been made with plans for the resettle-ment of the men and women who during the war have been employed in the various forms of national service, and for the reconversion of industry from war produc-tion to the production of goods for the needs of My people and for export.I have given my Assent to a number of measures which have been brought before you during the course of the year.A comprehensive Act has been passed to reform the law relating to education in England and Wales in all its aspects, and to secure its progressive development at all stages-. This measure will open new opportunities to theindividual, and will secure to the future service of the community the fullestadvantage from the resources inherent in the national character and capacity.Measures have been passed to provide for the rehabilitation and re-entry into employment of disabled persons and for the reinstatement in their civil employment of men and women in the Services; to facilitate the building ofhouses; to improve water supply and sewerage in rural areas; to assist the herringindustry, and to provide for the redevelopment of war damaged and obsolescentareas and regulate the price of acquisition of land for public purposes.Legislation has also been passed to establish a Ministry of national insurance; to increase the rates of unemployment insurance benefit, and to setup permanent machinery for the redistribution of Parliamentary constituencies and provide for an immediate redistribution of abnormally large constituencies.My Government have outlined the policy which they propose to follow witha view to the maintenance of a high and stable level of employment afterthe war. They have also published for examination and discussion proposalsfor a national health service, for a comprehensive system of national insurance and a new scheme of industrial injury insurance, and for a national water policy.With you, I thank Almighty God for the victories which have been grantedto us during the past year, and I pray that His blessing may attend you at all times.

The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of ParliamentWednesday, 29th November, 1944.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :The United Nations look back on a year of resounding achievement. they now look forward with greater confidence than ever before to those final victorieswhich will give to the peoples of the world the&apos; just peace which is our chiefdesire. In Western Europe My Forces from the United Kingdom and canada and their comrades from the United States, with the valuable aid of the armed forces of My European Allies and of the peoples who have risen to meet them,have routed the enemy in a series of decisive battles and are now pressinghim on the borders of his own country. In Italy the Forces of the United nations have advanced to the northern plains and in Greece and Yugoslavia the germans are being driven from the countries which they have oppressed for three bitteryears. In the East the massive achievements of My Russian Ally have deprivedthe Germans of vast stretches of territory which they hoped would feed theirarmies and provide an impassable barrier to prevent the soil of Germany from becoming a battle-ground. Both in the East and in the West, Germany is invaded. The plight in which her armies now find themselves is a measure of thesuccess which by God&apos;s grace has crowned our arms. In the war against Japanthe enemy has been thrown back from India and My American Ally continues toreduce the shrinking area still under Japanese control in the Pacific. We intend to reinforce as rapidly and powerfully as possible the United Kingdom forces who are now sharing with their comrades from all parts of the British Common-wealth and Empire and from the United States, China, the Netherlands andFrance the burden of the struggle against Japan.My Navies everywhere have maintained their mastery over the enemy andhave achieved great successes, in which My Air Forces have fully shared, indriving his surface and submarine forces from the seas. My Air Forces, in concert with the Air Forces of the United States, have delivered increasinglyheavy blows against Germany and have maintained their support of militaryand naval operations in all theatres.The successes of My Armed Forces would not have been achieved but forthe devoted labours of those throughout the Commonwealth and Empire whohave striven ceaselessly to arm and equip them. It is over five years now sinceMy peoples first took up the struggle to free the world from aggression and the contribution of the civil population is beyond all praise.The United Nations await with sober confidence the unrolling of futureevents. Joined in an unbreakable alliance and fortified by constant collaboration between the Governments concerned and by frequent personal meetings between their leaders, they look forward to that day on which the aggressor is finallydefeated and the whole world can turn to the rebuilding of prosperity and themaintenance of an unassailable peace.Members of the House of Commons :You will be asked to make further financial provision for the conduct ofthe war and for the other necessary services.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :Victory remains our supreme aim and to this end you will be invited topass such further legislation as may be required for the effective prosecution ofthe war.Once, however, the war in Europe is over, the transition from war to peacewill begin; and My Ministers are actively preparing plans to ensure that,without in any way prejudicing the active prosecution of the war against Japan,an increasing part of our resources is made available for civilian production.They will try to create conditions favourable to the expansion of our exporttrade and the re-equipment of our industry and to maintain a high level offood production at home.  They are considering the methods by which the policy
for the maintenance of a high level of employment can be implemented, especially with regard to the distribution of industry in the Development Areas. progress will be made in fulfilling the urgent tasks of providing additional housing accommodation and of increasing supplies of civilian goods. My Ministers willcontinue their policy of ensuring a fair distribution of the necessaries of lifeso long as there is any scarcity.My Government. intend that, as opportunity serves, progress should bemade with legislation arising out of the proposals already made public for a comprehensive health service, an enlarged and unified scheme of national insurance, a new scheme of industrial injury insurance and a system of family allowances. They will also invite you to approve measures embodying proposalsfor a national water policy which have already been presented to you.A Bill will be laid before you dealing with electoral reform based on therecommendations of Mr. Speaker&apos;s Conference, and a Bill providing for the resumption of local elections at the appropriate time. You will be invited to passmeasures relating to the provision of finance for the capital expenditure which local authorities will incur after the end of hostilities in Europe and proposalsfor the adjustment of local government areas in England and Wales will also belaid before you.You will be asked to approve legislation designed to extend export credit facilities and to conserve, subject to appropriate safeguards, the use or value of assets created at the public expense on requisitioned and other land.Measures will also be laid before you making further provision for the regulation of wages and conditions of employment and for the development of thepublic educational system in Scotland.There will be presented to you legislation making further provision forassistance towards the development of the Colonial Empire both by prolonging the period covered by the Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1940 and bysubstantially increasing the provision of funds authorised to be made under that Act.I pray that the Almighty may give His blessing to your counsels.
