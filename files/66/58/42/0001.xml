Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 692.%th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.ARGENTINE MEAT CONTRACT.Note by the Prime Minister.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, copies of two telegrams I have sent to President Roosevelt about the Argentine and the Britishmeat contract.1. You will by now have received the print I sent you about the argentine and British meat contracts. May I ask you to read again my telegram of14th July, 1944, with its enclosure of the minute by the Food Minister, in which you will see that the contract mentioned was one of three to four years. It wasin reply to this telegram that you sent your 730 of 23rd July, which began&quot;I would not do anything in the world to cut down the supply of meat toEngland. Heaven knows that it is quite short enough. We would do nothing to prevent your getting a new contract.&quot; See also the last sentence of my reply-to Stettinius of 5th August.2. It is perfectly clear there that we had your full agreement in makinga three to four years&apos; contract in July. However, on 11th October, you sent mea strongish telegram to Moscow asking that we would continue on &quot; a month&apos;W. S. C.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,26th November, 1944.Prime Minister to President Roosevelt.No. 832.   26.11.44.[28696]
to month basis for some time to come.&quot; In order to meet your wishes ata critical time, I agreed &quot; that no long-term contract is to be negotiated forthe next couple of months or so and that we are to proceed meanwhile on a month to month basis, during which time we can discuss matters further.&quot;3. The &quot;couple of months or so&quot; is now nearly up and of course the Food Minister wishes to make his contract. I have however already received your No. 651 in which you express a wish for further prolongation ofthe month to month basis. From the beginning I have told my colleagues that owing to our financial relationship and the scale on which you are helping usto play our part in the common war effort, and for many other kindly and friendly acts, I would not allow money to count in the matter. I have absolvedthe Minister of Food from his duty of making the most thrifty contracts in his power and have said that only if our food supply in beef and mutton is endangeredshould we have to resist your desires.4. I put this matter strongly to the Cabinet and they agreed about themoney aspect and also felt the risk of our losing our meat supply might beaccepted in the near future. In consequence we shall be prepared to continue on a month to month basis for six months from the 1st December, 1944. We do this on the understanding, to which I am sure you will agree, that all yourinfluence and weight will be used to keep other buyers out of the Argentinemarket, and make sure they do not get refrigerated cargo-space. We hope thiswill be satisfactory to you. It is always my earnest desire to assist you in anyway we can, having regard to all the many things you do for us.5. Since however I brought this matter before my Cabinet. I received the document contained in my immediately following telegram. I was, of course,very much hurt that this form of pressure should be applied to us, and I hopeit will not be thought that the Cabinet was aware of it or influenced by it atthe time they agreed to my request. It seems almost to amount to a threat of indirect blockade arising out of a matter on which I have your jDromise ofthe 23rd July. I feel sure that you yourself were not aware that this document was being sent to us and certainly Ambassador Winant knew nothing of itsdelivery.   I am therefore withholding it from circulation to. the Cabinet.Prime Minister to President Roosevelt. No. 833.   26.11.44.My immediately preceding telegram.The following is document dated 20th November, 1944, mentioned inparagraph 5 (letter from Mr. W. J. Gallman, United States Embassy, toMr. J. V. T. W. T. Perowne, Foreign Office) :-Dear Perowne,I wish to refer to previous correspondence with the Foreign Office concerningexports to Argentina and the purchase of Argentine products. These questions were dealt with in detail in Mr. Winant&apos;s letters of 14th August and September to Mr. Eden. As you know, we are still awaiting the ForeignOffice&apos;s reply to these questions.
We have now received a telegram from the State Department nailing our:attention to a specific problem which has arisen, which has a bearing on this general question of Argentine exports and imports. The facts in the case areas follows: an Export Licence for 13 tons of synthetic rubber, which is needed in a sealing compound for the Argentine meat pack that is intended forthe United Kingdom is at this time under consideration by the State Department.The granting of such a Licence is made difficult by a number of factors, among/&apos;hem being our rubber agreement with Brazil. The Agencies of the Government-of the United States charged with passing on this Export Licence would thereforehesitate to approve a Licence in view of the failure of the Foreign Office to informus regarding the steps your Government is prepared to take to reduce exports toand imports from the Argentine. :The State Department tells us, moreover, that until this information -regarding the steps that your Government is prepared to take with reference toArgentine exports and imports is received, it is reluctant to authorise the exportof any products from the United States which would be used in connection withArgentine exports to the United Kingdom. There are many cases besides thisparticular one involving synthetic rubber which are constantly being presented.This case involving synthetic rubber is, however, particularly troublesome.Should a request for the concurrence of Brazil be laid in this case and a shipment \from the United States be made, it might make it very difficult for the authorities of Brazil to continue to resist pressure for meeting the general rubber needs ofArgentina.We have been asked by the State Department to bring this case to theattention of the Foreign Office, stressing at the same time the urgency of getting:a clear and definite indication of your Government&apos;s position on the general/question of exports to Argentina and purchases of Argentine products. -1Sincerely, :;W. J. GALLMAN.   -,1
