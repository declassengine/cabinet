THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  November 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 700.22nd November, 1944.WAR CABINET.WAR GRATUITY FOR THE ARMED FORCES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,MEN released from the Armed Forces are already to receive eight weeks&apos;resettlement leave on full pay and allowances, with an additional period of paidleave for men with service overseas. Civilian clothes will be issued to the valueof about  12 at retail prices, and men who have served in the ranks will havethe service post-war credit which has been accruing since January 1942.Provision is made for reinstatement, for further education or training, for thecompletion of apprenticeships, and for resettlement grants up to  150 for thosewishing to restart in business on - their own account. The post of the releasebenefits and post-war credits alone will approach  500 millions. It has been announced that in addition a war gratuity will be granted and the amount ofthis gratuity now requires to be settled.2. I have discussed this question with the Service Ministers and theSecretary of State for India, and we have reached agreement on the general principles to be followed. We propose that the gratuity should take the formof a lump sum for each complete month&apos;s war service on full pay, the monthlyrate being determined by the highest rank held for at least six months. (service in the ranks and commissioned service would be reckoned separately and theresults added together in the case of men with both kinds of service.) I have not,however, been able to reach agreement with my colleagues on the basic monthlyrates for other ranks and for officers, respectively. The measure of differencebetween us is illustrated in the two sets of rates given in the appendix. The scale proposed by the Service Ministers (notwithstanding that it represents a substan-tial modification of the original proposals made by the Service Departments)involves expenditure which is not likely to fall far short of  300 millions. my proposal would represent a substantial saving, but would still cost well over 200 millions. The gratuities after the last war cost something over  150 millions.3. The Service Ministers acknowledge that, whichever basis of gratuity is adopted, the total provision made for ex-Service men, including the gratuity, willnot only be adequate but generous; in the case of other ranks, at any rate, itwill far exceed that made after the last war. They hold the view, however, that,although the resettlement measures should properly be looked at as a whole, therewill be a tendency in some quarters, in Parliament and elsewhere, to consider thewar gratuity in isolation. They have urged upon me strongly that suchconsideration of the war gratuity by itself, which they fear would be unavoidable,would afford an opportunity for criticism of the amount, and it is their considered opinion that they would have difficulty in defending rates lower than they havesuggested, and in particular a rate of less than 15s. a month for the bottom ranks.In my view a basic rate of 10s. a month is fully adequate and defensible. It yieldsslightly better results for other ranks than the gratuities given after the last war, when no provision was made in other directions on anything approaching the present scale. Even under my proposal, a private soldier, married with one child, who has served five years, including three years overseas, will receive releasebenefits totalling at least  143. I accordingly lay the matter before my colleagues in the War Cabinet for their decision. I should point out that in any event a differential of as much as 20s. a month between the rate for the highest &quot; otherrank and the lowest commissioned rank &quot; seems to me excessive on merits.[28726]Copy No.
4. The related question whether the Navy should receive prize money andprize bounty in addition to war gratuity remains unresolved. These grants, asI pointed out in my Memorandum of the 27th March last (W.P. (44) 172), are entirely anachronistic, and if made on this occasion would create inequalitiesbetween man and man of the sort which we have persistently striven to avoid inthe framing of the Release Scheme and its attendant financial benefits. I should accordingly like to see the announcement regarding war gratuity coupled with anannouncement that prize money will not be ]p iyciDiOj&apos; ttu Ciller rate to individualseamen.  At the same time, in my view, prize bounty should be declared obsolete.J.
