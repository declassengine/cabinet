ANNEX.I.Correspondence between Mr. Eden and Mr. Molotov. regarding thePreservation of Bulgarian Assets, the Procurement of BulgarianSupplies for Allied War Industry, &amp;c.Mr. Eden to Mr. Molotov.Dear Mr. Molotov, . Moscow, 15th October, 1944.I AM glad to learn that, as a result of our meeting yesterday and of the workof the drafting committee last night, we are now in agreement upon the main points which were outstanding upon the text of the Armistice for Bulgaria. the revised text for the Armistice which Mr. Novikov sent to Mr. Balfour this morn-ing is acceptable to me and I will so instruct the United Kingdom representative on the European Advisory Commission.I am also glad to see that we have been able to agree upon the provisions,.tobe inserted in a supplementary protocol, regarding the -use of Bulgarian food-stuffs for relief in Greece and Yugoslavia and the provision of the necessarycurrency and other facilities required by the Allied representatives in Bulgaria.There is I think now only one point outstanding, and that is the clause aboutthe preservation of Bulgarian assets so as to prevent the Bulgarian government from escaping from their liability to make reparation for loss and damagesuffered by the Allies at their hands. I had understood at our meeting yesterdaythat the Soviet Government agreed to this being inserted in the protocol, but I nowlearn that this is not so, although you are prepared for instructions to be given tothe Allied Control Commission in the sense which we and the Americans desire.I am disappointed that we did not after all settle this point yesterday, but so long as it is clearly understood that the necessary instruction will be given to theControl Commission I do not wish to insist upon the matter being dealt with inthe protocol.As an alternative arrangement I suggest that we should, by this letter and your reply, agree that we will each issue to Our respective representatives on theControl Commission a definite instruction in the terms of the draft which Ienclose, and that we should invite the United States Government to instruct their representative on the Commission similarly. (The terms of the instruction are thesame as those in the first paragraph of the draft protocol which I gave you yester-day, except that, in view of the new arrangement whereby the chairman of theControl Commission is to be the representative of the Allied (Soviet) high command, I have referred to the necessary orders to the Bulgarian government being issued directly by the Control Commission.)As regards the other two items which figured in the British draft protocol,I agreed yesterday at your request to drop the suggested reference to theassistance of the Soviet authorities in the procurement of supplies required forthe war industry of my country, in consideration of your personal assurance thatany such requirements of my Government would be supported by the SovietGovernment.I also do not press my suggestion that the protocol should contain a referenceto our personal understanding that the British and American representatives willnot take their seats on the Control Commission until the conclusion of hostilities with Germany.  We can, as you prefer, leave this to be understood between us.There remains only the question of the publication of the protocol. you were good enough to say yesterday that you would have no objection to thepublication of the clause respecting the provision of Bulgarian foodstuffs for the populations of the devastated regions in Greece and Yugoslavia. I do not think there is any objection to the publication of the other provisions of the protocoland I hope therefore that you will agree that it may be made public at the sametime as the text of the Armistice. As you know, I am anxious that public opinion in my country shall be reassured that proper reparation will be made by Bulgariato Greece and Yugoslavia for the wrongs which she has done to them.It is my understanding that the draft Armistice and supplementary protocolshall now be tabled at the European Advisory Commission, and that the agreement[28645] B 3
of the United States Government shall be obtained through that channel. It is,of course, clearly understood between us that the agreement which we have reachedhere at Moscow cjoes not bind the United States Government, who are represented in this matter by their delegate on the European Advisory Commission.Yours sincerely,ANTHONY EDEN.Enclosure.IN order to ensure the fulfilment of the obligation laid upon the bulgarian government in Article 9 to make reparation for loss and damage caused by thewar to the United Nations, including Greece and Yugoslavia, the Allied control commission will take the necessary steps to prevent the disposal of Bulgarianassets abroad, or the disposal of internal Bulgarian assets, to foreign.governments or foreign nationals. Exceptions will only be granted by special authority ofthe Allied Control Commission.Mr. Molotov to Mr. Eden.(Translation.)Dear Mr. Eden, Moscow, 16th October, 1944.WITH reference to your letter of the 15th October, I, for my part, note with satisfaction that agreement has been reached between us on all the main points of the draft armistice agreement with Bulgaria which, until now, had not beenagreed. We therefore have still to agree only on&apos;one point, regarding Bulgarianinternal and foreign assets. In reverting to this question, I must say that after further examination I see no possibility of agreeing with your proposal aboutthe Bulgarian assets, especially as neither the agreement with Roumania northe agreement with Finland provided for such a condition with regard to theRoumanian and Finnish Governments.As regards the other two points which were originally included in&apos; the British draft of the Protocol, I note your agreement not to insist upon the inclusionof these points in the Inter-Allied Protocol. However, I consider it necessaryto state that with regard to the question of Bulgarian supplies for the war industry in Allied countries, our three Allied countries must be placed in an equal position, and in that sense I agree to your proposal about the help ofthe Soviet authorities in providing equipment necessary for the war industryin your country just as in similar cases I rely on the same co-operation in favourof Soviet industries on the part of the British authorities.The Soviet Government have&apos;no objection to the publishing of the Inter-Allied Protocol agreed between us.There are also no objections against the early handing over to the european advisory Commission of the whole draft of the Agreement and Protocol forthe purpose of obtaining the approval of the United States Government.Yours sincerely,V. M. MOLOTOV.Mr. Eden to Mr. Molotov.Dear Mr. Molotov, Moscoiv, 17th October, 1944.I AM much obliged for your letter of the 16th October, regarding the out-standing points on the Bulgarian Armistice.I regret that the Soviet Government do not see their way to accept mycompromise proposal about the preservation of Bulgarian assets, as I believethat it must be in the common interest to ensure that Bulgaria does not dissipatethe resources from which she will have to make reparation for the loss and damageshe has done, to Allied States. However, as I told you at cur meeting on the16th October, I agree to drop the matter for the present on our understandingthat I am free to revert to it if it should prove that Bulgaria is in fact.trying to conceal or disperse her assets.I am grateful for your&apos; statement about &apos; the &apos; procurement of Bulgariansupplies for the war industry of the three Allied countries--and entirely agreethat we should mutually assist one another in this matter.I am also much obliged for your agreement to the publication of the Protocol.
The complete texts for the Armistice and the Protocol have been telegraphedto London and I have instructed the United Kingdom representative on theEuropean Advisory Commission to concert with his Soviet colleague in orderto bring them urgently before the Commission.Yours sincerely,ANTHONY EDEN.II.Letter from Mr. Molotov giving the Soviet Governments interpretation of Article 18 as regards the operation of the Control Commission inthe period after the end of hostilities with germany, and Mr. EdEN&apos;sacknowledgment.Mr. Molotov to Mr. Eden.(Translation.)Dear Mr. Eden, Moscow, 15th October, 1944.WITH reference to the new wording accepted by us on the 14th Octoberof Article 18 of the draft Armistice Agreement with Bulgaria I consider itnecessary in this letter to return to the comments made by me on the questionof the direction of the work of the Allied Control Commission during thesecond period of its activities. Taking into account your aim and that ofMr. Winant to have such a wording of this Article which would provide thenecessary differentiation between the nature of the work of the Allied control commission during the first and second periods of its activities, I agree to the wording of Article 18 as proposed by you subject to the amendment with which you are acquainted. It must be repeated that this amendment, as I stated onthe 14th October, must find its proper practical expression in the relativedirections of the work of the Control Commission during the second period ofits activities. It is for this reason, as you will remember, that I suggested toreplace the words &quot;under the chairmanship of the Soviet Representative&quot; bythe words &apos;&apos; under the chairmanship of the Representative of the Allied (Soviet)High Command,&quot; which, in substance, would mean that the direction of theAllied Control Commission would belong to the Soviet High Command duringthe second period also. Of course, in accordance with our agreement, the leadingrole of the Soviet High Command in the Allied Control Commission in thesecond period of its activities will to some extent be restricted in favour of theBritish and American representatives. But one cannot agree, as I indicatedon the 14th October, with the remarks contained in the British Embassy&apos;sMemorandum of the 23rd September to the effect that the Three governments must have equal participation in the practical work and responsibility of theCommission. Such a construction, as I wrote to you on the 14th October,would in practice mean the elimination of the Soviet Command from thedirection of the Control Commission, which, in substance, in view of the presentcircumstances in Bulgaria cannot but lead to the complete elimination of alldirection in the work of the Allied Control Commission as regards the exerciseof control over the fulfilment by the Bulgarian Government of the armistice terms and which would not be in the interests of the Allied States.In agreeing to the new wording of Article 18, as proposed by you, withthe inclusion therein -of the above-mentioned amendment, the Soviet Govern-ment proceeds in this case from the necessity of maintaining the leading rolefor the Soviet High Command, though in a somewhat different form also duringthe second period of the Allied Control Commission^ activities, as we agreed as a result of our talks.Yours sincerely,V. MOLOTOV.Mr. Eden to Mr. Molotov.Dear Mr. Molotov,I ACKNOWLEDGE the receipt of your letter of the 15th October, in which you were good enough to confirm the observations which you made to me at theKremlin on the 14th October regarding the interpretation placed by the SovietGovernment upon the text of Article 18 of the draft armistice for Bulgaria as now agreed between us.Yours sincerely,ANTHONY EDEN.
III.Letter from * United States representative on the European advisory commission to the acting Soviet representative (similar letter addressedalso to the United Kingdom representative), containing the reservation of the United States Government with regard to Article 18 of theArmistice, and the replies of the Soviet and United Kingdom repre-sentatives.Mr. Winant to Mr. Rosh.(Secret.)Dear Mr. Rosh, London, 22nd October, 1944.IN view of the presence of the Bulgarian Delegation in Moscow, where itis awaiting presentation of Armistice terms by the representatives of the threeAllied Governments, in view also of the approaching expiration of the time-limitset for the withdrawal of Bulgarian forces and officials from the territories of greece and Yugoslavia, and in view of my Government&apos;s desire to make everycontribution in its power towards expediting the completion of the armistice terms in the European Advisory Commission, I am empowered to join with you and our British colleague in approving the present draft Armistice terms for submission to the three Governments. In so doing I am also directed to informmy colleagues that my Government continues to feel that Article 18 of theArmistice should properly contain an additional provision to the effect that:--&apos;&apos; Upon the conclusion of hostilities against Germany and until theconclusion of peace with Bulgaria, the Allied Control Commission will regu-late and supervise the execution of the Armistice according to the instruc-tions of the Governments of the United States of America, the Union of soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom.&quot;I wish, therefore, at this time to inform you and our British colleague that my government may find it necessary at a later date to discuss with the two AlliedGovernments the detailed manner in which Article 18 should be implementedduring the period subsequent to the conclusion of hostilities against Germany.I am writing similarly to Sir William Strang.Sincerely,JOHN G. WINANT.Mr. Koukin to Mr. Winant.(No. 4042-a.)Dear Mr. Winant, Soviet Embassy, 28th October, 1944.IN connexion with your letter of 22nd October we think it necessary tomake the following explanations regarding Article 18 of the Draft Agreementconcerning an armistice with. Bulgaria, which was agreed upon between theSoviet and British Governments after several discussions of the question withMr. Eden in Moscow, and which has now been approved by the United states delegation on the European Advisory Commission. In consideration of your andMr. Eden&apos;s desire to have this Article worded in such a way as to make the relevant differentiation between the character of the Allied Control Commission^work in the first and second period of its activity, the Soviet government accepted the wording of Article 18 proposed by the British Government on condition that it was amended so as to substitute the words &apos;&apos; under the chairman-ship of the representative of the Soviet (Allied) High Command &quot; for the words&quot;under the chairmanship of the Soviet representative.&quot; This should mean in substance that the direction of the Allied Control Commission would lie withthe Soviet High Command during the second period, also. It is, of course,understood that the Soviet High Command&apos;s directing role in the Allied control commission would in the second period of its activity be to some extent limited in favour of the American and British representatives.It is impossible, however, to accept your suggestion to add to Article 18 a clause to the effect that &apos;&apos; on the conclusion of hostilities against Germany andpending the conclusion of peace with Bulgaria, the Allied Control commission will regulate and supervise the execution of the armistice conditions in accordancewith the instructions of the Governments of the United States of America, theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United Kingdom.&quot; The inclusionof this addition might be construed to mean that the three Governments should
have an identical share in the practical activity and responsibilities of the Com-&apos; mission, although only the Soviet Union has troops on Bulgarian territory and bulgaria has not been divided into zones of occupation between the Allied States.In practice such an interpretation would lead to the Soviet Command beingdisplaced from the direction of the Control Commission, and in view of thecircumstances prevailing in Bulgaria this could not but lead to the removal ofall control in general over the work of the Allied Control Commission in super-vising the fulfilment by the Bulgarian Government of the armistice conditions,which would not be in the interest of the Allied countries.In accepting the new wording of Article 18, as proposed by the BritishGovernment, and with the above Soviet amendment, the Soviet Government werebasing their attitude in this case on the necessity of maintaining the directingrole of the Soviet High Command, though in a somewhat different form, in the-second period of the Allied Control Commission^ activity also.In view of the foregoing I presume that the American Delegation will not press their proposal to discuss still further the application of Article 18 duringthe period following the conclusion of hostilities against Germany.Yours sincerely,K. KOUKLN.U.S.S.R. Charge d&apos;Affaires.Sir W. Strang to Mr. Winant.(Secret.)Dear Mr. Winant, *2Uh October, 1944.I DULY transmitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government the letter which youhanded to me on the 22nd October when signifying your approval of theArmistice terms for Bulgaria recommended by the European Advisory Corn-mission to the three Governments.His Majesty&apos;s Government have taken due note of the. views of the UnitedStates Government on Article 18 of the draft Armistice with Bulgaria, and willbe happy to discuss at a later date, should the United States Government desireit, the detailed manner in which effect should be given to Article 18 during theperiod subsequent to the conclusion of hostilities against Germany.Yours sincerely,W. STRANG.
