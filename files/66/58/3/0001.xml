The text ofthe Government of India&apos;s telegram of the 4th November towhich the draft telegram will be a reply is also annexed as appendix C for convenience of reference.The telegram to the - Government of India informs them thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government could not and would not approve the enforcement of prohibitions on the import from South Africa ofmaterials which are required for essential war purposes and -which cannot be procured from other sources either at all o&apos;rwithout serious disarrangement of shipping programmes ox-existing financial arrangements.      This means in effect thatwe refuse to the Government of India the right to make effective the stoppage.of trade which they contemplate as themain form of retaliation against the South African Government.Although the Government of India have not  taken any decisionto resort to a stoppage of trade with South Africa until theyhave heard the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government they havedefinitely asked for the help of His Majesty&apos;s Government  inmaking their threat to denounce the trade agreement effective and it is quite possible that a refusal to allow them to dowill lead to resignations from the Viceroy&apos;s Council.9SOThe telegram to the United Kingdom High Commissioner inSouth Africa requests him to, convey orally to Field marshal smuts a personal message from the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.(intld.)

TELEGRAM TO GOVERNMENT OP INDIA COMLONWEALTHRELATIONS DEPARTMENTSECRETYour telegram of the 4th November,  14-273,      South Africa,His Majesty&apos;s Government have noted with great regret that theGovernment of India have felt compelled to resort to retaliation against South Africa in consequence of the proceedings In theNatal Legislature.      Quite&quot;&apos;apart from the unfortunate effect ofan open rupture between two units in the British Commonweai lLof Nations, and the prejudicial effects it may have on theconduct of the war, are you really convinced that the differences, which I fully recognise, between the PretoriaAgreement and the Natal Ordinance, are yet of such a fundamental character as to call for the extreme measureswhich you have proposed?2.      While.not attempting to pronounce on the relation of the ordinance passed by the Natal Assembly to the PretoriaAgreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel &apos;compelled to ash theGovernment of India to recall the circumstances which led tothe Pegging Act, particularly the disastrous second Brocmereport the evidence of which points clearly to theresponsibility of certain rich Indians who deliberately 1 rokethe Agreement made by Field Marshal Smuts on his withdrawalof the Hertzog proposals in 1939.      The action of these Indians,to which little or no -publicity seems to have been giv^n inIndia,  is all the more regrettable  in view of the distinctlyfavourable tenor of Broome&apos;s first report, and in justice to south Africa His Majesty&apos;*s Government think that even at thrfslate hour some attempt should be made in India to place atleast part of the responsibility for the present impasse onthe shoulders of the men whose deliberate evasion of the 1939pact led ta the revelations, which were the immediate cause cft he p e g g i n g Ac t.3.      His Ma,jesty&apos;s Government cannot but feel that the      - --measures already taken by the Government of India, and the tone of the Assembly Debate, are hardly calculated in the longrun to improve the position of (Indians in the Union,      On thecontrary,,they seem likely greatly to hinder the progress,  thoughadmittedly It was slow, which had till recently been made towards a solution of the most difficult Indian problem in theEmpire. -    As the Government of India are aware, after thepegging Act was passed a solid ma.ss of vocal South AJTrica.^European opinion emerged which favoured a more liberal Indianpolicy in respect of both housing and the franchise.      HisMajesty&apos;s Government fear that the present action of theGovernment of India may now not only alienate that opinionbut even render it actively hostile.      In particular theydeeply regret the reported personal attacks on Field marshal smuts in the Assembly Debate,  for more than anyone else $foeField Marshal has endeavoured to give a lead to moderate opinion, and to pave the way towards a ;,new deal&quot; for Indians.As the Government of India themselves appreciate there arelimits to what in the present  state of political opinion inSouth Africa the Field Marshal&apos;s Government can achieve,  endHis Majesty&apos;s Government feel  that perhaps much more would

have &quot;been gained by accepting under dignified protest even a half measure than resorting to action&apos;and language which maywell &quot;shock sober opinion in the Union, &quot;besides activelyencouraging anti-Indian elements to more reactionary views.4.      His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that the Governmentof India are fully competent to apply the measures already taken under the Reciprocity Act,  and to give notice of thetermination of the Trade Agreement, and they presume that theeffect upon Indian traders and the Indian community generally in South Africa of an interruption of the considerable  exporttrade thereto has been carefully weighed.      But whileregretting the action already taken they feel bound to make itclear that in fulfilment of their paramount duty to prosecutethe war to a  speedy and victorious conclusion they could not and would not approve the enforcement,  after the expiry of theTrade Agreement, of prohibitions on the import from SouthAfrica of materials such as wattle bark which are required for essential war pur-poses and which cannot be procured from other sources either at all or  without serious disarrangement ofshipping programmes or existing financial arrangements.5.      To that extent,  therefore, His Majesty&apos;s Government areunable to  support the Government of India in giving full effectto the retaliatory measures proposed.      The action taken bySouth African legislatures is not one in which we can intervene.We are, however, asking the United Kingdom High commissioner to make known to the Union authorities our anxieties as tothe effect of this deplorable dispute and our concern lestits consequences should prejudice the common war effort.    Inthe circumstances we do not think that the requirements ofthe situation call for the visit to London of the delegationsuggested in paragraph 6 of your telegram.

Draft telegram to the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in South AfricaSECRETNo.Your telegram No.  1198 of 9th November.      Arngrateful to you for report of your very useful talk withG-eneral Smuts about the Indian question.      Substance of paragraphs 2 and 3 is being communicated by Secretary ofState for India to the Viceroy for his personal information.2. Present position is that Government of India have informed United Kingdom Government officially of intentionto give notice of termination of trade agreement between Indiaand South Africa,  and have asked us to do everything possibleto enable them to make this intention effective.      They havestated that until views of United Kingdom Government are known notice of termination will not be given to UnionGovernment and views&apos; and intentions of Government of india will not.be made public.      They add that,  if it would assist us,  they are prepared to send delegation of members of council to London to discuss problem.3. In my immediately following telegram I am repeating.,for your own information only,  official reply which is being sent to Government of India.h. We much appreciate steps which General Smutscontemplates to alleviate present unfortunate situation.      as you will see from reply to Government of India,  we are notprepared formally to intervene with Union Government.      At   -the same time as we are bringing pressure to bear on      &quot;K   &apos;Government of India to reduce scope of trade embargo, whichthey contemplate,  Government of India can reasonably expectus to use our good offices with Union Government on India&apos;behalf.      I am,., therefore,   sending following personal message to General Smuts which you should let him have informally,preferably at a personal interview.BEGINS.We much regret difficult situation which has arisen between India and Union and which has disappointed hopes thatwe had formed of durable settlement as a result of your welcomeintervention at Pretoria meeting last April.     We express noopinion on contention of Government of India that agreementthen reached has not been honoured in the letter by the Natallegislation. &apos;   But we are naturally concerned at the serious effect of a dispute between two countries of the BritishCommonwealth at a time like this - a dispute of which theconsequences may have a material effect on the war effort.We have felt bound to inform Government of India that wecould not acquiesce in application of trade embargo, for which

there appears to be public demand in India,   on imports fromUnion which are  regarded as essential war supplies.      Weare confident that you, for your part, will do whateveryou can to find early solution for this unhappy difference.We were very glad to hear from our High Commissioner in theUnion of his conversation with you on the 3th November inwhich you outlined steps&apos; which yod proposed to take.      Ican only add how fully we appreciate your difficulties and how grateful we are for your efforts. &quot;   ENDS.

Iu-CYPHER TELEGRAM from the Government of India, commonwealth relations Department, to the Secretary of State for Indie,dated hth November, fi19Udx.1U273Our telegram No.  13892 of 26th. October.      South Africa.Council considered on 1st and 2nd November Union Governmentsreply to our Note (see &quot;Viceroy &apos;s telegram 2007-S of30th October)  and further action to be  taken.2.      Council held that India has most  serious grievanceagainst Union.      Treatment of Indians in South Africa is subject on which all parties and communities in thiscountry are united.      The feeling that Indian interests andhonour are at stake is intensely strong.      It is shared to full by Council and could not be disregarded by any indian government.      The Pretoria Agreement though far from perfectwas accepted in India as a working compromise,  but UnionGovernment have failed to implement it,  and the new NatalOccupation Ordinance which has the Union Governmentssupport contravenes it in important respects.      The question-for Council to decide was not whether action should be taken against the Union,  since action can no longer be deferred,but what action &quot;will be appropriate and effective in war conditions.      The Government of India must clearly reply to-Union Government Note.      In addition the possibilities were(a) to notify a direction in respect of Union under Section 3of the Reciprocity Act,  1943 ?   as amended by Reciprocity(Amendment) Act,  1943 and to make rules specifyingdisabilities to be imposed on Union Nationals in british india;    (b)    to give three months&apos; notice of termination oftrade agreement,   to be followed by stoppage of exports .to end imports from Union;    (c)    to deprive South African&quot;nationals of &apos;privileges enjoyed by them as European British-subjects under Code of Criminal Procedure, I898;    and (d)    towithdraw the High Commissioner.3.      Council decided unanimously not to pursue  (c) and (d).Amendment Code of Criminal Procedure even if practicablewould be ineffective and not worth making.      Withdrawal of high Commissioner would leave Government of India without first hand advice on .South African affairs and worseningconditions for Indian community.      It was recognised thatUnion Government might later demand his withdrawal.h*      There remained (a)  and (b).      On (a)    Council held thatthere could be no possible- bbjection to immediate directionunder Section 3 of Reciprocity Act.      This would merely placeSouth Africans in India under same disabilities in princeple as Indians in South Africa.      Lctual disabilities would then have to be ascertained in detail and imposed by rule.      Atpresent South African nationals affected would admittedly bevery small,  but use of Act would have some moral value.      On(b) Council held that stoppage of trade was most powerful

weapon available.      Without it termination of &quot;trade agreement would mean little.      But effect of a stoppage on war effort of United Nations must be considered and notice of terminationshould not be given until IIis Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s views had been ascertained.      India needs wattle bark andextract,  explosives,  black copper rods,  copper wire and copperwire bars, fluorspar,  calcium carbide, Congo gum,  diamonds andgold from or via South Africa and may later need South Africancoal.      South Africa also supplies mules for the army.      Thereare alternative  sources for most of these requirements,  but whether they can be opened to India and when is a different matter.      Conversely South Africa needs from India cotton piecgoods and yarn,   jute goods, ground nuts,  paraffin wax,  tea,linseed oil,  sheepskins end leather.      The effect of stoppage of these exports on supply allocations and shipping arrange-ments might be  important.      Council considered India. rseconomic relations with South Africa should&quot;be reduced toabsolute minimum and that India&quot;is entitled to sympathy andgood offices of his Majestyrs Government  in this matter.5.      Council noted that 6th November had been allotted fora full day&apos;s debate in the Assembly on South and east african grievances.6.      Council finally took the following decisions:-(1)    The reply contained in our immediately succeedingtelegram should be despatched to- Union Government.(2)    k direction under Section 3 of Reciprocity Act shouldbe notified forthwith,, to be followed by notification of appropriate Rules when details have been worked out.&apos;(3)    His Majesty&apos;s Government should be informed ofGovernment of India&apos;s intention to give notice of terminationof Trade Agreement,  and requested to do everything possibleto enable the Government of India to make this intentioneffective.      The Government of India do not put their  justgrievance before the  joint war effort,  but feel that they areentitled to synpathy and good offices of His majesty&apos;s government in dealing with a controversy fomented by Union-Government on which Indian opinion is so strong.      They feelthat obligations of Union Government to do nothing to impede the common cause are as groat as their own.    Until views ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government are known notice ,of termination &apos;should not be given to Union Gover.nment,  and views and intentions of Government of India should not be made public.If it would assist His Majesty&apos;s Government the Governmentof India are prepared to send a delegation of members of council to London r.c discuss the problem.7*      We shall be grateful for comments.Viceroy has seen.  -
