This would ease hisdifficulties with his Council.   His recommendation is thatthe first three paragraphs as originally approved shouldbe addressed to him in a private telegram, on his assur-ance that he would do his best to convey their substanceto his Council.The Viceroy has also asked for a small amendment tobe made to the original text of paragraph 4 of the tele-gram to make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government might feel obliged, to intervene to prevent prohibition of exports from India to South Africa as well as in an embargo on .South African imports into India,   The wordsamended are underlined in Appendix A.The Dominions Secretary agrees to these alterations;I am anxious to ease the difficulties of the Viceroyin handling the Indian members of his Council who are moreunited on this than on any other matter.

APPENDIX ADRAFT TELEGRAM from Secretary of State to&apos; Viceroy..  Commonwealth Relations Department telegram of the4th November, 14273,   South Africa.   His Majesty^Government realise depth of feeling in India on SouthAfrican problem, and pressure brought to bear on government of India from all quarters to retaliate againstSouth Africao   India has made a magnificent contribution,to common cause, and ELrhGovernment recognise the desire of Government of India, that their resentment against afellow member of the British Commonwealth should notdiminish that contribution,,   In present conditions H.M.Government have no doubt that an open rupture between india and South Africa would hamper British war effort,and they ask Government of India to exercise greatestforbearance and if possible to refrain from going beyondthe measures that have been already taken.   The SouthAfrican Government have difficulties of their own and are under pressure as acute as that applied to the Governmentof India,   Government of India have shouldered readily inthe past the burdens of war and HJvLCL are confident thatIn this extremely difficult matter they will put immediatewar needs first.     In doing so it may well be that theywill serve best interests of Indian community in SouthAfrica, for in the present state of feeling action may/ betaken which both parties to dispute will later regret; -20     IP Mo Government recognise that the Government of india are fully competent to apply the measures already taken under the Reciprocity Act, and to give notice of thetermination of the Trade Agreement, and they presume thatthe effect upon Indian traders and the Indian communitygenerally in South Africa of an interruption of the considerable export trade thereto has been carefullyweighed.   But while regretting the action already takenthey feel found to make it clear that in fulfilment oftheir paramount duty to prosecute the war to a speedy andvictorious conclusion they could not and would not approve the taking by the Government of India after the denunciat^ion of the trade agreement&quot; of executive.auction designed to.inLefTereT&quot; or. likely to resPPIlfPm interference, with theiPpw ofmaterials imported into&quot;or exported mom Indiawnich are&quot; required for essential war purposes arid whichoannot be procured from other sources either at all or without serious-disarrangement of shipping programmes orexisting financial arrangements.5.

APPENDIX. MOUTWARD TELEGRAMPOL. 7881Ait OXOJ,    - CITHER TELEGRAM (OTP),Erpm:   : secre dear.y&apos;-pf State.To :       , Viceroys    v&apos;Dated;    22nd November, 1944-MOST IM^lBDIATB       -&apos;.:.; , . - -26484.:.;&apos;;--     ...     -. - - &apos; &quot;&apos;Commonwealth Relations Department telegram of the 4thNovember , 14273.     south Africa.     His Majedty*s &apos; Government.&apos;have noted with great regret that the Government&quot;of: India have feltcompelled to resert to retaliation against South Africa in -con-sequence of the proceedings in the Natal:-legislature&apos;.     quite apart fro?,-, the unfortunate effect of an open rupture between two units ir.. the British Commonwealth of Nations,-and theprejudicial effects it may have on the conduct&apos;-of the war, areyou really convinced&apos; that the differences, which I fully recognise,between the- Pretoria- Agreement and the Natal Ordinance, are yet&apos;of such a fundamental character as to call for the extreme measureswhich you have proposed? ;-&apos;-2 . While not attempting to pronounce on the relation of the ordinance passed by the Natal Assembly to the Pretoria Agreement,His Majesty&apos;s Government feel compelled to ask the Government ofIndia to recall the circumstances which led to .the Pegging &quot;Act,particularly the disastrous second sroome;report the evidenceof which points clearly to the responsibility of certain richIndians who deliberately broke the Agreement made by Field marshal smuts on his withdrawal of the Hertzog proposals in 1939.     The actionof these Indians, to which little or no- publicity seems to havebeen given in India, is all the more regrettable in vievi of thedistinctly favourable tenor of Broome&apos;s first report, and in justice to South Africa His Majesty&apos;s Government think that even at thislate hour some attempt should be made in India to place at leastpart of the responsibility for the present -impasse on the shouldersof the men v/hose deliberate evasion of the 1939 Pact led to therevelations which were the immediate cause of the lagging Act.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot but feel that the measures already taken by the Government of India-, and the tone of the AssemblyDebate, are hardly calculated in the long run to improve the positionof Indians in&apos; the Union.   On the contrary, they seem likely greatly to hinder the progress, though admittedly it was slow, which hadtill recently been made towards a solution of the most-difficultIndian problem in the Empire.     As the Government of India are aware,after the Pegging Act was passed a solid mass of vocal South AfricanjEuropean opinion emerged which favoured a more liberal Indianpolicy in respect of both housing and the franchise.     His Majesty&apos;sGovernment fear that the present action of the Government of Indiamay now not only alienate that opinion but even render it activelyhostile.     in particular&apos; they deeply regret the reported personalattacks on Field Marshal Smuts in the Assembly Debate, for morethan anyone else the Field Marshal has endeavoured to give a lead to moderate opinion, and to pave the wa3&apos; towards a &quot;newdeal&quot; forIndians.     As the Government of India themselves appreciate there ./are
are limits to what in the present state of political opinion   . -..in south Africa the Field Marshal!s Government can achieve,  andHis Majesty&apos;s Government feel that perhaps much more wouldhave been gained by accepting under dignified protest even a half measure than resorting to action and language which maywell shock sober opinion in the Union, besides activelyencouraging anti-Indian elements to more reactionary views.4- Kis Majesty&apos;3 Government recognise that the Governmentof India are fully competent to apply the measures already taken under the Reciprocity Act, and to give notice of thetermination of the Trade Agreement,  and they presume that theeffect upon Indian traders and the Indian community generally in south Africa of an interruption of the considerable exporttrade thereto has been carefully weighed .     But whileregretting the action already taken they feel bound to make itclear that in.fulfilment of their paramount duty to prosecutethe war to a speedy and victorious conclusion they could not and would not&apos;approve the enforcement, after, the expiry of theTrade Agreement, of prohibitions on the import from SouthAfrica of materials such as wattle bark which are required for essential Avar purposes and which cannot be procured from other,sources either at all or without serious disarrangement ofshipping programmes or existing financial arrangements.5- To&quot; that extent,  therefore, His Majesty1s Government are&apos;unable to support the Government of India in giving full effectto the retaliatory measures proposed.     The action taken bySouth African legislatures is not one in which we can interveneV.re are, however, asking the United Kingdom High commissioner to make known to the union authorities our anxieties as to the&apos;effect of this deplorable dispute and our concern lest itsconsequences should prejudice the common war effort.     in thecircumstances we do not think that the requirements ofthe situation call for the visit to London of the delegationsuggested in paragraph 6 of your telegram.
