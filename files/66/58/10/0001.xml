All branches of the Civil Defence Services are now being reduced inaccordance with the diminishing risk of enemy air attack, and the time is comingwhen the Government must make a statement on the future of Civil Defenceafter hostilities in Europe have ceased.2. The provisional conclusions which I have reached as to future organisa-tion are set out in this Paper. They were examined by the. Civil DefenceCommittee at a recent meeting (C.D.C. (44) 25th Meeting) and met with general approval.3. My proposals will be better followed by Ministers who are not acquainted with the detailed organisation of the Civil Defence Services if I preface myconstructive proposals by a short explanation of the present system.Present Organisation.4. The Civil Defence (General) Services, which are the services with whichthis memorandum is primarily concerned, derive from the obligations of localauthorities under Regulations made under the Air Raid Precautions Act, 1937,to prepare general schemes making provision, inter alia, for the reporting ofair raid casualties and damage, for the organisation of services of wardens, andfor arrangements for dealing with casualties. Except that a Civil DefenceRegional Reserve has been created (consisting of mobile columns trained in firstaid, rescue work and decontamination), the greater part of its members nowbeing employees of the Crown and not of a local authority, and that first-aidparties have been amalgamated with the Rescue Services, the local organisation ofthe Civil Defence (General) Services is still on the lines of the Regulations madeunder the Act of 1937. In short, there are 250 scheme-making authorities in GreatBritain who are still responsible, under the general guidance of the GovernmentDepartments concerned, for the organisation and control of the Services. Inbetween the headquarters of the Departments and the local authorities themselves the Regional Commissioners have, however, successfully carried out important,co-ordinating duties and much of the detailed administration of the central departments has been devolved to them.5. The war has also necessitated the creation, alongside the generalServices, of the Fire Guard, which is organised partly under the local authori-ties and partly under a variety of &quot; appropriate authorities&quot; GovernmentDepartments, &amp;c.6. The other main services with Civil Defence functions are the police and fire services, but they differ from the above mentioned in having normal peace-time responsibilities.Future.7.   The Civil Defence Services will cease to have any active role to performimmediately the European war is over, if not earlier.   In this they differ from,   the Armed Forces, and a decision on their future ought not, therefore, to wait*-  until similar decisions have to be taken as regards the latter.   In default of a clear lead from the Government the Civil Defence Services will disintegrate,the responsibilities which will remain with the local authorities under the 1937Aot will become a dead letter amidst the more pressing claims of reconstruction,and the experience and enthusiasm of officers and members will be lost.-[28688]
8. In my view it would be wrong that the Government should adopt a negative attitude and let things take their own course. The decision taken nowwill be of lasting importance and, should a war involving these islands againthreaten with little warning, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to rebuild a- Civil Defence organisation if all continuity with the present organisation is lost and the decision is deferred1 as it was before the present war until the threatis imminent.9. It is, I think, generally agreed (i) that Civil Defence, however organised,will be an essential fourth arm in any future war, and (ii) that at any rate fora long period the Armed Forces must be kept in a state of efficiency andreadiness for war. The Chiefs of Staff, in another connection, have told methat &quot;it is safe to assume for planning purposes that a Civil defence organisation will be an essential part of the country&apos;s post-war defence system.&quot;There can be no question for some undefined years to come of total militarydisarmament, and--as a corollary of this there should be no total abolition ofCivil Defence. This view is confirmed by such indications as we already have including flying bombs and rockets in their infancy- iof the likely nature of any future war involving these islands. We must be prepared for attacks both from aircraft and land installations launched from great distances and on a scalegreater than any we have so far experienced, and we cannot rely upon the relatively long period of warning which preceded the present war.10. In relation to this question and for that matter to the question of thefuture of the Armed Forces it may be argued by some that it is wrong even tothink of warlike preparations, because this presupposes that the measures for theprevention of future wars will be abortive, and that it would be unwise tomaintain Civil Defence Services after the war, since to do so would undermineconfidence in the efficacy of any world security organisation. What is more, evenif the maintenance of Armed Forces could be justified on the ground that theycould be used to support the world organisation in maintaining peace, to keepthe Civil Defence Services continuously in being would be regarded as tanta-mount to organising the nation on a war basis.I would give two answers to any argument of this kind : (a) We are visualising an international organisation for the prevention ofwar and the use by this organisation of all methods up to and including force. Each nation must be prepared to make its contribu-tion to the force available for this purpose, and Britain must not bebehind in this respect. This involves readiness for warlike operations,including readiness in civil defence for the possibility of retaliationor even anticipatory action by the aggressor, and to neglect adequatepreparations to enable us to discharge our responsibilities in the new international order would be to hamper rather than to further thepreservation of peace. The protection of peace will, I trust, become an active and not a passive matter.(b) It would be unwise to exclude the possibility that the proposed machineryfor the defence of peace will prove inadequate, and until the contraryhas been shown by experience this must be taken into account by peaceful Nations in framing their defence policies. The developmentof weapons like the rocket and the flying bomb increases the risk of surprise attacks by nations with aggressive intentions, and against thepossibility of such attacks civil defence preparations would be anelementary precaution, carrying with it no aggressive implications.Now is the time to face these issues. To fear them, to postpone their con-sideration, will increase rather than decrease any political difficulties which may arise.Let the peaceful- nations pass from a bravely fought war to a bravelyprotected peace.,   And if it be asked : Why should Civil Defence be the first to raise com-^prehensively these issues of future preparedness, I would answer that it is perhapsbecause Civil Defence will be the first out of this war and the first to be at &quot; actionstations&apos;&apos; in any further trouble.11. We must therefore, I suggest, so organise in peace-time that civil defence Services adequate in scale and efficiency to the probable demands upon them can so far as .is possible be mobilised at what may be very short notice.It may well be that the kind of organisation which will be required in anotherwar will be very different from the present organisation. ,But this is not a reason for letting matters drift.   Whatever the organisation, the services which
will have to be performed will be essentially the same -the extinction andprevention of fires, first-aid and medical treatment, rescue,&apos; post-blitz services,and so on.12. The central responsibility for Civil Defence planning and research andfor co-ordinating and directing Civil Defence preparations would naturally rest with the HomeOffice, as the Department concerned with the two main peace-timeservices with Civil Defence functions police and fire and as the likely residuarylegatee of the Ministry of Home Security. (In this connection see the proposal in the Report of the Chairman of the Machine^fof Government Committee onthe War-time Departments (W.P. (44) 482).) It should be the duty of the HomeOffice to keep on top of technical developments affecting Civil Defence and intouch with our defence policy generally, and for this purpose it seems to meessential that, on a similar footing to the Service Ministers, the Home secretary should be associated with the Committee of Imperial Defence or its post-warcounterpart. The Home Office should have its Civil Defence Staff College andits Training School or Schools. Other Departments e.g., the Ministry of Health,Scottish Office and the Ministry of Works would, of course, continue to beresponsible for Civil Defence in relation to matters within their province, but,on the same principle as that under which the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security has acted as Chairman of the Civil Defence Committee, theHome Office would be responsible for co-ordination and for advising GovernmentDepartments generally and, where necessary, other public bodies, industry andthe general public.The Regional organisation of the Ministry of Home Security would cometo an end, subject to plans being ready for its re-establishment in case ofemergency. From this standpoint the special position of Scotland might or might not require in a future war different arrangements from those whichhave operated in this war. This will be considered with the Secretary of State.The whole system of Civil Defence control and report services, including tele-communications and messenger services, would need re-examination and perhapsre-planning in the light of the functional re-grouping of the services suggestedbelow. Methods of co-ordinating the passive defence arrangements in industrial establishments with the public Civil Defence Services during the post-war period in order to ensure the possibility of rapid expansion and mutual support wouldalso need further study in the light of the developments which have taken place during the war.13. The question of the appropriate local organisation is more difficult.Certainly there would require to be designated local authority officers (notnecessarily devoting all-their time to the-subject) concerned with training and being kept up-to-date by the Home Office on Civil Defence problems.It is impossible to forecast the type of organisation which a future war willdemand, and the volume of work to be done in the interval, once the organisation has been put on a peace-time footing, would make it uneconomical to retain the somewhat elaborate system which exists at present or administrative and other staff on anything like the present scale. It has been argued that the presentsystem of local authority control involves too much persuasion and co-ordination,and too little command; that the Regional Commissioners have responsibilitywithout authority; and that in war there is a strong case for transferring theCivil Defence Services from the local authorities to the Central Government andfor concentrating more of the central control in a single Department. On the otherhand, both because as a whole the local authorities have risen admirably to their responsibilities, and because it is important to maintain local interest in what is essentially a citizens&apos; service, I should be opposed to the general transfer of their responsibilities to the State.14. I think that the best course will be to deal with the matter on the basisof the functions which in any event civil defence wall have to perform and to attach the responsibility for particular functions to services or authorities withrelated peace-time functions. Thus, war-time fire fighting and, generally-speaking, fire prevention would, naturally, fall to the fire service (whether this is organised nationally or locally is in this respect immaterial); the health authorities would be responsible for casualty services; the rescue service mightbe attached either to the fire service or to the local authorities, and the post-blitzservices to the local authorities; the wardens&apos; service might remain with the localauthorities it is often at present under the control of the Chief Constable, andmight remain so in such cases. The Home Office would be responsible for preparing paper plans for the creation of swift-moving mobile columns in emergency.
15. There is room for argument about the precise allocation of the differentfunctions and this would be a matter for discussion with the local authorities. Ido not think that the Cabinet need be concerned with the details, and all thatI ask them to approve is the proposal that, under the central direction of theHome Office as outlined above, the responsibility for civil defence in its differentaspects should be allocated to the various services and authorities with relatedpeace-time functions, as seems most appropriate after discussion with the localauthorities and the other Ministers concerned. I see no reason to expectdifficulties on the part of the local authorities, and it is better to begin thediscussions with them in the near future rather than at some indefinite period after the war; for thereby we shall get the advantages of suitable continuity and avoid the disadvantages of a fresh &apos;&apos; start up &quot; in quieter and more normal times.The proposals in this Paper do not involve any transfer of local authorityresponsibilities to the Central Government and would not prejudice their position in any way; while local authorities will welcome the demobilisation of theCivil Defence Regions. The peace-time cost should not be an important factor,but local authorities will no doubt raise the question of reimbursement in the placeof grant-in-aid for those services, the cost of which is not already reimbursed.I myself would envisage in peace-time a system of grant-in-aid, generallyspeaking on the lines provided by the Civil Defence Acts, but the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer would naturally wish to reserve his position until the discussions with the local authorities have taken place and I am able to make more specific proposals.16. The Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland, who,next to the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security, are most directly concerned&apos; with Civil Defence, support my proposals, and would be associatedwith me in the discussions which I wish to undertake with the local authorities, sothat the particular interests of these two Departments may be taken into account.M an-Power.17. I have not dealt in this memorandum with the question of man-power,because I doubt whether at this stage it can be usefully considered except in very general terms.&apos; An important question in this connection is whether it is decidedto maintain a system of national service after the war. If there is nationalservice, it would be appropriate that this should include civil defence training,and the Civil Defence Services of the future would be able to draw upon men sotrained in their period of national service (and women, if national service appliedto them) in the older age groups and the lower medical categories, subject to asufficient number of fit men in the younger age groups being available for, e.g., the fire and rescue services.The extent to which it will be possible to obtain volunteers (whether fromex-members of the wartime civil defence services or otherwise) is difficult to fore-cast, but the experience of the Special Constabulary after the last war suggeststhat, provided that the demands upon them are not excessive, volunteers shouldbe forthcoming in the numbers required. These need not be large, because all thatwill be necessary will be a nucleus of trained persons around whom the service canbe rapidly expanded. The number of paid personnel required should be quitesmall, since the responsibility for administration will rest with the services and authorities whose civil defence obligations, in the main, will be subordinate totheir primary functions.Summary of Proposals.18.-(a) Under the central direction of the Home Office the post-warresponsibility for Civil Defence in its different aspects should, sofar as possible, be allocated to the various services and authorities with related peace-time functions, as seems most appropriate after discussion with the local authorities and the other Ministers concerned.(b) Discussions with the local authorities on the detailed application of thepolicy should start as soon as convenient.(c) The Government^ intentions should be announced.in Parliament at asuitable opportunity.19.   I ask my colleagues for authority to proceed with these proposals.H. M.Home Office and Ministry of Home SecurityWhitehall, S.W. 1,20th November, 1944.
