THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&apos;Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 691.25th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.SPAIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith, in connexion with W.P. (44) 665, a despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires at Madrid enclosing a translation of a letter from General Franco to the Duke of Alba.A. E.Foreign Office, 25th November, 1944.Mr. Eden to Mr. Bowker (Madrid).&apos; (No. 495.)Sir, Foreign Office, 21st November, 1944.WHEN the Spanish Ambassador came to see me this afternoon he said thatthe principal purpose for his visit was to give me a copy of a personal letter which General Franco had given to him. His Excellency said that he would also give me a translation of the letter, though he would not vouch for it in allparticulars. The Ambassador went on to grumble a bit at Franco&apos;s method of expressing himself. His Excellency continued that he-knew that General Francohoped that the Prime Minister and I would both read the letter and let him have our views upon it.2. Having read the letter, I said that this was clearly a document uponwhich I should not be willing to make comments without further consideration ofits contents and without consultation with the Prime Minister. The Ambassadorsaid that he quite understood this. At the same time could I give him, not for transmission to Madrid, some personal reaction on the document ? I said that, on first reading, my comment could only be that the letter revealed a state of mindwhich was out of touch with the realities of the present world situation. the ambassador did not attempt to dispute this, but added that he thought that theopportunity was a good one for us to send any answer that we felt like sending.We now had full justification for doing this in view of the letter.I am, &amp;c.ANTHONY EDEN.Enclosure.(Translation.)My dear Ambassador and friend,THE purpose of this letter is to convey to you in a direct, frank and sinceremanner my thoughts and those of the Spanish people on the subject of ourrelations with Great Britain, so that you may transmit them faithfully and withequal frankness to our good friend, the British Prime Minister.The grave European situation, and the role that Great Britain and Spainwill be called upon to play in the future concert of Western Europe, make itdesirable that we should clarify our relations, dismissing from them the seriesof claims, counter-claims and petty incidents that during the last two years havemarred our friendship.12585   [28693] .   ../Copy No.-
The noble words that the Prime Minister recently addressed to Spain, withsuch good effect upon her public opinion-words that were consistent with that other &quot;gesture of his youth, when he so courageously served in the Spanish ranks-are a guarantee that this disquiet of ours will be appreciated by him.I consider it very logical that until now great discrepancies should have arisen between the British and Spanish trend of thought. Spain is freer, asbefits a neutral country, of commitments and passion; but with the progress ofthe war the identity of interests and concern for the future are taking a more definite shape, and this is revealed in speeches, statements and commentariesabout the Prime Minister&apos;s journeys.Because we cannot believe in the good faith of Communist Russia, and because we know the insidious might of Bolshevism, we must regard thedestruction or severe weakening of her neighbouring States as merely whettingher appetite for power and ambition and thus rendering more necessary than ever an intelligent understanding between the countries of Western Europe.Events in liberated Italy and the grave situation in France where theGovernments orders are ignored, the &quot; maquisards &quot; brazenly proclaim their aim of establishing the French Sovietic Republic, and for this they claim thesupport of the U.S.S.R.&apos; speak for themselves.On the other hand, history teaches us. that theories of eternal peace anddisinterested friendship are inevitably doomed to failure; these generous con-exceptions cannot, therefore, mean for us anything but elusive and unattainableideals.With an annihilated Germany, and Russia having asserted her hegemonyin Europe and Asia, and the U.S.A. having consolidated their power in the atlantic and Pacific Oceans as the mightiest nation of the world, the european countries in a disintegrated Continent will have to face the direst and most dangerous crisis of their history.I realise that reasons of immediate military importance prevent responsibleEnglishmen commenting upon this aspect of the universal struggle; yet this isthe truth and the threat has not been averted.After the terrible ordeal that the European nations have endured, threenations have revealed themselves, among those of greater population and resources, as the strongest and most virile : Great Britain, Germany, and Spain.Rut with Germany once destroyed, there is only one country to which Great Britaincan turn her attention Spain. The French and Italian defeats and their processof internal disintegration will make it impossible, probably for many years,to build up anything stable upon their foundations. To do so would bring thesame tragic surprises that Great Britain and Germany have suffered in thepresent conflict.The deduction is obvious : What is the interest of Great Britain and Spainbut their mutual friendship ? I do not hesitate to affirm this, and the greater the destruction of Germany the more indispensable this friendship will be.Once this necessity established, let us examine our present relations withGreat Britain, and this will lead us to admit that they are far from bright.In spite of the noble utterances of the Prime Minister and the good disposition of our Government, there are no signs that the atmosphere of distrust and hostilityin Great Britain towards Spain has abated, and this creates its natural defensivereaction in the various Spanish circles. Neither the press nor the British Wirelesshave ceased their periodical attacks on Spain, on her system of government, andeven on her ruler. The attacks are sometimes in acid and ill-mannered terms,other times with captious and insidious comment.This hostility is still more important when it is&apos; voiced by official elements,or when attempts are made to justify it on ideological grounds. This is the morestriking in the case of a country like Great Britain that has a long . tradition of understanding, throughout her history, of the furthest peoples of the worldwithout regard for their systems of government or ideologies. This aspect, thatseems to imply an interference in domestic affairs, provokes the anger of all goodSpaniards, and has regrettable consequences in the country.Great Britain ought not to forget that present relations are the logicalconsequence of those that have existed in the past, while those of the future will be determined by those we may now maintain.I think the British Government should be told that the activities of theirsecret and propaganda services have had throughout the last five years a detri-mental effect on our relations; they have antagonised the nation&apos;s strongest andmost sensitive elements, like the Army, the Police and the Falange, with its threemillions of active members.  I can say positively that nothing, from plot to minor
disorder, has been discovered during these years which has not, in some way orother, been traced to British agents. The Spanish State had no alternative butopposition to foreign underground activities, and the very important part playedin their discovery and prosecution by the three elements I have mentioned has created a hatred of foreign agents and a natural indignation amongst our own people.It is advisable that they should know in London that we have not overlookedany of their foreign political or diplomatic activities affecting or concerningSpain. Even those matters which they may have considered of the most intimateand secret nature have come providentially to our knowledge, but the SpanishState, with a clear vision of the future and of her traditional interests, hasavoided as much as.possible their publicity and the corresponding scandal.Another circumstance that might well be brought to their knowledge is thatthe circles which, in my opinion, have supplied information to the British propa-ganda have been from the most frivolous and inefficient Spanish elements. I fear,therefore, that the news or opinions that Great Britain may have about our country must be false or distorted.Taking all this into account, I have deemed it necessary, in view of the futurenecessities of both our countries, to try to clarify our relations in an endeavour to free them from a biased and hostile atmosphere, which is incompatible with asincere friendship in the future.This war has completely altered the old conceptions of strategy and powerof nations; everything has increased in dimension, and if the European countrieswant to avoid unpleasant surprises, it is necessary that they should throwoverboard old prejudices and strengthen their continental solidarity.It would be idle to pretend that Spain should now behave against her ownconvictions and try to benefit by. the distress of other countries; to do so wouldbe disregarding the principles of honour which have prevailed throughout allher history and which are summed up in the famous Spanish motto Nobleza obliga;it would nevertheless be right and prudent to aim at strengthening our relations and making possible our future co-operation.It is right to emphasise that Spain is a healthy, virile and chivalrous country with strategic gifts; she has given ample proof of her spiritual reserves and resources of courage and energy; she has the will to exist, without harbouringbase ambitions, loves peace and knows how to keep it; she believes it is in.the interests of Great Britain and Spain that there should be understanding between them; she esteems British favour for its true value, and she knows thevalue of her own favour. She knows that this understanding and future friend-ship is possible, but believes nevertheless that it will not be attained by merewords, unless the basis of mutual relations is entirely changed. There must also be sincerity, good faith and the firm determination to attain mutual under-standing. There must be an end of old jealousies and desire for domination,which lead to prosperity of the one being resented by the other. Making all necessary concessions, we must-bridge the differences which divide us.To conclude : there are exiled Spaniards who speculate and base theirbehaviour on the hope of internal changes in Spain -which are so vague andproblematical that it is idle to discuss their possibility. They believe that whilstserving their own political aims they would thus facilitate the rapprochementwith Great Britain. I think you must explain that any hypothetical changes of this nature would only serve Russia&apos;s interests. In foreign affairs allresponsible Spaniards think alike, and history shows that Spain&apos;s love andfriendship are not difficult to win.After laying bare frankly and faithfully to you my thoughts, it only remainsfor me to entrust to your patriotism and active intelligence the transmission of these sentiments to the man on whose shoulders rests the greatest responsibilityfor the future of Europe.With sincere affection,(Signed) FRANCISCO FRANCO.(Palace of El Pardo, 18th October, 1944.
