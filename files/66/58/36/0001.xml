KTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 686.24th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.EMPLOYMENT  OF  ITALIAN PRISONERS  OF  war memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.AS stated in W.M. (44) 145th Conclusions, Minute 2, I undertook to place before my colleagues a paper on the employment of Italian Prisoners of War.Italian prisoners of war are a most important source of man-power. There are over 140,000 prisoners at work in the country and they are of particular importance to the war effort (1) because they help to make good one of theprincipal deficiencies, viz., the shortage of men suitable&apos; for heavy labouringwork, and (2) because, subject to accommodation difficulties, they are mobile.2. Of the 140,000 Italian prisoners employed, 60,000 were brought herethis year. Just over 100,000 are &quot;co-operators,&quot; that is to say they havevolunteered for employment &quot;on work directly connected with the war effort.&quot;Non-co-operators are confined to a more limited field of employment.3. Generally speaking, the prisoners work well and hard, but the attitudeof a section of the press is detracting from the value of their work which naturallydiminishes in an atmosphere of ill-will. The Press campaign can effect theposition more directly by making it impossible to accommodate the prisoners near the places where they are most urgently needed. The position in this respectis particularly serious in London. There are two reasons for this. First, theman-power position, especially in relation to heavy labouring work, is more serious in London than elsewhere: As will be seen from the extract from theReport dated the 16th October, 1944. of the Inter-department^mental Committee onthe Allocation of Prisoners of War (see Annex), all the six Departments nowemploying prisoners in the London area, totalling some 2,500, express strongly the view that the work on which the prisoners are engaged is essential andargent. There are, moreover, further demands for prisoners, in particular ademand by the Ministry of Food for prisoners for very urgent and essential workon oil seed crushing. I cannot find alternative labour to do the work now beingperformed by the prisoners already in employment in London, nor to undertake the further work for which Departments are asking for additional prisoners.4. The second distinguishing feature of the position in London relates to accommodation. The taking up by Italian prisoners of accommodation inLondon which could otherwise have accommodated Londoners has been a principalfeature of the Press campaign. It has proved possible, at considerable incon-venience and by putting an extra strain on transport facilities, to find alternative accommodation for all prisoners at present employed in the London area. I hopeit may be possible to maintain this position, as I appreciate to the full theimportance in present circumstances of not accommodating Italian prisoners ofwar in houses which might otherwise be used for the accommodation of Londoners.Every effort should be made, as in the past, to find accommodation for the prisoners in premises not suitable for housing Londoners. Such efforts may,however, fail and in those circumstances we are faced with the alternative either of accommodating the prisoners in premises which might otherwise be usedto house Londoners or of failing to get done the urgent work for which they arewanted. In my view, the urgent work must, in such a case, have precedence.[28883]Copy No.
5.   I ask, therefore, for decisions as follows : (1) That the Minister of Information be invited to do what he can to persuade the Press to take a less hostile line towards Italian prisonersdoing useful work in this country.(2) That, where accommodation cannot be found for prisoners required forwork in the London area in places accessible to their work, suchprisoners are to be accommodated in property notwithstanding thatthis could otherwise be used to house Londoners.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,24:th November, 1944.ANNEX.Inter-Departmental Committee on the Allocation oe Prisoners of War.Extract from Report dated the lQth October, 1944.* * * * * *2. The Departments concerned were asked to give their views on a proposal that all Italian prisoner of war labour should be withdrawn from the london area.   These were as follows : (i) The Ministry of War Transport.The Department had at present working for them 1,400 prisoners. They werebeing-used at all the main line railway termini on varied types of work, e.g.,labouring in the engineering departments, loco, sheds, unloading coal, &amp;c. 431,on repairs, &amp;c, to the permanent way 35, engine cleaning 50, coaling 123,portering mail bags, &amp;c- 159, and carriage cleaning 269. The services of the carriage cleaners might be dispensed with if the decision were taken that the&apos; carriages should go dirty, but the Ministry of War Transport would resist atthe highest level the withdrawal of any other of their prisoners from theirpresent work. They hoped, moreover, to secure as soon as possible the servicesof 300 more prisoners of war in the London area, which have been allocated tothem.(ii) Ministry of Supply.280 prisoners were being employed by the Department. A detailed state-ment of the way in which they were employed is in Appendix II. The Ministryof Supply pointed out that although in some cases the work did not enjoy a labour preference, the fact that prisoners of war would be available had beentaken into account in deciding whether a labour preference should be sought anddrew attention to the general shortage of labour for heavy unskilled work of the type for which the Italians were used. The Ministry of Supply would resistat the highest level the withdrawal of the Italians from the- work on which theyare now engaged.(iii) The Admiralty.The Department had at present working for them 105 prisoners. They were employed : (a) 30 at the Naval Stores Dept., Deptford, on loading, and unloading atrailway sidings; and(6) 75 at the Victualling Department, Deptford, loading lorries and lighters.The Admiralty could not contemplate giving up these men as no alternativelabour-was available for this heavy work.(iv) The Ministry of Works.The Department were using about 200 Italians on car-breaking and had lentsome 400 to the Ministry of Home Security for war debris clearance. They had decided that although the clearance of debris and the work of car-breaking were
essential and urgent, that if the houses at present in use for accommodatingprisoners had to be relinquished the work should be postponed in order thatsuch accommodation as was available might be put at the disposal of User Depart-ments who were unable to relinquish their prisoners in the London area..(v) The Ministry of Food.The Department had at present working for them 57 prisoners. They were employed as follows : Bacon Processing  ...       ...       ...       ... ...       ... 14Sterilising Milk Bottles......... ...... 5Cutting Grain for Chaff ...       ...       ... ...       ... 6Beer Canning for the Forces     ...       ... ...       ... 23Baking Bread       ...       ...       ...       ... ...       ... 6Distribution of Orange Juice for Children ...       ... 3The Ministry of Food said that all this work was vital and could not be deferred.The Ministry of Food were very anxious to have also for work in the london area further prisoners to the number of 178 who had already been allocated tothat Department.(vi) The Ministry of Fuel and Power.This Department employed 40 prisoners in the London area, all were atthe Beckton Gas Works and housed in premises provided by the Company onthe site. The question of removing them from this accommodation did not, there-fore, arise. The Ministry of Fuel and Power could not do without the servicesof these men and, indeed, would welcome the allocation of a further 400 prisoners in the London area of whom 200 could be housed in accommodation furnished bythe Gas Undertakings.j7. jt, M. jt. ^J,*7v&quot; &quot;a&quot; tv- -r&quot; -7t &quot;TV
