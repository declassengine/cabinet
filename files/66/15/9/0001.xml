naval SITUATION.General.A Hipper class cruiser has again been located in Brest. Italian shipping has been successfully attacked off Tripoli and at Kismayu.Enemy minelaying aircraft have been active in home waters and in theMediterranean.Shipping losses caused by raider attacks have raised the total tonnage sunk,although losses reported from U-Boat, mine and aircraft are on a small scale.Home.2.   Two cruisers patrolled to southward of Iceland but sighted nothing.H.M. Minesweeping Trawler Stella Rigel shot down an enemy aircraft offHarwich.H.M. Submarine Snapper, overdue from her patrol area in the Bay of Biscay,has been presumed lost.Bombs were dropped in Aberdeen harbour on the 13th, causing little damage,and early in the morning of the 16th a dock pumping station was damaged inChatham Dockyard. The Naval establishment at Skegness was bombed twiceduring the same morning, the second attack causing fairly extensive damage anda few casualties. In a daylight attack by a single enemy aircraft at Invergordonon the 17th a cistern containing 4,000 tons of oil fuel was demolished. On the night of the 17th/18th the Royal Naval Base building at Yarmouth wasdemolished by a direct hit from a bomb and incendiary bombs caused minor damage at the Royal Naval Yard at Deptford. Lowestoft was unsuccessfully attacked at noon on the 19th, and during the evening the Royal Naval Hospital at plymouth was hit and slightly damaged by a direct hit from a small bomb.North Atlantic.3. H.M. Ocean Boarding Vessels on patrol in the Madeira-Canary Islandsarea have intercepted the French ships Richepance (3,485 tons), PLM. 13 (3,754tons) and Lorient (4,185 tons), which are being taken to Gibraltar.Mediterranean.4. Two separate attacks were carried out by H.M. Submarine Truant on anescorted convoy off Tripoli on the 11th. One ship was hit by gunfire and a ship of 3,500 tons was sunk by torpedo. On the 12th H.M. Submarine Utmost attackedan escorted convoy of three ships in the vicinity of Tripoli and obtained a hiton a ship of 8,000 tons, which was last seen with her stern awash. H.M.Submarine Rover, off the south coast of Italy, successfully attacked an enemytanker.During the night of the 13th/14th one Swordfish aircraft with flares andthree with torpedoes attacked a northbound escorted convoy of three or fourmerchant vessels, 120 miles N.N.W. of Tripoli. One probable and one possiblehit were made.On the night of the 15th/16th four Swordfish aircraft attacked and sunk anescorted merchant vessel, believed to be the Italian s.s. Jiiventus (4,920 tons),thirty miles east of Sfax (Tunisia).During the last four weeks attacks by our aircraft and submarines onthe Tripoli-Italy route have resulted in five ships being sunk for certain andtwo probably sunk.   In addition, one struck a mine off the entrance to Tripoli.5. The harbour at Tobruk has now been cleared of mines. Derna can beused by small vessels only. A preliminary survey of Benghazi shows that untilextensive salvage operations are undertaken it can be used only to a limited extent owing to the presence of wrecks of enemy ships and to a breach in thebreakwater from our bombs which admits swell into the harbour.
East Africa.6. Operations in support of British land forces in Italian Somaliland were carried out on the 13th and 14th.On the 13th H.M. Destroyer Kandahar fired three salvos at Kismayu to testwhether the shore batteries were still inactive and H.M.S. Shropshire bombardedMogadishu, where she obtained several straddles on a merchant ship. She alsobombarded motor transport and encampments near Brava. In the morning ofthe 14th coastal batteries at Kismayu and Muanga were bombarded at 2,300 yardsrange, but the enemy made no reply. Kismayu was occupied in the afternoon ofthat day. In the course of this operation H.M. Ships Shropshire and Capetownwere attacked by aircraft from Merka on several occasions without result. Thedetails of enemy shipping captured and sunk is shown later in this resume.Red Sea.7. On the morning of the 13th fourteen aircraft from H.M.S. Formidableattacked the harbour at Massawa. The attack was considerably hampered by fighter opposition. It is probable that one hit was made with a torpedo on a ship lying at a jetty in the Northern Harbour, where a submarine and a supplyship had been reported by reconnaissance, and one merchant ship was sunkoutside, also by torpedo. A second merchant ship was also sunk either by torpedoor bomb. In the bombing attack on the main harbour one probable hit was madeon a large destroyer. Two of our aircraft did not return, one of which made aforced landing 20 miles from Massawa owing to engine trouble-Far East.8. H.M. Transport Queen Mary, with Australian troops, escorted byH.M.S. Durban, arrived at Singapore on the 18th.Enemy Intelligence.German.9. It is now thought that the ship which attacked the convoy 640 miles west of Cape St. Vincent on the 12th February was certainly a Hipper classcruiser. A cruiser of this class was reported in dry dock at Brest by airreconnaissances on the 15th. Further reconnaissances were hampered by bad weather, but the ship was seen again on the morning of the 19th. One destroyerwas also seen in Brest on the 13th.Italian.10. There have been no reconnaissances of the main Italian Naval forces during the past week.Submarines.11. There have been some six or seven German submarines in the North-Western Approaches, and in the earlier part of the week there wTas one betweenthe Azores and the coast of Portugal. There has been little evidence of Italiansubmarines, but it is believed there may have been six or seven at sea on the 18th-Air reconnaissance showed ten submarines at Lorient on the 15th.Far Eastern Intelligence./ apan.12. In the latter part of January the Japanese forces in south Chinesewaters were reinforced by one battleship, five cruisers, two aircraft carriers, and twelve destroyers. Some of the cruisers and destroyers have been making useof Kamranh Bay (south-eastern Indo-China).[22245] b
Netherlands East Indies.13. The Naval Forces in the Netherlands East Indies comprise two 6-inch cruisers, one flotilla leader, five destroyers, eleven submarines, five M.T.B.&apos;s anda number of minelaying and minesweeping craft. In addition to these, the cruiser Sumatra, two destroyers and four submarines are refitting or otherwiseout of commission.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.14. Fourteen ships and five small craft, a total of 91,127 tons, have beenreported lost by enemy action; of these all but three ships (29,619 tons) were british. Three of these ships and three small craft were sunk during the period under review. Four British ships (23,833 tons) were sunk by U-boats, three inthe North-Western Approaches and one to the westward of Cape St. Vincent.Two steam trawlers (432 tons) were sunk by mines, four steam trawlers (1,385 tons)by aircraft, and nine ships (65,477 tons) by raider; five of the latter were in thehome-bound convoy attacked on the 12th. Of this convoy, which consisted ofnineteen ships, ten certain and two probable are reported safe, which leaves two more which are probably sunk. Sixteen British ships are reported damaged.During the week enemy aircraft have continued to attack convoys on the east coast and in the North-Western Approaches as far north as Cape Wrath. Detailsof ships sunk and damaged are shown in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.15. During the week ended noon, Wednesday, the 19th February, 842 ships,including 155 allied and 13 neutral, were convoyed, of which one was lost by enemy action. One battleship. 2 cruisers, 7 armed merchant cruisers, 35 destroyers and 39 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duty.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy this week totalled 933,382 tons,twice as much as the amount imported last week. Twenty-eight tankers brought in 284,127 tons of oil compared with only 43,139 tons in the previous week.Cereals amounted to 144,478 tons as compared with 60,490 tons. Other food imports totalled 93,840 tons compared with 119,883 tons last week. mineral imports totalled 250,255 tons, the corresponding figure last week being164,208 tons. Timber amounted to 47,849 tons compared with only 4,000 tonslast week. General cargoes and sundries totalled 112,833, more than twice theamount of the previous week. Many aeroplanes and a large number of lorrieswere also imported.British Minelaying.16. On the 14th two M.T.B.&apos;s laid mines off the Belgian Coast. On the 15thH.M. Submarine Cachalot laid fifty mines in West Fjord, and on the 17th and18th H.M. Ships Southern Prince and Port Quebec laid 1,110 mines between the faroes and Iceland. On the 15th and 18th H.M.S. Plover laid 240 mines inSt. George&apos;s Channel. Minelaying by aircraft has taken place off the Norwegian,French Atlantic and Dutch coasts.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.17. On 8 nights during the week enemy aircraft have laid mines, as many as 100 planes operating at a time. The raids have been heaviest off the east coast, particularly off the southern half. Off the South Coast the only places where mines have been dropped are off Torbay and Exmouth. Milford Havenand Liverpool Bay have also been visited.The Humber Minesweepers had a successful day on the 18th, when 30acoustic and five magnetic mines were detonated.   The following day five acoustic
mines were exploded, another seven exploding spontaneously. A fishing trawlerwas sunk by mine that day to the south of the channel.Mines have been detonated during the week as follows : seventeen magneticand sixty-three acoustic.In addition to the two trawlers previously reported as sunk by mine, Unemployment.T.B. was mined and sunk off Harwich and a Paddle Minesweeper was mined and beached off the Tyne.An Oropesa Trawler was bombed and sunk with all hands south-east ofPeterhead.Foreign Waters.18. German minelaying aircraft have been active over the mediterranean and Suez Canal. On the 17th Malta reported that there had been air raids,including minelaying raids, for eleven successive nights. Two mines have beendetonated off Valletta, and two mines are thought to be inside the Grand Harbour.Both these harbours are closed. During the night of the 12th/13th enemy aircraftlaid mines off Benghazi, and a dangerous area has been declared to the north-east of the port. Mines were dropped in the Suez Canal early on the 18th and traffichas been suspended.A contact minefield has been found off Tobruk and has caused four casualties.Out of a number of whalers lying idle at Durban it is hoped to select six and fit them with LL Sweeps for use in the Mediterranean.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.19. Eight loaded German ships are reported to be lying in Oslo Fjord,presumably ice bound.The German-Swedish shipping agreement has been prolonged to July 1941with little alteration except that freights for wood and pulp have been increased.Sweden&apos;s Baltic tonnage will be used for trade with Germany, but not for german trade with other countries.The s.s. Ankara (4,768 tons), which was reported in November and Decemberas being at Trieste fitting out as a transport, is believed to have sailed fromPalermo on the 10th.German ships which were in Kismayu are included under Italian MerchantShipping.Italian.20. Enemy merchant shipping losses in the Mediterranean and Indian Oceanhave recently been heavy, the latter as a result of our operations at Kismayu.There were sixteen ships at Kismayu in January, and so far fourteen havebeen accounted for. Five Italian ships, totalling 28,055 tons, were captured whenthey tried to escape on the 11th February, and all these have now reachedMombasa. The German s.s. Tannenfels (7,840 tons) and s.s. Askari (590 tons)sailed before the 7th February; the former has not so far been reported, but thelatter went ashore south of Brava. The s.s. Uckermark (7,021 tons), which was intercepted when she tried to escape, attempted to scuttle herself and subsequentlysank after being taken in tow. The Italian tanker Marghera (4,531 tons) andthe s.s. Moncalieri (5,723 tons), and two other unidentified ships were scuttledat Kismayu. The Italian tanker Pensilvania (8,861 tons) and the German tugKionga (192 tons) are thought to have gone to Mogadishu.The troopship Garibaldi (5,278 tons) is reported to have been hit in dry dockduring the bombardment of Genoa on the 9th February, and the s.s. Citta diMessina (2,472 tons) is believed to have been sunk on the 15th January offMisurata by H.M. Submarine Regent. Damage caused to shipping in recentattacks in the Mediterranean has already been mentioned in this resume.The New York press reports that negotiations are in progress for the purchaseof 27 Italian ships, including the s.s. Conte Biancamano, 23,255 tons, which arein United States harbours.
MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.21.   The total of identified German divisions is increased by three to 221.Distribution of German divisions.The distribution of German divisions at 1200 hours the 19th February isbelieved to be as follows : ,.     .

Reports continue to be received of the movement of German troops into italy.   No confirmation of these reports, however, has so far been received.Balkan States.Bulgaria.23. The Bulgarians continue to prepare for the entry of German troops into their country.   The programme appears to be as follows : (a) A retaining force of 80,000 Bulgarian troops are to be located on theTurkish frontier.   General mobilisation is now considered unlikely.(&amp;) The remainder of the Bulgarian army is to be distributed throughoutthe country to maintain order. This has become necessary owing tothe widespread dissatisfaction at the prospect of a German entry,especially among the peasants. There is great discontent in the districts where German observation posts have been set up and the behaviour of the German personnel is continually causing incidents.Particular resentment is felt at the German behaviour to women.(c) Roads and bridges are to be put in a fit state to take mechanical transport.(d) Sufficient accommodation is to be arranged and the necessary stores areto be made available.Greece.24. There has been heavy fighting in the Central Sector where the Italianshave been stubbornly resisting the Greek offensive. During these operations the-Greeks have occupied important points on the heights overlooking Tepelenefrom the North-East and inflicted severe losses on the enemy in men and material.Africa.Libya.25. There have been several air raids on Benghazi besides other towns in libya, and one officer and one other rank have been killed. BeyOnd this thereis little to report.
Sudan. . &apos;        ..; ,-.   :.\;, :.]&apos;.::.:26. In the Blue Nile sector units of the Sudan Defence Force have occupiedKurmuk and are operating across the frontier.   The enemy has retired to Asosa.Meanwhile, patriot activities in Abyssinia have increased, particularly in theloop of the Blue Nile south of Lake Tana and in the area east of the Lake. TheEmperor is now in Abyssinia.East Africa. ;.. &quot;&apos; ;   , &apos;;27.   The Italian white troops and Eritreans have been fighting well.Our troops have advanced about 50-60 miles in Abyssinia and are now astride the Mega-Yavello road. A force under General Godwin Austen has occupiedKismayu.Far East.Thailand-Indo-China dispute.28. The Armistice which was signed between Thailand and Indo-China onthe 31st January, and which was originally due to expire on the 11th February,has been extended until 1000 hours on the 25th February. Meanwhile, peacenegotiations in Tokyo continue.There have been reports, however, that the Thais have violated the termsof the Armistice and have advanced into Indo-China in the direction of LuangPrabang. It is possible that this may be an attempt on their part to establish a stronger hold on the territories on the right bank of the river Mekong, whichwill probably form their minimum territorial demands at the peace conferencehow in progress.Convoys.Egypt.29.   The following arrived at Suez on the 16th February : One Regiment &quot;I &quot; Tanks less one Squadron.- One Anti-tank Regiment.One Heavy and two Light A.A. Regiments.One Searchlight Regiment.One New Zealand Field Regiment.One New Zealand Anti-tank Regiment, less two Batteries.Base and L. of C. Units.Drafts.Malaya.30. 22nd Australian Infantry Brigade and attached troops have arrived in Singapore for service in Malaya.AIk SITUATION.General Review. . v31. Adverse weather continued, and Bomber Command operated on two nights only, oil and other plants in the Ruhr being attacked. Sea mining by theenemy is increasing.Enemy aircraft again raided Malta, and mines were laid in the Suez Canal.Two squadrons have been sent from India to reinforce the air strength in malaya.Operational aircraft battle casualties and extracts from recent Raid Assess-ment Reports are given in Appendices VI and VII.Germany and Occupied Territory.32. Bomber Command flew 30 sorties by day and 283 by night (184 on the15th/16th) and Coastal Command 6 by day and 33 by night.[22245] * * c
33. On the night of the 14th/15th oil plants at Horaburg and Gelsenkirchenwere bombed together with the power station and inland port of Duisburg. Onthe following night the same targets were attacked in much better weather andalso the oil plant at Sterkrade Hoi ten.and many aerodromes in Holland. Thirty-seven aircraft also successfully attacked the docks at Boulogne. Coastal command aircraft raided Dunkirk, St. Nazaire, Lorient and Brest during the week.34. By day, Blenheims attacked Calais, Zeebrugge, den Helder, Oostvoorneand Ostend. Two attempts were made without success by aircraft of coastal command to locate and attack the enemy cruiser in Brest, and from one of these,three Beauforts failed to return. Fighter sweeps over northern France were maintained, but on a lighter scale than during last week.United Kingdom.35. During daylight hostile activity was slight. Standing patrols in theStraits and English Channel were maintained on most days and the usual weather and reconnaissance nights were made. On four days, in cloudy weather, enemy aircraft penetrated East Anglia and along the East Coast there were a fewattacks on shipping.   Oil tanks at Invergordon were bombed.36. Enemy activity by night consisted of widespread raids over east anglia, with aerodromes apparently the principal objectives, and an attack byabout 70 aircraft on the Swansea area on the night of the 19th/20th. On three nights light attacks were made on London. A total of 595 aircraft, includingminelayers, was plotted at night during the week.37. Minelaying, which was considerably increased, took place in LiverpoolBay, Bristol Channel, the Humber, the Wash and Thames Estuary.38. Fighter Command flew 549 patrols involving 1,595 sorties by day, and179 patrols involving 225 sorties by night.Coastal Reconnaissance, Patrols and Minelaying.39. The activities of Coastal Command were again curtailed by bad weather; 139 patrols involving 448 sorties were flown; these included 216 convoy escorts.40. Sea mines were laid in the Gironde Estuary, Terschelling Gat, and atHaugesund and numerous photographic reconnaissances were carried out betweenKiel and Bordeaux. Four attacks were made on enemy shipping with direct hitson a tanker off Bergen and a 3,000-ton merchant vessel near den Helder. Duringroutine reconnaissances between Stavanger and Borkum our aircraft reported thesighting of merchant ships in conroy and two formations of E-boats.41. Enemy long-range reconnaissance units were active off the West coast of Spain and the Western Approaches where shipping was attacked. 220 aircraft were identified as laying mines, compared with 115 during last week.Greece and Albania,42. Buildings were set alight at Durazzo and four enemy aircraft wereburnt out at Tirana during an attack by Wellingtons when 4 tons of bombs were dropped. Blenheims, sometimes with an escort of Gladiators, have providedcontinuous support to the Greek land forces in the Tepelene area where camps,stores, supply depots, gun positions, transport and attacking troops were bombed.In these operations two Blenheims were lost; four enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat.43. No reports of major air operations by the enemy have been received during the week.There have, however, recently been signs that German influence may have resulted in the adoption of a more vigorous and aggressive bombing policy againstthe Greeks. Instead of irregular sorties by small numbers of aircraft againstscattered objectives, raids by strong formations are now followed up by further attacks on the same target; consequently, the Italian air effort in Albania and greece is becoming more concentrated and effective than before.
Malta.44. Our aircraft patrolled the Western Ionian Sea and made reconnaissancesover Southern Sicily.45. The enemy repeated his attacks on the Island. Strong forces of. hisfighters appeared on four occasions with reconnaissance aircraft, and were drivenoff by our fighters. An enemy bomber was damaged by A.A. fire and one Hurricanewas shot down, the pilot being safe. Following a short raid on the night of the13th when the Pimearfa Hospital was damaged, a series of raids were made onthe night of the 14th over Valetta when land mines and bombs were dropped in the Grand Harbour, dockyard and town area. Casualties were not numerousalthough 55 houses were destroyed or partially demolished.Italy.46. On the night of the 15th/16th the Sicilian aerodromes at Catania,Comiso and Gela were attacked by Wellingtons. They also machine-gunned thebeacon station at Cape Passero. Buildings and hangars were hit at Cataniaand aircraft on the ground were left burning. On the following night Wellingtonsraided Brindisi aerodrome and hangars, and a seaplane were set alight. OneWellington is missing.Egypt and Libya.47. Since the capture of Cyrenaica no offensive operations by our aircraft have been reported.48. Benghazi was bombed by enemy aircraft on five occasions. On the 15th,93 civilians were killed and many houses destroyed. On the two following nightsefforts were made to drop mines in the harbour. Two daylight attempts weremade on the 18th and Hurricanes of the R.A.F. shot down three enemy aircraft,and damaged a further four. Anti-aircraft defences also destroyed one Ju 87.On the 19th five German bombers, escorted by seven German fighters, were intercepted by six Hurricanes over Benghazi and one enemy bomber was damaged.Later in the day Benghazi was again attacked by two enemy bombers, one ofwhich was destroyed by A.A. fire. On the same day three Hurricanes engagedseven German fighters near Agheila and two of our aircraft were shot down, onepilot being safe. Bombs were also dropped at Maraua (50 miles South-West ofApollonia) and at Soluch, Jedabya, and Agheila. Our fighters shot down three enemy aircraft.Dodecanese. . . -.49. Midi Bay aerodrome on Scarpanto Island (60 miles North-East of Crete)was attacked by Wellingtons on two nights and on the night of the 13th/14th3^ tons of bombs were dropped on Kattavia and Caleto aerodromes (Rhodes)where buildings and aircraft on the ground were damaged. Lindos Harbour(Rhodes) and Rhodes Harbour were bombed on the two following nights and fires were started among the dockside buildings. Two Wellingtons.were lost in these operations.Italian East Africa.50. Many operations were carried out in the Keren district in support ofour land forces. The railway station at Keren and the tracks leading from it,with the bridge at habitations Plantel (8 miles to the S.E.) were repeatedly bombedwith good effect. Our fighters attacked enemy troops and transport on theKeren-Asmara road, as well as at many other points. On the night of14th/.15th Wellesleys released 3^ tons of bombs on the buildings of the Caproniworks at Mai Adaga, and repeated the attack on the following day with 6^ tons.All the hangars were hit and the adjacent buildings demolished by fires and.explosions. In the above operations one enemy fighter was destroyed and fourdamaged without loss to ourselves.
51. In Abyssinia numerous attacks were made by Blenheims from Aden.Bombs were dropped at Assab, Dessie, Macalle, Hargueisa, and on theAddis-Jibouti railway at Diredawa and the bridge at Awash. In italian somaliland aircraft of the South African Air Force were active in support ofthe land forces along the line of the Juba River from Kisimayo to Bardera. bombs were dropped at Jelib and on the pontoon bridge at Gobwen (subsequentlyoccupied). Our aircraft also bombed enemy positions in the Omo River Delta(North of Lake Rudolph).Air Intelligence.Mediterranean.52. Up to 40 Me. 109 fighters are now probably operating in the central mediterranean.  They have still not been in action.Greece.53. The aircraft which have recently been reported as flying over Thraceand Eastern Macedonia have now been identified as wearing Bulgarian markings.Italy.54. A German air mission, consisting of Air Ministry engineers, and repre-sentatives of the leading aircraft firms, arrived at Turin on the 11th February.It is reported that Me. 109s are to be produced in Italy. Signor Oaproni isreported to have been invited to Berlin to discuss the future policy of the aircraftfirms under his control.   His anti-German views are well known.French North and West A frica.55. Withdrawal of aircraft from West Africa to North Africa now appearsto be in progress and the total of modern aircraft in West Africa has probably been reduced from 125 bombers and 110 fighters to 80-100 bombers and 50 fighters.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.56. Enemy activity has again been on a small scale this week. Somebombing has taken place in East Anglia and North-East Scotland. Reports of machine-gunning in both these areas have been received.By Night.57. Bombing by night has been widespread and on a somewhat larger scale,but it has been singularly ineffective in affecting our war effort. The london area and the Home Counties were chiefly a,ffected, but with the exception ofSwansea, which was raided on the night 19th/20th, no concentrated attack ona selected target was made.Damage.London.58. Eighteen key points were hit in London during raids on the nights of the17th/18th and 19th/20th, each lasting for some four hours. Damage was slight,and no factory has reported a loss of production greater than four days. Thechief cause of such loss was the interruption of night work through damage toroofs and windows. The key points affected were three in the London docks,thirteen factories, a gas works and the Royal Arsenal. A large number ofincendiary bombs were dropped and many fires were started, all of which werequickly extinguished.
Swansea.59. Damage was largely confined to private property, the dock area beinglittle affected. Some temporary dislocation to communications was caused butcasualties appear to be relatively slight.Elsewhere.60. On the 13th direct hits were scored on the British Aluminium CompanyWorks at Foyers, Inverness-shire, reducing production to some 20 per cent, of normal for some weeks.On the same day at Hendon 366 houses were destroyed or rendereduninhabitable and a further 400 suffered damage by a single large-calibre bomb.Seventy-five people were killed and 145 seriously injured.On the 17th/18th an archway shelter at London Bridge Station was hit.Rescue work is still in progress and final casualty figures may amount to some90 persons killed.Casualties.61. For the week ending 0600, 19th February, the estimated casualties are231 people killed and 495 injured.[22245]

The following further information has been received concerning theraids in the third week of December : (1) All the front windows in the Imperial Palace were broken and also manywindows in the Unter den Linden district.(2) The Woolworths Stores near the Alexanderplatz was burnt out.(3) An electrical lamp factory near the Schlesicher Station was hit.(4) 5-sfcorey houses in the Eisenacher Strasse and the Ronne Strasse were completely destroyed.Information has come to hand of the destruction of that part of Siemens andHalske Works which specialise in Gyro compasses and other instruments foraviation.   Some of these are now being manufactured at a factory outside Paris.Bremen. The damage has been described as enormous and is stated to be particularly noticeable around the Holzhafen.Straubing. A factory manufacturing light metals has been so seriously damaged that work cannot be continued.Krefeld. A firm manufacturing machinery has been severely damaged andis at present unable to fulfil orders.Hanover. Personal observation has disclosed that the oil refinery has been severely damaged.Dusseldorf and Rheydt. On the night of the 22nd/23rd January consider-able damage was caused in these towns. The main station at Dusseldorf was hit and was closed for a period owing to the reported existence of a delay actionbomb. 350,000 metres of artificial silk were destroyed in a fire caused, but it isnot known in which town this fire was started.General. The fires caused in Bremen were such that the fire services hadto be reinforced by a considerable part of tlhe fire-fighting personnel fromHamburg.
Mining.On the 9th January a German cargo ship of 2,000 tons en route from Stettinto a Danish port was sunk. On the 15th/16th January 2 German merchant ships were sunk off the Western entrance to the Fehmarn Channel. The channelwas closed for two days.The German steamer Euler, of 1,879 tons, which was for many months ina North Spanish port, recently escaped to Bordeaux. The ship did not succeed in reaching Germany for on its way it struck a mine off the French channel coast and sank.A report sent on the 6th February stated that the German Authorities inOslo announced that the Kiel Canal was only open to ships not exceeding 4,000tons. It is understood that ice has hindered the clearing of the obstruction causedby the sinking of a ship in the canal as a result of a mine in December.
