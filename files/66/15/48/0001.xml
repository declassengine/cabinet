THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1941.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (41) 75.April 2, 1941.&apos;TO BE KEPT - UNDER LOCK AND KEY,It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PRINCE FRIEDRICH OF PRUSSIA.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.AMONGST the German nationals interned in this country is PrinceFriedrich of Prussia, the son of the Crown Prince and grandson of the Kaiser.His case raises certain issues of policy, and I think the facts ought to be knownto the Cabinet.Before the outbreak of war Prince Friedrich, who was a frequent visitor tothis country, had spent some time here, and on the outbreak of war he wasstaying with Lord Glasgow at Kelburn Castle, near Fairlie.At the end of 1939, when the Germans in this country were examined bylocal tribunals, Prince Friedrich came before the local tribunal for the West ofScotland and was placed in Category C, that is to say, he was exempted from internment and from the special restrictions on movement applicable to enemy aliens.At Easter 1940 he went to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where, underthe name of Count von Lingen, he started to read history and modern languages.In May 1940, when it was thought necessary on military grounds to intern allmale Germans and Austrians living near the South and East coast, the Princewas interned together with the other Germans in Cambridge.In July 1940, when it was decided to send overseas a number of internedpersons of enemy nationality, the Prince was included in the party sent on theEttrick to Canada.In December 1940 when Mr. Alexander Paterson was sent out by the HomeOffice to Canada to select those internees who could properly be sent back to thiscountry with a view to their release being considered, he included in the firstparty sent back Prince Friedrich of Prussia. Mr. Paterson said: &quot;When Ivisited the camp where the Prince is confined I found that he was the campleader and was of the greatest service to the camp authorities. From the moment that the Ettrick left England he became in a very modest but competent mannerthe acknowledged leader of the internees. Most of the Cambridge men regardhim seriously as one of the men who, after the war, will take the lead inGermany, and help to re-establish some form of Government. I saw a good dealof him at the camp, and formed the highest impression of his ideals and hispersonality. He may not have an absolutely first-class brain, and he has not readvery widely, but he is sound to the core, and there is no doubt that he hascharacter and leadership which would give him the command with all ranks ofmen. A good deal therefore depends on the way in which he will prepare himselffor a position of very great responsibility in the future.&quot;Prince Friedrich was unwilling to return to England because he thoughtthat he could do useful work in  the camp and remain in obscurity, but[22375]
Mr. Paterson persuaded him that it was his duty to return in order to pursuehis studies and enlarge his mind. Mr. Paterson felt that &quot; he is bound inevitably,if he remains much longer in a camp, to acquire the very limited perspective ofan internee, to magnify molehills and to regard too seriously the petty injusticesof a small community. If he is to play his part on the big stage, he must getoutside the wire as soon as possible.&quot;When Prince Friedrich returned to England, the Home Office asked sir Will Spens (the Master of Corpus) whether he could arrange for the Prince,if released, to continue his studies at Corpus. Sir Will Spens said that althoughthe Prince had only been at Corpus for two or three weeks he had been veryfavourably impressed by him and he would be willing to have him back, but he felt some doubt whether the Prince would not get more advantages out of an american University than out of Cambridge, seeing that the normal under-graduate life had been greatly disturbed by war conditions.Under the White Paper regulating the policy for the release of Germans and austrians there is a provision that students can be released &quot; who, at the timeof their internment, were pursuing a course of study at a university . . . .provided that the Vice-Chancellor .... certifies that it is desirable that thestudent should continue his studies .... and that the circumstances are such that a British student would, in similar circumstances, be allowed to continue his studies.&quot; As Prince Friedrich. who is about 29 years of age and is a graduateof Berlin, was not reading for a degree at Cambridge or engaged on a specific lineof research, it was impossible for the Cambridge authorities to give him acertificate under this category.The Prince has been asked whether he would be willing, if released, toemigrate to the United States, but the Prince said quite definitely that he would prefer to remain in this country. One of his reasons was that it would be difficult for him. to escape public notice in the United States, and he was anxious to avoid&quot; publicising &quot; either himself or his friends.The Prince said that, if it were not possible to allow him to go backto Canada, he would like to work on the land. In 1939-40 he had been working on a farm belonging to Mr. Channon, M.P., Parliamentary Private Secretary toMr. H. A. Butler. One of the categories of persons eligible for release is acategory relating to skilled workers in agriculture, but it was felt in the HomeOffice impracticable to treat the Prince as falling under this category.There seems to be no doubt that the Prince&apos;s sympathies are anti-Nazi andthat there would probably be no danger in releasing him from internment. This,however, can be said of some other German internees who, so far as can be ascertained, are not anxious to help their country of origin. As was pointed outby the Asquith Committee, it would be impracticable to base the policy of releaseon an examination of each individual case (apart from the time required, it wouldin many cases be impossible to ascertain the individual&apos;s attitude with certainty),and the policy approved by the Cabinet has been (a) to release those who are willing to join the Pioneer Corps or come within one of the other specialcategories in the White Paper, and (b) to examine individually by means of a tribunal those only who are over military age or are rejected for the pioneer corps.To apply for permission to join the Pioneer Corps would not be a suitablemethod for the Prince, and it seems clear that, if he is to be released, he mustbe released by a special decision and not because he complies with some generalcondition which would cover the case of any German however humble.If it were possible to say that in releasing the Prince the same treatmenthad been meted out to him as would be meted out to any other German whateverhis rank or condition, there would be no difficulty in authorising the Prince&apos;srelease : but it is not easy to justify his release on special grounds peculiar to himself. His release is almost certain to attract some publicity, and it will nodoubt be suggested that special favours have been shown to him because of hisrank.On the other hand, there are substantial reasons for releasing the Princesubject to supervision, although those reasons would be difficult to advance in public.H. M.Home Office, April 2, 1941
