(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&quot; &quot; secret,,, \ Iw:vr[ra) 67. \      copy no.26ttt March, 3.9U1 * IWAR CABINET.The Blockade of Unoccupied France andFrench North A&quot;frica.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of economic warfare.1.       The Cahinet decided on June 25th last to &quot;blockadeunoccupied Prance and on July 13th to &quot;blockade French north africa,     These decisions were announced and have never beenrescinded.     But it has never been possible to make them whollyeffective and,  in recent months, they have rapidly become lass and less effective.2.       From October 1st, 1940,  to March 1st, 1941, ships with a gross registered tonnage of 2,650,000 tons, carryingan estimated cargo of 1,750,000 tons, were unloaded at Marseilles.Most of this came direct from North African ports, but 700,000gross tons, with an estimated cargo capacity of 750,000 tons,passed through the Straits of Gibraltar,      Over &amp;5% of this last total came from French West Africa,     The rest came from french Colonies east of the Cape or across the Atlantic from theFrench West Indies,      Some of the less bulky cargoes from outside the Mediterranean are unloaded at Casablanca, railedto Oran and thence shipped to Marseilles.Much the most important part of the traffic through theStraits consists of ground nuts from French West Africa.These yield vegetable oil, most valuable to the enemy in viewof his severe shortage of fats, of which there is clear proof.The traffic from French North Africa includes grain, fruit,  earlyvegetables, fish, eggs, phosphates and lead.3.       Since France fell, we have never been able to stoptraffic east of the Straits across the Western basin.     We havemade occasional interceptions of French ships entering the Medi-terranean.      Out of 108 French ships on their way to Francethrough the Straits since the beginning of the year we haveintercepted 8.      I fear that these interceptions have had nomarked deterrent effect upon the traffic from Dakar up the west african coast.     Elsewhere, off South America and near Madagascar,our interceptions of French ships have been much more deterrentand, for the time being, even decisive.Broadly, therefore, Unoccupied-France is receiving,almost unchecked, from French North and West Africa, suppliesof the produce of these areas, but no significant supplies, so far,from other sources.     There is abundant and continuing evidencethat a substantial part of all imports into Unoccupied France is removed to Germany.4.       Lack of warships and fear of trouble with the French Fleethave caused us to permit this wide and dangerous breach in theblockade.     We are also under pressure from the U.S. Administration.At the President&apos;s request, we agreed to let through, a ship ata time, cargoes of preserved milk, vitamins and baby clothes (inaddition to strict medical supplies) for children in unoccupied france/
France,  to be distributed by the American Red Cross.     We havenow agreed, again at the insistence of the State Department, tonavicert two shiploads of flour for Unoccupied France.     Theseshipments are trifling in themselves.     But they give away a principle.     They will be followed, I feel sure, by further demands from many quarters for passage through our blockade of increasingquantities of an ever widening range of goods to an ever growing number of countries, including all those now in German occupation,5.       Recently, in the hope of checking German infiltrationinto North Africa, we proposed to Washington that they shou3.U makea &quot;dramatic offer&quot; to Vichy, that we should navicert 5 to 8 million bushels of wheat for Unoccupied France and a reasonable ration ofthe principal commodities for French North Africa.     This was on condition that Vichy should stop this infiltration, and accei^tcontrol by U.S. observers of the distribution of these imports;and that some British observers also should enter French north africa, either as Consular Officers or otherwise.6.       The U.S. Government have not made this offer, but arediscussing with the French both infiltration and supplies.     they wish to separate the question of supplies to Unoccupied France fromthat of supplies to French North Africa, and to take the latter question first.     There are advantages in this procedure,  so longas we insist on the entry, as soon as possible, of the american and British observers.     Otherwise we may soon wake up to find thatall French North Africa has gone German and,  in consequence, thatSpain has gone as well.      If our proposed conditions were accepted,here, at least, would be some solid quid pro quo for a comparativelyinnocuous relaxation of the blockade.Meanwhile, pending the outcome of discussions betweenWashington and Vichy, I strongly urge that we should maintain our economic pressure and intercept and seize as many French blockadrunners as possible.     No unnavicerted ships, or cargoes should hereleased.    I suggest that the less we interfere with French ships,the less will Vichy be inclined to come to any agreement,8.       We should not go beyond our conditional offer of a large quantity of wheat for Unoccupied France.     There are very grave objections to any general rationing agreement with the vichy government.     They are not a free agent nor genuinely neutral.They are hanging on to our ships.     Their factories are working for the Germans and not for us.     They are blackmailed by their twomillion prisoners.     It is practically impossible, even for a large army of American observers, to prevent re-export from the UnoccupiedZone.     Our experience with Spain and Portugal shows that rationingagreements do not eliminate friction or controversy.      So long asthe French Fleet is controlled by Admiral Darlan, no rationingagreement with Vichy will remove the risk of a naval collision.9.       The House of Commons made it clear yesterday, as on previous occasions, that it is strongly opposed to any weakening of our blockade.     I believe that this is also the attitude of thevast majority of the British people.     In eighteen months our economic pressure has imposed grave shortage on the enemy.     Therecan be no doubt that the campaign to force us to raise the blockade of France is planned and directed from Germany.I, therefore, ask my colleagues to agree:(a)    that we should accept the American proposal to try first to get agreement on supplies to North Africa;
H. D.(b) that we should do our utmost to impress the Americanswith the great and imminent danger of Gorman infiltration and withthe urgent need that many American and. some British observersshould go to North Africa at once;(c) that, pending the outcome of discussions betweenWashington and Vichy, we should intercept as many French ships-as possible and not release nnnavicerted ships or cargoes;(d) that we should not consider any general rationingagreement with Vichy, nor go beyond our offer of wheat;(e) that we should, reason earnestly with Washington against all further blockade concessions, unless accorrrpanied by somesolid quid pro cmo of real advantage to our war effort.
