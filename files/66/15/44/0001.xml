Royal Arthur at Skegness on the lines of the courses which have been so beneficial to the Norwegian and Belgian ratings. The Frenchparty numbers 28, with one officer. The first reports which have been receivedare favourable.The discipline in minor respects of Free French vessels based on the Clydehaving been criticized by local British Naval Officers, the matter was franklydiscussed with Admiral Muselier previous to his visit to that base.[22313] b
The Liaison Officer at Portsmouth has reported that the attitude of some british Officers in their dealings with the French is unfriendly and tactless.The Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, is, however, confident that the steps takenin accordance with the instructions contained in CAT.0.314 will remedy thismatter. The same order will no doubt have effect on the Clyde, where the french have been heard to say that the British do not take the F.N.F.L. seriously.A complaint is reported from the Clyde about the non-payment of marriageallowances for wives in occupied territory. This matter has been underconsideration, and a decision, to be promulgated shortly in an A.F.O., has been arrived at to pay allowances into a blocked account for distribution after the war.Two more Chasseurs, previously manned by the Poles at Dartmouth, havenow been taken over by the French.The French Submarine Minerve has carried out her first war patrol.Frenchman in the Royal Navy.2.

We are crusaders, as it is actually a Crusade ofChristianity against barbarity. It is the fight of the Powers of Goodagainst the Powers of Evil.&quot;From Francis Herry (Belgian), *Wi Officer, S/S Thysville, to a friend inCanada.&quot; The friendliness of the English towards the sailors is wonderful -weare received everywhere as friends, and they look after us as well as they do their own men, if not better.&quot;A few letters from relatives of Free Frenchmen are extremely heated- indenouncing those who have joined General de Gaulle as traitors. There are alsocases of the information gained from men who have been repatriated being usedto induce Free French personnel to return to France and to lower their morale.Letters from Free French personnel continue to show great enthusiasmand hope.
F. 160.   Chasseur Group,   12.2.41.&quot;It is possible for me, in each of my letters, to write to you of newAnglo-French successes, for, although small in number, French Forces are co-operating in Africa with the English. Therefore, I can write of &apos; our &apos;successes. Behold the Macaronis being chased out of Libya, and, soon, fromeverywhere in Africa. ... It is always cowardly to give in still more soto &apos; collaborate&apos; when one has colonies full of men and material, anundamaged and powerful fleet, and a nation whose morale is not crushed with which to continue the fight.&quot;Douala, 27.12.40. From a Belgian sailor serving with the Free French Navy,,writing to Brazil.&apos;&apos; In London nobody has abandoned his post and the certainty of victory-reigns supreme. Here and elsewhere the contempt for the Vichy Governmentis enormous. At Freetown I was presented to General de Gaulle when hepassed through there. He looks a very intelligent and energetic man. let us hope that the rest of French Africa will rally round him to work for thedownfall of Vichy and its ignoble politics (? policy).&quot;A French Merchant seaman writing to Algiers says : -&quot; I am Chief Engineer on board a Free French ship. The morale herein Great Britain is excellent and life pursues its normal course in spite ofthe air attacks. The British calm is a really wonderful thing. As for ussailors, our existence is much more settled these days and the future is not so black.  We look forward to freedom with honour.&quot;One letter from M/S Victor Guilloux at Belfast gave some particularsregarding French sailors who at one time wished to be repatriated : &quot; I should like to reiterate that I have decided to remain with theAllied Services and should be obliged if you would cancel my former requests for repatriation.  I can also tell you that my colleagues wish to do the same.&quot;
