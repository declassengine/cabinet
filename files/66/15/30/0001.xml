(41) 155.) ,,WE have examined the revised draft agreement referred to us on the11th March, 1941. We consider that on military grounds articles I and II areobjectionable because of the wide range of power accorded to the United states in peace, in emergency, and in war, without recognition of British authority or interest in the defence of the territories. As these articles now stand we wishto emphasise that, whether the United States is at war or not, the Americaninterpretation of &apos;&apos; military necessity &apos;&apos; may obstruct the operation of our forces and fixed defences.2. We accordingly strongly urge that Article II of the agreement should be amended to read as follows : &apos;&apos; When either the United States of America or the United kingdom is engaged in war or in time of other emergency, it shall have all such rights,power and authority in the Territories and surrounding waters or air spacesas may be necessary for conducting any military operations deemed by itdesirable; but these rights will be exercised with all possible regard to thespirit of the fourth Clause of the Preamble.&quot;3. If, however, it is considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government that insistence on the above amendment would prevent agreement being reached and therebysubstantially reduce or delay material assistance from the United States uponwhich the successful issue of the war almost certainly depends, we have no hesitation in expressing the view that, on military grounds, the agreement shouldbe accepted as now drafted.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.C.
