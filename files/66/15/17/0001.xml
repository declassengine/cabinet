February 1941.Copy No.TO BE KEPT UNDER-LOOK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.PUBLICITY FOR ANTI-GAS MEASURES.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.AT their meeting on the 6th February (W.M. (41) 14) the War cabinet approved a recommendation that there should be a carefully devised campaign of increasing publicity designed to familiarise the public with anti-gas precau-tions without raising alarm. In accordance with that decison, measures recently taken to remind the public of the possibility of gas attack and to instruct themin methods of self-protection have been kept within fairly narrow limits, so as toavoid any appearance of a marked development in Government policy which might give the Germans a reason or a pretext for using gas against us. No officialmaterial has been issued, and no publicity sought for any official administrative measures. The Press has been encouraged to print a good deal of instructionand exhortation on agreed lines, and has co-operated very usefully. In one ortwo respects there has been more emphasis than might have been desired, but thisis inevitable and would be likely to grow worse for a time if the present policycontinued.2. The practical effect on the public mind, however, as reflected in thenumber who have been sufficiently influenced to carry gas masks, has not beengreat. It is doubtful whether at present as many as 20 per cent, of the people in London streets are carrying their masks. Probably a continuation and develop-ment of publicity within the limits at present agreed could be made to do a gooddeal more, but of itself it is unlikely to do anything like enough.Moreover, the present method has handicapped administrative measures andinstructional work.3. The position, therefore, is that the risk of heavy casualties from initiallarge-scale gas attacks must be reckoned to be great much greater than it wouldbe if the public were in a state of real preparedness. The extensive use in ourcities, in favourable conditions, of large phosgene bombs would cause greatnumbers of painful deaths among people who were either without their masksor were not well practised in putting them on quickly and wearing them.I am bound to draw attention to the risks which may attend any continuedrestriction on public instructional measures and publicity.4. Nor does the policy of restriction appear to have served its purpose.German spokesmen and broadcasters are now reported to have commented on theevident preoccupation of Britain with the gas question, noting the tendency ofour Press to ascribe to Germany the intention to attack, but remarking that all of the activity seems to be on our side.5, In my judgment the appropriate course is to make an explicit statementof policy on behalf of the Government. The points it should make are/^i) tfeatl-we regard the gas weapon with, abhorrence and will in no circumstances be the first to make use of it; (ii) thatVwe cannot rely upon our enemy&apos;s undertakings not touse it as proof that he will not in fact do so; (lii) kh.at)ff he does, he may count[22260]SECRET.W.P. (41) 44.February 27, 1941.
upon powerful and immediate retaliation; but (iv) tbeptm behoves us to take fulldefensive measures for the safety of the civilian population, which must itselfco-operate by carrying and practising with its gas masks and obeying otherinstructions given to it. \6. Such a statement would have a far more marked effect on the public than any amount of unofficial or semi-official and indirect advice. Of itself it would go a long way to achieve the necessary state of preparedness. But in addition would open the way to further direct and effective measures which,, betweenthem could be relied upon to do all that was necessary.Among the possible measures that have been considered is the making of anOrder compelling the public to carry gas masks or at least to have them readily available. This, however, is attended with very considerable difficulties of enforcement, and on practical grounds I do not recommend it. I propose to rely on direct advice to the public as indicated in paragraph 5 above.The measures that I have in mind are an intensification of instruction tothe public by various means now treated as outside the permitted limits, among them (i) broadcast talks and a regular broadcast &quot; gas mask drill,&quot; both of whichhave been avoided hitherto because anything the B.B.C. does is regarded here and abroad as &quot; official &quot; ; (ii) statements to the Press which, because they couldbe given officially, would be more authoritative and accurate than the unofficialinstruction recently appearing; (iii) practical exercises on a scale much more extensive than I have hitherto felt prepared to authorise because of the difficultyof controlling the attendant publicity; and (iv) official leaflets of instructionwhich can be made of great value, but have up to now not been regarded as falling within the agreed limits.In short, I propose the issue of a statement reiterating our intentions withregard to the use of gas. and emphasising the importance of measures for thedefence ,of the civil population; and if this is agreed I ask approval for theprogramme of subsequent instructional publicity and training which I have indicated.H. M.February 27/1941.
