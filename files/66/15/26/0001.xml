THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1941.SECRET. Copy No.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.MIDDLE EAST.Copy of a telegram, No. 0/45279, dated March 2, 1941, from Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to the War Office, in reply to telegram No. 53929(M.O. 5) dated February 27, 1941.1. Latest information indicates recent reinforcements to Tripolitaniacomprise two Italian Infantry Divisions, two Italian Motorized Arty. Regts.,and German Armd. Troops estimated at maximum of one Armd. Bde. Gp. no evidence of additional M.T. landed, and enemy must still be short of transport.Latest air reconnaissance, however, shows considerable increase in M.T. onTripoli-Sirte road.2. Tripoli to Agheiia is 471 miles and to Benghazi 646 miles. There is onlyone road and water is inadequate over 410 miles of the distance; these factors,together with lack of transport, limit the present enemy threat. He can probablymaintain up to one Inf. Div. and Armd. Bde. along the coast road in about threeweeks, and possibly at the same time employ a second Armd. Bde., if he has oneavailable, across the desert via Hon and Marada against our flank.3. He may test us at Agheiia by offensive patrolling and if he finds us weakpush on to Jadabya in order to move up his advanced landing grounds. I donot think that with this force he will attempt to recover Benghazi.4. Eventually two German Divisions might be employed in a large-scale,attack. This with one or two Inf. Divs. would be the maximum maintainablevia Tripoli. Shipping risks, difficulty of communications and the approach ofhot weather make it unlikely that such an attack could develop before the endof the summer. Effective interference by sea with convoys and by air withTripoli might extend this period.5. Cyrenaica Garrison will shortly consist of 3 Armd. Bde., 9 Aus. Div.,3 Indian Motor Bde. Latter two incompletely trained and equipped. AdditionalA/Tk. units are urgent requirement because one Inf. Bde. Coy. only at present available.   Am withdrawing some from Sudan.6. The Italian air threat to Cyrenaica is at present almost negligible. on other hand Germans already well established in Central Mediterranean and havenow available for operations against Malta, sea communications, Cyrenaica andfor defence of their convoys and Tripolitania approximately, bombers 170, dive-bombers 90, fighters 60, reconnaissance 18, transport aircraft 180. These strengthscan and are likely to be increased. From bases in both Tripolitania and Sicilyheavy scale air attacks are being carried out on our forward troops, bases andline of communication in Cyrenaica. Aerial mine laying ports, especially Tobruk,particular menace.  In view of other commitments our own air forces permanently[22278-1]
available to counter German land and air activities against Cyrenaica and toprovide support for our land forces are not likely to exceed 1 fighter squadron,1 medium bomber squadron, 1 army co-operation squadron, though bombing effort will be augmented periodically by heavy bombers working from Malta andCyrenaica. For time being, however, second fighter squadron destined forGreece has been retained Cyrenaica. Also, with other commitments A.A. defence is inadequate.7. As regards Egypt, air attacks from west now unlikely in immediatefuture, but German and Italian aircraft, especially former, operating fromMandible, are becoming increasingly active in Eastern Mediterranean and aresucceeding, for present at any rate, in virtually closing canal by aerial mines.Alexandria and Delta area also within easy reconnaissance and bombing rangefrom Mandible. Therefore, until Mandible liquidated, must maintain strong air defences in Egypt. One fighter squadron only available whole area. special measures, including fighters and balloons, having to be taken in canal zone.Necessary also divert portion heavy bomber effort from other most important tasksfor reduction air threat Egypt by bombing air bases Mandible.8. German parachute troops might be landed on our L.S. of C. in combina-tion with Armd. forces. I do not anticipate that parachutists will be used withthe scale of attack likely to be developed in near future, but they are a possibleaccompaniment of a large-scale attack at later date.9.   Paragraphs 6 and 7 above were drawn up by A.O.C.-in-C.
