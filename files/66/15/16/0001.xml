SECRET,egypt (a$)26 Feb.TO BE KEPT UNbEfi LOCK AND KEY(this document is the ^5^^$!^^^iniD i* y ensure the S3sr*sc$ cf this document.(WP (Mf) j-3 V;aR CABINET Copy No.     28.EVACUATION OF COASTAL areasMemorandum &quot;by the Minister of InformationThis paper is written without any knowledge of the military plansthat have teen made against invasion,,   A demand has recently &quot;been put forward&quot;by the War Office that greater efforts should be made to secure the evacuation of certain towns on the East and South East coast and that these efforts shouldbe e:ctended to four towns in Sussex that have hitherto been unaffected.From the point of view of civilian efficiency and morale there aregrave objections to evacuation.    It means in the first place complete temporaryruin for large numbers of peoplen    In the second place it means dumping uponalready overcrowded district,&apos;? additional numbers of idle and disgruntledstrangers,    Reluctant hosts are condemned to entertain unwilling guests for ahindefinite periods   A &quot;better seed ground for the growth of rumour, war-weariness and defeatism could hardly be imagined.In the third place the reception areas are just as likely to be theobject of air attack as the evacuated areas.    The more crowded they are thegreater the casualties will &quot;be, the greater the detriment to the policy ofdispersal and the greater tie resentment of those who suffer and who feel thatthey would have been safer at home.These objection&apos;:., rood they are not the only ones, to the -policy of increased evacuation- muse all give way to military requirements;    howeverdisastrous such steps may be to too civilian population, they must be taken ifthey are essential to national defence.It would &quot;jo useful to see the case stated from the military stand-point 0   Pending such a statement it may be permitted to raise a few questions.First., have we nor- already based our plans sufficiently upon theassumption that the enemy will attack at some point within the limited frontwhere he knows that we are expecting him to attack, and where he knows that wehave made all possible preparations to receive him?   The South East coast hasalways been the obvious place for an. invading force to land, and for this very-reason Intelligent invaders have always avoided it.   William of Orange landed atTorbay, Henry Tudor landed at Milford Haven, Edward IT landed at Ravenspur in yorkshire.   To each one of these astute and successful invaders London was of almost as great importance as it is to-day and. the distances that divided their various ports of disembarkation from London were greater than they are to-daybecause their armies moved more slowly,.   But relying upon the enormous military value of surprise, they rightly struck where they were least expected.    Is itimpossible that; the Ge :mans will do likewise?   And granting the possibility;, isit wise to inflict unnecessary suffering on the civilian population on theassumption that the blow is almost bound to fall within a limited area?   Surelywhat matters most to Germany is to get a large army established on the soil of britain.    The number of miles that divides that army from the capital is a secondary consideration.Secondly, could not what is desired be obtained by different methods?Voluntary evacuation encouraged by propaganda is never likely to secure the-withdrawal of more than GCfb of the population and such withdrawal will always be followed,, as soon as pressure is removed, by a steady dribble baclc ofthe population of the larger towns is quite sufficient to present the militarywith the problem they most dread. - congestion of refugees on the roads.   would it not be possible to have in readiness a scheme for the complete evacuation of coastal towns - not only those within the area where the enemy knows he isexpected - but of all coastal towns throughout the kingdom, so that he would find us equally ready wherever he struck?   Large scale invasion as apart from a/raid

-i 2raid cannot take place without the military authorities receiving some warning, -probably of several days.    Forty-eight hours should be sufficient to emptyalmost any coastal town of its inhabitants if the movement has been plannedbeforehand, the inhabitants warned, the transport made available and ther    reception billets prepared,,One of the main objects of such evacuation must be not only to preventcongestion on the roads but also to give the defenders a free hand in shellingthe evacuated   town, assuming that the enemy scores an initial success and takespossession of it.   There would be some hesitation in shelling a town where l+Ofoof the boldest native inhabitants were still in residence, but if it were com-pletely evacuated and completely occupied by the enemy there would be noobjection to reducing it to a heap of rubble.There is likelihood that the enemy will attack in more than one placebut he cannot attack simultaneously in all.   The readier we are to receive him in&apos;one locality, the less likely he is to come there.   Large scale evacuation of civilians is the kind of movement which it is almost impossible to concealindefinitely.I understand that where there is a large front to defend it isgenerally considered sound military policy to hold it lightly and to have in reserve a central force that can be moved rapidly up to the threatened section.Is not the converse of this policy as applied to the civilian population toleave them where they are rather than take up dispositions before the battle,but to be prepared to withdraw them rapidly and completely as soon as it is knownwhere the attack will fall?   Instead of fiddling with the problem in anticipation,ought we not to make complete preparation to deal drastically with it when the .moment arrives?Nothing in the above need interfere with the policy of encouragingpeople to move from the more menaced districts if they can conveniently do sosD.
