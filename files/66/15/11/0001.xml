Sir Mo Lampson (Cairo).21st February, 1941.Do      Go 58 porno        21st February, 1941.Re      2.20 a mu        22nd February, 19410Noo  355o3533IMMEDIATE.Following for Prome Minister from Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs-2o      CIoG.Sc  and I have to-day had full discussions with three Commanders-An-Ghiefo30     Following conclusions emerged,4,     We are agreed we should do everything in our power to bring the fullest measure of help to Greeks atearliest possible memento      If the help we can offer is accepted by the Greeks we believe that there is a fairchance of halting a German, advance and preventing Greecefrom being overrun..      Limitation of our resources howeverespecially in the air will not allow of help being given to turkey at the same time if Greece is to be supported on an effective scale,&apos;5o     Longmore has kept the Chief of Air Staff informed of dispositions of his forces (see particularly Q67 ofFebruary 17th to the Air Ministry).      Attacks by german aircraft on Benghazi and his other (?gpo  omitted) inEasx Africa even when reduced to the lowest possible figureleave him -ith much smaller margin of modern aircraftsuitable to meet Germans than we had estimated,,      Rate of wastage in recent fighting against Germans has risen.This process is inevitable and will continue as Royal AirForce meets Germans instead of Italians.      Squadrons nowsuporting Greeks have been increased to seven.      In additionone bomber squadron this month to be fallowed by two bomber squadrons and one army co-operation squadron (Hurricane andLysanders) which will be made available by the end of MarciuHe also hopes to form two fighter squadrons during Marchbut this must depend on supply of equipment and ammunition for Tomahawks of which date of arrival hei*e is unknown,,Moreover Tomahawks as yet untried in warfare.      ThreeWellington squadrons would also be available for long distance night bombing as required from aerodromes suitablefor their occupation,,      These dispositions leave no marginwhatever for any air help to Turkey from resources at  ,present available or in sight in the Middle East.      Moreoverpresent limited air forces available make it doubtfulwhether we can hold a line   overing Salonica which general wavell is prepared to contemplate.      Commander-in-Chief ofMediterranean considers that he can supply the necessaryprotection at sea to enable Salonica to be used as base butemphasizes that to do this he will need air protection whichwe fear would prove an insuperable difficulty.,     Question of line to be held in Greece will be discussed with Greekswhom we hope to meet Saturday0

k qSc,     General Wavell proposes the following military dispositions,      Cyrenaica will &quot;be garrisoned by one of theless trained and equipped Australian divisions, Indianmotor brigade at present under training and one armoured brigade group which represents all remaining at present of the 7th armoured division,,     You will remember thatthis armoured division was never at full strength.Further complication reported by Commander-in^ChiefMediterranean is that troops at Benghazi cannot at present be maintained by sea owing to destruction of port.      Inaddition heavy ai r attack and mining have even reduced the usefulness of Benghazic.      Supply must therefore be by road from Tobruko      (gp. undec,) division is being formed andwill be used for Mandibles0      Forces committed to operations in Eritrea cannot be reduced until operations there havebeen successfully completed.     Keren is proving a tough nutto crack,,     On the other hand it is agreed that forces in kenya can be reduced and warning orders have been issued for withdraw/al of South African division with a view toits movement to Egypt when shipping can be made available.I hope to see Smuts on this and other matters before Ireturn home.;,7o     General Wavell has therefore the following forces available for Greece in immediate and the near future.Firstly one armoured brigade and a New Zealand division(now raised to three infantry brigades) ready to sail;to be   followed by Polish brigade, an Australian division,a second armoured brigade (if required) and a secondAu&amp;ralian division in that order.     Despatch of this force will inevitably strain administrative resources to theutmost and must involve much improvisation.80     Timings cannot yet be given as these depend ondiscussion with the Greeks and shipping.      It is estimatedthat to move the above forces at least 53 ships will berequiredo     These can of course only be obtained by holdingships of convoys arriving in the Middle East with all thatthat implies.     Additional to present anxiety is the menaceof mines to the Suez Canal.     Energetic measures are beingtaken to deal with this but until they are fully organised and material arrives from home there is always a risk thatthe canal may be closed from five to seven days.9.     My own conclusion which C.I.G.S. and Commanders-in-Chief share is that in the immediate future assistanceto the Greeks who are fighting and are threatened must havefirst call on resources.      Extent of help which we canlater give Turks must depend upon speculation and volume ofair reinforcements that can reach the Middle East and warwastage in African operations.10o     My present intention is to tell the Greeks of the help we are prepared to give them now and to urge them toaccept it as fast as it can be shipped to them.      If theywill accept this help and brave any risk it may entail ofinvolving them in early hostilities with Germany there is afair chance that we can hold a line in Greece.      If we nowsplit our small resources especially in the air we caneffectively help neither Greeceror Turkey.

Wave 11 is ready to&apos; make available three divisions, a (grp.-. uncleCKl provision) brigade and best part of an armoured divisiontogether with a number of specialised troops such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft units0      Though some of these(grpn  omtcL )s have yet to be concentrated.-, work is already in hand and they can reach Greece as rapidly as provision ofships will alloWo      This programme fulfils the hopesexpressed In Defence Committee that we could make available a force of three divisions and an armoured division.      In   &apos;order to do -his we shall have to place a severe strain on administrative services and have to improvise widely.     you can be sure that we are not being bound by establishmentslaid downc      In fact we could not possibly make availablesuch a force in so short a time if we were,2n      Gravest anxiety is not in respect of army but ofair0      There is no doubt that need to fight a German air forinstead of Italian is creating a new problem for Longmore0My own impression is that all his squadrons here are not quitup to standard of their counterpart at lioiae.     Having beenvery hardly worked in chasing Italians these last monthssome of them are tired and as will be seen from paragraph 5of Cairo telegram No,. 355, the supply of modern aircraftstill leaves much to be desiredo     Many good (troop)ersare still mounted on wretched pon:ies0     We should all haveliked to approach Greece to-morrow with a suggestion thatwe should join with them in holding a line to defend .Salonica but &quot;both Longmore and Cunningham are convinced thatour present air resources will not allow us to do this.Dill and I are not prepared to take a final decision until we have discussed the matter with the Greeks,,

3c      As regards general prospects of a Greekcampaign, it       of course a gamble to send forces to the mainland of Europe to fight Germans at this time,      No one can give a guarantee of successbut when we discussed thismatter in London we were prepared to run the risk of failure, thinking it better to suffer with the Greeks than to make no attempt to help them.      That is the convictionwe all hold here,..      Moreover,  though campaign is a daringventure, we are not without hope that it might succeed tothe extent of halting the Germans before they overrun allGreeceo4.      It has to be remembered that the stakes are big..If we fail to help the Greeks there is no hope of action byYugoslavia-,, and the future of Turkey may easily becompromised,,      Though, therefore, none of us can guarantee that we may not have to play trump cards of our (? bare)strong suit, we believe that this attempt to help Greeceshould be made0      It is of course quite possible that when we see the Greeks to-morrow they may not wish us to come.If so, a new   situation will have been created in respect ofwhich we will have to think afresh.     But all my efforts willbe concentrated on trying to induce   the Greeks to accept our help now.5.     We have discussed the question of command.      Dill,Wavell and I are all agreed that we must select a figure whowill command respect with the Greeks and exercise authority over the Greek officers with whom he will have to work.      Itis aliio necessary to choose a first class tactical soldier.We have therefore decided that the command should be given toWilson who will be replaced in the military governorship of cyrenaica by Neame, at present Commanding in Palestine.      We -have carefully considered the claims of 01Connor but although a dashing leader we do not think he is of the same stature asWilson.      Moreover, Wilson will have to command an Australiancorps and a New Zealand division, both of them led by strongpersonalities who are also senior soldiers.     Wilson has avery high reputation here among the general public, as wellas amongst the soldiers, and his appointment to lead theforces in Greece will be a guarantee to the Greeks that we are giving of our best.

/&quot;&quot;This telegram is of particular secrecy and shouldhe retained, &quot;by the authorised recipient and not passed on.JSPECIAL (EDEN - PRIME MINISTER)Dec-^r-hers    Sir Mo Palairet    (Athens).25rd February, 1941.Do      b340 army 23rd February, 1941.11,,    10.3 50 aofflo 23rd February, 1941.Noc  263 cz z zzzrrrrrvvwvMOSTJEI^DIATE,MOST SSC^ilT&apos;/&quot;&apos;Following from Secretary of State for Prime Minister.PERSONALoAgreement was reached today with the Greek Governmenton all pointSowhen at the end of discussions I asked whether theGreek Government would welcome the arrival in Greece ofBritish troops in numbers and on conditions we proposed,President, of Council stated formally that the GreekGovernment accepted our offer with gratitude and approvedall detailed arrangements reached between the two General Staffs,2*     On arrival here this afternoon we met with theKing of Greece, the President of Council and GeneralPapagoso      I gave an account of the international situation as we see it and dealt in detail with German designs uponthe BalkanSo      I then explained that the conclusion had beenreached by Ministers and Chief of Staffs in London, withwhich Commander s-i;a-Chief here are in full agreement thatwe should give maximum help to Greece at the earliestpossible moment,     We then gave details of the forces whichwe should be able to make available for Greece, explaining that this was all we could do at the moment.      What weshould be able to do in future depended on the developmentof the general war situation and the state of our resources.All I could say was that the troops we offered were wellequipped and well trained and we were confident that theywould acquit themselves well.50      The President of Council, after reaffirming the determination of Greece to defend herself against Germany,reiterated the misgivings of the Greek Government lestinsufficient British help should merely precipitate german attack, and stated that it was essential to determine whetheravailable Greek forces and forces which we could providewoulA suffice to constitute efficacious resistance to theGermans, taking into account the doubtful attitude of Turie yand Yugoslavia.     Before the Greek Government committed themselves, the ^re^ident of Council therefore wished themilitary experts to consider the situation in the light ofthe British offer,      I made plain the logical conclusion ofthe attitude* taken up by the President of Council.      If. wewere to delay action for fear of provoking the Germans suchaction mv.st inevitably be too late.

40     From the ensuing discussion between the C.I.G.S,,Commander--in-Chief Middle East and Air Officer Commandingon the one hand; and General Papagos on the other hand, itemerged that in view of the doubtful attitude of Yugoslaviathe only line that could^neJidL and would give time forwithdraw;;, of troops from Albania would be a line west of theVardar, Olympus-Veria-Edessa-Ea jmakcalan.      If we could besure of Yugoslav moves it should be possible to hold a linefurther north from the mouth of the Nestos&quot; to Beles coveringSalonica^      It would be impracticable, unless Yugoslaviacame in., to hold a line covering Salonica in view ofexposure of Greek left flank to German attack,,5o      In full agreement with the Greek Government thefollowing d tailed decisions were reached;(a) In view of the importance of the Yugoslavattitu.de as affecting the deployment of troops in Greece,it was agreed that I should make a further effort toattempt to persuade the Yugoslav Government to play their part (see my telegrams Nosa 68 and 69).(b) TVnt the Greeks should at once make, and begin the execution of, preparations to withdraw the advance troops to the line which we should have to hold if the Yugoslavswere not willing to come in.(c) That work should immediately be started onimproving communications in Greece to facilitate theoccupation of this line...d)   That the movement of British troops should beginforthwith.- time being the main essence of the problem.      Theutmost secrecy to be preserved and deceptive strategemdevised,-,(e) The Greek   Government agreed to employ thePolish brigade,(f) As regards the command of the British troops, theGreek Government readily accepted our proposal that theBritish General Officer  Commanding should be under theimmediate authority of General Papagos but that, in theevent o?  &amp;*f only, the British General Officer Commandinghad the right to refer to the  Cbmmander-in-Chief middle east and through him to His Majesty&apos;s Government.      Thesuggestion that General Wilson should be the commander wasvery warmly received and went far to remove the latentsuspicion that the size of our force might be inadequate.(g) We raised the question of the moment at whichGreece should break off relations with Germany and internGermans, pointing out the danger from the point of view ofmilitary security and Fifth Column activities constituted bythe Germans at large in Greece.     The Greeks might think theappropriate moment was when the German formations enteredBulgaria or perhaps not unless and until they crossedBulgaria ard the Greek frontier.     Much, clearly, would depend on the attitude of the Turks,      I did not press for an answer on this point and it was agreed that the GreekGovernment should give the matter further consideration.

(h)   Turkey.      It was agreed that in approaching the Turkish Government our object would be to persuade theTurks to reaffirm their assurances that they would come intothe war (a) if Greece were invaded or (b) better still ifformations entered Bulgaria.     Greek Government were,however, dubious of offensive unsupported by Turkey in earlier stages of the war.      They attach more importanceto the attitude of Yugoslavia.6.      The discussions have lasted some ten hours andhave covered the main points of political and military co-operation-operation.   - President of the Council read to me atoutset declaration of loyalty of Greek Government to our common cause (see my telegram No.  263).     We were allimpressed by frankness and fair dealing of Greekrepresentatives on all subjects discussed.      I am quite sure that it is their determination to resist to theutmost of their strength and that His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthas no alternative but to back them whatever the ultimateconsequences.     While recognizing the risks we must accept them.

p abo/ This telegram is of particular secrecy and should be       ^retained by the authorised recipient and not passed on.^SPECIAL (EDEN).Decypher.    Sir M. Palairet (Athens).22nd February, 1941.D. 12.15 P-m. 23rd February, 1941.R.    3.40 p.m. 2Jrd February, 1941.   -No. 263.IMPORTANT.  -My telegram No. 262.Following for Sir A. Cadogan from Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.Following is summary of written declaration givento me by President of the Council at outset of our meetingtoday.    Text follows by bag.I desire to repeat most categorically that Greece, asa faithful ally, is determined to go on fighting with allher forces until final victory.      This determination is not limited to the case of Italy but will apply to any german aggression.2. Greece has only three divisions in Macedonia on the bulgarian frontier.    Consequently a purely military problemarises of what reinforcements should be sent to enable theGreek army to resist the German.    While more or lessaccurate information is available about German forces in roumania and about forces mobilised in Bulgaria, the GreekGovernment for their part so far only know what Britishhelp might be given to them within a period of a month&apos;s time.    Moreover they do not know what are the intentions ofTurkey and Yugoslavia.      In these circumstances, YourExcellency1s arrival in the Middle East is of the greatesthelp not only for the purpose of clarifying the situation,but also of turning it to the common advantage of GreatBritain and Greece.3- I desire to repeat once again that whatever the outcome and whether Greece has or has not any hope ofrepulsing the enemy in Macedonia, she will defend hernational territory, even if she can only count on her own forces.
