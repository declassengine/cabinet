Japan will probably take advantage of her role asmediator between the Thais and the French to gain &quot;basesfrom which to threaten Malaya,  the Netherlands Bast indies,North Borneo and possibly Burma.4. With these bases in her hands we think that Japan will probably select the Netherlands Bast Indies as herfirst objective, and that any move she makes will be timedto fit in with a German major offensive.Tin? eat from Japanese bases.... in Indo-China and Thailand.5* The extent of the threat to British interests fromJapanese bases in Indo-china and Thailand is summarised below:-Indo-china.(a)   RPHts^-An. Southern Indo-China.Kam Rahh Bay, which has tne only first classanchorage in the .South China Sea, excluding Britishand United States possessions, would be available asan advanced base for a sea-torne attack on Malaya, oron British North Borneo.      Japanese naval forcesbased on Kara Ranh Bay would be on the flank of theline of sea communication joining Singapore andManila and would threaten this supply line whichmight be of considerable importance to the UnitedStates in the event of war.* WoM6 (41) 15 Conclusions.- kin.  4.

Communications southward are good and the Japanese could maintain some 6-8divisions as a striking forcer(iii)        The air reinforcement route between Indiaand Malaya would probably be cut.(iv)       A Japanese base at Singora, which, is on theroad and railway, would afford a means of supply to ports on the West coast of Thailand,  such asMuang Trang which is also connected by rail toBangkok.      These communications might beused for maintaining enemy raiders in theIndian OeeancNumerous refuges exist on the WestThailand coast from which,  if supplies couldbe made available, Japanese raiders,,  includingheavy ships,  could operate against our sea communications;  particularly at the northernentrance to the Malacca Straits,Conclusions-,con croa.6. Prom the above it is clear that Japaneseover Indo-China alone would, &quot;bring the threat of attack on british possessions nearer hut would not in itself directly affect our vital interests,      It would increase the ability of the Japanese to control the South China Sea and threaten the line of communication.hetweeh Singapore and- Manila0This would he in accordance with Japan&apos;s traditionalstep-by-step policy,  and would almost certainly lead tothe acquisition, of bases in Thailando .. ...7.     .
