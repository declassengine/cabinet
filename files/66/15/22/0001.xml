W.P. (41) 49.THE Prime Minister has instructed me to ask that the attached paper shallbe returned to the Offices of the War Cabinet immediately after perusal.E. E. BRIDGES.March 12, 1941.22266a

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  March 1941.SECEET.Copy No.W.P. (41) 49.March 3, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF AIRCRAFT ANDAERO-ENGINES.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.DEVELOPMENT is necessarily a slow and lengthy process. Many of thebenefits which can be shown at present reflect only the efforts of years past.This account of the development activities of the Ministry of aircraft production must therefore be regarded as a statement of work in progress ratherthan a record of achievement for which we are entitled to praise.If credit is due, it must be given to the Air Ministry and to the staff whichwe took over from that Ministry. It has been our good fortune to inherit theservices of able and enthusiastic officers. It has been our duty to foster and encourage the continuing exploration of many channels of experiment.For, if the production of aircraft is our business, the development of new types is our absorbing passion.The main objectives of this work of research and development have been : to build bigger bombers,to achieve higher speeds in fighters,to attain greater altitudes, andto develop night-fighting aircraft.Aircraft.With these purposes in mind, six new aircraft have been brought intooperational use since the Ministry was formed : Fighters  Heavy Bombers Beaufighter I. Stirling.Fulmar. Halifax.Whirlwind. Manchester.. The Beaufighter, adaptation of a long-range fighter design, represents the recognition of the urgent importance of night-fighting and of the need to developspecial aircraft for this purpose.   The Fulmar is the first modern fleet fighter.With the three bombers, the problem that had to be met and solved was thatof take-off.  Each can carry three tons of bombs to Berlin.Two aircraft, representing improvements in type, have been put into service,the Hurricane II and the Spitfire V. The Hurricane II is engined by theMerlin XX, the Spitfire V by the Merlin XLV Both give better performance athigher altitudes.Trials on one aircraft, the Typhoon, our fastest interceptor fighter, have beencompleted in the same period, but the machine is not yet in service.[22266]
Seven aircraft have had their first flight since the Ministry was formed : The Mosquito is a complete reversal of what has been the line of development in aircraft construction. For it is built of wood, not of metal. It carries noarmour. It is lightly armed. It depends for its defence upon speed at highaltitudes.   Its performance in service is awaited with immense interest.The Wellington V is a stratosphere bomber, promising, but still to be proved.So far as aircraft are concerned, then, development over the last nine months has covered a field of sixteen new or improved types.The problems of speed and higher altitudes are. in large measure, problemsof the improved exploitation of the power-unit.Five new types of engine have either been put into service since this ministry was formed, or have been brought near to that point :-The Merlin XX has a higher general performance than any previous engineof this type.   It will be our standard general replacement unit.In the Merlin XLV we have had a most fortunate development. It matchesthe Merlin XX in altitude performance, but, unlike it, can be fitted to the existingSpitfire and Hurricane. We look to it to give us our quickest improvement infighter performance this spring.The Vulture is a combination of two smaller engines built on one crankcase.It develops higher horse-power than either of the Merlins, but is excelled in thisrespect by the Sabre, an engine which has the additional advantage of low headresistance. The Hercules VIII, now undergoing experimental tests, is the first two-stage supercharger engine for stratosphere flying.Rolls Royce are being encouraged to experiment with a type of engine whichoperates air screws rotating in opposite directions.. The Merlin XLV +, which I saw at the Rolls Royce Works last week, is nowundergoing experimental tests at Boscombe Down.   The results are remarkable.It is held by some that we are approaching the limits of improvement to be afforded by developing the internal combustion engine. So there must be excep-tional interest over the Whittle Jet Propulsion Engine, embodying a revolutionaryconception in design. In a few weeks this engine will be tested in a specialairplane.From the first day the Ministry of Aircraft Production was formed, enquiry and experiment, research and development has been pursued with restless zeal.There has been no restriction or limitation.Every phase of aircraft and air equipment has been explored andexploited to the full. And the results will, we believe, justify all the labour thathas been spent and all the disappointment that has been endured.Fighters Beaufighter II.Mosquito (P.R.U.)Miles Fighter.Tornado.Bombers Barracuda (torpedo bomber).Lancaster.Wellington V.Engines.Merlin XX and Merlin XLV.Vulture.Sabre.Hercules VIII.
