Printed for the Cabinet, March, 1941--&quot; Copy No. &amp; &amp;W.P.   (41) 72 /20i/&amp; March, 1941 TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINETSTATUS AND FUTURE EMPLOYMENT OF THE A.T.S.MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. For some time I have been considering the question of giving fullermilitary status to the Auxiliary Territorial Service. This is one aspect of a widereview of the conditions of service of this womens&apos; corps, a review which has as its object to attract recruits to the corps in order to make up the seriousdeficiencies in its establishment. At the same time, I am anxious to tighten upthe conditions of enrolment of the corps to something approximating more to theterms of service of the soldier. There is a pronounced shortage, as my colleaguesknow, in the womens&apos; organizations of all three fighting services, and to someextent the remedies which the three Service Departments are seeking are on thecommon lines suggested by a common problem.2. The matter has been brought to a head by proposals made in the reportof Air Marshal Sir Philip Jouberfs Committee on anti-aircraft re-organization, to utilise members of the A.T.S. for duties of an operational nature in connectionwLh the Air Defences of Great Britain. The Joubert Committee, impressed with the need for economising man-power in the period that lies ahead,propose that members of the A.T.S. should be trained and employed in anumber of duties in gun operational r61es such as Track Recorders, Plotters,Teleprinter Operators, etc.,^nol &quot;aTso&quot;as&quot;xomplete reliefs for soldiers as Fire ControlOperators at gun sites ; further, the Committee consider women might appropriately be used for complete Searchlight detachments. It is estimated that in this waythe services of some 30,000 women could be quickly utilised with advantage, withappreciable easing of our man power problem, which is becoming more and moreinsistent, and that eventually some 100,000 women would be employed withA.D.G.B. on operational and other roles.The W.A.A.F are already largely employed on many similar types of duty inoperation rooms, etc., but the suggested employment of A.T.S. members inoperational rdles on gun and searchlight sites goes, I believe, further than anythingnow existing in the women&apos;s corps.3. At the present time the A.T.S. are short of some 20,000 on their existingestablishment of 60,000. To meet the needs of the operational roles in which their employment is now suggested, that establishment would have to be largely increased. In my view, however, if the matter were put before the women ofthis country in the right way, and with the necessary degree of publicity, I think we might hope for such a response as would give us the numbers we should require.There would be some administrative problems involved, for instance accommoda-tion. but they can be surmounted. The appeal to the intelligent woman of theright type inherent in taking a soldier&apos;s place in a unit directly defending thiscountry against attack from the air should be a very powerful one.4. Under British Military Law members of the A.T.S. are technicallycivilians, though from the point of view of International Law I understand thatthey would probably be regarded as &quot;combatants&quot; under the Hague Conventionif engaged on operational duties.   It is my object to give the women&apos;s Corps a
fuller military status, and I am advised that this can be achieved by a defence regulation (without legislation) which would sufficiently define them as part ofthe Armed Forces of the Crown, and would enable the Board of Admiralty, theArmy Council, and the Air Council to prescribe the extent, if any, to which the discipline Acts of the three Services should apply to the women&apos;s corps. So faras concerns the A.T.S., it will be for consideration whether it is necessary to treatoperational and non-operational personnel alike.If this fuller military status is given to the women&apos;s corps, I shall consider at the same time the tightening-up of the conditions of their service, so that(e.g., in the case of the A.T.S.) they would no longer be able, without penalty,to terminate their services practically at will. For them to be able to do so would be incompatible with the holding of essential operational roles in defence units. The code of discipline applicable to them will also need reconsiderationfrom this point of view.If a Defence Regulation giving full military status to the A.T.S. is obtained,I think it would have to apply also to all full-time women&apos;s military services,i.e. women doctors, nurses, etc. Officers in these corps would probably have tobe given commissions (while keeping their present titles and rank), but their powers of command would not extend outside their own respective services.5. The problem is not an entirely novel one; we were faced with manysimilar aspects over the Home Guard, who are, like the women&apos;s corps, anenrolled and not an enlisted force, having their own officers and forming part ofthe Armed Forces of the Crown, while at the same time not subject in full to themilitary code of discipline and military conditions of service.6. I do not at present make any further proposals for improving the emoluments of members of the A.T.S. or for financial improvements in their conditions of service, though it may be that something more than the concessionsrecently asked for, and conceded in part (e.g. Dependants&apos; Allowance, increase of higher ranks, etc.) while some are still under consideration, will be necessary ifwe are to attract the necessary numbers. The combination of military status and the patriotic appeal which the prospect of these employments should make to the women of this country will, I hope, result in an appreciable easing of theman-power situation, which is increasingly pre-occcupying the Minister of Labourand National Service, as well as my colleagues and myself at the head of theService Departments.I ask the approval of the War Cabinet to the principle of giving fullermilitary status to members of the A.T.S., and to their employment on operationalroles of the kind I have mentioned above.D.
