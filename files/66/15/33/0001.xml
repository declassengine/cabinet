(rpms DOCUMENT..IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS PR&quot;&quot;TA^TZ C MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENTYSEC RE TW.P.(41)60.16TH MARCH,  1941. COPY NO2 0WAR CABINET.PRESENTATION OP THE LINCOLN COPY OF THE MAGKA CHARTA TOTHE AMERICAN NATION.Note by Parliamentary under Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs0The Lease-Lend Act which was -passed on the 11th of Marchrepresents a landmark in the history of liberty.     Under its provisions the British Empire stands to he the principal bene-ficiary.      It would bo peculiarly fitting if at this juncture wewere to offer a copy of the Magna Charta, which has been on view in America for about two years, to the American Nation.      Thiscopy is already familiar to many thousands of Americans, whohave waited daily in long queus to view it with a reverence andpride scarcely believable to those who have not visited theBritish Pavilion of the New York World Fair, where it has beenexhibited.This copy, stated to be in the best state of preservationio normally in the care of the Dean and Chapter of LincolnCathedral.      There are said to exist four original copies of theMagna Charta,  of which two are in the British Museum,&quot;    Thefourth is the Salisbury copy.      It Is suggested that his majesty&apos;s Government should approach the Dean and Chapter ofLincoln with a request that they should relinquish theirtitle to their copy,  since a direct gift to America by theDean and Chapter would not bo as effective as one made inthe name of the Nation.It is suggested that the Dean and Chapter of LincolnCathedral be compensated by the presentation of one of the twocopies in the British Museum.      To effect this transfer I .understand that it would be necessary to introduce a Billin Parliament.      A further suggestion has been made that theDean and Chapter should be offered a sum. in war bonds tov/ards. -the upkeep of the Cathedral.If the gift is to bo mo.de, it would seem suitable to choose this present psychological moment.      Particularly &apos;so, since the Prime Minister mentioned Magna Carta in his recent statement to Parliament,     -Opportunity could be takento state that we were responding to the passage of the lease-Lend Bill, making a provision for material help to ourselves, by presenting to the American people a symbol ofthe history and traditions which the two countries have inc common.(intld)..
