31 .-lJ2QCrJMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY.-S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.ECJ E T.  .....-r  COPY NO.   O&quot; u is r th it special care may be taken top. (41) 52. u    u.e secrecy of This document.fch March, 1941.WAR    CABINET.ANTI-GAS MEASURES.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security.In the paper W.P.(41) 44 which was considered at the meetingof the War Cabinet on the 3rd March (W.M.(41), 22nd Conclusions,Item 6) I proposed that a statement of policy should be made onthe following, lines;    that -(i) we regard the gas weapon with abhorrence andwill in no circumstances be the first to make use of It;(ii) we cannot rely upon our enemy&apos;s undertakings notto use it as proof that he will not in fact do so;(iii) if he does he may count upon powerful and immediateretaliation;    but(iv) it behoves us to take full defensive measures for the safety of the civilian population, which must itselfco-operate by carrying and practising with its gasmasks and obeying other instructions given to it.The War Cabinet approved in principle the issue of a statement ofpolicy on the lines of (i),   (ii) and (iv) but decided that for thepresent no threat of retaliation should be made, as suggested in(iii).     I was also invited to circulate a further report settingcut the practical measures which I propose to take.In accordance with these Conclusions I am now circulating areport of the measures which, after consultation with theMinisters concerned, I propose should be taken to induce thepublic to carry their gas masks, to practise wearing them and generally to familiarise themselves with anti-gas measures.-1.    The first measure is a public statement on&apos; behalf of theGovernment.      I attach the draft of a Parliamentary statement which would be followed immediately by a broadcast based on it.2.    I propose that the Whips should be invited to circularizeMembers of both Houses of Parliament asking them to set an exampleby carrying their gas masks.      Appropriate instructions should beissued to staffs of Government Departments and also of LocalAuthorities.3.    The various Government Departments concerned, e.g. the supply departments, the Ministry of Transport and, for the general bodyof industry, the Ministry of Labour through the Factory Inspectoralshould communicate with the firms and undertakings subject to their jurisdiction and ask them to co-operate in securing that their

staffs and employees bring their gas masks to work with them an increase arranging that at regular intervals everyone puts on his gasmask and&apos;practises wearing it for a short time.      It is notrecommended at this stage that disciplinary action should betaken if a man fails to bring his gas mask to work or that heshould be sent back to get it, with possible loss of productivetime.Similar action should be continued by the Board of Educatioin respect of schools, and by Local Authorities in respect ofthe people who resort to public shelters at night.4.    The Ministry of Home Security should communicate on similar lines with the appropriate bodies representing commercial interests and retail trade.i.    In a number of towns it is already the practice of places oentertainment to require the public to bring their gas masks withem.      It is proposed that the Ministry of Home Security shouloommunicate with the entertainment interests (including theFootball Association and Greyhound Racing Authorities)  asking them all to adopt the practice.6,   With regard to general publicity, I indicated the measuresI have in mind in paragraph 6 of&apos; my memorandum (W.P0(4l) 44) ofthe 2&apos;7th February.      The two points I would particularly emphasare regular gas mask drills and practical exorcises undertakenthe Local Authorities to bring in not only the Civil Defence Sobut also the public.H.M.)MS OFFICE,Whitehall, S.W.I.

DRAFT PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT.The use of gas is abhorrent to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentraid this country will in no circumstances be the first to employthe gas weapon.No attention need be paid to any attempt by the enemy tocast doubts on our attitude, or to suggest that our defensive measures imply some intention to take the initiative.Unhappily we cannot put any faith in statements which theenemy has made that he will not use gas.      On the contrary hiswhole past record shows that he will stop at nothing, and thatif he conceives the use of gas to be of military advantage tohim, he will use it.For that reason it is essential that the country should beprepared.      Full use must be made of the provision that theGovernment has already made for the defence of the civilpopulation - the civilian gasmask - which when properly usedgives full protection against any known war gas.      The Goverrim.cnis taking fresh steps to ensure that every member of thepopulation carries, practises with and is in every respectfamiliar with the use of his gasmask.      Exercises and propagandawill be used to this end, and the Government will seek to obtainthe widest possible co-operation in helping to achieve the desiraim.I would emphasise that with proper measures of protectionsuch as are now available to the population there is no ground for serious alarm about the effect of gas attack, provided always that proper precautions are taken, and that the publicobeys the advice given to it.     For that reason the Governmentis determined to ensure that the whole population is in a fullstate of preparedness.
