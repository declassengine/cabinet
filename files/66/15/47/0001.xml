THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS britannic .JES TY1 S GOVERNMENT.SECRET.W.P*(4l)  74. COPY NO.     &apos; 6&quot;WAR CABINET_(4l)-.ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION INTO PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I feel that my colleagues should he aware ofthe following facts,  though the action I am taking isalready covered by a Cabinet decision.On the 19th March the S.S.&quot;DARIEN&quot;,  of 300 tonsgross, flying the Panama Flag, was intercepted off thePalestine coast and brought to Haifa.    There were 793passengers on board, coal for two days and food and water for three daysc      Though the ship was grossly overcrowded,conditions were not so bad as they might have been.The Cabinet will remember that when last november it was decided as an exceptional act of grace toallow the passengers on the S.S.&quot;PATRIA&quot; - sabotaged atHaifa - to remain in Palestine,  it was also decided &quot;thatin future all other illegal immigrants attempting toenter Palestine should be diverted to Mauritius or elsewhere.The consideration which doubtless prompted theCabinet&apos;s decision still applies.     Any relaxation of theban on illegal immigration would be likely to cause aflood of gate crashers owing to the desire of the Nazisto get rid of Jews and the efforts of the Zionists tobreak down our policy of which the control and limitationof immigration is an essential foundation.I am therefore arranging for this new shiploadto be sent on to Mauritius as soon as transport can beprovided for themo      I am sure that, as in the previouscase, the Governor of Mauritius will make very goodarrangements for their reception and that they will bewell treated and comfortably housed.,M.Colonial Office,28th March,
