(41) 98)February 13, 1941TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCKf AND KEY.It is requested that special caW Jiay be taken toensure the secrecy of thii^document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 76)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon February 6th, to12 noon February 13th,1941[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Copy No.   28/Cabinet War Room
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.Heavy ships have carried out a successful bombardment of Genoa. Ostendwas also bombarded by a 15-inch monitor.Shipping between the Azores and Cape St. Vincent has been attacked byFocke-Wulfe aircraft and by a surface raider. Losses reported during the weekshow a decrease.The Suez Canal has been reopened.Home Waters.2. At noon on the 8th February H.M.S. Ramillies, escorting an eastboundconvoy from Halifax, sighted the mast and top of a warship, possibly of theHipper Class, 900 miles west of Ireland and steering N.N.E. Extensivedispositions were made to intercept her, but she was not again sighted.H.M.S. Neptune was attacked by a Dornier aircraft on 9th whilst off the thames Approaches. She received slight damage from a near-miss bomb andfrom machine-gun fire, but suffered no casualties and severely damaged theaircraft.H.M. Submarine Sealion attacked two enemy merchant ships in the vicinity of Stadlandet on the 1st February and one hit was possibly made. On the 5thshe attacked a Norwegian merchant ship and hit with one torpedo. Afterevacuating the passengers and crew she set the ship on fire with gunfire.H.M. Monitor Erebus escorted by three destroyers and assisted by spottingaircraft, carried out a bombardment of the Ostend dock area during the night10th/11th. Shells were seen to burst in the target area and in the new pens and several fires were started. The bombardment was preceded by a bombing attack by six aircraft.   No enemy action was encountered during this operation.H.M. Drifter Eager destroyed a German Ju. 88 which attacked her in the thames&apos;Estuary on 12th.North Atlantic.3. H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Letitia ran aground in thick weather in the Halifax Approach on the 7th February. She was subsequently refloatedand towed to Halifax.Mediterranean.4. A force composed of H.M. Ships Renown, Malaya, Ark Royal, Sheffieldand destroyers carried out a successful bombardment of Genoa at dawn on the9th February. Fire was opened at 0714 and continued till 0744, during whichperiod 337 rounds of 15-inch and over 1,000 rounds of lighter calibre were fired.Large fires were observed in Ansaldo electric and boiler works, the main power station, the dry docks and round the inner harbour; hits were also observed on oil cisterns, marshalling yards and merchant ships. The only enemy oppositionencountered was ineffective fire from about two 6-inch guns and slightanti-aircraft fire against spotting aircraft. At the same time Fleet Air Armaircraft from Ark Royal laid mines in Spezia harbour and bombed Leghorn andPisa aerodrome and railway junction. Two enemy aircraft were shot down andone Swordfish is missing. During the withdrawal the force was attacked by two enemy bombers which dropped four bombs, the nearest of which fell 1,500 yardsfrom the nearest ship. The visibility decreased towards noon and the force wasnot again located. There was no damage to any of our ships, which returned to gibraltar without further incident.5. A south-east bound convoy of three merchant vessels escorted by twotorpedo boats was unsuccessfully attacked bv H.M. Submarine Ursula 50 miles .E. of Sfax P.M. on the 8th.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. Five attacks were made on U-Boats, of which two were by surface craft and three by aircraft.    One of the latter, carried out in the North-West
Approaches southward of Rockail, was possibly successful, but there was no visibleresult in the case of the remainder.Enemy Intelligence.German.7.   The battleship Bismarck was reported at Gdynia on the 6th February.Previous mention has been made in this report of the sighting of the mastand top of a warship, possibly of a Hipper Class, in the North Atlantic onthe 8th, and probably a Hipper Class cruiser attacked a convoy westward of cape St. Vincent on the 12th. In addition, a report was made by aircraft onthe 9th of a heavy ship described as a Hipper Class cruiser escorted by three destroyers south of the Lister Light steering into the Kattegat.There has been considerable destroyer activity off the Norwegian Coast duringthe week.Italian.8. The battleship Giulio Cesare was not at Genoa at the time of the bombardment on the 9th, and she has not yet been located.Submarines.The position has been obscure owing to the small scale of activity, but it isestimated that five or six German submarines and two Italian have operated inthe North-West Approaches and one German in the Azores area.Ice Conditions.Baltic Sea.9. Stockholm is being kept open with difficulty. German ports, with theexception of Memel and Danzig, are closed. Fehmarn and Cadet Channels are probably impracticable, and the Kiel Canal is closed, so that the shipping nowin Kiel Bay is inoperative. If present mild weather in this area continues, the canal may re-open in a fortnight.Approaches to Baltic Sea.Probably almost continuous ice within 20 miles of the North Coast of denmark and much drift ice further out in the Skagerrak, particularly at theEastern end. The Kattegat is navigable near the Swedish coast. Shipping canreach the Northern end of the Sound, but the Southern end is closed. It is improbable that any shipping can get to the Baltic except strongly-built shipskeeping close behind an icebreaker.North Sea.Off Germany and the West coast of Denmark ice is present up to the10-fathom line and drift ice or floes up to the 15-fathom line. The ice situation inthe German rivers is so serious now that it must be difficult even to keep the Elbeopen, if indeed it is not already closed; at a similar period last year the Elbe was closed above Cuxhaven, and cruisers and heavy ships of the German Navy were observed to be at anchor off Heligoland.  Emden is icebound.No ice on the West coast of Norway. On the South coast a fair amount of iceyvithin three miles of the coast and in the longer fjords.-Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.10. During the period the 6th to 12th February, 17 ships, a total of 50,944tons, have been reported sunk and of these 12 ships (37,540 tons) were British.- Seven ships (26,530 tons) were sunk by U-Boat and nine (23,913 tons) by aircraft. One small vessel was sunk off the East Coast by enemy E-Boat. Therewere no losses from mines,Thirteen ships are reported damaged, including nine British; of the total,eight were damaged by air attack and five by mine.       &quot;[22225] ;   ,,. b
A homeward-bound convoy from Gibraltar was attacked by U-Boat .160 miles.S.W. of Cape St. Vincent early a.m. on the 9th February and two british ships were sunk. Later in the d&amp;y this convoy was attacked by six Focke-Wulfeaircraft and two more British and one Norwegian were sunk, and one shipdamaged.A homeward-bound convoy from Sierra Leone was shelled by a surface raider,probably a Hipper Class cruiser, 640 miles West of Cape St. Vincent at 1135 onthe 12th February. An ocean boarding vessel has picked up survivors from two british and a Greek ship, but full details are not yet available.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending Wednesday, 12th February, 853 ships, including140 Allied and 22 Neutral, were convoyed of which six were lost. Since thecommencement of hostilities the number of vessels convoyed has been 52,940,including 6,136 Allied and 4,371 Neutral of which 230, including 30 Allied and19Neutral, have been lost. This gives ratios of losses to numbers convoyed ofBritish 1 in 234, Allied 1 in 207, Neutral 1 in 230, total 1 in 230.One battleship, two cruisers, six armed merchant cruisers, forty-six destroyers, forty-two sloops and corvettes and one submarine were employed on escort duties.12. Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during this week totalled465,409 tons compared with 419,826 tons last week. Oil imports were considerablysmaller, only four tankers having brought in 43,139 tons compared with 112,598tons last week, but there was an increase in cereals which totalled 60,490 tons as compared with 29,269 tons. Other food imports amounted to 119,883 tons compared with 39,547 tons in the previous week. Two ships were fully laden withmolasses, three with fruit chiefly citrus and sour oranges and one with west african produce. A considerable quantity of meat was brought in, and 20,475tons of sugar. Mineral imports amounted to 164,208 tons, the corresponding figure for last week being 148,949 tons. Eight ships had full cargoes of iron ore,two carried sulphur, one was fully laden with pyrites and one with steel. cotton and wool imports totalled 23,635 tons, but timber amounted to only 4,000 tons.General cargoes and sundries totalled 50,054 tons, and there were satisfactoryquantities of aeroplanes, engines, spare parts, trucks, field kitchens, heavy liftsand ammunition.British Minelaying.13. On the 6th February, H.M. Minelayers Southern Prince and PortQuebec laid 1,110 mines between the Faroe Islands and Iceland, and on the11th February H.M. Minelayer Plover laid 120 deep mines in the St. George&apos;s channel. Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out on the North-West coast of Germany. Motor torpedo boats laid mines off the Belgian Coast on the night of the 6th/7th February.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.14. Minelaying enemy aircraft have been more active during the last weekthan during the previous weeks. On the East Coast the Humber has been visitedseveral times, and mines have been seen to drop off the Norfolk and Suffolkcoasts; parachutes were also reported dropping off Aberdeen. On the WestCoast raiding aircraft have ranged from the Bristol Channel area, includingMilford Haven, to as far north as Campbeltown in Kintyre, baking in the MenaiStraits, Holyhead, and Liverpool Bay. On two nights, the 7th/8th and11th/ 12th February, there was apparently no minelaying.Minesweepers in the Humber on the 11th February detonated 27 mines, ofwhich 18 were acoustic and 9 magnetic.A high-speed motor launch was slightly damaged when she put up anacoustic mine in the entrance to the Wash on the 8th February. This is the firstmine reported in the Wash area.
There have been only three casualties in Home Waters this week, one beingthe M.L. mentioned above.   No ships were sunk.During the week L.L. Sweeps have detonated 1 mine in the Firth of Forth,19 in the Humber, 1 in the Thames Estuary, 2 off Plymouth, 1 in the bristol channel, and 3 off Campbelltown. S.A. Gear Type A have detonated 12 acousticmines in the Humber, 2 in the Thames Estuary, 7 in the Bristol Channel, 8 offLiverpool, and 3 off Workington; S.A. Gear Type C have detonated 6 acousticmines in the Humber, and 5 off Milford Haven.It has been decided to revise the total number of mines and to count only those ground mines (magnetic and acoustic) which have actually been detonatedby sweeping craft. Up to now mines dropped on the foreshores, exploded bypassing H.M. Ships, &amp;c, have been counted, but these are now being excluded.The revised figures, including this week&apos;s sweepings, are, therefore : acoustic 168,magnetic 900, contact 798.The searched channels at Liverpool for inward- and outward-bound vesselshave been extended about 8 miles to the westward so as to cover more of thewater liable to be acoustically mined.Foreign Waters.15. Mines were dropped in the Suez Canal again on the 3rd, 4th and 5th February. After the Ranee, 5,060 tons, was mined on the 5th February traffic was again stopped except for tugs and small craft. The next day a MinesweepingHopper and a Canal Hopper were mined and a skid detonated one mine,whereupon traffic was stopped again until the 9th February, when tugs and small craft were allowed to proceed freely throughout the Canal. Southbound ships,including one of 15,000 tons, were allowed to proceed to Suez on the 11th February,and northbound traffic was to start on the 12th February. Sixteen mines havebeen accounted for in the Canal and six were dropped along the shores.German aircraft are reported to have laid mines off Tobruk and Sollum.  .Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.16. The s.s. Tannenfels, 7,840 tons, is reported to have left Kismayu in italian Somaliland between the 30th January and the 5th February, and thes.s. Uckermark, 7,021 tons, and the s.s. Askari, 590 tons, have also left. Thes.s. Uckermark was intercepted at sea on the 12th February. She attempted toscuttle herself and is unlikely to remain afloat. Thirty-seven prisoners have beentaken. The only other German ship known to have been at Kismayu recentlywas the s.s. Kionga, 192 tons. The s.s. Tannenfels may be masquerading as aDutch freighter under charter to the P. &amp; O. S.N. Company.A document taken from the Captain of the Rhein when she was capturedrecently proved that she was under direct orders from the German Admiralty.German-Controlled Danish Shipping,17. Two Danish tankers, the Christian Holm, 9,919 tons, and the Scandia,8,571 tons, which had been at St. Thomas in the United States Virgin Islandssince last May, were intercepted by H.N.M.S. Van Kinsbergen at daybreak onthe 5th February eleven miles out.  They were taken in prize to Trinidad.Italian.18. The Italian merchant vessels Aclria (3,809 tons), Erminia Mazzela(5,742 tons), Savoia (5,490 tons), and Manon (5,597 .tons) were captured off thesouth coast of Italian Somaliland on the .11th February by H.M.S. Hawkins andthe Leonardo da Vinci (7,515 tons) on the 12th, the latter being sent intoMombasa with thirty-seven prisoners from the German Uckermark.Four auxiliary schooners were captured during the Libyan operations.An examination of the port of Mogadishu on the 7th showed a completeabsence of shipping, but four ships were reported to be still in Kismayu onthe 12th.
MILITARY SITUATION.Italy.19. Italian military activity has, for the most part, been concerned with the finding of reinforcements for Albania. There have been reports that certainformations were destined for Libya, but no arrivals have been reported of freshtroops at Tripoli.Balkan States.Bulgaria.20. Almost all reports from Bulgaria this week have referred either to thefeverish repairs which are being carried out on roads and bridges in various partsof the country and the special arrangements which have come into force on therailways, or to the mobilisation of the Bulgarian Army. The 1920 class has been called up. There is now no doubt about the mobilisation of the 1st and 9thDivisions and the Railway Regiment, and it is certain that the 1st Division isbeing sent to the Turkish frontier. The Bulgarians intend to build up a strengthof 80,000 men on this frontier, and it is thought that this is being done at therequest of Germany.The weather remains fine and above freezing point in the Sofia and Plovdicareas, while the Black Sea Coast is enjoying warm weather. Little snow is nowleft below 4,000 feet. The main roads are dry, and secondary roads are passablefor normal traffic.The Danube is now clear of ice.Roumania.21. The total number of German divisions in Roumania is now estimated tobe 22 or 23, of which four are armoured, two or three motorised and two mountaindivisions.Africa.Libya.22. Following a lightning advance our troops succeeded in cutting off theenemy line of retreat which resulted in the capitulation of Benghazi on the6th February. The enemy attempted to break out and made a persistent attackwith over 100 tanks, but these were repulsed with heavy losses, including 60 ofthe latter. The full number of prisoners has not yet been ascertained, but it isunderstood that they have surrendered in large numbers, and include an ArmyCommander, a Corps Commander and many other senior officers. Quantities ofwar material of all descriptions have also been captured.On the 8th February our patrols occupied Agheila.23. Now that the whole of northern Cirenaioa is in our hands, nothingremains between our forces and the fertile regions of northern Tripolitania except the long, waterless and inhospitable tracts of the Sirte desert. This in itself,however, is such a formidable obstacle as to represent a very good defence for theremainder of Marshal Graziani&apos;s army, now estimated at 70,000.Sudan.24. In Eritrea the enemy is still holding a position 4 miles West of Keren,where he is being engaged by our troops. Enemy deserters on this front nowtotal 400. On the 8th February our forces reached a position 40 miles Southof Keren. :.-In the North we have occupied Karora and Mersa Taclai.East Africa.25. In Northern Kenya we have made considerable inroads into enemy territory, and have occupied Kunchurro (50 miles North-East of Dukana).In Italian Somaliland our advance troops have gained touch with the enemyat Afmadu (160 miles South-East of Wajir and 75 miles inside Italian territory).The present locations of the Italian forces in Italian East Africa areobscure, as withdrawal is taking place from all the western and south-western
frontiers of the colony. It is estimated that the present garrison of Italian EastAfrica consists of 105,000 white personnel including Blackshirts, and 190,000native personnel including irregulars.AIR SITUATION.General Review.26. With the exception of a heavy attack on Hanover, operations by our home Commands, together with those of the enemy, were at a low level owing toadverse weather.Our aircraft in Libya and Eritrea maintained their harassing attacks inco-operation with our land forces.Aerodromes at Malta, Jannina and Heraklion were attacked by the enemy.An unusually determined raid was made by Italian aircraft on Agordat, butelsewhere in Africa hostile air activity was negligible.Operational aircraft battle casualties and extracts from recent Raid Assess-ment Reports are given in Appendices VI and VII.Germany and Occupied Territory.27. Bomber Command flew 32 sorties by day and 524 by night, and coastal command 18 by day and 15 by night. Stirling heavy bombers have been in action for the first time. Heavier bombs (1,000 lb. and 1,900 lb.) are being used in increasing quantities.28. By day, repeated attacks were made on Invasion Ports, and barges and shipping were hit. On two days, large formations of fighters escorted medium bombers on several offensive sweeps of the Calais, Dunkirk and Boulogne areas,during which the ports were successfully bombed and two or more enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat; we lost four fighters, but the pilot of one is safe.Fighters, unaccompanied by bombers, also carried out similar sweeps on otherdays. Coastal Command aircraft attacked shipping at Kristiansand South anda v/ireless station building nearby was straddled with bombs. The seaplane base at Thisted (Jutland) was successfully attacked,29. Weather conditions were unfavourable during most of the week, but onthe 10th/11th February, in clear weather, our heaviest night operation of the war was carried out. Two hundred and eighty-four aircraft were employed, including three Stirlings operating for the first time, and each carrying-8,000 lbs. weightof bombs; four aircraft were lost. During a raid lasting six hours, 146 tonsof high explosive and 25,500 incendiary bombs were dropped on the industrialcentre of Hanover and many large fires were left blazing in the target area.Rotterdam petrol harbour was also heavily and effectively bombed and Cherbourgand Ostend were attacked by aircraft of Coastal Command. The following night,under conditions of heavy cloud, Hanover was again attacked in addition totargets at Bremen. Owing to sudden deterioration in weather, resulting inwidespread fog, twenty-two heavy bombers of the 109 despatched crashed in.thiscountry on return, but only one crew was lost. Other objectives during the.periodincluded oil stocks at Mannheim, aero-engine works at Brunswick and the naval base at Wilhelmshaven.United Kingdom.30. Hostile activity was very restricted and during daylight consistedprincipally of reconnaissances, and isolated attacks on shipping. Enemy fighterpatrols were maintained in the Straits of Dover. At night, small-scale scatteredraids were made overland but no major attacks developed. Those aircraft thatcrossed our coast operated mainly over the East and South-East of England,their primary targets being apparently aerodromes in East Anglia. From a totalof 210 enemy aircraft plotted at night, 115 are suspected of minelaying.31. Fighter Command flew 313 patrols involving 1,043 sorties by day,including the operations over Northern France already described, and 174 patrolsinvolving 231 sorties by night.;V     [22225]     ; &apos; -c
Coastal Reconnaissance, Patrols and Minelaying.32. Bad weather again curtailed the activities of Coastal Command.Patrols numbering 132 and involving 510 sorties were flown, including 276 convoy escorts.33. Sea mines were laid in the Ems River and Hubert Gat, and photographicreconnaissances included Bergen, Wangerooge to Borkum and numerous ports and aerodromes in occupied territory. A number of sightings of enemy vessels,including a cruiser, was reported during reconnaissances of Norwegian waters,and on the 8th and again on the 9th our aircraft attacked destroyers off Norway;on the second occasion an explosion amidships was observed on one of six ofthese ships after a torpedo attack.Two Swordfish assisted in the naval operations against Ostend recorded inthe Naval Situation.34. Enemy minelayers were active, more than half the total aircraft operating at night being so engaged. Long-range offensive reconnaissances bysingle aircraft continued in the Atlantic, and an attack by six Focke Wulfaircraft on a convoy has already been reported.35. On the 9th February an enemy bomber machine-gunned the aerodrome at Kaldadarnes (Iceland), but no damage or casualties resulted.Greece and Albania.36. Three attacks against Tepelene, two against Duki and one on themilitary camp at Elbasan were made by our Blenheims, one of which is missing.Seven Italian fighters were shot down in the Kelcyre area by Gladiators for theloss of one aircraft, the pilot being safe.37. Jannina Aerodrome was severely attacked by enemy aircraft on threesuccessive days. The heaviest raid was made by force of fifty Italian bombers and fighters, two of which were destroyed and six damaged by Gladiators. the aerodrome was rendered unserviceable, and one of our aircraft was destroyed onthe ground and six slightly damaged. Heraklion Aerodrome (Crete) wasmachine-gunned twice by six Italian fighters, one of our aircraft being destroyed.Malta.38. The island was persistently but ineffectively raided by enemy aircraft,which included German bombers and probably fighters. Forty-five bombersmaintained a prolonged attack on the night of the 8th/9th, during which ourHurricanes destroyed two Ju. 88&apos;s and damaged a third; relatively unimportantdamage was sustained at Luqa and Hal Far, though civilian property sufferedconsiderably. On the 12th, two intercepting Hurricanes were lost, but one pilotwas rescued from the sea. Me. 109&apos;s have been reported over Malta, but have notbeen in action.39. Our aircraft reconnoitred Tunis and the coast and sea routes from italy to Tripoli and Benghazi.Italy.40. On the night of the 11th/12th the aerodromes at Comiso and Catania,in Sicily, were attacked with over five tons of bombs by Wellingtons from Malta.At least four enemy aircraft were destroyed at Catania and large fires were started at both aerodromes.41. Enemy transport activity on a considerable scale has been maintained between Sicily, Tripoli, and Sardinia.Egypt and Libya.42. Before Benina fell the aerodrome was bombed and machine gunned, anumber of aircraft being damaged on the ground. One hundred unserviceableaircraft, including two German bombers, were found when our troops occupied
the town. Aerodromes at Berka, where forty aircraft were later. foundabandoned, and Jedabya (90 miles south of Benghazi) were also attacked.Dodecanese.43. Raids were carried out on three nights against aerodromes in Rhodesand at least fifteen enemy aircraft were burnt out. Buildings were hit at OalatO,Maritza and Kattavia, violent explosions following the attacks.Italian East Africa.44. In support of our military offensive, harassing attacks were maintained in the Keren-Asmara sectors. Enemy troops, mechanised transport, railwaystations, trains, bridges and other targets were repeatedly bombed and machine-gunned with marked success.Two Italian fighters were destroyed in combat over Asmara on the 5th, andon the 8th an encounter between two Hurricanes and five Italian aircraft resultedin the destruction of one and probably two enemy fighters.On the 9th Italian fighters machine-gunned our aircraft on three landing grounds at Agordat (Eritrea), destroying eight and damaging two.45. In Abyssinia our aircraft machine-gunned the aerodrome at Bahar Dar,three Italian aircraft being destroyed together with a quantity of petrol. addis ababa aerodrome buildings and ground positions at Dessie were attacked byBlenheims from Aden, which also set on fire eight enemy aircraft on Allomataaerodrome.46. At Afmadu, in Italian Somaliland, aircraft of the South African AirForce dropped six tons of bombs on military targets and machine-gunned enemy positions. .   &apos;Air Intelligence.South-East Europe. .......47. The German Air Force is consolidating its position in Roumania, andan operational command previously located in France is going to Roumania. Upto 500 aircraft will probably be deployed in the country and ready for operations by the 1st March. Preparations in Bulgaria are probably also well advanced, butthe available aerodrome capacity is smaller than in Roumania.China.48. Japanese operations against the Burma Road are apparently nowmeeting with increasing success.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.49.   Very little bombing has occurred by day.On the morning of the 7th February a low level attack was made onFraserburgh, where a gas holder was fired and a number of U.X.B&apos;s. were dropped.That afternoon the swing bridge and harbour works at Lowestoft were damaged and eight people killed.50. During daylight this week a few bombs were dropped harmlessly in the orkneys, Cornwall and the Eastern Counties and there has been occasionalmachine-gun fire.  On the 6th, 9th and 12th February no bombs were dropped.On the 12th February seven houses were seriously damaged by enemy shellfire at and near Ramsgate, but there were no casualties.
By Night.51.   No bombs were dropped on the nights 6th/7th and 7th/8th February.On other nights there were a few bombs, doing little damage and &quot;causingfew casualties. Campbeltown on the night 9th/T0th; Ipswich, other places in.theEastern Counties, and London on the 9th/10th and 10th/ 11th; and Abera,von andPlymouth on the 11th/12th were the areas attacked.Casualties,52. Casualties for the week ending 0600 on the 12th February (including6 killed and 44 seriously injured in London) were 36 killed and 89 seriously injured.  About half of these were caused on the night of the 5th/6th February.
