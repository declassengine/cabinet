COPY NO. jjjI append a note on this subject prepared in the Privy Council Office which I think mycolleagues should have an opportunity of considering&quot;before a final decision is taken.(initialled)     J.A.Privy Council Office.,21ST MiiRCHy  1941o

lo The iroroign Office Memorandum (41)60.) statesthat we possess four original copies of Magna Carta and sasriB to imply that  these are ai.i of equal authority value and importance.      Tnis is far from &quot;being the case.There are at present in existence four copies ofMagna Garta sealed with the great seal of King John and several unsealed copies.      The four sealed copies are -(l) British Museum (a Cotton MS) found in DoverCastle in &quot;1630 and badly damaged by fire    in1731,(2) British Museum (a Cotton MS) undamaged.(3) jSalishury; rOatnedral.(4) Lincoln ..Ca1A.edral.The British Museum also possesses  the originalpar climent of the i^ticles      Jihe Batons.2. Copies  (3) and (4)  are superior to the british museum copies which wore evidently hurriedly prepared.The Lincoln copy has long been regarded by the learnedas more perfect than the other three sealed copies andas the authoritative text,;      when in 1810 the RecordCommission published their edition of the Statutes of the realm and desired to print the best authenticated version of the Charter they stated --&quot;in Lincoln &quot;Cathedral, an original of theGreat Charter of Liberties, granted byKing John in the seventh (sic) year of hisreign, is preserved in a perfect state.This Charter appears to be of superiorauthority to either of the two Charters ofthe same date preserved in the british museum,      from the contemporary endorsement of the word Lincolina on two folds of the charter, this ma*y&quot;be presumed to be the charter transmitted by the hands of Hugh,the then Bishop of Lincoln who is one ofthe Bishops named in the introductory clause&quot;(Introduction XXIX).This view of the great authority of the Lincoln texthas been confirmed by modern research.3. The Lincoln copy is not only &quot;of special interestand importance to the lawyer and historian but it must always be regarded with particular reverence and respectby the Church of ^nglando      In all probability it was this copy which st  Hugh of Lincoln - a great Lnglishman,a great Statesman and a true baint - brought back withhim from Runnymead after having taken a great part inobtaining from the King the confirmation of the principle&apos; quod Anglicana Lcclesia liberation sit1.      The copy has remained aT Lincoln forever 7,00 years.      This specialassociation with the Church of Lngland can have verylittle, if any, significance in the United States.4. If it is thought necessary to present a copy ofMagna Carta to the United States it would be far preferable to give the undamaged copy in the British Museum than thisLincoln archetype with all its peculiarly -uuiglishassociations..
