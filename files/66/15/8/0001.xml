(41) 35. &apos; &apos; &quot; &quot;WAR CABINET.FEBRUARY 18, 1941 .AUTHORITY   TO H.H. SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT. IN THE MEDITERRAiUCANTO SINK MERCHANT SHIPS WITHOUT WARNING-.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Aclmiralty.1 , At present H.M. Ships and aircraft in the Mediterranean are&apos;authorised to attack ships without warning as follows(a) All ships within 30 miles of the Libyan Coast..(b) All enemy ships \riihin 30 miles of Italian territory.(c) All enemy ships South of latitude 350 46&apos; N. off Libya even within Tunisian territorial waters&quot;.A warning has been issued that all vessels navigating within.30 miles of any Italian territory in the Mediterranean will&apos;.-do so at theirown risk, but in practice our forces are limited to the actiondescribed above. .2, I now seek authority to tighten up the existing orders in three ways:(a) H,M. Ships and air cr aft to-be given authority to sinkwithout warning all vessels encountered within 30 miles of the Adriatic Coast of Italy and Albania.This would give us a much better chance of intercepting theimportant military supplies now being carried to Albania inJugo-Slav ships.     No further, notification to Neutralswould be required.     Jugo-Slav waters would not be infringedand our patrols would be warned not to attack any Jugo-Slavship passing through the Adriatic with our approval.     Noother neutral ships normally sail in the Adriatic.(b) H.M,. Ships and aircraft to be authorised to carry out occasionalattacks without warning on enemy ships engaged in the traffic between Spain and Italian ports in the Gulf of Genoa, outsidethe declared danger zone of. 30 miles from Italian territory.There is an increasing trade in enemy and Spanish shipsbetween Spain and Italian ports in the Gulf of Genoa, and the sinking of one or two vessels engaged in it might greatlyrestrict the flow of contraband.     At the present time itwould be inadvisable to sink any of the Spanish shipstalcing part,/It......
It is not normally possible, under the conditions which governoperations in this area, for H.M. Ships to operate within 30miles of the Italian Coast.(c)   H.1.U Ships and aircraft to be authorised to attack at sight anyship in the Central Mediterranean. &apos;-,The Italians have recently declared a very large danger area inthe Central Mediterranean,&apos; extending from Sardinia, to Sicily,from the entrance to the Adriatic to Crete, and&apos;thence to the coasts of Egypt, Libya, Tunis and part of Algeria.     In orderto strengthen our grip on Italian ooriaiuiicatioins to Libya, Ipropose to declare a. similar but smaller area between Italy,Sardinia and Libya.     Within this area our aircraft and warships. would be allowed to sink, without earning, merchant ships ofany nationality.     This zone would also be of great value if theItalians or the Germans attempted a sea-borne invasion of. Tunisia,     In the unlikely event of our approving any neutralvoyages through the Mediterranean, our patrols, would be warnedto respect the vessels in question.3. I attach (annexe l) a draft of the notification to Neutrals proposedtuider (p.) above, and (annexe Ii) a draft of instructions which will be issued to Naval authorities in the Mediterranean if the present proposals are approved.A.V.A.ADMIRALTY, S.W.1 .February 18, 1 92f1 .

The notification issued in July, 1940, to the effect that-all ships navigating within 30 miles of any Italian territory inthe Mediterranean will do so at their risk and peril is unafftcted by this declaration and remains in force.

C oramander-in-Chie f, Medi to rran eah.Flag Officer Commanding, North Atlantic.Vice Admiral, Malta.S.O. Force (ll).Repeated:     Air Ministry.FROM: Admiralty. -A navigational warning has been issued declaring dangerous to shipping an area in the Mediterranean enclosed by the lines joining thefollowing positions:-Prom Cape Sta. Maria di Leuca in Italy Lat. 3902j.8&apos; N. long.18022&apos;S.  (approx.) in a &apos;i620 direction to Benghazi thence westward along the north African shore to the Tunisian - Tripoli frontier thence along the limits of French territorial waters to a. position 3 miles northward of cape Bon in Lat. 37o08f II. long. 11o0V E.  (approx.) thence in a 304Odirection to a position 30 miles 1800 from Cape Spartivento in Sardiniathence at a distance of 30 miles from the west coast of Sardinia to the parallel 41018&apos; No thence eastward along this parallel to Paola Fuara pointthence southward and eastward along the coast of Italy to Cape Sta. Mariadi Leuca,,2. V/ithin this area surface vessels, submarines and aircraft mayattack any vessels at sight but French coastal traffic including traffic toislands off the Tunisian coast should not be interfered with.3o In the Adriatic all vessels navigating within 30 miles of italian and Italian occupied territory may be attacked without warning; to avoidinfringing Yugo-Slav territorial waters, northern limit of 30 mile zone offcoast of Albania is to be latitude 420 north.     Certain Yugo-Slav shipsmay occasionally be allowed to enter and leave Adriatic on approved voyages.In these cases C. in C. Mediterranean will be informed by consul grantingnavicert and should instruct patrols accordingly.     Assume local naval authorities will inform C. in C. Mediterranean if Yugo-Slav ship is permitted to sail from Egyptian or Palestine port to Adriatic.A........
2j.. Elsewhere in the Mediterranean German and Italian vessels mayhe attacked without warning anywhere within 30 miles of Italian territory and also south of lat. 350 46&apos; N. in Tunisian territorial waters inaccordance with rny 0202/5.5. The necessity of discouraging trade between Spanish and Italianports was referred to in my 1229/15/&quot;! *     In view of the difficulty ofmaintaining patrols within 30 miles of the Italian coast particularly offGenoa, and in order to discourage trade between Spain and Italy there isno objection to occasional attacks without warning being carried out against enemy merchant ships outside 30 miles of Italian territory.
