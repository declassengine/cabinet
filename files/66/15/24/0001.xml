Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1941.SECEET. Copy No.March 3, 1941.//-/TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY/&quot; /It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document;WAR CABINET.THE FORMATION OF A FREE ITALIAN MOVEMENT INTHE ITALIAN COLONIES.Report of a Committee set up in accordance ivith D.O. (41), 8th Meeting,Conclusion 1 (b), to consider terms of reference and a personal minute by thePrime Minister which are reproduced in Annex A. (The composition of theCommittee is at Annexe C.)THE Prime Ministers proposals have been considered under threeheadings:  (a) Should we run Cyrenaica as a Free Italian Colony?(b) Should we enlist a Free Italian Force and station it in Cyrenaica?(c) Are we in a position to make Cyrenaica comfortable, prosperous, andhappy?2. If the scheme taken as a whole were feasible it would be of considerableuse and importance from the naval and propaganda points of view.3. Navy. One of our main objects in the event of an Italian collapse is toprevent the Italian fleet from falling into the hands of the Germans. If therewere at any future time any question of a voluntary surrender of the whole or part of the Italian fleet, the existence of a Free Italian Cyrenaica would be an advantage, since Italians might find it easier to take their ships to what was stillan Italian colony rather than to an enemy port like Alexandria. The fact that insuch an event it might be possible for the families of the crews to live amongtheir fellow-countrymen would certainly be an inducement. Again, if the italian fleet were to cross to Cyrenaica, the Free Italian Colony might obtain an ItalianAdmiral as a leader. Unfortunately, the largest vessels of the Italian fleet couldnot be accommodated in Cyrenaican ports.4. Propaganda. From the Propaganda point of view the idea of aprosperous Free Italian Colony is very attractive, since, inter alia, the fact of its existence would enable us to encourage Italians to hope that the future of theircountry is not necessarily tied up with Germany and Fascism. The element ofhope is at present lacking in our propaganda, which inevitably is concentratedfor the most part on exploiting the average Italian&apos;s fear and hatred of theGermans. This is. excellent as far as it goes, but we would like something more positive.5.   As regards headings 1 (a) and (b), i.e., shoidd we run Cyrenaica as a FreeItalian ^ Colony, and should we enlist a Free Italian Force and station it atCyrenaicm?   The Committee had not sufficient information to be able to form an opinion as to whether there was sufficient material in the local Italian population[22255] BDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
or among the Italian prisoners of war to make it possible to start either a FreeItalian movement at Cyrenaica or to embody a Free Italian Force which could be stationed in the territory. For some time past efforts have been made to findleaders in this country or elsewhere who could organise and head a Free Italianmovement. So far no one has emerged of sufficient calibre to undertake such atask in Cyrenaica.6. It was agreed that General Wavell, in consultation with the Naval andAir Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, must be asked to investigate these two questions and to furnish His Majesty&apos;s Government with their views. Thequestioning of Italian prisoners now proceeding should, for this purpose, bedirected towards finding out how many would be ready to enlist in a Free ItalianForce.7. Sir Miles Lampson should also be asked whether the large Italian colonyin Alexandria would supply any material, either military or civil.8. Great care would have to be taken to prevent the infiltration ofundesirable elements among those joining either the Free Italian movement or theFree Italian Military force.9. If the setting up of a Free Italian Colony and military force were to involve an increase in the civilian or military population, this would add to theadministrative difficulties which will, in any case, have to be met in supplying thepopulation of Cyrenaica. The Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, ought to beinvited to give their views on this matter, but it is to be hoped that the scheme,if otherwise feasible, would not be held up on account of such administrative difficulties.10. From the political angle, the following are the two main difficultieswhich will have to be circumvented : 11. The scheme might be interpreted as a commitment by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to hand Cyrenaica back to a non-Fascist Italy after the war.Although in certain circumstances we might be prepared to hand back Cyrenaicato Italy, we do not wish at this stage to tie our hands. Italian misrule in cyrenaica, the cruel methods employed in pacifying the province, &amp;c., all makeit very difficult to justify a decision to hand the colony back, and such a decisions would, in fact, be regarded as a betrayal by the Arab population, whose anti-Italian feeling is certainly extremely strong.12. By setting up a Free Italian Colony in Cyrenaica we might find ourselves in the position of having to mediate between local Italians and localArabs, and a situation might thus easily develop analogous to the one which wehave had to face in Palestine. In any case. Arab feeling throughout the middle east would be hostile to the scheme. There are already indications that, in orderto liberate the Arabs in Cyrenaica from Italian rule, it is hoped that the territorywill be handed over to Egypt, or even to Turkey.13. It might be possible to get round these political difficulties by setting upa Free Italian Colony not in Cyrenaica at all but in Eritrea, where relationsbetween Italians and natives have not been so strained as in Cyrenaica and wherethe latter, in any case, are not as race-conscious as are the Arabs.14. Three other reasons in favour of setting up a Free Italian Colony inEritrea rather than in Cyrenaica are : (a) It might be of advantage that, if andwhen the Italian Fleet leaves Italy, it should move out of the Mediterraneanaltogether, as would be the case if it came to Eritrea, (b) Cyrenaica may for sometime to come be within the range of German bombers, and this fact mightdemoralise any Free Italian movement. There would be no such danger ofGerman bombers in Eritrea, (c) Although just as in Cyrenaica there are no ports in Eritrea capable of accommodating the largest vessels of the Italian Beet, thereis a natural anchorage at Annesley Bay, 10 miles S.E. of Massawa, capable of taking the whole fleet (It is understood, however, that there are no shorefacilities.)15. As regards the third question to be considered, i.e., the possibility ofmaking Cyrenaica comfortable, prosperous and happy, the position is that thecolony is not self-supporting and has always drawn a very large proportion of
its supplies from external sources and mainly from metropolitan Italy. this fact, in view of the present difficult supply position in the Mediterranean, willmake it far from easy to make Cyrenaica prosperous and happy. However,Treasury have endorsed General wavell&apos;s view of the importance of restartingimport trade as soon as possible, and have declared their willingness to considerthe grant of sterling credits. In any case considerable expenditure by HisMajesty&apos;s Government may be required. Further, the currency position in cyrenaica raises difficult problems which cannot well be solved in the absenceof further information. Meanwhile, steps are being taken to prevent speculation,and the importance of stabilising the position and preventing distress and hard-ship among the civilian population is being constantly borne in mind. the considerable expenditure now being made by our troops should be having a beneficial effect.16.   To sum up.   The conclusions of the Committee are : (a) The scheme, if and when feasible, might be very valuable from the pointof view of the Italian Fleet and certainly would be so from the pointof view of our own Italian propaganda (paragraphs 2-4).(b) Since there are difficulties in the way of the proposals (paragraphs 5-12),it is felt that it is necessary to obtain further information on thesebefore reaching definite conclusions. A telegram should therefore beaddressed to the three Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, and toHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo in order to obtain this informa-tion and to elucidate their views on various points. A draft telegramis attached (Annex B).(c) In the event of the Commanders-in-Chief reporting favourably on thepoints remitted to them, the following questions will fall to be con-si dered by His Majesty&apos;s Government: (i) Whether  we  mind   committing  ourselves   tacitly   to   returnCyrenaica to a non-Fascist Italy after the war (paragraph 11).(ii) How to avoid being involved in a new Arab controversy (para-graph 12).(iii) Whether, in view of (ii) and of other considerations, the FreeItalian movement might not be established in Eritrea ratherthan in Cyrenaica (paragraph 14).Foreign Of/ice, February 21, 1941.ANNEX A.Prime Minister&apos;s Personal Minute.Serial No. D. 36/1.General Ismay, for C.O.S. Committee.I SEE no reason why you should not consider raising an anti-Mussolini orFree Italian force in Cyrenaica. Volunteers might be called for from the100,000 prisoners we have taken. There must be a great many who hateFascism. We might even rule Cyrenaica under the Free Italian flag and treat itin the same way as de Gaulle&apos;s colonies are being treated subject to our military control. Anyhow, I wish Cyrenaica to be petted and made extremely comfortableard prosperous, more money being spent upon them than they are intrinsicallyworth, jan we not make this place a base for starting a real split in Italy andthe source of anti-Mussolini propaganda? We might make it a model of british rule, hold it in trust for the Italian people and have 4,000 or 5,000 italian troops sworn to the liberation of Italy from the German and Mussolini yoke.This could be run as world propaganda. The matter raises wide political con-siderations and I am sending a copy of this minute to the Foreign Secretary.(Intld.) W. S. C.February 11, 1941.[22255]
Terms of Reference.(D.O. (41) 8th Meeting, February 11, item 1 (&amp;).)Agreed that the Foreign Office should forthwith set up a committee consisting of a Chairman to be nominated by the Foreign Office, and repre-sentatives of the three Service Departments, the Ministry of Economic warfare and the Treasury, to examine and report on the question of whether to attemptthe formation of a Free Italian Movement in the Italian Colonies on the lines ofthe Free French Movement.ANNEX B.Draft Telegram to Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, and to His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Cairo.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration the creation of(a) a Free Italian Colony in Cyrenaica; this colony to be run under the FreeItalian flag and treated, ceteris paribus, as are Free French colonies; and (b) the raising of a Free Italian force from among Italian prisoners to be stationed in cyrenaica.. 2. Main advantage of this scheme would be that, from point of view of propaganda, the existence of a Free Italian colony would enable us to encourageItalians to hope that the future of their country is not necessarily tied up withGermany and Fascism. Secondly, it might, if and when the time comes, facilitate the voluntary surrender of whole or part of Italian fleet, since Italians might find it easier to take their ships to what was still an Italian colony than to anenemy port. Italian fleet might in that case provide an Admiral as leader of themovement. I realise, however, that largest units of Italian fleet could not be accomodated in Cyrenaican ports.3. Meanwhile, I should be grateful for your views on the following specific points :  (a) Do you consider that a Free Italy movement could be created in cyrenaica among the existing civil population ?[To Cairo only.] Could the large Italian colony in Egypt supplyany useful recruits, including potential leaders?[To all.]   No leaders are available in this country.(b) What are the chances of raising a Free Italian force amongst italian prisoners of war ? What numbers could safely be recruited ? Couldquestioning of Italian prisoners be directed to this end?military(c) What are your views on the above from the purely naval     points ofairview and from the standpoint of administration, supply andparticularly security ? In any event His Majesty&apos;s Government attach importance to both Italian and Arab population of Cyrenaica beingmade as comfortable and prosperous as possible under war conditions.(d) What would be the reactions to these proposals among the Arabs of cyrenaica, in Egypt, and in the Arab world in the Middle Eastgenerally ?4. I shall be grateful for any further observations you may wish to offerin general. In particular, would you see any advantages in setting up a FreeItalian movement in Eritrea, rather than Cyrenaica, on the grounds, for instance,that there is no Arab problem in Eritrea, and Italian fleet if it surrenderedwould be better placed in the Red Sea than in the Mediterranean, and thatEritrea, unlike Cyrenaica, is beyond reach of German bombers?
