THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for khe War Cabinet.  April 1941.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (41) 76.April 3, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK  AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE SITUATION IN FRANCE.Circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.Mr. KENNETH DOWNS, the correspondent of the International NewsService referred to in Lisbon telegram No. 266a of the 19th March, called to seems on the 1st April. He amplified Sir R. Campbell&apos;s report in certain particulars.He has recently been in Paris and Vichy, having crossed into the occupied zonethrough subterranean methods of his own. He knows the American Embassiesin Paris and Vichy very well, and his views are largely a reflexion of what theytold him.Mr. Downs agreed that Marshal Petain is the only one at Vichy in whom we can place any trust. He is, however, an old man and many things are done under his nose about which he knows nothing.Admiral Darlan is very dangerous and his lust for power is such as to amount to madness. He told Admiral Leahy that the British fleet was no good and that he would blow it up himself. He walked round Vichy throwing hischest out and making remarks of this kind. They got to the ears of the fleet,who were very worried, and Admiral Darlan had to send a message to allay theiranxiety that he would ask them to fight against England. Darlan had not muchto do with the fleet now as politics absorbed all his attention. He is definitelyLavaFs man. Mr. Downs was told by the Assistant Naval Attache to the UnitedStates Embassy that the French fleet would refuse to obey an order to come out against us, and that some of the Admirals would mutiny, too. He feels, however,that Darlan will try to bring about a clash through the convoy system. There isnot much bitterness in the fleet over Mers-el-Kebir.Admiral Darlan tells lies to Admiral Leahy the whole time. Whenever the ambassador finds him out he goes round to Petain, who has reprimanded Darlanmore than once. Admiral Leahy likes Marshal Petain, but is fed up with thewhole Vichy show.General Huntziger will do anything which the Germans tell him to do.Laval told Mr. Maynard Barnes, the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires inParis, that he saw in 1935 that the choice for the future lay between Fascismand Bolshevism, and he had elected for Fascism, He said that he was againstanything in the nature of a compromise peace, and that England must be liquidated. He knew that otherwise his life would not be worth a nickel. he knew, too, that he had not got one per cent, of public opinion behind him, buthe did not care as long as the German army was there. To this Mr. Barnesretorted that he supposed that Laval was going to use the German army as Hitler11335   [22393]
Foreign Office, April 3, 1941.had used the Brownshirts. Laval replied : &quot;If you like to put it that way, you can.&quot; Laval will never make the same mistake again as he made last Decemberwhen Petain sacked him. He is in a very blustering mood, and the power whichhe enjoyed last autumn has gone to his head. Mr. Downs thinks that when Lavalcomes back he may keep on Darlan, making him Chief of State but keep all thepower as President of the Council in his own hands.M. Georges Bonnet is trying to get himself appointed Ambassador to washington. When he goes to Vichy, however, he hides away in corners andno one will be seen talking to him.German control in occupied France is thorough. There is a Kommandanturin every village. They have drained the country dry and are still removingfoodstuffs from unoccupied France. The trains usually move by night.Mr. Downs took a rowing boat out in the harbour of Marseilles and saw what he believed were two Spanish ships painted over, manned by Germans, and unloading citrus fruits. He tried to get exact figures of cargoes seized by theGermans at Marseilles, but failed. He did learn, however, that a shipment of5,000 tons of rubber had arrived a month earlier and had been distributed to theFrench factories which were working for Germany. It could be said that all french industries were now working on German orders. They had the optioneither of doing so or of closing down. Goodrych and Matford, though their capital was American, were French companies and were working for Germany.These two factories are near Paris, but the Michelin factory at Clermont Ferrandin unoccupied France is doing the same.Mr. Downs gave the same depressing picture of the feeling in France as sir Ft. Campbell reported in his telegram No. 266a. He found no will to resistanywhere. He had not time to go to Brittany, but he understood that the Bretonswere the only people who were doing anything. Since his previous visit last autumn there had been one noticeable change in opinion in that many more peoplenow-believed in our victory. Anti-German feeling was strong, but the hate wasimpersonal and far removed from passion. The German soldiers had behavedpretty well. There had been some sabotage, but only on a small scale. A fewrailway workers had been shot, but on the whole the Germans had adopted nosevere repressive measures. Mr. Downs found a few tough people, but very few.Curiously enough, he said that the Cagoulards were the toughest so far as hecould find out. He could get no line on the Communists, and there seemed tobe no movement among the working classes. Mr. Barnes thinks there is a strongpossibility that France will be brought by the Germans back into the war againagainst us. The German control is so complete and the French will to resistso slight, that the Germans can do anything with them. The German armycontrols the country and Germany has in her hand the card of the two millionFrench prisoners of war in Germany which she can play as and when she wants.One satisfactory feature was that German propaganda had had no effectwhatsoever on the French. Fie heard nothing about our pamphlets, and he couldonly suppose that there were not enough of them. He found that the French knewvery little about what America was doing.Despite this gloomy picture of France, Mr. Downs would send some food,though without any illusion that it would have any effect in the direction of encouraging the French people to resist, provided we were in return able to plantobservers all over the place.Mr. Downs is quite confident that Laval will be assassinated, and he thinksit quite possible that Darlan will be assassinated, too, by one of the fewFrenchmen who still remain tough.In accordance with the Prime Minister&apos;s instructions, I am making arrangements for Mr. Dupuy to see Mr. Downs.W. H B. MACK.
