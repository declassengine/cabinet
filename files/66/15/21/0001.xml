OUTWARD TELEGRAMis Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government, and should bekept under Lock and Key.]W. 1880/49/49.DISTRIBUTION B.To; UNITED STATES OF AMERICACypher telegram to Viscount Halifax (Washington)Foreign Office..     3rd March, 1941.     1.20c a,in.No. 1170,b b b b b bIMMEDIATE.Your telegram No.800 [of 20th February:   Supplies for &apos;unoccupied France and Morocco].We must rely on you to reason patiently &quot;with the UnitedStates Government against giving any food to unoccupied France.You are familiar with our case but it may be useful to you topoint to the following unsatisfactory features of the Vichyscene.2.   We have placed our hopes to a large extent in Retain&apos;sstubbornness and sense of honour, believing that he will holdto his undertaking, not to surrender the French fleet or basesto our enemiesc     His effective control of the Vichy.Governmenthas hoirever been much shaken by recent events.     He has had to dismiss the Ministers who supported him against Laval, and to surrender some of his functions as President of the Council tothe Vice-President of the Council.3o   Effective control at Vichy will therefore be mainly in the hands of the Anglophobe and ambitious Darlan and of theMinister of Finance who is an ardent support of Franco-Germancollaboration. ,-4.   Present indications are that economic collaboration with Germany is under active discussion-     We know fromsecret sources that Vichy does not wish to have at present any economic discussions with us,  - One of the first results ofDarlan&apos;s accession &quot;to power is the appointment of a Delegate-General to conduct the negotiations relating to.Franco-Germancollaboration and it is.announced that the new Government bycentralising these negotiations shows its desire to collaborate with Germany.5.   The Vichy Government has shorn no desire to establisheffective contacts with us.     They have refused to accept a treasury representative at Vichy, pleading that this was contrary to the armistice.     They thought fit to inform theArmistice Commission in December that they would have to engage In economic discussions with us.     They apparently *consult the Armistice Commission on every detail concerningtheir foreign relations and can it appears carry on no discussion with.us without the explicit approval of thatCommission..-
6. The Germans have already gone far beyond the termsof the armistice in many ways, and so far as we know the onlyprotest raised by Vichy was v/ith regard to Alsace and Lorraine.While it is to our advantage that Petain should cling to the *terms of the armistice so far as the disposal of the fleet Jand bases is concerned, it is to our disadvantage that heinterprets the armistice as meaning that he -is to have norelations with this country. His present policy of subservienceto Germany and the tolerance of German commissions atimportant bases in France and North Africa bids fair tonullify his undertaking that in no circumstances will basesbe surrendered to the enemy, (see my telegram No.925 [of Februai19th].). Neither the Vichy G6VfeTilillem&quot;llijT^n^y^gems in north Africa show any spark of nobility or courage or any active will to resist. They may hope for our victory but will do nothing to help, since if we lose they may thus, they trust, have acquired merit in German eyes, while if we winthey assume we shall in any event restore France. Meanwhile,they expect us to allow them to be amply supplied from overseas.7.   The reasons why the supply of foodstuffs tounoccupied France would damage our blockade are explained inthe following paragraphs.8.   Factories in unoccupied France are working more andmore for the Germans, and we naturally become less and lessinclined to help feed the workers who make the bombs that fallin our cities.        Any supplies sent from overseas help to relieve Germany of the burden of feeding those thus employed..9.   Wheat is not a German deficiency.     Europe in mormal times is almost self-sufficient in breadstuffs on the basis of full unrationed consumption.       The problem of feeding GermanEurope is one of transport more than of supply.     The enemyis deprived of sea cormnunications and has placed a first and heavy call on land transport for the carriage of his armies ofoccupation and invasion, and for their supplies.     He hasremoved large quantities of rolling stock from the occupied territories and allows no petrol for civilian transport.     Butthe point will be reached where he will have to release transport!to distribute food to the areas where there is a localshortage, if he is to prevent an enconomic breakdown.     any supplies from overseas shipped to these areas thus directlyrelieve the strain on the German war machine.10.     We doubt how far shipment of wheat to Marseilleswould in fact solve the problem of feeding unoccupied France.It would almost certainly be followed by requests to allow the import of lorries, tyres, and petrol.to distribute it tothe places v/here it was needed.     It would, of course, be outof the question to grant any such requests.
11.    The Germans are probably anxious to build upreserves of wheat in Germany against the possibility of shortage later;     e.g., in the event of war in the Balkans.They have been preventing the export of wheat to unoccupied france from the occupied zone, which normally has a surplusand this has no doubt gone to swell the German stocks,12.     It has been represented to us that if Vichy hadto ask the Germans to send wheat the latter would claim aquid pro quo, whereas Marshal Petain would be in a stronger position to resist Gorman demands if he could say he had made arrangements for wheat supplies from outside.     this argument is [specious since Vichy would in any case have toask the Germans for permission for the admission of wheat from outside, and the Germans would probably insist on somequid pro quo   in return.     In either case Vichy is in theHands of the Germans,Repeated to Madrid No,- 78, Lisbon No. 115 and TangierNo.8 Saving.
