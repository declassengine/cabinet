(41) 69-March 26, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.1. WE should assume ah import of not less than 31 million tons in 1941. Onthis basis, food cannot be cut lower than 15 million tons, and a million isrequired for the Board of Trade. This leaves 15 millions for the Ministry ofSupply, as against 19 millions to which they were working on the 35 millionprogramme. A cut of 4 millions has, therefore, to be made by the Ministry ofSupply, for which a revised programme should be framed. Ferrous materials,timber and pulp seem to offer the main field of reduction. As we can now buysteel freely in the United States, the keeping in being of the whole of the existingsteel industry cannot be accepted as an indispensable factor. We must try to import in the most concentrated forms and over the shortest routes. this principle must also influence food imports.2. Should our total imports fall below 31 millions, the deficit should forthe present be met by the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Supply on thebasis of one ton cut in food to two tons in supply. Should the imports exceed31 millions, the benefit will be shared in the same proportion. The position willbe reviewed in the autumn, when this year&apos;s harvest is known.3. I have received from the War Office a reply to my Notes* about ArmyScales, which they have had under consideration for three weeks.  My notes did not* See Annex I, printed below.[22354] b
look further ahead than 1942, and must be subject to review in the light of events.My figure of &quot; about 2 millions &quot; may be interpreted as desired by the War office at &quot; 2,19-5,000,&quot; for which the arrangements are completed. The War Officeproposal to substitute for my figure of 15 Armoured Divisions, 12 armoured divisions and 9 Army Tank Brigades, may be approved, and the target figure for the grand total of the Imperial Army in March 1942 of 59^ &quot; equivalentDivisions.&quot; may be accepted. The resultant saving on man-power intake from now to the end of 1942 is about 475,000. This saving, and the increase inarmoured forces at the expense of infantry and artillery, should afford animportant relief to the Ministry of Supply in hutments, clothing and projectiles.4. The Purvis Programme, which was submitted to President Roosevelt inJanuary to give him the general scale, may now be more precisely defined as theMinistry of Supply desire, and in so doing, if convenient, the adjustment may he made to cover the change in the proportion of Armoured Forces. However, it isimportant that no diminution should be made in anything we need and are likelyto get from the United States; in particular, the equipment for the 10 extraDivisions should stand.5. The Naval Programme is the subject of a separate note,* but thefollowing principles which have a bearing on imports may be stated here : The remaining three King George V Class battleships must be completed at full speed. The construction of Vanguard, which is the only capital ship whichcan reach us in 1943 and before 1945, is most desirable. One new Monitor is alsoneeded. No other heavy ships can be proceeded with at present, and no morearmour-plate can be provided for other naval purposes for the next six months;nor should new armour-plate factories be laid down. This position will be reviewed on the 1st September in the light of (a) The Battle of the Atlantic.(b) The relationship of the United States to the war.The requirements of the Admiralty for armour-plate must not exceed the16,500 tons provided for 1941, nor the 25,000 tons for 1942. If these limits areobserved, the Ministry of Supply should be able to execute the increased TankProgramme.6. The Ministries of Food and Agriculture should, upon the basis of15 million tons import in 1941, concert an 18 months&apos; programme, drawing asmay be necessary upon our meat reserves on the hoof to cover the next sixmonths, but endeavouring to provide by concentrated imports the most varieddietary possible for the nation at Avar. By taking a period as long as 18 months,it should be possible to avoid hurried changes in policy, to use reserves asbalancing factors, and to make the best use of the assigned tonnage.7. The British Air power will continue to be developed to the utmost withinthe above limits and with the present priorities and assignments.w. s. c.March 26, 1941.* See Annex II, printed below.
ANNEX I.ARMY   SCALES.Directive by the Minister of Defence.WHEN in September 1939 the Cabinet approved the formation of a field army of 55 Divisions, it was not realised that a Division as contemplated by theWar Office with its share of Corps, Army, G-.H.Q. and L. of C. formationswould require 42,000 men, exclusive of all training establishments and of allgarrisons, depots or troops not included in the Field Army. At that time also it was assumed that the bulk of our Army would stand in the line with theFrench under conditions comparable to those of the last War, whereas the bulkof our Army now has to stay at home and defend the Island against invasion.Thirdly, the shipping stringency makes it impossible to transport and maintainvery large forces overseas, especially on the high scales which the War Officeregard as necessary.2. Out of the 55 Divisions (now become 57), 38 are British and 21 Overseastroops. Of the 36 British Divisions, one (so-called) Division is in Iceland, andone (the 6th) is forming in Egypt, together with 2 Armoured Divisions there,total British Divisions now overseas = 4.3. Twenty-five British Infantry Divisions and the equivalent of 7Armoured Divisions in process of formation, total 32, are now included in theHome Forces Army. At 19,500 men apiece, these 25 British Infantry Divisionsaggregate 487,500 men, and the 7 Armoured Divisions at 14,000 apiece aggregate98.000, total 575,500. In addition to the Divisional organization, C.-in-C,Home Forces, has 10 independent Brigades, including the Guards Brigades.27 Beach Brigades, and 14 unbrigaded Battalions, all British. At an average of3,500 men apiece, these 42 Brigades or equivalents account for about 150,000 men.Therefore the total number of British in tactical formations at home amounts to735,500 men.4. There are on our ration strength at home 1,800,000 British soldiers.735,500 are accounted for in the above formations, leaving 1.064,500 to be explained as Corps, Army and G.H.Q. troops and A.D.G.B. or as training establishments, depots, &amp;c, and as part of the rearward services of the forces overseas.5. It is upon this pool of 1,064,500 that the Army must live. By wiseeconomies, by thrifty and ingenious use of man power, by altering establishmentsto fit resources, it should be possible to make a very great improvement in thefighting strength. Apart from this capital fund of man-power, the Army can count each year upon its 18&apos;s and 19&apos;s. It is only in the event of heavy casualtiesbeing sustained through many Divisions being simultaneously and continuously[22354] b 2
in action, which except in the case of invasion is extremely unlikely, that anyfurther inroad can be allowed upon the man-power resources of Great Britain.,In other words the Army can rely on being kept up to something like their present&apos;figure of about 2 million British, and they will be judged by the effective fightinguse they make of it.6. At the same time, it will be well to plan an eventual increase of Armouredformations to the equivalent of 14 Armoured Divisions (or 15 if the AustralianArmoured Division materialises), in which would be included the Army Tank-Brigades. A reduction of several Infantry Divisions would be required, and theBritish Army would then be composed of 14 Armoured Divisions (or their equivalent) and about 22 Infantry Divisions. The War Office and Ministry ofSupply should work out proposals on these lines.7. The 3 East African Divisions and the West African Division should notbe organised in formations higher than Brigades or small mobile groups adapted to the duties they have to perform.8. It will be impossible for us to maintain from Great Britain any largeaddition to our Army in the Middle East, because we have to go round the Cape.The main accretion of this Army must come from India, Australasia and SouthAfrica, with later on munitions from the United States. Three or four moreBritish Divisions is the most we can hope to send and keep there. One must consider that General Weygand&apos;s silence has released us from any offer of helpinghim up to six Divisions, although, of course, we might act on our own volition.An amphibious striking force of eight or ten Divisions, mostly armoured, is theutmost that need be envisaged in the West. There can be no question of an advance in force against the German Armies on the mainland of Europe.9. The above considerations and the situation as a whole make it impossiblefor the Army, except in resisting invasion, to play a primary role in the defeat of the enemy. That task can only be done by the staying power of the Navy, and above all by the effect of Air predominance. Very valuable and important services may be rendered Overseas by the Army in operations of a secondary order, andit is for these special operations that its organisation and character should be adapted.10. The reactions of the foregoing directive on manpower accommodation,ammunition, stores, &amp;c, should be worked out.w. s. c.March 6, 1941.
ANNEX II.NAVAL PROGRAMME 1941.Directive by the Minister of Defence.NAVAL programmes have been continuous throughout the war, all slipsbeing filled as vacated. It is, nevertheless, convenient at this time of year that theAdmiralty should present tbeir present needs of new construction in a generallist and obtain Cabinet sanction for their policy.2. No one can doubt that the construction of small craft for anti-U-boatwarfare, for minesweeping, for combating the E-boats, and for assault landingsshould proceed to the full extent of our resources. It is essential, however, thatsimplicity of design, speed of construction and the largest possible numbers shouldo-overn the whole of this small craft programme. The construction of destroyersshould in no case exceed 15 months. I understand from the Controller that apartfrom enemy action or strikes he can guarantee this in respect of the 40 nowprojected.3. We cannot at the present time contemplate any construction of heavyships that cannot be completed in 1942. This rules out further progress uponthe Lion and Temeraire and the laying-down of Conqueror and Thunderer. it also makes it impossible to begin the four heavy cruisers contemplated in theprogramme of 1940. Work will, therefore, be limited to completing the threeremaining battleships of the King George V class and to building the three light cruisers of the 1941 programme, all of which &quot;it is understood can be completed before the end of 1942. An additional Monitor, for which the guns are already available, can also be completed before the end of 1942.4. The need of concentrating labour on merchant repairs and on repairs to the fighting fleet, makes it impossible to begin any new aircraft-carriers afterVictorious, Indomitable and Indefatigable have been completed. Such new aircraft-carriers could not in any case be ready until 1944.5. The requirements of the Navy in armour-plate can on the above basis be adjusted to meet the needs of the Army tank programme and can be limited to16,500 tons in 1941 and 25,000 tons in 1942. No new armour-plate plant need be erected at present.6. The one exception to the above principles is the Vanguard, which cancomplete in 1943 and is the only capital ship we can by any means obtain before1945. As we have the guns and turrets for the Vanguard, it is eminentlydesirable that this vessel should be pressed forward, provided that this can bedone within the limits of the armour-plate provision in paragraph 5.
7. Nothing in the above should hinder the work on the drawings and designsof any of the postponed vessels, including especially the new aircraft-carrier.8. In view of the need to concentrate on repairs, the output of new merchant ships may be reduced from 1,250,000 tons, which is the present target, to 1,100,000in 1942, and we should not at the present time proceed with any merchant vessels which cannot be completed by the end of 1941. It is to the United States buildingthat we must look for relief in 1942.9. The whole of our heavy ship construction will be reviewed on the1st September, 1941, in the light of (a) the Battle of the Atlantic, and(b) the relation of the United States to the War.W. S. C.March 27, 1941.
