I) gWAS CABINEToEVACUATION OP COASTAL AREAS.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.lo At their Meeting on the 6th February the WarCabinet invited me to carry out an immediate investigation into our Civil Defence arrangements in the event of invasion (W. M. (41) 14th Conclusions ,   Minute 6) sThe main problem calling for an early decision by the War Cabinet is that of the steps to be takento thin out the civil population from the coastal areas most likely to be selected by the enemy for aseaborne invasion -- i,e3 from the Wash to Littlehamptono2o I have discussed this problem with the Commander-in-chief, Home Forces,  and the Ministers primarily concerned.It is generally agreed that it would be inexpedient to rely!on a plan of compiilsory evacuation which wouldnot be put into operation until invasion was considered to be imminentcThe alternativelast summer,  i 0 e o: --&apos;is to apply the methods adopted(a)    To undertake at once, in the areasselected,  intensive local publicity- with the object of inducing peoplenot engaged in useful work to leavethe areas voluntarily in advance,(This publicity will be carried out &apos;by posters and other local methods;and steps will be taken to prevent any reference being made to&apos;these measures in the press or onthe wireless).      People so leavingwill proceed to destinations of theirown choosing:    but, where necessary,their railway fares will be paid/and billeting allowances provided.

These methods should result in asubstantial thinning out of the civilian population.      In most ofthe towns affected,  the aim will beto reduce the population to 40 percento  of the pre-war figure.      InIpswich and Colchester, however,a substantial proportion of thepopulation are engaged in industrial production,  and considerably lessthan 60 per cent, of the population will leave these towns.(b)    To hold in readiness schemes for the compulsory evacuation of the remainingpopulation,  (less workers needed toassist the military in keepingessential local services in operation -estimated at 3 per cent,  of the normalpopulation).      These schemes wouldbe put into operation,  if there weretime, when it became reasonablycertain that invasion would affectthat area.In addition, plans will be held in reserve for theremoval of such emergency refugees as decline to&quot;stay put&quot; if they find themselves loft behind in those areas, when they are actually threatened by invasion,cither as essential workers or because it has not beenpossible to put fully into effect the plans for the compulsory evacuation of the 40 per cent.3. Last year a scheme on these lines was firstapplied to the nineteen towns in East Anglia and Kentset out in Appendix Ac      The pre-war population of thosetowns was about 500,000 - 290,000 in East Anglia and210,000 in   Kent.      As a result of local publicity about60 per cent,  of this population were induced to leave.Since then there has been some tendency to return -increased by the decision,  in December, 1940, to raise noobjection to return to the East Anglian towns in cases of hardship - and the present population is estimatedat 150,000 (about 52 per cent.) in East Anglia and90,000 (about 43 per cent.) in Kent.The process of thinning out was subsequently extendedin the autumn to the further twelve towns listed inAppendix E*      The pre-war population of these townswas about 400,000.      Comparatively fey/ people wereinduced to leave Ipswich and Colchester, but in the coastal towns in Kent and Sussex a substantial reductionof population was effected.      Wo exact figures are available04. The Commander-ln-Chief would have been glad to seethe same evacuation scheme applied this spring, not onlyto these thirty-one towns, but to the whole of the coastal belt from the Wash to Littlehampton.The Ministers of the Civil Departments concernedfully recc gnise   the vital importance of reducing thepopulation in the areas most likely to be selected for a seaborne attack, so as to minimise the risk of

civilian refugees   impeding our military operations.They are anxious-to &quot;do&apos; everything practicable to minimise this risk;    but on practical grounds they thinkit would be inexpedient to attempt to apply thisscheme to the whole of the coastal area from theWash to Littlchampton.50 Firstr   it is considered that it would be impracticable to attempt to thin out the population in the rural part of this area.      The area includesseme of the most fertile agricultural land inEngland,  and represents about 10 per cent, of thetotal agricultural production of the country.      Inpresent circumstances we could not contemplate the lossof home production involved in withdrawing agricultural workers from &quot;this   area.We recommend that the thinning-out process shmildnot be applied to rural areas;    and further that thelocal publicity undertaken in the towns should make itclear that persons engaged in agriculture should not leave the area(6* Secondly, Ministers doubt whether it wouldbe practicable to induce 60 per cent,   of the population to leave the towns in the Brighton  group.      Hitherto.,no attempt lias been made to persuade residents toleave these towns,  and nothing has been done to discouragepeople from going into them from other areas - therehave been no restrictions on holidaymakers, such as havebeen imposed in other seaside towns.      Although thepopulation is down by about 20 per cent.,  as comparedwith the pre-war population, the numbers involved arevery large - the estimated total population of the fourtowns is about 250,000.      There would be very greatdifficulty in persuading 150,000 of these to leavevoluntarily, in response to local publicity;    and,even if it were possible to achieve this thinning-out,there would be very considerable difficulty in applying a plan for the compulsory evacuation of.theremaining 40 per cent-, when the emergency arose.      Indeed,this could only be done by bringing very largenumbers to the outskirts, or even the centre,  of london at a time when it must be expected that the capital would be subject to intensive air attack.The Commander-in-Chief thinks that,  if seaborneinvasion is attempted, there is a substantial risk that the enemy might deliver an attack between Newhavenand Littlehampton,      For this reason he urges that all practicable steps should be taken to reduce the civilpopulation in that    area.      But,  although he regardsthese towns as vulnerable, he agrees that in this area the risk of attack is less,  and the difficulty of thinning-out the civil population is far greater,  than in the coastaltowns further to the east,  in Sussex and in Kent.Before any attempt was made to thin out the adultresident population,  it would in any event be necessary(a)  to introduce restrictions prohibiting non-residentsfrom visiting these towns (except on business or for urgent domestic reasons),  and (b)  to arrange for the voluntary evacuation of the local schoolchildren.

If these measures were now applied to these towns, itis proboilc that the less settled elements among theadult population in Brighton and the    other townsv/ould take warning from this and would removethemselves from the area.A ban on the admission of visitors to thesetowns will undoubedly involve serious financial loss to the townspeoples  and will probably provokedemands for the provision of some relief from theExchequer.      The Liabilities (War-time Adjustment)Bill, which provides machinery   for enablingpersons who are in financial difficulties owingto circumstances arising from the war to arrive ata settlement with their creditors without having recourse to the bankruptcy procedure, will shortly be introduced in the House of Lords;    andcritics disposed to argue that measures of thiskind&apos;should be supplemented by some financial contribution by the Exchequer will find, if these restrictions are applied to the Brighton group of towns, many cases of hardship with which tosupport their argument.On balance, however, we think that some action should.be taken to reduce the population in this group of towns.      We therefore recommendthat,  as a first step,  a scheme should be launched for the voluntary evacuation of thelocal schoolchildren and restrictions onvisitors should be imposed.      As soon as it is known,what effect these measures have had in thinningout the adult population, we should review theposition again and consider whether it is practicable to apply frrther measures more directly designed to induce a substantial proportion of the civil population to leave these towns;.Re c recommend t i on s.7. I therefore,  submit, for consideration bythe War Cabinet,  the following recommendations:-(a) Intensive local publicity should atonce be undertaken,  on the linesadopted last year, with a viewto inducing persons not engagedin useful work to leave the towns set out in the   two-Appendices to this memorandum.(b) The Departments should prepare plans for carrying out,  if opportunity offers when invasion is imminent,the compulsory evacuation of thosestill remaining in those towns (less the workers needed to assist themilitary in maintaining essentiallocal services).-4-

(c) Departments should also prepare emergencyplans for the removal of refugees who ydecline- to &quot;stay put&quot; in these areas..(d) No attempt should be made to induceresidents to leave their homes in the rural parts of the coastal belt from theWash to. Littleharnpton,      No facilities(he,  railway fares or billetingallowances)  should be given to persons resident in those rural areas whodesire to leave their homes.(e) A scheme for the voluntary evacuation oflocal schoolchildren from towns in theBrighton group should at once be put intooperation;    and those t owns should bemade subject to the same restrictionsas regards visitors as alreadyapply to coastal towns from Great Yarmouthto Newhaven.Arrangements should be made to enable anestimate to be formed of the flow of residentsaway from this area and, when the evacuation of the local schoolchildren has beer-carried out,  further consideration shouldbe given to the practicability of talcingadditional measures to thin out the adultpopulation in these towns.(Intld.)
