(41)57.(Also Cn0.So(4l)ll2)copy NO.21STFEBRUARY,   1941*\WAR CABINET.yjrm-J^/^LlTX^J^I^HyiLL TO AIR ATTACK,.Bf  !ZJlJ2IlJ-hfi. Chiefs of Staff.It seems more than probable that a heavy air attackon Whitehall might he the prelude to an invasion.    We have therefore thought it right to review our arrangements for meeting an attack of this kind.2.. We see no reason to suggest any departure from thedecision taken last September that we should fight the battlefrom Whitehall,  until and unless we are either bombed out of it,or our communications break down.    We must therefore be preparedfor either eventuality.Alternative Accommodation.3. The position with regard to alternative accommodation isas follows:-(a) Citadels.Protected    accommodation with good communications and adequate furniture is ready for the ServiceOperational Staffs of the Admiralty and Air Ministry,and for the War Cabinet Offices with a nucleus ofHeadquarters, Home Forces.    The War Office, however,have not got a citadel.(b) A reserve of modern steel-frame buildings in and around the centre of London is being acquired;    but, owing -to the need for obtaining possession, partitioning andinstalling communications, these buildings will notbe available for some time.    These buildings are not-bomb-proof.      The present policy is that they shouldnot be allocated to Departments, until theoccasion arises.(c) Northwest London Suburbs Scheme.A number of schools from Hounslow to Hollowayhave been earmarked.    These buildings have no bomb-proof accommodation,  but possess A.R.P.   shelters.Telephones are provided and emergency furniture.These schools are at present occupied, but can bevacated at short notice,  if necessary.(This scheme would only be used if (b)  is impossible)*

VdJ Additional Citadels    e0g* Horse Guards,  Whitehall Gardens,Faraday House, Gurzon House,  etc.,  are in course ofpreparationo      These will &quot;be proof against heavy attack.Some are to &quot;be completed shortly;    some will not heready for a number of months-      It is suggested thatthey should he given maximum priority and allocated to departments so that special communications can heinstalled^, in particular those earmarked for the V/arOffice should he pressed on04. It would not he practicable for all Departments to carry outre a full dress rehearsal of their move from their present quarters,hut we think that all the citadels should he brought to a live stateof readiness as early as possible,,50 So far as the War Office is concerned, we recommend thatthey should forthwith he allocated alternative accommodation fromthe reserve of modern steel buildings in and around the centre ofLondon (see paragraph 3 (b) above)., in order that they may make their preparations .Cornmunlcations.6* Communications are the crux of the whole problem.      A &apos;breakdown of these would render it just as impossible for the headquarters of Government to control the war,  as would thedestruction of the present offices07. Telephone lines for Whitehall run in tube railways until theycorne to the surface at Charing Cross-0      It was for this reason thatit was decided to build the Whitehall Tunnel,  and it was hoped thattelephone communications would be installed therein by the end oflast year.     We regret to report, however, that ,owing to shortageof labour,  and other reasons,  the work has been considerably delayed.According to present estimates,  the Tunnel will not be completeduntil the end of March;    and full communications will not be installeduntil mid-Julyo     We think that every effort should be made toimprove on these timings, and that the construction of this Tunnelshould be given a very high degree of priority0     We also suggestthat the possibility should be studied of installing therein somerough-and-ready form of telephone communication as soon as theTunnel is built,  in order that the system may be in use with theleast possible delay.8. To sum up, we recommend -(i) That first priority should be given to thecompletion of the Whitehall Tunnel,(ii)  That the three citadels, Admiralty, Air ministry and War Cabinet should be brought to a livestate of readiness by 1st March,  1941.(iii) That one or more of the modern steel buildings that have been reserved for Government use in and around the centre of London should be allocatedforthwith to the War Office,  and prepared fortheir occupation a(iv) That, subject tp (i) above, the completion of theadditional citadels (see paragraph 3 (d) above)should be given high priority,  in particularthose required for the War Office.(v)  If necessary military labour should be emplyed to accelerate the work.(Signed)at George Street,  S.W.1, &quot;it21ST FEBRUARY,   1941.55 See ijrmex.-2-DUDL3Y POUNDCo  PORTALJ.
