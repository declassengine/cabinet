(41 )48. /       COPY NO._ol%S4TH FEBRUARY,  1941.AR CABINET.OIL DENIAL SCHEME - MIRI (SARAWAK) ANDSERIA (BRUNEI).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for theColonies.I think it is desirable for me to remind theMar Cabinet of the existence of the Oil Denial Scheme forMiri and Seria which was drawn up in October, 1939.Under this scheme measures will be taken in the event ofwar or imminent threat of war with Japan to deny to theenemy oil supplies from these two fields while retaining the fields as a potential source of supply to Great Britainand her allies.      Great Britain is placing no reliance on obtaining supplies of oil in time of war from british sources in Borneo.      The object of the scheme is to put the oilfields and refinery out of action while doing as littlepermanent damage as possible.2. The scheme falls into two parts,  a general denialscheme which can be completed in 46 hours and an emergencydenial scheme which requires only a few hours to put intoeffect and would be adopted if time did not permit thegeneral scheme to be put int-^ force or to be completed.3. There are three methods by which the general denialscheme may be authorised, namely:-(a) By the issue of the formal &quot;Warning telegram&quot;,initiating the &quot;Precautionary Stage&quot; against japan.      On receipt of this telegram the schemeis put into force automatically.(b) By the issue of special instructions fromthe Secretary of State for the Ccloniesbefore the issue of the warning telegramagainst Japan.(c) By order of the Governor and High Commissioner 1at Singapore, acting on his own responsibility in the event of an unexpected act of hostility by Japan in the Far East beforethe receipt of the warning telegram against japan.The emergency denial scheme is of course put into effect by the authorities on the spot in case of serious emergencywithout reference to London.

4o As the War Cabinet will be aware, colonial governments have recently been warned of the gravity of the situation in the Far East but the formal &quot;Warningtelegram11 initiating the precautionary stage against japan has not yet been sent.      In view of the presentthreatening situation it is for consideration whetherspecial instructions should be sent by me in accordancewith paragraph 3(b)05. It is laid down in the Government War Bookthat such special instructions can be sent only on theauthority of the war Cabinet and that it is the responsibilitycf the Secretary of State for the Colonies to raise thematter in Cabinet.      I do not consider that the time has yet come to put the general denial scheme into effectbut it will be appreciated that that time may come in thenear future and may come suddenly.        The object of thismemorandum is to remind the Cabinet of the position in case it should be necessary for me to seek.,their authority as a matter of urgency fcr putting the scheme into effect in the near future.6. Conclusion.,        The War Cabinet are asked to take note of this memorandum in order that they may be in aposition to give an Immediate decision when asked for one.Alternatively,  as the time fcr action may be very short,  itmay be considered better to authorise me&apos;to obtain a decision&quot; from the Prime Minister without waiting for a cabinet meeting.(Signed)    liOYNE.Colonial Office,24th February, 1941.-2&quot;
