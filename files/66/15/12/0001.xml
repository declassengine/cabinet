TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY, , - Jfit 88 requested that special care may be takon la __-Oftaure tho secrecy of this document(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT),SECRET.W.P.(Ul) 39 (Revise). . COPY NO.     2$L2kTH FEBRUARY,  19U1.WAR CABINET.POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND eastern mediterranean.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.Part I. &quot;We have considered very earnestly whether, from thomilitary point of view, it is the correct policy to endorse the offer made by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs to go to the immediate assistance of the Greeks with theforces which can be made available from the Middle East.It goes without saying that the expedition must be a gamble,but our representatives &quot;cm- the spot, after conference withthe Greeks, and full examination..of the. Greek plan-, evidentlythink that there is a reasonable prospect of successfullyholding up a German advancec      We feel that we must accept their opinion.2. On this assumption we have prepared the followingbalance sheet of what appear to us to be th: advantages and disadvantages of the enterprise.ADVANTAGES.3.      By going to Greece:-(a) We take the only remaining chance of forming a Balkan front, and of getting Turkey, andpossibly Yugoslavia, to enter the war on our side,(b) The formation of the Balkan front would havethe following advantages:-(i) It would make Germany fight at the endof a long line of communication, andexpend resources uneconomically.(ii) It would interfere with Germany&apos;s peacefultrade with the Balkans, and particularly with the traffic in oil from Roumania.(iii) It would enable us to establish a platformfor the bombing of Italy and theRoumanian oilfields.-1-

(iv) It would keep the war going in Albania,and prevent Italy devoting her energiesto re-establishing her position in North Africa.4. If we dc not assist the Greeks, the Germans willgain control of the Balkans, possibly.without firing ashot.        This would result in Germany:-(a) Acquiring naval and air bases from which to threaten our pcsition in the Eastern Mediterranean,including Crete and the Suez Canal, and tointerfere with our communications to Turkey.(b) Being free to concentrate on Turkey;    thuspaving the way for a further drive to thesouth and east.(c) Being able to run oil traffic from the Black Seato the Adriatic.DISADVANTAGES.5. (a)    We are undertaking a commitment of which we cannotforesee the extent..(b) If v/e commit all our available resources to Greecewe will have nothing left to offer the Turks who arealready complaining of a shortage of war material.(c) The despatch and subsequent maintenance of a forcein Greece would involve a considerable shipping commitmentAs a rough estimate we night have to forego as much as one million tons of imports a year.    (This figuremust of course be checked).(d) If war spreads to the Par East and it is decided towithdraw the main units of the Mediterranean Fleet,&quot;our forces in Greece would be stranded. -(e) Our forces in North Africa will have been depleted.The Germans and. Italians will be able *to build up forcesin Tripoli, and in due    course we may be faced witha considerable threat from that direction, particularlyin the air.      If the Greek affair went wrongs  and welost our equipment, we might be hard put to it toprovide enough for Egypt, apart from the time and shipping required to get it there.(f) Our strategic reserve in the Middle East willhave been thrown in at the outset of the battle.The Germans having got our forces into Greece may turnon Turkey first.(g) There is an acute shortage of ammunition andequipment for the Greek army.      If we have tp supply them to keep them in the fight, we shall have tomake further inroads on the equipment required for home Defence*

POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS,,C7&quot;----- - In the above balance sheet we have confined ourselves to the military aspects of the problem.    Politically itseems to us that there would be serious disadvantages ifwe were to fail to help Greece^    The effect on publicopinion throughout the world9 particularly in America.? ofour deserting a small nation which is already engaged in amagnificent fight against one aggressor and is willing todefy another, would be lamentable0CONCLUSIONS.7. Our considered opinion! is as follows:-   The possiblemilitary advrmiagos to be derived from going to the help cf Greece,are considerable, though their achievement is doubtful andthe risks of failure are serious,    The disadvantages of leavingGreece to her fate will be certain and far reaching.    Eventhe complete failure of an honourable attempt to help Greeceneed not be disastrous to our future ability to defeat Germany,.A weighty consideration in favour of going to Greece is to makethe Germans fight for what they want instead of obtaining it by default,,    On balance we think that the enterprise should go forv/ardo8B We wish to emphasise that if we are to undertake this commitment, every possible effort should be made to getthe Turks and the Yugoslavs to join in the struggle on our side.    Without the support of one or the other our help to greece is unlikely in the long run to have a favourableeffect on the war situation as a whole.    If both came in,however, the Germans would be seriously embarrassed, at leasttemporarily, and we should have a good chance of successfullybuilding up a Balkan front0Part II.0IMPLICATIONS.9. We also feel that the far reaching implications of ouractions, several of which we have already referred to, shouldbe carefully studied at once in order that we may make our arrangements to deal with them,,10.       The most important implications are as follows:-(a)    The extent of our effort in Greece.We would be definitely committed to sending three divisions, a Polish Brigade, and an armoured division, together with specialist units, e.g.anti-tank and AnA;    plus 14-16 squadrons of the&quot;R.A.F.:    and the Greeks have been told that what-we should do in future depended on the developmentof the general war situation and the state of our resources,,    It appears to us that the following are the most important limiting factors

1 i(i) We must not endanger our ability to resist invasion.(ii) The shipping commitment must not be. such as to jeopardise the import situation- We must not,in fact,  run the risk of strangulation at home.. (iii) We must not reduce our forces in Egypt beyond the safety line-(b) Shipping.,The move and subsequent maintenance of the forcealready promised must have a considerable effect onour programme of convoys to the Middle East, andon the shipping situation as a whole.      This shouldbe carefully studied with a view to finding out the limitations which must be imposed &quot;on our import programme,  and on the building up of our forces inthe Middle Eastu      Our power to carry out otheroperations may well be seriously affected.(c) The strategical position in the Middle East,-,Our forces in North Africa will for some time be weak.It will be necessary to consider the extent to whichwe should close down our operations against italian east Africa,  and concentrate northwards.      While wethink that operations should continue in Eritrea,at any rate until the rains break, we consider thatwe should obtain from our envoys their views on thegeneral strategy which should now be adopted in the african theatre.(^)    The Naval -uosi tion.There would be a considerable air menace to our linesof communication to Greece, and the reduction of the dodecanese becomes urgent.      It must be repeated that,if war spreads to the Far Hast,  the position of our forces in Greece will be precarious if we withdraw theimportant units of the Mediterranea.11 fleet to goeastward..   .
