IN view of the new developments in the Balkan situation it seems desirable to review briefly the question of our policy towards Turkey, withparticular reference to the continuance of sending supplies to Turkey.Turkish attitude from mitbreak of war between Italy and Great Britain untilthe German attack on Greece and Yugoslavia.2. The attitude of Turkey has been marked by a series of retrogressionssince the outbreak of war in the Mediterranean. On the entry of Italy into thewar against Great Britain in June 1940, Turkey failed to fulfil her obligations to come to the assistance of Great Britain under article 2 of the Treaty of mutual assistance. When the Italians attacked Greece in October 1940, and we imple-mented our guarantee to Greece, Turkey failed to carry out her obligation to cometo our assistance under article 3 of the Treaty.3. Early in 1941, Turkey assured us that she would go to war in the eventof a German attack on Greece or a threat to Salonica. But in the face of the increasing menace to the Balkans constituted by the rapid German infiltrationinto Bulgaria, Turkey did nothing to promote a united front with yugoslavia and Greece. The German occupation of Bulgaria, the Yugoslav coup d&apos;etat, and finally the German attack on Greece and Yugoslavia produced no reaction fromthe Turkish Government. In spite of the pressure maintained on them duringthe Secretary of State&apos;s visit to the Eastern Mediterranean in February, Marchand early April, the Turkish Government retreated further and further into a negative attitude and failed even to fulfil the promise given by the turkish minister for Foreign Affairs during his meeting with the Secretary of State atCyprus to send a message to stiffen the Yugoslavs. They have definitely declared their attitude towards the new hostilities as one of non-belligerency. All thatthey have done on the constructive side is to assure His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat they are prepared for German pressure and would refuse all demands. Thepublication of instructions for the preparations of evacuation measures inIstanbul and the fact that the Turkish High Command are withdrawing Turkishdivisions in Thrace and that Turkish troops are manning the Gallipoli Peninsulafacing the iEgean Sea may be interpreted as showing that the Turkish Govern-ment are alive to the possibility of an attack by Germany in the near future and propose to resist it.Probable Turkish attitude.4. The German attack on Yugoslavia and Greece brings the war much closer to Turkey&apos;s doors. Unless Germany can obtain possession of Syria by means of either direct invasion by air or sea it looks as though the Turkish Government11358   [22454]
are certain to be faced in the near future either with German demands (e.g., foraccession to the Tripartite Pact, concessions regarding the Straits or regardingcommercial exchanges) or with an actual German attack, the object in both casesbeing to enable the German armies to reach Syria. The Turkish Governmenthave informed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that no demands have as yet beenreceived from Germany, but they confidently expect them, and the german ambassador left Angora for consultations with his Government on the 17th April.5. A tug of war between ourselves and the Germans over Turkey seemstherefore likely to ensue. Provided that we consider that there is a good chanceof holding the Turks, clearly we should spare no effort to ensure that they do notcapitulate to German demands and stand up to a German attack. With eachsuccess the German position vis-a-vis Turkey becomes stronger, and our ownweaker, and we must clearly reckon on a period ahead during which german pressure of the strongest kind will be brought to bear on Turkey. It must beremembered that Germany is in a far better position for exercising pressure on Turkey than we are. Not only are her victorious armies in occupation of bulgaria and the Greek mainland, not only can Germany isolate Turkey in large measure and restrict her intercourse with Great Britain and Egypt, but she can withholdmany vital supplies which hitherto we have not been able to furnish, and at thesame time refuse to take Turkish commodities which hitherto have not found a market &quot;in Great Britain. Such, action would be all the more effective now that turkey has lost her growing Balkan markets. Any attempt on our part to exertpressure will merely accentuate the weight of pressure exercised by the Germans,increase the discontent felt by many Turkish business men over the loss of their long-established and profitable trade associations with Germany, and generallyresult in convincing the Turks that their only hope of economic salvation lies incoming to terms with the Germans. We on our side shall not have many cardsin our hand, and it may be anticipated that even greater influence than hithertowill be exercised by certain leaders in Turkey, notably M. Menemencoglu, who areimbued with the spirit of calculation, entirely divorced from any sentimentalfeelings, which has as its standard solely the welfare of Turkey. Such Turksare ultra-cautious and determined that Turkey shall not be launched into anadventure which might end ill for her. But even Turks, such as the Secretary-General, have a fundamental dislike of the Germans, and recall the humiliationsuffered by Turkey as an ally of Germany in the last war. They realise that withGermany dominant in Europe there is no future for modern Turkey, whosedevelopment along her self-appointed lines requires the survival and collaboration of the British Empire. We may therefore reckon with some confidence on the underlying loyalty of the Turkish leaders and Turkish people to the Britishcause. It is perhaps not too much to say that, so long as the Turks calculate thatwe can keep our heads above water in the struggle with Germany, they will wishto stand by us.What we ewpect of Turkey.6. The experience of the months since the outbreak of war in the Mediter-ranean, and particularly the personal contacts established with the TurkishGovernment during the Secretary of State&apos;s mission to the Eastern Mediter-ranean, have shown the difficulty of inducing the Turks to play any active role.The German attack on Yugoslavia and Greece and the increasingly strong position of Germany as a .result of her successes, render it still more unlikelythat for some time to come Turkey will venture to abandon a negative attitude.7. It may be worth a short digression to determine our basic conception of Turkey&apos;s strategic role in the war. At an earlier stage, before Germanpreparations for an attack on Greece and Yugoslavia were complete, we had hoped that Turkey might make common cause with the Greeks and Yugoslavs,thus forming a Balkan front with the object of deterring Germany from launchingan attack in the Balkans. At a later stage, when any possibility of a united frontbetween the three States had disappeared and when it was certain that Germanyintended to launch an attack, we hoped that the Turkish Government would atleast be prepared, while taking no offensive action, to declare war on Germany assoon as Germany attacked Greece. The object in that case was partly to assistthe Greeks by the deflection of German divisions to the Thracian frontier andpartly to stiffen the Yugoslav Government.
8, But our fundamental requirement of Turkey has been negative ratherthan positive; in the last resort we have always looked to her to play the passive,role of remaining benevolently neutral, and. denying herself to Germany, sinceTurkey is our chief bulwark in the Middle East and perhaps our most importantstrategic reserve for possible future offensive operations. It is unnecessary toelaborate the disadvantages which would result from the capitulation of Turkey to,Germany, whose object, when she has finished with the Greek campaign, will nodoubt be to secure passage of troops across Anatolia as part of the German pincermovement on Alexandria and the Canal and in pursuance of plans to secure the oil fields of Iraq and Iran.9. There was unanimous agreement among the Commanders-in-Chief,Middle East, in discussions during the Secretary of State&apos;s tour that it wouldnot be to our advantage that Turkey should take the offensive at the same time as Greece and Yugoslavia were attacked (unless this was the only means to ensurethat Yugoslavia should fight), since in her present state of unpreparedness andwith her lack of offensive power she would almost certainly be overrun, and weshould thus lose our buttress in the Middle East. It was for this reason that,during the Secretary of State&apos;s mission, the Turkish Government were neverasked to do more than take a political but not a military offensive.Present Policy towards Turkey.10. While bearing in mind the considerations set out in the preceding paragraphs, it is submitted that, other things being equal, the chief aim of ourpresent policy towards Turkey should be to ensure that she remains benevo-lently neutral and that our secondary aim should be to build up Turkisheconomy and war potential, improve the training and operational experience ofthe Turkish fighting forces, and. see that the Turks adopt the best strategicalplan of defence, with the object of ensuring that if attacked by Germany Turkeyis in a position to resist successfully. In this way we should hope to tide overthe present critical period during which German pressure on Turkey will coincide with Turkish doubts about our ability to hold our position in Egypt.11. The question then arises of the best method to secure this end.Broadly speaking two lines are open to us, either ii) to continue handling theTurks firmly or [ii) to ride them on an easy rein.12. If we adopt the first line, our attitude towards the Turkish Govern-ment would have to be somewhat as follows : We deplore their failure to co-operate in our recent attempts to form a united Balkan front to Germany, and cannot absolve them from a measureof blame for the collapse of Yugoslavia and the present difficulties of our-selves and the Greeks. Having received so many proofs of Turkey&apos;sunwillingness to face up to realities, we must seriously question whether we can continue to send her supplies and armaments, and hint that shemay stand little chance of getting supplies from the United States ofAmerica under the Lease Lend Act, unless we receive tangible proof of herdetermination to fulfil her obligations, for example, by breaking off relationswith Germany. We could hint that otherwise we may have to leaveTurkey to her fate.13. The effect of such an attitude on our part, in view of the weakness ofour position (see paragraph 5 above) and the experience of the past ten months,would be to intensify Turkish suspicions that we are attempting to drive them into the war before they are ready, and recall all the bitter memoides of the last war, when the Germans pushed the Turks in against their will. It would almost certainly result in driving the Turks sooner or later into the Germancamp with all the serious consequences to ourselves which that would entail.14. The alternative line to ride the Turks on an easy rein - appears more likely to produce results. Our attitude in that case would be one of sympatheticcomprehension of the Turkish point of view, and would studiously avoidrecriminations regarding Turkish shortcomings in the past. We should haveto abandon all idea of a positive attitude by Turkey for the present, not only inthe strategical sphere but also in the political sphere (e.g. breaking off relationswith Germany), and would acquiesce, tacitly or explicitly, in the turkish governments own view that for the present, Turkey&apos;s role should be passive
politically a,s well as strategically. Our aim, in brief, would be to make it plain to the Turks that we are not attempting to push them into the war, thatwe count on their fundamental loyalty and that we will do our best to put them in a condition to resist a German attack. This, to be successful, would entail:(1) supplying Turkey as quickly as possible with the balance of armamentspromised her under the Anglo-French agreements complementary to the Treaty of Mutual Assistance, as well as procuring for her from the United States of America material additional to what she has already been promised, and so meeting her main argument thather inability to come into the war is due to her unpreparedness,which, in its turn, is the result of our failure hitherto to provide her military deficiencies; and(2) supplying Turkey&apos;s civil requirements (mainly steel) and providing a market for her principal commodities, thus making it possible forher to maintain the deflection of her commercial exchanges fromGermany towards the sterling area, without which an effectivepolitical friendship with Great Britain is impossible. This wouldmean our providing not only those of Turkey&apos;s civil requirements which are likely to increase her war potential, but also a certainnumber of requirements (such as equipment and spare parts for theIstanbul transport system), our failure to supply which provide theGermans with a powerful weapon of propaganda.15. It maj* be objected that, even if it is conceded that it would be wise tocontinue to supply Turkey, yet we-^re not in a position, owing to recent developments in the Eastern Mediterranean, to deliver the goods. It is truethat the German occupation of Bulgaria and Greece will probably mean the closure of the iEgean to our shipping, but shipments to Mersiji are stillpracticable and should, we hope, continue so for some time to come. Evenif this route is closed, there always remains the land route from Basra ofwhich considerable and successful use is already being made, although it mustbe remembered that the greater the volume of traffic over this route, the greaterwill be the pressure on Vichy to put a stop to it. Nevertheless, materially, it remains possible to effect deliveries to Turkey of her military and civil require-ments. In order to ensure that deliveries are prompt and regular it would benecessary to proceed at once with the completion of the direct railway between turkey and Iraq and the general improvement of communications in Iraq,including the conversion of the Basra-Bagdad railway from narrow to broadgauge.Conclusions.16. To sum up, the most we can hope for is that Turkey will remainbenevolently neutral and resist if attacked. Assuming that we wish her to resist and that such resistance is likely to be to our advantage, it is submitted that we now have no alternative to riding the Turks on an easy rein and doing all we can to supply their material deficiencies, and that our policy towardsTurkey should be governed by the following principles : 1. Acquiescence in the Turkish view that Turkey&apos;s role must be a passiveone.2. Continuance and acceleration of the programme of supplies, both militaryand civil, to Turkey.3. Improvement of direct communications between Turkey and Iraq.4. Maximum efforts to put the Turkish armed forces in condition for war,by the despatch of further instructors, especially to improve the operational experience of the Turkish Air Force.5. Evolution  of the best military plan to meet a German advance on Turkey.   This turns on the question of the Turkish positions in thrace and the number of divisions kept in that area, and is beinghandled by General  Marshall-Cornwall and the British military mission in Turkey.A.
