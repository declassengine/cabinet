NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.Aircraft and U-Boats have inflicted heavy casualties on outward-bound convoys in the North-Western approaches.A pocket battleship has been sighted in the Indian Ocean.Northern Waters.2. H.M. Armed merchant cruiser Salopian intercepted the Finnish s.s. Anja(4,836 tons) to the westward of Iceland and escorted her to Reykjavik.On the 21st two Heinkels 111 unsuccessfully attacked the oil cisterns atThorshaven in the Faeroe Islands. ELM. Trawler Lincoln City was sunk and one enemy aircraft was shot down.Home Waters.3.   During the week units of the Fleet have afforded additional cover to ocean convoys.H.M. Minesweeper Bramble was attacked and damaged off Harwich by two aircrafts, one of which was shot down. On two nights in the week M.T.B.&apos;s have carried out anti-E-boat operations between Lowestoft and Harwich, but nocontacts were made. During the night of the 25th H.M. Destroyer Eaimoor,escorting a northbound convoy, was torpedoed and sunk by an E-boat offLowestoft.   Later in the night one ship in this convoy was sunk.H.M. Ocean Boarding vessel Manistee was torpedoed and sunk in the North-Western approaches on the 23rd.During an air raid on the night of the 19th/20th slight damage was caused to the docks at Swansea, and the British tug Queen Forth was sunk. some damage was caused to Chatham dockyard on the night of the 20th/21st, andslight damage to the Cardiff docks on the night of the 26th.Mediterranean4. During the week units of the Mediterranean fleet covered the passage oftwo battalions, in three cruisers, to Malta.H.M.S. Terror (15-inch Monitor) sank off Derna as a result of damage fromnear misses in two bombing attacks at Benghazi and off Derna on the 22nd andthe 23rd February respectively. There were no casualties. It has been necessaryto withdraw all ships from Benghazi due to the inadequacy of anti-aircraft defences and the lack of fighter protection. Five or six enemy aircraft have, how-ever, been shot down, including one torpedo aircraft by H.M.S. Peony. HM.Destroyer Dainty was sunk by aircraft off Tobruk on the 24th.Kasteloritzo Island (east of Dodecanese) was occupied on the 25th.East Africa and Indian Ocean,5.   H.M.S. Shropshire bombarded Modun (near Brava) on the 22nd, causing considerable damage to the whole area.Following two raider distress signals from merchantmen on the 21st and22nd respectively, H.M.S. Glasgow was ordered to investigate, and when about250 miles north of Madagascar her one effective aircraft sighted a pocket battle-ship steering S.S.E. At this time H.M.S. Glasgow was 40 to 50 miles to thenorthward, but, owing to reduced visibility, failed to make contact with theraider.   H.M. Ships in the vicinity have been disposed to search.On the 27th H.M.S. Leander sighted the armed Italian s.s Ramb 1 (3,667    tons), 250 miles W.S.W. of the Maldive Islands.   After a short engagement the crew abandoned ship after setting her on fire, and she sank shortly afterwards.One hundred prisoners were rescued.Red Sea.6. On the 21st, aircraft from H.M.S. Formidable again carried out a dive-bombing attack on Massawa.  Results were difficult to observe due to searchlights
and anti-aircraft fire, but it is considered probable that three destroyers and onesubmarine were hit. More than thirty-five merchantmen were reported in theanchorage.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. On the 22nd February three attacks on U-Boats in the North-western approaches were made by surface craft, but without visible results.H.M. Corvette Clematis attacked a contact near the Cape Verde Islands onthe 23rd, but no details have been received.Enemy Intelligence.German.8. Various reports of the movements of the battle cruisers Gneisenau andScharnhorst indicate that these ships are still in Norwegian waters and north ofOslo. It is suggested that they were moved out from German waters in the latter part of January to preserve their freedom of movement in view of a possibilityof being iced in and that, as the ice conditions in German naval ports have continued to be severe, they have been kept in Norway. Air reconnaissance onthe 26th February reported the battleship Tirpitz still in the Bauhafen atWilhelmshafen and the cruiser Seydlitz at Bremen. The Hipper Class cruiserhas been at Brest throughout the week. Photographs taken on the 25th Februarywere not large enough to make it possible to judge the results of the recent air attacks.Italian.9. An air reconnaissance of Taranto on the 20th February showed theLittorio class battleship to be still in dry dock. Five cruisers, six destroyers, two large auxiliaries and two small merchant ships were also in the harbour. a reconnaissance of Tripoli on the 26th February reported two cruisers andtwenty-seven merchant ships in the harbour, and two merchant ships with fourseaplanes entering the harbour.U-Boats.10. The number of German submarines in the North-Western Approacheshas been increased during the week from five or six on the 20th February to abouttwelve on the 26th; some of these are working closer into the coast than of late.There are possibly three or four Italians collaborating with them. Earlier inthe week there were rather more Italians at sea, but it is possible that several ofthem were patrolling or exercising in the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. Twenty-one ships and one small craft, a total of 89,759 tons, have beenreported lost by enemy action; of these all but two ships (6,060 tons) were British.Seven of these ships were sunk during the period under review. Six british ships (44,066 tons) were sunk by U-Boats in the North-Western approaches, three british ships (6,828 tons) by mines, one Esthonian (2,036 tons), five British ships and one small craft (16,668 tons) by aircraft, one British ship (1,585 tons) byunknown cause, and one Norwegian (3,924 tons) and four British ships(14,552 tons) by surface craft; two of the latter were in the homebound convoyattacked by a raider on the 12th. Eighteen ships, fifteen of which are British,and three small craft are reported damaged. Details of ships sunk and damagedare shown in Appendix I.12. On five days in the week under review Focke Wulf aircraft haveattacked outward-bound convoys in the North-Western approaches, causing considerable damage. Little U-Boat activity took place until the 24th, when5 ships were torpedoed in outward-bound convoys previously attacked by aircraft.An outward-bound convoy was attacked during the 26th and early on the 27th by both U-Boats and aircraft when about 250 miles west of the Bloody Foreland,and reports received up to the present indicate that fourteen ships were attacked.Three have sunk, three were set on fire and eight damaged.[22262] b
13. E-boats were active on the East coast and sank two British ships offCromer on the 19th and 26th respectively. A raider, subsequently identified asa pocket battleship, sank the British s.s. Canadian Cruiser (7,178 tons) 480 miles east by South of Mombasa on the 21st, and distress signals were received by theDutch s.s Rantav Pandjang (2,542 tons) in the same vicinity on the following-day, since when no reports have been received. On the same day the british.s. Trelawney (4,689 tons), outward bound to New York, signalled that she wasbeing fired on by a warship raider in a position 500 miles east of St. John&apos;s,Newfoundland. Three R.C.A.F. aircraft were ordered to search, but were unableto reach the position in daylight.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ended noon, Wednesday, the 26th February, 911 ships,including 153 allied and 19 neutral, were convoyed, of which nine were lost by enemy action. Three battleships, two cruisers, eight armed merchant cruisers,thirty-five destroyers and forty-two sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duty.15. Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the wreek ending the 22nd February totalled 931,443 tons compared with 933,382 tons during theprevious seven days. Oil imports totalled 360,251 tons in 35 tankers. mineral imports were 223,072 tons, of which 129,044 tons were steel, pig iron, scrap ironand iron ore. Timber imports were 29,542 tons and cereal imports 126,373 tons.Other food imports totalled 85,122 tons, of which 37,736 tons were sugar andmolasses, 10,806 tons were tea, 6,935 tons were refrigerated and tinned meat and4,222 tons were fruit. There were also large imports of aircraft, machinery,cotton and animal feeding stuffs.British Minelaying.16. During the week destroyers have laid mines off Brest, in the Havre area and off the north coast of Brittany. 240 more mines have been laid in the st. George&apos;s Channel. Minelaying by aircraft has taken place off the FrenchAtlantic and North-West German coasts.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.17. Although enemy minelaying from aircraft has been on a reduced scalethis week, mines have been dropped in the Humber as far up the river as Hull,and Plymouth, Falmouth and Liverpool Bay have been visited. Mines are alsosuspected off Stranraer, in the Clyde approaches and off Barrow. Eighty-onemagnetic or acoustic mines have been detonated during the week, twenty-nine of which were in the Humber area and eleven off Swansea. The Exmouthapproaches, Torbay and Swansea have been closed throughout the week,Sunderland until the 24th and Falmouth since that date.Foreign Waters.18. On the 22nd a few more mines were dropped in the Suez Canal, whichhas been closed throughout the week.A German contact mine, apparently in new condition, was destroyed nearDassen Island about 30 miles north-west of Capetown and a prohibited area has been established.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.19. A report has been received that, during the first week in February, aDanish ship and one 6,000-ton collier of the Stinnes Line struck British mines in the lower Elbe, and that off Borkum Rif a Danish ship of the Maersk line was recently sunk in a German minefield.
Shipments of iron ore from Sweden to Germany appear to have beendropping steadily during the winter months, only 684,740 tons having beenreported as delivered in December against 1,188,370 tons in October, this ispresumably due to the winter ice conditions, for, though Lulea was not actuallyclosed to shipping until the 25th December, the movements of ships had probably been hampered by ice for some time previously. As far as is known, no shipments of Swedish iron ore were made from Narvik during December, and these areexpected to be delayed till April or May owing to the difficulties of rebuildingthe port and railway.The Chilean authorities are said to have issued orders to prevent german ships from sailing from Chilean ports.   Seven German ships would be concernedtotalling 30,821 tons.Italian.20. Secret reports state that two Italian ships have recently struck Britishmines, the Ischia, 5,101 tons, in the Gulf of Taranto, and the Volta, 1,191 tons,to the south of Elba.Air reconnaissances carried out on the 22nd February showed that one ship of 17,000 tons and three of about 10,000 each were leaving Valona on a westerlycourse, while six ships of some 8,000 tons each were arriving. On the same daythree ships of 10,000 tons each, four of 5,000 tons each, and nine smaller ships were seen at Tripoli, while one ship of about 5,000 tons was half a mile to theeast of the harbour.Further information has now been received about the merchantmen whichwere still in Kismayu when our forces captured the port. The tanker Marchera,4,531 tons, was awash but was in fair condition, the Carso, 6,275 tons, was floodedaft but was otherwise in excellent condition, the Integritas, 5,952 tons, was awashand in bad condition. The Durmitor, 5,623 tons, a Yugoslav ship, was stillafloat and in good condition; she had been captured in the Indian Ocean last october by a merchant raider and a German prize crew had taken her intoKismayu. It is now thought that the Moncalieri, 5,723 tons, previously reportedto have been scuttled at Kismayu, was not there at all but at Massawa. Of thetwo missing ships of the sixteen originally at Kismayu, one is believed to havebeen the Duca Degli A bruzzi, 2,315 tons, and the other was probably the Somalia,2,699 tons, though, an alternative to this latter ship may have been the JapaneseYamayuri Maru, 5,028 tons, which was at Kismayu on the 10th December.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.Possible German Troops in Libya.21. For some time there have been persistent but unconfirmed reports ofthe presence of a German armoured division in the Naples area and in Sicily.It has been stated that these troops were destined for Libya.It is now reliably reported that on the 22nd February armoured cars withcrews wearing light blue uniform were seen near El Ageila. The uniform suggeststhe German Air Force, although it does not normally have armoured car units.The same reliable source confirms the presence of German advanced troops in theSirte area. ;   .On the 26th February, 1941, an official Italian communique, broadcast fromRome, stated that on the 24th February formations of the German contingent in africa made contact for the first time with British armoured detachmentsSouth-East of Agedabia (100 miles South of Benghazi).Another recent report from a source of unknown reliability states that two German armoured divisions have disembarked at Tripoli. Although this has notyet been,confirmed, it is quite probable that the Germans have sent some armouredtroops to the Sirte area, where German aerodromes are situated, as a precautionagainst a further rapid advance of British forces.
German Forces in the Balkans.22. Considerable quantities of war material are still moving into Bulgaria,but the open occupation of the country by German troops does not yet seem tohave begun. It is reported that Marshal List&apos;s H.Q. will be at Cham Koriya,35 miles S.S.E. of Sofia; a report dated the 25th February, 1941, states thathis arrival in Bulgaria has been postponed for the time being.Now that the identity of certain German divisions now in Roumania has beenestablished and the presence of various commanders has been reliably reported by name, it is possible to judge the value of the German forces in the Balkans.Germany has not denuded the Western front of all her best divisions andgenerals, but the army being assembled in Roumania contains a number of veryefficient and experienced armoured and infantry divisions and some well-triedgenerals.   It would, therefore, be unwise to under-estimate its value.Distribution of German Divisions.23. The total of identified German divisions is increased by two to 223.The only alteration in the distribution is an additional two in Roumania.Italy,24. Despite a constant flow of reports of the infiltration of Germans into italy, we have, for the first time, reliable indications of German activities there.So far, these have consisted in taking over control in northern Italy of customs and certain communications such as posts and telephones.Balkan States.A albania.25*. Reinforcements of men, supplies and war material continue to arrivefrom Italy. It is considered possible that the garrison is being maintained ata constant level of about 300,000.Crete.28. One British Infantry Battalion, one Field Battery and a constructionsection, Royal Signals, arrived at Crete on the 18th February.Yugoslavia.27. Recent reports indicate that the winter strength of the army has fallenbelow the figure of 500,000 given by the Yugoslav General Staff last December,one fairly reliable report stating that it had been reduced to 300,000, but was tobe increased in March. Information now received states that the intake of reservists is raising the strength by over 30 per cent. If the figure of 300,000was correct, the strength of the army should now be about 400,000.Hungary.28. It has not been possible to confirm recent reports regarding the manufac-ture of tanks by Ganz of Budapest, though there appears some reason for believing that light tanks are actually being produced in Hungary. The output is statedto aggregate 96 vehicles a month.Bulgaria.29. Although preparations of all kinds are proceeding for the eventual entry of German troops in force, the Bulgarians are having some difficulty in keepingto the time-table for this purpose; the arrangements are proving to be a con-siderable strain on the organising capacity of the Bulgarian General Staff.Railway congestion is reported at Corra Crekhovitsa, an important junction inNorthern Bulgaria, while the time-limits ordered for the concentration of supplies are having to be extended again and again. Meanwhile, the concentration ofBulgarian troops, whose morale is reported to be poor, is presenting serious difficulties; only 70,000 men out of the 80,000 stipulated are as yet estimated tobe on the Turkish frontier, although elements of at least seven divisions have
been located there; the new decision to reinforce the Yugoslav frontier is causing the Bulgarian General Staff additional embarrassment.The mountain resort of Tcham Koria, near Samokov, is being prepared as the headquarters of the German force and has been closed to the public. It is notyet clear to what extent the Bulgarians will retain control after the arrival ofMarshal List.A state of emergency was to have been proclaimed on the 20th February, inview of possible air action, but this has been postponed. Air raid wardens havenevertheless been told to remain on the alert.Troops on the Turkish frontier : (Part of)(Part of)(Part of)1st Div.

There has been little or no Italian military activity in Libya.Eritrea.31. The enemy are still holding Keren. In addition to the troops west ofKeren, a combined British and Free French force which has been advancing intoEritrea from the North has captured Cub Cub and is now south of Kelamet(25 miles north-east of Keren).A abyssinia.32. Mega18th February.(60 miles north-west of Moyale) was captured onPatriot activities in Abyssinia continue to be successful.theItalian Somaliland.33. The Juba River was crossed at Ionte on the 17th February and subse-quently at Mabungo. Our troops advancing along the coast captured Brava onthe 24th February and Mogadishu on the following day.Italian East Africa.34. The total strength of the Italian fighting troops on the various frontsof Italian East Africa on the 20th February, 1941, is estimated to have been63,620 white and 148,110 native.Far East.Thailand-Indo-China dispute.35. It is reported that agreement has been reached between the Thai, Frenchand Japanese delegates. By the proposed settlement, which has been referredto the respective Governments, the Mekong river would become the boundarybetween Thailand and Indo-China for 850 of the 1,200 miles of their mutualland frontier..

AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. Aircraft of Bomber Command have heavily attacked Brest, Dusseldorfand Cologne. Our bombers and fighters have supported operations against theItalians in Albania and East Africa. Malta has been heavily raided by Germandive-bombers.37. Operational aircraft battle casualties and extracts from recent RaidAssessment Reports are given in Appendices VI and VII.United Kingdom.38. Fighter Command flew 605 patrols involving 2,029 sorties by day, and293 patrols involving 458 sorties by night. Both these totals represent an increase over those of last week. Fighter sweeps over Northern France account for theincrease in the number of day sorties. Night fighter patrols have destroyed one enemy bomber, with two further probable successes.39. Except on the 22nd enemy activity by day was on the same small scaleas last week, and has consisted principally of coastal patrols and offensivereconnaissance flights over the east coast, where some ineffective bombing and machine-gunning took place. On the 22nd two fighter sweeps were made overKent and the Thames Estuary; about 190 enemy aircraft took part, the largest number employed against this country since November. Fifteen attacked Manstonaerodrome with bombs and cannon fire, but without causing serious damage.40. The attack on Swansea reported in last week&apos;s Resume was renewedon the two following nights by upwards of 100 aircraft on each occasion. Duringthe rest of the week scattered bombing has taken place in East coast districts, withcomparative concentration in the Humber area on the 22nd/23rd and 23rd/24th.On the following night bombing took place over most of the southern counties ofEngland and Wales without any apparent objective. None of these attacks wason a heavy scale. About 600 long-range bombers took part in operations against this country last week, of which about 60 were suspected of minelaying.Germany and Occupied Territory.41. During the week Bomber Command flew 23 sorties by day and 450 by night.   In addition Coastal Command flew 46 night-bombing sorties.42. Our fighter patrols operated over Northern France on five days. Fewenemy aircraft were encountered, but A.A. fire was generally heavy and accurate.On the 25th and 26th, an escort and screen was provided for a small bomber force which attacked shipping targets at Dunkirk and Calais. About 100 fighters were employed on each occasion. Weather conditions were not .suitable forunescorted day bombers and only three such sorties were successful againstBoulogne, Flushing and Ymuiden.43. Night bombing operations were undertaken on six nights. After threeconsecutive attacks on a lighter scale, over 60 aircraft bombed the docks at Breston the 24th/25th, and though intense A.A. and searchlight activity hinderedaccurate observation, many bombs were seen to fall in the dock area and tbstraddle the estimated position of the Hipper class cruiser. Equally heavy attacks were made on the following nights on the industrial centres of Dusseldorfand Cologne. On the latter, 77 tons of H.E. and 16,500 incendiaries were dropped.Our new Manchester bombers took part in these raids for the first time. earlier in the week, 24 Wellingtons started many large fires in the dock and industrial areas of Wilhelmshaven. Harassing attacks both by bombers and fighters havebeen made on more than 25 enemy aerodromes, and several night bombers were attacked and severely damaged if not destroyed. Boulogne, Calais and otherChannel ports have also been attacked and extensive damage done to the dockell16cLS.44. Leaflet raids over France, Holland and Germany have continued, and during the week over 1^ million leaflets have been released from free balloons.
Coastal Reconnaissance Patrols and Minelaying.45. Aircraft of Coastal Command flew 214 patrols involving 329 sorties :in addition 435 convoy escort sorties were flown, 115 of them by aircraft of fighter Command. The usual routine anti-submarine and photographic recon-reconnaissances have been flown, and a number of attacks on shipping have been madein the course of these patrols. A 4,000 ton merchant ship was left with a heavylist after being hit by two bombs from a Hudson off the Norwegian coast on the21st. Mines were laid on three nights, but not on a large scale, except on the20th/21st when 38 Hampdens laid mines off Brest.46. Enemy minelayers have been less active this week, only 60 aircrafthaving been so engaged, compared with 220 last week. Attacks on our shipping have continued both by bomber reconnaissance aircraft, and by aircraft of thelong-range unit from Bordeaux which have on occasion operated from Norway.Greece and Albania.47. Our Blenheims, escorted by Hurricanes, carried out many raids on enemy barracks, troops and communications in the Berat and Tepelene areas, andhave given valuable support to Greek ground forces. At least 70 such bombingsorties have been flown. On the 20th, Hurricanes shot down four enemy fighters and Gladiators two, and possibly three; the Gladiators were escorting twoWellingtons and a Greek bomber which had successfully dropped supplies to Greekadvanced troops.48. Enemy air activity was much reduced. Preveza was attacked three times unsuccessfully, and on a further occasion Blenheim fighters shot down threeout of the eight raiders.Malta.49. German aircraft approached the Island every day, and two, or possibly three, reconnaissance aircraft were shot down, but no attack developed until the26th, when a force of about twelve long-range bombers and thirty dive-bombers,escorted by 20-30 fighters, attacked Luqa aerodrome, destroying six of out-bombers and damaging eleven others. The aerodrome is likely to be unserviceablefor some days. Seven dive-bombers were destroyed, two by fighters, and elevenothers were probable casualties.   Three Hurricanes were shot down.Gibraltar.50.   During the week 24 reconnaissances and anti-submarine patrols were flown, and five convoy escorts provided-Sicily.51. Comiso and Catania aerodromes were attacked by six Wellingtons onthe night of the 20th/21st; at the former a hangar was hit and set on fire and fires broke out in the dispersal areas, possibly due to burning aircraft. At Cataniafires and explosions resulted, and many bombs fell on the runways.Egypt and North Africa.52. On the night of the 24-th-25th thirteen Wellingtons attacked Tripoliand hits were observed among shipping in the harbour, near the power station andon the quays, and many large fires were left burning. Subsequent photographs show the power station buildings to be burnt out. Four of the Wellingtonsoperated from Benina aerodrome, near Benghazi, the remainder from Malta.53. The Italians have left most of the activity to the German Air Force.Benghazi was raided several times and a Heinkel was destroyed by A.A. fire. Onthe 25th tlurricanes maintained a standing patrol over the town, but no enemy aircraft were encountered. Derna, Tobruk and the Suez Canal zone were also bombed but with little effect; German fighters destroyed a captured italian aircraft on the ground at Jedabya aerodrome.
Italian East Africa.54. In Eritrea there has been intense air activity mainly in support of our land forces in the Keren area. Principal targets have been aerodromes, groundpositions and communications at Keren, Asmara, Massawa, and Gura. Twopetrol dumps at Ada Ugri were destroyed by Hurricanes; at Massawa and Makaleat least sixteen aircraft were destroyed and six hangars severely damaged by hurricanes of the South African Air Force. Assab, Berbera and Dessie havealso been attacked, and considerable damage was done to the aerodrome atAddis Ababa.   The Addis-Jibuti railway was successfully bombed in two places.55. In Italian Somaliland close support was given to our land forces bythe S.A.A.F. Enemy troops, stores and communications were bombed, and manyreconnaissances were flown.Air Intelligence.France.56. The German Armistice Commission appears to have agreed in principle to the transfer to North Africa of the American aircraft now at Martinique. Theaircraft are of little value, but it seems possible that the Commission^ concurrence in the proposal may be dictated by the hope of eventually securing control of tiheaircraft carrier Beam, in which the material will be transported.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.57. Enemy activity has been on a small scale. Some bombing occurred inScotland, East Anglia, Cornwall and against aerodromes in the south-easternarea.By Night.58. Bombing has again slightly increased in intensity. Swansea was bombedheavily at the beginning of the period for the second and third nights in succession. Widespread bombing in London, East Anglia, the south and west of England resulted in very little industrial damage. Aerodromes appear tohave been singled out to some extent as targets.Damage.London.59. Six key points were hit, but there was only one case of substantialdamage. This was Redpath Brown&apos;s Riverside Works, in East Greenwich(Constructional Steel Works), where production was reduced to 75 per cent, of normal.A ward was demolished by H.E. at the Cheyne Hospital, a church damagedat Chigwell and schools at Wandsworth and Kensal Rise.Swansea.60. On each night the concentration of bombing was on the centre of thetown and adjacent working-class districts. The result was extensive damage to business premises and private houses, but comparatively little to industry. Themost serious effect on production was caused by the dislocation of utility services,all of which were affected.The railways were seriously disorganised. Traffic on the main G.W.R. line was suspended, High Street Station was closed and the L.M.S. line was blockedat Mumbles Road.  The situation was eased by diversion and the use of buses.Only four key points were hit; in all cases damage was slight, except in the docks where a shed containing degaussing equipment was destroyed by fire.
Elsewhere.61. Bombs have fallen on six R.A.F. aerodromes, all in Eastern parts ofthe country, but no serious damage has been reported.At Falmouth, Silley Cox&apos;s shipbuilding yard was hit and repairs will notbe completed for two weeks.In Kent, Snodland &apos; Gas Works were wrecked by parachute mine and136 square miles of Kent left without gas.At Slough, 44 bombs fell near Hawkers Aircraft Works on the night of the24th/25th, but only one caused slight damage.Casualties.62. For the week ending 0600 hours, the 26th February, casualties are estimated to have been 284 people killed and 433 injured, of which 200 were killed and 254 injured at Swansea.Damage to Houses.63. Up to the 15th February, 1941, the following damage to domestic house property in London and elsewhere has been reported :: Destroyed and damaged beyond repair *In LondonElsewhere (excluding Scotland)33,59560,290Seriously damaged but repairable In LondonElsewhere (excluding Scotland)123,395175,520[22262]

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany.Hanover. About the middle of December the oil refinery at Misburg was just recommencing production as a result of damage suffered some 6 monthspreviously. Informants who in the past have repeatedly criticised R.A.F.bombing in Germany have stated that the attack on the night of the10th/11th February caused very heavy damage and has made a deep impression on the civil and military authorities.Bremen. As a result of recent raids the casualties are said to be 1,000 killed and 7,000 injured.Wilhelmshaven. The attacks were more successful than those on Bremen,where the main docks were not so seriously damaged.General. Sources speak of the increased effectiveness of our bombing attackssince the middle of January and that the bombs appear to be more effective.Persons are now stating that the High Command Communiques must clearly have exaggerated the damage done to cities and towns in Great Britain for ifthey were true the population could not possibly stand it.Occupied Norway.Towards the end of October the iron foundry at Tolla Brug, 20 Kms. west of Trondheim was hit and damaged.Occupied France.Lille. As a result of heavy casualties consequent upon attacks on aerodromes in the neighbourhood as large a part of aerodrome personnel as is possible is nowbilleted at nights in the centre of the town.Rennes. The attack on the 16th November severely damaged the aerodromeand the arsenal.Bordeaux. The attack on the night of the 4th/5th February upon thesubmarine basin was successful and six Italian submarines suffered varying degrees of damage.Le Havre. Photographs taken by P.R.U. on the 6th February showed a submarine in the northern slip to be damaged, most probably as a result of a direct hit. The workshops attached to these building slips also showed very extensive damage. The present photographs confirm the extent of the damage and the yardappears to be in a state of considerable disorder. The submarine is no longer tobe seen and the impression gained is that she had been dismantled and possiblyremoved as scrap.Reports state that on the 12th January two ships in the harbour, loaded withcement, were sunk as a result of air attack. Troops have been withdrawn fromthe town on account of the frequent night attacks, as a result of which the harbouris said to be unserviceable for the embarkation of large units.Boulogne and Calais. Photographs taken by aircraft of Coastal Commandduring a daylight attack on the 10th February, show bursts on the Arsenald&apos;Artillerie, on barges, the quayside and property near the wet dock, near a telephone exchange and on property North-East of the inner harbour at Boulogne.Bursts are visible close to the railway sidings between the Bassin Carnot and theScouring Basin at Calais.APPENDIX VII.
