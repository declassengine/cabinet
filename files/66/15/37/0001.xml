(41) 64.March 19, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.NECESSITY FOR BASE FACILITIES IN EIRE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE paper on the necessity for Base facilities in Eire which has beensubmitted to the Cabinet by the Chiefs of Staff makes it desirable that thereshould be a general re-examination of our relations with that country.The economic policy towards Southern Ireland, which the Governmentadopted on the 2nd January, has now been in operation for nearly three months,and the time has come when we can take stock of it, and see what, if any, resultsit has achieved. Its main object, it will be remembered, was to open the eyes ofthe Irish people to their true situation. Since the outbreak of war, they had beenliving in a world of illusion. They thought that their products and their goodwillwere essential to Great Britain, that she could not afford to let them go short,much less to quarrel with them. They therefore sat comfortably back and submitted to the delicious process of being spoon-fed. They were confident that,if invasion came to their shores, the British Army would step in and defeat it;if they became short of any commodity, the. British Navy would convoy freshsupplies safely into their harbours. They need themselves do nothing. As a neutral, they would enjoy the protection which neutrality gives. As a memberof the British Commonwealth, they could claim the special advantages which such membership confers; and they could do so without any unpleasant feeling of gratitude to the hated Englishman. If Britain was helping Ireland, she wasnot doing it from any noble motive, but because it paid her. It was a very happysituation, and they saw no reason why it should not continue indefinitely.It can at any rate be claimed of the new policy that it has brought thatframe of mind to an end. The bubble of Irish complacency has effectively andwe may hope finally been pricked. The Southern Irish know now that Englandis not dependent on them and that, on the contrary, it is Ireland that is dependenton England. And this has been achieved without their being able to feel thatwe have deliberately subjected them to pressure. We have throughout beencareful, and wisely careful, to avoid giving them valid grounds for any suchsuspicion. We may, indeed, have refused to charter ships for them or to provide them with all the petrol, feeding stuffs, tea and other commodities of which theyare in need. But we have always done so on the basis of our own needs, and this argument has been incontrovertible. To-day Southern Ireland is veryuncomfortable, and she is going to become progressively more uncomfortable. Butfor this she is not able to blame us. The blame rests, first on Germany and secondly on herself.  It is a direct result of her policy of neutrality.   She depends[22332]
for her imports on the same pool of merchant shipping that supplies us. It is toher direct interest that the number of ships serving the two countries should notbe reduced. She could do much to prevent this by giving us the means to protect them in the dangerous waters round her shores. If they are still being sunk, andas a result she is suffering, she is herself largely responsible. Up to now, it istrue, the Irish leaders have been most unwilling to recognise this fact, for it leads to the unpleasant conclusion that neutrality is no longer possible for theircountry. But it is, by the logic of events, being forced more and more before theireyes. Mr. de Valera himself still continues to keep his gaze studiously avertedfrom such an unpleasant aspect of the situation. But there is evidence thatothers, less biassed and less obstinate, are beginning to face facts. At a privatemeeting of the Cosgrave Party in Dublin, Mr. Dillon, the Deputy Leader, said,in the course of his speech : &apos;&apos; We do not meet to-day as if things were normalor as if there were no world crisis. We are living under a Sword of Damoclesthat might fall to destroy freedom and man&apos;s right to adore God. All decentthings are being assailed by the most formidable combination that ever existedto destroy worship of God. It may be the policy of this Government to standneutral, but I am not neutral. The issue at stake means whether I want to liveor to die. I pray Germany and its rulers may be smashed by the Anglo-Americanalliance. I also pray that the day will dawn when a united Irish people will play their part in helping to smash Germany,&quot; and it is reported that thisparticular passage was loudly applauded by his audience. This shows a notablechange. Only a month ago, observers in Ireland were unanimous in saying that90&apos; per cent, of the population, irrespective of whether they normally supportedMr. de Valera or not, were behind his policy of neutrality. Now it is beginning to look not so good. Already some of those in the know are beginning to waver.Soon, their doubts may spread to the man in the street. The question is, can wedo anything to accelerate this process ?It is tempting to suggest that this is the moment for us to tighten the screwyet further. But I still believe that to do so would be dangerous, and might undoall the good we have clone. If the impression once gained currency that we weresqueezing Ireland, Mr, Dillon and everyone else would be bound to go against us.The policy that we are at present operating is in any case progressive. Everyweek that passes there will be less for Southern Ireland. I do not believe thatwe can with safety go faster. - There are, however, two other directions fromwhich pressure might safely and helpfully be brought, the Dominions and, evenmore, the United States. Already Mr. de Valera himself can be under noillusion as to the views that are held in America. He has had two crushinginterviews with Mr. Willkie and Colonel Donovan. Unfortunately, these were entirely confidential talks, and he may be depended on to see that the tenor ofhis visitors&apos; remarks will not leak out. It would be most useful if more could besaid publicly in the United States,&apos; both by members of the Administration andby the Leaders of Irish-American opinion. It would not be necessary for themto blame Eire. They could just point out, with irrefutable logic, that she iscutting her own throat. The same is true of the Dominions. Anything that could be said, either by the Dominion Prime Ministers or in the newspapers,would be valuable in driving home the truth.Parallel to this, and equally vital, is the exertion of direct pressure by theUnited States Administration, privately and officially, on Dublin. This appearsto have already started, and it may be expected to gain momentum, as supplies from America under the Lease and Lend Bill begin to reach this country.American opinion will not be at all anxious that the sinews of war, for whichthey are paying, should be unnecessarily consigned to the depths of the Atlantic.Should that happen there will be great indignation. Whether American opinion has yet moved to the point where the Administration could make a definiteproposition to the Eire Government is more doubtful. The facilities whichSouthern Ireland would have to provide, if shipping was to be adequatelyprotected, are pretty considerable. We talk of the ports; that is a generic term.In fact, as the Chiefs of Staffs paper shows, far. more is needed. Apart fromthe ports themselves, both in Western and Southern Ireland, there would have tobe aerodromes, and facilities for troops to protect those bases. What is neededis indeed something approaching a military occupation, something which, evenin these days, could hardly be described as compatible with neutrality. It wouldbe difficult, even impossible, for neutral America to urge such a course on neutral
1 8 9Ireland. But the United States, since the Presidents speech on the 15th March;is no longer strictly neutral. If she once begins to send her ships across the atlantic and to convoy them herself, the situation will at once entirely change.She could then well ask for facilities for herself, which could be extended tocover the British Navy and Air Force; and if it was the United States that wasthe principal in this negotiation, if it was she who leased the bases, it would bedifficult for the Eire Government to refuse. Their main objection, that theBritish, once returned to Ireland, would be unwilling to leave after the war,would be removed.In any case, the ball at present seems to lie with the United States.   They-alone seem likely to be in a position in the immediate future to bring sufficientpressure to force Southern Ireland to abandon her present negative attitude and take the action that is necessary for her own salvation as well as ours.I suggest therefore that (1) the moment has now arrived to approach thePresident, put before him frankly the whole position, as exposed in the Chiefs of staff paper, and obtain his views, and if possible his co-operation. If he showedhimself willing to take the initiative in an immediate approach to the IrishGovernment, so much the better. But to ask him to do this might well put him ina position of acute embarrassment, and if he refused we should have only put the clock back. We should, however, I submit, not conceal from him the fullseriousness of the situation arising from the Irish attitude, and its bearing onthe supply of American assistance to Britain.(2) We should also inform the Dominion Governments of the position, and invite them to intervene both in public and privately with the Eire Government.(3) In the meantime, we should continue our present policy, which may beexpected to have steadily increasing results.Finally, there is one other possible development. Sir John Maffey has bad, onthe 14th March, a very straight talk with Mr. Walshe, and has reported that, as aresult of this, he thinks it likely that Mr. de Valera may ask for a British Ministerto go over to Dublin to explain our strategic needs, ask what facilities we require,what protection we could offer, and what the future basis of understanding shouldbe. We could hardly refuse such an invitation were it offered, though of thisI am sceptical. But we must face the fact that this would presumably involve a definition of our attitude towards Partition. (Indeed, President Roosevelt may,as a result of our approach, outlined above, ask for our views on this point.)Mr. de Valera might well ask us to put forward proposals for the establishmentof an United Ireland. Personally, I do not feel that we should agree to do this.We have already made numerous attempts to solve the Partition problem, andthey have always failed owing to the intransigeance of Mr. de Valera himself.We should, I suggest, reply that we are not in principle opposed to the ending of partition, but that there are, for us, two vital considerations : First, any scheme that is adopted must satisfy the essential requirements of Ulster, and, secondly,it must guarantee, once and for all, our strategic security. If he can find a planthat will satisfy these two considerations, we shall be very glad to examine It most sympathetically.In the meantime, I will continue to emphasise to Mr. Dulanty what I havealready told him, that, if Eire does decide to abandon her neutrality and comeinto the war on our side, we will do our utmost to give her protection by sea, land and air, and that she shall, in fact, share and share alike with our own people.C.Dominions Office, March 19, 1941.
