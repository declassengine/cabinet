From: United States of America.DecypheraViGoouirtt Halifax (Washington)D.R.2ftth February, 1941.l-.t M*rch,  1941.1st K-rch,  1941.No. 937.MOST IMMEDIATE .My ^[^^g^B^iew^iQiQ^^I think that the cuestion of our treatment ofunoccupied France in the matter of food supplies isreaching the crucial stage in which deeper issues arelikely to he involved and I would he grateful for further-instructions as soon as possible02.   As you will know from my earlier telegrams,-President, Hull and Welles have repeatedly raised the .question with me and other members of my staff and thereare a good many indications that the problem is very muchin the mind of the State Department.    Horman Davisspoke&apos;to me very strongly two or three nights ago aboutthe importance that&quot;he thought the question of unoccupied france was assuming; not only or mainly from the humanitarian angle but rather from the political side.. -And it must be borne in mind that the Americans thinkprobably with -some reason that they have better meansof judging the political situation in Vichy than we have* .3&apos;:0    The State Department have not put up further&quot;proposals beyond the point in paragraph 2 of my telegramunder reference and I gather now that they will not do so..Atherton told Mr. Butler today that the United StatesGovernment had always taken the view that as regardsMetropolitan France they could not argue the Frenchcase to us but should use their good offices to - facilitatecontacts between Vichy and London, always with a view tohelping us to defeat Germany.-4.    He was personally convinced that there was now the opportunity for valuable Anglo-American co-operation,but if it was not taken he doubted whether it could recur&quot;.Presumably the position was that the French had handed in a written statement to the State Department-and UnitedStates.Embassy at Vichy of their urgent requirements-ofwheat between the end of March when last yearfs -harvestwill be exhausted,  and&apos; the end of June when the hew   -harvest will begin  A bo available.    They had indicatedreadiness to accept the four restrictive conditions which united-States Government thought essential - see-paragraph 2 of my telegram.    The French Ambassador herehas represented the State Department as giving rather moresupport to French desires than Is actually the case,, andis constantly pressing for. a reply.
5*    Dumaine. of the French Embassy called, here lastweek&apos; to explain tlTe &quot;proposals put to State Departmentsaying, tnsit unoccupied territories no longer got wheat from their, normal&apos;granaries in occupied parts of Prance,&apos;he stated .-that the quantity required for &quot;Soudure&quot; orthe period/stated above was some 8 million bushels; by cutting down &quot;bread ration with great severity, theirreducible minimum was 4,900,000. bushels; of these400,000 bushels were urgently required for the month..of&apos;March*   He&apos; stressed the political importance of showingthe French population that the British still can and.will help   theiru6a   ^therton basing himself no doubt on reports byLeahy and American Red Gross, expressed himself convincedthat something very like starvation was imminent inunoccupied territories and that the moment had come forHis -Majesty\s Government to take their difficult decisioneither to let some supplies through with American controland co-operation, or to take the 100% hard boiled line *In the latter case he feared that the United StatesGovernment would feel bound&apos; to drop out of the picture?and that Darlan would be convinced that he could not presentthe&apos;pinched people in the unoccupied territory with anysolid- fruits of the collaboration with the United States,and through the United States with ourselves;    and wouldsuccumb&apos;to the temptation, possibly bribed by Germanconcessions in. other spheres,  to try to run our blockadewith vessels possibly escorted by French warships *7.. Atherton described American sentiment as aboutevenly &quot;divided between humanitarians and those who thoughtthat we should be wise not to starve the unoccupiedterritory on the one hand;    and. those who would support usin the hard-boiled, policy on the other.    The position wasvery difficult for the Administration hut apart  from this,his personal conviction was, that there was much to be said for the British Government giving favourable considerationto the control plan which the French had submitted.   Hethought that by allowing 400,000 bushels to pass in Marohv/e could tide over a dangerous month, that the fourrestrictive conditions could be built up into a usefulorganisation,  and the quantities involved would in no waypermit stocks to he accumulated 9    He had. no illusionsabout Ad.miral Darlan who is completely opportunist, andhe believed that his present view that Germany would win,&apos;may easily change with&apos;circumstances.    He recognised thatthe industry of the un-occupied territories, which we willbe bolstering with food supplies, was no doubt supportingto some extent Germany&apos;s war effort against us *
8, I realise tile objections as summarised in        j,Ministry of Economic Warfare memorandum given toHopkins, to let food supplies through to the civicpopulation of unoccupied territory, and whenever thesubject has &quot;been mentioned to myself or staff, we     .have argued strongly for full maintenance of theblockade,,      On the other hand we have accepted, and       ; -the United States Government are strictly adhering tothe distinction between territories occupied byGermany and those that are not.      In this connexionDavis told me that he was pretty happy about being able to maintain this distinction which ijruerican opinioncould appreciate    I should think it serious if we woreto lose American CsrP&quot; undec.) to dealings withunoccupied territory, which may in certain circumstancesbecome very valuable.      I should also fear that if welose it on o.ie thing, we shall be likely to lose it on other important questions,  such as that of assistanceto Spain (jb e e y ourte 1 e gr am No.  1058&apos; 25 th F ebrjoar;y.)and that we might Telsl^uhf a^^^^aspects of our blockade policy, if we adhere rigidlyto- a line that the United States Government will thinkunreasonable.     For these reasons I feel from this end that we should be wise, for the sake of.our policy viewedas a whole, to allow the ..,mericans to.go&apos;forward withthe carefully limited and controlled plans which theyare convinced are practical for unoccupied France.The French Ambassador is to visit&apos; the State Departmentnext Tuesday.      The latter have asked whether (grp. undec.)His Majesty!s Government&apos;s attitude will be available by then.
Prom: UNITED .. STATES . OF AMERICA.Decypher.Vis count Hailif ax (Washington).28th February,  1941-.D..  10.  Op.m.28th February,  1941.6 .  0 a. m.1st March,  1941.No.  958.MOST IMMEDIATE,My immediately preceding telegram.While feeling that we should do well to make thisblockade concession in favour of unoccupied France.,  Iwonder whether we could not in our own interest link it up with general question of imports into that territory.2, It would seem to me logical to argue that ifthe situation is as serious as is suggested,  and ifunoccupied France can be treated as a separate (?unit)&apos;,-e remedy lies not in control of some, but in that ofall supplies imported, no matter from what source?Such control would be necessary so as to ensure that all supplies produced in or imported into unoccupied france would be   used exclusively in that area.and for.feeding its population alone.3. If you think that there is anything in theidea,  I could try it out on the &quot;tate Department,though I realise that they might   &quot;ell be reluctant to embark on such an extended United States control,,Also it is not unlikely that the Germans would not permitcontrol to operate in practice,    German rejection of proposal would however provide us with a good argument for use here if further proposals for shipments were put forward and had to be rejected by us.4. On the other hand,  if United States Governmentwould undertake control and German;? permit it we should,once total quantities to be imported were agreed upon,perhaps go far towards solving the problem ofshipments from North Africa and also from Martinique.
