SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (41) 73(Also Paper No. O.O.S. (41) 196)March 27, 1941TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken\to/ensure the secrecy of this document.IWEEKLY RESUME(No. 82)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon March 20th, to12 noon March 27th,1941[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT
naval SITUATION.General Review.Attacks by U-Boats and minelaying by enemy aircraft show a markeddecrease.  The shipping losses reported are high.In the Eastern Mediterranean one of our 8-inch cruisers has been seriously damaged by enemy &quot; one-man &quot; submarines, and our shipping has been attacked by aircraft.Heavy air raids on Malta have taken place.There is no further news of the German battle cruisersjKA strong force of our submarines is operating in the Bay of Biscay.Home and North Atlantic.2. As mentioned in the Resume of last week, the German battle cruisersGneisenau and Scharnhorst were reported as having been sighted by an aircraft from H.M.S. Ark Royal during the evening of the 20th in a position 600 miles.N.W. from Cape Einisterre, steering to the northward. Subsequent shadowingby aircraft was prevented by low visibility. At 2020 on the 21st an aircraft on patrol reported sighting two battleships or cruisers and one destroyer about130 miles W.S.W. from Brest, steering east at 20 knots. Naval units sent to intercept this force failed to locate them and further air search was prevented bythe weather. Although reconnaissance of St. Nazaire, Lorient and Bordeaux anda partial reconnaissance of Brest have since been made, no large ships have been located. A large number of our submarines are now disposed in the western partof the Bay of Biscay.3. On the 20th, H.M. Submarine Sturgeon off Obrestadt, made a successful attack on a tanker, believed to be the Norwegian s.s. Drafn (8,205 tons), whichwas last seen with only her stern above water. On the same day a Ju. 88 was shot down off Folkestone by H.M. Drifter Young Mon and H.M. Yacht Chico.During the night of the 24th/25th the British s.s. William Cash (1,186 tons)claimed to have damaged an E-boat off Sheringham by direct hits at short range.On the 26th, H.M. Minelayer Menestheus, operating 120 miles N.N.W. of cape Wrath, was attacked and slightly damaged by Focke-Wulfe aircraft.On the same day H.M.S. Versatile shot down an M.E. 110 off Harwich.In the enemy air attack on Plymouth during the night of the 21st/22nd, some damage was caused in the South Yard, the Royal Marine Barracks and theR.N. Hospital, but casualties were very slight.H.M.S. Prince of Wales, a new battleship of the King George V class, has arrived at Scapa. H.M.S. Exeter has rejoined the Fleet on completion of herrefit following the action with the German pocket battleship Graf Sj)ee off theRiver Plate.Mediterranean.4. A further report on the operations of the Fleet Air Arm, mentioned inthe Resume of last week, states that ships hit by torpedoes off Valona betweenthe 12th and 17th included a 20,000-ton liner and an 8,000-ton merchant vessel.One Swordfish was lost, but it is believed the crew are prisoners.On the 18th. H.M. Armed Boarding Vessel Rosaura was mined and sunk offTobruk.On the 21st, a Ju. 88 obtained three near misses on H.M. Destroyer Defender,which was escorted into Malta by fighters.During the period the 21st to 24th, the Mediterranean Fleet operated in theCentral Mediterranean covering various convoy movements. During these opera-tions one enemy reconnaissance aircraft was shot down and at least one other was damaged.  No enemy surface forces were sighted.Five air attacks were made on Malta between the 22nd and 24th, three bydaylight and two by night. Of these, two were made following the berthing of a convoy which had arrived from Alexandria during the forenoon of the 23rd.H.M.S. Bonaventure and H.M. Destroyer Griffin were slightly damaged by near misses, one rating being killed and two seriously wounded, while two ships ofthe convoy, s.s. City of Lincoln and s.s. Perthshire, sustained direct hits, some ofX 7 JUlxlaQlL JLk rw^r^\ JUgjUJ at  rod
the latter&apos;s cargo being burnt. The other attacks caused some damage inH.M. Dockyard, with slight casualties.On the 26th, H.M.S. York (8-inch cruiser) and the oiler Pericles were torpedoed in Suda Bay and were subsequently beached. The former had bothengine and boiler rooms flooded. This attack was made by six &quot;one-man&quot;submarines, two of them were blown up and one was recovered intact. Sixprisoners were captured.South Atlantic.5. On the 20th, H.M.S. Malaya was torpedoed 250 miles N.N.W. of cape verde Islands while escorting a homeward bound convoy from Sierra Leone.The damage is not serious and she is able to proceed at 14 knots.On the 22nd, H.M. Submarine Severn reported that she had shadowed anenemy merchant raider about 800 miles W.N.W. of Freetown, but lost contact atnightfall.Indian Ocean and Red Sea.6. On the 22nd, aircraft from HALS. Hermes carried out a search of theSouthern Maldive Islands.On the 23rd, H.M.S. Leander intercepted the French s.s. Charles L.D.(5,267 tons) and sent her into Mauritius under armed guard.On the same day the German s.s. Oder (8,516 tons), on being intercepted byH.M.S. Shoreham- in the vicinity of Perim while endeavouring to escape fromMassawa, blew herself up; 16 survivors were captured.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. On the 23rd a promising attack on a U-boat was made by H.M. ArmedBoarding Vessel Visenda about 270 miles westward of the Faroes. Two other attacks were made during the week by surface vessels in the North-western approaches without visible result.Enemy Intelligence.German.8. Air reconnaissance of Kiel on the 24th showed that a Hipper classcruiser was still there : the cruiser Leipzig was no longer in dry dock and was-not seen, nor was the pocket battleship Lutzow. The reconnaissance, however,was incomplete.Italian.Evidence of enemy transport activity to and from Tripoli has continued throughout the week, and on the 26th six destroyers, two torpedo boats and tenmerchant ships ranging from 9,000 to 1,000 tons were seen in the harbour. Inthe same reconnaissance a merchant ship of about 5,000 tons was seen to be in difficulties with her bows under water, two miles outside the harbour.U-boats.There seem to have been eight or nine German U-boats in the north-western approaches throughout the week, and four or five Italians until the last few days when some of the Italians were withdrawn and appear to have been concentrated in the Bay of Biscay. There were five or six in that area on the 26th. air reconnaissance of Lorient on the 19th showed 13 U-boats present, of which threewere in dry dock. Weather conditions have prevented satisfactory reconnais-sances of other French Atlantic ports.The most recent estimate of the total number of German U-boats available,for service is 90.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. During the week under review only two ships have been attacked by -boats, one in the north-western approaches and the other north of Cape Verde[22359] b
Island. Two ships were mined in the Thames. On the 21st, two ships were bombed and sunk in the Bristol Channel. Focke-Wulf aircraft attacked theBritish s.s. Beaverbrae (9,956 tons) in the north-western approaches on the 25thand again on the 26th, in consequence of which the ship is likely to be a total loss.The British s.s. Empire Mermaid (6,581 tons), in a homebound convoy fromHalifax, the cable ship Faraday (5,533 tons), off Milford Haven, and the british.s. Somali (6,809 tons), in an east coast convoy off Blyth, were also damaged by aircraft on the 26th. On the 25th, the British s.s. Britannia (8,799 tons), withRoyal Naval personnel and stores for India, reported that she was being shelledby a warship raider about 480 miles south of Cape Verde Island. In the Medi-terranean the Brazilian s.s. Taubate (5,055 tons), independently routed from cyprus to Alexandria, was damaged by near-miss bombs on the 22nd, and as aresult of a bombing attack on a convoy south-east of Crete the Greek s.s. NikolapsM. Embiricos (5,295 tons) was sunk and the Norwegian s.s. Solheim (8,070 tons)abandoned. The s.s. Bjonness is also believed to have been sunk. The twoNorwegian tankers Bianca (5,688 tons), bound from Greenock to Curacao, andPolykarp (6,405 tons), bound from Swansea to Aruba, are now known to havebeen captured by German warships on the 15th March and to have had prizecrews put on board. S.S. Bianca was intercepted by H.M. Ships on the 20th Marchwhen about 450 miles westward of Cape Finisterre, whereupon she was scuttledby the prize crew. Her crew and the crew of British s.s. San Casimiro (8,046 tons),which ship had suffered the same fate, have been landed at Gibraltar.In Appendix I twenty-two ships and three small craft (94,046 tons) havebeen reported lost by enemy action; of these, twelve ships and three small craft(55,688 tons) were British. Nineteen ships and two small craft, all but three ofwhich are British, are reported damaged.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ended noon, Wednesday, the 26th March, 911 ships,including 173 Allied and 21 neutral, were convoyed. Ten ships were reported lost in convoy. Five battleships, two cruisers, one seaplane carrier, eight armed merchant cruisers, three submarines, forty-two destroyers and thirty-seven sloopsand corvettes were employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the22nd March totalled 502,789 tons, compared with 1,122,061 tons during theprevious seven days. Oil imports were 162,299 tons in fifteen tankers. Importsof minerals were 159,095 tons, of which 123,902 tons were iron ore, scrap iron,pig iron and steel. Timber imports were 33,954 tons and cereal imports111,869 tons. Other food imports were 14,374 tons, of which 4,361 were tinnedmeats, bacon and hams, and 3,853 were fruit.There were satisfactory imports of machinery, airoraft and munitions.British Minelaying.11. On the 23rd March H.M.S. Icarus, Intrepid and Impulsive laid 70mines off Havre, and on the following day H.M.S. Abdiel laid 140 mines west of Ushant. On the 26th March H.M. Minelayers Southern Prince, Port Quebec,Agamemnon and Menesthenes laid 2,400 mines in the Iceland-Faroes passageand H.M.S. Plover laid 120 in the St. George&apos;s Channel.Between the 20th and 24th March aircraft minelaying was carried out on avery extensive scale off the French Atlantic Ports.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.12. During the heavy raid on the eastern districts of London during the night of the 19th/20th March, mines were dropped in the Thames as well as onshore. The following morning one mine was detonated by skid opposite BarkingCreek. Traffic has been very little interfered with, though it was stopped for atime between Tower Bridge and Barking Creek and has been stopped at lowwater when sweeping is being carried out. It is proposed to organise everyinterest on the river and riverside to co-operate as mine watchers.
The mine watching organisation on the Clyde is also being greatly strengthened. In the narrow upper reaches and at the Tail of the Bank protectedlook-out posts are being built every 400 yards, while the Clyde River Patrol isbeing concentrated on the wider lower reaches of the river.On the 22nd four mines were dropped close outside Harwich, otherwise there has been little minelaying from aircraft during the week.The dangerous area due to contact mines south-west of Dungeness wascancelled on the 22nd March, M/S Trawlers having cleared the area.More acoustic mines than magnetic have been detonated during the week, andmost of these have been in the Thames Estuary. Six acoustic mines weredetonated in thirty-three minutes on the 19th March.The mine totals to date are 1,015 magnetic, 427 acoustic and 848 contact.The dangerous areas in the Firth of Forth, and off Bridlington and in theDowns have been cancelled.On the 27th March, Torbay was the only port closed.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.13. The tanker Antarktis (10,711 tons) arrived at Ferrol and after dockingwas ready to sail on the 22nd March. The Gerda Vith (1,312 tons) sailed fromVigo during the night of 25th-26th March. The Elsa Essberger (6,103 tons) andthe Anneliese Essberger (5,173 tons) sailed from Kobe on the 23rd and 24th Marchrespectively. It has been reported that the Orinoco (9,660 tons) is preparing tosail from Tampico. The Tacoma (8,268 tons), which was interned at Montevideofollowing her activities with the Graf Spee, is reported to have received instruc-tions from her owners to be ready for sea by May. The tanker Rudolf Albrecht(3,817 tons) sailed from Teneriffe in the Canary Islands on the 23rd and is believed to have 2,000 tons of gas oil on board.MILITARY SITUATION.Spain and Portugal.14. Reports have been received to the effect that the German Army H.Q.in Bordeaux has moved to Biarritz and that several hundred German troops havebeen arriving on the Spanish frontier. There is no confirmation, however, of these reports, and recent air reconnaissance shows no unusual activity in that regionbeyond the widening of bridges and other long-term preparations.German Fifth Column activities on an increased scale in Portugal and alsoin the Cape Verde Islands are again reported.Italy.15. The official announcement of the resignation of Marshal Graziani fromhis offices as Chief of the Army Staff and Governor and Commander-in-Chief,Libya, was not unexpected. He has been succeeded as Chief of the Army Staff byGeneral Mario Roatta, and as Governor and Commander-in-Chief, Libya, byGeneral Italo Gariboldi.The appointment of Chief of the Army Staff should not be confused with thatof Chief of the General Staff, which is an office analogous to that of our Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence.Balkan States.Yugoslavia.16. At least twenty-one of Yugoslavians 30 divisions have by now beenmobilised, and seven armies have been constituted.
Roumania.17. A minimum of 19 German divisions is believed to be in Roumania.Troop movements from Hungary continue.Bulgaria,18. There&apos;are now believed to be at least sixteen complete German divisions in Bulgaria, and five moving in, the major concentrations being still probably in central and South-Western Bulgaria.A albania.19. During the week the Italians continued to attack at various pointsthroughout the whole front. They were unable to make any headway and have suffered severe losses.Greece.20. Reports indicate that the Germans have been completing their arrange-ments to attack Greece and that troop-carrying aircraft have arrived in South-East Europe.Turkey.21. It is reported that Germany will follow her Greek campaign by theoccupation of the whole of the Balkan Peninsula and, later, by an advancethrough Anatolia. Other reports speak of colonial troops in Bulgaria and thereis open talk in German military circles of a campaign through Turkey againstIraq and Egypt.The Germans do not usually disclose their future plans in such an openmanner, but the possibility of an attack on Turkey following the conclusion ofthe Greek campaign certainly exists.Soviet Russia.22. Reports suggesting that Germany intends to attack the U.S.S.R. this summer continue to be received but are not convincing. There is no doubt,however, that German activity in Finland continues possibly with a view tocontaining Soviet troops, possibly to distract Soviet attention from the Balkans.Germany is increasing the number of her troops in Poland.Africa.Libya.23. There has been no considerable increase in the number of German troopsin Tripolitania, which are estimated to consist of one light armoured division and elements of another armoured division.The Italian Order of Battle is somewhat obscure. It has been accepted pro-visionally as 6 divisions. Of these 4 infantry divisions belonged to the originalgarrison and are believed to be still short of divisional artillery, one is an armoured division thought to be undergoing completion with A.F.V&apos;s., and one is a motorised division whose presence in Libya has not yet been satisfactorilyconfirmed.On the 23rd March, one of our patrols destroyed 16 vehicles of an enemypatrol without suffering casualties themselves. Later they withdrew owing to heavy enemy air activity.On the 24th March, the enemy occupied Fort Agheila and are now using the aerodrome. Ground reconnaissance on the 24th March reported a minimum of20 M.13 tanks, 30 M.T. vehicles and some aircraft at Agheila. On the evening ofthe same day enemy tanks advanced 18 miles further east and thence turnedS.E.  There is no indication of German ground troops.Eritrea.24. The Italian garrison at Keren, which included the Granatieri di Savoiadivision formerly stationed in Addis Ababa, continued to hold out. Whilst it is realised that they were in a good defensive position, the enemy put up a stubborn
resistance, showing evidence of higher morale and better leadership than in Libya.The influence of H.R.H. The Duke of Aosta may have been a contributory factor,although his present whereabouts are not known.In the Keren area, on the night of the 22nd/23rd March, an enemy counter-attack was repulsed with heavy losses. In the Arresa area our mechanised troops are operating on the south side of the River Gash.A abyssinia.25. The Italians are withdrawing, presumably towards Addis Ababa andto the line of the Addis Ababa-Jibuti railway.Twenty prisoners and 14 machine guns were taken when the Marda Passwas captured. A patrol which reached Gojjiar captured 80 prisoners and someartillery with little opposition.Harar surrendered on the afternoon of the 26th March.United States of America.26.   The United States Bases Discussions are now completed.AIR SITUATION.General Review.27. Weather conditions were not generally favourable during the week.Bomber Command, however, carried out successful night attacks on Berlin,Lorient, Kiel and Hanover, and laid a large number of mines. Enemy ships werefreely attacked by both Coastal and Bomber Command aircraft and some direct hits were made.Operations against this country have been on a reduced scale. The enemy has resumed heavy attacks on Malta.It is no longer possible to summarise adequately the large amount of material in Raid Assessment Reports, and the appendix dealing with them is thereforediscontinued.  Operational Aircraft Battle Casualties are given in Appendix VI.Germany and Occupied Territory.28. During the week Bomber Command flew 69 sorties by day and 225 by night. In addition, some small offensive patrols over the Dutch coast were carried out by aircraft of Fighter Command, and Coastal Command Blenheimsbombed objectives in Northern France.Day.29. Daylight operations of Bomber Command consisted almost entirely of attacks on enemy coastal shipping, the total number of sorties being similar tothat of the previous week.A Coastal Command Blenheim made two direct hits on a large barrack blockat Quiberon, completely demolishing half of the block, while another Blenheim,after bombing the railway at Cherbourg, machine-gunned troops in the mainstreet of Barfleur from 100 feet.Night.30. The scale of night operations was much reduced; weather conditions were unfavourable and bomber aircraft operated on three nights only.31. On the 23rd/24th, 127 bombers were despatched; the largest number employed on any one night during the week. Of these, forty-eight attackedBerlin, the target being the inland port near Putlitzstrasse Station. A numberof heavy bombs were dropped, together with over 10,000 incendiaries. Severalfires were- started and bursts were observed, but cloud and. thick haze were encountered over the target, which, combined with the heavy A.A. fire andsearchlight glare, made it difficult to estimate results accurately. The industrialcentre at Kiel was also heavily and successfully attacked, eighteen tons of H.E.being dropped.   Hanover was bombed by Blenheims and, in addition to some[22359] c
large fires, three terrific green explosions were seen by aircraft returning from berlin. With the exception of one medium bomber, all our aircraft returned from these operations.32. On two other nights the submarine base at Lorient was attacked by atotal of sixty-nine aircraft, including Manchesters and a Stirling; 81 tons ofH.E. were dropped and many bombs were seen to straddle the docks, other burstsbeing in the region of the power station and smithery. Many targets were morelightly attacked, including the docks at Calais, Emden, Hamburg, Den fielderand Brest, and the oil storage at Rotterdam; Three hundred propaganda bagsof tea were dropped in the vicinity of Dutch towns, and leaflets were distributedover Northern France and Magdeburg.United Kingdom.33. Fighter Command flew 1,086 patrols, involving 2,694 sorties, by day,and 113 patrols, involving 231 sorties, by night.34. Enemy operations by day again consisted mainly of the usualreconnaissance flights and of attacks on shipping, and no serious attack has beenmade on objectives in this country, though on several days bombs were dropped in coastal districts and bombing and machine-gun attacks were made on a numberof aerodromes, without serious consequences. German fighters carried out smalloffensive sweeps over South-East England on the 24th, otherwise they have beenchiefly engaged in defensive patrols over the Straits of Dover and the Channel,and.off the Dutch coast. Weather conditions were generally unfavourable forinterception, but our fighters destroyed three enemy aircraft, probably destroyeda further three, and damaged four others.35. Apart from the first two nights of the period, when Plymouth wasattapked by about 170 aircraft on each night, bad weather has reduced nightbombing to negligible proportions, a total of only about 36 enemy bombers havingoperated over this country on the remaining nights. Our night fighters made nosuccessful interceptions, nor did German fighters meet with any success, though some twenty were operating over our bomber aerodromes on the night of the23rd/24th. Early in the week about twenty enemy aircraft were engaged inminelaying.Coastal Reconnaissance, Patrols and Mining.36. Aircraft of Coastal Command flew 141 pa,trols and photographicreconnaissances, involving 339 sorties. In addition, 345 sorties were made inprotection of convoys, and Fighter Command aircraft flew 604 sorties onthis duty.37. Coastal Command aircraft again made a number of attacks on enemy shipping. A merchant vessel of 6,000 tons entering Ijmuiden Harbour was last seen well down in the bow after being torpedoed by a Beaufort; a 2,000-ton ship at Egersund was set on fire as a result of two direct hits and was obviouslya total loss. Other attacks were made on E-boats, merchant vessels of varioussizes, coastal motor boats, flak ships, an escort vessel and minesweepers; again,some very near misses have been obtained, and in many instances machine-gunattacks were also made. During an attack on an E-boat acting as escort forthree other vessels off the Maas Light, our Blenheims were intercepted by enemy fighters and two failed to return.38. Each day Bomber Command also despatched Blenheims to attack enemycoastal shipping. A 5,000-ton tanker, accompanied by four destroyers, was attacked off the Belgian coast and a direct hit was made on her stern. Bombsstraddled a ship in convoy off Ijmuiden and a small fifty-foot boat marked with a white Swastika was sunk. At least twenty-four further attacks were made ona variety of naval and other vessels; as in previous attacks, many were probably damaged or suffered casualties, direct hits being escaped by only a very smallmargin.39. On the night of the 20th/21st the record number of forty-two aircraft were despatched by Bomber Command to lay mines in the vicinity of Brest,
Lorient and St. Nazaire, towards which ports two Scharnhorst-Class battle cruisers were believed to be making. Other sea mining operations were carriedout at the mouth of the Gironde and in the Fehmarn Channel.40. Enemy minelaying during the week was on a very small scale. Therewas, however, an increase in the number of long-range bombers engaged in raidingshipping and several attacks were reported.Egypt and Libya.41. No major air operations took place in Libya this week, though our bombers attacked Sirte and other objectives along the coastal road, and our fighters twice machine-gunned the landing ground at Marada, south of ElAgheila. Enemy shipping movements have been closely watched by our recon-naissance aircraft.42. There was a slight revival of Italian Air Force activity; a few offensivereconnaissances have been flown, during one of which bombs were dropped onBenghazi. German aircraft carried out four attacks on our forward troops atEl Agheila, but caused little damage. On the 23rd two aircraft, probably german, attacked the station at Soluch, S.S.E. of Benghazi, and destroyedseventeen coaches, some ration trucks and 12,000 gallons of petrol.Italian East Africa.43. Royal Air Force operations were again mainly directed against the defences and communications of Keren, where intensive bombing continuedthrough the week. The eastern column advancing on Harar has been assisted b3&quot;persistent and successful attacks on the Addis-Jibuti railway, and on enemy aerodromes. Apart from one attack on our aerodrome at Gorehai, south ofGabredarre, the Italian Air Force undertook no offensive operations, but theirfighters have been in evidence in the Keren area and have suffered heavy losses.Greece and Albania.44. Operations have continued in support of the Greek forces in Albania.On the 23rd, six Blenheims and a number of fighters carried out a successful attack on Berat aerodrome, where they destroyed four fighters on the ground andat least two and probably four in the air. Five Blenheims bombed enemy campsnear Buzi on the same day.45. Italian bombers and fighters attacked our aerodrome at Paramythia.North-West Greece, on the 22nd, destroying three and damaging two of our bombers, and losing at least one of their own aircraft. Fighters machine-gunnedour aerodrome at Heraklion, in Crete, on the 23rd and 25th, destroying onebomber and damaging two other aircraft.Dodecanese.46. On the 25th, four Blenheims bombed and machine-gunned the aerodromes at Scarpanto and Calato. Five He. lll&apos;s were severely damaged atScarpanto and a hit was registered on a merchant ship of 7,000 tons offAstropalia Island.Some air reinforcements have arrived in the Dodecanese, and there has been an increase in enemy activity, particularly of torpedo aircraft.Malta.47. The German Air Force has carried out a number of high-level and dive-bombing attacks on Malta. On the 22nd, ten Ju. 88&apos;s, escorted by twelve fighters,attacked the Grand Harbour, and one of the fighters was shot down: five of our fighters were lost. On the following day a total of about eighty fighters anddive-bombers again attacked the same objective; at least thirteen dive-bombers were destroyed, ten by our fighters, and many others were damaged. On this occasion we lost only one fighter, the pilot of which is safe. Two further attacks were made on the 24th, but no interception resulted.
Air Intelligence,Balkans. -48. German Air Force. The following information has been received during the week : (a) About 40 more dive-bombers have arrived in the area and 40 long-range bombers are expected.(b) Movements from Roumania to Bulgaria continue.   About 320 aircraft are now in Bulgaria, including all the dive-bombers in the Balkans(160), which are on aerodromes in the south-west.(c) Units of airborne troops are now in the Balkans.    About 250-300transport aircraft (capable of carrying 15 men each) are at Bucharest,but operations would probably be undertaken from Plovdiv, in bulgaria.49. Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Air Force is reported to be now fullymobilised and equipped. All fighter aircraft are fully armed and all bombersare complete with guns and the necessary instruments for bombing and nightflying. There are spare crews for most bombers and all pilots have had some experience in night flying, though only a few hours in some cases. Each group is provided with mobile wireless equipment.Dodecanese.- 50. Reinforcements to the extent of 10 long-range bombers and 10 fightershave arrived at Rhodes.Central Mediterranean.51. About 40 more German dive-bombers have arrived, from unitspreviously located in Northern France.UhMfi   CrTiJTDTTV   C T T T T A TlrtMGeneral.By Day.52.   Enemy   bombing   continued  on   a  small   scale   during   the   week.On the 20th March there were some isolated attacks in Kent and Sussex.Twelve casualties, including three fatal, were caused at Ramsgate and therewas considerable damage to residential property. During the following four daysonly minor bombing took place (causing slight damage) in South and South-east england and South Wales. On the 26th March there was wide-spread bombing and machine-gunning by single enemy aircraft mostly in the Southern Counties,at Gloucester and in Warwickshire. The only serious damage was at Totton(Southampton), where some Benzine cisterns and a Timber Yard were set on fire, one person being killed and eleven injured. The most serious casualties were at Yeovil, where seven people were killed, and at Gloucester, where five people were killed and twenty-seven injured. On the last day of the week, the27th March, up to mid-day the only incident reported was at Folkestone, wherea few bombs fell causing little damage.By Night.53. There has been a considerable decrease in enemy bombing, probably onaccount of bad weather.On the night of the 20th/21st March there was a serious attack on Plymouth.Bombs also fell in most of the southern counties and in a number of Londondistricts without causing any serious damage or casualties. On the following night there was a still heavier attack on Plymouth, which was, in fact, theenemy&apos;s sole target. On the 22nd/23rd and the 23rd/24th March there were onlyminor incidents and very little damage. The remaining nights of the week passedquietly, the whole country being free from bombing.
Damage at Plymouth.54. The first attack on Plymouth lasted for 2 hours, and the second andheavier attack for nearly 4 hours. The municipal and commercial centre of thecity was almost wholly destroyed by fire, as the water supply broke down entirely.All buildings within an area of a quarter of a mile east and west of the Guildhall,and 300 yards north and south of it are to be demolished. Amongst the public buildings damaged are the Guildhall, Municipal Buildings, the Old Guildhall,the County Court, the G.P.O., Pounds House, the Prince of Wales Hospital,8 Churches and 6 schools. Some 5,000 people were rendered homeless and about,500 houses damaged.The main concentration of bombing was on the central, Millbay and Docksareas, where there are almost no Key Point Factories. Naval establishmentsescaped lightly, the barracks and victualling yard being untouched.Transport was seriously disorganised. The G.W.R. and S.R. stations were both damaged and two trains were burnt out, one containing several wagon loadsof ammunition.Casualties.55. For the period 0600 hrs. the 19th March to 0600 hrs. the 26th Marchcasualties for the whole country were estimated at 948 killed, 1,543 seriously injured.
