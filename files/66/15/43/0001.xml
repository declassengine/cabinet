Copy No. 4 O?6th^ arch; 1941.---&quot; WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS VICHY SHIPPING-.Note &quot;by Minister of Ship-ping.1. On 20th March the War Cabinet decided to allow two French ships loaded withfood to proceed to unoccupied France from the United States.     I had hoped that,if as a result of American representations we were forced to make any concession in our blockade of France, we might be able to insist upon a quid pro quo fromthe French.-2. The French are depriving us at the instance of the enemy of the use of nearly 250,000 tons of British and allied shipping detained in unoccupiedFrench ports, mainly in North Africa.3. Is it still possible to require the French, in return for our concession in allowing two French ships to proceed with food to France, to releaseequivalent British or Allied tonnage from Morocco with cargo that we require?If it is too late now to propose such an arrangement in respect of the two ships referred to in the Cabinet Minutes I hope that the proposal can beconsidered before any further concessions are made.k-. I would like to make sure that the shipping implications of any future action of this type are recognised.     We are making a present to Vichy, notonly of two cargoes, but of two good ocean carriers - one a modern motor vessel -which had been immobilised in New York since last summer,   and might otherwiseeventually have come into our service.     We are co-operating in releasing this tonnage to Vichy and assuring its safe passage while Vichy is not only refusing to release British, Allied and neutral ships, but is pressing some of them into service, not only to unoccupied France but to enemy destinations.     For instance,the Norwegian tanker JASPIS was forcibly taken over at Casablanca and sent toBordeaux on 25th February, and an ex-Dane, the SALLY MAERSK, which we capturedand brought into Gibraltar recently, was found to be carrying cargo consigned to Italy.5. Even more disturbing is the danger that by raising false expectationsabroad, we may be manoeuvred into the position of no longer being able to detain Vichy vessels and bring them into our service without creating serious repercussions.     In the last five months we have taken for our service nearly100,000 gross tons of intercepted Vichy shipping, including troopships, generalcarriers, and vessels useful as fleet auxiliaries.     We cannot afford to foregoor curtail such a contribution in the present shipping situation.6. There is one further shipping point whose relevance may not have been fullybrought out in previous discussions.     We have offered not only to restore atthe end of the war such ships as we are forced to take from Vichy, but also to compensate their owners for their use.     The more of these ships we take, themore funds, which the enemy cannot touch, are accruing to influential people in France.     Knowledge of this may well assist in increasing French interestin our success, especially as the franc dispreciates.R.H.C.Ministry of Shipping,26th March, 1%.!.
