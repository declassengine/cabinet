THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1941.SECRET. Copy No^W.P. (41) 59.March 8, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.NECESSITY FOR BASE FACILITIES IN EIRE.Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff.The Present Position.WE need to base naval and air forces in Eire for two reasons : In defenceof our trade and in defence of Eire territory, both vital to our existence.Defence of Trade.2. Our Atlantic trade is suffering very severe losses from U-boat and air attacks in the Western Approaches. Our merchant shipping situation is causinggrave and increasing anxiety. Anti-invasion and trade protection requirements in the North Sea and narrow waters and our many commitments overseas at thepresent time do not allow us to increase the numbers of naval escorts allocated to Atlantic trade. Increased protection can only be given by operating our navaland air forces from bases in Eire nearer to the area of enemy attack.3. Owing to the threat of air attack in the South-Western Approaches,we have had to route all our ocean trade North-about round Ireland. This addsto the density of shipping in the North-Western Approaches. The enemy ha,snow extended his air attacks to this area. There are also indications that thescale of air attack is about to be considerably increased by the diversion ofGerman long-range bombers from night bombing to attack on shipping.4. If we could obtain air bases in Eire not only could we improve thedefence, against these attacks, but we could extend our air reconnaissance andescorts, and we could reduce the air threat to our shipping in the St. George&apos;s channel and to West coast ports, such as Liverpool and Bristol. The establish-ment of fighters in Southern and Eastern Eire might enable us to reopen theSouth-Western Approaches to trade.5. Our aircraft are additionally handicapped at their present bases byfrequent fogs during the winter months. Much less fog is experienced on theWest coast of Eire.6. Our trade would also be threatened by a concentration of enemy surfaceforces in the Biscay ports. The movement of further enemy surface forces along the French Channel coast under cover of the German air force will be difficultto prevent. By basing our own heavy surface forces on Eire ports, we shouldbe in a far better position to intercept enemy surface forces in the Atlantic than from Plymouth or Milford Haven. Moreover, these latter ports are within range of enemy dive bombers and long-range fighters, and cannot obtain adequatewarning of air attack.[22314]
Defence of Eire against invasion.7. The enemy&apos;s preparations for invasion continue. The increased defencesof Great Britain may decide him to attempt the invasion of Eire by means of an expedition carried in ocean-going vessels, either from French ports or from norway. Alternatively, the invasion of Eire might be attempted as a diversionduring an invasion of Great Britain. If the enemy succeeded in establishing and maintaining himself in Eire, this would create a mortal threat against both our trade and our West coast ports.8. The presence of British naval and air forces based in Eire would be astrong deterrent against an invasion of Eire; and, if an invasion were attempted,would make more probable its defeat at sea or on arrival.Our Requirements.9.   Naval. We require : (a) to base light craft in the Shannon and Lough Swilly in order toincrease the density of our naval escorts.(b) to base heavy ships in the Shannon to counter any operations against our Atlantic trade by enemy surface forces working from theBiscay ports, and as a deterrent against an invasion of Eire.(c) to install A.A. and underwater defences and moorings in the Shannonand Lough Swilly.10.   dir. We require :  (a) to operate reconnaissance and bomber forces from defended bases in western Eire. wThere there is much less fog, in order to extend the range of our air reconnaissance and to afford protection toconvoys and against invasion.(b) to establish fighter defences for our base in the Shannon, and to basefighters in South-East and Eastern Eire to cover the St. George&apos;s channel and the Irish Sea and our own West coast ports, and against the threat of an invasion of Eire.(c) to establish an air defence organisation around the South and Eastcoasts of Eire, in order to enable our fighters to operate with fullefficiency.The Effect if these Facilities are Granted.11. If these facilities were granted, the security of our Atlantic trade wouldbe immensely increased, Eire would be reasonably safe from invasion, and the air defence of our own West coast ports would be improved. It may even prove possible to reopen the South-Western Approaches to our ocean trade. In short,our vital security in home waters, which is at present gravely threatened by our inability to make use of bases in Eire, would be immeasurably strengthened, andour most serious anxieties would be largely relieved.Effect of United, States Intervention.12. In the event of the active intervention of the United States of Americathey would desire the use of bases in Eire for their Naval forces operating in theWestern Approaches. Mr. De Valera might, perhaps-, be less unwilling to makebases in Eire available for United States forces than for British forces; on theother hand, in the interests of security, it is undesirable that any indication ofthe progress of our discussions with the Americans should be conveyed toMr. De Valera.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.C.
