TURN ROUND OF SHIPPINGMemorandum by the Prime Minister.I HAVE been making further enquiries into the causes of the delays in the turn round of shipping, and I should be glad if the Ministers- concerned wouldgive urgent consideration to the following points:  Crew Troubles.2. Flag Officers at ports have reported that there apparently exists an organised system of skulking which delays the sailing of merchant ships. the technique is that one or two men break their leave, and thus prevent the shipfrom sailing; while their messmates pay the fines subsequently imposed. the remedy is obviously (1) a pool; (2) punishment in gaol.I am advised that the Minister of Shipping has this matter under considera-tion, and I should be glad to have, a report of what can be done.Shortage of Cranes, &amp;c.3. There is a shortage of all cranes, particularly of the runabout type of light crane, at both large and small ports. This type is an urgent necessity, if thepermanent wharf crane lines are damaged by air raid.I am advised that the Minister of Transport has a number of these craneson order, but that it is only very recently that they have been given Priority 1 (a).Why has this not been reported before?Fire Fighting.4. The timely provision of 2,000. soldiers to reinforce the fire fightingorganisation at Liverpool was responsible for saving considerable damage during recent raids on that port. If similar reinforcements are required at other ports,particularly those through which we now have to breathe, the matter should betaken up with the War Office at once. ,Inland Sorting Depots.5. It was recommended in Lord Chatfield&apos;s Report of March 1940 (W.P. (G)(40) 83, paragraph 10) that inland sorting depots should be set up in order to[22331]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET Copy No.
relieve congestion at the ports. Although this suggestion was approved by theWar Cabinet, I am advised that nothing, or practically nothing, has yet been done.Why is this ? Even now make-shift sheds could be erected very quickly atsuitable, sites.  Let me have proposals at an early date.Bulk Cargoes of Steel.6. I am told that ships carrying heavy cargoes of steel have suffered serious damage through rock-about during the severe winter weather. If the supply situation permits, further imports of bulk steel should be suspended until the better weather sets in, the ships being used for bringing in food cargoes, e.g.,canned meat from the U.SA.Facilities in Canadian Ports.7. If the facilities for effecting running repairs to merchant ships in american and Canadian ports could be improved, there would be a considerableeasement on our own repair yards. The Minister of Shipping should take up this matter and report urgently what can be done.Canadian Coal.8. It has been suggested to me that ships proceeding to Canada in ballastmight take Welsh coal with a view to building up a stock at Halifax. This would save their having to use poor quality Dominion coal on the return journey thus reducing stragglers.The political objections to this proposal must be overcome.Sea Transport Department.9. The occupation by the Sea Transport Department of berths for conversionwork on transports must be carefully watched, in order to ensure that they do notoccupy them for an unduly long time.Controller of Inward Transport.10. The question of the appointment of a Controller of Inward Transport,who would have executive power to co-ordinate all forms of transport with aview to the rapid clearance of ports, is open. There may be objections to thisproposal, and it might be difficult to find the right man for the appointment, butI should be glad if the Import Executive would give the matter their attention and let me have their views.(Intld.)
