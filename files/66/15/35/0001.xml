(41) 62.March 18, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE BATTLE OF THE ATLANTIC.Note by the Secretary.THE following Papers, which relate to the Directive dated the 6th March,.1941, by the Minister of Defence on the Battle of the Atlantic, are circulated for information : Annex     I. Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty, datedthe 11th March, 1941.Annex   II. Note by the Chief of the Air Staff, dated the 12th March,.1941.Annex III. Report by the Chiefs of Staff, dated the 15th March, 194L(Also Paper No. C.O.S. (41) 168.)(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Great George Street, S.W. 1,March 18, 1941.ANNEX I.(Most Secret.)Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.Prime Minister,I HAYE considered with my advisers your directive on the steps to be takento meet the new German attack on our trade, and I now submit the following report.   The references are to the paragraphs in your directive : Paragraph 1.We shall, of course, continue to devote our utmost endeavours to hunting theU-boat at sea. We welcome the high priority among bombing targets given by;your directive to the U-boat and Fokke-Wulf Works and bases. Our convoycaptains confirm that the raids which the R.A.F. carried out on the Fokke-Wulfaerodrome were followed by a marked gap in their attacks. The number of suchtargets requiring attention by our bombers has nowr increased as the enemy havealready allocated other types of aircraft for attack on our shipping. We should like to suggest that, in addition to the aircraft factories, the Air Ministry should[22330] copy No.
also bomb the German torpedo factories, especially as there are certain! signswhich may mean that the Germans are meeting with certain difficulties in torpedoproduction.Paragraph 2.We are also very grateful for the extreme priority which you have given tothe fitting out of merchant ships to carry fighters. I had previously pressed theProduction Executive unsuccessfully for 1 (a) priority for the first of the niercan-tile aircraft carriers. I am assuming that this vessel now has that priority, andwe have also instructed contractors that they may regard all work for catapultand similar gear as covered by 1 (a)- priority.We hope to have 4 ocean-boarding vessels fitted with catapults or rockettake-off gear in service by early April. We have ordered 20 sets of rocket take-offgear for merchant ships which it is intended to fit in new ships completing. Itis hoped to start fitting the first of these about the middle of April.We regard this, however, as only preliminary, and feel that the aim shouldbe 200 such vessels. This would give us 4 for every main ocean convoy. We arealso considering fitting additional O.B.Vs. to form a kind of flying squad ofcatapult ships. We are studying the problem of preserving the aircraft againstweather damage.Very shortly we shall present to the Production Executive a detailed state-ment of the way in which we should wish to apply the extreme priority which you have accorded.Paragraph 3.Coastal Command are already concentrating on the North-West Approaches.We understand that the limiting factor is aerodrome accommodation in this area and urge that every possible measure should be taken to expedite their completionI dor ability to operate aircraft.We understand that only 6 of the 15 new squadrons promised for coastal command by June 1941 have yet formed and urge all possible acceleration.We attach importance to retaining in service the Londons and Stranraerswhich are now being replaced in certain squadrons by newer aircraft. Some ofthem will be needed to replace flying boats at present used for training, but we hope some will remain operational.Coastal Command expect to have a Squadron operating from Iceland at theend of the month. A further increase in the number of aircraft available in iceland would be of the greatest importance with the lengthening daylight hours in these latitudes.Paragraph 4.We have already stopped stage II work on the Town Class destroyers.paragraph 5.We are re-examining this question of sailing the 12-knot ships independently,but experience with independent ships up to date shows that risk rises rapidly asspeed decreases. With ships of over 15 knots speed the risk of loss is only -7 per cent., but with those between 13 and 15 knots the risk is 3-5 per cent.If it were decided to reduce the speed limit to 12 knots, twenty-two additionalindependent ships per week would pass through the danger area. This would greatly add to the difficulty of control and the chances of keeping them clear of u-boats would be diminished.All our discussions on this subject have brought out ever more clearly whatan invaluable contribution it would be to get twelve or more of the fast cargoliners now completing in the United States to form a fast convoy group. Itappears to us vital that, if we are to hold out through the long period before thenew American programmes begin to produce results, we should obtain largereinforcements from ships now coming off the stocks in the United States. Itmay be possible as soon as the Lease-and-Lend Bill is through to make greaterprogress in this direction.
Paragraph 6.A.A. Guns.-We expect to mount 5 Bofors a day, so that a programme for montlhs should absorb over 300. The present difficulty is to find ships at this rate on the West Coast and orders have now been issued for the mounting of guns to take place in East Coast ports as well. 17 Bofors have been installed up tothe 12th March, all of which are at sea. Special Army crews are being provided with the guns.U.P.&apos;s. 1,050 14-barrel W.P. mountings have been ordered. When we havehad experience of these we will review the situation. The first fifty are expected in 2 weeks&apos; time, and the whole of this first order should be completed in 3 months.Two models of an improved type of mounting are also on order.P.A.C.&apos;s. 15,000 of the powder-filled type are on order and are being supplied to us at the rate of 250 projectors per week. 1.300 are now inmerchant ships. A new model has just been produced, which marks a tremendous-advance. A share of the production of the new models would be a valuable contribution to the defence of our shipping. We realise the Air Ministry wantthem for the protection of aerodromes, but we could absorb 1,000 pairs ofprojectors and 4,000 rockets and cables of each type per week. The question of stopping the production of the powder type will be considered when we can be assured that supplies of the new type are available. In the meantime, we shouldappreciate an increase m supplies of the powder type up to 1,000 projectors,a week.Paragraph 8.As you know, we have already given orders according a certain priority to merchant ship repairs over new construction of both kinds. We are arrangingthat there shall be no transfer from new tonnage which can be completed by september 1941. Every effort will be made to achieve, and, if possible, surpass,the objective which you have laid down. We hope that with better weather theamount of marine risk damage will decline. At present it accounts for over80 per cent, of damage to merchant ships. Recently, we have been encouraged by the number of ships which have remained afloat after being torpedoed, and,but for the gales, might well have been brought in. It is possible, therefore, thatwhen the weather improves we shall salve more torpedoed ships and that thenumber of big repair jobs due to enemy action will go up, whilst the winterweather damage is coming down.Paragraph 9.\ , Port Officers have been asked to report in accordance with this direction.All our N.C.S.O.&apos;s met at the Admiralty on Tuesday, the 11th March, to discuss,causes of delay in Port and suggest improvements, and Flag Officers-in-Chargeare coming for a similar meeting on Thursday, the 13th March. The Ministryof Shipping have been asked to do the same with their representatives.We have already given instructions to reduce degaussing equipment and repairs to the minimum, consistent with reasonable safety.Paragraph 10. :.Following on the measures which the Minister of Labour is taking to findfresh supplies of shipbuilding and ship-repairing labour, the Admiralty have setup a Directorate of Contract Labour to control labour in these industries and tosee that proper provision is made for training, dilution and welfare. The newDirectorate will have a section which will assist the Ministry of Labour&apos;spropaganda programme. The organisation of the industry itself will be tightenedup by the establishment in each district of a local control composed of the warshipProduction Superintendent, the Merchant Repair Licensing Officer and theLabour Supply Officer, under the Flag Officer-in-Cbarge.Paragraph 12. , ,The small Committee to watch port delays has been in being since the3rd March. The Ministry of Shipping is represented by Sir Percy Bates, theMinistry of Transport by Mr. Tolerton, and the Admiralty by Admiral Moore.They are submitting a report through the Chairman of the Import Executive inaccordance with your instructions. . .,j[22330] .

Paragraph 13.; v This is a matter for the Ministry of Shipping, but I understand that theyhave sent telegrams to their representatives abroad stressing the need for everyeffort to&apos; secure rapid turn-round of ships. There are still not yet enough guns to provide defensive armament other than machine guns for all the Allied ships,and this sometimes causes trouble with crews at ports abroad. We shall do every-thing possible within the limits of our resources to remove such difficulties, but agreater supply of guns will be needed to do it quickly. The question of puttingBritish gun crews into Allied ships is being discussed with the Ministry ofShipping.A. V. A.March 11, 1941.ANNEX II.Note by the Chief of the Air Staff.IN paragraphs 1, 3, 6 and 7 of his Directive on the 6th March, 1941, on the battle of the Atlantic, the Minister of Defence referred to certain operationalmeasures to be taken by the Air Ministry, or with which the Air Ministry isclosely concerned.-Coastal Command.2. In regard to paragraph 3 of that Directive, the following reinforcements to Northern Ireland have now been completed :  The Whitley Squadron (No. 502) which was formerly stationed atAldergrove and Limavady has been increased from 16 to 20 aircraft andconcentrated at Limavady.8 Hudsons of No. 206 Squadron, 8 Hudsons of No. 224 Squadron and Blenheim fighters of No. 235 Squadron have been moved from East Coastto Aldergrove.8 Beauforts of No. 217 Squadron have been moved from St. Eval toLimavady.2 Stranraer flying boats of No. 240 Squadron and 2 Sunderland flying boats of No. 10 Squadron have been moved from Stranraer and Mount Battenrespectively to Loch Erne.3.   The above moves have increased the strength of Coastal Command\ aircraft in Northern Ireland from 56 to 96.4. The present Order of Battle of the Coastal Command, as directlyaffecting the North-Western Approaches problem, is shown on the attached map(Appendix A). The entries in red depict alterations in the location of units which have been made between the 28th February and the 10th March, 1941.\ 5. To enable Coastal Command to release aircraft from North Sea commit-ments to meet the above requirements, Bomber Command have moved Nos. 114and 107 (Blenheim) Squadrons to Thornaby and Leuchars. These Squadronshave taken over North Sea tasks previously undertaken by Coastal CommandSquadrons. As a matter of operational convenience, they have been placed underthe operational control of Coastal Command. Coastal Command have also made-additional dispositions on the East Coast.6. Coastal Command have continued their attacks on naval targets directlyconnected with the sea war, in particular on the Hipper Class cruiser at Brest.During the period under review they have dropped a total of 27-46 tons of bombs and sea mines on these operations.----- - v &apos;&apos;./-Bomber Command. ,7. Bomber Command have been given a new ^Directive, placing the mostimportant submarine building yards, diesel engine and submarine componentfactories, and the Focke Wulf factories and aerodromes, on first priority.   They
have also been instructed to continue their attacks on German Naval Units)particularly in the French west coast ports, as weather and opportunities(revealed by photographic reconnaissance) serve. During the fortnight ending the 8th&apos;/ 9th March, Bomber Command have dropped 273 - 5 tons of bombs and seamines on these objectives. A heavy attack on the Hipper Class cruiser at Brestis believed to have secured some hits and near misses. The cruiser has now been removed from the dry dock and is alongside a quay protected by torpedo nets.It is believed that this move may have resulted from fear of the risks of leaving:her in dry dock further exposed to heavy attacks, and it is possible that theintention is to move her about the harbour after dusk on each day that an air reconnaissance has been made.8. Exceptionally bad weather has seriously interfered with operationsthroughout the period under review. Many attacks have had to be cancelled orswitched to secondary objectives for this reason.Fighter Command.9.   In regard to paragraph 6 of the Directive of the Minister of Defence :  The C.O.S. (A.A.) Sub-Committee have investigated the redistribution of-relevant weapons as between the requirements for the defence of vital areas andthe Admiralty and have made the following recommendations for March whichare in process of being put into force :  The March programme for providing light A.A. weapons for ships is :  From production : 110 weapons.From A.D.G.B. : 40 weapons.A total of 45 weapons has already been handed over from production,leaving a further 65, which will be provided at the rate of 15 every three days.A.D.G.B. are providing 40 guns. These will all be handed over at the endof the month in accordance with the Admiralty rate of acceptance. Orders for moving 14 weapons have already been issued, and these orders are being implemented.10. In regard to paragraph 7 of the Directive of the Minister of Defence :  C.-in-C, Fighter Command, has made the following arrangements :  		Defences.						Increases Ordered.			Planned.

No decision to alter barrages yet taken,(c). Guns required to increase defences at West Coast ports now on the move.-
11. In addition, Fighter Command have arranged extra watch over theEast Coast convoys to replace that formerly provided by the Coastal command aircraft and a number of A.A. sloops now redisposed in protection of the NorthsWestern approaches.(i) Day.In general the fighter dispositions of the day Fighter Squadrons is adequate to meet the new Directive for the protection of shipping:A.O.C.-in-C, Fighter Command, has, however, taken the following action :-(a) One Squadron (Hurricanes) is moving to-day from Acklington toSpeke to increase the coverage in the Liverpool area.(b) Two Non-operational Squadrons at Pembrey and Filton are being brought up to strength in aircraft, and it is hoped to make themoperational by the 18th March. This will increase the day fighterprotection in the Bristol Channel area.(ii) Night.One Night Fighter Squadron (Beaufighters) hitherto based atCatterick, covering the approaches to the North Midlands, is being moved,one Flight to Prestwick, the other to Drem. The object is to provide nightprotection for the Forth-Clyde area. One section is already established at prestwick and one at Drem. The moves of the remainder of the Squadronwill take place as soon as the necessary administrative arrangements havebeen completed.General.12.   There are no serious difficulties to report.C. F. A. P.March 12, 1941.ANNEX III.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.WE submit the following report on the action taken to implement theinstructions contained in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Prime Ministers Directiveof the 6th March.A.A. Defence of West Coast Ports.2. The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Fighter Command, hasredisposed Fighter units to meet the requirements of the Prime MinistersDirective. In addition, he has withdrawn from existing resources 58 H.A.A.guns with which to reinforce the defences of the Mersey, Clyde and bristol channel, and an additional 23 HA.A. guns have been allocated to these areas from March production. The details of this deployment are set out in theProgress Report by the Chief of the Air Staff, dated the 12th March, which hasalready been submitted to the Prime Minister.Short Range Guns.3. A plan has been prepared whereby 150 Bofors and crews are to be madeavailable for the Admiralty from production and A.D.G.B. in such a way as toensure that the delivery of the guns will meet the Admiralty&apos;s acceptance Time-table of 5 guns per day. Sixty of these weapons have already been delivered.It is proposed to work out details for the provision of this further 150 guns in stages, in order that the plan may be properly related to the rate of fitting andthe delivery of guns from production. The provision of crews for these guns ona permanent basis, as opposed to temporary loan from A.D.G.B., is now under examination.In addition, arrangements are being made for the return of 106 Naval2-pdr. Mk. VIII gun barrels at the rate of 25 per month, beginning on aboutthe 1st April.
UP. Weapons.4. There is a large Admiralty programme of 2-ins. multi-barrel (14 barrels)U.P. weapons now being implemented. The first 50 equipments are expected intwo weeks&apos; time, and the total order of 1,050 equipments should be completed in three months&apos; time. Improved models are on order. In addition, the possibilityof employing the 3-ins. land service single barrel projector is under examination.P.A.C.5. Arrangements have been made to provide 250 gunpowder rocketprojectors per week with the necessary ammunition for installation in ships. Tomeet the Admiralty&apos;s request for additional equipment, action has been takento increase the present rate of production of gunpowder rockets, as an interim measure, as much as practicable.In addition, the Admiralty are to be provided with their quota of theappropriate form of cordite P.AC.(Signed) C.
