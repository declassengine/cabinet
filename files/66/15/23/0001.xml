naval SITUATION.General Review.A successful raid on the fish oil plants in the Lofoten Islands has beencarried out.An Italian 6-inch cruiser is reported to have been sunk.Shipping casualties have been heavy.There is no fresh news of enemy raiders.Northern Waters.2. A raid on the Lofoten Islands was successfully carried out on the4th March by units of the Home Fleet with special service and Norwegian troops.During this operation our forces destroyed the German whale factory shipHamburg (9,780 tons) and ten smaller ships making a total of 18,000 tons. Over300 Norwegian volunteers were embarked, including eight women. three hundred and eighty prisoners were taken, of whom 198 belonged to the GermanNavy, Army and Air Force, 172 were civilians or merchant seamen and ten were&quot; Quislings.&quot;One German Naval officer and six ratings were killed in the fighting, our forces suffered no casualties or damage. The landing parties reported that their reception ashore was most friendly.Home Waters.3. The 9th Canadian Troop convoy arrived safely in the Clyde p.m. 27th.H.M.S. Resolution (torpedoed off Dakar last September) arrived at Portsmouth,and H.M. Destroyers Newark and Wells (ex United States) have arrived fromHalifax.Heavy weather was experienced in the earlier part of the week. H.M.Submarine Taku was disabled in the North-Western Approaches and is now into. H.M. Destroyer Georgetown and H.M. Minesweeper Kellet were bothdamaged in collisions.Five destroyers carried out a sweep to intercept an enemy tanker and other small ships reported by air reconnaissance off Ushant p.m. the 3rd March, but did not locate them.Shipping in Lerwick Harbour was unsuccessfully bombed on the 2nd Marchby one enemy aircraft, and Kirkabister Lighthouse was machine-gunned.Mediterranean.4. As reported in last week&apos;s Resume, Kasteloritzo Island was occupied atdawn on the 25th. Units were landed from H.M. Destroyers Decoy and Herewardwith only slight opposition. HM. Gunboat Ladybird entered the harbour anda party of Royal Marines was landed in the town. Ladybird was slightly damaged in a heavy raid by enemy aircraft and forced to withdraw. Two enemyE-Boats attacked the island during the night of the 25th/26th. H.M. DestroyerJaguar located a ship in the Inner Harbour and fired torpedoes, four explosionsbeing heard. Later Jaguar engaged an enemy destroyer and hit her twice, butthe enemy made her escape. During the night of the 27th/28th our forces were withdrawn due to heavy air attacks and the landing of enemy reinforcements.H.M. Submarine Upright reported that on the 25th when off the coast of tunis she sighted three enemy warships and torpedoed a 6-inch cruiser of theCondottieri &quot; A &quot; Class (5,000 tons, 8 6-inch guns), which is believed sunk.Two days later Upright successfully attacked a darkened and unescorted ship inthe same area.   The ship burst into flames and probably sank.
Enemy Intelligence.German.7.   The Hipper class cruiser has been at Brest throughout the week.Italian.8. There has been little information reported by reconnaissance of ItalianNaval ports except from the Tripoli area where considerable concentrations ofshipping have been seen. The latest photograph of the harbour taken on the4th March showed three destroyers, one fleet auxiliary of 10,000 tons, threemerchant ships of 8,000 tons, one of 7,000 tons, two tankers of 8,000 tons, fourmerchant ships of from 3/5,000 tons and a large number of small craft. Onemerchant ship of 6,000 tons was at anchor outside the harbour. The fact thatTripoli is the only North African port left to the Italians is no doubt in part the explanation of this heavy traffic.Balkan States.9. The Naval forces of the Balkan States recently occupied by germany are as follows  Roumania.Four destroyers of which two date from 1917-18 and two from 1930. Onemodern submarine, three new M.T.B.&apos;s, a submarine depot ship, four old gunboats and two new minelayers. In addition to these there are seven old rivermonitors.Bulgaria.Two new M.T.B &apos;s, six old patrol vessels and two minesweepers.[22295] BH.M. Destroyer Firedrake grounded on the Spanish coast, 40 miles west of gibraltar in thick fog on the 1st March. She was refloated and returned to gibraltar under her own steam.During the week seven French merchant ships passed Gibraltar westboundand four eastbound under escort.Indian Ocean and South Africa.5. On the 4th March, H.M.A.S. Australia and BZ.M.S. Leander (NewZealand Squadron) when about 300 miles south-east of the Seychelles interceptedthe German s.s. Coburg (7,400 tons), which had left Massawa on the 21st February,and the Norwegian tanker Ketty Brovig (7,031 tons) probably captured by apocket battleship on the 2nd February. The former was suspected of being an armed raider and was engaged, set on fire and sunk; and the latter scuttledherself.The French s.s. Ville de Majunga (2,972 tons) Marseilles to Madagascarwith 600 demobilised troops and the s.s. Ville de Strasbourg (7,138 tons) havebeen intercepted and sent to Simonstown and Durban respectively.Anti-Subniarine Operations.6. In the North-Western Approaches six attacks have been made onU-Boats, two by aircraft and four by surface craft, but with no definite results.The s.s. Merchant in a homeward-bound convoy narrowly missed ramminga U-Boat and fired 60 rounds from her machine gun into the conning tower andhull.On the 1st March a Blenheim sank a U-Boat at Massawa and F.A.A. air-craft from H.M.S. Formidable bombed a small floating dock which was thought to contain a U-Boat.A U-Boat was attacked by aircraft off Cape Spartel on the 3rd March, but no bombs were seen to hit.
Ice Conditions.10: The approaches to the Baltic are still all frozen up and off the south coast of Norway and in the Skagerrak the ice situation is rather worse. Thesituation at the German ports remains as last reported, but Dutch ports exceptDelfziji on the Ems are probably normal by now.U-Boats.11. The enemy has maintained 12-14 German U-Boats and three Italiansin the North-West Approaches throughout the week. There has been a Germanto the south-west of the Canaries probably bound for the Freetown area, and earlier in the week possibly a patrol off the entrance to the English Channel.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.12. Twenty-five ships and two small craft, a total of 127,257 tons have beenreported lost by enemy action, of these fifteen ships and two small craft (76,307tons) were British. Six British ships (36,520 tons) and three allied ships (15,924tons) were sunk by U-Boats in the North-Western Approaches, seven British(27,719 tons) and seven Allied (35,026 tons) by aircraft and two British and two small craft (2,068 tons) by mines. Eighteen ships, thirteen of which are British,are reported damaged, three by U-Boat attack and the remainder by aircraft.In addition to the above totals, six ships (35,368 tons), of which four ships(12,588 tons) were British, are shown in Appendix I as sunk during 1939 and1940 by surface raider or cause unknown.13. No concentrated attack on a convoy has taken place since that on the26th./27th reported in last week&apos;s Resume. Ten ships of this convoy have nowbeen reported sunk. A Focke Wulf aircraft sighted a convoy on the 4th in theNorth-Western Approaches, but flew off when attacked by our escorting aircraft.Shipping has been attacked on two days in the St. George&apos;s Channel, two shipsbeing sunk and one damaged. East Coast convoys were attacked on four days,one ship being sunk off the Shipwash and two ships damaged off Kinnairds Head.Enemy torpedo boats and E-Boats were operating off Lowestoft on the night ofthe 4th/5th, but no contact was made owing to foggy weather.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ending noon, Wednesday, the 5th March, 746 ships,including 152 allied and 15 neutral were convoyed, of which three are knownto have been lost by enemy action. Since the start of the war 245 ships havebeen lost in convoy or one ship in every 226. Two battleships, six cruisers, elevenarmed merchant cruisers, sixty destroyers, 32 sloops and corvettes and three submarines were employed on escort duty.15. Imports to Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the 1st March totalled 571,819 tons, compared with 931,443 tons during theprevious seven days. Oil imports amounted to 154,100 tons in 16 tankers.Mineral imports were 174,374 tons, of which 124,144 tons were iron ore, scrapiron, pig iron and steel. Timber and pulp imports were 49,919 tons, and cereal imports were 128,747 tons. Other food imports were 25,347 tons, of which 11,654tons were sugar and 1,472 were fruit. Imports of machinery, ammunition and aircraft were again satisfactory.British Minelaying.16. H.M.S. Plover laid 120 mines in St. George&apos;s Channel on the night ofthe 26th/27th February, and there has been a little minelaying by aircraft offthe North-West Coast of Germany during the week. H.M. Submarine Cachalotlaid 50 mines off the Norwegian Coast.
Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.17. During the period under review enemy minelaying from aircraft tookplace off the East Coast, north of the Humber, in the Thames Estuary, offFalmouth and in the Bristol Channel. Forty magnetic or acoustic mines weredetonated during the week, twelve of which were in the Humber and nine offSwansea.Foreign Waters.18. On the 28th February German aircraft laid mines in the Grand andMarsamuscetto Harbours, Malta, some of which have since exploded spontaneously.It was intended to reopen the Suez Canal on the 3rd March, but on that day,nine mines were dropped between Lake Timsah and Port Said during very heavyrain showers. The buoyed Channel to Port Said is also closed due to enemyminelaying.   Tobruk Harbour is reported clear of mines.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.19. The s.s. Regensburg (8,069 tons), which had sailed from Yokohama onthe 20th December last, arrived back there on the 2nd March.The s.s. Lech (3,290 tons) arrived at Rio de Janeiro on the 3rd March, fullyloaded and also carrying three aircraft in cases on deck. The master is reportedto have said that he left Bordeaux on the 1st February.The tanker Rudolf Albrecht (3,817 tons), is reported from Teneriffe to befitting out as a supply and prison ship for raiders and is expected to be ready tosail by the 5th March.Italian Merchant Shipping.. 20. The Italian press has acknowledged the sinking of five troop transportsbetween November and February in the Mediterranean.Italian prisoners of war have confirmed the sinking of the Snia Amba(2,532 tons), the Liguria (15,354 tons), and have added the Serenitas (5,171 tons).The first of these was sunk outside Benghazi, the other two at Tobruk.MILITARY SITUATION.Germany.German troops on Franco-Spanish Frontier.21. Two reports dated the 2nd March, from independent sources G^einknownrr^lia&amp;iiityy suggest that there has been a fresh influx of German troops in the areaBayonne-Hendaye, and one of them mentions increased infiltration of germans in mufti into Northern Spain.German Infiltration in French Morocco.22. By the middle of February the German Armistice Commission in Casa-blanca numbered 52 officers and N.C,0&apos;s. and one civilian. A reliable source nowputs the total at 80.German Troops in Italy and North Africa.23. It is still impossible to obtain definite evidence as to German troopspassing through Italy. The most recent report -(roliabi4i-ty^unknown)- states thatone German armoured division and one motorised division were in Sicily on the15th February, and that elements of these formations were in Libya on the3rd March.   The strength of these detachments is as yet unknown.
Allowing for Italian reinforcements, and judging by the amount of shipping-reaching Tripoli, it seems unlikely that more than one German division can yethave landed in Libya.German Move into Bulgaria.24. The anticipated German move into Bulgaria has now begun, and it isstated -by-a-souree-described-as^reliabie that the eventual strength will be20 divisions (including four armoured and three motorised). Another -sfftrrceTputsthe projected total at 16. The advanced guards of German motorised divisions are said to have been seen on the 2nd March to the south of Plovdiv and alsomoving from Burgas towards Elkhovo. The presence of German troops in the struma Valley is also reported. These are probably advanced parties, the mainbodies would advance more slowly, especially as mud and snow are said to beinterfering with movement.Italy.25. It is estimated that there are now 600,000 men under arms, includingcorps and army troops. Of these, the latest joined conscript class is estimatedat about 220,000. The condition of the Italian Army can only be described asindifferent.Balkan States.A albania.26. The garrison has now reached a total of 24 divisions of all types andany wastage of personnel is made up by a steady flow of reinforcements acrossthe Adriatic. There are no indications that any offensive is contemplated in theimmediate future.Turkey.27. Coincident with the entry of German troops into Bulgaria, Turkey hastaken certain precautionary measures. The number of troops in Thrace is being raised from 14 divisions to 19 divisions.Bulgaria.28. Sixteen of Bulgaria&apos;s seventeen divisions are now reported to havemobilised. The complete Order of Battle is not known, but the largest concentra-tions appear to be in the Lyubimets-Svilengrad sector of the Turkish frontier,i.e., near the point where the Greek and Turkish frontiers meet.Africa.Libya.29. The Italian garrison of Tripolitania has not been engaged in any recent operations. Reinforcements to the extent of two infantry divisions and someartillery have reached Tripoli. The present weakness of the garrison lies in the lack of artillery, which was withdrawn fromi formations for the operations in.eastern Libya.Strategical reconnaissance has shown the disposition of numbers of enemyM.T. in various places between our advanced units and Tripoli.Enemy aircraft have attacked our forward troops on several occasions, theresult being a few wounded and a small amount of damage to armoured car sand trucks.Eritrea.30. On the 25th February our forces came in touch with the enemy aboutMescelit (15 miles North-East of Keren). The village was subsequently capturedon the 1st March.
A abyssinia.31. On the 26th February in the Blue Nile Sector three of our platoonsencountered the enemy East of Afodu. The enemy lost 17 killed. Our casualties were 1 killed and 5 wounded.On the 27th February in the Gojjam area patriots inflicted considerablelosses on the enemy garrison of Burye (70 miles South of Lake Tana), who wereattempting a sortie.   Guerilla operations in this area continue satisfactorily.Italian Somaliland.32. In the forward area about Mogadishu considerable quantities of storeshave been captured and sufficient food is available for the civil population.Our patrols advancing to Isha Baidoa captured 200 prisoners, a considerableamount of transport and 20,000 gallons of petrol. The total number of prisonersnew exceeds 10,000Far East.Thailand-Indo-China dispute.33. The Vichy Government has refused to accept some conditions of. thesettlement. The Japanese have now stated that these may have to be imposed by force.Japanese munitions continue to arrive in Thailand, at least one shipmentas a result of orders placed since the armistice.Convoys.34. The following troops were among those which arrived at Suez on the3rd March : H.Q. 9th Australian Division.One Australian Infantry Brigade.One New Zealand Infantry Brigade (4 Battalions).One New Zealand Battalion.One New Zealand M.G. Battalion.One Army Field Regiment R.A.Drafts and Base and L. of C. Units.AIR SITUATION.General Review.35. Aircraft of Bomber Command have heavily attacked Cologne,Wilhelmshaven and Brest. Our bombers and fighters have actively supportedoperations against the Italians in East Africa and Abyssinia, and in Albaniaour fighters have shown a marked superiority over the enemy.36. German aircraft bombed Cardiff on two nights, and a heavy attack was delivered on Hal Far aerodrome at Malta.&apos;&quot; 37. Operational aircraft battle casualties and extracts from recent RaidAssessment Reports are given in Appendices VI and VII.United Kingdom.38. Fighter Command flew 625 patrols involving 2,029 sorties by day and267 patrols involving 423 sorties at dusk and by night, which is comparable withthe previous week. Every effort was made to intercept enemy reconnaissance and bomber aircraft during daylight and a number were destroyed or damaged,but cloud cover generally favoured the raiders. On the 4th March our fighterscarried out two sweeps over the Channel without encountering any enemy air-craft ; on two other days operations were extended over Northern France.39.   Daylight operations by enemy long-range bombers were generally on avery small scale, although more attention was paid to shipping.    On the27th February, however, advantage was taken of an unbroken layer of low cloudto increase the scale of attack and about eighty bombers were reported to be[22295] c
operating; attacks were made on a,number of East Anglianjgrodromes without causing any appreciable damage, on/Parnall\ Aircraft Factory^ and on shipping.Fighter patrols were maintained in the Straits, but only on one day were offensive patrols made over East Kent and these were on a small scale.40. Night operations by enemy bombers took place on three nights. On thefirst of these, attacks were widespread with no obvious objective, and on two other successive nights the main target was Cardiff. A number of enemy aircraft were sighted by our night fighters and on the night 4th/5th March one was destroyed and four others were shot down by AA. fire. Minelaying on a moderate scale was also carried out on these nights chiefly off the North-east coast of England and the Thames Estuary. A total of about 440 night bombersoperated against this country during the week, including those suspected ofminelaying.Germany and Occupied Territory.41. During the week Bomber Command flew 18 sorties by day and 413 by night.Day.42. Blenheims carried out a day attack on the hotel at Quiberon nearLorient, where submarine crews were billeted; three direct hits were scored froma height of fifty feet. The docks at Den Helder and the petrol storage at Flushingwere also attacked. Beauforts of Coastal Command carried out successful attacks on aerodromes at Borkum and Haamstede.43. On the 5th March offensive operations were undertaken over northern france in which sixteen fighter squadrons participated, some of which escortedsix Blenheims in an attack on Boulogne Harbour. The bombing was succesful and our fighters destroyed one Me. 109 and probably destroyed six others; welost four Spitfires. Another offensive sweep by twelve Hurricanes from Etaplesto Dunkirk resulted in three enemy fighters being destroyed without loss to ourselves.Night.44.- Night bombing operations were undertaken on four nights. Two furtherconcentrated attacks were made on the industrial areas of Cologne in addition tothe one reported last week. In all 120 tons of H.E. bombs, including 28 of1,000 lbs. each, and 25,000 incendiary bombs, were dropped. The last pilot toattack during the first raid reported the town to be a raging inferno, and afterthe subsequent attack a fire extending for three-quarters of a mile was observed.45. On another night 72 bombers concentrated their attack on the naval base at Wilhelmshaven, including the Bauhafen area. A number of 2,000-lb.bombs were dropped and many bursts were observed but conditions were not generally favourable and the Tirpitz was not identified.46. The Hipper Class cruiser at Brest was attacked on two nights duringthe week. On the first occasion only a small force of bombers took part, but oil the second attack 43 aircraft were employed. During this attack some pilotscame down as low as 1,500 feet and believe the cruiser must &quot;have been hit; a largewhite explosion was observed 60 miles from the target. A Stirling is missing fromone of these attacks. Emden, Boulogne, Rotterdam, Ostend and Calais, and anumber of aerodromes in occupied territory, were also bombed..47. Blenheims from Fighter Command carried out a number of harassingattacks on aerodromes in Northern France. Flare paths were bombed; a He. Illshot down at Merville; and another bomber probably destroyed while about toland near Lille.Coastal Reconnaissance, Patrols and Minelaying.48. Aircraft of Coastal Command flew 202 routine, special and offensive patrols and photographic reconnaissances involving 288 sorties. Three hundredand sixty-two additional sorties were made in protection of Convoys, to whichFighter Command contributed a further 304.
49. Several enemy merchant vessels were attacked. A direct hit with a torpedo was registered on a 2,000 ton vessel near Horns Reef, and near misseswere made with two bombs on a similar sized vessel near Utyoer Light. Severalaircraft escorting convoys were successful in driving off enemy attackers. ASunderland 90 miles West of Slyne Head shot down one Ju. 88 and probably destroyed another, while Blenheims on other occasions seriously damaged aHe. Ill and a Ju. 88. A Spitfire took photographs from a low height of the&quot;Hipper &quot; Cruiser at Brest, and shot down a Me. 109 as it was taking off to intercept.50. Enemy minelayers were more active than during the previous week,about 105 aircraft being so engaged. Attacks on our shipping were again carriedout, principally by aircraft operating from Bordeaux.Greece and Albania.51. Our bomber and fighter aircraft operating from Greece have displayedconsiderable activity during the week, and our Hurricane squadron has shown amarked superiority over the enemy on every occasion.52. Blenheim bombers, escorted by Elurricane and Gladiator fighters, havegiven strong support to the Greek ground forces, especially in the Tepelene area.On one occasion nineteen Gladiators and nine Hurricanes intercepted aboutfifty Italian bombers and fighters, of which they destroyed nineteen and probably destroyed a further nine, damaging others.53. Two heavy attacks by Blenheims were made on military objectives andthe aerodrome at Berat. Stores and aerodrome buildings were put on fire andtwo aircraft destroyed and others damaged. Fier (20 miles W. of Berat) was also attacked and the Italian G.H.Q. machine-gunned. A single Hurricane of theescorting force, delayed in taking off, engaged five C.R. 42&apos;s, three of which hedestroyed before his ammunition was expended.54. On two occasions nine Blenheims, escorted by nine Hurricanes, success-fully attacked Valona aerodrome and military objectives. During one engage-ment the Elurricanes destroyed seven C.R. 42&apos;s, while two others collided in theair. On another occasion Hurricanes intercepted ten Cant 1007&apos;s returning from a raid on Larissa and destroyed five of them. Duing all these engagementsour losses were one Gladiator, from which the pilot was saved.55. On the 4th March fourteen Blenheims accompanied by Hurricanes andGladiators attacked six Italian warships south of Valona. No direct hits were claimed, but bombs burst around the ships. Italian fighters in the vicinity were engaged and nine shot down and a further two probably destroyed. Two of ourHurricanes were missing.Malta.56. On several occasions formations of enemy aircraft approached the island, without attacking. At dawn on the 28th February ten aircraft droppedparachute mines in and off the harbours; two exploded in Valetta causing con-siderable damage to property and some casualties. On another occasion sixJu. 88&apos;s dropped bombs in the North-Eastern and Southern Coasts of the island, but no serious damage resulted.57. On the 5th March approximately 100 enemy aircraft attacked Hal Farand Kalafrana; the damage at the latter place was not serious. At Hal Far,however, two barrack blocks were demolished, hangars were considerably damaged,four aircraft burnt out and all other a4yeija^-irnel-ud4^ag-the aerodrome renderedtemporarily unserviceable. Eleven of our fighters engaged the enemy and destroyed seven and probably destroyed another; nine others were shot down byA.A. fire, while it is considered probable that others did not reach their base.One of our Hurricanes is missing.Egypt and Libya.58. Our activity has been on a reduced scale. Reconnaissances have beencarried out along the Libyan coast, and Hurricanes of the R.A.A.F. have main-tamed fighter patrols over Benghazi, Agedabia and El Agheila.    Jedabya
*(90 miles S. of Benghazi) was twice attacked by .T.U. 87&apos;s and M.E. 110&apos;s without causing any serious damage. One J.U. 88 was destroyed over Benghazi. Fiveenemy aircraft dropped mines in the Suez Canal, three of which exploded on thebank.Italian East Africa.59. In Eritrea the operations of our Air Force have continued mainly insupport of our land forces in the Keren area. In an effort to isolate the enemydefences, transport, stores and troops were attacked in the Asmara area as wellas the railway to Massawa. The submarine base at Massawa was bombed andhits scored on the jetty; and a submarine was sunk by a Blenheim near DahlakIsland. Aerodromes at Zula and Makale were also bombed and machine-gunnedand several enemy aircraft were destroyed. Attacks were also made on the ports of Raheita and Massawa.60. Support has been given to the Emperor&apos;s column advancing on theCapital by two raids on Burye, where hits were obtained on the forts. In theSouthern sector transport and ground positions at Javello and Neghelli have been bombed several times.61. In Italian Somaliland extensive reconnaissances have been flown along the coast and up the road from Mogadishu running north into the interior.Bombing has been concentrated on communications and supplies at the maincentres along the Western road into Abyssinia.Air Intelligence.Italy.-62. German Industrialists now in Italy are reported to be unfavourablyimpressed by the standard and effort of the Italian aircraft industry. There arealso reliable reports of recent arrests for sabotage by the introduction of carbohydrates-rundum into the cylinders of finished Aircraft Engines.63. Reports continue to indicate the existence of bad feeling between theItalian and German Air Forces, especially in Sicily, where General Pricolo&apos;message of welcome to the Germans was not even acknowledged. The Italians are reported to have been jubilant when six German Heinkels which set out for a raid on the Suez Canal Zone all failed to return except one, which crashed onlanding.  The Germans blamed the Italians for their faulty signals organization.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.64. Enemy activity has been on a small scale except on the 27th February,when there was widespread bombing in East Anglia and many aerodromes there and in the South and West were attacked.By Night.65.   Except for raids on Cardiff on the nights of the 3rd/4th and the4th/5th, when Penarth was also raided, bombing has been mostly of a minor    ^character, scattered over the North-East, East, South and South-West of thecountry.Damage.Cardiff and Penarth.66. Residential property, churches and public buildings suffered mostseverely. The docks were not seriously damaged. Railway services were temporarily dislocated.
Elsewhere.67.   Thirteen RAP. aerodromes have been hit during the week.The Parnall Aircraft Works at Yate, Bristol, were hit on the 27th february and considerable damage was done to buildings. Full production will be restored in about a month&apos;s time.The substation of Sunder]and Corporation Electricity Power Station was destroyed on the night of the 3rd/4th February.   &apos;Casualties.68. For the week ending 0600 the 5th March it is estimated that 176 people were killed and 297 injured. Of these, 56 were killed and 115 injured at Cardiffand 51 killed and 50 injured at Yate.[22295]D
