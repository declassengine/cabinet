VEDETTE by an italian submarine which was within Spanish territorial waters, the WarCabinet on the 15th June gave authority for British Warships to returnattacks delivered from Spanish territorial waters by enemy submarines.      I now ask for authority to permit.H.M. Ships which have attacked an enemy submarine to enter the territorial waters of Spanish Morocco, Tangier andthe Canary Islands, and continue the attack should the submarine attemptto escape by taking refuge there.2.      Two Italian submarines were attacked by our destroyers on the 3rdand 4th November and on both occasions the submarines took refuge inTangier harbour.     Despite the representations made by H.M. ambassador at Madrid, the submarines were allowed to remain at Tangier.for six weeks and then left the port at the time ?/hen they had just been given a further three weeks&apos; extension of time on the grounds that they were still notseaworthy.     In June last year the Spanish Government showed the samelaxity in dealing with an Italian Submarine, in this case allowing thesubmarine, which was interned after taking refuge at Ceuta, to escape from internment.     More recently an Italian submarine put into Las Palmas for repairs, and although the Spanish Government granted eight days for therepairs to be made, in fact, the submarine was able to leave at the end of four days.3.     It is clear.., therefore, that the Spanish Government to not intend to apply against enemy submarines the generally accepted principles ofinternational law governing the stay of belligerent warships in neutral ports and we may therefore be faced with a situation in which enemy submarinesoperating in, or passing through, the Straits of Gibraltar, or operatingoff the Canaries, seek sanctuary in Spanish territorial waters when attacked and remain in a Spanish port on the excuse of unseaworthiness until a/suitable.......
suitable opportunity occurs for evading the British Patrols.     To avoid this&quot;situation, I ask,: for authority, for the Navy to continue the chase^intoterritorial waters;    the instructions would not allow of the attack being continued after the submarine had entered a Spanish port, nor would they apply to the territorial.,waters of Metropolitan Spain or the Balearics.     Bylimiting action to the Spanish Zone of Morocco the Canaries and Tangier, itis considered that less serious offence will be caused to the SpanishGovernment.4.      It is not proposed to inform the Spanish Government in advance ofthe action proposed, but when an incident has occurred it is intended todefend our action on the grounds that it is clear that the enemy have everyintention of abusing Spanish territorial waters, and that we cannot allow the activities of our warships to be nullified by enemy submarines escapinginto Spanish territorial waters where, our experience has shown, they willbe given far more liberal treatment than that which they should receiveunder the generally accepted principles of international lav/.&quot;5.      I attach a copy of the instructions which I propose to issue to. theNaval Authorities concerned;    no action will be taken to issue these instructions until the present negotiations with the Spanish government over Tangier have been completed.A V A-Admiralty, S.Y.r.l*February, 17,   1941.
BJR.To   C in C., Med.F.0.i/c., North Atlantic.(R)   G. in C., South Atlantic.Admiral (S).From Admiralty,H.M. Ships in contact with submarine which attempts to escape by entering territorial waters of Spanish Morocco, Tangieror the Canary Islands, may enter these territorial waters and continue attack, care being taken that lives and property on shoreare not endangered.       If, whiles- inside Spanish territorial waters,contact is lost, hunt may be continued for one hour but at end ofthis period, unless contact is regained, H.M.Ships should leaveterritorial waters.     Attack must not repeat no^&quot;be continued aftersubmarine has aotually entered port of Tangier or port in spanish morocco or Canary Islands.     Attacks must not repeat not be made in territorial waters of Metropolitan Spain or of other Spanish territoryoutside Spanish Morocco, Canary Islands and Tangier except whenenemy submarine delivers attack on H.M.
