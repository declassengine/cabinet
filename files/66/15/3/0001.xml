PORTAL.R. H. HAINING (V.C.I.G.S.).Great George Street, S.W. 1,February 12, 1941.A.-FRENCH.(i) Navy.Free French Naval Forces.General Situation. The de Gaulle movement seems to be at a critical stage of its existence, and this applies very much to the Free French Navy. Therehave been many desertions and Free French sailors continually apply to join theRoyal Navy, but are not allowed to do so. The fact is that part of the Free french navy is quite good and part quite bad. In order to save the whole it will be most desirable for the Admiralty to concert with the French whatever special measures are suitable to the occasion. The matter is under discussion in theCommittee on Foreign (Allied) Resistance, which will shortly communicate withthe Admiralty.In the meanwhile, adverse reports on ships and men of the Free French Navyare frankly discussed with Admiral Muselier, who shows every desire to putthings right.2. Plymouth. Morale and discipline are still not up to standard, butimproving. The Commanding Officers of the Bouclier and La Melpomene haveexpressed the hope that the foundering of the Branlebas will not affect theemployment of their ships as fighting units.Refit of Submarine Surcouf is now completed and she will be ready to sailearly in February..   [22211] B
A report received from Captain (S), 2nd Submarine Flotilla, dealing withthe Escort Vessel La Moqueuse says that discipline is very slack and that adefeatist attitude exists. The reporting officer seems confident, howrever, that thiswill be overcome when discipline is tightened up and the French Officers havemixed with ours.The discipline of the submarine Junon&apos;s crew has not been satisfactory, but some of the more irresponsible elements have been removed and improvement isexpected to follow.Arrangements are nearly complete for the transfer from the Polish Navy tothe F.N.F.L. of the 2 &quot; Chasseurs 11 and 15&quot; now at Dartmouth, and whenmanned by French crews they will join the Portsmouth Command.The eight French Cadets who joined the R.N. College, Dartmouth, for a two-term course are well reported on.The Bouclier, lately manned by the Poles, has now been manned by theFrench.3. Portsmouth. Morale excellent and the men much heartened by oursuccesses against the Italians.The Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, has paid special tribute to the readiness of French seamen to help during air raids, particularly noticeableduring and after the heavy air raid of the 10th January.Discipline is generally good, but comment is made that a certain number ofofficers promoted from the Lower Deck are not of the type to enforce a high-standard. Unfortunately and inevitably, Admiral Muselier&apos;s choice of selectionis very restricted.The men in the Chasseurs are developing an esprit de corps of their own andlook upon themselves as one of the most active units of the F.N.F.L.At the same time there seems to have been some complaint that crews ofBritish-manned Chasseurs receive hard-lying money whereas the French do not.The old French battleship Courbet, depot ship, includes the less desirableelements of the force and till now has been its weakest link. If she could be paidoff and the depot transferred to a short establishment many skilled ratings nowretained to maintain machinery could be sent to seagoing ships. Unfortunately,it seems impossible to find a suitable building.However, the Commander-in-Chief reports that &apos;&apos; A great change has taken place since the appointment of a goodCaptain to the Courbet and a good officer in command of the Chasseurs.Between our men and the French there will probably never be a very cordialrelationship because the national temperaments are so entirely different, butI arn told that the French sailors and British sailors get on very well togethernow. Our ideas of cleanliness and sanitation are, for instance, entirely different from theirs, as can be easily seen by the washing and heads arrange-ment in a French ship.&quot; Captain Gayral of the Courbet has effected a big all-round improve-ment, and he has asked to land his own patrol in order to keep his libertymen up to the mark.&quot;4. The IS!ore. The Minesweeper Congre was paid off and her French crewreturned to Courbet.5. Rosyth. Morale and discipline of submarine crew at Dundee remainsatisfactory.The submarine Minerve is now manned by an entirely French crew andalthough the majority of the officers and men were previously untrained insubmarines they have shown great keenness and aptitude and have quicklyreached a satisfactory standard of efficiency.The Minerve is now due to join this base.Frenchmen in the Royal Navy.6.   Morale and discipline remain satisfactory.Portsmouth. Morale and discipline good. Pleasure is expressed overparticipation of Free French Forces in North Africa. Hope is entertained thatGeneral Weygand will join the cause, but Admiral Darlan is mistrusted.
7. The Nore. Morale and discipline are reported up to R.N. standard, butmen are not making much progress in the language. This matter is beingenquired into.(ii) Army.Free French Forces.8.   Strength.

No adverse criticism has appeared : &apos;&apos; A number of soldiers and sailors wounded at Dunkirk have beenrepatriated. The majority report that they were well treated and well tendedin England.&quot;&quot; My cousin Eugene, who was at Cherbourg, left with the English fromLiverpool. He has very pleasant memories; it appears they were very kind to him.  If he had not a family here he would have stayed in England.&quot;&quot; If we have any advice to give you, it is not to leave (England). I wasspeaking to Michel Maze of St. Pierre, who has come from there. Well, hewould give a lot to be back again, and nearly all those who have come back from England say the same.&quot;Letters from French Personnel include the following extracts : .&quot; It saddens me to think I am the only one in my family to join theFree French Navy.....   The day will come beware those who betrayedus officers, cowards, commanders of ships, Generals, superior officers, andthe so-called politicians -beware.   They have let us down.&quot;&apos;&apos; I am very content in the Free French Forces and am waiting patientlyfor the day of victory, when we can go back to our beloved country and ourparents, who have had no news of us.&quot;&quot; Believe me, I am very proud of our &apos; Force,&apos; and victory will be thebest present we have ever had in our lives.&quot; ....The lavish entertainment provided for the ship while at Greenock was muchappreciated : &apos;&apos; Here (in Scotland) we are made a great fuss of, as are all the followersof General de Gaulle. We are invited out and feted, but we did not join upto stop here. We must fight to save France.&quot;&quot;It is sad getting no letters. I wish to become acquainted with theEnglish.&quot;Writing from the Free French Depot Ship, an Officer recounts difficultiesencountered in keeping discipline : :&apos;&apos; Since arriving here I have not been pleased, and there is no harmonyamongst us Frenchmen, particularly among these Bretons, who are drunkfrom morning till night. On my first day of service I had to sock a sailor onthe jaw.  I am obliged to use my fists to make myself obeyed.&quot;
