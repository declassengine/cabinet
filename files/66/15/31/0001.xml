NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.The battle-cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau have been sighted to thesouth-west of the Canaries.E-Boat activity has increased on tihe East Coast.The Suez Canal was cleared sufficiently to allow the passage of essentialtraffic, but was later closed again.Shipping losses reported have been heavy.Two U-boats have been sunk and their crews captured.Home Waters.2. During the week sweeps were carried out by M.T.B.&apos;s off the Dutch coast and by destroyers off the south Cornish coast and to the west of Brest, but no enemyunits were encountered.On the evening of the 12th one of our Beaufort aircraft torpedoed an enemydestroyer in the Skagerrak, causing a large explosion.During the air attack on Portsmouth on the night of the 10th/11th H.M.Destroyers Withering ton and Tynedale were damaged and the former had to bebeached. A minesweeping trawler was sunk and several were damaged.H.M.S. Victory sustained slight damage from a small bomb under the fore foot.Naval casualties were 87 killed, 224 seriously wounded and 168 slightly wounded.The damage to shore establishments is reported in the Home Security Section ofthis resume.Mediterranean.3.. H.M. Submarine Ursula torpedoed a 10,000-ton transport off Tripoli onthe 22nd February and when last seen the ship was sinking and her decks wereawash.   Ursula was heavily counter-attacked but was not damaged.During air attacks on Malta H.M. Destroyer Imperial and the transportEssex, both under repair, were slightly damaged on the 7th March; on the10th March severe damage was caused in the dockyard, which will affect produc-tion, and on the night of the 11th/12th the torpedo depot at Misida was hit.During the period under review 5 Vichy French ships (20,732 tons) have passed Gibraltar westbound and 11 (31,774 tons) have passed eastbound underescort.South Atlantic.4. On the afternoon of the 8th March, when 500 miles S.W. of the Canaries,H.M.S. Malaya, escorting a homeward-bound convoy from Sierra Leone, sighteda battle-cruiser 40 miles to the westward. Her aircraft later reported 2 ships which retired to the south-west.Malaya confirmed these as the battle-cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau andthen rejoined her convoy. Nothing further was seen of the enemy, but thissighting has necessitated considerable redisposition of our naval forces.Anti-Submarine Operations.5. H.M. Sloop Arbutus sank U. 70 (517 tons) on the 7th March 300 miles to the north-west of the Butt of Lewis and captured 25 of her crew. This U-boathas previously been rammed and damaged by the Dutch s.s. Mijerecht which she had attacked. Five other attacks have been made by surface craft in the North-Western Approaches, and of these the most promising was by H.M. DestroyerWolverine on the 8th March.A Sunderland aircraft dropped depth charges close to a diving submarine onthe 9th and directed destroyers to the area, but these were unable to make contact,In the Mediterranean H.M. Destroyer Greyhound sank the Italian U-boatAnfitrite (590 tons) off the south-east of Crete on the 6th March and took 39prisoners.Enemy Intelligence.German.6. Prior to being sighted by H.M.S. Malaya, the battle-cruisers Scharnhorstand Gneisenam had last been reported leaving Oslo Fjord in the first week in
February, and it seems possible that they were responsible for the attack ons.s. Trelawney about 500 miles east of Newfoundland on the 22nd February.Air reconnaissance of German Naval Ports showed that at Kiel a battleshipof the Bismarck type was in the southern floating dock, a Hipper class cruiser inthe northern floating dock, the Pocket Battleship Lutzow alongside at theTorpedo Boat Haven and a Nurnberg class cruiser in the No. 6 Dry dock.A Schlesien class battleship was also seen. At Wilhelmshaven the Tirpitz wasnot seen in parts of the port which were covered by the photographs and which included the Bauhafen, where she was seen on the 26th February.In the course of the 12th March and the night following a series of reportswas received of large enemy warships seen by aircraft in the Heligoland Bight.These were confirmed by a reconnaissance on the 13th March, and the ships arethought to have been two 6-inch cruisers.The Hipper class cruiser which had been in dry dock at Brest since february was seen to have moved out on the 10th March. On the following dayshe was seen exercising in Douarnenez Bay and returning to Brest in the evening.On the morning of the 13th March she was again seen either berthing or about to leave.Italian.7. Air reconnaissance photographs of Taranto taken on the 7th Marchshowed three 8-inch cruisers protected by nets, the sunken battleship and fourmerchant ships in the outer harbour, and in the inner harbour one battleship inthe graving dock, four cruisers, seven destroyers, one submarine, thirty seaplanesand two merchantmen.Air reconnaissances of Tripoli continue to show very considerable activity atthe port. On the 10th March there were seventeen ships of between six andthirteen thousand tons in the harbour, ten merchant ships escorted by motor boatsapproaching the harbour, and one ship of nine thousand and two of six thousand tons lying at anchor outside.The Italian cruiser sunk by H.M. Submarine Upright on the 25th Februaryis stated to be the Armando Diaz (5,000 tons, eight 6-inch guns, built 1932).U-Boats.8. There have been certainly eight or nine German U-boats in the North-West Approaches throughout the week, and in the earlier part there may havebeen more. In addition there have been at least three Italians. Of the Germansat least two were about 250 miles north-west of the Hebrides and one or twoabout 150 miles further west. It is probable that a fresh group of three or fourGermans have now arrived in the area about 220 miles to the north-west of theHebrides, one of them having been sighted by aircraft during the forenoon ofthe 13th March. A German U-boat off the west coast of Africa sank five ships of a Sierra Leone Convoy in the early hours of the 8th March. This U-boat,which was certainly south-bound before the attack, has not been traced since.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. During the period, the 5th to the 12th March, 34 ships and 2 small craft,a total of 163,709 tons, have been reported sunk, and of these 24 ships and 2 small craft (125,935 tons) were British.  -Thirteen ships (85,857 tons) were sunk by U-boat, four of them off the westcoast of Africa, the others in the North-Western Approaches. Only 4 of these ships were actually sunk during the period under review.Six ships (20,519 tons) were reported sunk by aircraft, but news of one ofthese, the Sovac, has just been received from New York and, if it is confirmed,she can be removed from the list. The sinkings occurred in the North-western approaches, the Irish Sea and off the east coast of England. Four ships andtwo small craft (5,963 tons) were mined, three of them were sunk off Dungeness,and the remainder in the Thames, area. Ten ships (47,041 tons) were sunk by surface craft, 3 of them by E-boats off Cromer, the others being raider casualties in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Seventeen British ships and 3 Allied havebeen damaged, the majority of them by aircraft.[22312] B
Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. In the week ending the 12th March 781 ships, including 146 allied and 16 neutral, were convoyed. During the week news has been received of.19 ships lost in convoy by enemy action, and this number includes the losses inthe outward convoy attacked on the 26th February, details of which were not previously available. Since the start of the war 264 ships have been lost in convoy or one ship in 213. Two battleships, one battle cruiser, one aircraft carrier,one seaplane ship, four cruisers, eleven armed merchant cruisers, three submarines,58 destroyers and 47 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duty.11. In spite of delays and losses caused by exceptionally bad weather and enemy action, imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the weekending the 8th March totalled 640,178 tons, compared with 571,819 tons duringthe previous 7 days. Oil imports, in 20 tankers, totalled 208,696 tons. mineral imports were 130,376 tons, of which 59,219 tons were iron ore, scrap iron, pigiron and steel. Timber and wood pulp imports were 28,662 tons and cereal imports 93,256 tons. Other food imports totalled 110,625 tons, of which22,355 tons were sugar, 1,292 tons were fruit, 20,358 tons were tinned andrefrigerated meat and 8,384 tons were eggs. Imports of machinery and aircraft were again satisfactory.British Minelaying.12. On the 6th March H.M.S. Plover laid 120 mines in the St. George&apos;s channel, and on the 11th March 2.000 mines were laid in the Iceland-FaroesChannel.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. Between the 5th and 9th March the enemy laid two or more contactminefields at night between Dungeness and Selsey Bill in the track of the Channelconvoys. Mines were first encountered in this area on the 6th, and on the 10ththree coasters were sunk by an enlargement of the original field.Sweeping operations are being carried out by trawlers and Fleet minesweepers. Fine weather and a nearly full moon have increased the mining by enemy aircraft, the Tyne, the Humber, the Thames Estuary, Milford Havenand Liverpool all being visited.There have been 11 casualties due to mine, eight of which sank.Some traffic passed through the Suez Canal during the week, but it was mined again on the night of the 10th/11th, and will probably be closed until the15th March.During the week 52 acoustic and 15 magnetic mines have been detonated,four of the latter in the Suez Canal.Enemy Merchant Shipping.German.14. One of the conditions of the recent shipping agreement between germany and Sweden was that after the end of February the utmost use was. tobe made of Swedish ships in the ore trade. They would not, however, employthem from Narvik. Since the middle of January war risk rates for Swedish shipstrading to German ports in the North Sea, including Delfzyl, were 8 per cent.,whereas in the Baltic they were only 3 per cent, or 4 per cent. \      :!E-boats attacked east coast convoys on three nights, but were successfullydriven off on two occasions. On the 10th March a Channel convoy was bombed by aircraft and- shelled by long-range guns without result, but lost 3 ships in aminefield. J  -&quot;
MILITARY SITUATION.Balkan States.17. Germany continues to increase her forces in the Balkans and the totalnumber of divisions is now probably 30 to 32.At present the German dispositions in Bulgaria appear to be directed almostentirely against Greece, and there are probably about 13 divisions represented in the country, although all cannot yet be at full strength. Of these, possibly5 have reached the Greek frontier.There is no doubt that Germany intends to clear up the Greek affair either by negotiation or by military action, probably before the end of March. If sheattacks, she may go through the Vardar Valley in Southern Yugoslavia.Greece.18. During the last week the Greek offensive has been resumed in theTepelene area and has met with certain success, important heights having beentaken, together with more than 2,000 prisoners.Certain misgivings regarding the prospects of a German attack are reportedin Macedonia, but civilian morale is on the whole high, and is likely to remainso if the recent successes in Albania continue.Yugoslavia.19. No further confirmation has been received of the progress of mobilisa-tion,but it is reliably reported that the strength of the army has now reached800,000.The movements of the German fruit ships plying between Valencia andGenoa, continue to be reported.i The Norderney, 3,667 tons, at Para, Brazil, began loading on the 1st March.She has been showing considerable activity lately.Italian.15. The United States Naval Attache in Rome confirms the sinking of theConte Rosso (17,879 tons) and the Citta di Messina (2,472 tons) whilst carryingtroops. He states that there was I )avy loss of life and that German air mechanicswere among those drowned.On the 9th, S.O.S. messages were intercepted from the Cape Vita (5,775 tons)and the A ttilio Deffenu (3,510 tons), and on the following day from the Fenicia(2,584 tons) off the east coast of Tunis.A Greek communique has been published stating that the Greek submarine,Nereus sank one of two escorted supply ships about midnight on the23rd February.The.Cangnano, 5,753 tons, arrived at Kobe on the 10th March from Takao,Formosa, where she had been since June 1940. She has 5,000 tons of cargo, which includes rubber and soya beans.Considerable activity has been reported, among the Italian ships atLas Palmas and Teneriffe, where ships have been painting and taking in stores.At Las Palmas there are 8 ships (42,266 tons) and at Teneriffe 9 ships(44,196 tons); at the latter port the crews speak of sailing for Dakar.Economic Warfare.16. During the month of February 18,771 tons of cargo intended for theenemy were seized in prize, 18,218 tons being from French ships. The main itemswere 16,050 tons of food products and beverages, 827 tons of oil-seeds and 583 tonsof textiles. Among the individual commodities were 1,179 tons of frozen beef,833 tons of bananas, 444 tons of eggs and 347 tons of pineapples.Correction to Resume No. 79, paragraph 5 : For H.M.A.S. Australia readH.M.A.S. Canberra.
Turkey.20. Work has been begun on two new defence lines in Thrace, the first fromKirklareli, through Babaeski and Usunkopru and along the Ergene river; andthe second from Pinarhissar, through Luleburgas and thence along the Ergene.Both are in rear of existing defences in the Edirne (Adrianople) region. No-work has so far been reported along the Maritsa, which is actually the mostexposed area in Thrace.Africa.Libya.21. There is no evidence of any large-scale reinforcement of German forcesin North Africa during the past week, but reports continue to arrive of thepassage through Italy of German troops alleged to be destined for Libya. In spiteof reports that three, or even more, German divisions have landed in Tripoli,there is no reliable evidence that more than one division is actually in north africa.22. Contact has been made between our troops and those of the enemy on several occasions and on the 6th March German bombers attacked our forces nearDerna. On the 8th March five enemy aircraft bombed Benina, 10 miles east ofBenghazi. No damage was caused. Enemy aircraft which attacked M.T. atAgedabia and also an artillery convoy 25 miles S.S.W. of that place did verylittle damage.A abyssinia.23. In the Blue Nile Sector our troops have captured Afodu escarpmentand are advancing to Asosa. The enemy lost 20 killed and 20 captured and they also abandoned 4 guns and a considerable quantity of stores, &amp;c. Our casualties were 35.In the Gojjam area patriot forces pressing the retreating garrison of Buryehave captured Dambacha, together with many stores, and have crossed the riverTemcha.Italian Somaliland.24. In Italian Somaliland our troops have continued their advance and occupied Daghabur, which is 100 miles south of Jijiga on the Mogadishu-Ffararroad. Enemy losses sustained since our crossing of the Juba river are now estimated at over 31,000.In other sectors our troops are continuing their pursuit of Italian forcesretreating towards the Abyssinian frontier.Far East.25. Japanese occupation of China still extends only along the main lines ofcommunication, particularly the Yangtze river, and a few miles on either side.There is no definite front line, and Chinese regular troops, in addition toguerrillas, operate many miles behind the foremost points permanently occupiedby the Japanese.It is unlikely that the Japanese can extend their present occupation without an addition to their present forces in China, which is the equivalent of 30divisions. It is also unlikely that they can withdraw more than six of these divisions and still maintain their present positions.Convoys.26.   Further reinforcements reached Suez on the 12th March, comprising (a) 7,000 Australians, including an A.A. regiment, corps, base and L. of C.troops, and reinforcements.(&amp;) 3,765 New Zealanders.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.27. Aircraft of Bomber Command have successfully attacked Berlin,Bremen and Hamburg. A Coastal Command aircraft torpedoed a Germandestroyer. There was an increase in enemy operations against this country,especially at night.   Our night fighters are meeting with increasing success.Operational aircraft battle casualties and extracts from recent RaidAssessment Reports are given in Appendices VI andVII.Germany and Occupied Territory.28. During the week Bomber Command flew 27 sorties by day and 343 by night.Day.29. Blenheims carried out individual attacks on a number of selectedtargets. A direct hit was made on an oil cistern at Rotterdam and two firesresulted from an attack on Zuilen; Den Helder Docks were bombed by two of our aircraft and the gas works and railway siding at Sluiskel, eighteen miles north of Ghent, by another. Coastal Command Blenheims made two good attacks onthe aerodromes at Ockernburg and Ruygenhoek, north of Rotterdam.On the 10th March eight fighter squadrons carried out sweeps over northern france without encountering any serious opposition. AA. fire was reported tobe heavy and accurate at 30,000 feet.Night.30. The reduction in the scale of our night bombing is accounted for bythe unsuitable weather conditions which prevailed during most of the week.Full advantage, however, was taken of the improvement which occurred on the night of the 12th/13th March, and 258 bombers were despatched, includingStirling, Halifax and Manchester aircraft. The main targets were in Berlin,Bremen and Hamburg. A feature of the attack on Berlin was the number oflarge-size bombs which were dropped; these included 10 of 1,900 lbs. and 7 of1,000 lbs. Most bombs fell in the target area, causing a great many fires. AtBremen, the Focke Wulf airframe factory was heavily attacked, and a longbuilding burst into flames; a hit with a 1,000-lb. bomb was registered in themiddle of this target and a terrific explosion ensued. Good fires were also reportedto be burning in the industrial area of the town. Nearly seventy other aircraftconcentrated their attack on the Blohm and Voss shipbuilding yards at Hamburg,where large fires were started, and a smaller number bombed the industrial areas.During these raids our aircraft were subjected to intense A.A. fire and search-light dazzle.31. On the night of the lOth/llth, seventeen Hampdens attacked industrial targets in Cologne and a huge fire was reported on the west side of theHohenzollern Bridge; another attack, during conditions of good visibility, wasmade on the shipbuilding yards at Kiel, and 28 tons of H.E. bombs were dropped.Attacks were also made on the docks at Boulogne, Havre, St. Nazaire, Dieppeand on a number of other military objectives in Germany and occupied territory.During these operations our aircraft were attacked on several occasions by enemynight fighters, two of which they shot down; in addition Blenheims of fighter command, which carried out offensive.patrols over aerodromes in northern france, attacked a number of enemy bombers, two of which they damaged. eight of our bombers are missing from all these operations. ....Coastal Reconnaissance, Patrols and Mining.32. Aircraft of Coastal Command flew 189 patrols and photographicreconnaissances involving 274 sorties; in addition, 428 sorties were made inprotection of convoys.33.   A number of enemy merchant vessels were attacked by Coastal command aircraft and a direct hit with a 500 lb. bomb was scored on a vessel of 2,500 tons[22312] c
off the Hook of Holland, which was last seen in a sinking condition; a Beaufortsuccessfully torpedoed an enemy destroyer in the Skagerrak, as already reported.Bomber Command Blenheims probably hit a trawler north of Ijmuiclen and scorednear misses on two small merchant vessels off Texel. A Hudson shot down anHe. 59 near Horns Reef.34. Enemy minelayers were considerably more active than during theprevious week, about 215 aircraft being so engaged, 90 of which were employedon the night of the 10th/ 11th March. Our shipping was attacked off the east coast, in the Channel, and in the Western Approaches on most days and also at night, while daily offensive reconnaissances were made over the Atlantic, to thewest of Ireland.United Kingdom.35. Fighter Command flew 770 patrols, involving 2,346 sorties by day, and334 patrols, involving 541 sorties by night.36. During the week under review there was a slight increase, comparedwith the previous week, in the scale of daylight operations against this country,and a considerable increase by night, 1,160 enemy aircraft being employed at night (including 215 suspected of mine-laying), compared with 440.37. By day enemy activity consisted mainly of coastal patrols, small fightersweeps over South-East England and attacks on shipping and on aerodromes.38. On the first two nights of the week enemy activity was negligible, buton the night of the 8th/9th March a series of fairly heavy raids began, thenumber of aircraft operating ranging between 140 and 265. The raids werewidespread, but the main concentrations were on the London, Portsmouth,Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester areas. Several aerodromes were also attacked. Fourteen enemy night bombers were destroyed during the week, seven of these being shot down by our night fighters.Egypt and Libya.39.   Our activity has again consisted largely of reconnaissances and patrols.Tripoli harbour was attacked three times, and bursts were observed on therailway tracks near the quays, and several fires were started. The aerodromes atTamet, Sirte and Makina were also bombed. At Makina a Wellington destroyedfive enemy aircraft on the ground and damaged several others.Enemy aircraft attacked Jedabya twice, without causing damage orcasualties.Italian East Africa.40. In Eritrea our operations were again in support of our troops investingKeren. The defences of that town were heavily bombed, as well as the railway and roads leading to the sea. At Asmara oil dumps were destroyed and at Zulaan enemy flying boat was destroyed by a Blenheim. Assab was bombed on two occasions.41. In Abyssinia activity was on a reduced scale. Attacks were made onDiredawa, on Debra Markos, 120 miles north-west of Addis Ababa, and on Harar,where barracks were hit. At Asosa two enemy bombers were destroyed on theground by fighters of the South African Air Force. Several reconnaissances ofSouthern Abyssinia were flown.42. In Italian Somali land our activity was confined to reconnaissance flights in advance of our troops.Greece and Albania.43. Our operations were again mainly in support of ground operations inthe Tepelene sector, where communications, transport and troops were success-fully attacked. Harbour installations at Durazzo were bombed by fourWellingtons on the night of the 8th/9th March, and several fires and explosionswere caused.
44. Our aircraft have again shown their superiority over those of theenemv. On the 9th . March, fifteen Gladiators engaged thirty-five enemy bombers and thirty fighters, and destroyed one bomber and six fighters for theloss of one Gladiator, and on the 11th, sixteen Gladiators engaged seventeenenemy fighters, destroying four and damaging three.Dodecanese.45. The aerodromes at Kattavia and Calato, in the Isle of Rhodes, were bombed on the night of the 10th/ 11th March by six Blenheims and sevenWellingtons, and several fires were started, followed by violent explosions.Malta.46. Numerous small-scale bombing and machine-gun attacks were madeon the Island, both by day and by night. The heaviest was on the night of the10th/11th March, when twenty bombers inflicted damage on the dockyard andon the aerodrome at Luqa. Takali aerodrome and flying boats in St. PauFsBay were also attacked during the week. During these operations four of our aircraft were destroyed, while the enemy lost three and probably a furtherfour.Our aircraft carried out reconnaissances of Taranto and of the westernportion of the Ionian Sea.Air Intelligence.Balkans.47. German Air Force. The Germans have concentrated in Roumania thefollowing air forces :- 40 dive bombers.120 single-engined fighters.40 twin-engined fighters.42 bomber-reconnaissance aircraft.120 army co-operation aircraft.70-80 transport aircraft.and in Bulgaria : 40 long-range bombers.80 dive bombers.In addition, preparations are being made which are estimated to allow a further80 single-engined fighters and up to 120 army co-operation aircraft to be operatedfrom Bulgaria in about 10 clays. It wTould be possible to operate from Bulgariathe whole of the German air forces now in Roumania by about the first week inApril, but it is unlikely that Roumania would be left without air forces.48. Yugoslavia, Measures to place the Air Force on a war footing continue,and formations and units are moving to their war stations.Central Mediterranean.49. German air forces have been increased by a staffel of long-range bombersexperienced in minelaying, bringing the establishment up to 170 Long-Range Bombers.160 Dive-Bombers.20 Bomber Reconnaissance.40 Twin-Engined Fighters.40 Single-Engined Fighters.100/200 Transport.About 200 of these aircraft are in Sicily and 200 in Tripolitania,Italian Air Force in Belgium.50. It is reported that some Italian aircraft were recently seen flying overMiddleburg in Holland. These were presumably G. 50 fighters, the remnant ofthe &quot; token &quot; force of I tali an aircraft, left behind in Belgium. It is known thatthey carry out occasional patrols and operational training flights.
German Air Force Planning for 1941.51. Aircraft. It would appear that the long-range bomber force will haveto rely on existing and improved existing types with the introduction of onlyone new type in any quantity (Do. 217). The fighter force will also rely primarily on improved existing types. No new types are expected to be introduced in anyquantity during 1941. It would seem from this that the German Air Force atthe beginning of the war decided to rely on large numbers of their then up-to-datetypes to see them through and laid out their production programme accordingly.The almost complete lack of reports of new types likely to be available in numbersduring 1941 supports this view.52. A aerodromes in Occupied Territory. The scale of the work being under-taken indicates a long-term policy and the employment of bombers carrying very heavy loads. It also indicates that experiments in &quot; assisted take-off &quot; have notbeen successful.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.53. Enemy bombing has again been on a small scale. The only importantincident occurred at Newark on the 7th March, when a factory was raided twicecausing considerable damage and loss of life.Minor incidents included attacks on six R.A.F aerodromes where only slight damage was done, and some bombing and machine-gun attacks in East Anglia.By i Night.54. There has been a considerable increase in enemy bombing. On the8th/9th March there was a serious attack on London involving 50 boroughs, butdamage of national importance was very slight. Fires were caused at the Londonand Surrey Docks but were quickly extinguished. The Cafe de Paris in coventry Street received a direct hit; 34 people were killed and about 80 othersseriously injured. A Public House in Islington was also hit and 14 people were killed. High explosives were dropped on the North Lodge and in the Court Yardof Buckingham Palace. The following night London was again attacked buton a smaller scale, and there was widespread bombing in East Anglia.Portsmouth was raided twice but no serious damage was done.55. On the night of the 10th/11th March there was a heavy attack onPortsmouth and the Gosport and Fareham areas. On the following night, the11th/ 12th March, bombing was very widespread and covered nearly the wholeof England. Main concentrations were in the Manchester, Birmingham,Southampton-Portsmouth and London areas.56. On the night 12th/13th March the heaviest and most widespread attackfor several months took place. Every region in the country was involved, but themain enemy effort was directed against the docks at Liverpool, Wallasey andBirkenhead, where house property and utility services suffered extensively, but none of the damage inflicted appears to be vital. Apart from Southampton,where the Corporation Reservoir and Harland and Wolffs yards were attacked,there was no other outstanding incident in the rest of the country.In the London Region there was only minor bombing at Dagenham.Damage.London.57. On the 8th/9th March and the following night the docks were involved.There were a number of fires at sheds and warehouses, but damage was slight.There were many hits on the railways involving delay and dislocation. three main line termini, Fenchurch Street, Liverpool Street, and Waterloo were affected, and also several stretches of the London Passenger Transport BoardSystem.  Utility services suffered less harm than in previous raids and no reports
of shortage of water for fire fighting have been received. The only failure of gassupplies on any appreciable scale was at Bermondsey, where the damage was only temporary. One key point, Redline Glico&apos;s Oil Refinery at West Ham, was hit,but the damage was not severe. Two telephone exchanges were hit, one (Bishops-gate) being put out of action.Portsmouth.58. The Portsmouth area v/as bombed on five nights of the week, but onlyon the night of the 10th/11th was any important damage caused. On that nightthere were extensive fires in the Naval Dockyard and at the Royal ClarenceVictualling Yard. Three cisterns were fired at the R.N. Fuel Oil Depot atGosport, where two magazines were exploded and considerable damage was done to Naval shore establishments. Damage to two underground cables caused acomplete failure in Portsmouth electricity supply, but as no direct damage was done to the Power Station it is expected that repairs will be completed quickly.The Power Station of the Dockyard system was considerably damaged and thissupply also failed.Manchester.59. In the raid on Manchester on the night of the 11th/12th, bombing was mainly in the Trafford Park industrial district and the suburban areas; the com-mercial area in the centre of the city was not involved. Very little importantdamage was done except at the Anglo-American Oil Company&apos;s installation,where five cisterns were set on fire.Liverpool.60. The attack on the night of the 12th/13th was concentrated mainly onthe dock areas of Liverpool and Birkenhead. Many fires were started and alarge floating crane was sunk. Damage to industrial premises does not appearto have been serious, but much damage was done to private property and utilityservices. The electricity supply has failed in four districts of Liverpool, and throughout Wallasey, which is also without gas, but it is expected that these services will be quickly restored.Elsewhere.61. Nine aerodromes were hit without causing important damage. during a daylight attack on the 7th at Newark-on-Trent extensive structural damage was done to the works of Ransome and Maries Bearing Company, and production is stopped for at least seven days.Casualties.62. For the week ending 0600 hours 12th March, casualties are estimatedat 356 killed and 860 seriously injured. These figures do not include servicecasualties.[22312]d
