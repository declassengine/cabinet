3CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET. /     Copy No.W.P. (45) 296.Hth May, 1945. ^ iWAR CABINET.VISITS BY MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT TO THE UNITED STATES.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.Mr. Rhys Davies, M.P., applied last month for an exit permit and travel facilities to go to the United States in order to fulfil an invitation he had received to address meetings organised by the American Friends Service Committee. TheMinistry of Information was asked by the Foreign Office whether we would be willing to sponsor Mr. Rhys Davies&apos;s journey. We replied that we could not,because our function is to publicise the British war effort and it is not ourbusiness to sponsor lecture tours as in the national interest when their purposefalls outside our limited wartime sphere.Nevertheless, it is surely wrong, now that hostilities in Europe have ended,to place impediments in the way of Members of Parliament who wish to visitAmerica. It is no longer possible to pass judgment on the desirability of theirjourneys merely on the ground of whether or not they will contribute to publicisingthe British war effort. I therefore suggest that all Members wishing to make such visits should receive automatic backing from His Majesty&apos;s government without anyone having, to advise on whether their presence there would be goodor bad from the point of view of publicity.B. B.Ministry of Information,lUh May, 1945.[29885]



TOP SECRETPOSTSCRIPTThis review is calculated on the assumption previously laid down by the War Cabinet,viz., that the German War would end on 31st May. It has in fact ended on 8th May.It would take a considerable time to amend all the figures in the memorandum and I havenot attempted to do so. But, in brief, it may be said that the releases under Class A up to31st December next would be increased by about 60,000, the Class B releases by some 6,000,and the demand for intakes goes up in consequence by 6,000.I now hear that the Admiralty are unable to let us have the last 6,500 of the previouslyauthorized transfers. The required intake will therefore rise by a further 6,500. The finalfigure for intake up to December, 1945 therefore becomes 189,000. Of this figure all but28,000 are required to offset future Class B and special releases. Against this 28,000 and inthe same period we shall release over 500,000 men and women under Class A and nearly 50,000men under Class B.   In the following 6 months we shall release a further million.P. J. G.zoth May, 1945.
