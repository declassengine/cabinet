(An outline map is included as an inset.)General.20. Main progress during the week has been on the southern flank, whereFrench and U.S. troops have broken through to the Danube. In the centre, theCentral Group of Armies have closed up to the general line of the Mulde andElbe rivers, whilst in the north, British forces have reached the Elbe on a widefront south of Hamburg, and to the west, have reached the outskirts of Bremen.Of second importance only to the battles on the Allied flanks, are two victorieseliminating the Ruhr pocket and virtually clearing the whole of N.E. Holland.The German pockets on either side of the Gironde estuary have also been wipedout, thus freeing Bordeaux.Southern Sector.21. The French and US. thrust towards the Danube had by the21st/22nd iVpril assumed the proportions of a complete break-through, whentroops of the First French Army, besides capturing Freiburg and Stuttgart,reached the Swiss frontier west of Lake Constance and had sent an armouredcolumn along the north shore of the Lake. This column has since pressed on south of the Danube to Ulm, west of which it made contact with US. armouradvancing S.E. of Stuttgart. Further east, a bridge over the Danube at Dillingenwas seized intact by US. troops and a firm bridgehead formed. Donauworthon the northern bank of the river has been reached.By the 21st all resistance had ceased on both sides of the Gironde estuary.The whole operation, which started on the 14th, yielded 10,000 prisoners.Central Sector.22. Steady progress was reported on the Third U.S. Army front until the23rd, when a rapid advance down the Danube valley began. Since then, one armoured division has driven 70 miles towards the Austrian frontier at Passau,while infantry has taken Regensberg on the Danube.Troops of the First US. Army closing up to the line of the Mulde and Elberivers, captured Leipzig on the 20th and Dessau on the 23rd. All organised resistance ceased in the Hartz mountains area on the 21st. Headquarters ofthe German Eleventh Army and three Corps Commanders were captured. the ruhr pocket was finally liquidated on the 18th, some 17 divisions being destroyed and over 320,000 prisoners taken.The Ninth U.S. Army has made good progress in clearing the enemy salientaround Salzwedel.Northern Sector.,23. There has been hard fighting by the Second British Army approachingHamburg and Bremen. The Elbe as reached on a wide front near Lauenbergon the 19th, and the British hold on the river was quickly expanded. On the 25tha new attack was launched on the southern outskirts of Bremen, while othertroops fought their way in from the east of the port.The First Canadian Army has continued its task of clearing N.E. Holland,and has also made some progress in the direction of Utrecht.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)24. The Allied offensive has continued at a speed far in advance of ourhopes. Allied troops are now on the River Po from S. Benedetto eastwards tothe sea; Eighth Army are across it south of Badia, whilst Fifth Army are surging
across in great strength S.E. of Mantua, leading elements being already within9 miles of Verona. Thus in the first 18 days of the offensive, Eighth Army hasmade advances of up to 45 miles, and Fifth Army up to 70 miles.In the Adriatic sector, British infantry continued to make progress N.W.through the Argenta defile against strong enemy resistance, capturing Porto-maggiore on the 19th. On the following clay a British armoured formationpassed through, and the advance continued toward Ferrara and Bondeno on a wider front. The latter town was captured on the 23rd but resistance in Ferraracontinued so strong that our reinforced infantry by-passed to the west and reachedthe Po on the same date. This manoeuvre secured us Ferrara on the 24th. Tothe east of Ferrara other British and Italian forces have advanced in conformity,reaching the river on the 25th.Meanwhile, Indian and Polish forces pushed on astride Highway 9 againstdecreasing resistance, capturing Budrio on the 20th. Bologna was entered byPolish forces early on the following day, a few hours before U.S. troops from thesouth. The advance switched then to the north and proceeded at a rapid rate tothe Po river, which was reached on the 24th arid crossed in strength the folloivingday-The Fifth Army, in the meantime, had got its attacks well under way by the19th, and rapid progress was made south and even more rapidly, S.W. of Bologna.By the 22nd leading elements had reached a line 15 miles north and 25 miles N.W:of Bologna; on the following day U.S. mountain troops fought through toS. Benedetto, two regiments crossing the Po river as soon as they reached it. Onthe 24th and the 25th the bridgehead was extended, and the deep salient south ofthe river between Bondeno and S. Benedetto was filled up. A second and thirdbridgehead was gained at Ostiglia, and east of it, and strong forces pressed northto Nogaro, Isola and to a point 9 miles S.W. of Verona.Meanwhile U.S. armour thrust N.W. from the Marzobotto area, capturingModena and Guastalla (on the Po) on the 23rd. The advance has since pressedwest from Guastalla to a point south of the river and north of Parma. On the left, U.S. infantry seized Reggio on the 25th and pushed on to within 12 miles ofParma.On the Ligurian coast coloured and Jap-American forces continued to advance and captured Spezia on the 24th.Russian Front.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.25. With the capture of the port of Pillau by the Russians on the 25th.organised German resistance in East Prussia is almost at an end. Some german forces still remain on the Frische Nehrung, S.W. of the town, and two otherpockets in the Danzig Bay, in the area of the Vistula River mouth and on theHel Peninsula north of Danzig, are still offering stubborn resistance.Central Sector.26. The Russian offensive which began on the 16th has, after 10 days&apos;fighting, completely encircled Berlin and further south has crossed the River ElbeN.W. of Dresden.The main attacks were launched from two points, one across the River Oder,clue east of Berlin, and the other across the River Neisse, S.E. of Cottbus. TheRussian right wing made relatively slow progress in the first two or three days,but after the capture of Wriezen on the 20th the attack gathered s*peed and bythe 22nd the Russians were fighting inside the N.E. suburbs of Berlin. further progress inside the city has taken the Russians to within one mile of the centre of the capital, whilst other forces, by-passing Berlin to the north, cut the mainBerlin-Hamburg railway on the 24th and have now swung round west ofPotsdam.Meanwhile, other forces achieved a major armoured breakthrough betweenCottbus and Bautzen and swung northwards towards Berlin; on the 24th onearm of the attack linked up with the forces in the S.E. suburbs, and formed apocket of German troops caught between Frankfurt and Cottbus. The following day troops of this command, advancing to the S.W. of the capital, met russian forces advancing from the north in the area west of Potsdam, and thus completed the encirclement of Berlin.[29794] b 2
On the left wing of the armoured breakthrough, steady progress was made towards the River Elbe and on the 25th, Soviet troops crossed the river and captured Reisa, 25 miles N.W. of Dresden.On the extreme left flank of the Russian attack, strong German counter-attacks are reported in the Bautzen-Gorlitz area; the Germans are claimingsuccesses in this area, but have reported only slight gains of ground.Little fighting of. major importance has been reported from the rest of theCentral Sector, except for some Russian progress towards the Morava Gap,which resulted in the capture of Troppau on the 23rd.Southern Sector.27. Heavy fighting has been reported from the Brno area, but only smalladvances have been claimed by the Russians; fighting is now taking place in the outskirts of the town. On other parts of this front there has been fighting of onlylocal importance.Burma.28. Our troops occupied Singm Chauk and Sale without opposition onthe 19th. On the western bank of the Irrawaddy they have continued their advance to a point 10 miles north of Sal in.Yenangyaung, on the eastern bank, was captured on the 23rd. Our troops have crossed&quot; the river unopposed and are within 8 miles of Salin from the eastand S.W. Magwe was captured by troops from the Natmauk area on the 20th.A link-up between these forces and those from Yenangyaung has all but takenplace. Other troops driving westwards from Taungdwinggyi area, have reachedthe Irrawaddy opposite Minhla and have a column only 6 miles from Magwe,operating on the road Taungdwinggyi-Magwe.The drive southwards from the Yamethin area has made rapid progress.Pyinmana was captured against opposition on the 23rd, and the Toungooairfields were occupied on the same day. Toungoo itself fell on the 24th. Leadingelements of our forces have now reached the outskirts of Pyu, where fighting isin progress.China.29. Japanese activity continues in the area west of Paoching, and advanceelements are now some 60 miles from Chihkiang. The U.S. airfield at Chihkianghas been closed to transport aircraft, but is understood to be still in use for operational purposes.Pacific.Philippines.30. In northern Luzon, U.S. forces are closing in on Baguio, but progress has been slow in face of stubborn enemy resistance. There have been no majordevelopments in southern Luzon.On the 17th, U.S. forces made two further landings on Mindanao, at Parangand Malabang, on the S.W. coast of the Island. No serious opposition was encountered, and subtantial progress has been made especially in the southernsector where an advance, nearly half way across the Cotobato Peninsula, has beenmade.&apos; On the 20th, U.S. troops made a further landing on Cebu Island at Danao,16 miles N.E. of Cebu City. No opposition was encountered and they areadvancing south towards the main U.S. forces, which are still engaged in stifffighting in the area just north of Cebu City.Ryukyus.31. The Japanese continue to put up most desperate resistance in southernOkinawa and in certain areas ground has changed hands several times. some progress, however, has been made on the U.S. left flank.10 U.S. Army troops have cleared the island of Ieshima, and the small islandswhich lie off the eastern coast of Okinawa.

Following the Bomber Command attack on the17th /T8th April, photographic reconnaissance undertaken-on the 19th Aprilshows that the western half of the yard has been destroyed. Little remains ofthe heavily loaded sidings except broken tracks and derailed and wrecked rolling stock. The goods depot has been more than three-quarters destroyed, and allthrough running lines have been blocked., Dresden. Following the U.S. VIII Air Force attack on the 17th April,severe damage is seen to have been caused in the marshalling yard sidings, to railfacilities, and to many tracks in the rail centre and Hauptbahnhof. In the marshalling yard, dense smoke was pouring from the locomotive depot and thelarge carriage and wagon repair shop at the time of photography. In the sortingand wagon sidings all tracks have been cut, and a number of wagons damaged or derailed. In the railway centre one of the locomotive sheds and several smallrailway buildings have been further affected, and numerous hits on tracks have caused considerable damage to rolling stock in the carriage sidings.
