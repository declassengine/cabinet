THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 302.15th May, 1945.WAR CABINET.NOTES ON SOME DISCUSSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.THE report of the Minister of Food and myself on our recent Mission tothe United States has been circulated to the War Cabinet as W.P. (45) 291.A number of other matters were also discussed with the Americans at the sametime.   My colleagues may care to have the attached notes on some of them.O. L.Ministry of Production,15th May, 1945.Copy NoCoal.THE critical situation in Europe as regards supplies of coal is recognised in the United States and it was emphasised in Judge Rosenman&apos;s report. TheUnited States have supplied and may be expected to continue to supply, limitedamounts where shipments can be made at not too great a cost. Shortage ofshipping, however, precludes the United States, quite apart from her own tightcoal position, from sending large quantities abroad. Europe must thereforelargely depend on her own production.The Combined Production and Resources Board has written to the combined chiefs of Staff drawing their attention to the critical position and suggesting thatthe Military Control Authorities should take the most drastic action to acceleratecoal production in Germany. Mining equipment is generally in very short supply. A combined world programme will need to be worked out which will ensure that the limited amounts of mining equipment as they become availablego to destinations where they can be put to best use.After discussion with the Minister of Fuel and Power, I arranged forDr. Potter, Deputy Solid Fuels Administrator and Chairman of the WashingtonCoal Committee of the Combined Production and Resources Board to visit theUnited Kingdom. He is due to arrive shortly. His arrival will enable us to dealnot only with the immediate requirements of S.H.A.E.F. and the Mediterraneanarea, but also to review the long-term outlook. He will visit the Continentaccompanied by United Kingdom officials. During his stay in the UnitedKingdom he will also discuss our coal production problems with special referenceto the supply and use of American mining machinery.Textiles.For some time to come supplies will be short, mainly owing to Par Easternrequirements. I am not hopeful that we can expect the United States to increase her exports very much, and I fear we must, in large measure, rely on our own efforts to meet the needs of our Far Eastern territories.I undertook to press on with our efforts here to increase production through an increase of the man-power employed and through greater efficiency in theindustry. Mr. Krug, Chairman of the War Production Board, undertook to[29898]
try to increase American production, but their difficulty in one respect is similarto ours, namely, the problem of attracting more workers into an industrywhere relatively low wages are paid, although their man-hour output is excellent.The possibility of increased Indian production should more fuel be available, isalso being examined.Trucks.The shortage of road transport in liberated areas is serious, and a numberof positive steps are being taken to relieve the situation. The greatest and mostimmediate help can come from surplus military vehicles now that Germany isdefeated and from an acceleration of the supplies of reconditioned vehicles and of spare parts. Through the CCS. the United States War Department and theWar Office are being asked to see what can be done. Canada will help materiallywith new production. The road transport position in the United States has deteriorated considerably during the war, and there is a good deal of leeway tobe made up there as well as here.Finance of Relief.At the request of the Secretary of State for War. and with the approval ofother interested departments. I undertook to discuss with Mr. McCloy (the assistant Secretary of the War Department) the problem of the continuation of the provision on a combined basis of supplies for the British zone of occupation in Germany in the event of the termination of S.H.A.E.F. as a combined commandbefore the establishment of the Control Commission.It was clear that this question was closely linked with the financial proposalsfor relief (recently approved by the War Cabinet), under which the ambassador had been instructed to tell the State Department that we could no longer continueto finance the provision of Civil Affairs supplies on the existing basis, as betweenthe United States, Canada and ourselves, but could in future only pay for thosesupplies provided from the resources of the United Kingdom and the Colonies.It was also proposed that U.N.R.R.A. should undertake the financial responsibilityfor supplies for Austria and Italy, although it was hinted that we were not anxious to contribute further to U.N.R.R.A.The position was, therefore, that we were to tell the Americans that we could in future only provide a very small part of the supplies, or of the money to finance them, so that the main burden of finance and supply would fall on the americans, while we retained complete freedom of distribution in our own zone.In the course of discussion with the Canadians it became clear that they werenot prepared to fall in with our financial &quot;proposals as a basis for continuedCanadian participation.I, therefore, took the following action : (a) I spoke to Mr. McCloy on the importance of maintaining the combinedsupply arrangements in one form or another, urging the necessity of treating at least the British and American zones as a single economic unit, but not mentioning the financial problem. Mr. McCloy wassympathetic and promised to consider the matter carefully. It laterappeared, howTever, that our chances of securing the maintenance ofthe combined machinery would be small, if we could provide neithersupplies or finance.(b) On my return, and in agreement with the War Office, I discussed thefinancial aspect with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of State. As a result of this discussion it was agreed that every effort must be made to secure that the cost of relief supplies to Germany was made a first charge on German resources, but if theseproved insufficient, we would contribute up to our share on the present basis for military relief supplies, although we hoped that additionalcountries (other than the United States and Canada) might also take their share. It was also agreed that in the case of Austria and Italyour original proposals should be put to the State Department.
