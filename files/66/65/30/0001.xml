DRAFT STATEMENT ON BUSK A POLICYTlie considered policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government toestablish full self-government in Burma has frequentlybeen declared.    It Is and has consistently been our aim to assist her political development till she can sustain the responsibilities of complete self-government withinthe British Commonwealth and consequently attain a statu;equal to that of the Dominions and &quot;indeed of this count&apos;.- ,M     Inevitably Burma?s progress towards full self-government has been interrupted! and set back by theJapanese invasion and the long interval of enemy occupation and active warfare &quot;in her territories, duringwhich she has suffered p.rave damage not only in the formof material destruction but in a shattering of the foundations of her economic and social life,   it is, ofcourse, upon these foundations that a political Structurerests and&quot;until the foundations are once again firm, thepolitical institutions which were in operation before theJapanese invasion cannot be restored.For example, the removals and dispersal of the population and general, upheaval of life during enemy occupation will necessitate a complete revision of&quot;the electoral roils andpossibly the deterniinatlon of a new franchise before stepscan be taken for a General Election; nor could an election be held throughout Burma until adequaterestoration of communications has been achieved.   There .is a most formidable task to be faced in the re-establish-ment of stable conditions, the restoration of buildings,communications and public utilities and in the reliabilityation of agriculture and the other essential industries which are the life blood of the country,   Till this is done, conditions are lacking in which the requirements ofa democratic system of government can be met; and theseessential tasks will fall to the civil Government as soon.,as operational requirements permit the transfer of theadministration to it from the military authorities; theywill be beyond the financial resources of Burma in her present ravaged condition   and His majesty&apos;s Governmentwill have to come to her aid   but they will require theenergetic co-operation of all sections of the Burmesepeople, and the more completely this can be given the sooner will it be possible for Burma to resume herInterrupted progress in constitutional development.3.     Until these foundations are restored sufficiently toenable the first essential political process to be under-taken, that is for a General Election to be held, it isnot possible to re-establish a Burmese Government as itexisted in 1941, and for a limited interim period theadministration will have to be carried on by the governor and officials subordinate to him in direct responsibility to His Majesty&apos;s Government.   It is accordingly necessary,so long as the government of the country cannot becarried on in accordance with the provisions of the 1935Act, that recourse should continue to be had to theprovisions of Section 139,   As the proclamation, issued in 1942, exhausts its validity in December next, it is

proposed, to make it permissible to prolong its validityfor three years more, that is till 9th December 1948.Parliament is asked to approve this extension for aperiod of three years only, in the hope that it will be possible by then, if not before, to establish conditionsin which a General Election can be held and a government established under the normal constitutional methods.    if in the event this hope were not fulfilled, it might benecessary to ask Parliament to approve a further extension.   So far, however, as can be judged now, threeyears should suffice.   But though this initial period oicontrolled government is necessary, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are anxious that all trie functions of govern-rnent should net in fact be concentrated in the Governor,but that he should be provided with definite means ofobtaining Burmese assistance and advice in the dischargeof. them, and leave power to associate with himselfrepresentatives of Burmese opinion in executive capacitiesIt is proposed therefore to take power to introduce byOrders in Council modifications to enable the autocraticsystem of administration authorised by Section 139 as it now stands to be liberalised,   It is contemplated that early opportunity will be taken under these proposedpowers to establish an Executive Council which, though itmight at the outset be a small and mainly official body,could be expanded as opportunity offers by the inclusion in it of non-official Burmese.   Such a Council would,pending the revival of normal constitutional methods,give Burmans a share in the administrative task of restoring the economy of their country, subject to theretention of the Governor&apos;s powers of supervision andcontrol.   Such power to act by Order in Council might also be used at an appropriate stage, if recommended bythe Governor and his Executive Council, to establish asan interim body a small Legislative Council.   the composition and powers of these bodies and the relationsbetween them would be prescribed, by Orders in Council&quot;after submission to Parliament.4,     The immediate purpose of such new and experimentalinstitutions, brought in by Order In Council, would be to relax the more autocratic regime which Section 139prescribes, but in so far as they would be introduced,under the authority of that section as now proposed to be amended, they would themselves necessarily lapse when thetime comes for the operation of that Section to be terminated.    It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that when conditions are sufficiently restored to make it possible to hold an election  and terminate theoperation of Section 139, the normal provisions of theAct (unless amended by the Incorporation of temporary provisions which, had been found to commend themselves toBurmans) will re-enter into force,   A General Electioncould then be held, and a Legislature formed with thesame degree of authority over the same range, of matters as it enjoyed before the Japanese invasion,5c     Government in accordance with the provisions of theAct of 1935 having thus been restored, as soon as theconditions in the country permit, a second phase inconstitutional development will begin, during which the

ground will be prepared for the attainment of fui:government.   At the same time the necessary measures forthe restoration of Burma&apos;s economy beyond the point whichmust be attained before even the first General Electioncan be held, would continue and her - financial positionwould, progressively develop towards a standard of self-sufficiency.   Our ultimate&apos;objective during this phasewill be that representatives of the Burmese people, afterreaching a sufficient measure of agreement between thevarious parties and sections, should draw up a Constitutiaof a type which they themselves consider most suitable for burma, taking into account not only the British but theother various types of constitution in democraticallygoverned countries.   What the machinery for this should bewill be a matter for discussion and agreement with representative Burmanst     A simultaneous pro eess would bediscussion of the content of the agreements to be madewith His Majesty:&apos; s Government on matters on which thelatter would have continuing obligations after theestablishment of full self-government in Burma.6c     When once the duly appointed representatives of the burmese people have agreed, in the light of preparatorystudy of the subject, on the type of constitution mostsuitable for Burma, and it is clear that the proposedconstitution has a sufficient measure of support in burma to justify endorsement by Parliament, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will enter into discussions with representative-ives of Burma with a view to satisfactory agreementsbeing made to enable them to fulfil their continuingobligations and to safeguard any outstanding financialadvances made by His majesty&apos;s Government, so that;whenthe necessary administrative organisation is in existence-jand the other arrangements have been completed, full self-government .within the British Commonwealth canthereupon be established in Burma proper,,   Theadministration of the Scheduled Areas, that is the ShanStates and the tribal areas in the mountainous fringes ofthe country, inhabited ley peoples differing in language,social customs and degree of political development fromthe Burmans inhabitating the central areas, would remain for the time being a trusteeship responsibility of HisMajesty&apos;s .Government until such time as their inhabitantssignify their desire for some suitable form of amalgamat-ion of their territories with Burma proper.o
