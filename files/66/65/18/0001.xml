Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.W.P. (45) 268.2Uh April, 1945.WAR CABINET.BRITISH EXPORTS, GERMAN INDUSTRY AND REPARATIONS.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I have read W.P. (45) 224 with the greatest interest and satisfaction. the paymaster-General&apos;s conclusions seem to me to be realistic and irrefutable.I hope we shall be firm in our approach to the problems arising out of theeconomic treatment of Germany. I have on more than one occasion expressed myconcern about this matter at the A.P.W. Committee. Last year I informed mycolleagues that I should feel bound to ask nothing less than the total elimination of the German shipbuilding industry at the earliest possible moment after theGerman collapse.* In the last few days, in reply to the E.I.P.S. report on german industry proposing merely to suspend German shipbuilding for 10 years,I have submitted to the A.P.W. Committee a memorandum in which I have againurged the vital importance to -British security of the total elimination of Germanshipbuilding and shipping (A.P.W. (45) 59). This is primarily a question ofour security at sea but is necessarily bound up with our economic policy towardsGerman industry as a whole; in A.P.W. (45) 3 I reiterated my conviction that security against future war would demand drastic treatment of German industryand that such considerations as reparations, the German standard of living andthe interests of our own investors must take second place to this primary interestof national security. For this same reason I expressed doubts about a recentproposal by the Minister of Works (A.P.W. (45) 49) to explore the possibilities ofobtaining pre-fabricated houses from Germany.To conclude, I fully share the Paymaster-General&apos;s opinion that the restora-tion of German industry and German war potential must be discouraged even ifthis involves loss of reparations. The arguments he adduces to show that such apolicy on our part would not only be proper but practicable, appear to me to beconvincing.A. V. A.2Uh April, 1945.* A.P.W. (44) 15th Meeting, Item 2.[29775J
