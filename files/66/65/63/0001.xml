THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET. I Copy No.W.P. .(45) 313. x  /18th May, 1945.WAR CABINET.WAR CRIMINALS.Memorandum by the Attorney-General.AT the first meeting of the Committee appointed under my chairmanshipthe following questions arose which required reference to the War Cabinet: 1. The Committee considered the Draft Agreement dated the 3rd Maysubmitted by Judge Rosenmann on behalf of the United States Government,a copy of which is annexed. This agreement proposes the establishment of an inter-Allied Court for the trial of major war criminals and for the Gestapo and similar organisations. It therefore raises an issue on which the War Cabinetreserved their decision (W.M. (45) 57th Conclusion of the 3rd May).2. A question of principle arises on Clause 6 which adds to &apos;&apos; war crimes &apos;&apos;the attacks made by Germany on her neighbours and her war policy. It is tobe noted that the draft puts first under sub-paragraph (a) &quot;Violation of the laws and usages of war &apos;&apos; which can clearly be treated as &apos;&apos; crimes &apos;&apos; under Inter-national Law. The Committee felt that (b) to (e) were very wude and unnecessarilydetached from the actual circumstances with which we are dealing. Their sug-suggestions are expressed in the following redraft: (b) Pursuing a systematic policy for the purpose of dominating Europe bya war of aggression and in the carrying out of that policy.(1) Initiating and making attacks on other countries in violation of International Law, treaties or assurances.(2) Resorting to war as an instrument of national policy.Subject to this the Committee suggest that the Draft might be accepted in principle  IS cX basis for discussion.3. The draft in paragraph 15 proposes that the Tribunal should be anInternational Military Tribunal. The word &apos;&apos; Inter-Allied &apos;&apos; would be more appropriate than &quot;International&quot; and the War Office desired to raise thequestion as to the Tribunal being military. It is understood that the UnitedStates wuld have constitutional difficulties about setting up a tribunal if itwas not &quot;Military.&quot; Is it intended that all the members must be military officers 14. There were a number of points of presentation and detail which wouldbe raised with the other Allies concerned if the draft is accepted in princeple as a basis for discussion, but I do not think it is necessary to raise them at thisstage.5. If there are to be trials on the lines anticipated by the draft it will benecessary to consider and prepare the evidence.   This falls under two heads :  (a) Evidence as to German war policy.   On this the Foreign Office are preparing a documented statement.(b) Evidence of organised atrocities by the Gestapo or other Governmentorganisations which would be required in the organisation trials andin a &quot; major war criminal &quot; trial. There is a vast mass of material,and it will be necessary to concentrate on the gross examples fromoccupied countries and from Germany. If this is done it might wellbe possible to prove an overwhelming case without an immense number[29928] b
of witnesses. Lord Finlay undertook to look through the evidence inthe possession of the War Crimes Commission with this idea in mind.If the principles of the Agreement are accepted all those who areat present investigating and getting evidence should be given guidance in this sense.6. The United States Government have proposed that a body representingthe four Powers should be set up to prepare for prosecution and be responsiblefor the prosecution of the major war criminals and organisations to be tried by the Inter-Allied Court. Judge Jackson of the Supreme Court has beenappointed the United States representative and the question arises who shouldbe the British Governments representative.7. Prosecutions relating to Concentration Camps in Germany. As mostof the recent victims in camps already occupied are Allied nationals, those responsible can be proceeded against as &quot;war criminals&quot; on principles whichhave already been recognised and accepted. The Committee were informed thatthe United States authorities in S.H.A.E.F. were taking the view with regardto Buchenwald that as there were no American citizens in the camp it was not for them to prosecute and try those responsible. The victims belong to morethan one of the Allied nations and it seemed to the Committee worth considering whether in this and similar cases the trial of the Commandant and principaloffenders should be undertaken by the country which occupied the area in whichthe camp was. Their officers would have been the first to see the camp andinvestigations would have been carried out by them or under their control. Ifthis were thought right it would accelerate the trial and prevent disputes as towhich country should undertake it. No doubt if it were adopted representativesof all Allied countries whose nationals were victims would be taken into consulta-tion. The evidence as to these camps might be required in trials before theInter-Allied Court, but I assume that the Commandant and his accomplices wouldnot be regarded as of sufficient importance to require trial before that Court.D. B. S.18th May, 1945.ANNEX.&quot; Memorandum of Proposals &quot; submitted by Judge Rosenmann to a Meetingattended by Mr. eden, Mr. stettinius and Mr. molotov at san franciscoon 3rd May, 1945.Parties.1.
