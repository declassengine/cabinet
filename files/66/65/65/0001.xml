THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET. Copy No.        - , tiW.P. (45) 315.19*A May, 1945.WAR CABINET.AMENDMENT OF THE BRITISH SETTLEMENTS ACT, 1887.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.PROPOSED changes in certain Colonial Constitutions have shown thenecessity for an amendment of the British Settlements Act, 1887. This Actapplies only to Colonies which are &quot; British settlements.&apos;&apos; Section 3 enables HisMajesty to delegate powers of legislation for a British settlement to three or morepersons within the settlement. In the case of a composite territory which, thoughan administrative unit, includes both an area which is a British settlement andalso an area of some other kind (e.g., ceded Colony or Protectorate), the wordsquoted above do not permit the creation of a single legislature, including representatives from each area.2. Those words also prevent the vesting of reserved powers of legislation inthe Governor of the territory.3. To overcome these two difficulties I propose that Section 3 should be amended so as to enable powers of legislation to be delegated to any specifiedperson or persons or authority.4. Under the same section legislative power must be delegated in pursuanceof Letters Patent. In the case of an area under His Majesty&apos;s protection, the instrument for this purpose must, under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, bean Order in Council.. It is therefore not possible to deal in one instrument witha territory which is in part a British settlement and in part under His Majesty&apos;sprotection. I propose further, therefore, that the powers of Section 3 of the Actshould be made exercisable by Order in Council.5. These amendments would not appear to involve any contentious issueof policy, and I seek authority for the preparation of a Bill for consideration inthe Legislation Committee and its subsequent presentation to Parliament.O. S.Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,19th May, 1945.[29922J
