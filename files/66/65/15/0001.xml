THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.Copy No.WAR CABINET.THE STATE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.Note by the Secretary.BY direction of the Prime Minister I circulate herewith, for the considera-tion of the War Cabinet, a minute addressed to him by the Earl Marshal.(Signed)      E. E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,23rd April, 1945.ANNEX.Minute by the Earl Marshal.YOU asked me to submit a report on the discussions in the Palace of westminster with The King on the 4th April.The fundamental point to be decided is the place in which the State Openingshould be held. It was made clear that if the customary Ceremonial is to becarried out within the Palace of Westminster, then the only chamber suitableis that now used as the House of Commons.If this is agreed, the Procession and Ceremonial will be with certain smallalterations consequent on the war exactly the same as a pre-war State Opening.To carry out the above, however, will entail the House of Commons meetingelsewhere, from which to be summoned to hear the Gracious Speech. St. Stephen&apos;&quot;sHall was selected for this purpose. The Minister of Works said it wouldaccommodate about 300 Members.   It will only be used for the one morning.If this is agreed, the following procedure would be carried out as from theGeneral Election.The House of Commons will meet to elect their Speaker, and themselvestake the Oath in the Chamber now used as the House of Commons.At a later date it has been as much as a week later The King will openParliament. During the few days that intervene, the Minister of Works willrestore the present House of Commons to its former self as House of Lords. and at . Stephen&apos;s Hall will be prepared as the House of Commons.After the Opening of Parliament, both Houses will resume as at presentsituated. It is understood that it will take four hours to rearrange the Chamberfor the House of Commons. If, therefore, Parliament were opened at 11 a,m.,the Chamber would be free for the workmen at 12 noon, and the House couldresume at 5 p.m. for the debate on.the Address.The Minister of Works has seen and agrees with this minute and I attachherewith plans prepared by him showing structural alterations necessary.I may add that the proposals submitted above, if accepted, will certainlyprove the easiest to be carried out.NORFOLK.15th April, 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 265.23rd April, 1945.
