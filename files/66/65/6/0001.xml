(45) 256.13th April, 1945.WAR CABINET,DEFENCE OF THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate herewith, for the consideration of my colleagues, a note on thequestion of the defence of the Middle East in which I have embodied my comments on the recent report of the Suez Canal Committee of the War Cabinet.Foreign Office, 13th April, 1945.IN their report on future defence policy in the Suez Canal area(W.P. (45) 197 of the 20th March) the Suez Canal Committee formulate two questions, viz. : should they proceed on the assumptions 1(1) that responsibility for the defence of the Canal should be vested inHis Majesty&apos;s Government in perpetuity;(2) that His Majesty&apos;s Government, for political and strategic reasons,regard it as desirable that Great Britain should play the predominantpart in the defence and political control of the Middle East.2. In leading up to these questions, the Committee remarked that theForeign Office had hitherto regarded assumption (1), viewed as an objective, asaxiomatic; but that certain members felt there was much to be said in favourof international responsibility for the defence of the Canal as being more inharmony with the aims which His Majesty&apos;s Government are trying to realisein the new World Organisation. The arguments in support of this view are contained in paragraph 5 of the report, sub-paragraphs (a) to (e). In particular,it is pointed out that, in the case of the United States and Russia, geographicalfacts tend to cause them to limit their defence commitments to the immediatevicinity of their territory, whereas the British Empire, being dispersed over theglobe, involves us in commitments in many directions of a nature to strain our resources to breaking-point. It is suggested that it would be to our advantage that other nations, notably the United States, should share in the problems of security and defence in the Middle East generally, and that it might be easier to induce the French and Egyptians to acquiesce in new arrangements for theadministration of the Canal if both its control and its security were declared to be the concern of the United Nations rather than of Great Britain alone.3. I understand that any satisfactory reply to the two questions put by theCommittee must take into account not only our future available resources&quot; butalso world (and in particular United Stales) opinions and tendencies, and mustA.

conform to them if we are not to be faced, later on, with pressure to reverse our policy.   My submission, however, is that both questions must be answered^ in the affirmative, and in endeavouring to justify that submission I shall examine thequestions first of all from the point of view of the Middle East itself and secondlyfrom the broader standpoint of world security into which our Middle Easternarrangements must be fitted.4. The Middle Eastern area (viz. : Egypt, Palestine, Trans Jordan, the levant States, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf), with Egypt and the suez Canal as its core, is the meeting place of two continents and, if Turkey beadded, of three. It is thus one of the most important strategic areas in theworld, and it is an area the defence of which is a matter of life and death tothe British Empire since, as the present war and the war of 1914-18 have bothproved, it is there that the Empire can be cut in half. Consequently, we are bound to give the Middle East an extremely high priority when allotting ouravailable resources to the areas where we have responsibilities. For this reasonalone, we cannot afford to resign our special position in the area (even though in an emergency we may be able to accept the help of others in defending it) and allow our position to be dependent on arrangements of an international character.5. Secondly, the Middle East is the sole really large source of oil outsideAmerica which is available to us. Recent studies indicate that in ten years&apos;time neither the British Empire nor even the United States will be able to exert their full war effort in case of need without the oil supplies of the Iraq-Persian Gulf area.6. There is a further consideration. The quality which the Middle Easternpeoples recognise above all others is strength. If we retained our position thereduring the early part of the present war, it is because the Middle East neverlost confidence in our resolution and in our ultimate ability to win through. Ifonce we go to the lengths of inviting other Powers permanently to share theburden which we have hitherto carried in the Middle East, the countries con-cerned will construe our action not as statesmanship but as abdication : at bestthey would become confused and revert to the game of playing off the Powersagainst each other : at worst they would identify themselves with the interestsof the newcomer whom they conceived to be the strongest. Our present positionwould thereby be forfeited : it is questionable whether it could ever be retrieved.7.   To turn to the more general considerations outlined earlier in thismemorandum, it is true that His Majesty&apos;s Government are pledged to supportthe organisation of security by international co-operation.    But the world organisation, when it comes to devise practical, means of ensuring peace, can scarcely proceed otherwise than by giving one Great Power special defenceresponsibilities in its particular area or areas; and the effectiveness of the world organisation in the last resort in carrying out its decisions will depend on theefficiency of the defence facilities available there to the Great Power concerned.Whether, in a more or less distant future, this principle will give way to a more general sharing of responsibility it is difficult to say.   Our hope and intentionwould be that any provision we made on our own account for the security of theUnited Kingdom and the Commonwealth would, receive the eventual sanction of the World Organisation, by which it would be regarded as a contribution tothe general security, and therefore as an arrangement to be adopted and fittedin to the World Organisation^ security arrangements. But at the present momenteach of the Great Powers is, in fact, in the same position in the areas it considersvital to it as is this country in the Middle East.   The position of the UnitedStates in relation to the Panama Canal is identical with our own in relation to the suez Canal, as is the position of Russia with regard to certain areas of eastern europe,    it is a practical certainty that, at present at any rate, those powers would decline to share their special responsibilities with us (and it would be agrievous drain on our resources to seek to claim a share) and. we are equallyentitled to exclusive facilities (so far as we consider them expedient) in. our ownvital area. I recommend, then, to my colleagues that, pending the establishment ofthe World  Organisation  and its Military Staff  Committee,  His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should secure the vital interests of the British Empire and Common-wealth in the Middle East by their own means.   In so far as this involves treatyarrangements with the nations of the Middle East, I might add that the conclusionof freely negotiated treaties can hardly be challenged as an undemocratic method and that such treaties have brought undeniable benefits to the countries concerned.
8. I do not consider, therefore, that our claim to a predominant role in thedefence and political control of the Middle East is out of harmony with thegeneral international background. But I have one final point to make, namely,that the earliest possible consultation should take place on this subject with theDominions, two of which (Australia and New Zealand) have always shown an acute and highly justifiable interest in the defence of Egypt and the suez canal. Solidarity with the Dominions on this issue would strengthen our position vis-a-vis the United States, and their practical assistance were they disposed to afford it would lessen the strain on our resources, to which the Committee drew attention, which would be imposed by our assuming sole responsibility for security in the Middle Eastern area.
