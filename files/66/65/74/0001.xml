THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.30 4OXSECRET.W.P. (45) 324.2Uh May, 1945.WAR CABINET.HOME SECRETARY&apos;S VISIT TO THE CHANNEL ISLANDS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I think that my colleagues may be interested in the attached account ofthe visit which, accompanied by Lord Munster, I made to the Channel Islandson the 14th and 15th May.&apos; It does not purport to be more than a note of myimpressions on a short visit.As will be seen, on the whole the situation, at least in Jersey and Guernsey,was reassuring, and while, of course, the Germans have left behind them a gooddeal of damage which will have to be put right and the economy of the Islandshas been dislocated, the problem of their rehabilitation should be less difficultthan was to have been expected. Certainly, as far as concerns material damage,the Channel Islands have suffered nothing that compares with the damage dueto enemy air raids in this country, while the health of the population generallydoes not seem to have been seriously impaired.The cordiality of our reception was most moving. The Islanders expressed their appreciation both of the help received from the British Red Cross throughthe agency of the International Red Cross and of the supplies brought by theliberating forces under Brigadier Snow. It was clear thai they understood and approved the policy of withdrawing British troops in 1940 and of refraining from using force to recapture the Islands after D-Day. I was moved by thewarmth and sincerity of the expressions of loyalty to the Crown which I heardand references to the Prime Minister were received with rapturous enthusiasm.Altogether I was much encouraged, and I think that a visit so soon afterliberation by a member of the War Cabinet (or, as the Islanders would preferit put, the member of His Majesty&apos;s Council most closely concerned with channel islands affairs) was appreciated as a sign of the interest taken in their welfarein this country. I felt that the excellent spirit in which I found the Islandersand their gratitude for the assistance already given provided a very good founda-tion for the successful accomplishment of the difficult task of rehabilitation.A number of points on which further aid was asked for are being taken up with the Departments concerned,H.

W. 1,2Uh May, 1945.Copy No.   3 appendix.HOME SECRETARY&apos;S VISIT TO THE CHANNEL ISLANDS,MONDAY, 14th MAY, AND TUESDAY, 15th MAY, 1945.Programme.Accompanied by Lord Munster and officers of the Home Office, I arrivedat Guernsey early on Monday, the 14th May, spent most of Monday at Guernsey,arrived at Jersey in the evening and sailed for England early Tuesday afternoon.On both Islands I met the Bailiffs and other Crown Officers, addressed theStates, and had discussions about the experiences of the Islanders during theoccupation, the problems which face them now, and the ways in which HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos; can best help them to find their feet again. In each caseafter addressing the States I spoke in the public square outside to large andenthusiastic crowds. I had brought with me to Guernsey Major Wallace lePatourel, V.C., a native of the Island, and, as can be imagined, his reception[29960]
was tumultuous. On both Islands i was shown houses and other buddings whichhad been occupied by the Germans. At Guernsey I visited the Gestapo Head-quarters which had felicitously been established at a boarding house named&quot; Mon Plaisir,&quot; and I inspected the civil hospital. On both Islands I was shownsomething of the German fortifications and watched the assembly and embarka-tion of the German garrison. )Time did not permit of a visit to Sark, but I had an opportunity of a talk with the Dame. Nor did I visit Alderney, which had been almost completelyevacuated in 1940.Relations with the Germans during the occupation.I was told that on the whole the behaviour of the Germans had been correct,particularly in the early days. The German Command seems to have beencontent to leave the civil administration in the hands of the civil authorities,subject only to control and directions in matters such as requisitioning ofsupplies and the ban on the use of wireless sets. There was little overt inter-ference with the machinery of civil government, and the States continued tohold their regular meetings.&apos; It was surprising to see that the Royal Arms were still intact over Government buildings. The Bailiffs and other officers who hadto deal officially with the Germans were allowed to speak quite freely, and thoughfrom time to time they were subjected to threats, for example, of deportation toAlclerney in one instance, these were not in fact executed. Early this year,however&apos;, when Vice-Admiral Huffmeier took over the Command from GeneralSchmettow, there was a stiffening of the German attitude, but apparently withouta great deal of difference in the practical outcome. Admiral Huffmeier had beensent to the Islands, it was thought, by Hitler himself with power to supersedeGeneral Schmettow. probably because the latter was thought to have been toolenient in his treatment, of the Islanders, and though General Schmettowostensibly resigned the Command on grounds of health the, truth was probablythat Admiral Huffmeier acted on the authority which he had been given.Everything that I heard led me to the conclusion that the Island officials had discharged their difficult responsibilities during the occupation in exemplaryfashion and had succeeded to a remarkable extent in getting the best possibletreatment from the Germans commensurate with the avoidance of any semblanceof collaboration. In Jersey most of the burden was shouldered by the Bailiff,Mr. A. M. Coutanehe, ably assisted by the Law Officers, Mr. C. W. Duret Dubinand Mr. C. S. Harrison. In Guernsey the Bailiff, Mr. Victor Carey, being anolder man not in particularly good health, had to devolve a good deal of theresponsibility on to others, notably Mr. J. Leale, the Chairman of the ControllingCommittee of the States, Sir Abraham Laine, the Chairman of the Control of essential Commodities Committee, and Mr. -Marteh who acted as Attorney-General after the Attorney-General, Major A. J. Sherwill. M.C., had beendeported in the first of the deportations of 1942. (The Solicitor-General,Mr. S. G. M. Riclgeway, had died early in the war.) In Sark the Dame,Mrs. Hathaway, appears to have remained almost wholly mistress of thesituation. All these officers, I am sure, deserve the highest commendation for the ability with which they carried out their duties under conditions in which it wasimpossible for them to receive instructions from higher authorities beyond those given before the occupation, when it had not been possible to do more than tell them that they must remain at their posts and do the best they could in theinterests of the Islanders.There appears to be no evidence of anything which could be regarded as awar crime as far as the Germans on Jersey and Guernsey were concerned. Thetwo deportations of 1942 and 1943, which involved the removal of more than2,000 men of United Kingdom origin, were not the responsibility of the occupying forces. We were told nothing of the alleged atrocities on Alderney.These are, however, being thoroughly investigated.At a lower level the discipline seems to have been strict, and the conduct ofthe troops, with few exceptions, correct until the past few months, when theshortage of food and fuel has led to a great increase in the thefts by the troops.This, however, was paralleled by a similar increase in thefts by the civilian population. Cases of violence do not seem to have been numerous. In Guernsey,for example, there was only one case of rape; this was in the early days. the offender was condemned to death, and there is no reason to doubt that theexecution was carried out.On the other hand, the Germans left many of the premises they occupied ina disgracefully filthy condition, and in some cases houses had been stripped forfiring.   I saw one house which had been used for keeping rabbits and was in a
particularly objectionable state. No doubt for military reasons the Germansalso did considerable damage to the sea walls and slips, and while to some extenttheir military works may prove to be assets, e.g., the improvement of roads and theextensions to the airports, the Islands are cluttered with fortifications and otherstructures with no peace-time use.The Germans had with them a large number of foreign workers, russians and others, belonging to the Todt organisation, whose habits and standards are said to have been low, and we heard a number of comments on the brutal treat-ment which they had at the hands of the Germans. This also applied to Germandefaulters.As regards the Islanders themselves, with very few exceptions, their conductseems to have been exemplary. We were told of no cases of collaboration involvingactive disloyalty. On the other hand, there were a certain number of women who consorted with the Germans, and the Germans were able to induce Islandlabour to work for them by offering very much higher wages than the Islandauthorities could pay. The labourers, it was said, justified their conduct to themselves on the ground that the fortifications which they built were futileand would not seriously impede a British assault, while the economic pressure upon them was, of course, extremely heavy.   There were, too, a few informers.A more serious problem was presented by the Eire citizens in the Islands.Many of these looked upon themselves as neutrals and sought to obtain fromthe Germans more favourable treatment on this ground. In particular, as&apos;&apos; neutrals &apos;&apos; they succeeded in gaining exemption from the deportations, andmost of the Irish labourers had no compunction about working for the Germans.It is gratifying, however, that the Island authorities were able to turn the tableson them by arguing successfully with the International Red Cross representa-tives that if they were neutrals the Irish were not entitled to be included inthe list of persons to be repatriated on the Vega because of sickness.Condition of the Islanders.The spirit of the Islanders was magnificent and though, when I was there,it was nearly a week since VE-day, the joy of the population was still extreme.As several people told me, even yet they could hardly grasp the reality of liberation, and they felt as if they had just awakened from a nightmare.On both Islands I explained in my speeches and in private conversationwhy we had to withdraw the British forces in 1940 and why we refrained fromrecapturing the Islands by force after D-day in order to save them from thedestruction which any such an assault would have entailed. These explanationswere well received, and I was gratified to find little or no evidence of a feeling that we had not helped the Islands to the full. 1 was told that at times duringthe occupation the Islanders did feel their isolation keenly and were tempted to think that the British Government and people had forgotten them, but the arrival of the Red Cross supplies in the nick of time and the aid brought bythe liberating forces seem to have entirely dispelled this sentiment.It is, I think, to the credit of the Islanders that, despite all they went through(and nobody who has not lived under the Nazis can realise fully what this means)and despite their isolation, they should have kept their sense of balance so well,but inevitably they lost touch with events in the outside world, their information about which came in the main from what they were able to pick up from theirillicit wireless sets and from enemy news services. Before D-day it was notat all easy to pick up British stations on the improvised sets which the Islandersconstructed, but later the power of the British services was increased and recep-tion was much better. The Islanders admitted that they were ill-informed aboutmany matters which we should completely take for granted, and it was clear from conversation that, though they did their best, they really had little coin-prehension of conditions in this country, including the bombing and war-timeprivations. But they are very anxious to bring themselves up to date as soonas possible, and I promised them that through the Ministry of Informationwe would do our utmost to help.Health and Physique.By and large the Islanders looked well, if thin, and I was particularlypleased to see how well the children looked. This impression was confirmed bythe doctors to whom I spoke. They said that the health of the Islands was oil the whole fairly good, though there had been ia marked deterioration during thelast month or two owing to the food shortage. It had, however, been possible tomaintain regular supplies of milk for young children and expectant mothers.There had been a certain increase in tuberculosis, but no serious epidemics
throughout the occupation. There had been little venereal disease; the Germanpractice of ordering compulsory confinement till the patient was certified freejiacl contributed to this state of affairs.The most serious threat to the health of the Islanders had, of course, beenthe food shortage. As far as we could judge, things had not been really badbefore the Islands were cut oh after D-Day. They then gradually deteriorated,and we were told on several occasions that but for the Red Cross supplies the islands would by now have been reduced to starvation. The Germans had suffered worse even than the Islanders, but they did not attempt to divert theReel Cross supplies to their own use. In some cases they were reduced to eatingcats and dogs, and dandelions and stinging-nettle soup were amongst their stapleitems of diet. The diet of the Toclt organisation workers was particularly bad.In the German military hospitals there were a number of cases of seriousmalnutrition.The main food shortages were in flour and meat, and as regards the latterit &quot;is interesting to record that the Germans opposed a proposal to slaughter theherds on the ground that their use for milk production would be more economical in tire long run. But the shortages, of course, extended to practicallyevery commodity, not the least of the Islands&apos; privations being due to the sus-pension of brewing in the latter part of the occupation. Island tobacco though,of course, immature and imperfectly cured, sold on the black market at pricesof the order of 30s. an ounce.Fuel.Second only in gravity to the food shortage was the fuel position. As the relatively small stocks in the Islands at D-Day were drawn upon, the germans and the population were reduced to the direst straits. By the end the gassupplies were entirely cut off and electricity could only be used for hospitals andother emergency purposes. Communal cooking was practised extensively, bathswere at a premium, and for heating during a particularly hard winter theIslanders had to scrape together anything which they could use for firewood. Itis not surprising that under these conditions some of the empty houses werestripped almost bare of their wood-work and in other cases furniture was used as fuel.Agriculture.Much naturally will need to be done before the agriculture and horticulture,so important to the Islands, can regain their former efficiency and prosperity.There has been a serious shortage of fertilisers, fungicides and animal feeding-stuffs. The repair and replacement of agricultural machinery and equipmentpresented a difficult problem. Yet the famous herds are still intact, and we were told at Guernsey that although owing to requisitions the herd had fallen from ,200-2,800 cows before the occupation to about 2,000 now, the Islanders hadbeen left to do theii own culling and in the upshot the quality of the herd was probably better than it had been before the war. Similarly we were assured that the greenhouses were largely undamaged.Holiday Travel.The Islanders to whom we spoke seemed to be reconciled to the inevitabledelay before the holiday trade could be resumed and most of them did not expect that it would be possible to reopen it this summer.The Military Government.The Royal Proclamation which was publicly read by Brigadier Snow after he took over the Islands assured the Islanders that the military governmentwould be brought to an end as soon as possible and that then the full constitutionalliberties and privileges of the Islanders would be restored. I repeated this assurance, but it was clear that the Islands&apos; authorities recognised the needfor a period of military government and, indeed, welcomed it for the time being.Brigadier Snow and the Civil Affairs Officers had evidently already establishedgood relations with the Bailiffs and the other Crown Officers, and BrigadierSnow had wisely emphasised that his main desire was to work through them withthe minimum of interference.While we were there the enemy were still being rounded up, a task whichwas being speedily carried out, and we saw large numbers of German prisonersbeing embarked for England. Others had been set to work on the removal of enemy mines. The condition of the enemy troops appeared to be poor and theirdemeanour cowed and apathetic.
