THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945./ Copy NoVWAR CABINET.POLICY IN BURMA.Report by the India Committee.AT their meeting on the 4th December, 1944 (W.M. (44) 161st Conclusions,Minute 9), the War Cabinet invited us to consider the general issue of policy in burma and to report to the War Cabinet. We have since considered this matter in detail and, after discussion with the Governor of Burma, we make therecommendations which follow.SECRET.W.P. (45) 275.1st May, 1945.Commitments.2. In the Appendix to this paper we record the more recent commitmentsmade to Burma in the constitutional field. The effect, as will be seen, is thatwe are committed to the principle of complete self-government for Burma in theBritish Commonwealth as soon as circumstances permit. We have also stated,before the entry of Japan into the war, that once the war has been won, therewould be discussions &quot; which will clear the Avay towards the achievement byBurma&quot; of Dominion status.Present Position.3. Burma has been in enemy occupation in greater or less degree since may 1942. The normal operation of the Constitution provided by the Governmentof Burma Act, 1935, has been suspended since the 10th December, 1942, and thesanction for acts taken by the exiled Government of Burma has rested on a proclamation issued under the Emergency Provisions (Section 139) of that Actwhich enable the Governor, when satisfied that a situation has arisen in whichthe Government of Burma cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisionsof the Act, to assume all necessary powers under the Act to himself.4. The Emergency Provisions in question are limited by statute to amaximum period of three years, which will expire in December 1945, and duringwhich Parliamentary approval for the continuance of proclamations under thesection is necessary at stated intervals. The next of these intervals expires inJune, 1945, when Parliamentary approval for the continuance of the existingproclamation will have to be sought. If the emergency power is to be kept in being after December 1945 it will be necessary to obtain express parliamentary sanction to this.5. There have been signs of growing interest both in Parliament and inthe Press in the future of Burma. That interest is likely to be intensified withthe liberation of the country -in the near future. Some statement of policy willbe called for both to satisfy Parliament and the Press when the Secretary ofState for Burma asks in June for the extension of the Section 139 proclamationand for use, on the liberation of Rangoon, in connection with the liberation of burma from the Japanese.[29801] b
Problems.6.   There are two problems for solution the immediate and the long-term.7.   The periods for which provision has to be made are : (a) the military period;(b) the period of direct rule which the Cabinet have agreed shall follow themilitary period;(c) the transitional period which will follow on the period of direct rule and which will lead up to the achievement by Burma of full self-government.8. We deal with these periods and with the policy to be adopted in regardto them below.Military Period.9. The military period will last until the Supreme Commander is satisfiedthat security has been established against external enemies, and that a sufficientdegree of internal order and of transport have been re-established. During thisperiod responsibility will rest with the Supreme Commander working through his Civil Affairs staff.Period of Direct Rule.10. At their meeting on the 14th April, 1943 (W.M. (43) 54th Conclusions,Minute 3), the War Cabinet agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government would haveto resort to a system of direct rule during the reconstruction of Burma. Duringsuch a period the government would be by the Governor, subject to control and direction by the Secretary of State for Burma. The legal basis of theGovernor&apos;s position would continue to be the Emergency Provisions (Section 139)of the Government of Burma Act, 1935.11. The case for a period of autocratic rule following on the liberation of burma is no less strong than it was in 1943. A single and undivided control,backed by an efficient official machine, will be required to handle the difficult problems of reconstruction. There are. in any event, practical difficulties in theway of holding elections, convening the legislature or governing Burma underthe normal constitution of 1935 for some considerable time. Finally, for someyears, Burma, until her own resources are re-established, will be dependent, ina greater or less degree, on financial assistance from His Majesty&apos;s Governmentfor carrying on her Government, and so long as that is the case special provision will have to be made for the control of such expenditure and the ultimate rep ay-ment of any advances made.12. We can form no firm estimate at this stage of the length of the period for which autocratic rule will be necessary. At one time the Governor was disposed to think that it might be as long as seven years. That may well be so. But theGovernor agrees with us that it would be politically difficult to announce in terms(even if we had material to justify doing so) that autocratic control would infact last for so long.13. At the same time it will be necessary both to give some preliminaryindication of the period for which it might be needed, and to obtain Parliamentaryauthority for the continued application during it of the Emergency Provisionsof the Act. We suggest, in these circumstances, with the Governors full support,that Parliament be invited to authorise the operation of the Emergency Pro-visions of the Act for a further period of three years from&apos; their present expiryin December 1945. It may be that it will be possible to dispense with them before that date. It is ait least equally possible that their employment mayhave to be extended, with the approval of Parliament, for a substantial further period. That must turn on the conditions we find in Burma on its liberationand on the progress of reconstruction. We think it unnecessary for the moment to look beyond December 1948.14.. We are conscious of the damaging publicity which could be given byinterested parties to the maintenance of an autocratic control even for so short a period as three years, and of the misunderstandings that might arise on thispoint. We think, and the Governor agrees, that in these circumstances, Parlia-ment should be asked to authorise the taking of powers which will enable theGovernor, with the approval of the Secretary of State, and subject to affirmative resolution in Parliament, to liberalise Section 139 as, for example, by setting up
4 4 O1an Executive Council, and, if circumstances make that desirable, convening somead interim legislative body, while retaining over-all powers of control himself,and remaining independent of such legislative body. Such an arrangement wouldbe of value in Burma, in this country, and internationally, as indicating ouranxiety to qualify purely autocratic rule so far as possible. It might also givethe opportunity to test out methods of constitutional development and progressalternative to the constitution based on the British model which at presentregulates the affairs of Burma.15. The Secretary of State for. Burma will, in any event, have to seekParliamentary approval before the 10th June next to the extension of the currency of the existing proclamation under Section 139 until December 1945. We recom-mend that he be authorised at the same time to seek Parliamentary approval to theemployment of that Section if necessary for a further period of three years from december 1945 and to take power to liberalise its operation on the lines that wehave indicated. If the War Cabinet approve this recommendation the draft ofa Bill would be sent to the Legislation Committee.Position on the conclusion of the period of direct rule.16. We now examine the position on the conclusion of the period of directrule under the provisions of Section 139 of the Act&quot; of 1935. Those provisions are-strictly limited in their operation to a situation &quot; in which the Governmentof Burma cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the act of 1935.&quot; Once such conditions are re-established the Act of 1935 should comeinto full -force, failing legislation to provide an alternative. There is clearadvantage in this.. While the Act of 1935 may not be the ideal solution for theproblems of Burma, it has been tested, and has stood up reasonably well, overthe period from 1937-42. It will take time to devise any effective alternative to it. It is important that Burma, and opinion generally, should be reassuredthat there is no intention of maintaining indefinitely an autocratic system ofcontrol. We recommend accordingly that in any statement there is to be madeemphasis should be laid on the fact that as soon as conditions permit of thewithdrawal of the proclamations under Section 139 and of the normal operationof the constitution, the constitution of 1935 will be revived, subject to theadoption of any modifications found to be acceptable by Burmese opinion, until such date as it may be replaced by a new constitution perhaps of a different typeaccepted by representative Burmese opinion.The Long-Term^ Problem.17. The recommendations which we have made in the preceding paragraphs of this report deal with the immediate problem. We now proceed to examine thelong-term problem.18. As already explained, we are committed to self-government for Burmaas our goal. We have not so far defined what conditions must be satisfied byBurma before she achieves that goal. But it goes without saying that there mustbe a sufficient degree of support from the various elements in Burma&apos;s national life for any new form of government that may be proposed in substitution forthe existing constitution; that the requisite machinery to enable such a Govern-ment to function must have been devised; and, finally, that arrangements,whether by treaty or otherwise, must have been made with His Majesty;s Govern-ment of such a character as will safeguard the financial advances which we mayhave made to Burma and protect the other continuing interests of the UnitedKingdom and the Empire in that country. The argument for these pre-conditions is obvious, but they have never been publicly stated. The Governor would seeadvantage in taking the opportunity of any statement of policy now to be madein connection with the liberation of Burma to state them positively, but would wish that it should be stated equally positively that once they are fulfilled, Burmawill have self-government.19. We have found great difficulty in reaching a firm conclusion at thisstage as to the type of constitution that a self-governing Burma will ultimatelywish to establish. Some of us feel indeed grave doubt as to Burma&apos;s capacity for self-government of any kind. But we accept that the commitments which havebeen entered into have pre-judged that issue, and we should not be justified, onthe evidence before us, in holding that Burma&apos;s incapacity is in fact proved. we doubt very much the suitability of our own Parliamentary democratic institu-tions for a country such as Burma, and we think that there might well be advantage in an arrangement corresponding more closelv with the swiss model[29801] b2
under which there would be an executive appointed for a given number of years,and responsive to, but not controlled by a legislature. We made no attempt,however, to examine this matter more closely. It would, in our view, be premature-ture to plan until we know more of conditions inside the country and of the stateof pxiblic opinion in Burma. In these circumstances, we can make no firmrecommendation to. the War Cabinet as to the nature of the ultimate BurmeseConstitution that should be aimed at.20. As regards the proposals of the Governor, we realise his anxiety thatany statement now made with the authority of His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldbe as convincing, and should appear to be as far reaching as possible. We readilyagree that any such statement now to be made should repeat and reaffirm the pledges already given by us as to our intention to see Burma attain self-govern-ment within the Empire.21. We would be very ready, also, to see a reaffirrnation of our intention, atthe appropriate moment, to enter into discussion with representatives of Burmaon the form of further constitutional advance in that country, though we feelthat a first essential will be the restoration of normal conditions. Finally, while there may be room for doubt as to the wisdom of stating in precise detail atthis stage the conditions to be satisfied by Burma before she attains self-govern-ment, we accept the Governor&apos;s view that it would be well to indicate that essen-tial pr-e-conditions will be that Burma should be agreed as to the form of her future constitution; that there should be the machinery necessary for self-govern-ment; and that the necessary arrangements should have been concluded by treaty or otherwise with His Majesty&apos;s Government.Scheduled A reas.22. We consider that when self-government is established in Burma proper,the administration of the Scheduled Areas, i.e.. the Shan States and the tribaltracts on the mountainous fringes of the country, inhabited by non-Burmanpeoples, who are behind the Burmese in political development, should remain forthe time being the responsibiity of His Majesty&apos;s Government, until such time as their inhabitants signify their desire for some suitable form of amalgamationwith Burma proper.Financial A rrangements.23. For some considerable time after her liberation Burma will requirefinancial assistance from outside to enable government to be carried on and hereconomy to be re-established. There have been discussions on this subject betweenthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Burma and theGovernor of Burma. We need not trouble the War Cabinet with their outcome,save to say that arrangements are being made for certain advances to Burma ona strictly austerity basis and for a limited period, subject to safeguards for theImperial Exchequer which the Chancellor of the Exchequer accepts as adequate.We would only comment that, as we have already stated, so long as Burma is dependent for subventions on the Exchequer, and there are outstanding for repay-ment advances made by the Imperial Exchequer, a sufficient control to safeguard the financial position of this country will be called for.Statement by the Secretary of State.24. If the War Cabinet accept the recommendations contained in our Report,we recommend that the Secretary of State for Burma be authorised to make anannouncement regarding them in the Debate on the extension of the Section 139Proclamations at the beginning of June. Any such statement will be of much importance, and it will be desirable that it should be in precise and carefullyguarded terms. For this reason we think that its terms should be approved bythe War Cabinet.Summary of Recommendations.25.   We summarise our recommendations as follows : (a) The Secretary of  State  for Burma  should be   authorised  to  seekParliamentary approval in June for a further extension of theexisting operation of Section 139 of the Government of Burma Actup to December 1945, and(b) simultaneously to seek Parliamentary approval for a fresh operation ofthat Section as may be necessary for a further period not exceeding three years up to December 1948.
(c) In doing so he should seek power to liberalise the operation of the section on the lines indicated in paragraph 14 above.(d) Any commitment as to whether the period of direct rule should expirebefore or after December 1948 should be avoided, as should any commitment as regards our future timetable, on the express groundthat it is impossible until Burma has been liberated, stock has beentaken of conditions there, and the progress of reconstruction is underway, to speak with confidence on this matter.(e) On the expiry of the period of direct rule under Section 139 the normaloperation of the Government of Burma Act, 1935, should be resumeduntil such period as it is replaced by a constitution of a different character.(/) The Scheduled Areas should remain a responsibility of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment until such time as their inhabitants signify their desire for some suitable form of amalgamation with Burma proper.(g) At the appropriate moment the discussions with the representatives of burma which were promised in 1941 should be undertaken.(A) A statement, to be approved by the War Cabinet, (which couldsubsequently be used locally in Burma and by the Supreme Com-mander) should be made by the Secretary of State for Burma in the debate on the extension of the Section 139 Proclamations in Juneof our intentions as regards future policy in Burma, or included inany White Paper that may be.issued in that connection.SIMON, Acting Chairman(on behalf of the Committee).30th April, 1945.APPENDIX.Summary of the More Important Recent Commitments to Burma in theConstitutional Field.THE Governor on the 24th November, 1939, stated that in the judgment ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; the natural issue of Burma&apos;s constitutional progressthrough the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view tothe progressive realisation of responsible Government in Burma is the attainment of Dominion status.&quot;2. On the 15th February, 1940, the Governor repeated this announcementand made it clear that &quot; Dominion status &quot; was &quot; the accepted goal for consti-tutional advance in Burma.&quot;3. On the 2nd July, 1940, the Governor stated that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would &apos;&apos; continue to use their best endeavours to promote the attainment ofDominion status as being the objective of Burma&apos;s constitutional progress.&quot;4. On the 26th August, 1940, the Governor repeated that his statement ofthe 2nd July &quot; makes it clear beyond a shadow of doubt that full self-government, which is the essence of Dominion status, is the goal for Burma&quot;and further &quot; that immediately the war is brought to a victorious end HisMajesty&apos;s Government will be willing to discuss the problems to be solved in burma,&quot; and that &quot;when the war has been won discussions will be undertakenwhich will clear the way towards the attainment by Burma of &apos;&apos; the status &apos;&apos; ofa Dominion within the Commonwealth of the British Empire.&quot;5. On the 3rd November, 1941, the Secretary of State for Burma, in aletter to U. Saw, which has not been published, reiterated these declarations. he added that the promised discussion of the problems to be solved in Burma wouldbe &quot;conducted in collaboration with representatives of Burma&quot; and would be designed to remove &apos;&apos; to the fullest extent that may be found practicable suchlimitations as stand in the way of the assumption by the people of Burma of complete self-government within the British Commonwealth.&quot;6. On the 18th April, 1943, the Secretary of State for Burma, m replyto a question by Mr. Sorensen, said that &quot; the aim of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis to assist Burma to attain complete self-government within the British Common-wealth as soon as circumstances permit.&quot;
