naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   A Japanese heavy cruiser has been sunk by H.M. destroyers off Penang.Ships and aircraft of the East Indies Eleet have attacked enemy positions in the Andamans.Of the U-boats at sea 33 have so far surrendered.Discharges through Channel Ports.2. During the week ending the 14th the combined British and U.S.discharges through the ports of Antwerp, Ostend, Calais, Ghent, Boulogne, Caen,Cherbourg, Havre and Rouen were approximately 71,500 men, 4,800 vehicles,278,750 tons of stores, 24,000 tons of coal, 88.350 tons of oil and 7,325 tons ofammunition.Norwegian and Danish Ports.3. H.M. ships Devonshire (cruiser), A f olio, Ariadne (fast minelayers) and four destroyers reached Oslo on the 13th; H.R.H, the Crown Prince Olaf tookpassage with the force and disembarked at Oslo. The flag of Flag Officer,Norway, was hoisted at Oslo at 0800 on the 14th. Destroyers had sailed fromScapa &quot;on the previous clay, carrying naval parties for Trondheim, Bergen,Stavanger and Kristiansand (south). A first report from Bergen and Frederikstadstates that the ports are intact.It is reported from Copenhagen that the ships now alongside in the portare housing in all some 8,900 refugees, 4,800 wounded (of whom 2,200 are seriously wounded) and 8,650 unwounded troops. In addition an unknownnumber of ships is lying off the port.Allied convoys of troops, cargoes and stores have reached Stavanger,Kristiansand (south) and Oslo.German Ports.4.   The Kiel Canal is now open.During the night of 10th/11th seven German destroyers and four torpedo-boats entered Kiel and were disarmed. Each ship had on board an average of1,600 troops and refugees. After these had been disembarked, the ships wereberthed in Tirpitzhafen with armed guards provided by the Royal Marines.In one case these guards prevented a destroyer from being scuttled. It was reported late on the 14th that over 250 ships and craft were in the port, mostlylaclen with troops and refugees. It is hoped to disperse these refugees at therate of 20,000 a day; but the state of the port (water, lighting and sewage systemsare negligible) does not permit of the easy manoeuvring of large crowds.5. At Wilhelmshaven all the 24 U-boats in the port had been scuttled; buta torpedo-boat was found in a floating dock and one sperrbrecher and 12 largeminesweepers are available for sweeping; some 120 small fishing craft are being-converted from minesweeping to fishing. A 2,000-ton coaster was the onlyseaworthy cargo ship in the port. The harbour of Wilhelmshaven is entirelyenclosed, and entrance is effected by way of locks; all of-these appear to be intact.H.M. minesweepers entered Hamburg harbour on the 12th, having worked their way up from Cuxhaven since the 9th. The first Allied convoy, of 14 ships, has reached Cuxhaven.6. In the Fehmarn island area six minesweepers were found ready for service.   In addition there were a small coastal tanker and over 40 minor craft.7. At Flensburg all but two of the 157 ships and craft in the harbour areimmobile for lack of fuel. Two cable ships were found, and German reports statethat there are also a destroyer, a torpedo boat, 25 minesweepers, 20 R-boats,possibly three U-boats, and an unknown number of E-boats in the port. Some20,000 German naval ratings and a larger number of troops are on shore, and ships in the harbour are housing 2,200 wounded and 1,000 refugees.8. At Brunsbuttel the port and its lock gates were found in good state.Examination located an old immobile A.A. cruiser, a U-boat depot ship, a destroyer, an incomplete U-boat, four torpedo boats, three minesweepers, two -boats and 50 landing craft of various types.
9. At Emden all port facilities are now available to ships of 25-feet draught;and the handling capacity of the port is limited only by the present difficultyof transport to and from the port.Heligoland.10. On the 11th Flag Officer, Wilhelmshaven. proceeded to Heligolandescorted by ships of the ,7th German minesweeping flotilla, with a company ofScots Guards on board. The island was then formally taken over. In the harbourwere seven German U-boats, all fit to sail. The town of Heligoland had been completely destroyed, but the power-station was still working and two heavy gunsand two A.A. batteries could still fire. The garrison originally numbered 6,000,but of these, 3,500 were evacuated after the last Allied air raid. Two thousandfive hundred remained, and of these all but 300 were evacuated on the 11th.Dutch Ports.11. According to reports from Rotterdam, 5,000 tons daily can be unloadedthere at present, and this figure will shortly be doubled. The German warshipscaptured in the port comprise three R-boats, an E-boat depot ship, six auxiliaryM/S trawlers and their depot ship, four armed barges and two ferries.12. No full survey of the Dutch ports has yet been completed, but thereis every indication of a large number of minor warships and craft; the dutch coast was in effect the last citadel of offensive activity by surface craft of theGerman Navy, and this had continued almost up to the last hours of hostilities.It was also the chief centre of activity by small battle-units; and at Lynaes, onthe north coast of Zeeland, no fewer than 90 midget U-boats have been located,complete with crews and equipment. On the 14th the N.O.I.C., Ijmuiden,&quot; reported(bat the following German naval ships and craft were in the harbour : 11 mine-sweepers, 12 patrol boats and other harbour craft. 24 Seehund-type midgets and six barges loaded with a total of 394 mines of various types. Ijmuiden is notyet open to shipping : the locks leading to the North Sea Canal are undamaged,but need to be worked by hand.13. At Amsterdam, which is not yet open to shipping, two blockships in theNorth Sea Canal limit the approach to a passage twenty feet wide and six feetdeep. The Petroleum Haven and its cisterns have been demolished, but all other facilities, including cranes, are intact. The Naval yard is in working order.There are three small naval craft and some 50,000 tons of inland water craft inthe harbour.14. The German Rhine flotilla consisting of 64 craft and some 700 officersand men surrendered on the 14th and have been ordered to Rotterdam.French Ports.15. On the 8th a U.S. naval party entered La Rochelle in company with french naval personnel. Early on the 9th the surrender of the He de Re wasreceived and the island was inspected. No damage was found to have been done to any of the military installations; A.A. and coastal batteries, radar and radioinstallations and the telephone system were all in excellent state. At La Pallice adismantled French light cruiser was found inside the port, as were two patrol craft, ten armed and five dismantled trawlers, one armed minesweeper, two bargesarmed with torpedoes, five tugs, an armed cargo ship, three dismantled cargo ships, a dismantled coaster, a barge and a small U-boat hull. One tanker was found inside the U-boat pen, together with a cargo ship, a dismantled U-boat,a minelayer and six small craft. Both La Rochelle and La Pallice are considered as operational ports; machinery and supplies in the workshop and supply depotswere found intact.16. At Saint Nazaire the position is also satisfactory. French naval forces occupied the port on the 11th and found no serious demolition of ships orinstallations. The following ships were found afloat: a 9,000-ton tanker, a3,000-ton cargo ship, a 4,000-ton armed cargo ship, four coasters, 17 mine-sweepers, three French M.T.Bs., three floating cranes, two floating docks, eighttugs, a hospital ship and several fishing boats and small craft.17.   At Bayonne the entrance channel will allow ships of up to 5,000 tons to pass, and in the harbour 15 quayside berths of decent size are available.[29914] B
18. At Lorient the town is completely destroyed and the port is considered to be of no value to shipping. The quay walls are mainly intact, however; thethree dry clocks seem in good condition and the U-boat pens are intact. One oldtype U-boat and one damaged U-boat were found in the harbour, together with13 serviceable and one damaged minesweeper, 15 tugs (of which three areoperational) and a number of barges and lighters.19. At Bordeaux the port facilities are reported to be nearly intact. As aresult of the sinking of blockships, however, ships of only 320 feet length and18 feet draught can at present be accepted. A sunken destroyer, which blocksthe largest of the three dry clocks, is being cleared and minesweeping has begun in the Gironde approaches! In all some 15,000 feet of quayside are available, andthere are 136 cranes of up to 250 tons, two floating cranes and ten tugs. Of the lesser ports in this area, Le Verdon is completely destroyed, Blaye has at present390 feet of quayside and will ultimately have 900 feet, and Bee d&apos;Ambes, the petroleum station, has storage for 30,000 &quot;cubic metres of liquid fuel. At Pauillacall port facilities are destroyed.The Channel Islands.20. On the 11th and 12th landing ships and craft left Plymouth for therelief of the islands, and by the 13th, unloading and storing in the ports of the islands were well advanced. All coasters had been berthed, and at Guernsey theunloading of coal had started. At St. Peter Port facilities are adequate. a medical report states that although the food situation had been bad, malnutritionin general is not severe. Harbour installations and shipping in the island werenot damaged by the occupying authorities. The Home Secretary has visitedJersey and returned on the 15th in HALS. Impulsive (destroyer).Mediterranean.21. As a result of minesweeping operations off Genoa, landing crafthave been able to unload on the beaches east of the port.H.M. ships Orion (cruiser) and Lauderdale (destroyer) arrived at Triesteon the 11th.About 25 enemy craft were found beached at the mouth of the TagliamentoRiver in the Gulf of Trieste.East Indies.22. On the 6th a force consisting of HALS. Queen Elizabeth, the Frenchbattleship Richelieu, H.M. ships Cumberland, Ceylon and Suffolk (cruisers), theDutch cruiser Tromp arid H.M. ships Shah and Empress (carriers) escorted byfive destroyers bombarded the A.A. defences at Port Blair in the Andamans, after which carrier-borne aircraft set fire to the jetty and two small ships in the harbour.   On the following day naval aircraft attacked Car Nieobar airfield.On the 5th and 6th naval aircraft from HAL ships Hunter, Stalker, Khediveand Emperor (carriers) supported by HALS. Royalist (cruiser) attacked targets in South Burma between Mergui and Victoria Point.23. On the 15th a Nachi-class 8&quot; cruiser (10,000 tons) and one destroyerwere sighted and attacked by naval aircraft north of the Malacca Strait. later the enemy cruiser was intercepted and sunk by H.M. destroyers Saumarez, Venus,Virago, Vigilant and Verulam southwest of Penang. Saumarez had one boilerroom put out of action; no other damage was sustained by the destroyers.24. On the 8th HALS. Silvio (infantry landing ship) was damaged by a mine off Rangoon.Pacific.25. Aircraft of the U.S. and British Pacific Fleets have continued their operations against enemy airfields in the Ryukyus. Enemy counter-attacks,mostly by suicide aircraft, have resulted in heavy losses to the enemy.During attacks by British carrier-borne aircraft on Miyako and IshigakiIslands in the Sakishima group H.M. ships Victorious and Formidable (fleetcarriers) were damaged on the 9th. On the 12th and 13th these attacks were continued but no enemy opposition was encountered; three of our aircraft were shot down.
26. The capture of the oilfields on Tarakan will be very valuable to our forces; this advance source of bunker fuel will save the hitherto long haulagein tankers. Although the enemy has destroyed a large quantity of equipment,no permanent damage can be done, as these oilfields consist entirely of shallowwells with oil only a few feet below sea level. It is reported that the restorationwill be undertaken by Dutch engineers using TJ.S. machinery.27. On the 12th enemy positions near Wewak (New Guinea) were shelledby a cruiser and destroyer in support of land operations.Naval aircraft sank a small cargo ship at Truk in the Carolines.28.   A British submarine has sunk an enemy tanker in the Gulf of Siam.U-Boats.29. A considerable proportion of the TJ-boats which were at sea at thelime of the German surrender have now surfaced in order to give themselves up.By the morning of the 17th 33 boats bad reported their positions in compliance with the surrender terms. Of these 20 had reached harbours in the UnitedKingdom, two were in Gibraltar, two in Canadian ports, two in U.S. ports,one at Frederikshaven, one at Stavanger and one near Sylt. Four surrenderedboats are still at sea, and there may be between 25 and 30 boats which are at sea and have not surrendered. In many cases these latter may not yet have receivedthe news of the surrender. On the 16th the Norwegian destroyer Stofd, withFI.M. destroyer Broadway, met in Vestfiord a convoy of 14 U-boats, three depot-ships and three cargo ships, of which one was the s.s. Stella Polaris (5,020 tons).These ships claimed to be on their way from Narvik to Trondheim, but H.M. ships are now escorting the U-boats to a United Kingdom port. One U-boat whichlias arrived in the United Kingdom is a store-carrier from Japan with a cargoincluding 110 tons of tin, 601 tons of rubber, eight tons of wolfram, half a ton of quinine and five tons of molybdenum.Allied Mines weeping.30. The task of the Mines weeping Forces this week in opening up newroutes to the Continent has been very heavy, but few mines have been swept.Charts and navigational data of the enemy defensive and offensive minelayswhich have been handed over show where mine concentrations can be avoidedin establishing traffic routes; essential waters can, therefore, be opened upaccording to priority requirements.After concentrated sweeping the first searched channel across the North Sea,from the Humber to Heligoland Bight, was brought into use on the 10th.A safe channel has been opened up for shipping destined for Hamburg, anda M/S flotilla has entered Hamburg.During the search of a passage through the Skaggerak on the night of the8th/9th, 11 mines were destroyed.A mine clearance has been started near the channels to the Hook andIjmuiden. .Mine clearance of the inland waterways to Dordrecht is being carried out and three ground mines have been destroyed in the Maas River.Searched channels have been established between Guernsey, Jersey andAlderney.M e dit e r r an e an.31. As a result of the German surrender details of mine clearance in theGulf of Genoa, North Adriatic and the JEgean are becoming available.Since the capture of Trieste three M/S flotillas have been sweeping theAncona-Trieste channel. Twenty-six moored mines were destroyed. Two mines were destroyed off Porto Corsini, ten in the Gulf of Quarnero and 53 during the clearance of a wide channel in the Bay of Navarin.In the ^aegean a clearance was made in the dangerous area off Herakleion,Crete, and eight mines were destroyed. Twelve were destroyed in the Gulf ofAthens and one off Salonika.The mine totals are 6,579 ground and 9,951 moored.Ex-German Merchant Shipping.32. A pool of 2,000 merchant seamen has been formed in the UnitedKingdom for the maintenance of ex-German merchant shipping.   These men are[29914] &quot; B 2
to prepare the ships for sailing so that they may be used for transport, if required,at short notice.A naval party which went to the Kiel area after the surrender reported that three liners had been turned into concentration camps for political prisoners.Two of the ships, the Deutschland (21,046 tons), and the Cap Arcona (27,561 tons),were sunk off Neustadt in the Allied air attack on the 6th, and the third wasbeached after the prisoners on board had mutinied. All the ex-German cargo ships at Hamburg have now been totally disarmed and all scuttling chargesremoved.Nine cargo ships and tankers totalling some 20,000 tons are at present in spanish ports.MILITARY SITUATIONNorway.33. The Allied occupation of Norway has continued without incident, andon the 11th representatives of the German Navy, Army and Air Force arrivedat Edinburgh to receive detailed instructions for the surrender of the german armed forces in Norway. Further British troops were flown into Oslo andStavanger during the ilth-15th and elements of this force have occupiedKristiansand.Norwegian Police troops have arrived in Trondheim, Narvik and Bergen,and the withdrawal of German troops from the towns to concentration areas is proceeding smoothly.Italy, Austria and Yenezia Giulia.34. During the last week, the Eighth Army have been pushing on into South-Eastern Austria, where they have linked with Russian and Bulgarian troops.In Venezia Giulia, the situation is unchanged, while the dispute as to theoccupation of the Province is being handled through diplomatic channels.On the evening of the 9th, British armoured elements made contact withelements of Marshal Tolbukhin&apos;s forces at Voitsberg. By the 13th, british infantry had moved up to the Selzthal area, where they made touch withforces of the U.S. Seventh Army and had made contact with troops of the FirstBulgarian Army on the Austrian-Jugoslav border, west of Maribor. Arrange-ments have now been made whereby a temporary military boundary between the15th Army Group forces, Bulgarian forces, and Russian forces has been laiddown. This runs, reading from north to south, from Selzthal (inclusive to theRussians) to Seltveg (exclusive to the Russians) to Voitsberg; and thence throughWolfsberg to the Austrian-Jugoslav border.In Venezia Giulia, a mixed Imperial and U.S. force is occupying the portarea of Trieste, with Jugoslavs in control of the remainder of the town. In viewof Marshal Tito&apos;s attitude, it has not been possible to. apply Allied military government to the Province, and considerable food shortage and civilian distressis consequently reported. Jugoslav forces have been steadily building up in theGorizia-Triesie-Monfalcone area during the past week. Approximately 34,000Jugoslav regular army troops with some guns and tanks are now gathered betweenTrieste and the Isonzo from Gorizia to the river mouth. North-east of Udineis another additional force estimated at 14,000. In Southern Austria, Jugoslavpartisan forces have thinned out from Klagenfurt and the area to the S.E., butare said only to be awaiting the arrival of further troops from the south.From the Fifth Army there is nothing to report, save the collection andevacuation of German men and material.iEgean.Garrison Islands.35. The German garrison in Crete surrendered to our land forces at2230 hours on the 9th. Earlier on the same day their garrison on Melos, in theCyclades, which was just over 500 strong, also surrendered.Dodecanese.36. The German commander in the Dodecanese surrendered unconditionallyat L010 hours on the 8th to Imperial troops operating under command of theC-in-O, Middle East. The islands of Leros and Cos were occupied on the12th and 13th and the disarmament of the Germans on Rhodes was completed onthe 14th.
Jugoslavia.37. The German forces, which had for so long been conducting a stubbornwithdrawal through Jugoslavia, were at the end compelled to quicken theirretreat. On the 8th, forces of the Jugoslav 2nd Army advancing from the S.E.captured Zagreb.  Ljubljana, the chief town of Slovenia, fell on the 7th.The Partisan forces have reached the pre-war frontiers of Jugoslavia at all points and are rounding up large quantities of German Croat &quot; Quisling &quot;prisoners.An order of the day by Marshal Tito, on the 15th, announced that organised resistance by enemy forces had ceased and that the last pocket had been compelledto capitulate to the Jugoslav 3rd Army.&quot;Burma.       (An outline map is included as an inset.)38. On the 16th, advancing down the Arakan coast from Sandoway, allied troops entered Gwa, 50 miles to the south.Troops of the 33rd Indian Corps have reached the road Mindon-Thayetmyoon the west bank of the Irrawaddy. A bridgehead was also established 5 miles south of Thayetmyo. An armoured column from this Corps has continued itsadvance down the road Prome-Rangoon. On the 15th leading elements were reported to be within 9 miles of Letpadan. From Rangoon, 4th Corps troopsadvancing northwards to link up with the armoured column approachingLetpadan reached a point 18 miles south of Taikkyi and the two columns are now reported to be only 15 miles apart.Other troops of the 4th Corps have closed up to the Sittang River fromShwegyin to Mokpalin.Pacific.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)39. Luzon. The 25th U.S. Infantry Division has captured the Balete Pass,some 30 miles S.E. of Baguio. This pass is the gateway to the Cagayan Valleyin northern Luzon. Further south, U.S. forces have reached the east coast at apoint 11 miles south of Infanta.40. Mindanao. On the 10th April, troops of the 40th U.S. infantry division landed unopposed in Maoajalar Bay on the north coast of the island,and have now penetrated 15 miles inland. Bitter hghting continues in the area10 miles west of Davao.Tarakan.41. Australian troops have captured Djoeata oilfields in the centre of the island.   Enemy resistance has now decreased considerably.New Guinea.42. On the 13th, the 6th Australian Infantry Division captured Wewak,after a fresh landing 9 miles east of the town.Okinawa.43. Both the U.S. Corps on Okinawa are now operating in the southernsector. Progress has been made along the whole front, but more particularly on the U.S. right flank where two Marine divisions are deployed and forward troops have entered the suburbs of Naha. On the east coast of the islandE.S. troops have captured Yonabaru airstrip.AIR SITUATION,Europe.44.
