THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;s GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET Copy No.*/.P. (45) 251.iSth April, 1945.WAR CABINET.PAY OF NURSING OFFICERS OF THE ARMY and royal AIR FORCE.War Service Increments.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE Memorandum by the Secretaries of State for War and Air(W.P. (45) 221) indicates the main grounds for my objection to the suggestionthat Service nurses should receive the War Service increments granted last september to the Armed Forces in general.2. It should be remembered that although Army and R.A.F. NursingOfficers are constitutionally members of the Forces, as stated in paragraph 3 of w.P. (45) 221, Naval nurses are civilians, though they are remunerated on thesame basis. While I am not placing reliance on this point in my opposition tothe Service Ministers&apos; present proposal, it serves to illustrate the difficulty of drawing a firm distinction between Service nurses on the one hand and civiliannurses on the other. In the United Kingdom at any rate, the duties on whichthese nurses are engaged are to a large extent interchangeable : if the service ministers point to the fact that Service nurses will be required to continue serviceafter the European Cease Fire, it is also true that civilian nurses will continueto minister to Service casualties after that date, subject, in certain important respects, to the control of the Minister of Labour and National Service.3. The effect of the 1943 decision allowing Service nurses to be assimilatedto the Rushcliffe salary scales is set out in the appendix to this memorandum.It produced substantial increases of pay for the Service nurses, in which the armed Forces in general did not participate. In electing to be aligned forremuneration purposes with civilian nurses, thereby deriving considerable advantage, the Service nurses have, in my view, surrendered any claim to receiveat the same time benefits which were designed for, and have been properlyconfined to, members of the Armed Forces remunerated on the normal Servicebasis. To concede such a claim would be calculated to give rise to counterclaimsfrom the civilian nurses, who are, to a large extent, engaged on exactly similarduties and who also have not been immune from hardship and danger during thewar. I find it difficult to accept the suggestion that the Service nurses could be distinguished on account of their liability to service overseas : it would be import-ing a new principle into the remuneration of Government servants to introduce a pay differential taking account of this factor. If it is a fact that the prospectof overseas service is one which is wholly unattractive to the Nursing Services,the compensation for this disability must be looked for in the substantialallowances which are paid in respect of service at stations abroad and, in thecase of the Far East, in the Japanese Campaign pay which is payable in additionto the Far East Allowance.4. I have seen no evidence that my view that Service nurses should nothave the best of both worlds is not meeting with general acceptance. The replygiven by the Secretary of State for Air to Mrs. Tate on the 21st March(Hansard, column 796), to the effect that the Service nurses were not to receiveWar Service increments because of their assimilation to the civilian pay scales,seems to have evoked no special comment.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,18th April, 1945.[29716],
