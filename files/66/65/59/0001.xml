THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJES GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 309.16th May, 1945.WAR CABINET.EMPLOYMENT OF GERMAN PRISONERS OF WAR OUTSIDEGERMANY AFTER THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN EUROPE.I venture to suggest that the Secretary of State for War in paragraphs 5and 6 of his War Cabinet Paper, W.P. (45) 292 of the 10th May, is approachingthis problem from a wrong angle. We must be clear as to our objective. Is itto punish and reform Nazis, or is it to obtain labour necessary to the british war effort against Japan, and the maintenance of food production pendingcomplete demobilisation ? I suggest that it is the latter, and the reason why thevarious Ministries tabulated in Appendix A of W.P. (45) 292 have asked for730,000 prisoners of war is that they are required for essential purposes.2. So far as agriculture is concerned, it would be far more useful to have250,000 &quot; tame &quot; Germans than Nazis. The Secretary of State for War&apos;s ideaof using Nazis involves guarding them and employing them only in comparativelylarge parties. On any farm there are many jobs that can be done by smallparties of men, but few that can be done economically by large gangs.3. To replace the Italians now working in England by Nazis who canonly operate in large guarded gangs would be a disaster to British agriculture.As the Minister of Agriculture has pointed out, the agricultural position isin some respects more critical than at any time since 1939. The old men thenleft on the farms are six years older and are failing; the supply of land girlshas dried up, it is increasingly difficult to get voluntary help. Farmers areselling their dairy herds because they can get no labour to milk the cows. Andthis when there is a world food shortage.4. In these&apos; circumstances, I hope that the 250,000 prisoners for whomthe Ministry of Agriculture have asked will be made available and will be&quot;tame&quot; Germans. These, like Italians, can be housed unguarded in vacantcottages or disused Army huts near to the farms on which they are to work.On many farms the situation has been saved by the Italians and it is not perhapsgenerally realised that the &quot;non-co-operators&quot; (i.e., Fascists) are no more guardedthan the &quot;co-operators.&quot; When the Italians leave they must be replaced byGermans who can operate in the same fashion. This has proved possible in Franceand Belgium and should not be impossible here provided that the right type ofGerman is selected.5. The question of what ought to be done with the fanatical Nazis is anentirely different one. By all means employ them in guarded gangs wherever they can be most useful but this is not on British farms.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.Ministry of Economic Warfare, W. 1,imii May, 1945.29903]
