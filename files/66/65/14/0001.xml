April 1945.Copy No.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH 1945 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.THE Opposition have clone their best to keep alive the bitter controversyover the reinforcements problem. Mr. Bracken refused to retract any of theviolent charges made by him during the Grey North by election campaign, and asked that a Royal Commission should be appointed to investigate the Armyadministration since General McNaughton assumed office as Minister of NationalDefence. Mr. Bracken also demanded that General McNaughton should resignin recognition of his failure to obtain a seat in Parliament. General McNaughtonfor his part reiterated that the reinforcement situation is satisfactory, categori-cally asserting, &quot; With certainty I say that the Army to-day is fully provided with the reinforcements it requires.&quot;2. In reply to Mr. Bracken&apos;s accusation that soldiers had thrown their riflesoverboard during a recent troop movement to England, National Defence Head-quarters announced on the 4th March that a Private W. H. Smith was in fact theonly soldier discovered to have thrown his rifle overboard, and that he had been sentenced to 18 months&apos; detention.3. General McNaughton is now seeking nomination in the Saskatchewanconstituency of his birth.4. The Prime Minister visited Mr. Roosevelt early in the month. He spenttwo days at the White House. Fie was accompanied by Mr. Norman Robertson,the Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs and by General Pope, his military Adviser.5. Mr. Roosevelt was most cordial in his reference to Canada and to canada&apos;s Prime Minister personally during his regular press conference, to which mr. King was invited. He referred to the United States-Canadian relationshipas a model for international co-operation. Canada, Mr. Roosevelt said, occupieda unique place as a &quot;middle Power,&quot; and would probably play an importantrole at the San Francisco Conference. Her membership in the British Common-wealth linked her with an important political world unit, and her geographical position as a North American nation with United States. But Canada was alsoa nation in her own right and her war effort had given her an honoured placeamongst nations. He continued that he and Mr. King had discussed questions ofinternational economic and trading policy facing both countries after the war,and that the United States and Canada had a common interest in working towardsthe reduction of trade barriers. Mr. Mackenzie King associated himself withMr. Roosevelt in this statement, but stated on his return to Canada that it covered&quot; a point of view, rather than specific policies.&quot;6.   As regards the forthcoming Conference in San Francisco,. Mr. Kingreturned to Ottawa in an optimistic frame of mind.   Fie said on his return &quot; Ishould think there will be very little difficulty in the different nations gettingtogether on the Dumbarton Oaks draft for a permanent World Organisation.[29765] . eSECRET.W.P. (45) 284.20th April, 1945.
27. Mr. Colin Gibson, Minister of National Revenue, was appointed Ministerof National Defence for Air on the 8th March. Mr. Gibson has been acting Ministerof National Defence for Air since the resignation of Major Power at the time ofthe conscription crisis. Mr. McKinnon, Minister of Trade and Commerce, will act as Minister of National Revenue until a new appointment is made.Mr. Douglas Abbott, who has been for two years the Parliamentary Assistant tothe Minister of Finance, has now been appointed to a similar post with general mcnaughton, and will presumably deputise for him in the House of Commons.8. The Ontario Government were defeated in the Legislative Assembly onthe 22nd March. Colonel Drew, the Premier, advised dissolution : the Lieutenant-Governor accepted this recommendation, and an election will take place in June.9. The Family Allowance Bill was passed authorising the provincial government of Quebec to make any agreement necessary with the federal government for establishing a system of family allowances. Mr. Duplessis, whostrongly opposed the Federal Act when it was introduced, as an infringement of provincial rights, made it clear that his Government was &quot;insisting&quot; on the respect of provincial rights, but was ready to co-operate with Ottawa &quot; within these limits.&quot;.10. An anti-conscription motion introduced by an Independent member tothe effect that &quot; this House ardently protests against the imposition of conscrip-tion in Canada for overseas service, and extremely regrets that Mr. King hasbroken his most sacred pledges,&quot; was adopted by the Quebec Legislature, onlyfive members voting aorainst the motion.11. Two members of the Manitoba legislature were expelled from the C.C.F.Party on the grounds that they were following the Communist line. The anxietyshown by the press may indicate their fear that there is an increase in powerof the Labour-Progressive Party in Canada,12. Mr. Thomas Miller, publisher of the Moose Jatv Times, has beenappointed Lieutenant-Governor of Saskatchewan to succeed the HonourableArchibald McNab, who retired some months ago because of ill heatlh. The newC.C.F. Government have decided to cease to provide an official residence for the lieutenant-Governor.13.   Mr. Dupuy has been appointed Canadian Minister to the Netherlands.14. Mr. Vaillancourt of Montreal has been appointed Canadian Ministerto Cuba. He has always been active in political, educational and cultural circlesin Quebec Province.15. The first Ambassador from Peru, Sr. Alfredo Benevides, arrived in ottawa.16. Mr. Massey, High Commissioner for Canada in London, has beenappointed to represent Canada on the United Nations War Crimes Commissionin London.Economic.17. The War-time Prices and Trade Board announced on the 21st Marchthat there would be a cut in the industrial sugar quotas from the 1st April asa percentage of the 1941 usage. Bakers are to get 75 per cent.; biscuit andcereal manufacturers 70 per cent, and all other industrial users 65 per cent. Theestimated saving is 7,000 tons a year. Previously the Board had announcedthat in 1945 the civilian sugar ration would be reduced by two pounds a year.Service A activities.18. On the 7th H.M.C. frigates of the 25th Escort Group probably sank a U-boat in St. George&apos;s Channel.19. During the month H.M.C.S. Sioux (destroyer) formed part of the escortto a convoy proceeding from the United Kingdom to North Russia, while alsoparticipating in escort duties for the return convoy.20. On the 17th H.M.C.S. Guysborough (fleet minesweeper) was torpedoed200 miles south-west of Ushant, and subsequently sank at night while in tow,when one officer and three ratings were lost.
21. On the 20th H.M.C.S. New Glasgow (frigate) sighted and rammed aperiscope and &apos;&apos; schnorkel&apos;&apos; off Lough Foyle which passed under her bridge andlifted her out of the water. Two days later H.M.C.S. Thetford Mines (frigate)picked up thirty-three survivors from a sunken U-boat in this area.22. During the last week of the month H.M.C.S. Puncher (escort carrier)and H.M.C. Ships Haida and Iroquois (destroyers) formed part of a force whichcarried out a sweep off the Norwegian coast when aircraft were flown off toattack Aalesond and Vikeroy.23. On the 29th H.M.C.S. Teme (frigate) was torpedoed off Lands Endresulting in her stern being blown off and her having to be towed into MountsBay. Casualties suffered as a result of this attack were one rating killed andthree missing.24. During the first week of the month the First Canadian Army continuedto press the enemy back between the Maas and the Rhine against stiff resistance,but by the end of the week the enemy possessed only one bridgehead west of the rhine in this area. On the 8th a new attack was launched by United Kingdomand Canadian troops of the Canadian First Army against the town of Xanten,which was the key to the enemy&apos;s one remaining bridgehead in this area. Bythe 9th this attack was successful and with Allied troops exerting pressure along the whole perimeter, the enemy was forced to withdraw the majority of his troops across the river by the following day, when all organised resistance onthe West Bank of the Rhine in this sector ceased.25. On the night of the 23rd/24th the Second British Army launched theirassault across the Rhine, but except for a Canadian brigade which was employedagainst Emmerich, the main bulk of the Canadian forces were not used in the assault till the beginning of the next month.26. A total of 44 R.C.A.F. Squadrons were operational overseas during themonth, of which 23 were located in the United Kingdom, 18 on the continent,1 in Italy, and 2 in Burma.27. Heavy bombers of No. 6 R.O.A.F. Group flew 2,842 sorties during themonth of March, which compares with 2,146 flown in the preceding month.Losses were 43 aircraft as compared with 25 in February, while the main targets for the Group were factories, oil refineries and marshalling yards in Germany.Squadrons of the Group claim seven enemy aircraft destroyed, four probably destroyed and four damaged.28. Beaufighter, Sunderland and Wellington aircraft of the R.C.A.F.Squadrons in Coastal Command flew 307 sorties during March which compares with 165 flown during February.29. R.C.A.F. Squadrons with the Second Tactical Air Force flew 5,944sorties during the month, which shows an increase of some 700 sorties over thetotal flown for the preceding month. Seventeen enemy aircraft are claimed asdestroyed with one probably destroyed and three damaged for seventeen Canadianaircraft reported missing.30. No. 406 Mosquito Intruder Squadron of Fighter Command flew 137sorties during which six enemy aircraft were reported as destroyed and sixteenas damaged for the loss of three Mosquitoes.31. Of the three R.C.A.F. Dakota Squadrons in Transport Command two are in Burma and one in the United Kingdom and.these surpassed their previousrecord number of sorties flown in February by flying 4,284 in March.32. One A.O.P. Squadron of the R.C.A.F. is already operating with the armed Forces on the continent, while the two remaining recently-formedsquadrons are now awaiting transfer to an active theatre of operations.33. No. 417 Fighter Squadron located in Italy flew 539 sorties for theloss of two Spitfires.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.34.   The Commonwealth Treasurer, Mr. J. B. Chifley, introduced into theHouse of Representatives new Commonwealth banking legislation.   This consists of two Bills, one providing for the regulation of the banking system, and the other[29765] B 2
extending the functions of the Commonwealth Bank and abolishing theCommonwealth Bank Board. These proposals have been strongly opposed bybanking interests in Australia, and have had a mixed reception from theAustralian public.35. In a survey of his recent mission to Ottawa and Washington, theMinister for Trade and Customs, Senator R. L. Keane, said that Lease-Lend aid to Australia in 1945 would probably amount to  125 million. An officialprovisional estimate put the total value of Lease-Lend supplies which havearrived in Australia from the inception of the scheme up to the 31st January1945, at  244 million.36. Under the terms of the Mutual Aid Act, many millions of dollars&apos; worth of supplies have been sent to Australia by the Canadian Government. Up to november 1944 Canadian supplies to Australia were valued at 60 million dollars,and covered guns, ammunition, aircraft, tools, chemicals and textiles.37. The Commonwealth Governments decision to nationalise the inter-State air lines was finally confirmed. The Air Minister, Mr. Drakeford, was authorised to appoint a managing director for the statutory authority established to operate air lines. Qantas Empire Airways will operate a service between london and Australia in conjunction with British Overseas Airways. A service will also be provided by Qantas between New Guinea and Australia.38. The Government plans to assist ex-servicemen on demobilisation were announced in the House of Representatives on the 23rd March by the Ministerfor Post-War Reconstruction, Mr. Denman, when he introduced the Re-estabiish-ment and Employment Bill. The principle of preference for ex-servicemen is established, and the Bill makes it compulsory for employers to take back formeremployees wishing to return to their former occupations, and, if the employerrefuses, the case must be submitted to a reinstatement committee for adjudication.Ex-servicemen on reinstatement must receive pay, including increases, to whichthey would have been entitled for the whole period during which they served withthe forces. Special loans will be made to ex-servicemen to enable them tore-establish themselves in civilian life.39. The Prime Minister called for an immediate examination of Australia^meat position, to see if more meat could be shipped to Britain either by increasingthe Australian output or by cutting civilian rations.Service A activities.40. On the 26th H.M.A.S. Terka (water carrier) foundered in MadangHarbour (New Guinea).41. During the last half of the month H.M.A. Ships Qtiiberon andQuick Match (destroyers) formed part of the escort to the force of the BritishPacific Fleet from which aircraft have been flown to carry out daylight attacks on the Sakishima group of the Ryukyu Islands.42. At the beginning of the month troops of the Third Australian Divisioncleared the Makateka area in South Bougainville in the face of stiff opposition,while an advance was also made towards the East coast, where high grounddominating Numa Numa was captured. Later in the month troops of the samedivision landed on Saposa, N.W. of Bougainville, and cleared the island of japanese, and followed this up a few clays later by making a further landing onthe Western side of the Soraken Peninsula, where several Japanese counter-attacks were successfully repulsed. In the South of the Island strong resistancewas still being encountered at the close of the month.43. In the seventeen weeks since Australian forces took over the Torokinaperimeter from the Americans almost one-third of Bougainville Island has beenrecaptured.44. In New Guinea troops of the 6th Australian Infantry Division had bythe 11th March reached Sawom, which is on the North coast of the Island some32 miles West of Wewak, an advance of 60 miles Eastwards from Aitape. Atthe same time good progress has been made inland across the TorricelliMountains, where a point some 35 miles S.W. of Wewak has been reached.During the last week of March the advance towards Wewak from Aitape was continued, and the Japanese airfield at Dagua some 22 miles West of Wewak
captured together with large quantities of stores and equipment, while strongerresistance was met in the inland drive across the Torricelli Mountains.45. At the beginning of the month the capture of Lamarien in New Britainby troops of the Fifth Australian (Infantry) Division opened the way for patrolsto cross the Mavlo River, but the Japanese had withdrawn so fast that contactwas lost. Later in the month Japanese positions were encountered in theWaitavalo plantations, and by the close of the month Waitavalo Ridge had been cleared and Australian forces were cutting across the coastal tract to the east which leads to the Gazelle Peninsula, where increased resistance is being met.NEW ZEALAND.46. Mrs. Fraser, wife of the Prime Minister, died in New Zealand on the7th March. The announcement of her death was received with deep regret in new Zealand, where she had been associated fqr many years with social welfarework, and with many war-time organisations.Economic.47. On his arrival in New Zealand after a five months&apos; tour overseas,Mr. D. G. Sullivan, Minister of Munitions, made a statement on his discussions in the United Kingdom about the development of secondary industry in NewrZealand, in which he said that &quot;it was conceded that no exception could be takento such a policy, though the British authorities were anxious that the pursuit ofthis policy in New Zealand should not result in a reduction of total trade between britain and the Dominion.&quot;48. Reports about the meat situation in Great Britain elicited the unanimous view that the New Zealand public is anxious to help to supply the deficiencies in the United Kingdom meat ration, and has only to be asked, in ordergladly to tighten its belt by making a substantial reduction of the present NewZealand ration.49. The announcement that there will be higher pay and allowances for theNew Zealand armed forces and possibly an increase in the salaries of civilservants and certain industrial groups has led to local comment on the score that new Zealand&apos;s price stabilisation policy may be endangered.50. In view of the progressive deterioration in the world supply position of sugar, New Zealand has reduced her sugar import programme by 15 per cent. to achieve this, the sugar ration for domestic consumers was cut from 12 oz. to 10 oz.a week as from the 19th March.Service Activities.51. During the latter half of the month H.M.N.Z.S. Gambia (cruiser)formed part of the British Pacific Fleet from which aircraft have been flown off to make strikes against the Sakishima Group of the Ryukyu Islands.52. In Italy, although the troops of the Second New Zealand Division havebeen in the line on the Eighth Army front during seven days of the month underreview, they have not taken part in any outstanding operations in this area,UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.53. Replying in the Assembly to a request by the Opposition leader for a clear statement on the Government^ &quot;Africa Policy,&quot; the Prime Minister said the same development was possible in Africa as had taken place on the american continent, where a Pan-American Union existed. To Dr. Malan&apos;s questionwhether his views on regional regrouping were also the views of the BritishGovernment, General Smuts said that in public he did not always speak as PrimeMinister, and that he had frequently expressed the opinion that British colonialarrangements in Africa were not the best possible. Referring to the clause in theUnion Constitution which provided for the eventual inclusion of the High Com-mission Territories in the Union, General Smuts said &quot; the destiny of the high commission territories is that they will become South African territory.&quot;
54. During the Budget debate Dr. Malan intervened to speak about the colour question. The Prime Minister answered by explaining that the Capecoloured question was an old inheritance, and a solution of it could not be foundin a day. In an endeavour to improve conditions in residential areas, the Govern-ment were setting up new villages and residential areas where the whites and coloured members of the community were kept apart, so that within a generationor two there would be a general &quot; sorting out.&quot;55. On the question of Indians in the Union, the Prime Minister said thatthe Government hoped to introduce legislation this session to amend the Housing-Act and to provide for the Government to have the ex-propriation powers contem-plated in the Provincial Ordinances, thus enabling the scheme of setting asideseparate residential areas to be carried through.56. The Prime Minister, in referring to migration to South Africa, saidthat he favoured a revision of the migration laws which would strengthen theEuropean foundation of the Union.57. The President of the Southern African Air Transport Conference,Mr. F. E. Sturrock (Minister of Transport), reported that the conference had agreed in principle with the setting up of a Southern African Air Council withheadquarters in the Union, and a permanent secretariat represented by the Union,Great Britain and the other British-African States.58. Dr. Van Rensburg, the leader of the Ossewa Brandwag movement, con-tinued his overtures to the Nationalist Party for reconciliation. These have sofar been rejected by Dr. Malan, who is now professedly convinced of the goodnessof the democratic parliamentary system, and the undesirability of Fascistorganisations that have threatened his leadership and undermined the voting-strength of his party.59. From recent appeals by Dr. Karl Bremer, a Nationalist Member ofParliament, for more co-operation in politics, it has become apparent that theNationalist Party is aiming at attracting the votes of United Party followers whoare dissatisfied with the present Governments home record during the war.Dr. Bremer has since denounced the idea of a coalition under General Smuts&apos; rule.60. Mr. Louis Esselen, personal adviser and close friend of General Smuts,died during the month. Tributes to his services to South Africa and inparticular to the United Party -and to his wise and beneficent influence, havebeen paid by newspapers of almost all shades of opinion.Service Activities.61. On the 19th H.M.S.A.S. Natal (frigate) in company with H.M.S.Lancaster, attacked a U-boat off St. Abbs Head, and brought a cased dinghy to the surface.62. According to reports received from South Africa H.M.S.A. ShipsSouthern Sea and Southern Isles are at Cape Town being refitted and havingRadar installed. They will in due course replace H.M.S.A. Ships Turgonteinand Vereeniging in escort groups operating in the Indian Ocean, North ofDurham. By agreement the number of S.A.N.F. escort vessels on loan to theRoyal Navy has been temporarily reduced to six until the former two shipsbecome available.63. During the month the Sixth South African Armoured Division was outof the line on the Eighth Army front in Italy.64. During the first half of February the Roads Group of the S.A.E.C.,consisting of three South African companies and two R.E. companies, continued in support of the Eighth Army in the Rimini and Forli areas, where, in additionto normal road maintenance, auto patrols of the group had the extra work of removing snow and ice from the roads and bridges.65. The Railway Construction Group of the same Corps was still engaged on the construction of the railway line between Prato and Bologna where heavyrain, snowfalls, thaws followed by floods, landslides and the reluctance of Italiancivil labourers to work in the wet all combined to hamper work.66. According to the latest co-ordinated reports for January snow andrain continued to determine the extent of the air operations of the S.A.A.F. in italy.
67. No. 2 Wing, comprising Nos. 31 and 34 Bomber Squadrons, took part inattacks on communication targets at Salcano, Latisava and Udine, while they alsodropped supplies over Northern Italy on two days of the month.68. No. 3 Wing, comprising Nos. 12, 21, 24 and 30 Squadrons (equipped with Marauders), carried out attacks against various targets in Northern Italy.69. No. 7 Wing after having good flying weather the first four days of themonth was handicapped by bad for the remainder, but operated almost daily insupport of the Eighth Army and bombed and straffed a large number of variedtargets on this front.70. No. 8 Wing composed of two R.A.F. Squadrons and the 3rd and 11thSouth African Squadrons of fighter-bombers operated in support of the FifthArmy and attacked targets in Northern Italy.EIRE.71. Mr. de Valera stated in the Bail on the 14th March that his Depart-ment were taking all possible steps to obtain news of &quot;Eire citizens at present inthe Philippine Islands.72. On the 21st March, Mr. de Valera stated that none of the Eire Lega-tions on the Continent had been able to communicate with the Channel Islandssince June, 1944; but that he had no information to suggest that Eire nurses orany other Eire citizens had been removed from any of the Islands to Germany.Economic.73. Replying in the Dail to the debate on the Vote of Account for 16,196,000, the Minister for Finance said that Eire should develop its tradeand commerce with its nearest neighbour and get both countries to develop themto the fullest extent.74. The publication of monthly trade statistics has been resumed in Eire.Imports in January totalled  2,344,411, as compared with  2,222.383 inJanuary, 1944. Exports amounted to  2,119,798, as compared with  2.280,937.Imports from Great Britain totalled  1,391,117, and from the United States 383,930. Exports to Great Britain amounted to  1,637.499. to the UnitedStates  20,384.75. The Budget to be introduced by the Minister for Finance in May forthe financial year 1945-46 will be for the record figure of  52.166,000.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India,Political.76. In the field of all-India politics no major developments occurred during march. A wave of speculation and expectancy was created by the visit ofLord Wavell to London for consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government and washeightened by the subsequent departure of the Home Member whose visit, thoughannounced to be for discussion in London of questions of recruitment, was widely but incorrectly assumed to be really in connexion with plans for therelease of the Congress leaders.77. The political stagnation did not extend to provincial politics and the predominantly Moslem League ministries in four of the five Provinces underministerial government ran into heavy weather. Loss of its majority in theLegislature caused the Moslem League ministry in the North- West frontier province to resign and its place was taken by the first Congress ministry to returnto office since 1939. In Assam the Moslem League Prime Minister found it necessary to reconstitute his Coalition ministry. The Hindu ministers nowrely on the pledged support of the Congress Party in the Legislature, -though thelatter were not prepared themselves to resume the responsibilities of office. in both Provinces the Congress Party have acted with the previously soughtacquiescence of Mr. Gandhi; but there is no solid ground for regarding these two
cases as symptomatic of a general change in Congress policy leading to the resumption of office by Congress ministries elsewhere. In Bengal developmentson the eve of the end of the budget session (the Speaker taking it on himself to adjourn the Assembly sine die after the defeat of the Ministry which was pre-dominantly Moslem League) forced the Governor to take over the administration under Section 93 of the Government of India Act, as happened in similar circum-stances two years ago. In 1943 the Section 93 administration lasted only about )three weeks; this time, it may last much longer in the absence of any prospects ofa new and stable ministry being formed. In all three Provinces the develop-ments have been a blow to the prestige of the Moslem League, inadequately com-pensated by its success in Sind, where it asserted its authority over the moslem league Prime Minister who, in deference to orders from the League, was forcedto abandon his attempt to strengthen the backing for his ministry by including in it a Moslem who did not belong to the League.Foreign and Frontier Relations.78. Afghanistan. An Afghan Mission composed of members of theirPublicity and Education Departments has been in India since the middle of Marchand appears to be having a successful tour. Negotiations with the rebel leaderMazrak continue without result. The severe winter has caused serious losses insheep and cattle, and is creating anxiety as to food supplies. Food riots have occurred in Flerat though the position appears to be now in hand. The difficulties caused by shortage of supplies were enhanced by lack of transport.Economic.79. Hydari Mission. The Mission returned to India at the end of March,having completed their discussion with the Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment regarding the extent of the assistance which can be given to India&apos;economy. They were more concerned with the position in 1946, when the strain on India is likely to be greatest, than with that in 1945. In many important matters it was not possible to hold out a prospect of more assistance than thatarranged before the Mission arrived and in some cases, e.g., food-grain imports,this falls well below what the Government of India consider essential. Asregards food-grain imports, a decision had recently been taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment at a high level, and there was therefore little scope for intervention by the Mission. They did, however, concern themselves with the matter, but were unsuccessful in securing any improvement in the facilities for shippingwheat to India, Over a wide field the Mission were nevertheless satisfied withtheir discussions, provided that the hopes of supplies held out to them can be implemented.80. The most important outcome of their visit was an agreement in respectof cotton textiles under which ceilings will be put in 1940 on military orders placed on Indian production and on Indian exports of 600 million yards and400 million yards respectively. These figures compare with the 1945 ceilings of800 million yards and 600 million yards respectively. It is also hoped to increaseIndian production by 200 million yards in 1946, thus making an additional600 million yards in all available to the Indian civil market, against the800 million yards extra desired by the Government of India.* 81. Commercial discrimination. The provisions of the Government of india act which are designed to prevent discrimination in India against personsdomiciled in the United Kingdom or against United Kingdom companies weredebated in the Indian Legislative Assembly on the 2nd March. Sir ArdeshirDalai, the Member of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council for planning and Development, said in his reply to the debate that the Government of india would discuss this matter with His Majesty&apos;s Government and report the result to the Assembly. Sir A. Dalai was due to come to London for this purpose atthe end of April, although it is not yet known for what amendment of the existing provisions of the Act he wishes to ask. It is believed that he fears that these would prejudice his plans for the post-war industrial development of India.These plans, which have not yet been considered by the Government of india as a whole, appear to involve a rigid control by the State of all expansions of )industry.
82. Food. The situation in March gave cause for some anxiety. supplies to markets in the wheat-growing provinces dried up some weeks before the newharvest with the result that a heavy strain was thrown on the Central FoodDepartment to meet outstanding liabilities for rationed cities and other deficitareas during the following two months. There is some fear that the resources at their command may not fully suffice to meet demands until the new crop comes into the market. It was not possible to meet the Government of India&apos;s request for an emergency supply of 50,000 tons of wheat in May to fill this gap. (see also reference under &quot; Hydari Mission &quot;- above.)Finance.83. Indian Budget. The Finance Bill, embodying the Finance Member&apos;sproposals regarding rates of taxation in 1945-46, was rejected by the LegislativeAssembly, both on its introduction and on its return after recommendation by theGovernor-General, as a protest, on familiar lines, against India&apos;s dependentconstitutional status. The Bill was subsequently passed by the Council of State,and became law under the provisions of Section 67 B of the Ninth Schedule to theGovernment of India Act, 1935. A separate Bill,, dfealing with income-tax allowances in respect of earned income, depreciation of new buildings, plant and machinery and expenditure on scientific research, is still being considered by theLegislature.Naval, Military and. Air For\ie Activities.Royal Indian Navy.84. M.Ls. of the 4:9th R.N. M.L. Flotilla were paid oft&apos; and turned over tothe Royal Indian Navy on. the 1st March.85. HALS. Betony was turned over, to the Royal Indian Navy and recom-missioned as H.M.I.S. Sind on the 24th March.86. H.M.I. Ships have been engaged in Convoy Escort duties throughoutthe East Indies Area during the month.Military.87.   Mediterranean. No change.88. Burma. The Japanese having lost their pre-monsoon gamble inImphal last year are now suffering from a law of diminishing returns, and theresults achieved by S.E. Asia Command are well ahead of the time scheduleoriginally proposed. A large proportion of the Japanese in Central Burma arenow contained in the triangle Mandalay-Meiktila-Myingyan.89. 15th Corps Front. Good progress was made down the road southwardsparallel to the coast, and our troops were approaching Taungup, due west ofProme.90. 14 A Army Front. The Japanese continued to offer stiff opposition on both sides of the Irrawaddy in the vicinity of Chauk in their endeavour to cover the oilfields.91. Meiktila and its airfields were captured. The enemy made determinedefforts to recover the main airfield which were frustrated with heavy losses.Systematic sweeps from Meiktila by our armoured columns in all directions alsoinflicted many casualties.92. With the fall of Fort Dufferin the occupation of Mandalay was com-pleted, Maymyo was occupied, and the road between these two places was cleared.A rapid thrust southwards of over 60 miles reached Pindale and Wundwin andcontact was established with columns moving North from Meiktila. LaterKyaukse, 25 miles south of Mandalay, was occupied and the clearance of the road between Mandalay and Meiktila was virtually completed.93. An enemy attempt to isolate Meiktila from the north-west also failedunder pressure from our troops advancing south-east from Myingyan, thoughenemy troops continued to hold out round Taungtha, 38 miles north-west ofMeiktila.94.   Northern Combat A rea Command.- The 36th Division captured Mogok,the ruby-mine centre, and advanced on Kyaukme, which is south-west of Hsipaw[29765] c
on the Maymyo-Lashio road. Meanwhile, the Chinese forces were clearing theHsipaw area and operating south and east of it to cut the roads leading to Loilem.A ir.95. Intensive strategic bombing was a feature of the month. Train bustingwas carried on throughout Siam, and railway targets on the Burma-Siam railwaywere attacked. Dumps and stores in the Rangoon area were heavily pounded.Owing to Allied Air superiority and to the loss of airfields the Japanese have beengradually withdrawing their aircraft further from the Burma front. A very successful attack was made by United States fighter aircraft on an airfield nearBangkok. This involved a round trip of 1,500 miles the longest fighter offensiveever flown. The combat cargo task force continued to keep the forces in CentralBurma well supplied. In one period of five days 90,000 rations, 50,000 gallonsof petrol and half a million cigarettes were supplied.General.96. Medical. Campaigning is now being carried out in increasinglyfavourable conditions of terrain, equipment and hygiene. The monsoon, when it comes, will be much lighter in the Irrawaddy valley than in the parts of thecountry we were previously fighting in. The sickness rate of South-East AsiaCommand has fallen to about 1-3 per 1,000 per clay, which is probably about one-twelfth of the 1942 rate.97. Fighting qualities of Indian Troops.--The great gallantry with whichIndian Army troops have been fighting in Burma is emphasised. The number ofV.C.s and&apos; other decorations awarded to them gives an indication of the part played by them.98. Morale and Welfare. Morale was generally unchanged and stood at ahigh level. There was widespread appreciation of improved welfare arrange-ments amongst British troops. The chief credit for this was given to the Earl ofMunster.&apos;s visit. Repatriation for British troops after 3 years 10 months isgenerally considered satisfactory, but a further reduction is expected after the defeat of Germany. The most dissatisfied class is the British personnel of theIndian Army, as owing to the fact that the Indian Army has no establishment inthe United Kingdom, they cannot receive this repatriation privilege : also, owingto the necessity for settling certain conteiitious points, they have not hitherto been receiving Japanese Campaign Pay, with the result that many have for the timebeing been paid less than equivalent ranks in the British Service. This, however,is being remedied with retrospective effect.99. Posts. Postage on air letters from troops in India was reduced from to 3 annas with effect from the 1st March.100. Remounts -Over 16,000 casualties occurred in operational units inA.L.F.S.EA. during 1944. This represented a gross wastage of 6 per cent, per month in horses and 4-9 per cent, in mules.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.101. Enemy-occupied Burma. There are no important developments toreport.1102. Liberated Burma. Nearly half the total area of Burma has beenliberated containing about 30 per cent, of its total population. Except to theChinese the attitude of the Burmese to Allied Forces continues to be friendly.Most towns have suffered, but many villages are unscathed and village Burmansand Shans are said to be happy and contented as usual.103. The only important Burmese so far contacted is Tharawaddy MaungMaung who was a Minister in the last Burmese Government before the Japaneseinvasion, and has been lying low during the enemy occupation. He is now inSimla with the Government of Burma.104. Paddy stocks are reported to be barely sufficient except in Akyab andShwebo. Shortages elsewhere have been increased by transport difficulties andthe enemy destroying food as he retreats. Everywhere consumer goods, particu-larly salt, soap, clothing and cooking oil, are in very short supply.
THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies :&apos; is used to cover not. only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic A ffairs.Food Supplies.105. Ceylon. The maintaining of adequate supplies of rice to Ceyloncontinues to present considerable difficulty. Owing to a reduction in available supplies of rice in America, the authorities there found it necessary to defer forfurther consideration the release of 15,200 tons referred to in my report for lastmonth.106. Delay in shipment of Egyptian rice, largely due to the internal transport difficulties, resulted in Ceylon&apos;s rice stocks becoming seriously depleted. In orderto meet the shortage, an urgent appeal was made to the Government of India forthe release of a further 15,000 tons for immediate shipment to Ceylon. TheGovernment of India have agreed to supply this rice on the understanding that asimilar quantity will be repaid by the end of August 1945 out of the Ministryof Food&apos;s purchases of Egyptian rice.107. Ceylon&apos;s import requirements for the first six months of 1945 havebeen programmed at the rate of 18,000 tons per month. Recent telegrams fromthe Governor of Ceylon have emphasised the importance of imports being continued at this rate for the second half of 1945, as any cut in the existing ration of 2 lb. per head per week would have most serious repercussions on Ceylon&apos;s teaand rubber production, and furthermore would have a grave effect generally inrelation to a build-up in Ceylon from an operational standpoint,108. As it seems unlikely that Ceylon&apos;s needs for the second half of 1945can be wholly met out of the new Brazilian crop, representations are being madeto the United States authorities with a view to obtaining supplies of rice fromthat source.Semi- and Unmanufactured Iron and Steel.109. During the war years, since the inception of Lend-Lease; Colonies,partly by reason of United Kingdom supply difficulties, but mainly owing tolimitations imposed by the Lease-Lend &quot;White Paper &quot; on United kingdom exports, have been compelled to procure their supplies of semi- and Unmanufactured-factured iron and steel from the United States. These materials include a largevariety of items ranging from steel &quot;billets&quot; to nuts and bolts, and to enablesupplies to be facilitated in United States, it has been necessary for requirements to be bulked and ordered by the Colonial Governments. As a result of thediscussions on Lease-Lend last year, however, we have now been able to informColonies that, with one or two exceptions due to continuing supply difficulties inUnited Kingdom, they are now free to order these items from any sourcepreferred, and through normal commercial channels. Their notice has, however,been drawn to the fact that in granting import licences for these supplies theneed for economising in dollar expenditure should be borne well in mind.Textile Supplies.110. In my December report (W.P. (45) 74, paragraph 97) I drew attentionto my concern&apos;at the prospects of a deficiency arising, and I am now seriouslyconcerned to note that export allocations to Colonial territories both from theUnited Kingdom and from the United States have recently been heavily cut,111. The importance of providing adequate supplies of textiles cannot be over-emphasised.     As a result of careful distribution and conservation of[29765] d
resources, serious difficulties have so far been avoided, but there is, however,increasing evidence that the falling off in supplies may have far-reaching conse-quences generally, and particularly in East and West Africa and Ceylon.112. Discontent and unrest may well result, and a shortage in these essen-tial consumer goods will, I fear, have serious repercussions on the productionof food, oil seeds, rubber, sisal and other vital produce.113. I understand that every effort has been made in conjunction with the combined Planning Boards to examine what supplies can be made available from Brazil and other possible sources of supply, but, whatever the result, it isof the greatest importance that the maintenance if not the increase, of existingtextile allocations to Colonial territories should be considered as a matter of urgency.West A frica Cocoa.114. As a result of the review of the world cocoa marketing position it hasbeen decided to defer action on the lines proposed in the White Paper on the marketing of West African Cocoa issued in September 1944, and to leave the marketing arrangements for next season in the hands of the West African&apos;Produce Control Board. In accordance with the undertaking given in that white paper Parliament will be asked this summer to vote a sum equivalent to theprofits on past workings of the Produce Control Board for allocation to theGovernments of the Gold Coast and Nigeria and of the French Cameroons. Asfar as the two British Colonies are concerned the estimate will provide that thesum should be used partly to finance research and partly to finance marketing-organisations, but it is proposed to inform Parliament that the sum for thelatter purpose should not be drawn on by the Governments concerned until detailsof the marketing proposals in question have been submitted to the House and thelatter body given an opportunity to debate them if it so desires.Defence.115. The Duke of Devonshire has arrived back in the United Kingdom after a visit to West and East African troops in India and Burma. He visited the11th East African Division, the 22nd East African Brigade, the 81st and82nd West African Divisions and other units.116. The 82nd West African Division has continued to make progress inthe Arakan east of Akyab and has captured Letmauk on the road to An.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.117. Arab interest has been largely focussed on political activities in Cairo,which have led to the signature of the Covenant of the Arab League. There isno doubt that concern over the Palestine question has been one of the main factors which have led to the formation of the League.118. Jewish activities, particularly on the part of the Jewish Agency, havebeen concerned with an attempt to secure presentation of the Jewish case at san Francisco and the tactics to be employed at the Conference.119. No acts of terrorism occurred during the period under review and thepolice have continued their activities against terrorists, having arrested22 suspected persons. Five Jews were sentenced to imprisonment by a militarycourt for the possession of arms and illegal drilling.120. The High Commissioner has proposed to the Jerusalem municipalitythat the problem of who is to be the new Mayor of Jerusalem should be solved by a scheme of rotation whereby a Moslem, a Jew and a Christian should eachbe Mayor for one year in turn. These proposals led to violent Arab reactions,resulting in a one-day protest strike. The Jews were prepared to accept thescheme on certain conditions.   Discussions are still going on.
Nigeria: Proposals for Constitutional Reform.121. A White Paper (Cmd. No. 6599) was published on the 5th Marchcontaining proposals for constitutional reform put forward by the Governor of nigeria. The main features of these proposals include : the representation of theNative Authorities in the legislature; the institution of Regional Councils forthe Northern, Western and Eastern Provinces; the revision of the membership of the Nigerian Legislative Council and the extension of its powers to cover the Northern Provinces; and the provision of African majorities in both the regional and the Legislative Councils.122. The Governors proposals were laid before the Nigerian LegislativeCouncil at the opening of its budget session on the 5th March and, after debate,the Council has now passed a resolution, supported unanimously by the unofficial members, signifying its approval and recommending the adoption of the pro-posals. It is hoped, however, to arrange for the proposals to be debated inParliament in this country before they are finally accepted.Mauritius.123. A serious outbreak of poliomyelietis has occurred in Mauritius with870 cases up to the end of March. Arrangements have been made for expertassistance to be flown to the Colony from this country and from East africa to advise on treatment and curative measures and for research work to be carriedout on the spot.Bahamas.124. H.R.H. The Duke of Windsor has resigned his appointment asGovernor. He was within a short time of the conclusion of the five-year period for which Governors are now normally appointed.British Honduras.125. The long-standing dispute with Guatemala over the 1859 convention has been revived by the inclusion in the new Guatemalan Constitution of anArticle claiming that British Honduras is Guatemalan territory and that negotiations for its reincorporation in the territory of the Republic are ofnational interest. On the 3rd of March a written protest against this provision was handed tb the Guatemalan Charge d&apos;Affaires. On the 21st March theGuatemalan Government rejected this protest as being injurious to Guatemalanrights and gave some publicity to their action. The Guatemalan Governmenthave also secured the insertion in the final Act of the Mexico City Conference ofa reservation of their rights in regard to British Honduras by making this a condition of their reaffirmation of the principles of the Atlantic Charter.126. In order to satisfy local public opinion the Governor of british honduras has been authorised to issue on the 3rd of April a statement that theembcdiment in the new constitution of the Guatemalan claim to british honduras has in our view no validity whatever and that such unilateral actionon the part of the Guatemalan Government in no way affects the status of british honduras or its inhabitants, who cannot be handed over like chattels to another state.127. It is possible that this dispute may be raised by the GuatemalanGovernment at San Francisco.Gibraltar.128. Sir Findlater Stewart, who has been appointed Commissioner toexamine the problems involved in the repatriation of the remaining Gibraltarianevacuees, left for Gibraltar to consider these matters on the spot.Cyprus.129. The Governor reports that on the 25th March, during the celebrationof Greek Independence Day, disorders took place at Lefkoniko Village (popula-tion 2,700) in Famagusta District. The Police, under a Cypriot sergeant, firedand 2 men were killed and 9 injured.130. Two meetings at Lefkoniko had been permitted, the first between the farmers&apos; Association and the National Party and the second by A.K.E.L., whichis strongly Communist.   The supporters of these two meetings began to fight
and this seems to have caused police intervention. The Governor has appointed a Commission of Enquiry of 3 members, 2 of whom are Cypriot judges.131. Processions and meetings are usually allowed in all towns and villagesto celebrate Greek Independence Day. No disorders took place elsewhere saveat Paphos, where a small demonstration, for which no permit had been given,was dispersed. The A.K.E.L. party is doing its utmost to make political capitalout of the Lefkoniko affray.A aviation.South African Air Conference.132. The South African Air Conference was attended by the Chairman ofthe East African Governors&apos; Conference, and by the Governors of northern rhodesia and Nyasaland. A representative of the Colonial Office was also present.(
