NATIONAL INSURANCE (INDUSTRIAL INJURIES) bill. introduction. The Governments proposals for a scheme of Industrial Injuries Insurancewere set out in Part II of the White Paper on Social Insurance (Cmd. 6551)published in September, 1944. These proposals were the subject of debate in both Houses of Parliament. The Government have carefully considered the observations made during the course of these debates and also representations which have been received from various interested bodies by the Minister ofNational Insurance. As a result they are satisfied that the structure of theScheme set out in the White Paper meets with general acceptance. At the sametime it has seemed to the Government that there were certain criticisms oftheir original proposals which could and should be met by modifications of detail. This Paper sets out first of all the principal changes which have beenmade in the original proposals and then proceeds to give an outline of theScheme as it is embodied in the Bill now presented to the House of Commons.Tables attached show the effect of the changes as applied to a few typical casesof total incapacity and 100 per cent, disablement.B. Changes now made in the original proposals. In order to get a complete picture of the provision to be made for theinjured workman, it is necessary to take account of the benefits proposed underboth the Industrial Injuries Scheme (Part II Cmd. 6551) and the GeneralScheme (Part I of the White Paper Cmd. 6550). Accordingly the following statement of the changes made in the original proposals for Industrial InjuriesInsurance includes certain proposals relating to sickness and unemploymentbenefit which are outside the scope of the present Bill but which it is proposedto include in the Bill giving effect to Part I of the White Paper.3. Injury allowance. The original proposal was tha(t during the period ofincapacitv following an accident the rate of injury allowance should be 35s. aweek for the first 13 weeks and 40s. thereafter. There was to be no fixed period during which this allowance would be paid ; it was to be paid so long as the workman remained incapable of work until replaced by a pension, the pension to be put in payment when it seemed that the disablement was likely to be permanent or prolonged. The proposal now is that the rate of injury allowance should be 40s. a week from the beginning of the incapacity and that if theincapacity lasts for twenty-six weeks or more the allowance should be replaced by a pension, either final or provisional, at the end of the twenty-sixth week.(The basic rate of pension proposed is not changed ; that is, it will be 40s. a week in the case of a workman who is assessed as being 100 per cent, disabled and atproportionate rates for lower degrees of assessment.)4. Unemploy&quot;ability supplement. It was proposed in the White Paper that where a pensioner, notwithstanding remedial measures, remained, by reason ofhis industrial injury, virtually unemployable, he should receive a supplementof 10s. a week to his pension. It is now proposed that this supplement shouldbe 20s. per week. This will apply to past cases (see paragraph 29) as well as to cases arising under the new scheme.
5, Dependants&apos; allowances. It was proposed in the White Paper that when a workman was in receipt of injury allowance at the rate of 35.9. a week an allowance for a wife Or other adult dependant should be payable at the rate of8s. 9d. a week, and that where his injury allowance was at the rate of 40s. a week or where he had a 100 per cent, pension this allowance should be at the rate of10s. per week. For a pensioner with a lower rate of pension the allowance fora wife would be a corresponding proportion of 10s. For a first child of the workman the allowance was to be 5s. when his own allowance was at the 35s.rate, 7s. Gd. when he was in receipt of 40s. a week, and a proportion of 7s. 6d.when he was receiving a pension less than 100 per cent.&apos; 6. After careful consideration of the issues involved, the Government have come to the conclusion that their proposals in respect of dependants shouldbe directed to improving the provision in cases where the injured workmanis for the time being either unfit for work or unable to get it. When he isable to go back to work, he will, like other workmen, have his earnings availablefor the normal support of himself and his family and, if he has any substantialdisability remaining from his injury, a pension for the loss he has suffered inhis own person. Accordingly, it is now proposed that during the period of injury allowance the rate for a wife or other adult dependant should be 16s. aweek and the allowance for a child 7s. 6d. As regards the period when the workman is in receipt of pension under the new scheme, it is proposed that : (a) when he is earning, no allowance for wife, child or other dependantshould be payable ;(b) when he is sick or unemployed, allowances of 16s. for a wife (or otheradult dependant) and 7s. 6d. for a first child should be payable aspart of the sickness or unemployment benefit he would get underPart I (2s. 6d. of the chilcVs allowance would come out of theIndustrial Injuries Fund).(c) when he is in receipt of an &quot; uncmployability supplement &quot; (see para-graph 4 above) allowances of 16s. and 7s. Qd. should be payable outof the Industrial Injuries Fund.Sickness or unemploy&apos;ment benefit under (b) above would be subject to fulfil-ment of the relevant statutory conditions for the receipt of such benefit. the allowance of 16s. for a wife or adult dependant paid with injury allowance orunemployability supplement will be subject to the rule proposed in Part I ofthe White Paper for sickness and unemployment benefit, namely, the allowance would not be payable where the wife or other adult dependant was earningmote than 20s. a week.7. Pensioner who is sick or unemployed. In the original proposals it was contemplated that while a workman was receiving benefit under the industrial injuries Scheme he could not receive any sickness benefit under the GeneralScheme in respect of incapacity due to industrial injury. It is now proposedthat he should not get sickness benefit while in receipt of an injury allowance,but if while he is in receipt of a pension he is or becomes incapable of work heshould, if he satisfies the normal conditions for the receipt of sickness benefit,be entitled, in addition to his pension, to sickness benefit, whether the incapacuyis due to the injury or to some other cause. An industrial pensioner who isunemployed and otherwise qualified would receive unemployment benefit underthe General Scheme. The amount of his benefit would in either case be subject, to some restriction, as. explained in the following paragraph which is based onan existing rule governing payment of sickness benefit to war pensioners. Theamount of any allowance for wife, dependant or child to which he might beentitled would not be affected by this rule.(71213) A*
8. The restriction referred to in the preceding paragraph would be that a workman with a 100 per cent, pension would, until he had further qualifiedby having been insurably employed for ten weeks and paid ten contributionssince the date of his injury, be entitled to half the ordinary rate of sickness benefit for himself. When he had so further qualified he would be entitled tothe full rate. The rate of sickness and unemployment benefit proposed inPart I of the White Paper is 24s. a week. Thus, on this basis, he would receive,in addition to his pension, until he had paid 10 contributions, 12s. a week, andafter he had paid 10 contributions, 24s. a week. If a workman was in receiptof a pension at a rate less than 100 per cent, he would be entitled to receiveup to the full rate of benefit provided that the amount he got by way of pension and benefit did not exceed what he would have got if he had had pension atthe 100 per cent. rate. This restriction would also disappear when he had further qualified by being insurably employed for ten weeks and paying tencontributions after the date of bis injury.9. The broad effect of the changes described above may be seen from thefollowing figures in cases where the injury results in 100per cent, pension ; furtherillustrations are given in the Tables attached to this Paper.Injury Allowance(Payable for a maximum of26 weeks.)Pension(i) If working(ii) If temporarily sick or un-s     employed.(a) Less than lOcontri-butions sinceinjury.(b) At least 10 contri-butions sinceinjury.(hi) If permanently   incapaci-tated for work.Single manwithoutdependant40s.Man with wife (or adultdependant) and one child40s.-f-16s.4-7s. 6d.^63s. 6d.40s. -j-earnings 40s. -f earnings.40s. 4- 12s.40s. 4-24s.40s.-r-20s.40s.-fl2s.

10. Other changes which have been made in the original proposals are asfollows : (a) Children. The White Paper proposed that the Scheme should notapply to children under school leaving age. Subject to certain conditions, however, children under school leaving age may be, andare, in fact, employed, and on further consideration it does not seemright to the Government that they should be entirely excluded frombenefit if they are injured during the course of their employment. Itis now proposed, therefore, that contributions should not be requiredfor them ; that injury allowance should be payable only so far as might be prescribed by Regulations ; but that they should be en-titled to disablement pension, subject to the usual conditions, at the juvenile rate (i.e. half the ordinary adult rate). The allowance or pension would be paid to the child&apos;s parent or guardian.(b) &quot;Arising out of and in the course of&quot;. The proposal in the white paper was that, as in the existing Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts,benefit should be payable in respect of accidents &quot; arising out ofand in the course of employment.&quot; The Government are still ofthe opinion that, as a general description of the nature of accidentsfor which benefit will be paid, no other form of words would be foundin practice to be more satisfactory than these, but they propose a modification in favour of the workman to the extent that accidentsarising in the course of employment shall be deemed, in theabsence of evidence to the contrary, also to have arisen out of that employment.(c) Accident when travelling to or from work. Under  the  Workmen&apos;compensation Acts a workman meeting with an accident while using aconveyance provided by his employer is able to recover compensationonly when he can show that there was a contractual obligation to use the conveyance. It is now proposed that the workman should beentitled to benefit in respect of an accident occurring while he is,with the express or implied permission of his employer, travellingby any vehicle to or from his place of work, notwithstanding that heis under no obligation to his employer to travel by that vehicle, if the vehicle is being operated by or on behalf of his emploj-er or some other person by whom -it is provided in pursuance of arrangements madewith his employer and is not being operated in the ordinary courseof a public transport service.id) Accident during an emergency. The White Paper proposed thatbenefits should be payable in respect of accidents occurring while a workman was engaged in rescue work and other specified classes ofemergency work in connection with industrial undertakings. Itis now proposed, while maintaining the cover in the existing Work-men&apos;s Compensation Acts for mine rescue brigades and extending itto certain other similar organizations, to frame the proposed general provision so as to cover accidents arising during an emergency at the employees premises, whether industrial or not, when the workmantakes steps to rescue or protect persons or property.(e) Dependency of parents or relatives in fatal cases. The White Paperproposed that in fatal cases pensions paid to parents or to otherrelatives (except the widow in whose case residence with the deceasedat the time of his death would suffice) should be subject to the con-dition that the claimant was wholly or mainly dependent on the workman at the time of his injury and either continued to be dependant up to the time of death or would, but for the injury, have
been so dependent.   It is now proposed that the condition should bethat the parent or relative was wholly or mainly dependent at thetime of death or would have been so dependent but for the accident.11. Contributions. In order to cover the cost of these proposals it has beendecided to increase the total contribution for adults by Id.   The original proposal was that a man should pay 3d. and his employer 3d. ; a woman 2d.,and her employer 2d.   It is now proposed, in order to avoid half-pennies inthe deduction which the employer makes from the adult worker&apos;s wages, to add the extra Id. to the employer&apos;s contribution, on the understanding thatat the first suitable opportunity equality of contribution between employer and worker will be restored.C-Outline 01 the Scheme in the BillPart I12. Scope of the Scheme. Broadly speaking the Scheme will cover all personsworking under a contract of service or apprenticeship and will correspondclosely with Class I of the classification under the General Scheme (Part I of theWhite Paper). There will be no income limit in the case of non-manual workers and no provision for &quot; contracting out &quot; schemes. As already noted it will include children under school leaving age who are employed but will not re-quire contributions for them. It will provide benefit for persons injured while serving as members of rescue brigades in mines and elsewhere, and generallyfor persons injured during rescue work due to an emergency arising at their employees premises. It will also contain special provision for certain accidentsoccurring while the workman is travelling to and from work.13. Contributions. Contributions will be payable by all insured workmenand their employers and the Exchequer will make a contribution equal to one-fifth of the combined contribution of workpeople and employers. The rate of contribution for an adult male worker will be Id. a week, Ad. being payable by the employer and 3d. by the workman. The corresponding figures for anadult woman will be 5d. (employer 3d., woman 2d.) ; for a boy under 18, 3d.(employer 1 Id., boy lid.) ; and for a girl under 18, 2d. (employer Id., girl Id.).There will be no contribution in respect of children under school leaving age.14. Contributions will be paid by means of stamps affixed to cards, as theyhave always been under the Health and Unemployment Insurance Schemes.It is intended that when this Scheme and the General Scheme come intooperation the contributions under both Schemes should generally be collected by means of one stamp on one card.Part II15. Benefds. The principal benefits in non-fatal cases will be :  (a) Injury Allowance of 40s. a week payable during incapacity for workfor not more than twenty-six weeks ;(b) Disablement Pension payable where the workman continues . to  be incapable of work after the 26 weeks period or where, after incapacityceases (either before or after the end of that period), he continues to suffer from some permanent or substantial disability due to the injury. - The pension will be 40.9, where the degree of disablement is assessed at 100 per cent., and proportionate amounts where the degree of disablement is assessed at something less than 100 per cent.It will be increased by 20s. a week where the pensioner, notwith-standing remedial measures, remains virtually unemployable ; andit may be increased by amounts up to 20s. a week where the pensioneris in need of constant attendance.
(c) Dependants Allowances. An allowance of 16s. a week payable for a wife or other adult dependant and an allowance of 7s. Qd. for a. firstchild while the workman is in receipt of-injury allowance or when heis receiving an addition to his pension of a supplement of 20s.because he is virtually unemployable. The allowance for a wife orother adult dependant will not be payable where the wife or dependantis earning more than 20s. a week, and not more than one suchallowance will be payable. &quot;Child&quot; has the same meaning in this bill as in the Family Allowances Bill.16. The rates of benefit will be the same for men and women. A married woman whose husband is wholly or mainly dependent on her earnings andincapable of self-support will be entitled to an allowance of 16s. in respect of him. She will also be eligible for an allowance in respect of a dependantor a first child subject to the same conditions as a male worker. Rates ofbenefit for unman icd workmen under eighteen years of age will be half therate for an adult, to be raised to the adult rate on attaining eighteen years ofage, but any dependants allowance will be payable at the full rates. (for children under school leaving age, see paragraph 10 (a) above).17. Where an industrial pensioner has to ente^ hospital or an institution &apos;for approved treatment for disability due to Iris injury his pension whilstundergoing such treatment will be at the 100 per cent, rate with dependanfsallowance where appropriate, but if lie is being maintained free of charge the pension will be subject to a deduction of 10s. a week in respect of home saving18. Minor injuries. Where an. injury results in only a minor disablement(amounting to at least 1 per cent, but less than 20 per cent.) a final settlementwill be made by an award, of a gratuity, which may be payable by instalments,the amount not to exceed  100.19. Fatal cases. The principal benefits in fatal cases, which will be subjectto the conditions mentioned in the next paragraph, will be as follows : (a) A widow married to the deceased before the date of his injury will receive (i) if she is fifty years of age or over, or being under that age,has the care of a child of the workman, or is permanentlyincapable of self-support, a pension of 30s. a week ;(ii) in other cases, a pension of 20s. a week.If she would have qualified under the General Scheme for a widow&apos;benefit at a higher rate during an initial period (normalh&apos; 36s.a week for 13 weeks following the death) the pension will beraised to that higher rate for the appropriate period. Wherea widow under fifty is awarded a pension at the 30s. rate becauseshe has the care of a child of the workman, the pension will continue at this rate when the child ceases to be qualified for an allowanceif she has then attained the age of 50 years. Where the widow wasseparated from her husband at the time of his death piovision willbe made for the award of a pension in accordance with any paymentshe was receiving or entitled to receive from him subject to a maximum of the appropriate rate above. On remarriage the pension willk cease but there will be a marriage gratuity equal to one year&apos;pension. Where a workman was in receipt at the time of his death of an &quot; unemployability supplement &quot; the widow&apos;s pension will be payable irrespective of the date of marriage.
(b) An allowance of 7s. 6d. weekhy will be payable in respect of one ofthe workman&apos;s children. (No specific provision is made for orphans,tor whom allowances at a special rate will be provided under theGeneral Scheme (Part I of the White Paper Cmd. 6550).)(c) A widower whose wife, being an industrial worker, was married to himprevious to her injury will be eligible for a pension of 20s, a week ifhe is permanently incapable of self-support.(d) A pension will be payable, whether or not a widow&apos;s pension is payable,to a parent who is permanently incapable of self-support. The maxi-mum pension for one parent will be 20s. a week ; if both parentsqualify, the pension will be 15s. a week each.(e) Where no pension is payable to a widow or a parent one other adultrelative of the deceased workman (if within the prescribed degree)who was resident with him at the time of the injury will be eligible fora pension if permanently incapable of self-support. The maximum rate of pension will be 20s. a week.(/) Where no pension is payable under the foregoing provisions a womanwho was resident with the workman at the date of the injury and throughout the period between that date and his death will be eligiblefor a temporaryvpension if she has the care of his child or children.The maximum rate will be 20s. a week and the pension will be payableso long as at least one child is within the qualifying age for an allow-ance under the Scheme.(s) A (prescribed) relative of the deceased workman who is not eligiblefor any pension under this Scheme will be eligible for a temporary allowance of 36s. a week for thirteen weeks.20. Pensions for widows will be subject to the condition that they wereresident with or wholly or mainly maintained by the deceased at the time ofhis death. Pensions or allowances to parents or other relatives will be subjectto the condition that the claimant was wholly or mainly maintained by the workman at the time of his death or would but for the injury have been so main-tained. In other cases the condition will be that the claimant was wholly or mainly maintained by the insured person at the time of his injury and eithercontinued to be so maintained up to the date of death or would, but for the injury, have been so maintained. The maximum rate in sub-paragraphs (d),(e) and (/) above will be given where the dependent had been wholly maintained by the workman ; in other cases the amount will be proportionate to the degreeof maintenance which had been given. In the case of a female dependant the pension will cease on subsequent marriage.21. Duplication of Benefit. The rate of injury allowance or disablementpension payable to a. workman who receives a second or subsequent injury willbe subject to the rule that, apart from allowances for a wife or child, he cannotreceive more in total than the maximum of 40/- (20/- for a juvenile). regulations may provide for adjustments in certain cases for duplication of benefits, inparticular as regards more than one set. of allowances in respect of dependants,and also other cases \e.g. that of a widow who herself suffers an industrial injury) where payments would accrue partly in a person&apos;s own right and partly owing to his relationship to some one else.Part III22. Determination of claims. All claims to benefit will in the first instancebe dealt with by an Insurance Officer. A claim will normally be met on anapplication by or on behalf of the workman, or in fatal cases, by or on behalf of
the dependent. The claimant will be required to give notice of the accident tohis employer and to submit his claim to the Insurance Officer forthwith with covering certificate and other appropriate particulars. The employer will berequired to report the accident to the Insurance Officer. The Officer will normally decide the claim and if he decides it against the claimant the claimantwill have a right of appeal to the local Appeal Tribunal. This Tribunal will consist of one or more members chosen to represent employers with an equal number of members chosen to represent insured persons and a Chairmanappointed by the Minister. Appeals will lie from the decision of the localTribunal to an Industrial Injuries Commissioner whose decision will be final.The proposals for the appointment of the Commissioner and the constitution ofthe local Tribunals and the rules governing procedure throughout are closelymodelled on the existing provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Acts.23. Assessment for pension. When a workman ceases to be incapable ofwork or has been incapable for twenty-six weeks but is entitled to be assessedfor pension by reason of continuing disability, his disablement (if any) will haveto be assessed in order to determine whether a pension should be put in payment.For this purpose he will normally be examined by a Medical Board and theInsurance Officer will determine the pension to be paid in accordance with theMedical Boarcks report. The workman will have certain rights of appeal againstthe decision of the Medical Board to a Medical Appeal Tribunal and the decisionof that Tribunal will be final. A Medical Board will consist of not less than two medical practitioners appointed by the Minister of whom one will beappointed Chairman, and a Medical Appeal Tribunal will consist of a Chairmanselected by the Minister and two medical practitioners. The Minister insteadof himself appointing Medical Boards may arrange with any other GovernmentDepartment that any Medical Board consisting of not less than two medical practitioners appointed or recognised by that Department shall be a medical board for the purposes of the Industrial Injuries Scheme.24. Review of decisions. There are provisions for enabling decisions givenby an Insurance Officer, a Local Appeal Tribunal, the Commissioner, a medical board or a Medical Appeal Tribunal to be reviewed in certain circumstancesdefined in the Bill.Part IV25. Extension of the Scheme to Diseases, etc. It is proposed to adheregenerally to the principles at present recognised in extending the Workmen&apos;compensation Acts to diseases scheduled or otherwise specified which are dueto the nature of the employment. Accordingh&apos;, the Bill gives the Ministerpower to prescribe such diseases (either generally in relation to all insuredpersons, or in relation to insured persons employed in prescribed occupations)and incapacity for work or other disabilities resulting from such prescribeddisease in the case of a person who fulfils the necessary conditions will betreated on the same footing as an &quot; injury &quot; due to an accident, subject toany necessary modifications which rany be made by Regulations. Thereare provisions regarding certain respiratory diseases which will enable thespecial medical and other arrangements in regard to pneumoconiosis to be con-tinued.Part V&quot; 26. Finance. An Industrial Injuries Fund will be set up out of whichall benefits and administrative charges will be paid. The Fund will be main-tained  by  weekly  contributions  from employers and workmen,  with a
contribution from the Exchequer. Further information regarding the financial provisions of the Scheme is given in the Financial Memorandum attached tothe Bill.27. Administration. The Minister of National Insurance will be responsiblethrough his officers for the day-to-day administration of the SchcTne. an industrial Injuries Advisory Council will be set up which will include an equal number of persons representing employers and insured persons respectively.It will be the duty of this Council to consider and advise the Minister on such questions relating to the Act as he refers to them. The Bill also empowersthe Minister to promote or assist research into the cause and incidence of and methods of prevention of accidents, injuries and diseases andto make arrangements with the Ministry of Labour and National Servicelor securing that persons entitled to benelit under the Scheme take full advantage of vocational training courses and industrial rehabilitation courses.Provisions for the issue of insurance stamps, books and cards and for theissue of copies of birth, marriage or death certificates at special rates are onthe lines familiar in the Insurance Schemes, as are also the provisions relatingto legal proceedings in connection with the Act.Part VI2S. Miscellaneous and General. Power is given to the Minister to make regulations modifying the provisions of the Scheme in the case of seamen and airmen (that is, persons employed on civil aircraft) to take account of thespecial circumstances arising from their employment outside Great Britain.The Minister will also have power to make regulations determining whatpersons are to be treated as employers in certain cases. Provision is madefor reciprocal arrangements with other countries.29. Application of the New Scheme to Past Cases. The Vvorkmcn&apos;s Com-pensation Acts, including the Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Temporary Increases)Act, 1943, will continue to apply (subject to certain amendments proposed inthe Family Allowances Bill) to cases arising before the new scheme comes intoforce, with suitable adaptation to cases due to industrial disease. It is pro-vided in the Bill, however, that a workman receiving weekly payments ofcompensation under the Acts who, if he came under the new Scheme, wouldbe deemed to be virtually unemployable as a result of his injury may apply for and be granted an additional allowance of 20s. a week (see paragraph above). The cost of this allowance will be borne by the Industrial InjuriesFund.
