Aircraft of the Pacific Fleet have attacked airfields in Formosa.Ships of the East Indies Fleet have bombarded Sabang.A French naval force has carried out bombardments at the mouth of theGironde.Shipping casualties due to U-boats have been considerable.       - - )Three U-boats have been sunk, three probably sunk and five possibly sunk.Home Waters.2. There was considerable activity by midget U-boats during the week.H.M.S. Garth (destroyer) sank one midget off Orfordness and, in the course of alarge number of attacks by aircraft over an area stretching from the Hook of holland to the East Coast, at least one midget was sunk and four probably sunk.3. On the 11th H.M.S. Ekins (frigate) sank a small enemy sailing craftfrom Dunkirk. Later, in co-operation with M.T.B.&apos;s Ekins sank two explosivemotor-boats oft Walcheren and took four prisoners. On the night of the12th/13th H.M. ships Hambledon (destroyer) and Ekins, with M.T.B.&apos;s, engagedand drove off a force of E-boats which had approached the East Coast. On the16th Ekins was mined while on patrol N.W. of Ostend but reached port.On the 18th five explosive motor-boats ran aground at Breskens. Sevenprisoners were captured.4. On the 16th U.S. coastal craft intercepted and damaged an enemy shipS.W. of Cherbourg. While returning, they were heavily shelled by shore batteriesfrom Alderney.Shelling of the French coast from the iUderney batteries has continuedintermittently since the 11th.During the week ending the 15th the combined British and U.S. dischargesthrough the liberated ports were approximately: 81,300 men, 9,025 vehicles,544,000 tons of stores, 47,500 tons of coal, 164,000 tons of petrol, 99,500 tons ofammunition.Bay of Biscay.5. On the 15th and 16th a French squadron which included the Lorraine(battleship), Duquesne (cruiser), three destroyers and three frigates, inconjunction with R.A.F. spotting aircraft, carried out bombardments at the mouth of the Gironde in support of the land forces. On the completion of the bombardment French light forces re-established a blockade.On the second day H.M. ships of a minesweeping flotilla captured an armedtrawler off the Gironde and took the crew of 15 prisoners.West Atlantic.6.   H.M.C.S. Esquimalt (minesweeper) wras torpedoed and sunk by a U-boaton the 16th in the approaches to Halifax.Mediterranean.7. Between the 11th and the 16th H.M.S. Orion (cruiser) and U.S. andFrench destroyers continued the bombardment of enemy positions, communications and troops on the French-Italian frontier. On the 17th one of the destroyers,the French Trombe, was attacked by two E-boats S.E. of San Remo andtorpedoed, but proceeded to port : there were 20 killed.   One E-boat was sunk.,8. In the Gulf of Genoa, on the night of the 11th/12th coastal forces foughttwo inconclusive actions with enemy convoys. Early on the 12th three AlliedM.T.B&apos;s in an attack on an escorted convoy torpedoed a cargo ship and a corvette,both of which probably sank. On the night of the 15th/16th coastal forces, inconjunction with aircraft, torpedoed one ship and probably a second in convoy.On the same night a French coastal craft sank a small ship.9. In the Adriatic, on the night of the 10th/11th two M.G.B&apos;s engaged a convoy of three armed Lighters and two E-boats off Zara. On the following nightthree M.T.B&apos;s sank five small craft of a convoy in the Gulf of Trieste. On the12th coastal craft sank the Italian destroyer Spica off the Dalmatian coast.On the following day a patrol vessel engaged three enemy ships S.E. of Fiumeand sank one of them.

On the same night Jugoslav coastal craft and oneof H.M. M.T.B&apos;s sank one, probably two, enemy craft in convoy in the same area.East Indies.10. On the 11th a force consisting of H.M.S. Queen Elizabeth, the Frenchbattleship Richelieu, H.M. ships London, Cumberland (cruisers), Emperor andKhedive (escort carriers) with five destroyers, operated off the north coast ofSumatra. Queen Elizabeth, Richelieu and L,ondon bombarded Sabang while the destroyers shelled Olehleh (to the southward). The fleet was unsuccessfully attacked by ten enemy aircraft, two of which were shot down.Carrier-borne aircraft attacked Emmahaven and Padang (west Sumatra),damaging a 4,000-ton cargo ship. Three enemy aircraft were destroyed on theground and one was shot down.11. Between the 9th and 11th ELM. ships Rotherham, Racehorse, Rocketand Redoubt (destroyers) carried out a sweep off the west coast of Burma, withoutmeeting any opposition. They sank five small craft -and picked up 69 survivorsfrom ships sunk by the R.A.F.12. H.M. S/M Thorough during a recent patrol off northern Sumatra sank two 900-ton coasters, an M.G.B. and three laden landing craft. H.M. S/MRorqual in the same area sank two coasters and three junks.Pacific.13. In attempting to counter the constant attacks on Okinawa by U.S.carrier-borne aircraft, the Japanese have twice made heavy attacks using suicideaircraft; on each occasion their losses were considerable. On the 17th U.S.naval aircraft sank five cargo ships and damaged three others east of theRyukyus.14. On the 12th aircraft of the British Pacific Fleet attacked two airfieldson Formosa; 16 enemy aircraft were shot down and five damaged. Next dayone of the airfields and the Matsuyama oil installations were attacked. Consicler-able damage was done. The Fleet was unsuccessfully attacked on three occasionsand at least 20 enemy aircraft were destroyed, and a number of others damaged or destroyed by bombing.   Our losses were light.15. Reconnaissance over the Johore Strait showed one damaged Otago-cl&amp;sscruiser and 11 cargo ships totalling 33,600 tons damaged. In Singapore harbourone undamaged Nachi-cl&amp;ss cruiser was seen in dry dock and there were also present two U-boats, one escort vessel and 13 cargo ships totalling 49,000 tons.Anti-Submarine Operations.16. During the week 42 attacks on U-boats were reported, of which eightwere by shore-based aircraft and 34 by warships.On the 12th frigates of the 8th escort group sank a U-boat in the IrishSea and took 38 prisoners. On the next day 43 survivors were picked up froma U-boat which was abandoned and sunk off Peterhead. On the 16th, H.M.S.Lock Killin (frigate) sank one off Start Point and took 17 prisoners. On the8th and 15th, frigates of the 21st and 5th escort groups probably sank tw7oU-boats in the S.W. Approaches and on the 12th, H.M. S/M Tapir probably sank one off Bergen. U.S. destroyers possibly sank one in mid-Atlantic on the 15thand the Norwegian M.T.B. 715 possibly sank another off the Norwegian coaston the 6th. Aircraft possibly sank three U-boats on the 6th, 16th and 17th, off cape Wrath, off Kinnaird Head and to the east of the Firth of Forthrespectively.Enemy Intelligence.17. The total effective strength of the German Navy is now estimated tobe one pocket battleship (Lutzow), one 8&quot; cruiser (Eugen), on 6&quot; cruiser(nurnberg), 17 destroyers, 22- torpedo boats, approximately 175 minesweepersand escort vessels, 200-240 E-boats and approximately 200 landing craft.   In[29754] b
addition one 8&quot; cruiser (Hipper), two 6&quot; cruisers (Emaen, Leipzig), and eight destroyers and torpedo-boats are at present repairing or refitting.On the 14th reconnaissance located the Lutzoiv and the Schlesien atSwinemiinde and the Eugen off Sassnitz.U-boats.18. A large number of U-boats are operating in the S.W. Approaches and -there has been increased activity off the East Coast.Reconnaissance showed 63 U-boats at Kiel on the 14th.It is estimated that in bombing attacks on the main German ports sincethe 29th of last month, 14 LT-boats have been sunk and six others damaged. Thesedo not include U-boats building or fitting-out.Enemy Attack on Shipping.19. Nine ships totalling approximately 50,400 tons, including three tankers,are known to have been sunk during the week.A homeward-bound Atlantic convoy was attacked by U-boats in the S.W.Approaches and two ships, were sunk. Two ships, one of them Norwegian, were torpedoed and sunk in an eastbound convoy off the North Foreland. A tankerin coastal convoy was sunk off the Northumbrian coast. A U.S. ship was torpedoed in the Irish Sea but reached port. Two ships were sunk off CapeHatteras.The s.s. Monarch (cable vessel) was sunk either by mine or torpedo offOrfordness.One ship in convoy was sunk probably by a mine off Ostend and another ship in convoy was mined in the same area but reached port.Allied Minelaying.20,&quot; During the week surface craft have continued to lay a large number of mines in Home Waters.Aircraft laid mines in the Kattegat and the Baltic.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.21. On one night in the week groups of E-boats probably laid mines on the convoy route to Antwerp, where five mines have been destroyed.Sweeping operations have been carried out in the Scheldt approaches, inthe East Coast war channels, off the Humber and in connection with the operationsoff the Gironde.The minespotting flight based on Leghorn reported 85 mines as well as twolines of shallow mines in this area. In the iEgean suspected minelays in theGulf of Salonika are being investigated.Fifteen German mines have been destroyed off Ancona, 35 mines have been destroyed in Candia Bay (Crete), and eight off the coast of Stampalia.The mine totals are 6,525 ground and 9,644 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.22. Fifty ships, totalling 323,000 tons, are reported to have been plyingbetween Copenhagen and the eastern Baltic for the evacuation of civilian refugees and wounded.   Two of the ships have been sunk and another damaged.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.23. Offensive operations during the week have continued to make rapid and extensive progress, and only on the southern and northern flanks has theenemy managed to offer any sort of cohesive resistance. In the centre, he hasbeen unable to make good the loss of two armies in the Ruhr pocket; consequently the few formations facing the Central Group of Armies have proved totally inadequate to stem the tide of Allied armoured thrusts.
Despite the resistance on the flanks mentioned above, Field-MarshalMontgomery&apos;s Northern Group of Armies has closed in steadily on Hamburgand Bremen, while initially clearing the whole of N.E. Holland and advancingalso into the western part of that country.Two subsidiary operations are also nearing a successful conclusion. Thefirst is the final elimination of the Ruhr pocket; the other is the operation by french troops to clear the Gironde estuary and free Bordeaux; this is meeting with rapid success.Southern Sector.24. During the past week the First French Army has continued to makesteady progress south and east of Karlsruhe. On the right, Baden-Baden was occupied on the 14th and French forces advancing down the east bank of the rhine have reached a point 15 miles south of Strasbourg. On the left, the advance has pressed south in the Black Foregt area against decreasing resistance,and east towards the Stuttgart area where resistance has remained firm.On the 14th, leading troops of the Seventh U.S. Army entered Bamburg andby the next day armoured forces from this area had cut the Nuremberg-Bamburgautobahn 20 miles to the east. Nuremberg was entered by U.S. troops on the17th. On the remainder of the Seventh Army Front progress southwards hasbeen steady but unspectacular.French forces commanded by General de Larminat attacked on the 14thto clear the pockets of Germans on either side of the Gironde estuary and thusfree the port of Bordeaux. This operation received substantial air and navalsupport and made rapid progress, Royan falling on the 16th. The Germansat present appear to be in full retreat on both sides of the river.Central Sector.25. The Third U.S. Army&apos;s resumed attack eastwards has carried all before it, clearing Neustadt and Erfurt on the 13th, and Bayreuth and Altenburg onthe following day. By the 15th Chemnitz had been reached; overall distances of up to 90 miles had by then been covered by U.S. armour in four days. further south, leading troops have reached the Czechoslovak frontier.On the Third U.S. Army&apos;s left, armour of the First U.S. Army haskept pace with the advance and has now outflanked and practically surroundedLeipzig. North of the city, other armoured forces, after by-passing the Hartzmountains from the south, have reached Dessau, junction of the Mulde and Elberivers. Infantry formations are engaged in mopping up the difficult and naturallydefensible Hartz area in rear; this pocket has been cut off by the junction ofthe First and Ninth U.S. Armies near Bernberg.The Ninth U.S. Army finally cleared Hanover and Brunswick, whichthey had previously by-passed, on the 13th. Meanwhile desperate fighting was going on south of Magdeburg for a bridgehead across the Elbe. The enemycontrived to eliminate the first Allied foot-hold but a second was quicklyestablished, and this has been slightly enlarged despite heavy pressure. By the15th. the Army front lay on the Elbe from Magdeburg (which fell on the 18th)to Wittenberge.The Ruhr pocket has been steadily compressed: The First U.S. Army hasbeen attacking from south and east, the Ninth from the north, while the Fifteenthhas held the line of the Rhine to the west. On the 15th, contact was made between the two converging armies at Hagen and the easternmost of the twopockets thus formed was quickly wiped out. Over 317,000 prisoners, includingseveral generals, have already been feaken.Northern Sector.26. On the right of the Second British Army, stiff resistance has continued,especially in the area of Ulzen, where hard fighting was still in progress for three days after the original attack. Between this town and Verden, however, a softspot was discovered through which British armour is now thrusting up the approaches to Hamburg. In the Bremen area, infantry are finding it hard goingin the outer defences of the town.The strong initial opposition between the Weser and Ems has now slackened,and the salient cleared as far as the general line Bremen-Oldenburg. West ofthe Ems, Polish armour and Canadian infantry of the First Canadian Army arequickly clearing the whole of N.E. Holland.&apos;[29754] b 2
The attack westwards into the rear of the Ijssel defences about Apeldoornhas made good progress. By the 15th, both this town and Arnhem were cleared,while on the nest day Canadian armour striking N.W. from Arnhem penetratedto the Zuider Zee.Italy.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)27. The battle in Italy has developed favourably during the past week,the Fifth Army having added its thrust to the general offensive. An amphibiousoperation by UK. troops across Lake Comacchio on the 12th, lent impetus to theright flank of the Eighth Army&apos;s attack and two days later its forces were within miles of Argenta. By this time, the New Zealanders had secured, a crossingof the Santerno and a U.K. division had been passed through and directed north-wards towards Bastia. On the 15th the-New Zealanders forced their third rivercrossing within a week, they crossed the Sillaro, and by the end of the period the main Eighth Army line was up to the Gaiana river; Medicina, Imola andCastel San Pietro having been captured. Argenta, after a hedgehog defence,had fallen, and leading troops were only 16 miles from Ferrara. To the south ofHighway 9, Italian troops had moved forward over unoccupied country andeliminated a deep salient. Much of this advance had been against light oppositiononly, but there had been a hard battle for Argenta and the. enemy bad clung onto Castel San Pietro very stubbornly.On the 14th the Fifth Army opened its offensive with an attack by two divisions in the Vergato sector. This met considerable opposition,but nevertheless, and in spite of difficult mountain country, good progress wasmade. Vergato, after a hard fight, was cleared, and the Allied line is now some7 miles beyond it. In the early hours of the 16th the second phase of the FifthArmy&apos;s attack opened south of Bologna and met with even stiffer resistance.For two days scarely any progress was made but by the 18th the line had movedforward a short way S.W. of Pianoro.Throughout the week the 92nd U.S. division continued to make gains in thedirection of Spezia in the west coastal sector.Russian Front.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.28. On the 14th the Russians began an attack with the object of clearing the Samland Peninsula to the N.W. of Kdnigsberg. After three days&apos; fightingthey reported the wffiole peninsula cleared but for the port of Pillau.Central Sector.29. After claiming the repulse of several Russian probing attacks, theGermans announced on the 16th that the Russians had launched their expectedlarge-scale attack between the Baltic and the Sudeten mountains. Germanadmissions suggest that there are three main Russian attacks : (i) across theRiver Oder south of Stettin; (ii) in the Kustrin-Franfurt area and (iii) acrossthe River Niesse east of Cottbus.So far, however, the Russians have made no official announcement of thisoffensive.The Germans have also reported the resumption of Russian attacks towardsthe Moravian Gap from the area S.E. of Ratibor.Southern Sector.&quot; 30. Vienna was finally taken on the 13th; during the fighting for thecapital the Russians report the capture of over 130,000 prisoners. To the N.E.of Vienna, the centre of the Austrian oil region was taken on the 17th and subsequent progress has been made to within 10 miles of Brno, whilst to thewest of the capital, Russian forces have pushed on up the Danube Valley,, to within 5 miles of Krems.Only local fighting has been reported from the rest of this sector.Burma.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)31.   Taungup, the last enemy-held port in the Arakan, fell on the 16th.In Central Burma two parallel drives southwards have developed.   Onecolumn from the Yamethin area has now reached a point 20 miles north of
Pyinmana, against only light opposition. Further west, a second column hascovered much ground without opposition, Natmauk falling on the 14th, andTaungdwingyi on the 16th. Leading elements of the second column are now in contact with the enemy 8 miles north of Satthwa.The road Meiktila-Kyaukpadaung has been cleared. A drive along the roadKyaukpadaung-Chauk is also making satisfactory progress, and forward troops have reached a point only 7 miles from Chauk.China.32. On the 17th, Japanese activity was reported in the area 50 miles west of Poaching. The main objective of these operations is still uncertain. It ispossible that it is merely a foraging expedition.Pacific.33. Luzon. U.S. forces after reaching, the northern coast of the neck ofland stretching east from Lucena, penetrated as far as Calauag on the 11th.In the extreme S.E. tip of Luzon U.S. forces have occupied the whole ofthe Sorsogon Peninsula and have advanced inland some 30 miles N.W. of Legaspi.Other Philippine Islands; On the 11th, U.S. troops landed on the S.W.coast of Bohol, the last of the main Central Philippine Islands still in Japanesehands.   Rapid progress was made inland and the island was cleared by the 13th.On Negros, U.S. troops have made further progress from Fabrica down theeastern coast of the island.The following is a summary of Japanese casualties in those PhilippineIslands where fighting has recently been taking place : Killed. Prisoners.Luzon (up to 13th April)   ...... 110,486 1,118Negros (up to 8th April)    ...... 553 10Cebu (up to 8th April)       ...... 1,320 34Sulu  area   (Holo,   Tawi-Tawi,   and including   Mindanao)   (up   tooth  April)         ......... 2,330 15Ryukyus.34. Okinawa. 3 U.S. Marine Corps has now cleared the whole of thenorthern part of the island.Bitter fighting continues in the south where the Japanese positions, particu-larly in the Shuri area, formed part of a highly organised defence system in greatdepth.U.S. forces have also landed on Ie-Shima, to the west of Okinawa, and nowcontrol two-thirds of the island.AIR SITUATION.  -Europe.Home Waters.35. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 950 sorties; 4 aircraft are missing.In attacks on enemy shipping off the coast of Norway, by small numbersof Wellingtons and Halifaxes, two ships of 8,000 and 2,000 tons were hit. andone of 2,000 tons set on fire. Beaufighters obtained hits on a depot ship, a U-boat and a 2,500-ton ship in Jossing Fiord (South Norway).Aircraft of Bomber Command laid 535 sea-mines.Western Europe.36. During the week ended dawn on the 19th, aircraft of Bomber command and U.S. VIII Bomber Command flew 9,985 sorties and dropped 25,562 tons.U.S. VIII Fighter Command and Fighter Command flew 3,028 and 1,094 sorties respectively. In the week ended dawn on the 18th, aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air)flew 22,874 sorties and dropped 7,856 tons. Of 197 Allied aircraft which are missing, 25 are heavy bombers. Two hundred and twenty-four enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and 2,053 on the ground.
A feature of the week was the destruction of, and damage to large numbersof eneniy aircraft on the ground by escorts to heavy bombers and tactical aircraft.Bomber Command carried out attacks in strength by day and night mainlyagainst naval installations, barracks and railway facilities in Germany and czechoslovakia. U.S. heavy bombers operated in strength on five days of theweek, chiefly in support of the attacking French forces, against enemy positions on both sides of the Gironde estuary and railway targets in the Dresden area in support of the Allied armies on both the Western and Eastern Fronts.Enemy air activity was on a very small scale. Small numbers of reconnais-sance and ground attack aircraft operated; fighters flew about 100-200 sortiesdaily.   Negligible opposition was offered to heavy bomber attacks.A successful daylight attack was carried out in clear weather, on the mainisland of Heligoland and the adjacent island of Dune by 945 escorted Lancastersand Halifaxes, with the object of destroying naval and military installationson Heligoland and the airfield facilities on Dune. The targets were identifiedvisually and over 4,900 tons of H.E. were dropped accurately in concentratedattacks. No enemy aircraft were encountered, and the whole of the main island was left enveloped in smoke.Lancasters and Halifaxes attacked by night the naval dockyards at Kiel(previously attacked 4 nights before) and dropped 1,906 tons through 8/10thsto 10/10ths cloud on well concentrated markers. An attack was carried out bya small number of escorted Lancasters, in clear weather, with the intention ofsinking the Lutzow in the Kaiser Canal at Swinemunde. About 80 tons (including11 x 12,000 lbs.) were dropped but bombing was hampered by extremely accurateflak. There is no evidence of direct hits but near misses may have caused blastdamage.A heavy and accurate attack was made on Potsdam by Lancasters, with theintention of destroying barracks and railway facilities; 1,716 tons of H.E. were dropped which caused fires visible from a distance of over 100 miles, and whichwere still burning on the following night.On three successive days in clear weather, a total of 2,895 Fortresses andLiberators (without escort) dropped 5,683 tons and 1,120 tons of incendiarymaterial on a number of strong points, batteries, and a tank defence line in theGironde area in preparation for and in support of the successful attack by french forces on the enemy pocket of resistance in the Roy an area. Medium bombers of the Tactical Air Force also co-operated.On two nights and three consecutive days strong, successful, concentratedattacks were made by heavy bombers, in clear weather, on railway centres and bridges in the Regensburg, Dresden, Innsbruck and Prague areas in support ofthe Allied advances on the Western and Eastern Fronts. Some 24 targets were attacked including Dresden (1,647 tons) and Pilsen (882 tons by night), and atotal of nearly 8,000 tons was dropped by over 2,900 Lancasters, Mosquitoes,Fortresses and Liberators.Night attacks by Mosquitoes on Berlin and other targets were continued;over 540 tons were dropped on the former in 13 attacks.Medium bombers of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) gave strong support on all sectors,attacking ordnance depots, railway centres, ammunition dumps and enemyheadquarters in front of our advancing forces. On one day over 1,100 sorties were flown; the daily average was about 6/700.Fighters and fighter-bombers were very active against enemy communica-tions, transport and airfields. A daily average of 2,300 sorties was flown witha peak of 3,550 on one day. Under good weather conditions over 4,700 M.T.,190 A.F.V., 650 locomotives and 700 horse-drawn vehicles were destroyed.* In attacks on airfields by fighters escorting heavy bombers and by tacticalaircraft over 2,000 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground and 1,350damaged. :The supply of the armies in the forward areas by air was continued. Of19,044 tons of supplies transported, over one half was petrol. Approximately35,000 casualties and ex-prisoners of war were evacuated. No aircraft are missingfrom 7,103 sorties.Note. -Appendix VII gives Raid Assessments.Southern Europe.37. In the week ended dusk on the 16th, aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew20,171 sorties (including 4,931 by heavy bombers) and dropped 13,989 tons of bombs. Of 90 Allied aircraft which are missing 20 are heavy bombers. Sixteenenemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and three on the ground.
Enemy activity was very small; minor bombing attacks were carried out against the Ravenna area.The Strategic Air Force carried out operations mainly in support of eighth army and against railway targets. On two occasions over 1,400 tons were dropped by Fortresses and Liberators against tactical targets south&apos; of Bologna.In Italy and Austria 12 railway bridges (2,066 tons), 3 railway centres(281 tons), 2 fuel depots (142 tons), 5 ammunition depots and factories (555 tons)were attacked with considerable success. Several bridges received direct hitsand one ammunition factory south of Udine was severely damaged; in additionLightnings destroyed 137 locomotives.The number of sorties reached, on the 15th, a record level of 3,760 for any one day in this theatre of war.Night sorties by the Tactical Air Force were chiefly against communications and forward military targets in support of the advance by the Eighth Army,an average of 170 sorties being flown each night.Medium bombers successfully attacked airfields, communications in the PoValley, gun positions and forward military targets in the Eighth Army sector.The average number of sorties flown was 250 daily.Fighters and fighter-bombers gave full support, to the offensives opened bythe Eighth and Fifth Armies and attacked communications over a wide area.A daily average of 1,000 sorties was flown, and on one day 1,350 sorties were carried out.   About 250 M.T. and 780 buildings were destroyed.Medium bombers of the Balkan Air Force operated against communica-tions south of Zagreb, troop concentrations on the islands of Cherso and Krk,and probably destroyed a 3,000-ton ship off Karlovac. Aircraft of the CoastalAir Force attacked small shipping in the Gulf of Genoa and destroyed an E-boat.Russian Front.38. The Russian Air Force has maintained a high effort over the Samlandpeninsula, and on the Oder front an exceptionally heavy air effort is reported.The Baltic Naval Air Component assisted by the Long-Range Bomber Force hasattacked German shipping in and around Pillau with great successFar East.South-East Asia.39.

Simila r aircraft attacked small shipping in theTongking Gulf and laid mines on the Yangtze River.
Tactical aircraft, including a considerable number of medium bombers,attacked communications, railway stock, river craft, troop concentrations andother military targets. These operations were conducted over a most extensivearea, including the district around Hanoi in French Indo-China and the provinces of Kwangsi, Hunan, Kiangski, Hupeh and Honan. Several bridges were destroyed, a number of river craft including steamers sunk, stores areas set on fire and many casualties inflicted on troops.Japan.41.
