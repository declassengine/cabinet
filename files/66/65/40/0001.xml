PART IDESCRIPTIVE AND HISTORICAL NOTE ON BURMAGENERAL DESCRIPTIONi. Burma with nearly 17,000,000 inhabitants and an area of 262,000square miles stands fourth in point of population among the territories of theCrown and eighth in point of size.2. The indigenous inhabitants, who entered Burma from the North in successive waves, are all of the same racial type and all speak Mongolianlanguages. In the plains the earlier inhabitants, the Talaings, had, shortly before the first British-Burmese War, been finally overthrown by the Burmesewho had settled in Central Burma in the Ninth Century and during the last century the Burmese have spread over Southern Burma where they have largely absorbed the existing population. The Burmese form much thelargest clement (about 66 per cent.) in the population of the country. Theyare Buddhists and Buddhism is the strongest influence on the life and cultureof the average Burmese. Consequently the power which the Buddhist monkscan exercise is very considerable. Owing to a system of monastic schools theliteracy rate is high compared with other Asiatic countries. There is nocaste system and women occupy a good position, engaging freely in socialintercourse and playing an important part in the economy of the country.3. In the Shan States and tribal tracts in the hills surrounding the centralplain on the East, North and West, the inhabitants are not Burmese butbelong to a large number of different tribes and peoples most of whom arebackward economically compared with the Burmese and who among them-selves cover a very wide range in social development. The main groupsare the Shans, Karens, Kachins, Chins and Nagas. The Shans, like the burmese, are Buddhist, but most of the hill peoples are animists and livetheir own lives in closely integrated&apos; communities on which the monetaryeconomy of the outer workl has so far impinged but little.4. In addition to the indigenous peoples there are three important non-mdigenous elements in the population; the Indians, who in peace-timenumbered about 1,000,000, the Chinese of whom there were about 150,000in 1931, and a smaller number of Europeans, Anglo-Indians and Anglo-Burmans. All these groups played a very important part in the economic life of the country.ECONOMIC LIFE5. Rice cultivation forms the backbone of Burma&apos;s economy, accounting for 12,000,000 acres, or 70 per cent of the country&apos;s total cropped area.Burma was before the war the world&apos;s largest exporter of rice, her total production being some 6,000,000 tons a year, of which half was exported(principally to India). Out of Burma&apos;s total exports in 1939-40 valued at 40^- million, rice accounted for  18 million.6. The timber, notably teak, of Burma, is also of great value; some 200,000tons of teak were normally exported yearly, and the value of all timberexported was about  2% millions a year.7. Of minerals, petroleum was the most important; the oil-fields produced in the decade ending 1939 over 250,000,000 gallons a year and although thisproduction was less than J of one per cent, of total world production, theexport of petroleum and petroleum products was valued on an average attio million a year.  This supply went almost exclusively to India.42432 A 2
8. Apart from petroleum, mining and timber and rice milling Burma hadno large-scale industry. The country is predominantly agricultural, two-thirds of the population being dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.9. Burma&apos;s main lines of communication run north and south. She had little overland trade and the great bulk of her exports and imports passed through the port of Rangoon (though this situation may be changed owingto the opening up of overland routes as a result of the war). The principalimports were consumer goods such as cotton piece goods from India andlatterly, from Japan, and production materials such as milling machinery and railway stores. India, Burma&apos;s chief customer, was also her chiefsupplier followed by Britain and Japan. The value of the total imports was in 1939-40  18,800,000, of which India supplied 56 per cent., the U.K16 per cent, and Japan 7 per cent.10. A striking feature of Burma&apos;s economic life was the small part takenby the Burmese themselves in industries other than agriculture. Indianshad a great financial stake in the country, followed by the British; andIndians provided the bulk of the manual labour in industry. The financing of agriculture and the agriculturist was largely in Indian hands and as aresult of this and the effect of the slump in 1930 a considerable proportionamounting to at least one sixth, of land used for agriculture had passed intoIndian ownership. In industry and the extraction of timber British capital and British firms predominated; in 1929 British interests were estimated torepresent a capital of  42 millions.   The Chinese were mainly small traders.11. The fact that they participated only to a /ery limited extent in indusrty was a source of dissatisfaction to politically-minded Burmans and the problemsof Indian immigration, and, to a lesser extent, of Chinese immigration, wereattracting much popular attention immediately before the outbreak of hostilities in Burma. The economic position of the Indians in particular resulted in acertain amount of hostility to Indians &quot;which flared up in serious rioting in1938.SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT12. Before 1937 Burma was a province of the Indian Empire. A smallLegislative Council was set up in 1897 and enlarged in 1909 and 1920 whenit consisted of 30 members (of whom 28 were nominated and 2 were elected).In 1923 the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms of 1919 were extended to Burma.Under these a Legisative Council was set up consisting of 103 members, ofwhom 79 were elected (for the most part by popular constituencies); and executive charge of certain subjects, notably education, public health, forests,agriculture and local self-government, was transferred to two political ministers responsible to the Legislature, the remaining subjects being either reservedfor the Governor, aided by his two official Members of Council, or remainingwith the central Government of India.Separation13. The growth of political awareness in Burma was accompanied by ademand for the separation of the country from India. The Burmese differ from Indians in race, religion and culture and economically the interestsof the two countries were not the same, Burma deriving no benefit fromthe Indian protective tariffs on cloth, iron and steel, etc. Separation was recommended by the Indian Statutory Commission; and eventually, as partof the Constitutional reforms of 1935, Burma became a distinct political unitwith a constitution embodied in the Government of Burma Act, 1935, which came into force in April, 1937.
the act of 1935,4 The Act provided for the appointment of a Council of Ministers to aid and advise the Governor in all matters other than those which have to bejecided &quot; in his discretion &quot;. The chief of these reserved matters are Defence,Foreign Affairs, the control of monetary policy, relations with the smallprotected Karenni States and the administration of certain areas (the&apos;&apos; Scheduled Areas &quot; enumerated in part 1 of the Second Schedule to the\ct) in the mountainous tracts on the East, North and West of Burma properwhich are inhabited by non-Burmese peoples. To assist him in the exercise0f his discretionary functions the Governor may appoint not more than threecounsellors.15. The Governor has also &quot; special responsibilities &quot; for certain purposes and is required to act &quot; in his individual judgment &quot; when these are involved.These special responsibilities are principally for the prevention of any gravemenace to peace or tranquillity, the safeguarding of financial stability and credit of the Government of Burma, the legitimate interests of the minorities,the rights and legitimate interests of members of the Services, the preventionof discrimination against imports from the U.K. and India and against Britishsubjects belonging to the U.K. and Indians in certain matters laid down inPart V of the Act.16. The Governor is required by his Instrument of Instructions to be&quot;aided by the advice of his Ministers in matters which are outside his dis-cretionary functions and which do not involve any special responsibilities.17. The Governors Ministers are responsible to a Legislature which consists of a Senate of 36, half nominated by the Governor and half elected by theLower House, and a House of Representatives of 132 members, elected on a fairly wide franchise, the electorate including approximately every taxpayer,male and female; so that roughly 20 per cent, of the population is enfranchised,(ji of the seats are general seats, the remaining 41 being reserved for minoritiesand special interests such as the Chambers of Commerce, Labour and theUniversity.18. Section 139 of the Act enables the Governor to assume full executive and legislative powers if a situation should arise in which government cannotbe carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Act.19. Under this Constitution, which was in operation from 1937 till theJapanese invasion, Burma already enjoyed a large measure of self-governmentand Burman Ministers carried responsibilities equivalent not only to thoseof the Ministries in the autonomous Provinces in India but also, broadly speaking, equivalent to those wider functions which the Ministers in a federal government of India would have discharged under Part II of the Governmentof India Act, 1935, if it had been possible to bring the Indian Federation into being.Scheduled Areas20. The Administration of the Scheduled Areas (reserved to the Governors&quot;discretion &quot;) has been conducted on the principle of indirect rule, in theShan States through their Chiefs, and in the tribal areas through indigenousforms of government which vary locally and have been maintained in a vigorous form. Most of the Shan States were joined together for certaincommon purposes in a &quot; Federation &quot; which had its own revenues and wasself-supporting financially; the other  scheduled areas were financed from the revenues of Burma as a whole.
WORKING of THE CONSTITUTION  OF 193721. The first and only elections held under the Act of 1935 took place inNovember, 1936. There were no well-organized parties based on distinctivepolitical principles and the Burmese majority in the new legislature tended to fall into a number of smaller groupings. This lack of cohesion militatedagainst the strength and stability of the executive government. But on thewhole Burman Ministers, despite somewhat frequent changes of Cabinets andof individual Ministers, discharged their responsibilities with considerable success and without any such breakdown or interruption of constitutionalcontinuity as has occurred in India.22. There was evidence of a genuine and earnest desire to work the con-stitution and to use it to improve the condition of the people. During thefive years 1937-1942 a number of measures were passed, particularly a seriesof Agrarian Acts, and successive Ministries showed a keen interest in educa-tion, hospitals and other &quot; nation building &quot; services, while at the same timerecognizing the necessity of building up a financial reserve and the limita-tions which this imposed on the rate of progress. The country&apos;s financeswere conducted on sound lines and at the end of the five years of separationfrom India the general financial situation showed a marked improvement.23. The constitution did not of course satisfy political opinion in Burma,all political parties being united in desiring further constitutional advanceBut the demand tor full self-government was, except in the case of thenumerically small but politically important Thakin Party, usually pressedin a legitimate and constitutional manner. On several occasions during thisperiod it was stated that full self-government and the attainment of dominion status was the objective of Burma&apos;s constitutional progress. On 18th April,1943, the Secretary of State stated that it was the aim of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to assist Burma to attain complete self-government within theBritish Commonwealth as soon as circumstances permit.BURMA AND THE WAR24. On separation from India a few units were transferred to the BunroEstablishment for internal security purposes. It was recognised that defendagainst major aggression must be the responsibility of H.M.G., but on theoutbreak of war in 1939 steps were taken to effect a considerable expansiono[ the local Burma Defence Force and to enlist Burmese. A Defence council was also formed to deal with matters which affected both the reserved depart-ment of Defence and subjects for which Ministers were responsible. In 1941,in view of the threat of war with Japan, the Defence Council was reconstitutedwith extended responsibilities and on a wider basis, so as to include theGovernor, three Ministers, the three Counsellors, the G governor s financial adviser and the three Service heads. The war in Europe was too remote toevoke much interest among the masses of the people, but, with the growingmenace from Japan, the Governor, Sir R. Dorman-Smith, and his Ministerssucceeded in arousing a greater consciousness of the gravity of the situation,and when the Japanese war broke out, the great majority of the leaders ofpublic opinion were united behind the Government. There was, however,one small element which looked forward to the approach of the Japaneseas the signal for the overthrow of the British and the liberation ct Burma from foreign rule. A small number of youths belonging to the extremist element of the Thakin Party had gone to Japan and received military training there,and these entered Burma with the Japanese troops, calling themselves the
&quot; Burma Independence Army &quot;. Inside Burma they were joined by others.;onu&apos; of them genuine nationalists misled by Japanese promises, but mostlycriminally-minded elements attracted by opportunities for loot. The part played by this fifth column element was very much smaller than is sometimessupposed; in point of fact the number of Burmese actively co-operating withthe enemy at the height of the Burmese campaign was about 4,000 out of atotal population of seventeen millions. The great mass of the populationdisplayed no hostility to the Allied cause, but on the contrary there are numerous instances of loyal and resolute service to the end. Naturally inthe towns and villages of the plains the people could offer little active resist-ance to the invader. In the densely wooded hills, however, it was different;and throughout the whole of the two Burma campaigns, and the intervening period, those of the hill peoples with whom we were able to maintain contacthave shown outstanding and spontaneous. loyalty and have fought hardagainst the Japanese both as guerillas and as levies and members of theregular armed forces.BURMA UNDER JAPANESE RULE25. As the Japanese moved forward in Burma the &quot; Burma IndependenceArmy &quot; following in their wake sot up &quot; Free Burma Administrations &quot;.These, however, acted in such a violent and high-handed way that theJapanese soon suppressed them, and governed the country under a militaryrule. As from the 1st August, 1942, there also existed under the latter a.Burma Executive headed by Dr. Ba Maw (a former Premier who at the timeof the Japanese invasion was interned after serving a sentence for sedition)to deal with such subjects as the Japanese Commander-in-chief allowed.On the 1st August, 1943, the Japanese purported to grant the country in-dependence. The main features of the constitution of this &quot; independent state were the office of &quot; Adipadi &quot; or &quot; Head of the State &quot; (occupied byBa Maw), a Cabinet and a Privy Council. The Adipadi appointed ministers and Privy Councillors, the Chief Justice and other high officers, and was alsothe legislative authority.26. Reports indicate that the Japanese conducted their propaganda with considerable skill and that in the early stages of their regime a number of themore politically-minded Burmese in the towns were deluded into thinking that they had indeed come as liberators. As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that the grant of independence was illusory and that theJapanese remained the real masters, and even those who had at first welco-ncdthem became thoroughly disillusioned. Among the mass of the people, andparticularly the poorer classes, the lack of consumer goods, inflation, forced labour, corruption and lack of protection against bandits which characterisedBa Maw&apos;s regime has for long rendered it thoroughly unpopular.THE GOVERNMENT OF BURMA IN INDIA27. On the evacuation of Burma by the British forces in May, 1942, theGovernor of Burma was directed to proceed to India. Two of his Ministers,the Premier and Finance Minister, and his senior officials also went to Indiaand a large number of government servants made their way there. since it had been possible to evacuate some of its main elements, it was decided tokeep the Government of Burma in being. By courtesy of the Viceroy theyset up offices at Simla to deal with a number of administrative questionswhich required attention, such as the care of refugees, service questions, theadministration for the time being of those frontier areas of Burma which remained under British control, and making plans and preparations forichabilitation and reconstruction in Burma after its recovery.
28. Owing to the impossibility of summoning the Legislature the govern-ment could not be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Act and accordingly on the ioth December, 1942, the Governor issued a Proclarna-tion under Section 139 of the Act taking over full executive and legislative powers. The two Ministers ceased to hold office with effect from that datebut in the capacity of Burmese Advisers to the Governor continued toassist him as before.Reconstruction planning29. The Government of Burma while in India have undertaken a thorough examination of the past working of the administration of Burma and the formulation of plans for the future. These plans cover two purposes: first the immediate task of restoration after the immense material damage sufferedduring the long period for which Burma has been a scene of active operations by land and air; and secondly, taking a longer view, the improvement of all aspects of Burma&apos;s administration and economic, social and cultural develop-ment. A great deal of work has been devoted to both these aspects of re-construction, but as regards the long-term planning, it has been fully recognised that the adoption of the proposals made is contingent on two factors, namely, the approval of the Burmese people and the rehabilitation of Burma&apos;s finances. It is hoped that the very thorough plans which havebeen worked out will commend themselves to the people for whose benefitthey are intended, and that before long the means of implementing them will be available.ITie Services30.&apos; By the time the Civil Government is restored in Burma the existingestablishment of the government services will be much depleted owing to re-tirements, casualties among officers serving in the Forces and the suspension of ordinary recruitment. Consequently the Government of Burma has hadto make arrangements to fill these gaps. Since 1924 Burmanization of Class 1of the Civil Services has made rapid progress. The Class II and subordinateCivil Services are entirely non-European in composition. Recruitment isbeing reopened for the three principal administrative services, the BurmaCivil Service Class I, the Burma Police Class I and the Burma FrontierService, and also for various professional and technical posts. In the caseof the latter posts it will be necessary to recruit a certain number of Euro-peans on short engagements while Burmans are being trained to take theirplaces.Period of military administration31. On 1st January, 1944, the Supreme Allied Commander, South east asia, issued a proclamation assuming responsibility for all areas of Burmawhich were, or might be, occupied by his troops. Under his authority thusestablished the administration of the liberated areas of Burma is carried on by a Civil Affairs Service belonging to the SEA Command and recruited fromofficers of the Burma Services and others who know the country and thepeople. The period of military administration will come to an end whenoperational requirements make it possible for civil government to function.In view of the progress made with the campaign in South East Asia andthe liberation of Burma from the enemy, H.M.G. have had under considera-tion the policy to be adopted when civil government is restored and havereached the following decisions.
PART IISTATEMENT OF policy the considered policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government of promoting full self-government in Burma has frequently been declared. It is and has consist-?ntly been our aim to assist her political development till she can sustain[he responsibilities of complete self-government within the British Common-wealth and consequently attain a status equal to that of the Dominions and ofthis country.2. Inevitably Burma&apos;s progress towards full self-government has been interrupted and set back by the Japanese invasion and the long interval of enemy occupation and active warfare in her territories, during which she has suffered grave damage not only in the form of material destruction but in ashattering of the foundations of her economic and social life. It is, of course,upon these foundations that a political structure rests, and until the foundationsare once again firm the political institutions which were in operation beforethe Japanese invasion cannot be restored.For example, the removals and dispersal of the population and generalupheaval of life during enemy occupation will necessitate a complete revisionof the electoral rolls and possibly the determination of a new franchise beforesteps can be taken for a General Election; nor could an election be heldthroughout Burma until adequate restoration oif communications has been achieved. There is a most formidable task to be faced in the re-establishmentof stable conditions, the restoration of buildings, communications and public utilities and in the rehabilitation of agriculture and the other essential indus-tries which are the life-blood of the country. Till this is done, conditions arelacking in which the requirements of a democratic system of government canbe met; and these essential tasks will fall to the civil Government as soonas operational requirements permit the transfer of the administration to it from the military authorities; they will be beyond the financial resources of burma in her present ravaged condition, and His Majesty&apos;s Government willhave to come to her aid, but they will require the energetic co-operation of all sections of the Burmese people, and the more completely this can be giventhe sooner will it be possible for Burma to resume her interrupted progress inconstitutional development.3. Until these foundations are restored sufficiently to enable the first essential political process to be undertaken, that is for a Generel Election toI be held, it is not possible to re-establish a Burmese Government as it existedH in 1941. It is accordingly necessary, so long as the government of thef country cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the 1935 Act,that recourse should continue to be had to the provisions of Section 139,under which the administration is carried on by the Governor in direct responsibility to His Majesty&apos;s Government. As the proclamation, issued in1942, exhausts its validity in December next, it is proposed to make it per-missible to prolong its validity for three years more, that is till 9th December,1948. Parliament is asked to approve this extension for a period of threeyears only, in the hope that it will be possible by then, if not before, toestablish conditions in which a General Election can be held and a government established under the normal constitutional methods. If in the event this hopewas not fulfilled, it might be necessary to ask Parliament to approve a further extension. So far, however, as can be judged now, three years should suffice.But though this initial period of controlled government is necessary, HisMajesty&apos;s Government are anxions that all the functions of government shouldnot in fact be concentrated in the Governor, but that he should be provided
with definite means of obtaining Burmese assistance and advice in the dis-charge of them and have power to associate with himself representatives ofBurmese opinion in executive capacities. It is proposed, therefore, to take power to introduce by Orders in Council modifications to enable, the autocraticsystem of administration authorised by Section 139 as it now stands to beliberalised. It is contemplated that early opportunity will be taken underthese proposed powers to establish an Executive Council which, though itmight at the outset be a small and mainly official body, could be expandedas opportunity offers by the inclusion in it of non-official Burmese. Such a council would, pending the revival of normal constitutional methods, giveBurmans a share in the administrative task of restoring the economy of theircountry, subject to the retention of the Governors powers of supervision andcontrol. Such power to act by Order in Council might also be used at artappropriate stage, if recommended by the Governor and his Executive Council,to establish as an interim body a small Legislative Council. The composition and powers of these bodies and the relations between them would be pre.scribed by Orders in Council after submission to Parliament.4. The immediate purpose of such new and experimental institutions,brought in by Order in Council, would be to relax the more autocratic regimewhich Section 139 prescribes, but they would themselves necessarily lapsewhen the time comes for the operation of that Section to be terminated. Itis the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government that when conditions arc-sufficiently restored to make it possible to hold an election and terminate theoperation of Section 139, the normal provisions of the Act (unless amended by the incorporation of temporary provisions which had been found to corn-mend themselves to Burmans) will re-enter into force. A General Electioncould then be held, and a Legislature formed with the same degree of authority over the same range of matters as it enjoyed before the Japaneseinvasion.5. Government in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1935 havingthus been restored, as soon as the conditions in the country permit, a second phase in constitutional development will begin, during which the ground willbe prepared for the attainment of full self-government. At the same time thenecessary measures for the restoration of Burma&apos;s economy beyond the point which must be attained before even the first General Election can be held,would continue and her financial position would progressively develop towards a standard of self-sufficiency. Our ultimate objective during this phase will bethat representatives of the Burmese people, after reaching a sufficient measureof agreement between the various parties and sections, should draw up a constitution of a type which they themselves consider most suitable for Burma,taking into account not only the British but the other various types of consti-tution in democratically governed countries. What the machinery for thisshould be will be a matter for discussion and agreement with representativeBurmans. A simultaneous process would be discussion of the content of theagreements to be made with His Majesty&apos;s Government on matters on whichthe latter would have continuing obligations after the establishment of full self-government in Burma.6. When once the duly appointed representatives of the Burmese people have agreed, in the light of preparatory &quot;study of the subject, on the type of constitution most suitable for Burma, and it is clear that the proposedconstitution has a sufficient measure of support in Burma to justify endorse-ment by Parliament, His Majesty&apos;s Government will enter into discussions withrepresentatives of Burma with a view to satisfactory agreements being made toenable them to fulfil their continuing obligations and to safeguard any out-
standing financial advances made by His Majesty&apos;s Government, so that, whenthe necessary administrative organisation is in existence, and the other arrange-rnents have been completed, full self-government within the British Common-wealth can thereupon be established in Burma proper. The administrationof the Scheduled Areas, that is the Shan States and the tribal areas in theniountainous fringes of the country, inhabited by peoples differing in language, social customs and degree of political development from the Burmansinhabitating the central areas, would remain for the time being a responsi-bilitv of His Majesty&apos;s Government until such time as their inhabitantssignify their desire for some suitable form of amalgamation of their territorieswith Burma proper.-(42432)   229-1754   21,110   5/45   D.L.
