I also told him that we were convinced the surrender should be unconditional andsimultaneous to the three major Powers.     He expressedstrong agreement with this;      I then read him the telegramI had sent, in accordance With the Cabinet 5s decision,  to marshal Stalin and he expressed strong agreement with thisalso.      He asked me to read it out to him a second time,,which I did,  so that he could send a similar message atonce to the Russians.      I gave him the substance of thecovering note which I had prepared on our Ptaliii telegram&apos;which I attach.      An hour and a half before this talk,  Ihad sent both the Stalin message and my covering notethrough the American Embassy so he should have the writtentext of them by now.2. He also stated to me that he hoped to see mesoon,   to which I replied that we were telegraphing himproposals for a meeting,  preferably here.      1 also told him that we strongly approved of the lead he was takingon the Polish issue.      These together with complimentsformed the whole of our conversation.o oO O(intld)    W.S.C.No.  10, Downing Street25th April,   19b-5

O JANNEX special  (OPERATIONAL)PROM STOCKHOLM TO FOREIGN CFFICESir V. MalletNo^71125th April,  19U:5*MOST IMMEDIATETOP SECRETSwedish Minister for Foreign / fairs asked me and myUnited States colleague to call upon him at 23 hours 20th April.Bohemah and Count Bernaootte of Swedish.Red Cross also present.2.    Bernadotte had returned from Germany via Denmarktonight.      Himmler who was on the eastern front had asked himto come from Flensburg where he had been on Red Cross work tomeet him urgently in North Germany and Bernadotte suggestedLubeck where the meeting took place at 10 o&apos;clock this morning21-i.th April.      Himmler though tired and admitting Germany wasfinished was still calm and coherent.3.    Himmler said that Hitler was so desperately ill thathe might be dead already and in any case would be so in two days time.      General Schollenberg of Himmler&apos; s staff toldT*ernadotte that it was haemorrhage of the brain.h.    Himmler stated that while Hitler was still active hewould not have been able to take the step he&apos; now proposed, butas Hitler was finished he &quot;was now in a position of full authorityto act.      He then asked Bernado tte to forward to the swedish government his desire that they should make arrangements in orderto arrange for him to meet General Eisenhower in order to capitulateon the whole Western front.      Bernadotte remarked that such ameeting was not necessary as he could simply order his troops to surrender.      He was not willing to forward Himmler&apos;s request to the Swedish Government unless Norway and Denmark wareincluded in this capitulation.      If this were the case there might be  some point in a meeting because special technicalarrangements might have to be made regarding how and to whomthe Germans there were  to lay down their arms.      Himmler repliedthat he was prepared to order the troops in Denmark and Norwayto surrender to either British, American or Swedish troops.5*    Himmler hoped to continue resistance on the Eastern frontat least for a time which Bemadotte told him was scarcelypossible in practice and not acceptable  to the Allies.      Himmlermentioned for instance that he hoped that the Western alliesrather than the Russians would be first to enter Mecklenberg inorder to save the civilian population.6.    Schellenberg is now in Plonsburg near the Danish bordereagerly waiting to hear something and could ensure immediatedelivery to Himmler of any message which it might be desiredto convey,      Bernadotte remarked  to us  that if no reaction atall was forthcoming from the Allies,  it would probably mean alot of unnecessary suffering and loss of human life.

7-    Minister for Foreign. Affairs explained that he thought this was such an important piece of news that he ought tocommunicate it to my United St at s colleague and me immedi ate ly.My United States co lie ague and I remarked that Himmler &apos; refusal actually to order surrender on the Eastern front lookedlike a last attempt to sow discord, between the Western Alliesand Russia.      Obviously the Nazis would have to surrender toall the Allies simultaneously.      Minister for Foreign affairs and Bohernan while admitting that this motive could not be excluded pointed out that the fact that the Nazi chief wouldorder capitulation of all troops on the whole of the western front and in Norway and Denmark must be of great advantage forall the Allies including Russia end would in fact lead to earlytotal capitulation.      In    any case ,Minister for Foreign affairs thought that Bernadotte&apos;s information should be passed on to theBritish and United States Governments who were as far as theSwedish Government were concerned at complete liberty to transmitit to the Soviet Government as the Swedish Government would inno way be,  or be thought to be,   an instrument in promotingany attempt to sow discord between the Allies.      The only reason why the Swedish Government could not inform the Soviet Governmentdirectly was because Ilimmler had stipulated that this informant ionwas exclusively for the &quot;Western Allies08.    My United States colleague is sending a similar telegram to his Government.

PRIME MINISTER TO PRESIDENT TRUMAN.PERSONAL AND TOP SECRETYou will no doubt have received some hoursago the report from Stockholm by your Ambassador on theBernadotte-Himmler talks.      I called the War Cabinettogether at once and they approved the immediately -following telegram which we are sending to Marshal Stalinand repeating through the usual channels to you.     we hope you will find it possible to telegraph to marshal Stalin and to us in the same sense *      As Himmleris evidently speaking for the German State,  as much asanybody can, the reply that should be sent him throughthe Swedish Government Is in principle a matter for thetriple Powers,  since no one of us con enter into separatenegotiations.      This feet however in no way abrogatesGeneral Eisenhower&apos;s or Field Marshal Alexander&apos;s authorityto accept local surrenders as they occur.

PRIME MINISTER TO MARSHAL STALINPERSONAL AND TOP secret the telegram in my immediately following telegramhee just reached me from the British Ambassador in Sweden.The President of the United States has the news also.There can be no question as far as -His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis concerned of anything less than unconditional.surrendersimultaneously to the three major Powers.      We considerHimmler should be told that German forces,  either as individuals or in units,  should everywhere surrenderthemselves to the Allied troops or representatives on the spot.      Until thus happens the attack of the Allies upon them on all sides and in all theatres where resistancecontinues will be prosecuted with the utmost vigour.Nothing in the above telegram should affectthe release of our orations on the link-up.-\- Stockholm telegram No.  711 of 25th April.
