THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY.OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET. Copy No.      3 jW.P. (45) 257. V17*A April, 1945.WAR CABINET.RELEASE OF MINERS FROM THE ARMED FORCES.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1. At their meeting on the 12th April (W.M. (45) 42nd Conclusions,Minute 3) the War Cabinet agreed that officials of the Departments concerned should prepare a report on the possibility of arranging, within the principlesof the existing scheme of demobilisation, for the return to the mines, as soon aspossible after the end of the German war, of the largest possible number of experienced miners still in the Forces, and that this report should be consideredby a Committee consisting of the Minister of Labour and National Service (inthe Chair), the Secretary of State for War, the Minister of Supply, the Ministerof War Transport and the Minister of Fuel and Power, who should submit their recommendations to the War Cabinet in time for them to be considered beforethe end of the week beginning the 16th April.2. After considering the report by the officials, we have agreed on therecommendations set out in paragraphs 7 to 9. One of the possibilities dealtwith in the report by the officials would have affected releases of building workers,and we therefore felt it right to bring the Minister of Works into our discussion.3. Since 31,500 of the 37,000 underground coal miners in the Forces are inthe Army, our recommendations apply primarily to the position in the Army,but they should be applicable with slight modifications to the Royal Air Force.The number of underground coal miners in the Navy is negligible.4. The demand of the Minister of Fuel and Power is for 20,000 face-workers, the releases to begin not later than mid-August, and to be completed not later than mid-October. In so far as face-workers cannot be provided, otherunderground workers should be released to make up the total of 20,000.5. It is estimated that if hostilities in Europe end on the 31st May, 1945,the Army will begin to release men in Class A in mid-July at the rate of 25,000every two weeks, with the result that 150,000 will have been released by mid-October. In addition Class B releases, which cannot begin until a month afterthe start of Class A releases, will amount to a maximum of 15,000 up to mid-October. Of the 150,000 Class A releases 4,500 will be underground coalminers,4,000 being face-workers. None of the Class B releases will be coalminers, sinceClass B is confined to building workers and certain specialists on an individualbasis.On present plans, therefore, 4,500 underground miners will be releasedagainst the demand of the Ministry of Fuel and Power for 20,000, leaving a deficit of 15,500 underground miners.6. We were clear from the outset that any plan to meet the deficit byreleasing miners out of their turn in Class A must be rejected as being incon-sistent with the principles of the demobilisation scheme; and we accordinglyexamined the possibility of releasing the 15,500 miners required in Class B. This,however, could be done only :-(i) by increasing temporarily the proportion of Class B to Class A from10 per cent, to 20 per cent. The effect of this would be to delay allClass A releases after mid-August for a fortnight; or(ii) by confining to coalminers all Class B releases up to the end of October.[29736]
we have felt bound to reject both these alternatives. As regards (i), webelieve that any delays in releasing men in Class A or any proposal to increaseClass B beyond 10 per cent, of Class A would arouse strong- resentment in theForces. On the other hand, the adoption of (ii) would mean that up to the endof October there would be no Class B releases tor building or any of the other purposes (e.g., teaching and individual key jobs) at present covered by Class B.7. We have therefore been driven to the conclusion that the only methodby which an increase can be obtained in the number of miners released from theForces in the period up to mid-October is by accelerating the releases in Class Ain this period. Whether this will be possible depends on the extent to which theenemy&apos;s resistance in Europe is prolonged, and we do not think that it would be fair in our present state of knowledge to press the Secretary of State for War toagree to any specific target. If, however,- conditions turn out to be favourable,it might be possible to increase the number of Class A releases up to mid-Octoberfrom 150,000 to 200,000. The effect of this would be to increase the number ofunderground coalminers released in Class A from 4,500 to 6.000. Moreover, anincrease from 150,000 to 200,000 in the releases in Class A would permit us toincrease the Class B releases by 5,000 without infringing the understanding thatClass B should not exceed 10 per cent, of Class A, and we suggest that under-ground coaiminers might form half of this increase and that the remainder should consist of building workers. This would mean that 8.500 underground coal-miners would be supplied from the Army. We suggest that the same principles should be followed in relation to releases from the E.A.F., although we realise that the additional number of coalminers made available would be small.The coal industry can expect to obtain a further addition to its labourstrength from releases of miners from industry over the same period. It is notpossible to make an estimate of the numbers that are likely to be obtained from this source, but, given favourable war conditions, the industry might expect to obtain a total of at least 10.000 underground coalminers from the Forces and from industry .against an estimated need of 20,000. We recognise that, even if thesefigures are achieved and the course of the war may well preclude this the coal situation next winter will be difficult, but we do not see what more can be donewuthout imperilling the whole demobilisation scheme.8. Our proposals will have the effect of increasing the number of building trade workers released from the Forces. The acceleration of Class A releasesshould make available an additional 4,500 building trade workers, while a further2,500 would be obtained from Class B a total additional increase of 7,000.9.   To sum up, we recommend (a) that the Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for air should be asked to take all possible steps to accelerate Class A releases in the first three months of releases; and(b) that, in so far as it is possible to increase releases in Class A, there shouldbe a proportionate increase in Class B releases, half of this increase to consist of underground coalminers and the remainder of building workers.(Initialled) E.
