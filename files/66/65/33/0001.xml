naval SITUATION.Genera! Review.1.   An amphibious operation has been carried out by the East Indies fleet in support of the attack on Rangoon by the Fourteenth Army. ......    - ,:One U-boat has been sunk, two probably sunk, and four possibly sunk.      ...Northern Waters.2. H.M.S. Goodall (frigate) was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat off KolaInlet on the 30th : 2 officers and 29 ratings were rescued.H.M. M/S trawler Ebor Wyke was sunk off Reykjavik on the 2nd, probably by U-boat : there was one survivor.Home Waters.3. M.T.B&apos;s. on the night of the 25th/26th torpedoed and sank an armedcoaster off the Dutch coast.The surrender of Bremen from&quot; the acting burgomaster on the 26th was accepted by officers of a naval unit which reached the city hall ahead of thetroops. There is apparently no great damage to docks, quays, walls, cranesor railway lines in the harbour area, but the warehouses are totally destroyed. Afew wrecks obstruct the harbour, and prisoners state that many mines have beensown in all enclosed basins.H.M.S. Redmill (frigate) was torpedoed on the 27th off the west coast ofIreland (R) whilst on anti-submarine patrol, and reached port in tow : 22 ofthe ship&apos;s company are missing.On the 29th H.M.S. Sheldrake sank a midget U-boat off Lowestoft.British and Allied ships on the 30th bombarded in support of the assault onthe lie d&apos;01eron (at the mouth of the Gironde) against light opposition.4. During the eight days ending the 30th the combined British and U.S.discharges through the liberated ports were approximately 78,000 men, 6,770vehicles, 506,150 tons of stores, 32,600 tons of coal, 192,250 tons of petrol, and50,625 tons of ammunition.Mediterranean.5. Although the entrance to the harbour at Spezia is blocked, the damage to the docks and harbour facilities is not so great as had been expected. At Genoamany quays are intact, cranes and gantries are standing, and public services arenormal.   Bad weather has prevented minesweeping in the approaches.A small British minesweeper was mined in the northern Adriatic on the 29thand later sank in tow.The surrender terms signed by the German C.-in-C., S.W. area, includes all german and Italian ships and vessels in Italy, the Gulf of Trieste being excluded.*Bast Indies.6. An amphibious assault was carried out on the 2nd by the East IndiesFleet at the mouth of the Rangoon River. The force was composed of 3 H.Q.landing ships, 4 infantry landing ships and 1 repair landing ship, 45 majorlanding craft, 110 minor landing craft, and 1 depot ship; and was supported bya carrier group consisting of H.M. ships Royalist and Phwbe (cruisers), Hunter,Stalker, Emperor and Khedive (assault carriers), screened by H.M. shipsSaumarez, Venus, Virago and Vigilant (destroyers), 2 R.I.N. sloops and&apos; frigates. Ahead of this force were 30 minesweepers, and there were also 3 M.L.flotillas, 1 repair ship, 1 fleet tender and a survey group (including a weatherreporting ship). The fleet train, consisting of 3 fleet oilers, 8 small tankers, and5 storeships, replenished the force.On patrol in preparation for this operation ELM. ships Roebuck, Racehorseand Redoubt on the 30th destroyed a convoy of 10 small ships bound fromRangoon to Moulmein. At dawn the same morning a force consisting of H.M.S.Queen Elizabeth, the French battleship Richelieu, H.M. ships Cumberland,
Suffolk and Ceylon (cruisers), the Dutch cruiser Tromp, H.M. ships Empress andShah (carriers), with three destroyers, bombarded airstrips on Car Nicobar.During the afternoon this force shelled Port Blair in the Andamans, and at dawnon 1st May the destroyer force (Roebuck, &amp;c.) shelled Car Nicobar.Pacific.7. During their first period of operations in the Pacific the British PacificFleet was replenished at sea seven times by ships of the fleet train. The fleet was at sea for 31 days.On the 27th, 28th and 29th, Allied cruisers and destroyers bombardedTarakan Island, off the east coast of Dutch Borneo, without opposition.On the night of the 27th/28th an enemy aircraft bombed the harbour atManus Island (Admiralty Islands) causing slight damage.British carrier-borne aircraft on the 21st and 22nd attacked the Ryukyus :among the targets were the airfields whence enemy aircraft operated against theAllied fleets.Anti-Submarine Operations.8. During the week 42 attacks on U-boats were reported, of which 23 wereby shore-based aircraft and 19 by warships.On the 24th a U.S. escort group sank a U-boat in mid-Atlantic and took 33prisoners. On the 26th two Norwegian M.T.Bs. probably sank a U-boat offStavanger after a gun engagement. The 19th Escort Group on the 29th, offKola Inlet, probably sank a U-boat by gunfire and possibly a second. Liberatorsof Coastal Command, on the 23rd, possibly sank a U-boat off the Orkneys, and onthe 25th one off Ushant, where on the 30th one was possibly sunk by a U.S.Catalina.A daily average of 14 escort groups, consisting of 66 destroyers, frigates,sloops and corvettes, were employed on anti-submarine operations in coastal waters, and augmented the escorts of coastal and ocean convoys.During April seven U-boats were sunk, 13 probably sunk, and 15 possiblysunk.Enemy Intelligence.German.9. Reconnaissance of Kiel on the 2nd showed the Hipper in dock. Salvageoperations have been in progress on the ICdln at Wilhelmshaven.U-Boats.10. Although no attacks have been made on cargo ships, U-boats have operated in the convoy approach routes north and south of Ireland (R).At Bremen some 16 U-boats on the slips or partially completed were captured.Japanese.11.   The Japanese aircraft carrier strength is as follows :  Fleet carriers : 2 operational, 1 damaged, 1 completed but not worked up,2 fitting out. Light fleet carriers : 1 presumed operational, but possibly damaged.Training carrier : 1, probably exercising. Escort carriers : 2 operational, 5 fittingout, 1 under conversion from a tanker.Enemy Attack on Shipping.12. During the week two ships were mined in the Mediterranean. One ofthem, the s.s, Neuralia (9,182 tons, built in 1912), was sunk in the Gulf ofTaranto : she had no troops on board. The other was mined in the Gulf ofSalonika and later reached port.Provisional shipping losses by enemy action and marine causes during Aprilwere 25 ships of 124,357 tons.Allied Minelaying.13. H.M. ships have laid a large number of mines during the week in home waters. .Aircraft laid mines off the coasts of Siam and Malaya.[29821] b
Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.14.   No enemy minelaying has been reported.Sweeping has been carried out off the East Coast, in the Scheldt approachchannels, and in the approaches to Bordeaux.In the Mediterranean 16 mines have been destroyed in the northern Adriaticand 10 in the iEgean.The mine totals are 6,553 ground and 9,787 moored.  - .Enemy Merchant Shipping.15. Photographic reconnaissance of the Elbe on the 24th showed two350-ft. cargo ships sunk in mid-channel in the narrow part of the river belowHamburg.16. The German s.s. Haussa (5,000 tons) is reported to have arrived atYstad, Sweden, from Swinemunde, and to have been interned.17. Owing to the coal shortage in Norway some coastal steamers are usingwood fuel, whilst many services have been cut. There is a shortage of bunkercoal at all ports.18. In Denmark the total stocks of coal were estimated early in April at280,000 tons, and the total monthly consumption 105,000 tons.Two Danish ships of 1,500 tons each were sunk by sabotage at Copenhagenon the 12th.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.- (An outline map showing European Fronts is included as an inset.)General.19. Activity during the week has been largely confined to the southern andnorthern flanks. On the former, the Swiss frontier has been closed from Basle toFriedrichshafen, Munich has been captured and the Austrian frontier crossedin four sectors, namely S.E. of Lake Constance, S.E. of Kempten, north ofInnsbruck and in the Passau area.In the Centre, the Czechoslovak -frontier has been crossed west of Pilsenand junctions with the Russians have been effected in.the Leipzig-Dessau area.The main events of importance on the northern front have been the crossingof the Elbe S.E. of Hamburg, and the capture of Bremen by the Second british army.In the Bay of Biscay the He d&apos;01eron has been captured.Southern Sector.20. Opposition on this sector has been spasmodic and the powerful offensiveby the First French and Seventh U.S. Armies to clear the Black Forest and southern Bavaria has continued uniformly successful. On the right french troops reached the Swiss frontier at Basle on the 26th, and by the 29th hadcleared the whole of this border as far as Friedrichshaf en. By the 1st of May,they had penetrated some 5 miles into Austria. On their left, the Seventh U.S.Army also crossed the Austrian frontier S.E. of Kempten on the 28th, and bythe 1st had. driven to within 5 miles of Imst. Further east, another U.S. columntook Schongau on the 28th, and reached the frontier near Garmisch-Parten-kirchen two days later. This thrust was, by the 2nd; within 10 miles ofInnsbruck.Meanwhile other troops of the Seventh U.S. Army, having taken Augsburg,closed to the outskirts of Munich on the 30th. There was some resistance in thecity, which was reported almost clear on the 1st. At the same time forces whichhad passed through Munich were by the 2nd within 35 miles of Salzburg.Central Sector.21. The Third U.S. Army has continued its powerful thrust down the danube. On its right, this Army crossed the river in the Ingolstadt and Regens-burg areas on the 26th/27th and pressing forward against scattered oppositioncrossed the River Isar and captured Land shut on the 30th. On its left, armourreached the Austrian frontier 35 miles N.W. of Linz and was, on the 2nd, reported
15 miles from the town. Passau fell on the 1st. Other troops have made pene-trations into Czechoslovakia on a wide front.On the First U.S. Army front interest has been chiefly centred on the junctionwith the Russians, with whom first contact was made on the 25th in the vicinity of Torgau.  Since then other contacts have been made at Pretzsch and Wittenberg.Northern Sector.22. Troops of the Second British Army had by the 27th reached the lineof the Elbe and had cleared the greater part of Bremen. Since then Britisharmour has thrust steadily into the Cuxhaven Peninsula reaching the Stade-Bremervorde area by the 1st. At 0200 hours on the 30th, an attack was launchedacross the Elbe in the Lauenburg area. A bridgehead was soon established and tanks were passed across. On the same day a further bridgehead was establishedby U.S. troops under British command 10 miles S.E. of Lauenburg. These twobridgeheads were quickly linked up, and by the 2nd Schwerin had been taken and the Baltic reached at Wismar and Lubeck against slight opposition.Italy.   (An outline map showing European Fronts is included as an inset.)General.23. The German Army, under the command of Colonel-General Vietinghoff,surrendered on the 2nd May.During the week leading up to this surrender the Allied Armies continued their advances into Northern Italy with giant strides. In the N.E. area, wherecontact was made with Marshal Tito&apos;s forces on the 1st. the battle continuesagainst the German forces who do not come under General Vietinghoff&apos;s command.Eighth Army.24. The Eighth Army, having advanced to the Po on the 25th, crossed overto capture Adria and Rovigo on the following day. By the 28th, with the RiverAdige behind them, British armour and Dominion troops had cut the Padua-Legnago road at three points, including the capture of Monselice, a communicationcentre. The next day Padua fell to Dominion troops, who pressed on N.E. throughVenice and.crossed their next major river obstacle, the Piave, without pause onthe 30th. Leading troops linked up with Jugoslav elements near the River Isonzothe following day, and have since advanced into Trieste. Meanwhile Britisharmour continued to make comparable progress on the left of the Dominion troops,capturing Udine on the 2nd May, and pressing on to the north.Fifth Army.25. The Fifth Army, having crossed the Po in strength on the 25th, seizedVerona on the following day, while a thrust to the N.W. secured Parma. Bythe 28th, Castelfranco, Vicenza and Como had fallen and the escape routes ofthe German Fourteenth Army, already severed from the Tenth Army to theEast, were cut. The U.S. forces then carried out extensive mopping up opera-tions against these German divisions, which by now were completely encircledbetween the U.S. troops, the Swiss border, French troops under SFfAEF controland the Ligurian Sea. Along this coast U.S. coloured troops had alreadyadvanced from Spezia to capture Genoa on the 27th. Two columns then droveon S.W. through Savona, and N.W. to Turin, which fell on the 30th.Russian Front.(An outline map showing European Fronts is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.26. Since the capture of Pillau the Russians have made some progress along the Frisches Nehrung.Central Sector.27. In their attack from the Stettin area, the Russians have pushed onrapidly, having captured Prenzlau on the 27th, and entered the province ofMecklenburg, capturing Neubrandenburg on the 30th. Griefswald andNeustrelitz were also taken on the 30th, and a link-up effected with a northwardadvance from the area north of Berlin. On the following day Stralsund was captured.   Latest news is of the capture of Rostock.The Battle for Berlin continued during the week with fierce fightino-.Potsdam and the Tempelhof airport were taken on the 27th, and the battle for[29821] B 2
the inner city commenced on the following day. The city finally fell on the2nd May, the Russians taking 70,000 prisoners. In an advance west of the city,Rathenow was captured on the 27th, and.troops on the Elbe were reported by theGermans to have turned their backs on the Americans in an attempt to relieveBerlin from the outside.   Brandenburg was taken on the 1st.After some German break-out attempts from the pocket S.E. of Berlin, the pocket was finally liquidated on the 2nd. The Russians claim 120,000 prisoners in the fighting in this area.Southern Sector.28. Some progress has been made this week in the Morava valley and eastand S.E. of Brno. The main fighting has been in the area of Moravska Ostrava,which was captured on the 30th. On the same day Zilina in the Carpathians wastaken and the Russians have since made a considerable advance north and southof this area and further to the S.W.Burma.29. On the western bank of the Irrawaddy our troops have occupied Salinand Minbu. Leading elements have reached a point 23 miles west of Minhla,where they are in light contact. On the eastern bank of the river, a column ofour troops captured Allanmyo on the 29th. This column has now reached a pointonly 12 miles north of Prome. Another column is clearing the pocket betweenAllanmyo and Magwe.Progress on the main Meiktila-Rangoon axis has been rapid. Nyaunglebinwas leached by armoured columns on the 29th. Resistance was offered atPayagale, but this was overcome on the 30th. Pegu fell on the 2nd May aftercolumns had captured Waw and Thanatpin to the east. In the Waw area, our forces liberated a column of Allied prisoners of war.On.the 1st, our parachute troops were dropped in the area 2 miles west ofElephant Point at the mouth of the Rangoon river. Early on the 2nd, seabornelandings were made in the Rangoon estuary in the area of Sadainghmut and onthe Chaung 1^ miles S.W. of Kyauktan. No opposition has been encounteredso far. Rangoon is thus menaced both from the N.E. and the south. elements of the Japanese garrison are reported to be withdrawing eastwards.Pacific.Philippines.30. In Northern Luzon, U.S. forces captured Baguio, the summer capital,on the 29th, in face of fierce Japanese resistance.U.S. troops have also made considerable progress in Southern Luzon. Forcesadvancing from the west have reached Daet, and are now within 35 miles of theforce advancing eastward from Legaspi.On the 26th, U.S. forces carried out a further landing at Dumaguete on theS.E. coast of Negros.
