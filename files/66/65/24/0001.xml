(45) 274.27th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.INDIA: THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION.Report by the India Committee.I.-The Background of the Viceroy&apos;s Visit.THE War Cabinet at their meeting on the 18th December, 1944 (W.M. (44)171st Conclusions, Minute 6), invited the India Committee to proceed withexamination of the Indian problem consequent on certain exchanges of correspondence with the Viceroy. In March 1945, on the urgent representationof the Viceroy that he should return to this country without further delay for consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government on the constitutional proposals whichhe wished to put forward, the War Cabinet agreed that he should do so, and invited the India Committee to report to them on Lord wavell&apos;s proposals after discussion with him. It is important to emphasise that this is the actual situation with which we have had to deal, for the decision to be reached is undoubtedlyaffected by the fact that the Viceroy is known to have returned to this countryfor the purpose of consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government on this sort of question.2. We need not trouble the War Cabinet with the detail of the Viceroy&apos;sproposals. Very briefly their effect is that he should be authorised by HisMajesty&apos;s Government to enter into negotiation with Indian political leaders fora constitutional advance which would be represented by the substitution for theexisting members of the Governor-General&apos;s Executive Council (other than theCommander-in-Chief and the Viceroy himself) of Indians chosen from lists putforward by the leaders of certain political parties consequent on a conference with the Viceroy. There would be no formal change in the constitution savethat legislation would be necessary wholly to eliminate the official element in theExecutive Council for which the present Act makes provision. The Viceroygreatly desired a free hand in the matter, and thought that if he was permitted to approach the leaders of the main political organisations in India, and inparticular the leaders of Congress and of the Muslim League, he would be ableto produce a new Executive, composed of these representative persons, in placeof his present Council.3. The Committee have had many meetings, including several at which theViceroy has attended. In the result they have reached the conclusion that theViceroy cannot prudently be given the free hand which he desires. It seems to us that if authority is to be given for seeking to make at this time an importantchange in the composition of the Viceroy&apos;s Council, it must be done with a clear and definite recognition of the extent to which Indian administration andthe Viceroy&apos;s responsibilities will be affected. To entrust to the Viceroy sowide an area of negotiation is, in our judgment, likely to put him in a verydifficult position, since different party leaders would seek to make terms forII. The Viceroy&apos;s Proposals.[29796]b
securing their own particular objectives, e.g., Pakistan on the one hand, andHindu supremacy on the other. If, therefore, a change is now to be sought,it ought to be within a framework which is definitely laid down by the WarCabinet itself, and made public in a formal announcement by the Secretary ofState for India in Parliament. Indeed, it would be manifestly impossible forthe Viceroy to return to India with authority to make enquiries and proposalswithout publishing what they were, for there would inevitably be an immediateleakage, and Parliament would certainly require full information as to theposition.III. Should any new departure be attempted?4. There is, however, one preliminary matter on which the Committee isnot able to offer a unanimous view, and which must be submitted to, and decided by, the War Cabinet itself. This is the question whether any new departureshould now be attempted at all. If it is decided by the War Cabinet that weare inevitably driven to make a new approach the Committee is able to give more precise advice as to the nature of the action that should be taken.5. It is necessary to set out briefly the arguments on either side on thispreliminary point :Arguments for a ?iew step.(a) The Viceroy&quot;s view, strongly expressed to the Committee, is that while he can hold the situation for the time being, it may easily be serious once hostilitiesare over, and that unless action is taken now irretrievable damage may be done to British-Indian relations. After the Avar there will be a most difficult period,of transition from war to peace conditions. The under-manned and over-worked, administrative clock is running down, and it is essential, from the point of viewboth of the political situation and of the administrative machine, to make some^advance at this present stage&apos;which would find a constructive outlet for theenergies of educated Indians. Much importance, he contends, must attach to the considered view of the man on the spot.(b) While the offer made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1942 did not produce a constitutional solution, and left the Indians to devise a new constitu-,tion for themselves, it is manifest that they cannot, in present circumstances,achieve this, and, illogical though it may be, they look to the British Governmentto help them out of the deadlock which has arisen. For His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to take up the attitude that the deadlock is none of their making, and is dueto Indian conditions, and that the problem is one that can only be solved by indians themselves, will not satisfy those who believe that India should achieveself-government. Even if proposals now put forward by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment fail to achieve an agreed change, the fact that they have been put forwardought to remove the reproach so widely levied against us that we are lying back and counting upon the Indians&apos; inability to agree.(c) Great expectations have been aroused by the fact that the Viceroy,albeit at his own request, has come over to. consult His Majesty&apos;s Government.How is it possible that he should go back empty-handed ?(d) The expectation that His Majesty&apos;s Government will authorise a newstep is not limited to India. There has been speculation in the Press in thiscountry; there are signs of Parliamentary interest; and, finally, American opinionwill be strongly moved if it could be said that those who wish to see India furtheradvanced towards self-government have received a blank negative in London.A rguments against a new step.(a) There is some difference of opinion among us as to whether the case forany further step has been proved, or whether if there is such a case, it is socogent as the Viceroy suggests.(&amp;) May not the effect of a new step be prejudicially to affect the Viceroy&apos;position and to lead to his authority and powers being whittled away without afull realisation of what is happening until it is too late to check the process ? is there a risk of communal rivalry being aggravated rather than soothed ? Will thepresent proposal tend to prejudice, rather than to promote, the chances ofworking towards a proper comprehensive attempt at a constitutional settlementhereafter %(c) It is impossible to feel confident that the proposals in view, howevergenerous they may be, will in fact meet with the acceptance of Indian public and political opinion, especially of the Muslims, the Hindu Mahasabba, and some
other sections.   If they do not, we shall have conceded important points inprinciple without having anything to show in return.(d) The disturbing effect on our friends and supporters in India, and on the element in that country which prizes the British connection, of what will be interpreted as a yielding by His Majesty&apos;s Government to political pressureand to Congress must not be overlooked. This will be very marked in the case ofthose members of the present Executive Council who may not be appointed to thenew Council, and who will feel that after loyal and distinguished service in a difficult time, they have been thrown over cavalierly.(e) Even supposing that the promulgation of the plan was welcomed by the leaders such as Gandhi and Jinnah, is there any real prospect that theGovernor-General&apos;s Council, when composed of the leading personalities of the organised Indian political parties, will co-operate loyally and heartily in carryingon the war against Japan ?(/) Even if the Congress accept the new proposals, is there not a danger thatthey will very shortly feel themselves strong enough to produce a crisis unfavour-able to the British, with the result that the balanced representation, for which theViceroy hopes, would be destroyed?6. The members of the India Committee are not able to reach a united view as to which set of arguments should prevail, and they have summarised these considerations on either side in order that the War Cabinet may have the main considerations fairly and fully before them.IY. If a new step is to be taken, what should its nature be?7. Provided that the War Cabinet decides in all the circumstances that further action must be taken, the Committee is agreed as to the kind of actionwhich would seem most appropriate. This action does not follow the linesoriginally put forward by the Viceroy, and in certain respects it goes further than he had proposed. But it ensures that the enquiries he will make when he returnsto India, and the interviews which he holds, will be within the framework of proposals which His Majesty&apos;s Government would announce before the interviewsbegin, and which the Secretary of State would expound to Parliament as beingthe changes which we should be prepared to see if the leaders of the main political parties in India agree to accept them and loyally to operate them.8. The War Cabinet will find it a convenient course to gather what theseproposals are from the draft statement in the Appendix to this Report, whichit is proposed (if the proposals are made) that the Secretary of State should makein the House of Commons at the appropriate moment.9. Without going through the paragraphs of this draft statement in detail,it seems necessary to point out the main difference between what the committee epropose and what the Viceroy at first advocated. The main diffe rence is thatthe Committee&apos;s proposal would openly avow that the scheme is one which if accepted will give increasing authority to the representatives of the indian political parties sitting in the Viceroy&apos;s Council, and that some progressivediminution of the Viceroy&apos;s authority might be expected; whereas the Viceroy&apos;splan set no precise boundaries to the area of negotiations, the proposed statement would define these boundaries strictly. Moreover, it is the essence of the proposed statement that it is made public for all to recognise its nature and to appreciate the importance of the changes involved, whereas the Viceroy appeared to us to wish to conduct a negotiation Avhich might not bring out publicly the extentof the changes involved.10. We would add that while we are by no means certain that the indian political leaders would accept even the sdheme embodied in the draft statementprepared by the Committee/Ave feel that the effect of the rejection by them of a plan, generously conceived, and precisely stated, of this nature would place them at a grave disadvantage before public opinion in this country, in India and in theworld. That would not necessarily be the case, in our judgment, in respect ofthe somewhat vaguely stated and limited proposals put forward by the Viceroy.V. Supplementary matters to be considered in connection with any new stepif made.11. There are certain supplementary matters of very considerable importance^ which should be considered in connection with the changes suggestedif it is decided to promote this advance.[29796] B 2
(a) Indianisation of the Army.. The Secretary of State for War informs us that the Secretary of Statefor India has consulted him on proposals by the Commander-in-Chief in Tndiafor the future officering of the Indian Armed Services. The effect is that if HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India approve, there should be nofurther recruitment of British officers into the Indian Army. This means that within a certain period of years the Indian Army will be entirely Indianised.But until the Indian Army can be manned wholly by Indians, even in the highestranks, the required number of European officers for the three Services will befound by secondment from the corresponding British Services, subject to specialtemporary arrangements in the case of the Royal Indian Navy.If this recommendation is accepted and, in view of the pledges that havebeen given, and of the behaviour of the Indian Army during the war, we agreewith the Secretary of State for War that it is inevitable and inescapable thatit should be we think it essential to announce it at the same time as any state-ment is made in the constitutional field. The announcement, which would, in our judgement, be an impressive pledge of the good faith of this country, and of great political importance, could best be made in the Secretary of State&apos;s speech inthe House of Commons on explaining the statement.(b) External Affairs.We are satisfied that there is a case on merits, quite independent of anygeneral political move, for the transfer of the portfolio of External Affairs toan Indian Member of Council. This would be accompanied by the appointmentof fully accredited representatives for the representation of India abroad. Anannouncement to this effect would further enhance the value of any statementnow to be made, and we have, for that reason, included provision for it inparagraphs 19 and 20 of the draft appended to our report.Following on such a decision it should be made clear in the Secretary ofState&apos;s statement in Parliament, as also by the Viceroy in any statement whichhe makes in India, that the delegates of British India at the Peace conference or at other future international conferences will be chosen by the new Governmentof India.(c) Appointment of a United Kingdom High Commissioner in India.We think that, on merits, it is important that the particular interests of theUnited Kingdom in India should, in future, be represented by a High Com-missioner. Such an appointment will, in any event, enhance India&apos;s status and make it clear that the Governor-General&apos;s authority in his responsibility to theSecretary of State is concerned primarily with the interests of the security and welfare of India itself, with the obligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government ito theStates, and with the general interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. Anannouncement to this effect would increase the value of any statement and itcould best be made by the Secretary of State in his speech explaining any state-men t to the House.(d) Release of certain political detainees.The House of Commons will obviously wish to know what is to be done withregard to the Congress political detainees. We recommend that the Secretaryof State should make it clear in his statement that, in the event of the successof the negotiations, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to recommend the Central and Provincial authorities in India now in charge of these detaineesto consider favourably the release of those detained as the result of the Congressresolution of August 1942. The reason for this recommendation is that in orderto carry through the negotiations, it is certain that some political prisoners whoare now interned would have to be released, and we find it difficult to think thatothers in the same category can be indefinitely detained.tVI. Attitude of the Viceroy towards the draft statement prepared by theCommittee.12. We think it desirable in conclusion to record that there have beendiscussions between the Secretary of State and the Viceroy, and that we under-stand that in the light of them the Viceroy would be willing to treat his mandateas represented by the draft statement appended to this Report. &apos;
YII. Conclusion.13. To sum up. We are unable to reach a united view as to whether a freshstep should now be taken. We feel that the decision on this must be for theWar Cabinet in the light of the arguments which we have marshalled above. Weare clear that the proposals in the form brought home by the Viceroy areinacceptable. If the War Cabinet decide in favour of a new step then werecommend that it be on the lines of the statement in the Appendix, and inparagraph 11 of this report.SIMON,Acting Chairman(on behalf of the Committee).27th April, 1Mb.
APPENDIX.Draft Statement.I. During the recent visit of Pield-Marshal Viscount Wavell to thiscountry His Majesty&apos;s Government reviewed with him a number of problems and discussed particularly the present political situation in India.2. Members will be aware that since the offer by Plis Majesty&apos;s Governmentto India in March 1942 there has been no further progress towards the solutionof the Indian constitutional problem.3. As was then stated, the working out of India&apos;s new constitutional system is a task which can only be carried through by the Indian peoples themselves.4. While His Majesty&apos;s Government are at all times most anxious to do their utmost to assist the Indians in the working out of a new constitutional settlement, it would be a contradiction in terms to speak of the imposition bythis country of self-governing institutions upon an unwilling India. Such athing is not possible, nor could we accept the responsibility for enforcing suchinstitutions at the very time when we were, by its purpose, withdrawing fromall control of British Indian affairs.5. The main constitutional position remains therefore as it was. The offer of March 1942 stands in its entirety without change or qualification. HisMajesty&apos;s Government still hope that the political leaders in India may be ableto come to an agreement as to the procedure whereby India&apos;s permanent futureform cf government can be determined.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government are, however, aware that a continuation ofthe present situation is harmful, and are most anxious to make any contributionthat is practicable to the breaking of the political deadlock in India. Whilethat deadlock lasts not only political but social and economic progress is beinghampered.7. The Indian administration, over-burdened with the great tasks laid upon it by the war against Japan and by the planning for the post-war period,is further strained by the political tension that exists.8. All that is so urgently required to be done for agricultural and industrialdevelopment and for the peasants and workers of India cannot be carried throughunless the whole-hearted co-operation of every community and section of theIndian people is forthcoming.9. His Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore considered whether there isnot something which they could suggest in this interim period, pending the formulation by Indians of their future constitutional arrangements, which wouldenable the main communities and parties to,co-operate closely together and withthe British to the great benefit of the people of India as a whole.10. It is not the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to introduce anychange contrary to the wishes of the major Indian communities. But they are willing to make possible some step forward during the interim period if theleaders of the principal Indian parties are prepared to agree to their suggestions and to co-operate in the successful conclusion of the war against Japan as well asin the reconstruction in India which must follow the final victory.II. To this end they would be prepared to see an important change in theconstitution of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive. This is possible without making anychange in the existing statute law except for one amendment to the Ninth Scheduleto the Act of 1935. That Schedule contains a provision that not less than three members of the Executive must have had at least 10 years&apos; service under the Crownin India. If the proposals I am about to lay before the House meet withacceptance in India, that clause would have to be amended to dispense with thatrequirement.12. It is proposed that the Executive Council should be reconstituted andthat the Viceroy should in future make his selection for nomination to the Crownfor appointment to his Executive from amongst leaders of Indian political life atthe Centre and in the Provinces, in proportions which would give a balancedrepresentation of the main communities, including equal proportions of Moslemsand Caste Hindus.
13. The members of the Executive would be Indians with the exception ofthe Viceroy and the Commander-in-Chief, who would retain his position as WarMember. This is essential so long as the defence of India remains a british responsibility.14. Although these proposals do not entail any major legislative change,His Majesty&apos;s Government fully realise, and desire to emphasise, the fact thatthey have considerable constitutional implications.15. The introduction of representative elements into the Governor-General&apos;council must, to the extent to which it succeeds, result in practice in limiting the exercise by the Governor-General of the special powers vested in him personally, with a corresponding de facto limitation of the powers and responsi-bilities of the Secretary of State and of Parliament itself. While, however, itis important that these consequences of the changes now proposed should befrankly recognised and accepted, it must at the same time be made perfectly clear that until there has been established in India an executive effectivelyresponsible to the Indian people through organised representative institutions,the powers and responsibilities of the Governor-General, the Secretary of State,and Parliament, cannot be abrogated.16. Nothing contained in any of these proposals will affect the relations of the Crown with the Indian States through the Viceroy as crown representative.17. The Viceroy has been authorised by His Majesty&apos;s Government to placethis proposal before the Indian Leaders immediately upon his return to India.His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that the leaders of the Indian communities willrespond. For the success of such a plan must depend upon its acceptance in Indiaand the degree to which responsible Indian politicians are prepared to co-operate with the object of making it a workable interim arrangement.18. If such co-operation can be achieved at the Centre it will no doubt be reflected in the Provinces and so enable responsible Governments to be setup once again in those Provinces where, owing to the withdrawal of the majorityparty from participation, it became necessary to put into force the powers ofthe Governors under Section 93 of the Act of 1935. It is to be hoped that inall the Provinces these Governments would be based on the participation of themain parties, thus smoothing out communal differences and allowing ministers to concentrate upon their very heavy administrative tasks.19. There is one further change which, if these proposals are accepted.His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest should follow.20. That is, that External Affairs (other than those tribal and frontiermatters which fall to be dealt with as part of the defence of India) should beplaced in the charge of an Indian Member of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive so far as british India is concerned, and that fully iaccreclited representatives shall beappointed for the representation of India abroad.21. By their acceptance of and co-operation in this scheme the indian leaders will not only be able to make their immediate contribution to the directionof Indian affairs,., but it is also to be hoped that their experience of co-operation in government will expedite agreement between them as to the method of Avorkingout the new constitutional arrangements.22. His Majesty&apos;s Government consider, after the most careful study of thequestion, that the plan now suggested gives the utmost progress practicablewithin the present constitution. None of the changes suggested will in any wayprejudice or prejudge the essential form of the future permanent constitutionor constitutions for India.23. His Majesty&apos;s Government feel certain that given goodwill and a genuine desire to co-operate on all sides, both British and Indian, these proposalscan mark a genuine step forward in the collaboration of the British and Indianpeoples towards Indian self-government and can assert the rightful position, and strengthen the influence, of India in the counsels of the nations.
