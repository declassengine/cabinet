THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945SECRET.W.P. (45) 304.V7th May, 1945.WAR CABINET.-        VEMPLOYMENT OF GERMAN PRISONERS IN AGRICULTURE.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.THE Secretary of State for War, in his memorandum W.P. (45) 292 of the10th May, suggests that as many as possible of the 160,000 Germans now in thiscountry should be put to work and that the 150,000 Italian prisoners working inthis country should be replaced by German prisoners transferred from theContinent.2, It is unlikely that the whole of the 160,000 Germans now in this country can be put to work. Over 4,000 of them are officers, and the other ranks includeappreciable numbers of ardent Nazis who may be unemployable. Altogether theseproposals would involve a serious shortage of prisoner labour to meet the demandsof the various Departments, totalling 730,000.3. In M.P. (45) 5 the Secretary of State for Scotland and I showed thatthere is a prospective man-power deficiency in agriculture of 100,000 man-equivalents in 1945-46 and 190,000 in 1946-47, after taking full account ofthe prisoners of war now employed in this country.4. The deficiency of 100,000 man-equivalents in 1945-46 would need a grossaddition to our prisoner labour of about 150,000. This, added to the 100,000prisoners at present employed in agriculture, made the total of roughly 250,000included as agriculture^ estimated requirements in Appendix A of W.P. (45) 292.5. The deficiency in agricultural man-power cannot be met other than bythe employment of more prisoner labour. Our suggestions that agricultural workers should be released out of turn from the forces have been rejected, andwe do not expect i that our colleagues will agree to stop completely the recruit-ment of young agricultural workers who in recent years have joined the forcesat the rate of 8,000-10.000 annually. There is no prospect of any appreciablenumber of workers transferring from other industries to agriculture when they become redundant in their present occupations. The Women&apos;s Land Army is adeclining force, and although propaganda to find new recruits for it is being organised, this will do no more than reduce the rate of wastage.6. I am satisfied that if we are to have any reasonable chance even of main-taining food production at its present level we must have substantially more german prisoner labour. To carry out the food production programme which hasbeen set for us would require that we retained all our present prisoner force(including substitution of Germans for Italians at present employed) and an addition of about 150,000.7. I must ask my colleagues, therefore, that there should be a total allocation of something approaching 250,000 German prisoners of war to food production.If this leaves insufficient prisoner labour for other essential industries, I suggestthat the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals should be amended.8. It would be useless to accommodate the bulk of the prisoners in very largecamps, since the employment of the prisoners would of necessity be restricted to areas within a near radius of the camps. I suggest that selected Germans.&apos;&apos;-(!-, those at present employed from prisoner camps (since they have given no11&apos;ou.ble in the past) might now be transferred to small hostels with a minimum ofguards and allowed, as many of them now are, to work in unescorted parties.[29904]Copy No.    ?j?
These steps would contribute towards a solution of the accommodation problem,which might be further eased by housing non-Nazi prisoners, from base camps oryet to be brought over, in hostels which are by no means full and in disusedBomber Command airfields and other similar accommodation.9. One complication, however, exists to which I must call attention. Atpresent some 17,000 Italians are billeted individually on farms or in villages.When they return to Italy it is highly probable that public opinion will not allow of their substitution in billets by German prisoners. It is therefore of the utmost importance from the point of view of food production on the particular farmsconcerned that the Italians who are billeted should not be withdrawn until weare in a position to supply substitute British labour.10. The foregoing proposals would of necessity involve the transfer to thiscountry of non-Nazis, rather than exclusively of Nazis. As I have already stated,these are the minimum requirements if food production is to be increased. the farmers are prepared to continue their efforts to grow crops and to produce milk,meat and eggs to the maximum extent possible. Their output must be largelygoverned by the labour available to them. It is hopeless to look for continuedproduction at a high level if adequate prisoner labour, which they know to beplentiful in Europe, is withheld from them. Nothing would more quickly leadthem to believe that the Government does not really attach importance to achiev-ing the production targets.R. S. H.Ministry of A griculture and Fisheries, S.W. 1,17th May, 1945.
