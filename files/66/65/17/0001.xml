BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,21st April, 1945.-    ANNEX.Report of the Official Committee for the Co-ordination of departmental action on the end of Hostilities in Europe.1. At the meetings of the War Cabinet and the Lord Presidents committee held on the 12th* and 13th Apriif respectively, the Official Committee for theCo-ordination of Departmental Action on the End of Hostilities in Europe were asked to examine certain questions.2. Maintenance of Essential Services. The Lord Presidents committee invited the Official Committee to reconsider, in the light of the discussion on theproposals in the Postmaster-General&apos;s memorandum (LP. (45) 87), what essential services should be maintained during the holiday period for the cessation ofhostilities with Germany, with particular reference to the payment of wagesand allowances.3. The Government announcement approved by the Lord presidents committee at their meeting on the 29th March (L.P. (45) 18th Meeting, Minute 1)and made on the 4th April, contains the following passage : &quot; It is necessary to point out that workers in essential services or engaged on essential maintenance work must, in the national interest, be prepared tocarry on as required. Special compensatory arrangements will, of course,be necessary in their case. This applies particularly to those engaged in thesupply of gas and electricity, in the maintenance of valuable and importantplant, in food distribution and in the operation of vital transport.&quot;As regards passenger transport services on VE-day, Ministry of war transport will concentrate on arrangements to get workers home as quickly as possible from their places of work. It is unlikely that special arrangements can he made for late night services as transport workers will probably not agreeto operate them.* W.M. (45) 42nd Conclusions, Minute 5.iff f L.P. (45) 20th Meeting, Minute 2.[29768]
On VE 4-1 clay, passenger services will generally be based broadly on thoseoperated on a non-working day (Sunday or Bank Holiday) which are slenderin the early part of the day but thicken in the afternoon and evening; these willbe supplemented as far as possible according to requirements.On both days there will be maintained essential services for passengers,B.L.x\. leave and ambulance trains, service stores and personnel movements,newspapers and mails, and perishable food-stuffs.As to work at the ports, Ministry of War Transport feel that it will bedifficult to secure that the necessary dock labour will be available over the holiday period.The baking industry have pointed out to the Ministry of Food that difficultiesmay arise in the distribution of bread owing to the fact that on VE-day andthe following clay many of the retail shops in which bread is sold will be closed.If VE-day fell on a Friday, this difficulty would be accentuated, since the shopswould be closed on three consecutive clays. The representatives of the industry have suggested that to meet this difficulty two or three days&apos; warning shouldbe given of VE-day in order to enable consumers to lay in stocks.4. So far as Post Office Services are concerned, the proposals put forward in L.P. (45) 87 would mean that on the day following VE-day, apart from theChief Offices in the largest cities, which are always open, roughly half of the1,600 Crown Offices would be open 40 in London from 9 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.,and 700 in the Provinces from 9 a.m. to 10.30 a,m. (Scotland 9 a.m. to 10 a.m.) and of the 23,000 scale payment Post Offices roughly 9,000 in the Provinceswould be open from 9 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. (Scotland 9 a.m. to 10 a.m.). The only alternative to this, would be to arrange to open all the Crown Post Officesfrom 9 a.m. to 12 noon and all the scale payment Post Offices from 9 a.m. to10.30 a.m. The main hardship likely to arise from the closing of Post Officesis in relation to the payment of pensions and allowances and the position wouldbe specially difficult if VE-day were to fall on a Friday with the result thatold age. pensioners might have to wait until the following Monday for theirpayments.5. With regard to the payment of wages, difficulties will undoubtedly ariseshould the holiday cover one of the days on which wages are normally paid,and it would be desirable to avoid including Friday in the holiday period.Industrialists are alive to the problem and will make what arrangements theycan to ensure that wages are paid.6. The Banks propose to remain open during normal hours on the dayof the announcement and to remain open until 12 noon on the following day. Thisshould meet all essential requirements. It will be impossible to declare a formalbank holiday, but it is not expected that this will give rise to any serious difficulties in the application of the usual bank holiday arrangements with regardto remuneration and conditions of work.7. If it were possible to announce in advance the elate of the VE-Daycelebrations, the difficulties mentioned in paragraphs 3 to 5 would be largelyremoved. Moreover, although the Banks have not been consulted about this possibility, it might be that they would decide to close during the two days&apos;holiday, which would enable a formal bank holiday to be declared. The arrange-ments for VE-day were, of course, first considered on the assumption that the day would be that of the conclusion of an armistice or formal act of surrender andthat the date was therefore outside our control. If, however, as now seems probable, the occasion for celebration is a declaration that organised resistanceis at an end, it should be possible to select the day, at any rate within certainlimits, and therefore to give advance public notice of it, if that were thought wise.The objection is the risk of a partial stoppage of work as soon as the&quot;advancepublic notice is given, thereby causing dislocation and slowing down the war effort. But the advantages in facilitating the maintenance of essential services during the holiday period are such that it should perhaps be considered whether,when the time comes the Government could announce that organised resistance iscoining to a close and that the celebration of VE-day will begin on(a specified date, say, a week ahead).It may be decided that the objections to giving advance notice of the elateof the celebrations outweigh the advantages.  If so, consideration ought to be givento the question whether, in order to mitigate the difficulties connected with thedistribution of food and the payment of pensions and wages, matters should be sarranged that VE-day does not fall on a Friday, or indeed that the VE-day
holiday period does not include a Friday. It might also be worth considering whether steps could be taken to bring home to the public in advance the conditionswhich would prevail during the holiday, so that they might not be whollyunprepared.8.   It is suggested that the following points should be considered :  (a) In view of the difficulties inseparable from the declaration of two days&apos;holiday without prior notice, would it be possible for the Governmentto give advance notice of the date of VE-day, say, a week ahead?(b) Failing this, would it be desirable (i) in fixing VE-day to exclude Friday from the holiday periodaltogether or, at least, to avoid the choice of Friday as VE-day?and(ii) to try to bring home to the public in advance the conditions whichwill prevail during the holiday period?(c) On the assumption that it is not possible to give advance notice of thedate of VE-day but that it is possible to avoid including Friday inthe holiday period (i) are the arrangements for the continuance of essential services ingeneral satisfactory ?and(ii) in particular, are the proposals set out in the first sentence ofparagraph 4 for limited opening of Post Offices acceptable ?Date of VE-day.9. The War Cabinet asked the Official Committee to report on thefollowing point. In view of the risk that formal celebration of the end of the organised resistance by Germany might cause a dangerous relaxation in thenational effort, would it be desirable to associate any celebration with somesignificant point in the progress of the war against Germany, such as the fall of Berlin, rather than with a declaration that all organised resistance was atan end ?10. The Official Committee&apos;s view is that, if an event such as the capture of berlin was made the subject of official celebrations, such celebrations could notbe treated as merely an incident in the progress of the war, but would, in fact, beregarded by the public as signifying the virtual end of serious fighting in Europe;and that the result on the war effort would be more harmful than the selection ofa date when resistance in Europe could be declared to be at an end save perhaps in a few isolated11. Consideration of the question has been overtaken by expressions of views by S.C.A.E.F., Field-Marshal Alexander and the Chiefs of Staff on thismatter. All are strongly of opinion that no official celebration should take placeuntil resistance can be declared to be at an end except in isolated areas. In thesecircumstances it will perhaps be agreed that the suggestion that seme earlieroccasion might be chosen for the celebration need not be pursued.Date of the End of Hostilities for A administrative Purposes.12. The War Cabinet also asked the Committee to examine whetherVE-day ought to be regarded, for administrative purposes such as thecontinuance of labour controls, as the end of hostilities in Europe; or whetherdifferent dates should be chosen : (i) for celebrating the end of the war in Europe,(ii) as the date on which for administrative purposes the war in Europe was regarded as at an end, and (iii) as the legal date for the end of the war againstGermany.13. The Official Committee were clear that the main administrative measures, such as the relaxation of labour controls, planned to take effect at theend of hostilities with Germany ought to be put into force from the date onwhich VE-day is celebrated. This would not preclude Departments frombringing into force certain measures, e.g., the relaxation of blackout restrictions,prior to that day, and there might also be certain other minor administrative measures which it would be convenient to postpone for some time after that day.Legal date of the end of the war.14. So far as war legislation is concerned, no difficulty seems likely to arise.Provision is made in each of the various Emergency Powers Acts for the Act to
continue in force until an Order-in-Council is made declaring that the emergencythat was the occasion of the passing of the Act or of a related Act has come to anend; and a different date may be chosen for the end of the emergency for thepurposes of each of the Acts or groups of Acts.The position as regards leases is governed by the Validation of WartimeLeases Act, 1944, which contains provisions designed to clear up doubts as to themeaning of such expressions as &quot; the war,&quot; &quot; hostilities &quot; or &quot; the emergency &quot;occurring in tenancy agreements. These provisions can be applied either inrespect of all States and theatres or particular States and theatres.With regard to contracts other than leases, it seems probable that consider-able difficulties will arise in construing the wide variety of expressions whichhave been adopted to indicate the end of the war, particularly where these expres-sions contain terms such as &quot; the Armistice.&quot; The problem is being looked intoby the Emergency Legislation Committee, who have reached the provisional con-elusion that some legislation will be required to clarify the position and have arranged that Parliamentary Counsel should prepare a draft Bill.
