Reply by The King to the Addresses of Congratulationfrom Parliament.Thursday, 17th May, 1945.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,I am glad to meet you here to-day, and rejoice that the Dominions, Indiaand the Colonies are also represented here.I thank you for your loyal addresses of congratulation on the completevictory which has been gained in Europe over the enemies which sought toenslave it. It is a victory which has been won by the efforts of all My peoples andthe power of all our Allies.First let us pay tribute to the men and women of our Armed Forces. Withoutthe skill of the Commanders and the courage and endurance of those whom theyled, this victory would never have been won.Despite all that a ruthless foe could do in attacks by sea and air, the royal navy, aided by the Royal Air Force and the maritime forces of the Dominions,India and the Allies, have kept the seas open. They have convoyed our Armiesto every theatre of war and carried them to the assault against shores whichthe enemy had thought to make impregnable.The Merchant Navy, by their courage and sacrifice, have moved men and weapons to all parts of the world and, with the fishing fleet, depleted by theneeds of war, have brought to us a steady flow of food and supplies which has never failed.The gallantry of the Army which fought in Europe against overwhelmingodds in 1940 and the miraculous rescue from Dunkirk will ever be remembered.In the years that followed, the Army, with the Home Guard, stood readyto defend our homes against invasion. All this time the powerful instrumentwas being forged which, with the Forces of the Empire and Commonwealth, atfirst alone and later with our Allies, drove the enemy from Africa and then,landing on the shores of Sicily and Italy, and later on the Normandy beaches,swept victoriously across Europe.We are grateful to the Royal Air Force and the Dominions and Allied AirForces. The Royal Air Force fought and won the Battle of Britain. They sharewith the Royal Navy and our Armies the imperishable glory of their victories.For more than five years, hand in hand with the ever-growing magnificent Airpower of the United States, they carried the war into the heart of Germany,and, by their massive onslaughts on the enemy&apos;s sources of supply, paved the way for victory in Europe.My Armed Forces still hav^ heavy tasks before them in the Far East, wherdnumbers of My people are still in the power of the enemy. Already they have achieved great successes in the defence of India and the liberation of Burma..I am confident that they will carry on the war against Japan with indomitablecourage and constancy and help to bring it to a victorious conclusion in truecomradeship with the superb Forces of the United States and other Allies.        vAt home My people have unflinchingly borne the burdens and dangers ofwar. The thanks and admiration of all are due to tens of millions of men andwomen who toiled, all at their allotted tasks, to relieve the suffering and repairthe devastation caused by enemy attack. Danger could not deter My people fromcarrying out their daily tasks, that the life of our Nation might go on.In field, factory, mine, office, workshop and on the lines of transport, my people have toiled day and night in a productive effort to equip and maintain the armed Forces. Moreover, from the earliest days of the war, they have shoulderedthe burden of heavy taxation and have willingly contributed their savings to thecountry&apos;s need.Our gratitude goes out to all, and it would be unfitting to single out one typeof service when all have played their part.
But I must specially mention the women of this country, who by their readyresponse to the calls of industry and the Fighting Services have added so greatly to the weight of our impact on the enemy. Let us remember too the housewivesof this country, so many of whom took into their homes mothers and children fromthe bombed cities and workers uprooted by the war.I have done My best to discharge My duty as the Constitutional Sovereignof a free people, and in this task I have been unceasingly helped by The Queen,whose deep and active sympathy for all My subjects in pain or peril and whosefirm resolve for victory have comforted Me in the darkest hours of the war.We mourn the loss of all who have laid down their lives at home and abroad.The Queen and I would wish to offer Our sympathy to those whom the war hasstricken with the loss of their nearest and dearest. We Ourselves have sufferedthe keenest grief at the loss on active service of My Brother, the Duke of Kent.I have felt deeply for My loyal subjects in the Channel Islands who have remained steadfast for so long under enemy occupation and it gives Me joy toknow that they are once again free.Throughout our long struggle, all of us in this island have been strengthenedand cheered by the staunch and valiant support of the peoples of the BritishCommoirwealth and Empire overseas. My Dominions, India and My Colonieshave all given generously of their manpower and material resources, and all will continue to bear their share of the exertions of the war against Japan.We rejoice to acknowledge, and we shall never forget, the aid so freely andpromptly given by the United States, and the brotherhood of our Armed Forcesserving together in various theatres under combined commands. The splendidvictories of the Soviet Union, and the courage of all those other Allies who sufferedand fought with us in our common struggle against aggression will ever be recorded in our hearts and in our history.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,The rebuilding of Europe will bring with it trials and difficulties which canbe met and overcome if we continue to work together in faithfulness and mutualhelp as we have clone during the war.The ravages which we ourselves have suffered during the war will call for anintense creative effort by all members of the community to restore and improve thestandard of living of My people.The Grand Alliance of the United Nations which has brought us victory can and must continue, to ensure that the peace of the world is not again outraged and destroyed. The purposes for which the United Nations have been linked in wardo not end in victory. Mankind looks forward to a time when all nations, underGod&apos;s good providence, will be able to work together in mutual confidence for theseexalted aims.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,This Palace of Westminster in which we meet to-day bears the scars of war,and you have faced unmoved the ordeals and the losses of these hard years. the queen and I have been deeply touched by your congratulations and We thank youwith all Our hearts for the wise counsel and unfailing support which you havegiven to the Kingdom and Empire throughout the war.
