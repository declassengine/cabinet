DOCUMENT IS THE PHOIGOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.W.P. (45) 306.IQth May, 1945.WAR CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I feel I must draw the attention of my colleagues to the serious positionin which we find ourselves with regard to the future policy for Palestine. It hasbeen generally felt that His Majesty&apos;s Government should be ready with their new Palestine policy if possible by the end of the European war, and certainlyby the time the remaining quota under the White Paper of 1939 will be exhausted.The war in Europe is now over and the quota will be exhausted by aboutSeptember. But for various reasons there has as yet been no decision even onthe main lines of policy.2. In December 1943 the Committee on Palestine submitted to the &quot;WarCabinet a Report* (the Minister of State dissenting) recommending a policy of partition. The War Cabinet considered .this report at a meeting held on the25th January, 1944, and approved it in principle. The Foreign Secretary, how-ever, reserved his final view as regards the scheme as a whole pending furtherinformation from his Representatives in the Middle East as to the likely Arabreaction. It was not until the autumn of 1944 that the Prime Minister directed that this subject should again be placed upon the War Cabinet Agenda. Afurther memorandum elaborating the scheme of partition was submitted by thePalestine Committee, but before the matter could again be discussed with theWar Cabinet the. murder of Lord Moyne occurred and the Prime Ministerdecided that it was impossible to consider this subject until terrorists&apos; acts hadbeen brought to an end. In February this year I again raised the subject, butas at that time it was known that the Minister Resident in the Middle East wasabout to submit his comments upon the Palestine Committee&apos;s views, any con-sideration was deferred until the receipt of his memorandum.3. This memorandum has now been received and has been circulated to theWar Cabinet (W.P. (45)214). In this memorandum the Minister Resident rejectsnot the detail but the whole principle of the Committee&apos;s recommendation forpartition and proposes instead a policy based on the continuance of a bi-nationalState in Palestine. The general lines of this memorandum have been welcomed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. On the other hand, although Iadmit that the course of events since the last report of the Committee has tended to reduce the chances of a favourable reception for the partition scheme, and toincrease the possibility of reactions from both Jews and Arabs, I cannot see inthe memorandum of the Minister Resident an alternative scheme which promisesa more hopeful or peaceful solution of this intractable problem. In essence theMinister Resident recommends a return to the pre-White Paper policy, with onebig innovation that the immigration policy for which we shall have to takeexecutive responsibility, will be settled not by us but by an International Com-mittee. It is clear, therefore, that there is between us a clear-cut difference on a major question of principle which can only be decided by the War Cabinet.* W.P. (43) 583.[29894 1
4. I have discussed with the Minister of State what -further work isrequired upon the Minister Residents outline scheme before the War cabinet could fairly be asked to decide upon it. We do not feel that his plan need be worked out in the same detail as has been done for the partition scheme.Fewer administrative changes are contemplated and it is on principle ratherthan on details that the War Cabinet will have to decide, whereas, of course,in the partition scheme it was only after the details could be shown to be practicable that the scheme as a whole could be acceptable. We think, therefore,that if the Minister Resident were asked to return at once in order to amplifyand expound his scheme to the Cabinet he would, after any discussions he required with the Foreign Secretary and myself, be in a position to give to theCabinet such assistance as they needed. This would obviate the necessity forlengthy consideration of details which wmild be unlikely to affect the WarCabinehs view, but might unduly postpone a decision which is now becomingso urgent.5. There is one further point to consider. The White Paper quotas wallbe exhausted by the autumn, and it wall be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment then either to be ready with a new Palestine policy or to negotiate ifpossible some temporary continuance of Jewish immigration until such time asan announcement is possible. Both the Minister Resident and the HighCommissioner think there is some possibility of such a temporary arrangementbeing negotiated both with Jews and Arabs. I cannot say that I share theiroptimism, but if there is no chance of His Majesty&apos;s Government being able toproduce a long term scheme by the autumn, then certainly the effort to negotiatethis continuance is worth making. Members of the War Cabinet will knowbetter than I can whether in existing circumstances, both of the war and of internaljpolicy, there is a reasonable possibility that a major decision of this kind canbe taken in time. If it can, that of course is the best solution. If there ison the other hand little possibility of this being done, then I feel that theMinister Resident and the High Commissioner should be authorised as soon aspossible to start these negotiations. Nothing could be worse than to fall between two stools and to arrive in September with no decision on major policy and no agreement for the continuance of the immigration quota.6.   My proposals therefore are(1) that the Minister Resident be invited to return at once and that as soonas possible thereafter the War Cabinet should be prepared to decide as between the respective plans;(2) that, if the War Cabinet feel that the possibility of a hnal decision upon policy before September is remote, then the Minister Residentand the High Commissioner should be instructed to take whateversteps are possible to secure the temporary continuance of jewish immigration after September, pending the final decision on long term policy.1 0.
