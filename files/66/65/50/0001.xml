Secretary of State for the Colonies.1,     As my colleagues will be aware from the telegrams^ whichhave been circulated to them,  the United Kingdom Delegation at san Francisco has for some time been engaged in discussions onthis subject with representatives of the other sponsoringpowers and of Prance, as. well as in initial meetings of theCommittee on &quot;Territorial Trusteeship&quot;.      On May hth, both theUnited Kingdom and the United States Delegations published the drafts of a chapter on this subject for inclusion in the charter of the World Organisation.      It was made clear that, both paperswere intended as a basis for discussion on the analogy of theoriginal Dumbarton Oaks proposals.2.      The United Kingdom draft,  the  text of which is in Column of Annex I,  is based on the policy approved by the WarCabinet at their h2nd Meeting.-t-.      The essential feature ofthe United States draft s  the text of which is in Column 3 of annex I, is the division of territories under  trusteeshipinto two categories (A)  strategic areas and (B)  ether areas:all functions of the world organisation would be exercised in territories in category (A) by the Security Council,  in territories in category (B) by the General Assembly assisted by a special Trusteeship Council.      The United States clearlyintend that all  territories which they wish to acquire shouldbe placed in category (A).      Apart from certain militaryobjections to which the chiefs of Staff have drawn navy^nAioai/the United States proposals are open to the politicalobjection that, by&quot;making it possible far the United states to secure the territories in which they are interestedfree from any trusteeship &quot;strings&quot; they would remove theone incentive the United States have to  take a sensible andrealistic view of trusteeship provisions in other mandated territories.3.      Lord Cranborne has now telegraphed a new draft produced bythe United States and the United Kingdom Delegations as a workingtext which the five Great Powers can commend to the Committee onTerritorial Trusteeship as a basis for discussion withoutprejudice to the rights of any of them to discuss in committee any point of disagreement.      He asks for very early approval of this new draft  the  text of which is contained in Column C of Annex I.It has not yet been shown to the Russians,  the French,  and theChinese, but has been discussed in confidence with the DominionDelegations and Lord Cranborne states that they appear to agreefac its use as a basis of discussion though&quot;   not commiting them.The Russians have meanwhile tabled certain amendments to theoriginal United   States draft.      These are set out in Annex II,and some account of them has boon taken in the new draft.Lord Cranborne whose telegrams were received here only yesterdayasks for a reply if possible to-day.    I sent him an immediatereply to say that certain points were fundamental and would need reference to the Cabinet.* Telegrams Nos.  2&quot;BB anof&quot;2f5&quot;9* from Unfbod Kiiiiidom Delegation san francisco to &quot;Foreign Office,h W.M.

236   ih..     The new draft is &quot;based essentially on -.;he original Unit  iStates draft and retains the proposed division&apos;of territories under trusteeship into two categories (a) strategic areas and(D) other areas but includes in paragraph 7 a provision intendedto meet the military objections made by the Chiefs of Staff.The military implications of the new draft are being considered separately by the Chiefs of Staff but it clearly does not meetthe general political point made in paragraph 2 above.    Mycolleagues will wish to consider whether we should continue to oppose on political groundsP the proposed division of trusteeship territories into two categories.    In this connection,it should be noted that RussiajFrance and China have allaccepted this feature of the United States proposals.5.     Apart from this general point, there are- four other majormatters arising out of the new draft on which I feel I must seek the views of my colleagues,these are:-(i) Paragraph 2(c) of Section B.    This would require that in territories under trusteeship equaltreatment should be ensured for all members of theUnited Nations in social, economic and commercial matters.    Such a provision would make it verydifficult if not impossible to secure the modification of the provisions in the existingB Mandates which confer equal rights for all nationals of States members of the League with the nationals of the Mandatory Power in respect of entry and theconduct of business.    This modification was a specific objective of our policy as previously-approved by the War Cabinet &quot;f.    Lord&quot;Cranborne has emphasised our difficulties, especially inC Mandates to which the &quot;Open Door&quot; provisions donot at present apply, but the best he has been ableto achieve is the addition of paragraph 5 which isintended to preserve the existing rights of a state in territories under trusteeship.    This paragraph 5may meet the difficulty as regards  &apos;C&apos; Mandates butseems to do nothing to help us towards the modification we desire in B Mandates.    LordCranborne would have preferred the substitution of&quot;equitable&quot;  in place of &quot;equal&quot;  in the proposedformula in paragraph 2(c) but the United Statesinsist on &quot;equal&quot;.    This is so important that i recommend that we should insist on &quot;equitable&quot;.(ii) Paragraph, k cf Section B.    This paragraph providesthat the &quot;trusteeship arrangement&quot; for each territory should be agreed upon by the &quot;State or Statesdirectly concerned&quot;.    This is strongly pressed bythe United States Delegation which has refused toadopt the phrase &quot;State entrusted with theadministration of the territory&quot; used in paragraph kof the original United Kingdom draft.    The UnitedStates Delegation interpret &quot;states directly concerned&quot; to mean the Allied and associated powers except Italy and Japan.    Our legal advisersat San Francisco do not accept this view and consider that it will give rise to insoluble legaldisputes.    Lord Cranborne also draws attention tothe possibility that other states (e.g. Russia)may succeed in claiming that they are &quot;directly concerned&quot;,    and this view is supported by theRussian proposal (see Annex II)  that &quot;statesdirectly concerned&quot; should read &quot;states which wereor are directly concerned&quot;.    Whatever the words doin fact mean they are capable of signifying that proposals for a variation of the -terms of existingMandates could not be submitted for the approval of^ /the+ W.Pi(4-5) 228* W.M,(L5) h/2nd conclu sions.

the organisation without the uriux1agreement of a group of States claiming to heconcerned.    I recommend that we stand firmso far at least as our existing mandated territories are concerned on the phrase inparagraph k of our own draft viz:- that thedetails of the &quot;trusteeship arrangement&quot; ineach territory would be matters for agreementbetween the State entrusted with theadministration of the territory and theUnited Nations.(iii)    Paragraph 6 of Section B   This paragraph wouldprovide that even the designation of the state to exercise&quot; the administration of any territory under trusteeship should be amatter for agreement by the &quot;state or statesdirectly concerned&quot; and for subsequentapproval by the organisation.    We could not possibly agree that there could be anyquestion of reallooation of any of our existingMandates to another Power,(iv)    Paragraph 12 of Section r.    The proposal that&quot;the General Assembly, and under its authority,the Trusteeship Council should be empowered f*fco.make periodic visits to the respectiveterritories at times agreed upon by the administering state&quot; is most objectionable.It will be seen (Annex II) that the Russianamendment would go further in this direction.The impossible position in which we should beplaced by a provision enabling the general assembly to intervene actively in all mattersof administration in mandated territoriesrequires no emphasis.    The most we could accept,  so far as our existing Mandated Terr.i-toj.*ie*iare concerned, would be that the Trusteed *PCouncil should be empowered to make visitsat the invitation of the administering State.6*   I have generally qualified rny recommendations in thepreceding paragraph by the limitation that I am concernedespecially with our present Mandated Territories.Wo should not admit that our position in those Territories .Is opon to any question or can be varied without our fullconsent0   Field Marshal Smuta made this point very clearly at no British Commonwealth meetings- on hth April.I recommend that Lord Cranborne should be instructed that if our essential objectisssss are not accepted in the presentai8Hussions at San Fr&amp;nciseo His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom,  though they will be willing to adapt themselvesto the now machinery which is to replace that of the League ofNations, will not agree to any modification of their rightsand position in their present mandated territories.In our original draft Annex I Column (a)&apos; this was statedolearly and unequivocally in the last sentence of paragraph k*-[his is. now dropped in favour of paragraph 5 of the new draftAnnex I Column (c) v/hich appears much less premise,.in character*There has been no time to get a legal opinion upon whether th-* ^now paragraph,   despite its obvious imperfections in dra^-iivr,will give us the same protection as our original provision.1 do not think We ought to abandon our position,  until we havekeen able to  satisfy ourselves that the&quot; suggest-ocl amor.ojne.nt0es in fact provide the same safegnnvds.O.S. owning street,--,:u&apos;th May* 19^5. _________t B.C.M.l+5 2nd meeting page 9,
