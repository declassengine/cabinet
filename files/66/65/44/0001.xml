(45) 294.HWi May, 1945.Copy No. 37WAR CABINET.PURCHASE AND SALE OE HOUSING COMPONENTS AND houses by THE MINISTRY OF WORKS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT its meeting on the 23rd April, 1945 (W.M. (45) 49th Conclusions,Minute 3), the War Cabinet authorised the drafting of a Bill to enable theMinister of Works to make agreements for the production of housing materials,component parts and complete houses, to buy such items, to sell them to localauthorities and certain other persons, and to erect houses on behalf of localauthorities. Subsequently questions were raised whether legislation was neces-sary to enable the Minister of Works to carry out such functions, and the LawOfficers are now satisfied that legislation is not necessary for that particularpurpose. They agree, however, that it will be necessary if effect is to be givento the Treasury view that the proposed operations should be financed by meansof advances from the Consolidated Fund, since all charges on the Consolidatedfiuid must be authorised by specific statute.The above conclusions were reported to the Legislation Committee at its meeting on the 8th May, 1945, when the Committee expressed the general viewthat it was desirable to avoid legislation on this subject and that the best coursewould be to finance the operations from the Vote of Credit. The Committeesuggested that if I was unable to accept their views the matter should be brought before the AVar Cabinet at the earliest possible opportunity.2. I do find myself unable to accept the Committee&quot;s proposal to use the vote of Credit for this service for the following reasons : (a) The essential purpose of a Vote of Credit is to provide during a war for services the cost of which cannot be closely estimated in advanceor cannot be published without detriment to the public interest. Nosuch considerations arise in the present case.(b) While it is true that the ambit of the Vote of Credit covers any service&quot; arising out of the existence of a state of war,&quot; we should certainlyinvite Parliamentary criticism if we interpreted those words ascovering all continuing post-war schemes of resettlement and recon-struction which might have no less a claim than the present housingproposals to be regarded as arising out of the war.(c) Use of the Vote of Credit means that the prior specific authority ofParliament is dispensed with, and no opportunity of detailed Parlia-mentary criticism is offered. In a matter such as housing, which isalready the subject of a large body of detailed legislation, Parliamentmay reasonably expect that it shall be consulted before any notabledeparture is made in the arrangements at present authorised by statute. Moreover, I am sure that we should be wise not to adopta course which would seem to be designed to evade Parliamentstraditional control over public expenditure, particularly in view ofthe great demands which will be made on the Exchequer in the years to come.[29870]
(d) Although the present scheme is to be limited to houses expected to bocompleted by the 1st October, 1947, there may well be a demand forits continuance after that date. It is at least possible that Votes of credit will not continue until the date mentioned; and it is undesi-rable that a service which will continue in peace conditions and mayhave ultimately to be financed by other methods should be charged tothe Vote of Credit for the first time after the end of the European war. If the Vote of Credit were not to be used, the alternatives would be to finance this service either by an ordinary Supply Vote or by means of advancesfrom the Consolidated Fund. In my view, it would be objectionable to charge to annual Votes large sums which are essentially of the nature of working capital for commercial operations. Even if such charges are temporary, pending the proceeds of sales, they distort the total of recurrent annual expenditure to beprovided for out of an annual revenue. Advances from the Consolidated Fundare an obvious and proper means of providing such finance. That course has infact been adopted in recent housing legislation, viz., for the provision of temporary houses under the Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act, 1944, and for the financing of the building of houses by the Scottish Special Housing Associationunder the Housing (Scotland) Act, 1944.4. I therefore ask the War Cabinet to decide that the proposed operations of the Ministry of Works should be financed by means of advances from the consolidated Fund.The necessary Bill would be short, and, we may hope, non-controversial.While I do not think that we could be criticised for the delay necessary to giveParliament an opportunity of considering the Bill, I entirely agree that such delayshould be reduced to a minimum, and I think the Minister of Works would bejustified in entering into contracts, if he desires to do so, as soon as the Bill hasobtained its Second Beading. It would not, of course, be possible to make anyadvances out of the Consolidated Fund until the Bill had become law.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.. 1.Uth May, 1945.
