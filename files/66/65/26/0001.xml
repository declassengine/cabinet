Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET. I Copy No..........                          \W.P. (45) ,276.28th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.REGISTRATION OF BUILDING WORKERS.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.1. The rate at which houses can be built depends very largely on the rate at which building labour (and civil engineering labour which is needed particu-larly for site preparation but is largely interchangeable with building labour)can be made available to do the work.2. To increase the labour force for housing to 800,000 by the end of thefirst year after the German war, which is the basis on which the proposals inthe recent White Paper on Housing (Cmd. 6609) are framed, I am relying onreturning more than 200,000 building workers from the munitions and otherindustries. I am not at all certain that I shall be able to do this by waiting forthe labour to be thrown up on redundancies. What is more, so that still morehouses can be built than is envisaged in the White Paper, I want to improveon this figure if possible. That can only be done by making all the building workers in other industries available for return to the building industry. Forthis purpose I must register them.I could carry out such a Registration within about six weeks and I ask forthe agreement of my colleagues to this proposal.3. I shall need to register both craftsmen and labourers with previous experi-ence in the building and civil engineering industries. The labourers, thoughusually referred to as &quot; unskilled workers &quot; have, in fact, a degree of acquiredskill and experience which makes them a vital part of the labour force for buildingoperations.4. Experience has shown that firm action must follow a Registration ifsubstantial results are to be achieved and, as in the case of the ex-cotton opera-tives, all those registered should be held to be available for withdrawal fromtheir present work without exception.5. There is a possibility that the Registration, and it is certain that mostof the consequent transfer action, will take place after the announcement of theend of organised resistance in Europe. It should be appreciated therefore thatthis proposal will entail the continuance, for some time after the announcement,of a substantial use of my powers of direction; otherwise the purpose of the Regis-tration might well be largely frustrated. We are pledged in the White paper on Re-allocation of Civilian Man-power (Cmd. 6568, para. 29) to use these powers sparingly and only for directing persons to essential work of the highesturgency. The urgency of essential housing seems to me to justify clearly theuse of the powers for getting back to the industry men who have previously worked in it and who can be made available.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,28th April, 1945.[29802]
