THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1945.Copy No. O iWAR CABINET.POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTION BY GUATEMALA against british HONDURAS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.GN the 28th April a telegram was received from the Governor of british honduras stating that anxiety existed in the Colony regarding the possibility ofmilitary action by Guatemala against the Colony and intervention by Mexico*to secure the northern part of that Colony for herself and that the danger was a real one.2. Urgent consideration was given, under the authority of the Ministerof Defence, to the problem of reinforcing, should the need arise, the one company of the local defence force which is the only unit of ground troops available inBritish Honduras. It appears, however, that the rumour arose because of thepresence of Guatemalan troops in a region adjoining British Honduras where theyare engaged in fighting a forest fire, and it is not now thought that there is any danger of Guatemalan attack.3. Nevertheless, my colleagues may wish to know from me the circumstancesof the dispute between British Honduras and Guatemala. This is long-standing and arises out of a Convention concluded in 1859, the object of which was todetermine the boundary between the two countries. Article VII of thatConvention bound the signatories conjointly to use their best efforts to establish a means of communication between the capital of Guatemala and the fittestplace on the Atlantic coast in British Honduras. That Article has never been implemented although at various times His Majesty&apos;s Government have madeefforts to reach agreement with Guatemala as to the measures which should betaken.4. The Guatemalan contention is that this Article was meant to compensatethem for an alleged southward extension of the territory of British Honduras,that since it has never been implemented the Convention is null and void andthat thus Guatemala has a valid claim either to the whole of the Colony or alternatively to the southern part, as part of the old Spanish Captaincy-Generalof Guatemala.5. We have offered to submit to arbitration the questions raised by article VII but we do not admit that it is solely our fault that it has never beencarried out and we can point to several offers in the past to carry out our shareof the bargain. Even if we were held to be at fault over this Article we do not agree that the 1859 Convention is thereby null and void, nor, even if it were, could we agree that Guatemala was the general assignee of Spanish rights and claims in Central America.6. Guatemala has never accepted an offer which we made in 1940 to submit to arbitration the question whether or not there was any breach of Article VIIof the 1859 treaty and if so what penalty should be awarded, even although we* The boundary between Mexico and British Honduras is laid down by a treaty of 1893and the Mexican Government have repeatedly made it clear in the past that- they have nowish to raise the question of revision (to which they have no legal claim whatever) on theirown account. If, however, there were any question of ceding part of the Colony to Guatemala,then Mexico would at once lay claim to the Northern part of the Colony.[29827]SECRET.1W.P. (45) 282.3rd May, 1945.
L2presented draft arbitral terms which, we said, would enable Guatemala to bringher territorial claims before the tribunal, though we should naturally contend that the tribunal could not and should not consider a cession of territory.7. I cannot agree that the terms of arbitration which were offered toGuatemala in 1940 should be widened in any way which might lend support tothe Guatemalans in pressing on the tribunal their claim that the arbitral awardshould include a cession of territory. In my judgment any such action, whichwould increase the possibility of transferring a population of several thousandswho have long been under our rule to another sovereignty without any expression of desire on their part, would be abhorrent to all modern ideas.8. In recent years Guatemalan claims on British Honduras have become more and more extreme, and have been accompanied by recurrent Press campaignsand the publication of inaccurate and misleading White Papers. On the recentexpulsion of President Ubico, an extreme Nationalist Government has come into power. The new Constitution adopted by the Constituent Assembly includes a claim that the whole of British Honduras is Guatemalan territory, and a british note of protest was rejected by the Guatemalan Government which reiterated itsclaim to the whole of the Colony and in addition claimed compensation for Britishpossession of the territory over so long a period.O.-S.Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,3rd May, 1945.
