My colleagues will remember that the Lord President of the Councilcirculated on the 2nd August last a Note and Annexes (W.P. (44) 425) which gave an account of some of the work carried out at the Road Research Laboratory,Iiarmondsworth, on a number of problems connected with the invasion of theContinent in June last.2. It occurred to me that my colleagues might like to have a correspondingNote on the work carried out by the Civil Defence Research and ExperimentsDepartment showing how, by co-operation with other Departments of State andthe fighting services, data obtained from Civil Defence research and experience has been applied to Offence. This note has now been prepared and is appended.My colleagues will, I think, agree that the document gives a very interestingaccount of a development of considerable significance to the active prosecution ofthe war which few would have thought to be within the scope of a Ministry ofHome Security.3. The work of the Research and Experiments Department has beencomprehensive and varied. It is difficult in a short account to do justice to its full range but the applications of the data obtained from civil defence research and experience to Offence are illustrated by selected German targets such as thesubmarine pens at Brest, the Mohne dam, the Samur tunnel, industrial cities suchas Dusseldorf, industrial plant such as that at Regensburg, &amp;c. Research andexperiment on camouflage, smoke and decoy, gas precautions, warning devices,black-out and lighting restrictions, illuminescent material, &amp;c, are excluded fromthe present account as appertaining more to the basic side of civil defence. for reasons of space scant mention is accorded to topics such as physiological research,fire research, fire fighting methods and incendiary bomb devices in which research and Experiments Department has played a predominant part.4. Particular attention is drawn to the illustrations and diagrams describing the basic Civil Defence work, such as that on shelters (including tunnels andheavily reinforced types) and on fire fighting methods. The effects of Germanraids on British cities such as Birmingham are also portrayed.5. Mention may be made of special investigations undertaken for theServices on German and Japanese forms of building construction, and the studies of oil and other special plants.   These are illustrated in the appendix.H. M.Home Office and Ministry of Home Security,24:th April. 1945.[29759]


Prefatory note the activities of the Research and ExperimentsDepartment of the Ministry of Home Security havebeen so varied that they cannot be pictured fully in these few pages. So a selection has been made and arranged more or less in chronological order,giving priority to the applications of Civil Defenceexperience to problems of attack, thereby bringingout how the work of the Department outgrew its originalscope.&apos;Research and experiment on camouflage, smoke and decoy,gas precautions, warning devices, blackout and lighting restrictions,luminescent materials,etc.,have had to be excluded, and scant mention accorded to oth^r topicssuch as physiological research, fire research, fire-fighting methods, incendiary bomb protection devices.Little has been said on the early studies in civil defence organization.Most of the illustrations are from the records of theDepartment, but acknowledgment is made to the Air forces for the air photographs so freely used.

introduction.     The Reseprch and Experiments (R   ft E ) Branch of theHome Office (afterwards the R. ft E. Department of theMinistry of Home Security), was set up in February, 1939*to apply scientific inquiry to the many new problems arising out of the ejects on the life of the civilpopulation from air at+ack.     As a means for securingauthoritative outside help, the Lord Privy Seal appointed the Civil Defence Research Committee to advise on theformula+ion and execution of programmes of research andexperiment.     A broad programme was ^evise^, one sectionof it stressing fundamental research on the effects of high explosive weapons, blast, fragmenta+ion an4 earth-shock.Experimental studies on a model scale were undertaken on behalf of R   ft E   by the Department of Scientific andIndustrial Research, more especially at the Road research laboratory and the Building Research Station.     Trialsusing ^ull-size bombs were begun by R   ft E, direct, anda regional organization was evolved to survey and reporton effects in the field.     Data from all sources werecritically analyzed and correlated with theoreticalstudies pursued simultaneously, both at the R   ft Eheadquarters in Princes Risborough, and extramurally.2.     In this way, theory, experiment, and experience weregradually fitted together to build up a rational under-standing of the relation between weapon and effect.   bombs were identified from their fragments, their penetrationwas related to the craters formed, traces of the explosivefilling were analyzed, and all these were compared withdamage plots and casualty surveys mads at the same time -the latter, by the Department&apos;s Oxford Extramural Unit,with particular success.     Equally, the larger effects of bombing, on morale, factory production, transport, etc.,were examined in the ^enartmenfs social surveys.3.     By 19hi, these s+udies enabled R   ft E   to predict thematerial damage by blast, earthshock, and fragments forany bomb-size and type, as wel1 as to draw general con-elusions on the effects of bombing.     Other Ministriessoon availed themselves of the facilities, first developed for M.H.S. in the TI.S.7.R. and other laboratories, andthere has been the closest co-operation between all those interested 6  . The absence of any natural boundary betweenknowledge useful for civil defence and knowledge useful for attack was fully realized, and R   ft E   has collaborated,   with the fighting services in many ways.     &quot;^or example!R   ft E   supplied estimates of the effectiveness of the
larger light-cased bombs (h,000-12,000 lb.), and urgedtheir use in area attacks.     Its early appreciation ofthe great blast damage caused by German parachute minesmade it an advocate of the use of aluminized explosives,R   &amp; E   co-operated in the tests which led to thesuccessful attacks on the MBhrie and Eder Dams, arranging the field trial against the dam in the Elan valley.They also made the estimates of the effectiveness oflarge earth-shock bombs when the 12,000 lb. Tallboy bombwas first envisaged.     Similarly, the Departments workon tunnel shelters enabled it to advise on the effect-iveness of bombs against tunnel stores;     its field trialsagainst heavily reinforced concrete shelters provided datafor the attack on submarine pens and fieldworks etc,lu   By extending its laboratory and field experience intotheory, the Department was able to apply its finding to new weapons.     Its predictions and its share in fieldtrials were of great assistance in devising means to clearGerman minefields.The mathematical work involved in all this directedattention to cognate statistical problems, among them theprobable efficiency of attack against limited objectives.Thus the Department assisted in advising on methods of attack, and in computing the likelihood of success,against railway and road bridges in occupied France.Similar work, both engineering and statistical, was carriedout on the Rhine bridges.$,   Finally, to apply such work immediately to the offensive, a special Division of the Department was formed in co-operation with the Americans, to assess and advise on british-American attacks on enemy towns, factories, and special structures.     For this purpose, a technique ofphotographic interpretation was developed, which relateddamage seen to damage suffered in the light of British ex-perience.    The same experience and technique were used toanalyze the structural characteristics of targets in advance,so that the most effective weapons might be chosen.In the Department the performance of allied bombs against enemy targets has been studied in detail, including the performance of incendiary bombs.     The mechanism ofincendiary attack has been analyzed, and the lessons arebeing applied against   Japan.     The Department has, inaddition, trained the personnel for a special organizationnow set up in Washington, in which the techniques devolped in the Department are being used to plan the Pacific air offensive.




SHELTER PROTECTIONBefore the outbreak of the war, Shelter Policy-had been formulated and certain shelter designs,adopted - eBg. Anderson Shelter, Basement ShelterTrench Shelter, Blast and Splinterproof surface   *er semi-surface Shelter, Bomb-resisting Shelter,Field trials were arranged to test the structuresin the light of war experience - e.gc the Ander-son shelter was tested to determine the extentto which it afforded protection against theincendiary bomb (e.g. - the I.B.E.N.) These testsconfirmed the soundness of the original policy.^MORRISON SHELTERTesting apparatus used in the developmentof the Morrison Shelter. It was later usedfor comparative tests on other patternsproposed by other bodies.Field test at Hendon. Houses damaged bybombs and due for demolition were collapsedon the table shelter.Field test - Morrison Shelter containingdummy, after collapse of house.TRENCH SHELTERSMany trench shelters were tested on Salisbury Plain and at Stewartby, againstbombs with delay-action fuzes. Good and bad features were differentiated.Designs were decided upon before the outbreak of war. Their behaviour under air-raid conditions was noted, The lessons learnt led to trials on new and improveddesigns in reinforced brickwork. Later, methods of strengthening original shelterswere developed.
STRUTTED REFUGE ROOMSReports by the R &amp; E field staff on air raid incidents revealed how timberfloors held together in one piece. Designs for strutting of refuge rooms weredeveloped^ Photograph illustrates field tests in houses due for demolition -one with and one without strutting.MODEL HOUSESTrials in Richmond Park to investigate the laws correlating damage with blast,and the effect of window openings.DUMMY MENField tests on dummies to determine the conditions under which people arehurt by &quot;windage&quot; from bombs causing violent displacement.GLASSTests on anti-scatter treatment for windows,(a) Circumferential fracture - window forced inwards by near explosion.(b) Radial fracture - window breaks outward by suction of blast from a more distant explosion.FACTORY PROTECTIVE WALLSFull scale trials at Stewartby, to determine the best designs for Factoryprotective walls.
Fire research has peace-time as well as war-timeapplications - but in war added problems are pre-sented. R &amp; E has been concerned both with funda-mental problems and those relating specifically to air.attack. Some such problems concern equip-ment, others the development of fire fightingtechniques.Appropriate structural protection was designed toprevent the entry of incendiary bombs into build-ings,&apos;and means of limiting the spread of fires were suggested,, A technique was developed and adopt-ed by the Services for zoning towns according tofire hazards Industrial hazards were studied andled to improved protection in the flour mill ind-industry and in the transport, storage and handling of oil and petrol. Improved methods have beenfound for dealing with aircraft crash fires.The lessons learnt from British experience havebeen applied, in cooperation with M.A.P., in thedevelopment of new forms of I.B.&apos;s, and advicehas been given on the best methods of attack.As a defence against concentrations oflarge numbers of small incendiary bombs,numerous small parties were trained and equipped to deal with as many bombs aspossible in the incipient stages. Thework of R &amp; E gave the Fire Guard the civil-ian helmet and instructions  on thebest way to deal with each new type ofincendiary bomb as it arrived.



THE APPLICATION OF EARLY DEFENCE DATA    H1941-4Field trials -were carried out on tunnelsto obtain fundamental data on safetydistances from bombs for Civil defence purposes.From tunnel trials, defence data weregiven to the Services and variousMinistries on the vulnerability ofunderground headquarters, stores andshelters including those at MALTA and gibraltar, and offence data on enemyconstructions.Experiments were made on the ToldishTunnel for COMBINED OPERATIONS to obtaindata on hasty demolition of tunnels.From tests, data were supplied for the design of TALLBOY.From the survey of British Railways under german air attack, it was established thatthe longest traffic delays result fromsevere damage to tunnels.
1942     forStudies were made of theconstruction of typicalGERMAN DOMESTIC STRUCTURES.The data were used in the design of German atticsbuilt at B.R.S. for incend-plenipoteniary bomb trials.The data were also used in estimating the probable effects of our H.E. bombs -large and small -For   similar work   for the pacific Offensive see 31,32GERMAN   HOUSE

jMr9 B. N. Wallis proposed the use of avery heavy medium case bomb in attackingpower supply, oil installations, etcFew targets-^appropriate for such a bomb&apos; were then in existence,    /-sA number of targets had appeared, the&quot;large sites1 in Normandy and Brittanywere under construction. A bomb waswanted for use against large earth-works, canal banks, etc. Mr. Wallisdesi(gfted the 12,000 lb. TALLBOY. estimates of its performance against various targets,based mostly on smaxD scale work, were madeby R &amp; E and by  R. R. L.R &amp; E was able to report that out of four&quot;large sites&apos; three were seriously damaged by Tallboy. The design proved to be moreversatile than originally supposed. Tallboycould be used, not only as an 1 earthquake1,but also in direct attack on concrete, as a semi-armour piercing bomb, and even forarmour-piercing proper - the TIRPITZ.TALLBOYAND  SCATTER   PATTERNIn January, 19UU COMBINED OPERATIONS desiredto determine the nature of the sub-soil of selected beaches on the Continent in order toascertain whether the passage of tanks wouldbe prevented by soil conditions. Beaches werecratered to observe the nature of the debris,the crater itself and the effects of tide onthe crater lip - from aerial cover. R &amp; Bcooperated in a full scale trial at Bran-caster staged by Combined Operations.Bombs of various sizes and types were ex-ploded. By comparison it was possible todetermine the soil composition of specificbeaches on the European Coast line.
