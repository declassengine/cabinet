THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 298.nth May, 1945.WAR CABINET.PUBLICATION OF STATISTICS ON THE SHORTAGE OF FOOD.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.1. I was asked by the Lord Presidents Committee (L.P. (45) 23rd Conclu-sions, Minute 2 (d)) to prepare a Memorandum setting out the statistics of the prospective deficiencies in food supplies during 1945 which, in my view, itwould be desirable to publish and the advantages to be gained by their publication.2. The attached paper, which has been prepared in consultation with theMinisters of Production and Food, sets out the sort of information which I hadin mind.3. It is in my view essential, if we are to bring home to the agriculturalcommunity&apos; and to the public generally the need for maintaining for some considerable time to come maximum effort in food production in this country,that these facts should be made known. I recently circulated to County war agricultural Executive Committees, in confidence, the statistics contained inthe table in the attached note. Many of these Committees have subsequentlyimpressed on me the difficulties they are meeting in convincing the rank and file of farmers of the need for sustained effort, and they urged me to assist themby making the facts generally known. The publication of this information,particularly in the farming press, will be of the greatest possible assistance tome, to my Department and to our County War Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees in their task.4.   The Ministers of Production and Food agree.R. S. H.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W. 1,* 12th May, 1945.I. World Food Shortage.The following table gives estimates of world supplies and requirements ofcertain foods-atVvrrent consumption levels-in 1945, including requirementsof liberated Europe but excluding Japanese-held territories. The estimates usedare those worked out by the Combined Food Board at the outset of the inter-Governmental discussions of food shortages last month and relate requirements to supplies from current production, viz,,,.before taking account of stockreductions.Thousand tons.supply from Current GrossCommodity.

II. The United Kingdom Position.It has become clear, in recent months, that the world is facing a serious shortage of many of the principal foods. The Minister of Production and theMinister of Food have recently visited Washington to discuss with the UnitedStates and Canadian Governments what steps should be taken to meet the numerous deficits which exist. As a result of these discussions, decisions havebeen come to which will share the burden of the inevitable cuts in foodconsumption among many countries, both those which export and those whichimport food. It is clear, however, that considerable reductions in consumptionwill have to be made by the United Kingdom and it is therefore essential thatthe agricultural community should continue to maintain the maximum effort in food production in order to reduce the gaps to a minimum.The following notes on some of the principal commodities illustrate the seriousness of the united Kingdom position.Sugar. After providing supplies for liberated areas at a rate of consumptionfar lower than pre-war. it has been necessary to accept a reduced rate of alloca-tion to this country. The quantity of sugar thus supplied will entail a reductionof over 300,000 tons in our sugar stocks, and a reduction in consumption even onthe low 1944 figure. The United States and Canada are accepting even biggercuts on their current consumption.Oils and Fats. To meet the deficit, the United Kingdom is reducing itsstocks by about 350,000 tons by the end of July 1946. The Combined Food board in Washington is expected shortly to make revised allocations for 1945 based onthe latest supply estimates. It is clear that reductions in consumption in theUnited Kingdom as well as in the United States will be necessary.Meat and Bacon. No meat can be expected from the United States duringthe third quarter of this year. Canada has undertaken to make substantial additional quantities of meat available, but it will only be possible to maintain a total consumption of 100 lbs. per head in the United Kingdom during the latter part of the year compared with 115 lbs. in 1944. A reduction in the bacon rationhas already been announced. The meat ration can only be maintained with difficulty. Our meat stocks by the end of the year will be down to their absoluteminimum.Eggs. Because of the present procurement difficulties it may be necessaryshortly to reduce both priority and non-priority consumers&apos; entitlement of packeddried egg.Dairy Products. We shall have to draw heavily on our stocks of skim milkpowder. Unless further quantities of evaporated milk are forthcoming it willbe very difficult to meet service requirements. It may be impossible to maintainthe present 2 oz. cheese ration.Rice. Because of the deterioration in the world supply position, it wasnecessary to&apos;suspend allocations of rice to the general public on the 1st April.There is little likelihood of a resumption this year.Wheat and other&apos;Grains. Although the total world supplies are probablysufficient to meet requirements, there are grave difficulties of shipping and internaltransport in the exporting countries.
