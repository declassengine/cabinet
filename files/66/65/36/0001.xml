JMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITMAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTiiiPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET.Copy No,oW.P. (45) 286.22nd May, 1945.WAR CABINET.GRANT OF PAH) LEAVE TO SERVICE CANDIDATESAT THE GENERAL ELECTION.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.IN my reply in the House of Commons on 10th April to Mr. Parker&apos;question (Cols. 1694/5) I explained that Service candidates for parliament would not draw pay from Nomination Day until the declaration of the poll.The question remained whether paid leave should be granted to candidatesbefore Nomination Day. By minute of 15th April (M.. 340/5), I asked theService Ministers to concert a common policy.War Office regulations provide that a C.O. may make use of his powers togrant up to 28 clays&apos; compassionate leave &quot; for urgent private affairs &quot; to grantleave to an officer or soldier, who has been recognised as a candidate, for thepurpose of addressing meetings and canvassing in his constituency. admiralty and Air Ministry regulations contain no similar provision.The Service Ministers and the Treasury are now agreed that the War Officeregulations should be applied, in all three Services, subject to the proviso thatif any privilege leave is clue, the 28 days&apos; special leave will count against it,and any leave shall terminate not later than the day preceding Nomination Day.No privilege leave will be granted in addition to the 28 days, but disembarkationleave for which candidates returning from overseas might be eligible would be additional.I have authorised the Service Ministers to proceed accordingly.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,22nd May, 1945.[29939]
