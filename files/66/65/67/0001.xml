THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government copy No.   tJ .WAR CABINET.INDIA : INDUSTRIALISATION AND COMMERCIALDISCRIMINATION.Report by the India Committee,AT the request of the Secretary of State for India we have had underconsideration the line to be taken in dealing with certain proposals which havebeen received from the Government of India bearing on the CommercialDiscrimination provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935.2. The matter has arisen consequent on consideration given in India to thearrangements to be made for the post-war development of Indian industry.The Government of India have it in mind to take far-reaching steps, summarised in Appendix A to this Report, to encourage the rapid industrialisation of india with State assistance and under State control.3. Sir A. Dalai, who is the member of the Governor-General&apos;s ExecutiveCouncil for Planning and Development, is of opinion that effect cannot be givento these arrangements consistently with the commercial discrimination provisionsof the Government of India Act, 1935, and he has proceeded to this country atthe request of the Government of India in order, inter alia, to discuss the matterand to see what steps can be taken to surmount the difficulties which he anticipates.The proposals which he wishes His Majesty&apos;s Government to consider are set outin the Acting Viceroy&apos;s telegram 748 S of the 25th April which is attached as appendix B to this Report.The Background.4. The War Cabinet will remember that the provisions included in sections 111 to 121 of the Government of India Act, 1935 (a summary ofwhich is appended to this&apos; Report as Appendix C), wrere the subject of close and anxious consideration when the Government of India Bill was before Parliament. There was great apprehension on the part of commercial interests in this country and of British commercial interests in India as to thepossibility of discrimination to their disadvantage. In the outcome specificguarantees were given to British commerce that its position would be effectivelysafeguarded. The provisions of Chapter III of Part V of the Act of 1935&apos; &quot; Provisions with respect to Discrimination, &amp;c.&quot; Sections 111 to 121 were designed for that purpose. It was on that understanding that difficulties thatmight otherwise have arisen in connection with the passing into law of theGovernment of India Bill were surmounted.5. Those provisions have since been in operation. So far as the centralGovernment of India is concerned, Part II of the Act of 1935 not yet havingbeen introduced, the special responsibility which under Federation would be vested in the Governor-General under Section 12 (1) (e) of the Act has not comeinto being. But the Governor-General has power to intervene under the pro-visions contained in the Ninth Schedule to the Act if in his view the interests ofBritish India are essentially affected. He can also, under Section 314 (1) ofthe Act, incoke the Secretary of State&apos;s direction. In the case of the provinces,[29912] B9 f] P&apos;d \J *JPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 317.19th May, 1945.
any infringement of the provisions now under discussion would attract thespecial responsibilities of the Governors under Section 52 of the Act. whether in the Centre or in the Provinces, legislation or executive action in contravention of the provisions of the Act would therefore call for intervention by the Governor-General or the Governor as the case might be.6. We are informed by the Secretary of State that in the course of a debate in the Indian Legislative Assembly on the 2nd March, 1945, on a motion torecommend the repeal of the Sections in question, the present member of theGovernor-Generals Council for Planning and Development, Sir A. Dalai,undertook &quot; ostensibly by inadvertence, since his undertaking was directlycontrary to a previous decision by the Executive Council as to the line to be takenin the debate,&quot; that the Government of India would enter into negotiations withHis Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; for the modification of the commercial discrimina-tion provisions of the Act of 1935,&quot; and that the results would be reported to theIndian Legislative Assembly. The proposals summarised in Appendix A to thisReport have since been embodied in a public statement, issued by the Governmentof India without prior reference to His Majesty&apos;s Government, and designed toexplain to the public in India the steps they had in mind to encourage the rapidindustrialisation of the country. They have inevitably attracted great attention,and it is against the background of Sir A. Dalahs statement in the LegislativeAssembly and of the subsequent publication of these proposals that the matter has now to be viewed.7. The India Committee have examined the resultant situation with theassistance of the Minister of War Transport, and of the Secretary of theDepartment of Overseas Trade, representing the President of the Board of Trade.They have also had the advantage of discussion with Lord Wavell.The Secretary of State for India&apos;&apos;s proposals.8. The Committee have had before them papers by the Secretary of Statefor India in which the Secretary of State has made the following proposals :  (a) As a first step Sir A. Dalai should be asked to discuss the matter witha body of officials drawn from the India Office, the Board of Tradeand the Treasury, assisted by the Legal Adviser to the Secretary ofState for India. This body should clarify the issues with Sir A.-Dalai and report back to the India Committee, but should have no authority to enter into commitments with him.(b) A decision as to how far His Majesty&apos;s Government might be ready togo should be taken for the confidential guidance of the proposed bodyof officials, but not for communication to Sir A. Dalai.(c) The Secretary of State advised us that his own view was &quot;that the,simplest and wisest course would be the complete repeal of the com-mercial safeguards. We shall have to drop them in the end, and now that the issue has been raised it is bound to be inflamed by our opposition, with consequences that can only harm Britishindustry, which is not in fact expecting the support of these provisions, and is not likely to thank us for exposing them to agitation. and possibly boycott.&quot;(d) Failing a decision to agree to complete repeal, the Secretary of state proposed that His Majesty&apos;s Government might (i) agree to introduce legislation repealing Section 116 of theGovernment of India Act (the substance of which is containedin Appendix C);(ii) make it clear to Sir A. Dalai that so long as the commercialsafeguards in general remain we cannot shut our eyes toflagrant action in the executive field contrary to their purpose;and(iii) express readiness (subject to (ii). above), to consider individual cases on their merits, and on certain understandings to under-take in suitable cases to seek to exercise our influence withparticular United Kingdom interests with a view to preventingthem from pursuing their plans to participate in India&apos;industrial development in a manner calculated to exacerbateIndian opinion.
Lord Wavell in his representations to us has also strongly urged the importanceof giving a sympathetic hearing to the Government of India&apos;s proposals and of meeting them so far as possible.9.   The India Committee have given full consideration to this matter.Arguments in favour of the Government of Indians proposals.10. In favour of action on the lines suggested by the Government of India,the following considerations have been advanced :-(1) Opposition on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government to action on thelines now proposed, may, given the publicity which it has received,have most unhappy effects politically, both in India and inter-nationally. His Majesty&apos;s Government should avoid any suggestionthat in the policy they propose to adopt they have been guided byconsideration of the interests of this country rather than the interestsof India. A decision which could be represented, however unjustly,as holding up the industrial development of India, and preventing the provision by an Inclianised Government of India of State assistanceto that end, under a measure of State control, would be gravelydamaging to us in the eyes of the world.(2) It has been our general policy for many years past to give India an increasingly free hand in matters affecting her own economy. the fiscal convention of 1921 provided that where the Governor-general in Council and the Legislature were in agreement His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom would not interfere. The spiritof that convention has, we are advised by the Secretary of State, inpractice been applied outside its particular scope, and we have tended to refrain from interference with the economic policy of theGovernment of India save where any challenge to the terms of thegoverning legislation was involved, although we have made repre-sentations when United Kingdom interests are affected. It wouldbe inconsistent with the general trend of that policy to place obstacles in the way of action on the lines now proposed by the Governmentof India for the development of Indian industry.(3) While it may be that the proposals for the development of Indianindustry now put forward have been formulated without consultationwith His Majesty&apos;s Government, and have been published without their approval, they should, it is argued, be regarded as being a direct and natural result of the authority given by the Cabinet to the presentViceroy on his appointment in October 1943 to examine in what manner the economic development of India could best be forwarded.It would be the more difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government, havinggiven an authority of that character to Lord Wavell, to refuse now toconsider its outcome, even though this should involve, as suggestedby the Government of India, the repeal of the commercial safeguards.(4) The commercial safeguards have, it is said, always been bitterly resentedin India. We are committed to their ultimate abolition by the Ministerof Aircraft Production^ statement in India in 1942 that their maintenance would not be a condition of His Majesty&apos;s Government^acceptance of a new Indian Constitution agreed among Indians; and bythe Duke of Devonshire&apos;s subsequent statement in the House of Lords onthe 30th July, 1942, that we hoped that the matter would be dealt withby discussion between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the future government of India negotiating with each other as equal partners.It is very desirable in these circumstances to avoid a first-classcontroversy which might do our post-war trading prospects in Indiamore harm than good, and reduce the chances of satisfactory-arrangements on a treaty basis being concluded with a future IndiaGovernment.(5) Currently accepted ideas as to the function of the State in industrialdevelopment have greatly changed since the Government of india act was passed, and it is not reasonable that the financial assistance which the Government of India now propose to give to Indianindustrial initiative should also be available to United kingdom interests.[29912]
(6) The commercial discrimination proposals of the Act of 1935 were designed to safeguard British commercial interests in India. What-ever doubts may be felt as to the wisdom of the industrialisationproposals now put forward by the Government of India, we couldnot plausibly justify the retention of the commercial discriminationclauses, if they were shown to make that industrialisation impossible,on the ground that it was not in the interest of the Indian masses.(7) Although Indian legislation to implement the Government of India&apos;plans for the industrial development of India would probably not initself be discriminatory and would consequently not be affected bythe Government of India Act, 1935, this Indian legislation could notbe used in the case of at least some industries, to benefit Indianinterests only, without executive action discriminating againstUnited Kingdom interests. This could not be allowed unless Sections111 to 118 of the Act of 1935 had previously been modified.Arguments against the Government of India&apos;s proposals.11.   On the other hand, substantial arguments have been advanced againstthe repeal or drastic modification of the commercial safeguards, and indeedagainst the scheme of industrialisation proposed by the Government of India;and we set them out as fpllows : (1) Issues of grave importance are involved in any proposal to abolish orto modify the commercial safeguards contained in the Act of 1935.Those safeguards were an essential feature of the Act of 1935. the statements made by the Minister of Aircraft Production and theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for India in 1942 as to our readiness to see them modified or abolished were made on theassumption that any modification would be consequential on, or atany rate preceded by, the establishment of self-government in India.Until that condition has been satisfied there can be no justification for asking United Kingdom interests to abandon the protection whichthey now enjoy in advance of a general settlement of India&apos;s future.Their abandonment without the previous conclusion of a satisfactorycommercial agreement would make it legally possible for the Govern-ments in India, before they undertake the responsibilities and obliga-tions of full self-government, to adopt measures calculated to driveexisting United Kingdom enterprises in India completely out ofbusiness.(2) The Minister of War Transport, and the Secretary of the Department of overseas Trade, speaking on behalf of the President of the Boardof Trade, contest the suggestion that this is a matter of slight concern to British commercial interests, or that those interests have for practical purposes discounted the safeguarding provisions of the act of 1935 in the negotiations in which they have recently been engagedwith Indian business. They regard the maintenance of these safe-guards as a matter of great importance to United Kingdom trade.(3) Is it desirable to abandon those safeguards for British commerce justwhen we are moving into a post-war period in which this country will have to face economic conditions of the utmost difficulty? Oughtthey to be sacrificed at a time when we owe an immense sterling debt to India, which even if materially scaled down can be paid only ifwe can increase our exports, and particularly our hidden exports \(4) Are the industrialisation proposals of the Government of India in theinterest of India as a whole, or do tJhey not represent a yielding to pressure from great industrial interests in that country which areunfriendly to the British connection, and indifferent to the welfare of the Indian cultivator? Ought not the improvement of Indianagriculture, and the increase of the purchasing power of the ryot,to precede extensive industrialisation ?(5) Is it in fact the case that the repeal of the commercial discriminationprovisions of the Act of 1935 is essential to India&apos;s industrial develop-ment, or even to the particular industrialisation proposals nowpublished by the Government of India? Is there in fact any necessaryconnection between industrialisation and discrimination? If not, is there not justification for feeling that in pressing for the repeal of the safeguards the Government of India have allowed themselves to bemade the victims of interests concerned to secure their privateadvantage rather than that of India?
(6) Proposals for the repeal of the safeguards come at a particularly unfortunate moment, when great endeavours are(being made to interestBritish firms in the possibilities of India, and to secure their friendlyco-operation in her economic development and the training of hernationals. Suggestions designed, or appearing, tc cut the groundfrom under existing British commercial interests in India cannot butbe an obstacle to these efforts.Views of the India Committee.12. The situation with which we are faced is a difficult one, and will need careful handling if His Majesty&apos;s Government are to avoid damaging misrepresented-sentation of their attitude. This is especially the case in view of the greatpublicity which has been given to the Government of India&apos;s proposals for furtherindustrialisation, and to the case for the abolition of the commercial safeguards.Government of India&apos;s proposals for industrialisation.13. We deal first with the Government of India&apos;s proposals for furtherindustrialisation. We are in no sense hostile to India&apos;s economic development :indeed, we welcome any steps that can properly he taken to encourage and fosterit. But the majority of us consider that those proposals are not in the interestsof the Indian masses, and would merely entrench Indian &quot; big business&quot; in aposition of monopoly; and that they are misconceived and unlikely to be to theultimate advantage of India. At the same time, the Secretary of State for Indiaand the Governor-General have strongly represented to us that in view of the relationship which has advisedly been allowed to grow up between His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Government of India in economic matters, it would be verydifficult to press an objection to these proposals on such grounds, and, though with some misgiving, we accept that view. Actually it is probable that theopposition to them in India will make their implementation without substantialmodifications impossible.Government of India&apos;s proposal for abolition of the commercial safeguards.14. We turn next to the Government of India&apos;s proposal for the abolition ofthe commercial safeguards of the Act of 1935. Sir A. Dalai, who was recentlya director of Tatas, and &quot;was one of the sponsors of the so-called Bombay Plan,and who, as explained in paragraph 6 above, has committed the Government ofIndia publicly to discussing this matter with His Majesty&apos;s Government, hasnow arrived in this country for that purpose. Refusal even to discuss thismatter will almost certainly be misrepresented to our disadvantage, and we oughtto try to prevent a situation arising in which we can be accused of havingsacrificed the interests of India to the interests of British industrialists.On the other hand, we are deeply impressed by the objections set out inparagraph 11 above to abolishing the protection accorded by and under theAct of 1935 to Unitetl Kingdom commercial interests in India against discrimina-tory treatment. If and when India achieves self-government, we readily agreethat it would be appropriate that commercial relations between her and thiscountry should be reviewed and settled by treaty. But a convention negotiated,on equal terms, with a self-governing and representative Government of india would be negotiated in circumstances in which this country could protect its own interests without exposing itself to the charge that it was taking advantage of its position as a trustee. It would not be open to the objection which would lie toany convention negotiated now, that it was negotiated with a Government ofIndia technically official in character, not responsible to an elected Legislature,nominated by the Crown on the recommendation of the Viceroy, and open to thesuggestion in a matter such as this that it was a puppet Government which hadtaken its orders in a matter of direct concern to the United Kingdom and theEmpire from His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.&quot; (The Act of1935 makes provision (Section 118 see Appendix C) for the negotiation afterthe establishment of Federation of a commercial convention which&quot; would replace the commercial discrimination provisions. But in the circumstances envisaged in Section 118 this would not be a freely negotiated convention, but would haveto reproduce in fact substantially the provisions of the Act which it is contem-plated to replace.)[29912] - B 3
15. We are clear, after full discussion, that there can be no question, inpresent circumstances, of any repeal of the commercial discrimination provisionsof the Government of India x4ct and&apos;that this should be made clear to Sir A. Dalai.At the same time, we think it important not to give the Government of India a grievance on the ground that they have not been allowed to argue their case andthat they have been faced in limine by a refusal even to consider the obstacleswhich the commercial safeguards in their view oppose to their plans for industrialdevelopment. We think in the outcome that the situation could best be dealt withon the basis of the formula set out in paragraph 16 below, which we recommendfor the approval of the War Cabinet. That formula, on the one hand, makes itclear that no question arises in the present circumstances of the repeal of thecommercial safeguards. On the other hand, it gives the Government of India asufficient assurance of our readiness to consider with sympathy any practicaldifficulties of an economic character in implementing their plans for the industrialdevelopment of India that the safeguards can be shown to present.16. The formula which we recommend for adoption as a basis for any discussions with Sir A. Dalai is as follows  &quot; Whereas it is not possible at this stage for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto do away with Sections 111 to 121 of the Government of India Act, 1935,which must await the time when a new convention or treaty can be agreed with a representative Indian Government, if in the course of working outnew schemes for industrial development in India, the Government ofIndia encounter any particular economic difficulties arising in special casesout of the legislation under Sections 111 to 121 of the Government of india act, 1935, His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to consider suchspecial cases with a view7 to seeing whether any agreed variation could bemade of the provisions.of those Sections so as to obviate those particular difficulties.His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that it might be helpful if discussions could be initiated by the Government of India between representatives ofBritish industry in India and Indian industrialists with regard to their co-operation over industrial development schemes in India.&quot;17.   Stimmary of Recommendations.(1) While we feel doubts about the soundness of the Government of India&apos;sproposals for industrialisation, we do not think that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment can wisely reject them lock, stock and barrel. (Para-graph 13.)(2) We are clear that there can be no question, in present circumstances, ofany repeal of the commercial discrimination provisions of the Govern-ment of India Act. and we are of opinion that this should be made clear to Sir A. Dalai.   (Paragraph 15.)(3) We recommend that Sir A. Dalai should be dealt with on the basis ofparagraph 16 of our Report.(4) We consider that there would be advantage in discussions on this subject with Sir A. Dalai taking place at the Ministerial and not at theofficial level.The Secretary of State for War agrees with No. (2) of our recommendations and has no strong views about No. (4). He is not in agreement with Nos. (1)or (3).Signed on behalf of the Committee,SIMON,Acting Chairman.Ivth  May, 1945.
APPENDIX A.The Government of India have recently issued a statement advocating far-reaching steps to encourage the rapid industrialisation of India with state assistance and under State control.   They contemplate in particular (a) bringing 20 basic industries by Central legislation out of the Provincialand into the Central field.  A list of these is annexed;(b) financial assistance by the Government of India to any of these 20 indus-tries which need it;(c) the possibility of nationalising a few industries;(d) the introduction of a licensing system under which no new factories orsubstantial expansions of existing factories can be proceeded withwithout a licence from the Central Government in respect of the 20centrally controlled industries or from Provincial Governments orStates in respect of other industries. This is designed to secure asatisfactory geographical distribution of industry and to preventindustrialisation taking a form which runs counter to the Governmentof India&apos;s overall plans;(e) tariff protection.  They are also believed to contemplate the maintenanceof import licensing for capital goods;(J) the purchase of the products of Indian industry by Government in pre-ference to others;(g) taxation remissions.(1) Iron and Steel.(2) Manufacture of Prime Movers.(3) Automobiles and Tractors.US Aircraft.(5) Ship-building    and    marine engineering.(6) Electrical Machinery.(7) Heavy   Machinery,   such   asTextile, Sugar, Paper, Min-ing, Cement and Chemical.(8) Machine Tools.(9) Heavy   Chemicals   and   FineChemicals, Chemical Dyes,Fertilisers    and    Pharma-ceutical Drugs.APPENDIX B.Telegram from the Acting Viceroy to the Secretary of State for India,No. 748-s, dated 25th April, 1945.DALAL unlikely to reach United Kingdom before 2nd May and full text of draft statement on safeguards which follows by mail should reach youwell in advance. There is no question of publication prior to discussion inLondon.   Following is brief summary.2. Paper begins with abstract of relevant Sections of the Act and mentionsspecial responsibility of the Governor-General under Section 12 and Governorsunder Section 52 in the administrative field. Indian opinion never reconciledto these provisions. Position irrevocably established during Cripps Missionthat they would not appear in the future constitution and would be replaced by treaty or trade agreement freely negotiated. Evidence of intense publicinterest in the subject is then quoted.3. Then follows summary of future industrial policy of the Government aslaid down in the statement already published.4. For purposes of safeguard basic industries may be taken to include alltwenty industries mentioned in the industrial policy statement as requiring tobe brought within the sphere of the Government of India legislative action, withthe exception of cement, sugar and cotton and wool textiles.5. In respect of basic industries Government of India propose that all new companies which operate in India should offer 70 per cent, of capital with corresponding voting rights to Indian nationals. Where existing british companies desiring to expand, extra capital if it exceeds twenty-five per cent, ofexisting capital or rupees ten lakhs, whichever is the less, should be subject to(10) Electro-Chemical Industry.(11) Cotton and Woollen Textiles.(12) Cement.(13) Power Alcohol.(14) Sugar.(15) Motor and Aviation Fuel.(16) Rubber Manufacture.(17) Non-ferrous Metals Industry.(18) Electric Power.(19) Coal.(20) Radio Engineering.
the same conditions. By British companies is meant companies with sterling-capital or with more than thirty per cent. non-Indian rupee capital and voting-right.6. Government of India appreciate that in case of new industries involvinghighly technical operations and use of patent rights British firms may be unwilling to participate on minority basis without effective voice in the manage-ment, British firms could in such cases take up managing agency of Indiancompanies for period not exceeding twenty years, which is the maximum allowedunder the Companies Act, but condition would be attached that Indian personnelshould be trained over all grades of industry. Further continuation of managingagency agreement would be matter of negotiation at the end of twenty years.7. Legislation to implement above policy would be ineffective at present inview of Sections 113 and 114 of the Constitutional Act and executive instructionsto same effect would invoke special responsibilities of Governors. Subsidies to indian companies with the object of assisting them to compete against british companies would be ruled out under Section 116. Guarantee of minimum rateof dividend and loans to Indian companies at less than commercial rates ofinterest would also be objectionable.8. It is not possible at present to state how different industries will be assisted or extent to which safeguards are likely to hamper development. Reportsof panels dealing with these subjects will not be ready for some time.9. Target of 3 million tons for iron and steel during first five years post-war period under consideration. If this is accepted at least one large additionalsteelworks must be established. Indian opinion will require that it should beowned and controlled by Indians. Capital might amount to rupees 20 crores.The necessary assistance to such a company could not be given owing to safeguardsections. Any British concern might erect steel plant with 100 per cent. Britishcapital and Government of India could do nothing.10. Similarly, electrical machinery is being manufactured by (corrupt group)satisfactory British combination which desires to increase capital four-fold andmight capture the whole business of manufacturing electrical machinery inIndia. Similar is the case of heavy chemicals industry. Rubber manufacturers are almost British and American monopoly in India. If these concerns expandsufficiently it will be impossible for Indian industry to establish itself.11. Again British interests might capture automobile, tractor and aircraft industries.12. In case of shipbuilding both Government and private enterprise willbe engaged but Government wish to ensure that private part of industry is underIndian control.13. Government of India earnestly desire that Indian industry should be developed by Indians with co-operation and-assistance of British industry. india is in need of both capital goods and technical advice and would prefer to get them from United Kingdom. There is great scope for increased trade and commerce between the two countries. Government of India have consideredpossibility of negotiating agreement with British industrial interests but are advised that agreement could not be implemented in view of Sections 12 and 52of the Government of India Act. They hope that if safeguard provisions cannotbe repealed altogether Act may be amended so as to enable Government of Indiato carry out the following objectives : (1) to impose conditions in respect of basic industries to leave controleffectively in native hands;(2) to be free to grant assistance to Indian companies in basic industriesfield as suggested in paper on industrial policy; and(3) in respect of other industries to enable Government of India and provincial Governments to grant subsidies to Indian  companieswithout being called upon to grant similar subsidies to british companies.APPENDIX C.Summary by the India Office of the Discrimination Provisions of theGovernment of India Act (Sections 111-121).Section 111 exempts British subjects domiciled in the United Kingdom fromthe operation of Indian legislation restricting their right of entry into british india or imposing, by reference to place of birth, race, descent, language,   &apos;
religion, domicile, residence or duration of residence, any restriction &amp;c, inregard to travel, residence, the acquisition, holding or disposal of property,the holding of &quot;public office or the carrying on of any occupation, trade, business or profession; Tn so far as under United Kingdom legislation British subjectsdomiciled in British India are free from like restrictions, &amp;c, in the UnitedKingdom.   There are a few other unimportant exceptions.Section 112 invalidates any Indian legislation imposing taxes discriminatoryagainst British subjects domiciled in the United Kingdom or against UnitedKingdom companies.Section 113 provides that United Kingdom companies, their directors,shareholders and officers, &amp;c., shall be deemed to comply with any Indianlegislation imposing, in regard to such companies carrying on business in british india, conditions connected with the place of incorporation of a company, thesituation of its registered office, the currency in which its capital is expressed,the place of birth, race, descent, language, religion, domicile, residence orduration of residence of the directors, shareholders or officers, &amp;c. It also ensuresto United Kingdom companies any preferential treatment in respect of taxationmade dependent on compliance with such conditions. It applies, however, onlyin so far as under United Kingdom legislation British Indian companies are free from like conditions, &amp;c, in the United Kingdom.Section 114 provides that British subjects domiciled in the United kingdom shall be deemed to comply with conditions imposed by Indian legislation as tothe place of birth, race, descent, language, religion, domicile, residence orduration of residence, of directors, shareholders, officers, &amp;c, of British Indiancompanies and extends to them any preferential treatment in respect of taxationdependent on compliance by British Indian companies with such conditions;in so far as under United Kingdom legislation British subjects domiciled inBritish India are free from like conditions, &amp;c, in the United Kingdom.Section 115 provides that no ship or aircraft registered in the UnitedKingdom shall be subjected by Indian legislation to any treatment affectingeither the ship or aircraft, its master, officers, crew, passengers or cargo, whichis discriminatory in favour of ships or aircraft registered in British India,except in so far as British Indian ships or aircraft are subjected in the UnitedKingdom to like discriminatory treatment.Section 116 provides that United Kingdom companies carrying on business in India shall be equally eligible as British Indian companies for any grant,bounty or subsidy paid on of Indian revenues for the encouragement of any trade or industry; in so far as British Indian companies carrying out business in the United Kingdom are equally eligible with United Kingdom companies for subsidies, &amp;c, paid in the United Kingdom for the encouragement of the sametrade or industry. Indian legislation may, however, stipulate that companiesnot engaged in the trade or industry in question when the Act granting thesubsidy, &amp;c, is passed, shall not be eligible for it unless they are registered inBritish Indian companies, 50 per cent, of their directors are Indians, and they give reasonable facilities for the training of Indians.Section 117 provides that sections 111-116 apply in relation to any ordinance,order, bye-law, rule or regulation made after the passing of the Government ofIndia Act.Section 118 provides that if, after the establishment of the Federation, aconvention is made between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Federal Govern-ment for similarity of treatment in any of the above matters for United Kingdomsubjects and companies in British India and British Indian subjects and com-panies in the United Kingdom, the operation of the above sections may to that extent be suspended by Order in Council.Section 119 deals with professional and technical qualifications.Sections 120 and 121 deal with medical qualifications.Under Section 52 (1) id) the Provincial Governors have a special respon-sibility for the securing in the sphere of executive action of the purposes whichthe above-mentioned provisions are designed to secure in relation to legislation.As regards the Centre, the Government of India are, of course, at presentsubject, over the whole field of their responsibilities, to the general control of theSecretary of State and must comply with any particular directions which he gives,in this matter as in others. The Act contemplates that, after the establishment ofthe Federation, the Governor-General shall have a special responsibility underSection 12 (1) (e) similar to that now held by Governors.
