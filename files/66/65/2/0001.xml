Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECEET. x/ Copy No.    o ^W.P. (45) 252.16th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.PORK, BACON AND EGGS.Note by the Prime Minister.I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the attached memorandumproposing certain increases in the home production of Pork, Bacon and Eggs,which has been prepared at my request by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries, the Minister of War Transport and the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Ministry of Food.w. s. c.10, Downing Street, SWA,IQth April, 1945.1. At the request of the Prime Minister we have examined the possibilityof increasing home production of pork and eggs.2. The present annual production as compared with that of pre-war isas follows : Pre-war. Present,[A verage of 3 years.) 1944-45.Pork        ......       182.000 tons 20,000 tonsBacon      ......       181,000 tons 97,000 tonsEggs        ...       ... 5,512 million 3,613 million3. We all agree that a substantial increase on present production isdesirable at the earliest possible time.
4. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries estimates that, given thenecessary additional feeding-stuffs from May 1945 onwards, production could beincreased by the following quantities :  In 1946. In 1947.Pork or Bacon ...        75.000 tons 110.000 tonsEgos        ...... 500 million 1,000 million a small increase of pork or bacon might also accrue in the latter part of 1945.5. This programme would involve, the following increase in supplies of feeding-stuffs over the existing quantities allocated to pigs and poultry : 1945. 1946 and subsequent years.(Mat/ to December.) (Twelve months.)520.000 tons 1.600.000 tonsOf this. 470.000 sons and 1.460.000 tons respectively would he cereals (wheat,barley, maize) and the remainder protein (oilcakes, fish meal, meat meal).6. While the Minister of War Transport is unable to find shipping for any additional feeding-stuffs before the end of the war in Europe, he thinks that inthe two or three months immediately following VE day he could load anadditional 300.000 tons of cereals, mainly from the Plate, and lie would hope tobe able.to ship substantial quantities in 1946.7. This 300.000 tons of cereals would mean an additional !docked sterlingor foreign exchange commitment of from  2 million to  3^ million accordingto whether wheat or maize can be obtained.8&apos;. Of the balance of 170.000 tons a part may possibly be provided fromany increase in home production of grain resulting from better weather conditions.The remainder could only be secured by drawing on our wheat stocks. Theseare at present at a dangerously low level, but there now appears to be a good prospect of securing tonnage and loading capacity sufficient to restore stocks bythe end of July to the minimum safe level, under war conditions, of 1.200.000 tons.On that assumption and provided the war in Europe is over before that date, theParliamentary Secretary on behalf of the Minister of Food, if the War Cabinetagrees, will be prepared to draw upon his wheat stocks up to a maximum of170.000 tons to meet the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s requirements set out inparagraph 5 above.9. There is a world shortage of protein supplies, but by encroaching upona small reserve stock of oilcake and economising in issues to other kinds of livestock (e.g., fattening cattle) it would be possible, with some difficulty, to find the additional 50.000 tons required. Additional supplies of fish offal from increased landings of fish, if these could be secured, would lie a great help.
10 To enable the additional quantities of cereals and protein to be pro-cessed and distributed, an increase will be required in the labour force availablein the processing factories and distributing trades. Before the increased issuescan be made the following additional men will be required :  Processing factories      ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       1,500Distributing trades      ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 50011. For 1946 and subsequent years an additional 1,600,000 tons of feeding-stuffs, foreign exchange to purchase so much of this quantity as needs to be imported, and labour for the factories and distribution, will be required.12.   The position can be summarised as follows :  (a) The Minister of Agriculture estimates that an increase of 75,000 tonsof pork or bacon and 500 million eggs can be obtained in 1946 from home sources if 520,000 tons of additional feeding-stuffs can beprovided in 1945 and 1,600,000 tons in 1946.(b) This programme is based on the following assumptions (i) that it can be safely assumed that VE clay will occur within thenext 2 months;(ii) that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is prepared to sanctionan additional blocked sterling or foreign exchange commitment of  2 million to  3  million in 1945;(iii) that the War Cabinet are prepared to agree to a lowering (ifnecessarv) of the stocks of wheat in the United Kingdom afterVE day:(iv) that the additional labour requirements set out in paragraph 10above can be met.13. The views of the War Cabinet are sought on this proposition. If itis decided to proceed it will be necessary for the Minister of Agriculture to make an immediate announcement of the Government fs intention to increase rationsto pigs and poultry and maintain them at the higher level so that producers canbegin at once to make their plans for increased production.E. S. H.L.W. M.lQth April, 1945.
