THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 259.18th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.PAY OF NURSING OFFICERS OF TFIE QUEEN ALEXANDRASROYAL NAVAL NURSING SERVICE.War Service Increments.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THE Secretary of State for War and the Secretary of State for Air have submitted a joint paper to the Cabinet contesting the Chancellors decision thatArmy and Air Force Nurses are ineligible for War Service increments. As statedtherein, these increments were granted to all ranks of the armed forces belowRear-Admiral, Major-General and Air Vice-Marshal, who have rendered threeyears reckonable service since the 3rd September, 1939 (Command 6553).2. Before expressing my views on the merits of the case for granting war service Increments to members of the Queen Alexanclra&apos;s Royal Naval NursingService, I wish to make it clear that I consider it essential that whatever decision is taken with regard to Army and Air Force Nurses should be applied also to naval Nurses, who are their exact counterparts. Nurses of all three services are paid the rates approved for nurses in civilian hospitals as a result of therecommendations of Lord Rushcliffe&apos;s Committee on Nurses&apos; Salaries (Command6424), and therefore as no distinction can be drawn on a pay basis between members of the Q.A.R.N.N.S. on the one hand and Army and Air Force Nurseson the other, the mere technical difference in status, due to the fact that NavalNurses are not commissioned, could not, of course, justify any discrimination against them in this matter. The difference in status, such as it is, betweenNaval Nurses and Army Nurses is precisely the same as the difference betweenofficers of the A.T.S., who hold commissions and are subject to the Army Act,and officers of the W.R.N.S., who do not hold commissions and are not subjectto the Naval Discipline Act. It has never been suggested that this differentiationis an adequate reason for refusing to give W.R.N.S. officers whatever benefits are approved for the A.T.S., and it would clearly be impossible for me to withholdWar Service Increments from Naval Nurses if they are conceded to Nurses ofthe other two Services.3. While I do not feel as strongly as the Secretaries of State for War andAir that refusal to pay War Service Increments would involve a breach of faith as pledged in the statement in the White Paper (Command 6553) that theseincrements are payable to &quot; women members of the forces,&quot; I would not wish to oppose the grant of such increments if the War Cabinet come to the conclusionthat public faith is pledged. It is, however, necessary to take into consideration the fact that War Service Increments have not hitherto been payable inconjunction with civilian rates of pay, neither has time on such rates been allowedto count as reckonable service for the purpose of these increments. A decision toextend payment to nurses in receipt of Rushcliffe rates might have repercussions on the position of men serving in the Royal Navy on Agreement T. 124 or variants,whose rates of pay are, generally speaking, based on those of the Merchant Navy,and who have accordingly been excluded from War Service Increments.4. The total number of Naval Nurses is 1,100, of whom approximately 400are serving overseas.A. V. A.Admiralty, S.W.1.18th April, 1945.Copy No.V[29743]
