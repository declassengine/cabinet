Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET.Copy No.&apos;W.P. (45) 279.1st May, 1945.WAR CABINET.ELECTORAL (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL : CANDIDATES&apos;EXPENSES.AS invited by the War Cabinet at its meeting on the 20th April (W.M. (45)47th Conclusions), the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland andI have had an informal consultation with the Members of Parliament who served on the Speaker&apos;s Conference, the Chief Whips and the Chief Party Agentsregarding the maximum scale of candidates&apos; expenses which was raised inSection I (a) and (6) of W.P. (45) 215.2. At this meeting I outlined the proposals, with the reasons, which I had put before the Cabinet for increasing by 25 per cent, the scale recommended bythe Speaker&apos;s Conference for the first General Election and subsequent bye-elections until (but not including) the second General Election and the doubt felt by some Members of the Cabinet whether an increase of 25 per cent, would besufficient. In the course of the full discussion which followed, and in which reference was made to the effect of the scale on different types of constituency, no member of Parliament advocated an increase over 25 per cent. A minority ineach party expressed themselves in favour of a 25 per cent, increase for theimmediate future and a further minority considered that, although a temporary increase would be justified, it ought not to be as high as 25 per cent. Others took the view that the scale recommended by the Speakers Conference would besufficient if Returning Officers could undertake the task of issuing poll cards atthe General Election and if halls and schools were made available to candidatesfree of hire, as recommended by the Carr Committee. These proposals wouldrequire legislation, and I am advised by the Returning Officers that they couldnot issue poll cards for a General Election this year on account of the heavy work involved at a time when very heavy pressure will be on them. The general &quot;feeling of the meeting was, however, definitely against disturbing the scale recommendedby the Speaker&apos;s Conference, which Members said had been recommended with fullappreciation of the rising price level.3. After carefully considering the views put to me at the meeting, I ampersonally not convinced that the 25 per cent, increase, which I suggested, wouldnot be justified in present circumstances for the first General Election and subse-quent bye-elections up to the second General Election, in order to enable candidatesto put the issues properly before the electors; but it is clear that any such increase would meet with strong opposition from certain quarters in the House. In myopinion, the scale to be fixed for candidates&apos; expenses is essentially a matter whichshould be determined by the House, and in the circumstances I recommend thatthe Government should insert in the proposed Bill the scale recommended by theSpeakehs Conference, and should leave it to the House to decide, if the point is raised (either by a free vote or by sensing the feeling of the House), whether thescale should be temporarily increased and, if so, by what amount.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1,1st May, 1945.[29819]
