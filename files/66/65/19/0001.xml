&apos;HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 269.25th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.CELEBRATION OF VE-DAY.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.THE War Cabinet at their meeting on the 9th April (W.M. (45) 41st Con-clusions, Minute 6) invited me, &quot; after consultation with the Commanders in theField, to arrange for the detailed plans for VE-Day to be worked out with theDepartments concerned, and thereafter to submit a further report to the WarCabinet,&quot; but having regard to the views expressed in telegrams of the 13th and14th April (appended to this Memorandum) received from General Eisenhowerand Field-Marshal Alexander, to the objections expressed in various quarters toany official celebrations before the defeat of Japan, and to the practical difficulties experienced in making arrangements for holidays on a date which is unknown and cannot be announced beforehand, I think it right to put to the War Cabinet thequestion whether the general scheme should not be reconsidered.2. There will no doubt be general agreement with the view expressed byGeneral Eisenhower and Field-Marshal Alexander that the declaration ofVE-Day should be postponed until it is evident that no considerable fighting inEurope still lies before our forces. As Field-Marshal Alexander says, &quot; It wouldbe deplorable if victory celebrations took place whilst lives were being lost in operations to eliminate sizeable pockets of resistance.&quot; Account must also betaken of the effect on the morale and discipline of the troops if public celebrationstake place in this country at a time when arduous and dangerous tasks still liebefore them. In addition there is the risk that celebrations may encourage bothamongst members of the forces and amongst civilians a relaxation of spirit, whichmay have an adverse effect on the conduct of the war in the East.3. There is the difficulty of finding for the celebration of VE-Day a date which will not seem inappropriate because some territory will still be in german occupation. General Eisenhower suggests that one of the conditions to be fulfilledin fixing the date is that &apos;&apos; our forces are in a position to enter Denmark, therebyassuring an early assault on Norway.&quot; Celebrations in this country, however,at a time when Denmark or Norway are still in German occupation may seeminappropriate to the nationals and friends of those countries. Moreover, if theChannel Islands are still in German occupation celebrations will be regarded by many people in this country as premature.4. Having regard to the foregoing considerations the question deserves con-sideration whether it would be right to decide against any official celebrationsover the termination of hostilities in Europe, while at the same time making anearly announcement that on a specified date in the near future there will bearrangements for one or two days&apos; holiday, seeing that such holidays are justified by the state of the w-ar and by the long strain on the civilian workers.5. The original object of arranging for public holidays was to check andto limit the absenteeism which it is anticipated will take place whenever VE-day is declared. If, however, the Government were to announce that there will be no special day declared as VE-Day and to explain the reasons for this, the risk that large numbers of people will stop work on the announcement of VE-day and that many of them may take prolonged holidays, would be eliminated. Inview, however, of the sanction that has been given to the idea that work shallstop on VE-Day and on the succeeding day, it will be necessary for the Govern-ment to arrange some additional public holidays&quot;.6.   Examination of the arrangements to be made for one or two days&apos;holiday shows that many difficulties and much confusion are liable to be caused[29787] .
2unless the date of the holidays can be fixed and announced in advance. If anannouncement can be made say a week or ten days beforehand that holidays willbe arranged on a specified date, most of the difficulties can be overcome, but ifthe Government announce that there will be a general holiday on some date whichis unknown and will not be known till a few hours before the holiday starts,confusion is inevitable.It might conceivably be arranged that the Commanders will let the Govern -ment know, say, a week in advance on what date they propose to declare VE-Day,and for the Government to make an advance public announcement of this date.But such an arrangement necessarily gives an air of unreality to VE-Day, andemphasises the point that it is an arbitrary date which is not related to anydramatic change in the war situation. If there were a sudden and dramaticcollapse of German resistance, general celebrations throughout the country wouldbe natural, but it appears clear that on this occasion there is unlikely to be any event of so dramatic a character as the Armistice of 1918.7. In view of the various conflicting statements made in the newspapers,and the numerous enquiries that are being received from local authorities andother sources as to the arrangements to be made, it would be desirable that apublic statement to clarify the situation should be made at an early date, and i submit that the following questions deserve the consideration of the WarCabinet :  .(a) Should an announcement be made that it is not proposed to declare aparticular day as VE-day, but that additional public holidays willbe given, either at Whitsuntide or possibly by appointing anadditional Bank Holiday early in June 1 This1 is a matter whichprimarily concerns the Minister of Labour, but there will, I imagine,be general agreement that for the purpose of making arrangements as to a public holiday it is desirable to specify a fixed date and to announce that date some time in advance.(b) Should it be announced that while there will be no VE-day and no publiccelebrations of the termination of hostilities in Europe, it is contem-platecl that there will be special thanksgiving services; that the choice of a Sunday for this purpose cannot be settled at present, but thatwhen the Commanders in the Field are able to declare that suchhostilities as may continue in Europe will amount to nothing morethan minor engagements with guerilla bands, it is proposed thatthanksgiving services shall be arranged for the Sunday succeedingthe date of that announcement? There will be no practical difficultyin arranging such thanksgiving services after only two or three days&apos;notice, seeing that plans for such services can be prepared beforehandwhile the date is still unknown.H. M.Home Office. S.W. 1.25th April, 1945.I.From General Eisenhower to the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Repeated to theBritish Chiefs of Staff and Field-Marshal Alexander.   Dated \Ath April, 1945.(EZ. 3744.)(S.C.A.F. 279.)Reference FACS 180.Present evidence indicates that the Germans intend with every means intheir power to prolong resistance to the bitter end in the most inaccessible areasof the continent which their forces now occupy. The possibility of a clear-cutcessation of hostilities may therefore be considered unlikely.2. Areas in which resistance may be continued after the general linking upof our forces with Russian Armies, and for which I am likely to be responsible,include the following widely dispersed localities :  (a) Western Austria or National Redoubt.(b) North German flats.(c) Frisian Islands and Heligoland.(d) Western Holland.
(e) Denmark.(/) Norway.(g) Channel Islands.(h) German pockets in France.3. Although resistance in a number of these areas may not be prolongedit is evident that operations against certain of them, notably Norway and WesternAustria, may involve considerable forces and also may last for some time.4. The declaration of a VE-day will inevitably convey to the people ofthe United States and of the British Commonwealth that the war in europe is over and that such hostilities as may continue will amount to nothing morethan minor engagements with guerilla bands. I believe therefore that in orderto avoid subsequent misunderstandings it is imperative to postpone the declara-tion of VE-day until it is evident that further months of hostilities on a fairlyconsiderable scale do not lie before us. It may well be that morale in the Germanoutposts will crack as soon as the greater part of Germany has been occupied,but this cannot be proved until the event has happened.5. It must be remembered that the storming of the final citadels of Naziresistance may well call for acts of endurance and heroism on the part of theforces engaged comparable to the peak battles of the war, and I believe that a premature declaration of VE-day might well have a serious adverse effect on the morale of the troops engaged which would in turn affect operations.6. My recommendations are that VE-day should not be announced until thefollowing conditions have been fulfilled : (a) Our forces have joined hands with the Russians in central Germany overa fairly wide front.(b) Our forces have occupied the key positions in the so-called NationalRedoubt of Western Austria, thereby preventing long-drawn-oatoperations on a considerable scale.(c) Our forces are in a position to enter Denmark thereby assuring an earlyassault on Norway.7. As to procedure, it is my belief that the declaration of VE-day shouldtake the form of a co-ordinated statement by the Russians, British and UnitedStates Governments, the timing of which should be based on the recommendationsof SA.C.M.E.D. and myself to the Combined Chiefs of Staff.8. I fully appreciate the urgent necessity for the early release of forces from this theatre for the prosecution of the war against Japan and this has,in fact, already begun as we have agreed to the redeployment of a number of units on our troop basis. It will also be possible for us to release progressivelyessential units from this theatre prior to the cessation of hostilities -when theenemy becomes confined to limited areas which I have indicated above. I recom-mend therefore that the initiation of redeployment should bear no fixed timerelationship to the declaration of VE-day but should be timed in accordance withthe progress of operations.II.From Field-Marshal Alexander to the Combined Chiefs of Staff and BritishChiefs of Staff.   Repeated to S.H.A.E.F. (Forward).   Dated lUh April, 1945.(I.Z. 3716.)(N.A.F. 919.)In reply to FAN. 522.I am strongly opposed to any announcement of victory in Europe being made until the whole of Germany, Austria and German-occupied territory has beenoverrun and all organised resistance has ceased. It would be deplorable if victorycelebrations took place whilst lives were being lost in operations to eliminatesizeable pockets of resistance.Resistance by guerilla bands will probably continue for some time after-organised resistance is over, but this need not hold up the victory announcement.
