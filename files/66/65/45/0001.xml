DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT216Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1945./SECRET.Copy No. ; I 7W.P. (45) 295.10th May, 1945.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-GUATEMALAN DISPUTE IN RESPECT OF british honduras.IN his paper W.P. (45) 282 of the 3rd May, 1945, the Secretary of State forthe Colonies gave a brief account of our longstanding dispute with Guatemala inrespect of British Honduras, in connexion with the recent anxiety regardingthe possibility of Guatemalan military action against that colony. Since this dispute affects our relations not only with Guatemala (which are not perhapsvery important), but with ail the countries of the Western Hemisphere, includingthe United States, and since there exists at any rate the possibility that theGuatemalans may succeed in ventilating it at the San Francisco Conference, itis desirable that the War Cabinet should be placed in early possession of theviews of the Foreign Office on the subject.2. Guatemalan propaganda, carried out over a period of years, is believed to have had a large measure of success in convincing Latin American opinionof the merits of the Guatemalan case, with which that opinion would in any event be inclined to sympathise, if only because-a Latin American State must from aLatin American standpoint necessarily be in the right, or must at any rate be supported, in a dispute with a non-American Power. The present intensification of relations between the various American States inside the Pan-Americansystem can only reinforce this tendency, whilst there is already a generalprejudice in the Western Hemisphere against the continued possession in that area of colonial territory by European Powers. Public opinion in the UnitedStates, including the State Department, is favourable to the Guatemalan case,even if only, as the Washington Embassy recently warned us, because such an attitude is likely to be helpful to American political and economic interests in central America.3. These special reasons, in addition to the general reasons which alwaysexist for trying to settle any contentious issues, taken with the circumstance thatwe are approaching an era of conferences, which will give Guatemala, as one ofthe United Nations, the chance of ventilating her grievances before an interested and possibly prejudiced international audience, justify a serious effort to disposefinally of the dispute or at least to take such steps as we can to diminish its power to harm our interests.4. Although in 1941 the then Guatemalan Dictator, General Ubico,formally announced that he was putting Guatemalan claims into cold storagefor the duration of the war, we have never lost sight of the desirability of asettlement and the possibility of our making some new offer to the Guatemalanswas exhaustively considered in 1943. The conclusion was reached, however, thatit was not possible for us to improve on our offer of arbitration, which is referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 of W.P. (45) 282. &quot;The State Departmenthaving displayed an active interest in the matter, it was decided to approachWashington with an eye to securing a better understanding of our case there,and consequently United States backing in resubmitting our arbitration offer to the Guatemalans. The terms of this offer of February 1940, and the explana-tions given to the Guatemalans in expansion of it in March of the same year,are set out in Annex A.Memorandum by the Minister of State.12787- [29875]
5. Early in 1944 the Americans produced some alternative terms ofreference for the Arbitral Tribunal which we had suggested should consider thedispute. These alternative terms, the text of which is quoted in Annex B, were examined in May 1944 by the Law Officers of the Crown who reported that these terms differed little from those originally offered and refused. In the ForeignOffice view, His Majesty&apos;s Governments case is so strong that the acceptanceof the American terms could not, having regard especially to American promisesconcerning the calibre of the President of the Tribunal (who is to be appointedby them) increase any present risk that the eventual arbitral award might involvea cession of territory on our part or, indeed, in any way change the presentsituation to our detriment. It would seem, therefore, that nothing would havebeen lost by acceptance of the American proposal. Indeed, much might havebeen gained. Nevertheless, the Colonial Office felt unable to agree that it shouldbe accepted, and the Americans have therefore been left without any indication of the nature of our views on the subject.6. The present position is that Guatemala, strong in the belief that she ison a good political wicket (all the Western Hemisphere, including the UnitedStates, being on her side), has felt able to state her claims publicly and in theirextreme form, and that she intends, not improbably, to do her best to embarrassus by raising the matter, in season and out of season, at the various international conferences which she and the United Kingdom will be attending in the nearfuture. There can be no question of our accepting any bilateral settlement inthe least likely to satisfy the existing Guatemalan pretensions, and Guatemalawill not accept arbitration on the terms on which we have so far offered it. Thesituation thus reached is damaging our credit with a wide section of inter-national opinion, including that of the United States. What, as the ForeignOffice see it, is needed at the moment, therefore, is a move which will put us ina better position in the eyes of the world, particularly of the United States.To accept the terms proposed by the United States Government would be precisely such a move. If we now announced that we would accept terms ofreference for the arbitration which have been suggested as fair by the UnitedStates Government, we should, without increasing our present liabilities, notonly presumably assure ourselves of indispensable United States support indealing with Guatemala over this question, and improve our standing with western Hemisphere public opinion, but we might oblige the GuatemalanGovernment to think very seriously whether their case is as good as they have succeeded in making out to themselves and to the countries of the western hemisphere. At that stage, if they are not already aware of the weaknesses intheir case, they might well come to realise that such exist, and a way might thus be opened to a settlement out of court, e.g., for cash possibly at a fairly earlyelate.R. L.Foreign Office, 10th May, 1945.ANNEX A (1).Terms of Reference already Offered and Rejected in 1940.(1) Is there still any practicable method by which the original obligationslaid down in Article 7, viz. : &quot; With the object of practically carrying out theviews set forth in the preamble of the present Convention, for improving andperpetuating the friendly relations which at present so happily exist between thetwo high contracting parties, they mutually agree conjointly to use their bestefforts by taking adequate means for establishing the easiest communication(either by means of a cart-road, or employing rivers, or both united, accordingto the opinion of the surveying engineers) between the fittest place on the Atlanticcoast near the settlement of Belize and the capital of Guatemala, whereby thecommerce of England on the one hand and the material prosperity of the Republicon the other cannot fail to be sensibly increased at the same time that the limits of the two countries being now clearly defined, all further encroachments by either party on the territory of the other will be effectually checked and preventedfor the future &apos;&apos; can be effectually carried out ?
(2) If the answer to (1) above is in the negative, whether, and if so to what extent, His Majesty&apos;s Government are responsible for the failure to carry out the mutual obligations under the said Article 7 ?(3) Having regard to any responsibility which may devolve upon HisMajesty&apos;s Government for the failure to carry out the mutual obligations imposed by Article 7, by what method of applying all relevant legal and equitable principlesshall His Majesty&apos;s Government now discharge their obligations under that article ?ANNEX A (2).Cypher telegram to Mr. Leche (Guatemala), No. 28 of 2nd March, 1940.(Important.)Your telegrams Nos. 28 and 35 [of the 12th and 23rcl February : Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty dispute].Since we have no intention whatever of yielding to Guatemalan wish that theterms of reference should be modified so as to empower Tribunal to make anypronouncement regarding the validity of the 1859 Convention, deadlock is inevitably-table if Guatemalan Government insist upon a formula of this character. In no circumstances are we prepared to discuss or to leave to any Tribunal, either directly or indirectly, our title to British Honduras, or the pre-1859 position.In the interests, however, of avoiding a prolongation of the controversy, andin the hope that Guatemalans will relinquish their absurd pretensions, we areprepared to make one last explanation of our attitude, in order to assist them, onthe following lines : You should therefore at once convey the following explanation to the Ministerfor Foreign Affairs (in order to avoid any misunderstanding, it would be prgfer-able to make the communication in writing) : &quot; While His Majesty&apos;s government can in no circumstances admit the direct or indirect discussion of their title toBritish Honduras, or of the pre-1859 position on the further question whether,apart from any suggestion of going back beyond 1859, any claim for cession of territory could arise or be entertained by the Tribunal under the terms ofreference, the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government is as follows : After givingthe most careful consideration to the whole of the relevant circumstances, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have drawn the proposed terms of reference widely tocover all relevant legal and equitable principles. His Majesty&apos;s Government clonot, for themselves, see how any claim for cession of territory could arise in this dispute, or be within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have, however, ho knowledge of how such a claim would, if made, be put.In the circumstances, His Majesty&apos;s Government would dispute the maintain-ability of any such claim, and would urge that it was not open to the tribunal to give effect to it. His Majesty&apos;s Government have, however, no intention of going back on the wide terms of reference which they have already submittedto the Guatemalan Government, and, if the Guatemalan Government are ofopinion that a claim for a cession of territory can and should be brought withinthem on this dispute, it will be for the Guatemalan Government to put it forward at such time and in such manner as they think best, and to seek the ruling of theTribunal upon it. His Majesty&apos;s Government must, however, reserve the fullestliberty to contend that a claim for the cession of territory could not, and shouldnot. be considered by the Tribunal as a proper method, whether in law or equity,of calling upon them to fulfil their obligations, if any. under Article 7.&quot;In any conversations which you may have with the Minister for ForeignAffairs regarding the foregoing communication you should exercise the utmostwee to avoid giving the Guatemalan Government&quot;any opportunity of contendinghereafter that His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared, either expressly or byn?p&apos;icltl0n&apos; t0 a8Tee tnat a cession of territory is a proper or possible methodot fulfilling any outstanding obligation that there may be under Article 7. you should ^incidentally, make it plain that, whilst we shall in due course commentupon the Guatemalan notes of the 3rd February and the 22nd February, weemphatically repudiate the reasons which they adduce for treating the dispute onan entirely new basis.
You should also point out that the foregoing communication is an explaua-tion only, and in no way represents a departure from or weakening of HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s previous attitude. The position is and remains thatafter a most careful consideration of all the circumstances, His Majestv&apos;sGovernment have made a generous offer, with wide terms of reference in orderto reach a settlement. In making the foregoing communication, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have not departed in any way from their previous offer, and fromtheir attitude towards the dispute; equally,&quot; there is no chance that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will make any departure from either in the future.ANNEX B.Terms of Reference suggested by the State Department in 1944.Extract from a Telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington,dated 14:th March.My impression of the attitude of the State Department is that they believeprogress can only be made on lines of agreeing on terms of reference for arbitra-tion mutually acceptable to both parties. A member of my staff enquiredinformally whether the Department would care to set down what, in their opinion,the Guatemalan Government would consider acceptable terms. The state department&apos;s Legal Advisers have suggested the following : (1) Are His Majesty&apos;s Government responsible, and if so to what extent, forthe failure to carry out the mutual obligations embodied in the Anglo-Guatemalan Convention of 1859, and particularly Article 7 thereof?(2) Having regard to any responsibility which may devolve on His Majesty&apos;sGovernment for failure to carry out the mutual obligations imposed by that Convention, in what manner applying all relevant legal and equitable principles, shall His Majesty&apos;s Government now discharge their liability ?2. It will be confirmed from the above that they have tried to keep as closeas possible to the original terms of reference, and there is no mention of a territorial cession. They have omitted paragraph 1 of the original terms becausethey thought it ambiguous. In their opinion their suggested paragraph (1) coverstire point in question.3. In paragraph (2) they have altered the phrase &quot; under that article &quot; to&quot;discharge their liability&quot; in order to permit the Guatemalan Government tointroduce anything they may wish the Tribunal to consider.4. In paragraph (2) &quot;by what method&quot; has been changed to &quot;in what manner &quot; so that the Tribunal could lay down definite terms of settlement insteadof method of settlement.5. The State Department think that even -with the above the GuatemalanGovernment might consider that arguments regarding territorial cession couldnot be introduced, but we feel that the Guatemalan Government might be persuaded to accept these terms if they prove acceptable to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.
