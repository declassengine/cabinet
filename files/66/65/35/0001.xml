THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.W.P. (45) 285.22nd May, 1945.-SECRET.Copy No. war CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL 1945 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.A British Commonwealth meeting, preliminary to the San Francisco Con-ference on World Organisation, was held in London from the 4th to 13th April.The meeting was attended by the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and theUnion of South Africa and by Mr. F. M. Forde, the Deputy Prime Minister,and Dr. H./V. Evatt for Australia. Mr. Vincent Massey was the principalCanadian delegate and the other Dominion High Commissioners in Londonparticipated. The Indian delegates to the San Francisco Conference alsoattended.2.   The sixth session of Parliament opened on the 19th March and closedon the 16th April.  The speech from the Throne was a short one and the principalnproceedings of the session were the voting of supplies for the period up.to theopening of the new Parliament, together with the debating of a resolutionendorsing Canadian participation in the San Francisco Conference.3. The Prime Ministers resolution approving in general the purposes and principles set forth in the Dumbarton Oaks proposals was passed by the Houseof Commons on the 28th March by a vote of 202 to 5. The five opposing voteswere from Independent members from Quebec, carrying little weight, and they received no support from the Bloc Populaire members, who voted for the resolu-tion.. Differences of opinion which emerged in the course of the debate were mainly concerned with the question of Canada&apos;s status as a member of theCommonwealth and of her rights and responsibilities in international affairs;the views of the main Opposition parties on the subject of the Dumbarton Oaksproposals showed little divergence from those of the Government.4. As regards Canada&apos;s voice in international affairs, Government spokesmentook the line that Canada&apos;s position as a &quot; middle Power &quot; should be recognised and that the Commonwealth should not be treated as a political entity. TheC.C.F. Party gave general support to the Government, stressing that the positionof secondary nations should be strengthened. Social Credit members voted forthe resolution, but used the occasion to voice strong disapproval of the DumbartonOaks proposals on economic grounds.5. The date of the General Election has been fixed for the 11th June. the choice of this date, previously selected by the Conservative Government of Ontariofor the Provincial Election, showed that the Prime Minister was anxious toprevent a possible Conservative victory in Ontario from prejudicing Liberalchances in the Federal Election. The Provincial Government, however, afterhotly criticising the Prime Minister&apos;s action as a ruse, frustrated it by advancingthe date of the Ontario Election to the 4th June.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.[29940]b
6. Man-power policy remains a principal subject of party controversy and,in particular, the retirement of Major-Generai Pearkes, Officer Commanding-Pacific Command, was the occasion for the ventilation of party views. Major-General Pearkes has since adopted nomination as a Progressive Conservativecandidate for a federal constituency in British Columbia.7. On the 18th April, the Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie King, announceda reorganisation of the administration and stated that he had accepted the resignation of five of his Ministers, including Mr. T. A. Grerar, Minister of mines and Resources, Mr. J. E. Emichaud, Minister of Transport, and Mr. A. L.MacDonald, Minister of National Defence for Naval Services. Seven new Cabinetappointments include Mr. J. A. Glen as successor to Mr. Crerar, Mr. Paul Martinas Secretary of State and Mr. Douglas Abbott as Minister of National defence for Naval Services. The Prime Minister has also announced the appointmentof fifteen new members of the Senate.8. The longstanding issue of the right of appeal to the Privy Council hasbeen reopened by a Bill introduced in the Quebec Legislature by a Bloc Popuiairemember to amend the Quebec Code of Civil Procedure by abolishing the rightof appeals to the Privy Council on matters relating to Provincial law. A pointof interest in this latest debate has been the definite stand by M. Duplessis, theUnion Nationale Premier of Quebec. Presumably fearing the coming federal government&apos;s encroachment of Provincial rights, he expressed the view thatit would be unconstitutional to bring up the question in the Provincial Legisla-ture when the subject was still under discussion in the federal field.9. An announcement by the British Columbia Security Commission of the steps to be taken to implement the Dominion Governments policy outlined lastyear has brought to the fore again the question of the Japanese in Canada. First,a tribunal is to be set up to consider the loyalty of Japanese-Canadians anddeport those who are considered undesirable. Secondly, the Government is pre-pared to pay the travelling expenses of all those wishing to return to Japanafter the war, and, thirdly, all those who remain in Canada will be encouraged to settle east of the Rockies.Economic.10. Colonel Llewellin and Mr. J. G. Gardiner, the Dominion Minister ofAgriculture, signed agreements in Ottawa on the 3rd April which continue tothe end of 1946 the arrangements for Canada to supply bacon, beef and eggs tothe United Kingdom. Under the new contracts the Ministry of Food have agreedto take ail the Canadian bacon, beef and eggs available for export.11. An agreement was also signed on the 26th April, extending for theperiod the 1st April, 1946, to the 31st March, 1947, the contract under the termsof which Canada supplies the Ministry of Food with 125 million pounds ofcheese a year.Service Activities.12. H.M..C.S. Iroquois (destroyer) in company with three of H.M. destroyersattacked a convoy of four ships with two U-boats and three escorts S.E. ofEgersund on the night 3rd/4th when one enemy ship was torpedoed, one probablytorpedoed and a third left on fire while one enemy minesweeper was damaged.13. On the 6th H.M.C.S. Loch Alvie (frigate) in company with H.M.S.Watchman sank a U-boat off the Isle of Wight when four officers and fourteenratings were taken prisoner.14. H.M.C.S. Esquimau (fleet minesweeper) was torpedoed and sunk onthe 16th by a U-boat in the approaches to Halifax.15. On the 13th H.M.C.S. M.T.B. 797 was slightly damaged in an action with E-boats in the North Sea. During the last half of the month H.M.C. ShipsHaida, Huron and Iroquois (destroyers) formed part of the escort to a convoy from the United Kingdom to North Russia.16. By the 5th of the month the First Canadian Army had extended itshold on the east bank of the Rhine to west of Emmerich, advanced N.W. towardsthe Iti /er Ijssel and further west cleared the &quot;island&quot; between NijmegenAnd Arnhem.
17. During the following week a Canadian column advancing astride theEiver Ems was within twenty-five miles of Emden on the 12th. Further west,a thrust through Almelo took Coevorden and entered a town eight miles fromAssen, during which operation contact was made with airborne forces which hadbeen dropped in the Meppen area a few days before. On the western flank ofthis advance opposition was particularly heavy in the area of Deventer, wherethe enemy was still fighting stubbornly to retain his remaining escape route from western Holland, but this town was eventually taken on the 11th.18. During the third week of April Polish armour and Canadian infantryunder Command of the First Canadian Army operated west of the River Emsand rapidly cleared almost the whole of N.E. Holland. An attack westward intothe rear of the Ijssel defences about Apeldoorn made such good progress that by the 15th both this town and Arnhem had been cleared and by the 16thCanadian armour striking N.W. from the latter town had reached the ZuiderZee. During the remainder of the month First Canadian Army continued itstask of clearing N.E. Holland and also made some progress in the direction ofUtrecht.19. A total of 45 R.C.A.F. Squadrons were operational overseas duringthe month, of which 23 were located in the United Kingdom, 19 on the Continent,1 on Italy and 2 in Burma.20. Heavy bombers of No. 6 R.C.A.F. Group flew 1,509 sorties during Aprilas compared with 2,842 sorties in March. The large decrease in activity was mainly due to the diminishing number of targets available. Squadrons operating in this Group claim 7 enemy aircraft destroyed, 3 probably destroyed and5 damaged.21. Mosquitoes, Sunderlands and Wellingtons of the R.C.A.F. squadrons in Coastal Command flew 253 sorties during April, which compares with 307during the previous month. One aircraft is missing from operations carriedout and during one of these a Wellington of 407 Squadron attacked six midgetsubmarines.22. R.C.A.F. Squadrons in 2nd T.A.F. flew a record number of over7,500 sorties in April as compared with 5,944 flown in March. Squadrons claim57 enemy aircraft destroyed, 2 probably destroyed and 29 damaged, while 20R.C.A.F. aircraft are missing.23. The three squadrons in Fighter Command flew 287 sorties during themonth when 6 enemy aircraft claimed destroyed, 1 probably destroyed and damaged for the loss of 3 aircraft reported missing.24. The R.C.A.F. Dakota Squadrons of Transport Command of which one is located in United Kingdom and two in Burma again increased their numberof sorties with a total of 4,355 in April, which compares with 4,284 flown inMarch, all carried out without loss.25. Beaufighter Squadrons located in United Kingdom and the fighter squadron located in Italy flew 135 sorties and 722 sorties respectively with thelatter losing 1 aircraft during this period.26. Two R.C.A.F. (A.O.P.) Squadrons operated with the Canadian Armyduring the month of April while a third is still in this country awaiting transfer-to the Continent.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.27. Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester paidtheir first visit to Western Australia at the beginning of April, when they were met at Perth by the Lord Mayor. They have followed this visit by a five-daytour of Tasmania, where they were met by the Governor, Sir Ernest Clark, thePremier, Mr. Cosgrove, and the heads of the Services.28. The setting up of a peace-time Council of Defence along similar lines to those of the present Advisory War Council was foreshadowed by the PrimeMinister, Mr. Curtin, who said that he intended to invite Opposition leaders to sit on the Defence Council as they had sat on the Advisory War Council.Opposition co-operation was vital to Australia&apos;s future defence plans as120940]       - b 2
continuity of policy was essential. The creation of such a body would not deprive the political party of their rights but would give them a fuller knowledge of basic defence needs.Economic.29. The Commonwealth adult meat ration was cut by per cent, asfrom the 7th May. (Children are not affected.) There is a similar restriction in supplies to commercial users and a 25 per cent, reduction in supplies torestaurants. These reductions in domestic consumption will, it is estimated,enable Australia to maintain her exports to the United Kingdom, i.e., to offset the effects of the decline in production caused by the recent disastrous drought.30. In announcing these decisions, Mr. Chifiey, the Acting Prime Minister,said that the choice facing Australia was either to reduce her present rate of consumption or to reduce supplies to Britain; to cut exports to Britain in thepresent circumstances would be unthinkable; Australia would never recoil fromthe large claims made on her as a partner of the United Nations; the deeds ofcourage of the British people, civilians as well as servicemen, established thejustness of their claim to share Australian food. The Australian press haswelcomed the decision to reduce Australians ration in order to maintain supplies to the United Kingdom. A typical comment is that it is unthinkable that anyAustralian would begrudge &quot; the tiny weekly quota.&quot;31. Two years of drought have resulted in an acute stock fodder positionin Australia, and this aspect is engaging the serious attention of the Govern-ment. who have appealed for a maximum crop of cereals this year. The droughtitself was, however, broken in many districts in the middle of April.32. It has recently been reported in the press that the Nuffield organisation has formed an Australian company Nuffield Australia Pty. Limited with a capital of  1 million to embark on manufacture in the Dominion. The comjDanywill start with the manufacture of motor vehicle bodies.33. An earlier press report stated that Messrs. Rootes Limited had sub-mitted a proposal for the manufacture of a low7 or medium-priced motor-car inAustralia, and that this proposal was being examined by the secondary industries Commission. Other proposals had come from General Motors-HoldensLimited and the Ford Motor Company.Service A activities.34. On the 27th/28th RAN. Cruiser force, including H.M.A. ShipsWarramunga and Arunta (destroyers), formed part of the force which supported the landing of Australian troops on Tarakan Island off the coast of Borneo.Numbers borne in R.A.N. on the 31st March, 1945, was active list 8,173,reserves 27,333 and W.R.A.N.S. 2,400.35. In the southern part of Bougainville Island during the beginning ofthe month Australian troops were advancing when they were met by two ofthe fiercest Japanese counter-attacks so far encountered during this campaign.The enemy penetrated to the Australian area west of the Puriata River cuttingseveral lines of communication and isolating a number of our positions. Thesituation was re-established by the arrival of tanks which crossed, the river andeffected complete surprise. Previously the swampy ground prevented the useof tanks in this area but, in this instance, they had been taken down the coastby barge and assisted forward by bulldozers and tractors. Enemy casualties in this engagement were heavier than hitherto with 620 Japanese being killed and more than 1,000 wounded.36. Progress was also made in the central sector along the Buin Roadwith the aid of tanks, while in the northern part of the island the SorakenPeninsula has been cleared of the enemy.37. On New Guinea, since the capture in March of the airfields at But andDagua when 140 aircraft and much valuable equipment were taken, australian troops have cleared the whole area surrounding these airfields and are now making progress inland to the northern foothills of the Torricelli Mountains.38. Further north Australian troops, supported by tanks and artillery,have during the month advanced eastward to within 14 miles of Wewak whilealso capturing Maprik, which is 60 miles east of Aitape.
39. On New Britain various plantations have been cleared and enemy positions taken in the Wide Bay area and subsequently active patrolling along the coast and inland indicates that except for occasional sorties the japanese are remaining within their stronghold at the N.E. end of the Gazelle Peninsula.NEW ZEALAND.40. Speeches have referred to the food shortage in the United Kingdom,and the Government has been urged to give a lead to primary producers in NewZealand to give all the help they can.Service Activities.41. During the month of April the 2nd New Zealand Division took partin the offensive operations which were launched in Italy on the 9th. By the 11ththey had secured a small bridgehead over the River Santer.no up to which theAllied line had been advanced during the first 48 hours of the offensive. A UnitedKingdom division was then passed through the New Zealand bridgehead, but after a short respite they were once again forcing a river, this time the Sillaro,which was crossed on the 15th, and by the 19th the Allied line had been advanced to the right bank of the Gaiana.42. During the final stages of this advance which culminated in the surrender of the German forces under Colonel-General Vietinghof, the 2nd NewZealand Division were in the forefront of the advance, and after capturingPadua, crossed the Piave on the 30th and reached Trieste on the following day,where they accepted the surrender of the local German force and linked up withelements of the Yugoslav Army.43. Personnel of the R.N.Z.A.F., as at the 31st March, 1945, numberedin New Zealand, 20,272 men and 2,541 women, while those serving abroad,excluding personnel at disposal of R.A.F., numbered 8,448 men and 67 women.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.44. Dr. N. Diedricks, the Chief Leader of the Reddingsdaadbond, whichis a political economic organisation with many subsidiary companies, in a reporton the progress of the movement, says that the Afrikaners have now got a footingin the furniture industry and control many factories. Their interests extend tothe engineering, clothing,, food, coal, diamond cutting and building industries.The Reddingsdaadbond proposes to raise  100,000 capital for assisting small businesses run by Afrikaners, and it has also established an Afrikaans SharesBureau for marketing the shares of the Afrikaans companies it is possible for board of Directors to refuse to transfer in those cases and so prevent sharesfalling into &quot; undesirable &quot;&apos; hands. The Voikskas, the Afrikaans peoples&apos; bank,proposes to raise its capital from : 623,000 to  1,000,000 by new share issues.45. Far-reaching plans to solve Natal&apos;s racial problems were announced by Mr. D. E. Mitchell, Administrator of Natal. The Government legislation would give Natal power to deal with the housing problem in order to separate the races by natural means. The policy would be to establish separate residentialareas for Europeans, Indians and Natives and vast areas of land would be acquired from Europeans and Indians.46. A Bill to put Native education on a sounder footing has been introduced into the Assembly by the Minister of Education, Mr. Hofmeyr. Infuture, funds will be made available from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, but mr. Hofmeyr stressed that Native education would continue to be administered by the Provinces. There would, however, be created a Union Advisory Boardof Native Education, with the Secretary for Native Affairs as Chairman andthe Union Education Department as the Secretariat.47. The Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Strauss, has announced that1-h. E. J. van Biljen, who has recently studied the rationing scheme in Kenya,has reported against the introduction of rationing in the Union, as there are too many difficulties, the chief of which is insufficiency of man-power to carry out such a scheme.48. It has been announced that sheltered employment projects for disabled ex-volunteers will in time be established in all the major centres of the Union.49. The Minister of Transport, Mr. Sturrock, told the Assembly thatultimately it. was intended to provide a 20-hour air service between South
Africa and Britain, but at the beginning the flight would take about seventyhours. The Union&apos;s permanent airport will be established at Kemptonparkbetween Germiston and. Pretoria, about thirteen miles from the Johannesburg-railway station. The other two airports in the Union will be at Cape Townand Durban. International planes would be allowed to touch down for traffic at only one port in the Union.Service A activities.50. During the latter half of the month the 6th South African armoured division under Command of the Fifth Army took part in the offensive operations in Italy. After the breakthrough had taken place they were directed N.E. onPadua to come in behind the German forces facing the Eighth Army Front.During this thrust they linked up with the 2nd New Zealand Division, justSouth of Padua which was subsequently occupied.51. Thereafter they were directed west and formed part of the force whichlater liberated Milan.EIRE.52. The Interim Agreement and the Convention on International CivilAviation signed at Chicaco on the 7th December, 1944, were approved by the dail on the 19th April. The Minister for Industry and Commerce said thathis Government are willing to negotiate with the countries interested the grantof the necessary freedoms through bilateral agreements, and that the Agreementrecently concluded with the United States exemplifies their policy in that respect.He added that their policy regarding the Shannon airport is to ensure its inclusion in the main transport route and on a basis securing the maximumtraffic at the airport.- . Economic.53. According to a White Paper issued during the month, the Ministerfor Finance will budget for an expenditure of  52,367,000 as against an income,on the basis of present taxation, of  47,995,000, leaving a deficit of  4,372,000.54.   The Exchequer returns for 1944-45 reveal that revenue amounted to 46,175.495 as compared with  43.779,732 in 1943-44. Expenditure totalled 48,520,783 as against  45,009.012 in the previous year. There was a deficit of  2,345,288 as compared with  1,229,280 in 1943-44.55. The gross output of industrial production in 1943 amounted to 110,476,000, as compared with.  89,370,000 in 1938. The &quot;net figures were 41,212,000 and  35,546,000 respectively. The average number employed in1943 was 140,794 as compared with 166,174 in 1938. Complete returns were not taken for the years 1939-42 inclusive.56. In a speech to the Cork Chamber.of Commerce the Minister for Industryand Commerce declared that unemployment could be conquered in Eire, butnot by any policy ready-made from Great Britain or elsewhere. He said thatit was contemplated that after the war the Government would seek powers to supervise the efficiency of industry, to investigate the reasonableness of prices,not in relation to profits earned, but to factors such as the suitability of pro-ductive methods, competence of management and economy of distribution. he added that the Governments aim would be to maintain only such controls as were necessary to ensure that there would be no unnecessary impediments to development, and that facilities required by private enterprise were available.NEWFOUNDLAND.57. For the fifth consecutive year, the Newfoundland Government have beenable to announce a surplus of revenue over expenditure. For the financial year which ended on the 31st March, revenue returns reached the record figure of over$33 million, which, with expenditure of a little more than $26 million, providedfor a surplus for the period 1944-45 of approximately $7 million.58. The Budget for the present year, which has been drawn up, if anything,on a,cautious basis, provides again for a small surplus. A number of reductions in customs duties, designed, to bring down the present high cost of living and toassist the rehabilitation of industry in the immediate post-war period, have been
announced, and it has also been decided, after consultation with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, that the war disability pension payable toNewfoundlanders serving with His Majesty&apos;s forces, which are at present supple-merited to the extent of 60 per cent, by the Commission of Government, shouldhenceforth be further increased to the level of the rates obtaining at the end ofthe 1914-18 War.59. The accumulated surplus balances at present held by the new found land government, including the sum of 112,300,000 which has been lent free of interestto His Majesty&apos;s Government for war purposes, now amount to approximately$25 million, and it is the Commission&apos;s intention that this sum should in the mainbe utilised for the re-establishment of ex-servicemen and for the execution of anumber of post-war reconstruction schemes which have already received theSecretary of State&apos;s approval.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.60. The political event of most interest in April was the publication earlyin the month of the constitutional recommendations of the Sapru &quot; ConciliationCommittee.&quot; How much importance and influence they will have hereafter it isdifficult to say; at the moment it is quite plain that there is no chance of theirobtaining general acceptance. They are on the whole welcomed by moderateHindu opinion, particularly in the rejection of any plan for the division of India;but the more orthodox and extreme Hindu opinion, as represented by the HinduMahasabha, condemns the proposal to give equal representation to Moslems andcaste Hindus in the constitution-making body and (if joint electorates are accepted) in the future Central Legislature and Executive. Moslem opinionsummarily dismisses the recommendations primarily because they find no place for &quot; Pakistan,&quot; also because there is no provision for the non-accession or subse-quent secession of Provinces, and because the concession of equal representation ismade dependent on the surrender of separate electorates. The Moslem Leaguewas, of course, not represented on the Committee. Unfortunately, the Committee&apos;slabours do not at present appear to have brought an Indian settlement any nearer;that the Committee were themselves prepared, for failure is apparent from their final recommendation that, in the event of the parties failing to reach agreement on the proposals, His Majesty&apos;s Government should assume responsibility forframing and imposing the new Constitution.61. In provincial politics there have been signs that some Congress followerswould welcome the return of Congress to office, but no encouragement has comefrom Mr. Gandhi, who may be waiting to see what developments follow LordWavelfs visit to London.Foreign and Frontier Relations.62. San Francisco Conference. As one of the United Nations, India is taking part in the San Francisco Conference. The Indian Delegation, which alsoparticipated in the preliminary Commonwealth discussions in London, consists of Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar (Supply Member of the Viceroy&apos;s ExecutiveCouncil), Sir Firozkhan Noon (Defence Member of the Viceroy&apos;s ExecutiveCouncil), with Sir V. T. Krishnamachari, who was until recently Diwan of BarodaState, representing the interests of the States. Sir Ramaswami Mudaliars speech in plenary session in the opening stages of the Conference is reported to have madea marked impression. He has since been appointed Chairman of the Committeeou Economic and Social Co-operation.63. A slight note of disharmony has been struck by the proceedings ofMrs. Pandit (Nehru&apos;s sister) who is staying at San Francisco and has &quot;been running a publicity campaign with the intention of discrediting the indian delegation. It is doubtful, however, whether she has, so far &quot;at -any rate,achieved any success in this direction.64. America. While Mr. Phillips was in India as Mr. Roosevelt&apos;s personal representative the post of United States Commissioner to India remained vacantiiiul the office was left in the charge of Mr. G. R. Merrell, the Secretary.   On
Mr. Phillips&apos; departure this arrangement was left undisturbed until recently whenwith the agreement of the Government of India the United States Governmentregularised the position by appointing Mr. Merrell United States Commissionerwith the personal rank of Minister.65. France. In recognition of M. Bonvin&apos;s services to the Allied causeas Governor of Pondicherry, the opportunity was taken of his recent recall to paris to award him a K.B.E. (Honorary).66. Afghanistan. The food situation in the provinces has somewhatimproved, and original reports of disturbances appear to have been exaggerated.They are ascribed by local Afghan officials to Soviet agitation. There were signs that the usual summer tribal unrest in the Southern province was shortly to beexpected.67. No regret is expressed for the failure to obtain the right to participate in the San Francisco Conference by declaring war on the Axis; the action takenby Turkey and Egypt in this connexion is thought &quot;undignified&quot; by mostAfghans. The denunciations by the U.S.S.R. of her treaty with Turkey cameas a severe shock to the Afghans and. the Soviet Embassy are being hard put toit to reassure the public as to Russian intentions.68.   The North-West Frontier has on the whole been quiet.69. Sinkiang. A Moslem rebellion, which originated in Kuldja, spreadrapidly in the north-western part of the province. It was everywhere accompaniedby the massacre of resident Chinese. Though, the Chinese allege that the revoltwas instigated by the Russians, the evidence appears at present to be conflicting.Economic.70. Industrialisation of India. The Government of India have issued amimportant statement of their policy regarding the organisation of industrialdevelopment in India after the war. This statement of policy is to some extentprovisional and is subject to consultation with the Provinces and States, which isnow to be undertaken.   Its main points are :  (a) the bringing under Central control by Central legislation of twentyselected industries which are either basic to the economy of India or are industries of strategic importance. This would have the effectof taking these industries out of the Provincial sphere in which they now are;(&amp;) the bringing under State ownership of a few industries or parts ofindustries;(c) the giving of financial assistance by the State to selected industries;(d) the introduction of a licensing system under which no new factoriescan be proceeded with without a licence from the Central Govern-ment in respect of the twenty Centrally controlled industries or fromProvincial Governments or States in respect of other industries.This is designed to secure a satisfactory geographical distribution ofindustry and to prevent industrialisation taking a form which runscounter to what is conceived to be the national interest;(e) protection by tariffs and possibly by import control;(/) the purchase by Government of the products of Indian industry in preference to others;(g) the employment of taxation to assist industrial expansion;(h) the maintenance of control over capital issues in order to secure balancedinvestment as between industry and other purposes and a balanceddevelopment of the various industries.This statement of policy has had a rather mixed reception in India.71. Transportation. Very serious congestion is being experienced on theIndian railway system owing to the increase in traffic connected with operations and the building up of the Indian base. There is special difficulty in railingenough coal to meet the increased demand, even though coal production is steadily increasing as a result of the special measures recently taken to that end.These difficulties are primarily due to a shortage of broad gauge railway wagons and the fact that the large numbers under order for India, both from north america and the United Kingdom, are coming forward much more slowly than was hoped.    Thus, it was hoped to obtain some 29,000 broad gauge wagons
from overseas in 1945, with delivery ex works starting in February andcompleting in December, with a view to all being in service by the end of March1946. Actually, however, not more than 100 were delivered by the end of april and it is now unlikely that even by the end of September more than about 3,000of them will be in service in India. Delivery schedules for 8,000 placed inCanada and 10,000 placed in the United Kingdom are falling down badly, andthe United States have so far refused to accept an order for the last 6,000. Allpossible efforts to improve the situation are being made.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.Royal Indian Navy.72. Coastal Forces with certain elements of the Landing Craft Wing sup-ported by H.M.I. Sloops have been employed in operations on the Arakan Coast.Military.73. Mediterranean. The 8th and 10th Indian Divisions took part in the victorious advance of the 8th Army.74. Burma. The capture of Mandalay and the establishment of a firmline from Meiktila, 76 miles south of the city, to Myingyan on the Irrawaddy,50 miles north-west of Meiktila, provided firm bases for further operations.Thereafter events moved with increasing rapidity. By the 30th April our troops were within 36 miles of Rangoon.75. 15 Corps Front. Taungup was captured, while further north-westslow progress has been made against the Japanese base at An.76. lkth Army. Forward elements of 14th Army have reached a point80 miles south of Meiktila on the road to Rangoon and press reports have announced the capture of Pegu only some 30 miles from the latter. disorganisation-tion has rendered the opposition met less formidable than would otherwise havebeen the case.77. Good progress has also been made in the oilfield area on the east bankof the Irrawaddy and Chauk has been captured.78. The advance eastwards from Thazi into the Shan States has metstubborn resistance in the foothills.Air.79. Flying over 1,000 miles from their bases, heavy bombers of EasternAir Command Strategic Air Forces again attacked Bangkok targets. R.A.F.Liberators destroyed the concrete and brick power-house of the Thai Governmentelectric plant, while U.S.A.A.F. B-24s&apos; very seriously damaged another power-plant. Four days later B-24s attacked Bangkok dock installations and wharfarea with excellent results. Air attacks on bridges, dumps and enemy troopscontinued.General.80. Medical. Operational spraying of DDT began on the 27th March.Three square miles of Akyab Island were covered by one Liberator aircraft onthe first two days.81. Morale. Morale remains uniformly high. The progress of repatriationand leave schemes continues to give satisfaction but certain elements considerthat the shipping effort expended on the leave schemes might have been betteremployed in reducing still further the period of three years ten months at whichrepatriation is now taking place.82.

(I) to United Kingdom (February 1945) are : Surface     ...............      47 days.Air Mail...............      10    ,,Airgraphs ...       ...      ...       ...       ...       1184. Canteens. The beer issue was to be increased from three to five bottlesa month from May 1945.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Enemy-Occupied Burma.85. As the situation becomes more serious, Ba Maw&apos;s Government continuesto attempt to rally Burmese opinion by putting out propaganda about allegedAllied atrocities and particularly the destruction of religious buildings. This,however, appears to be having little effect, and increasing evidence of Burmesesupport for the Allies is forthcoming. During the first half of March a largenumber of troops of the &quot;Burma National Army&quot; officers and men surrender-dered in the Sagaing region and offered their help to clear the Japanese from thearea. Units of the B.N.A. are now reported to be fighting against the Japanesein certain districts.Liberated Burma.86. The attitude of the people to the Allied troops continues to be friendly,no reports of hostility having been received except from extremist politicians inAkyab, whose attitude is greatly adding to the difficulties of administration. Inthis area the police strength has had to be increased; other areas are fairly quiet,though many dacoities (armed robberies) are reported in some districts and largehauls of illicit firearms are being made by the police in all districts.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners and.  the British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.Ceylon.87. My report for last month referred to the approach which was beingmade to the United States authorities for the release of rice to Ceylon. I nowunderstand that the United States, because of their own heavy commitments, areunable to render any assistance to the Island.88. The seriousness of Ceylon&apos;s position arising from failure to maintainadequate rice supplies cannot be too strongly emphasised. Any cut in the riceration would inevitably result in a reduction in rubber and tea production.89. The matter is under continuous consideration by the Departments con-cerned, and the Ministry of Food is exploring with the greatest energy all possible means of meeting Ceyloifs rice requirements.90. Arrangements have been made to ship additional quantities of 110111&apos;and wheat from the Argentine and/or North America to Ceylon to ensure thatthe monthly requirement of 36,500 tons total cereals will be covered.General Prospects of Supplies to the Colonies.91. Colonial Governments have been warned against any undue optimismwith regard to improvement of the supply position after the cessation of hostilities in Europe, and have been informed that, at any rate as regards the principal
consumer goods, no improvement can be expected during the first twelve months,having regard to the continued difficulties of production, the demands which will arise to meet the urgent needs of liberated territories, and the continued acuteshipping shortage which is likely to prevail until fighting in the Far East alsois over.Nigeria.92. Early in April the Governor of Nigeria reported that, as the resultof a labour dispute, production at the Government-owned colliery at Enuguhad ceased. As all four British West African territories are entirely dependenton the Enugu colliery for coal supplies, the situation was obviously extremely serious. In addition, the French West African territories also depend on this source. It was estimated that existing stocks would not last for more than eight weeks, and that at least KhOOO tons a week would be required from outsideWest Africa in order to maintain normal services, including, in particular, theevacuation of produce required for the United Kingdom. In view of the generalworld coal shortage it would obviously have been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to meet this demand, but fortunately the Governor was able to reportthat production had been resumed at the colliery, though at a reduced rate. Itis not anticipated that the full production rate will be restored before October,but, if there is no further set-back, it is unlikely that assistance will be required from outside.Defence.93. A leave and repatriation scheme for West and East African troopsin India and South-East Asia Command has now been approved. Under thisscheme African troops will return to West and East Africa after approximately2\ to 3 years of overseas service, subject to shipping being available.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.94. After initial optimism there is now some disappointment among theArabs that the Arab League has not yet taken any practical measures to assistdie Arab cause in Palestine.95. Jewish activities continued to be centred on the San Francisco Con-ference, although there was an increasing doubt among the Jews whetherPalestine would be discussed there. Mr. Ben Gurion, the Chairman of theJewish Agency Executive, followed Dr. Weizmann to England, but both havebeen unwell since their arrival. Mr. Kaplan, the Treasurer of the Agency, has gone to the United States.96. There was no terrorist activity during the month and no kidnapping-Look place. The police continued active anti-terrorist measures and twenty-sevenpersons were detained.97. The proposal that the Mayoralty of Jerusalem should be solved by ascheme of rotation whereby a Moslem, Jew and Christian should each be Mayorfor one year in turn, continues to engage attention among both Arabs and Jews,but the final reaction of the Moslem Councillors to these proposals is still awaited.98. The Arabian-American Oil Company, a subsidiary of the Standard oil company of California, have applied for facilities for the construction of an oil pipeline from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean coast of Palestine.The United States Government have expressed a benevolent interest, whilstpointing out that the proposal is a purely business one. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have informed the United States Government that they approve inprinciple the construction of the pipeline, and that they would wish to be consulted as to its route and terminal in view of their responsibilities under thePalestine and Transjordan Mandates. The company wish the pipeline to follow the shortest convenient route through Saudi Arabia, Transjordan and Palestine,but have not yet made up their minds as to its exact course nor as to the terminal,though it will probably be in the neighbourhood of Haifa. Negotiations arenow proceeding for the conclusion of Conventions with the Company on the linesox the Conventions between the Governments of Palestine and Transjordan andthe Iraq Petroleum Company in connexion with the latter company&apos;s pipeline.
Ceylon.99. The Commission on Constitutional Reform, of which Lord Soulburyis chairman, returned to this country, on the 9th April and is now preparingits report, which it hopes to submit within the next few weeks.100. Mr. G. C. S. Corea, the Minister for Labour, Industry and Commerce,arrived in the United Kingdom on the 6th May for certain commoditydiscussions.Mauritius.101. Professor H. J. Seddon, Nuffield Professor of Orthopaedics, at OxfordUniversity, with a research specialist and a masseuse, arrived in Mauritius onthe 15th April to render assistance in connexion with the serious outbreak ofinfantile paralysis in the colony.102. At the beginning of April a cyclone struck Mauritius for the thirdtime this year causing further severe damage to sugar-cane and food-stuffs.Malta.103. Sir Wilfrid Woods, a former member of the Commission of Govern -ment of Newfoundland, and previously Financial Secretary of Ceylon, has beenappointed as Financial Adviser to consider the financial problems arising inconnexion with the restoration of responsible Government in Malta.Cyprus.104.
