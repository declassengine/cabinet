(45) 260.19  A April, 1945.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED GIFT OF A LIGHT FLEET CARRIER AND two cruisers TO AUSTRALIA.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.IN May last the Prime Minister sent to Mr. Curtin a Memorandum by theFirst Sea Lord offering to turn over to Australia an Aircraft Carrier and one ormore Cruisers. The Australian Prime Minister, in his telegram No. 40 of the14th February, 1945, to the Prime Minister (copy annexed), has now askedwhether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to transfer to the royal australian Navy, without payment, one or two Cruisers of the Tiger class and aLight Fleet Carrier of the Colossus class.2. I welcome the offer of the Australian Government to take over these vessels, since this would ease the Royal Navy&apos;s manning problem, especiallyduring the difficult period which will follow the end of the German war. Inaddition, it would provide a foundation of modern vessels on which to base thepost-war Australian Fleet, at the same time encouraging the development of australian Naval aviation. Moreover, on a long-term view, it would havefinancial advantages, since the maintenance of the vessels would become an australian liability,3. The Light Fleet Carrier Ocean is due to complete in July 1945 and canbe made available for the Royal Australian Navy. The next Tiger class Cruisersare not expected to complete until late 1946 or 1947, respectively. As the royal australian Navy crews may be available much earlier than the Tiger classCruisers, I propose that the Australian Government should be asked to take overtemporarily two fully modernised 6-inch Cruisers, which will be replaced by two ships of the Tiger class when available. Alternatively, one modernised 6-inch cruiser and one Tiger class Cruiser might be transferred in the first place.4. I would propose to stipulate that any vessels transferred shall operate under the operational orders of the Commander-in-Chief, British Pacific Fleet,until the end of the war against Japan.5. Mr. Curtin&apos;s request that the ships should be handed over free of chargeraises a question of some delicacy. Australia has accumulated considerableSterling balances in the course of the war and the Australian authorities seem likely to insist on payment of nearly 100 per cent, of the cost of the services whichthey are undertaking on behalf of the Royal Navy. The capital items alone sofar contemplated for which the Australians claim to be repaid are estimated to total approximately  14 million. In equity, therefore, there is a substantialcase for seeking reimbursement in some form or other for the ships whose valuemay be as much as  9 million, depending on which cruisers are transferred. Onthe whole I suggest that the best method of handling the financial side of the transaction would be to make a free gift of the ships, as requested, and to couplethis with a discreet indication that if the Commonwealth Government were to[29755]
make no charge, or a suitably reduced charge, for the naval facilities being provided for the Royal Navy in Australia, their gesture would be warmlyappreciated.6.   I accordingly seek (a) approval to transfer the ships to the Royal Australian Navy, subject tothe alternatives and conditions set out in paragraph 3 above;(b) guidance on the financial issues mentioned in paragraph 5.A decision is now a matter of urgency because, until a firm offer has beenmade and accepted, the Commonwealth Government are unlikely to approve the recruitment of the additional naval personnel on which the manning of the ships will depend.A. V. A.Admiralty, S.W. 1,19th April, 1945.ANNEX.Australian Government to Dominions Office. Dated I4:th February, 1945.(Received 14th February, 1945.)(No. 40.   Top Secret and Personal.)FOLLOWING for Prime Minister from Prime Minister : War Cabinet has recently completed one of its periodical reviews of australian war effort. As commitments which we have accepted still exceed ourman-power resources we have not yet been able to attain that degree of balancewhich, as I mentioned in London, it is our aim to establish.Two important considerations have retarded the easing of position. In caseof ? Army the operations instructions issued by General MacArthur for occu-pancy of Australian and British islands by Australian forces have entailed anadditional overseas commitment of approximately 10,000 personnel, and havenot permitted the disbandment of many units previously contemplated. In regardto civil economy, War Cabinet has approved of programmes for Royal Navytotalling  26,186,100. In view of my offer of fullest co-operation in basingBritish Fleet in Pacific this was obligation we were glad to undertake.Request that Australian forces should assume responsibility for continuedneutralisation of Japanese in Australian and British territory and mandateswas made to me by General MacArthur on my return from abroad. This enabledhim to withdraw whole of American forces from these islands for his offensivecampaign against Philippines. General MacArthur also asked that two A.I.F.Divisions be made available for. use in his plans for offensive action in S.W.P.A.,and this was agreed to.   These Divisions are now being staged in forward areas.Our land forces have not been very active in last six months though their role has been in accord with plans General MacArthur. Seventeen squadrons ofR.A.A.F. are operating outside Australia in S.W.P.A. and eleven R.A.A.F.squadrons are based on Darwin for operation in North-Western area. Remainingstrength of 21 squadrons is disposed throughout remainder Australia on coastalpatrols and other duties. R.A.N. has been participating actively in general macarthur&apos;s advance on Philippines and H.M.A.S. Australia has been twiceseverely damaged by suicide bombers. It is estimated that she will take several months to repair. You will recall that we previously lost Canberra, which you sograciously replaced with Shropshire, as well as Sydney and Perth, in additionto smaller ships. Hobart, which was torpedoed, has just returned to sea after several months in dock.In making its review, War Cabinet had before it your letter of 27th Mayand First Sea Lord&apos;s memorandum of 26th May, in which you referred to admirality being most willing to turn over to Australia an aircraft carrier andone or more cruisers. Decision on this matter had been deferred after my returnuntil possibility of manning these ships could be more accurately determined atlater review.
War Cabinet has now decided that increase in Australian naval strength is one of most effective ways in which we can maintain satisfactory fighting-effort in advance against Japan. In considering man-power allocations for services it is willing double naval intake and provide monthly quota of 600 menand 100 women for six months ending June 1945, when next periodical man7power review will be held.In these circumstances Government would be pleased to know whether your government would be prepared transfer to R.A.N. without payment one or two cruisers of Tiger class and light fleet carrier of Colossus class as mentioned in first Sea Lord&apos;s memorandum.Government view this not only as means of strengthening R.A.N. squadronfor future operations in this war but also as mentioned by First Sea Lord as wayof providing foundation of modern ships on which to build up Australia&apos;s post-war fleet. It will no doubt be aim of Governments concerned to revive schemeof Empire Naval Defence in Eastern hemisphere, of which R.A.N. was estab-lished as component part.Although manning of these ships would impose very considerable strain upon our already depleted man-power resources, we would be prepared to face thisboth as means of contributing to general man-power problem of providing neces-sary naval forces for defeat of Japan and at same time securing future of R.A.N.You will also be aware that we have 3,000 Australian naval personnel manningships of Royal Navy and that Australian Government has not pressed its originalrequest in my letter of 17th May, 1944, for their return to R.A.N. in order to ease general man-power position.Details of taking over and dates for manning any ships which BritishGovernment would be prepared to transfer to R.A.N. could be left for arrange-ment between Admiralty and Australian Commonwealth Naval Board.
