HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 266*20th A pril, 1945.WAR CABINET.PRODUCTION AGREEMENTS, BULK ORDERS AND ERECTIONOE  HOUSES.Memorandum by the Minister of Works.1. The White Paper on Housing (cmd.. 6609) stated in paragraph 15 thatthe most promising of the new types of prefabricated house construction wouldbe put into large-scale production as soon as practicable. It also stated in para-graphs 23 and 24 that arrangements were being made to ensure production ofmaterials and fitments for the housing programme and to enable manufacturers toput. standard articles into production without waiting for specific orders.Paragraph 24 states that manufacturers will be assured, if necessary by theGovernment, of a market for their products.2. I have established machinery for securing these objects, and, while I am not yet in a position to say the extent.to which Government orders will need tobe placed or production agreements made, it is clear that powers should be avail-able for these purposes. In particular, I shall have to make direct arrangementsfor the production of prefabricated permanent houses and I shall have to givedirect Government orders for Swedish or other imported houses. I am advised that, in view of the fact that housing is so closely controlled by legislation, it isnecessary for me to obtain special legislative powers to carry out these functions and to act, where necessary, as agent for Local Authorities in the erection ofpermanent houses. I have accordingly been invited by the Housing Committee(H. (45) 11th Meeting) to submit proposals to the War Cabinet as soon aspossible.3. I attach a note setting out the principal heads which might be incor-porated in a Bill. It may be necessary to exercise some of these powers,particularly in relation to the Swedish and other complete houses, at a very earlydate. I therefore ask for the approval of the War Cabinet to introduce legislationwith a view to its passage during the present Session.D. S.Ministry of Works, S.W.1,20th April, 1945.Heads of a Bill to Provide for the Making of Production Agreements andthe Purchase and Resale by the Ministry of Works of HouseComponents and for the Erection of Houses by the Ministry ofWorks.1.
