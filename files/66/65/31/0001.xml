3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAIN&apos; ;IC i,lAJE&quot;TY&apos;G GOAHJHNiiENT) 130S^E G R E Tjgp MAY,  1 9h5 COPY NO.^___-WAR cabinet war criminals memorandum by the Lord. chancellor. A telegram just received from the United AingdomDelegation to San Francisco makes it most urgent that cabinet authority should be given for a reply which is asked for today.      The telegram is Annex A.  to this note.2.      i- At their meeting en the^; 12th April the War cabinet considered my Memorandum (W. P. (h5) 225) reporting theresults of discussions which I had had with Judge Rosenmanabout the methods to be adopted in dealing with war criminals (W. M. (h-5) h-3rd Conclusions).      The War cabinet agreed with the American view that the proposal for atreaty creating an inter-allied Criminal Court for the trial of war criminals should be rejected.    It also agreedthat the appropriate tribunal would be a military tribunal.As regards the major criminals, the Cabinet was not infavour of some form of judicial trial.      By Minute 2,Conclusion (2)  the War Cabinet agreed that a statement should be prepared for transmission to the United states authorities,   of the objections, as developed in thediscussion,  to any formal procedure for trial or judicialinquiry into the misdeeds of the principal Nazi leaders,and by Conclusion (3)  I was invited to communicate these conclusions to Judge Rosenman, and to prepare for transmission to the United States authorities thesta.teme nt menti oned in Conclusion ( 2).

3. The general conclusions&apos; of. trie War Cabinet were communicated to Judge Rosenman before his departure tothe United States.      The statement mentioned inConclusion (2)  above was in course of preparation whenit became known that M.  Molotov was going to San Franciscoand that the Foreign Office now thought that the subjectof war criminals might be raised there.      Sir alexander cadogan was just leaving for San Francisco and felt itwas urgent to take&quot;with hinv a paper which I prepared withthe assistance of the Attorney General, at short notice,setting out His Majesty&apos;s Government1s objections to dealing with the arch-criminals by judicial process.This paper is circulated as Annex B.L. On 23rd April the Lord Chancellor received fromSir Alexander Cadogan the telegram (Annex C).      From this it appears that  there is a fundamental difference of view between ourselves, who advocate summary execution onidentification,  and the Americans and Russians;  who insist on some kind of judicial process for major criminals,  so-far as they fail into Allied hands.5. The United Kingdom Delegation at San Francisconow asks urgently to be informed what is the line whichthey are authorised by the Cabinet to take in thediscussion which Mr.  Stettinius has arranged for this afternoon when M. Molotov and the Foreign Secretary willbe present.      Our delegation has,  of course,  in its handsthe paper which    Sir Alexander Cadogan took out.   (Annex B).6. To save time, 1 have drafted a possible reply(Annex D)  and ask that the War Cabinet should consider and decide.whether its despatch can be authorised,   or whether some different instructions should be substituted.      Theextreme urgency of the matter &quot;is obvious.S.house of Lords,  3.W.1.,3rd May,   \&apos;9U5.

The Argument for Sura-gar:/ process against Hitler &amp;Qo,la II.M,G.  assume that it is beyond question that hitler ancl a number of arch-crihiihals associated withhim (including Mussolini) must,  so far as they fall intoAllied hands.?  suffer the penalty of death for their conduct leading up to the v/ar and for the wickednesswhich they have either themselves perpetrated or have authorised in the conduct of the war.      It would hemanifestly impossible to punish war criminals of a lower grade by a capital sentence pronounced by a MilitaryCourt unless the ringleaders are dealt with with equalseverity.      This is really involved in the concludingsentence of the Moscow Declaration on this subject, whichreserves for the arhh-criminals whose offences have no special localisation treatment to he determined in due course by the Allies.2, It being conceded that these leaders must  sufferdeath, the question arises whether they should he tried by some form of tribunal claiming to exercise judicial functions,  or whether the decision taken by the allies should he reached and enforced without the machinery of atrial,      H.M. G. theroughly appreciate the arguments which have been advanced in favour of some form of preliminary trial.      But H.M.G.  are also deeplyimpressed with the dangers and difficulties of thiscourse, and they wish to put before their principalAllies,  in a connected form, the arguments which have led them to think that execution without trial is thepreferable course,.3. The central consideration for deciding^this difficult choice must,  in H,M.G&apos;s view, &quot;be reached by

asking - what is the real charge which Allied people andthe world as a whole make against Hitler?      It is thetotality of his offences against the internationalstandard which civilised countries try to observe which makes him the guilty man that he is.      If he were to beindicted for these offences in the manner that isnecessary for reasons of justice in a criminal court,and if his fate it to be determined on the conclusion reached by the tribunal as to the truth of this bundleof charges and the adequacy of the proof, it seemsimpossible to conceive that the trial would not be exceedingly long and elaborate.      He, of course, must have in such a trial all the rights properly conceded to anaccused person.      He must be defended,  if he wishes, by counsel,  and he must be allowed to call any relevantevidence.      According to British ideas,  at any rate,his defence could not be forcibly shut cloven or limitedbecause it involves a great expenditure of time.There is nothing upon which British opinion is moresensitive in the realm of criminal procedure than the suspicion that an accused person on trial - whatever the depths of his crime - has been denied his fulldefence.1+. There is a further consideration which, in theview of H.M.G.   needs to be very carefully weighed.      Ifthe method of public trial were adopted,  the commentmust be expected from the very start to he that the wholething is a &quot;put-up job&quot; designed by the Allies to justify a punishment they have already resolved on.      Hitler andhis advisers - if they decide to take -part and to challenge what is alleged - may be expected to be very

much alive to any opportunity of turning the tables.Public opinion as the trial goes on is likely to wearyat the length of the process.    It is difficult to thinkthat anybody would, in the course of time look on Hitleras an injured man, but it is by no means unlikely thata long trial will result in a change of public feeling asto the justification of trying Hitler at all.      Will notsome people begin to say&apos;&quot;The man should be shot out of hand&quot;?     And if in the complicated and novel procedure which such a trial is hound to adopt - for Russian, american and British ideas must in some way he amalgamated - thedefence secured some unexpected point,  is there not a danger of the trial being denounced as a farce?5. There is a further point.    Reference has been madeabove to Hitler&apos;  s conduct leading up to the war as oneof the crimes on which the Allies would rely.      Thereshould be included in this the unprovoked attacks which,since the original declaration of war,  he has made on various countries.      These are not war crimes in theordinary sense,  nor is it at  all clear that they can properly be described as crimes under international law.These would, however, necessarily have to he part of thecharge and if the tribunal had - as presumably they woeildhave - to proceed according to international law,  an argument, which might be a formidable argument, would beopen, to the accused that this part of the  indictment  shouldhe struck out.      It may well he thought by some that theseacts ought to be regarded as crimes under international law.

Under the procedure of trial this would he a matter forthe tribunal, and would, at any rate give the accused theopportunity of basing arguments on what has happened inthe past and what has been done by various countries indeclaring war which resulted in acquiring new territory,which certainly were not recorded, at the time as crimesagainst international law.  ,6. Ii.i/[.G.  earnestly hope that their Allies will consider the arguments set out above for they are    most anxious that a very early agreement should be reached as to the method of dealing with Hitler and his chiefassociates, and that the method should be one in whichthe principal Allies concur.      It would in any case be valuable, if a document could now be drawn up giving thereasoned basic for the punishment of the men concerned.It may be worth consideration whether such a documentoould not he served upon each of these men (the listwill have to be agreed) as soon as possible after hiscapture.      He should then be told that if he wishes tomake any answer he must do so in writing within,  say,14 days,  and that his answer will be submitted to theGovernment in whose charge he was,  and that the principalAllies would thereafter promulgate their decision upon his case.      This suggested, procedure would not be, of course,in the nature of a trial and. would not involve the attemptto set up a judicial tribunal, &quot;but it would give the accused the opportunity ef putting forward what he wishedtc say, and night conceivably,  in seme cases, influence the decision.S.16th April,  1945.

/CYPHER/ PR  I P 5 RFROM WASHINGTON TO FOREIGN OFFICEEarl of Halifax D.    h.52 p.m. April 22nd5  19U5-R.   12.50 a.m. April 23rd,  19h7.No.  279M-April 22nd, 19h7-IMPORTANTFollowing from Sir A.  Cadogan for the Lord Chancellor.Your letter of April 1.6th.I Have given your paper to Judge Rosenman, minus the last three sentences,  as I was not sure that this suggestion, whichI understood had not yet been considered by the Cabinet,  shouldbe put to him.2.      Judge Rosenvnan told me that he had now discussed thisquestion with the president and had found him strongly of theopinion that there must be some form of judicial process andthat we could not dispose of major- criminals by political decision.It would therefore seem useless to put to the Americans thesuggestion referred to in paragraph 1  above.3.      It seems therefore that there is a fundamental difference ofview between ourselves who advocate summary execution onidentification and the Americans and Russians who insist on some kind of judicial process.hi      Judge Rosemnan said he thought the United States government might accept &quot;arr dgnmeht&quot; procedure if it were sufficiently&quot;dressed up&quot; whereby I understand him to mean that there wouldhave to be proper provision for verification of documents,  etc,5.      He urged that  in any case it would be desirable  for eachof us to nominate at once representatives who could get together as soon as possible to draft an &quot;arraignment&quot; for use in one way or another and who could also prepare material for giving effect to- the proposal for dealing with &quot;intermediate&quot; class of

criminals mentioned in p&amp;paragraph 3 of your paperV7.P.(us)  225-      Would you &quot;be prepared to do this andwould the Cabinet reconsider the situation in thelight of President Truman&apos;s insistence on judicialprocess in some form?6.      Judge Eosenraan is quite prepared to come toSan Francisco to complete discussions if that should prove necessary.

DRAFT TELEGRAM TO UK DELEGATION AT- SAN FRANCISCOMOST^IMMEDIATEHI UK. DELEGATION&apos; SAN FRANCISCO TELE GRAM TO FOREIGN OFFICE \NO.  101.1.      Sir Alexander Cadogari was given -paper setting out reasons whyCabinet strongly -preferred summary execution on identification ofprincipal war criminals such as Hitler, Himmler,  etc., to any formof judicial or quasi-judicial process.   - This is still the vie?/held by the Cabinet who are not disposed to favour an intermediatecourse involving a document of Arraignment such as had beensuggested by the Lord Chancellor, to which the major criminalmight be invited to present his defence before a judicial body.3.      Cabinet would desire you to present and press the view expressed above in favour of summary execution.      Our information,however,  goes to show that the opposite view is held by president truman and the Soviet Government.      We suggest,  therefore,  thatif there is no prospect of getting agreement with our proposal,you should emphasise the practical difficulties and dangers whichwe fear may arise from staging a trial and should inviteStettinius to get a document drawn up which would formulate the .charges and indicate how &quot;they would be proved,  and how it wouldbe proposed to constitute the tribunal and to provide for therights of defence.5.      One consideration which has influenced us is that the realcase against the major criminals is not limited to atrocitiesperpetrated during the war but  ought to include the systematicpolicy from the beginning of the Nazi regime of the persecutionand extermination of Jews and the forcing of compliance with their plan by the use of concentration camps like Buchenwald.

4.      As regards ordinary war criminals &quot;the conclusions ofthe War Cabinet reached and recorded on 12th April(W.M.(45) 43rd Meeting)  still stand.      We agree with the-United States in rejecting the proposal for a treatycreating an inter-allied criminal court.      We further agreethat the appropriate tribunal for trying such war criminalswould be a military tribunal.      Where the accused is chargedwith offences against victims of different countries a jointmilitary tribunal would seem best.      A joint militarytribunal would also be needed if the country where the crimewas committed during hostile occupation does not wish to try and punish the criminal in its own courts.      Tne warCabinet were disposed to favour the suggestion that leaders and active members of the Gestapo or the .S.S., might come befa   &apos; mixed      military tribunal which would find that membersof those Organ! sat ions had  joined, in a common enterprise ofa criminal character aimed at Promoting Razi supremacy Dy-methods of outrage,  torture,  etc.      The practical method ofgiving effect to this scheme of charging a criminalconspiracy will, however,  require most careful -working outif an intolerable burden is not to be placed on theauthorities responsible for the administration of Germany.
