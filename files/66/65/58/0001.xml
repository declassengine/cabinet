HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 308.lQth May, 1945.WAR CABINET.FUTURE OF BRITISH COAL MINING.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.THERE is little need to argue the importance of re-establishing the british coal-mining industry, on which so many of our other industries, particularly ironand steel, depend. As the Reid Report has shown, the industry, taken as a whole,is not efficient. Recruitment is unsatisfactory, both in numbers and in quality;labour relations remain poor; output per man shift is far too low and the cost ofproduction uneconomically high.2. There is already general concern at the condition of the industry.Although the question of ownership must clearly be left to the electorate at theforthcoming General Election I consider that Parliament and the country willexpect me, in the Debate promised for the 29th May, to state what steps theGovernment propose to take following the Reid Report. I suggest that it wouldbe greatly to the public interest if the present Government were to accept the basic recommendations of that Report, i.e., that there shall be a NationalAuthority endowed by Parliament with really effective powers to ensure (i) themerging of the industry into units of such sizes as would provide the maximumadvantages of planned production, and the conservation of our coal resources inthe national interest, and (ii) the efficient working of the coal-fields by these units.3. The proposals of the Reid Committee have received support in almost every quarter. Indeed, the arguments advanced in paragraphs 752-758 of theReid Report (see Annex) in favour of the establishment of a National authority on the lines indicated above appear to me irresistible if a serious endeavour is to bemade forthwith to regain lost ground, reduce substantially the costs of productionand recapture our export trade in coal.4. In October 1943 the Prime Minister gave the House of Commons an assurance that the present system of control would continue until Parliament had decided on the future structure of the industry, either by agreement between thegreat parties or by the verdict of the electorate.5. Acceptance of the need for a National Authority with powers such asthose outlined in paragraph 2 would in no way prejudice the free choice of the electorate in the question of ownership. It would, however, show that all parties were resolved to restore as soon as possible the efficiency of the British coal-miningindustry.G. Ll. G.Ministry of Fuel and Power. S.W. 1.16th May, 1945.ANNEX.Extract from the Report of the Technical Advisory Committee on Coal Mining,Cmd. 6610.752.   There are mines on the point of exhausting their reserves; mines whichshould be closed clown altogether and their reserves worked from adjoining-collieries;   mines where  the remaining  reserves  can,  under  no  scheme  of[29905]
reconstruction, be worked profitably; mines between which valuable coal has beensterilised to form barriers; and mines which, for a period of their reconstruction,will have to be completely closed down.753. There are undertakings which have a lease of coal that could be workedto better advantage by another undertaking; and undertakings whose mines arewidely spread through a district, and even among several districts.754. There are new sinkings required where the reserves which should be worked from them are leased to two or more undertakings; and new sinkingswhere, by reason of the depth to be reached, so long a view has to be taken andsuch heavy interest payments incurred, that the cost of the shafts, plant anddevelopment is likely to be beyond the resources of the undertaking owning the leasehold.755. There are surface plants to be erected which should serve a number of mines, which may be under different ownership.756. There are districts where the reconstruction of certain mines wouldenable the output required to be maintained, leaving, for the time being at least,no place for the remaining mines in these districts.757. There are many other spheres also, including systematic research intomethods of Avork, and a wide range of problems from mines drainage to thetraining of the personnel of the Industry, in Avhich combined action upon abroad basis presents the only satisfactory solution.758. Unfortunately, there is a serious dearth of mining engineers whopossess the knoA\dedge and experience necessary to undertake the far-reachingschemes of reorganisation Avhich are essential. The services of those who are soqualified will consequently be required for the Avider benefit of the Industry.
