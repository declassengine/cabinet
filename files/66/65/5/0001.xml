THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 255.16 A April, 1945.WAR CABINET.RELEASE OF CANDIDATES FOR PARLIAMENT FROMHIS MAJESTY&apos;S FORCES.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.AT the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 29th January (W.M. (45)12th Conclusions, Minute 5) it was decided to consider again in a few weeks the question of the date at which candidates who have been adopted for theGeneral Election should be temporarily released from the Forces. I accordinglysubmit the following proposals for consideration.2. Adopted candidates should be free to go to their constituencies as soon aspracticable after the date of the dissolution of Parliament has been announced.This will be at least 38 days before polling day. Candidates who do not wishto be set free from military duty immediately the dissolution has been announcedmay elect to be set free at a later date between then and nomination day.3. As regards the period of release, a complication is caused by the postalvoting arrangements for the Forces which will delay the declaration of the pollfor some time after polling day. As their political activity cannot be regardedas ended until the result of the Election is known, I consider that all candidatesshould remain on release until the declaration of the poll.4. Candidates who are in Civil Defence or civilian employment shouldpresumably be released at the same time as candidates in His Majesty&apos;s Forces.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S. W. 1,April, 1945.[29729]
