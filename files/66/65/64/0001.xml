HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET. /        Copy NoW.P. (45) 314.18th May, 1945.WAR CABINET.RELEASE AND RECONVERSION OF FISHING TRAWLERS.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.IN accordance with the Conclusion on Item 5 of the Meeting of the WarCabinet on Monday, the 14th May (W.M. (45) 61st Conclusions), I circulate,for the information of the War Cabinet, a Memorandum showing the Admiraltyproposals for returning trawlers to the fishing industry, including remarks onthe reconversion of the vessels and the release of fishermen to man them.A. V. A.18th May, 1945.RELEASE AND RECONVERSION OF FISHING TRAWLERS.UP to the 1st May, 1945, a total of 190 fishing trawlers have been released from the Navy for reconversion to fishing since the 1st January, 1944.Eighty-four had completed reconversion and reverted to fishing by the1st May, 1945.The following table shows the British fishing trawlers on naval service athome and abroad at the 3rd May, 1945 :  Date of Construction.1890-    1915-    1921-   1929 and1914.     1920.     1928.       later.     Total.Requisitioned trawlers (includingvessels acquired bv Ministry ofWar Transport) &quot;      ......      90      176      46      126      438Purchased    from    the    fishing industry by Admiralty in 1939      ...       ...       ...        78        78Purchased    from    the    fishing industry  by   Admiralty   prior fto 1939   .......&quot;............. 8 8 JBuilt by Admiralty, 1942-43, tofishing trawler design ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        43        4386Totals ............      90      176      46      255      567From the above it will be noted that, of the 438 vessels on requisition, only126, i.e., 28 per cent., are modern vessels built in 1929 or later. Furthermore, ofthe 126 modern vessels 15, i.e., approximately 12 per cent., are less than 125 ft.in length, and of the 111 larger vessels, 25 are on service abroad. Thus, of allthe requisitioned trawlers on naval service, only 86, or approximately 20 per cent.,are large modern vessels working in Home Commands.There are, however, 86 modern vessels which the Admiralty purchased fromthe fishing industry, and these will be offered for repurchase by the tradeconcurrently with the return of the requisitioned vessels.In addition, the Admiralty built in 1942-43 a number of trawlers to fishing-vessel design, of which 43 remain on service. The suitability of these vessels forfishing will be discussed with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries with aview to their sale to the trade when they become redundant to naval requirements.[29929]
Releases.By agreement with the Prime Minister, the Admiralty undertook to release30 trawlers during April 1945. It was accepted that these would not include thelarge modern trawlers which were then engaged on Anti-Submarine duties.Actually, during April 35 were released for conversion, and of these 25 were over125 ft. and 7 were constructed in 1929 or later.With the end of hostilities in Europe, it has been possible to acceleratereleases, and from the lst-16th May a total of 74 were released for conversion.These included 19 built between 1929 and 1939, varying in size from 125 ft.-171 ft. in length, and two built in 1929 and 1930 of 122 ft. in length.In view of progress of the surrender of U-boats, steps have also been taken for the immediate release of 10 per cent, of the vessels on A.U. duties in home waters. This will yield approximately 13 large modern trawlers, though thedetails have not yet come in from all Commands.Thus, so far in May, the release of 87 trawlers has been arranged, and this number included 34 modern vessels, built in 1929 or later, the majority of whichare over 125 ft. in length.Further releases will be made with all possible despatch. For example, assoon as coastal convoys can be dispensed with, and this is expected to be in thevery near future, over 60 trawlers engaged on escort duties will be surrendered,and over 50 of these will be large modern vessels. In addition, minesweepingtrawlers will continue to be released at the rate of 34 a month for the next five months, and many trawlers engaged on other duties.The release of trawlers on service overseas is also being arranged. Instruc-tions have already been issued for the return home of a total of 44 trawlers fromthe Mediterranean, West African and South Atlantic Commands. These will include many large modern vessels. Ten of the twelve, however, which are coming from South Africa, will not arrive in the United Kingdom until July-August, asthey require refit before they can make the passage.Summary.The releases in immediate prospect are thus as follows : &apos; Already in hand for conversion on 15th May ...       ... 85Further releases arranged to take place in May...       ... 87From coastal convoys when these cease   ...       ...       ... 60From service overseas (June-August)     ...       ..!       ... 44Total        .................. 276Reconversion for Fishing.At the 15th May, 1945, 85 trawlers were in hand for conversion for fishing.It will be possible to take in hand immediately all the vessels noted above for release in May, and the expected releases for June. All vessels will, however, be carefully examined before they are put in hand in order to ensure that time andlabour are not wasted on converting old vessels which are in poor condition, at theexpense of the more modern ones, which will give a bigger return of fish supplies.The number of berths available for trawler reconversions will be increasedforthwith and is expected to increase progressively thereafter.The rate at which trawlers can be converted for fishing depends largely upon their age and general condition. Most of them have had arduous service on naval duties and in many cases they have been extensively fitted for their war-time jobs. Experience has shown that a period of three months is required from the time the vessels are taken in hand until their return to fishing.The arrangements for reconverting trawlers are being kept under regularreview in order to ensure that capacity and labour is employed to the maximum.Release of Fishermen to man trawlers.Before the war, over 21,000 men were employed in the fishing industry.At no time have there been more than 12,000 fishermen in the Navy. Many ofthese men have already been released and there are now some 8,000 remainingwho are serving in all parts of the world. They include fishermen of all types,both inshore as well as trawler men and deep-sea fishermen.An arrangement was made with the Ministry of Labour and Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries for the release of 1,000 &quot;fishermen to man the trawlerswhich have already completed their conversion for fishing or which will shortly
do so, and the majority of these men have already been released. A further70 trawlers now in hand and not covered by this arrangement will completebefore the end of August and these will require about 850 more men. Furtherfishermen will be needed to meet the increased programme of conversions and itis estimated that a peak figure of 600 to 900 men a month will be needed by theend of the year. The Admiralty would raise no objection to releasing suchnumbers though it should be pointed out that there may be no more than 2,500genuine trawlermen among the Navy&apos;s 8,000 fishermen.Under the Re-allocation Plan which comes into force on the 18th June, 1945,releases can only be made under Class A, i.e., in accordance with the Age and service Groups, or under Class B, as special cases. The latter form of releaseis restricted to certain types of employment such as building and engineering and ancillary trades.   Fishing is not at present included.Under the Navy&apos;s release programme for Class A, it is expected that 300fishermen of all types will be released by the middle of August, a further 2,000by early October and a further 1,700 by the end of December, 1945, that is atotal of 4,000 men, which will, however, possibly include only 1,000 trawler men.This would leave about another 4,000 fishermen of all types in the Navy.If they are released out of their turn in Class B it can only be done, under thepresent rules, at the expense of the building and kindred trades and may reducethe latter releases by something between 25 per cent, and 50 per cent.There are a small number of trawler fishermen known to be employed invarious civil occupations on shore and these might be drawn on first and moreperhaps could be found. Many former fishermen are, of course, getting too old,and the question of getting new blood may need consideration. The offer ofthe Minister of War Transport to make men available from the Merchant NavyPool may be valuable.
