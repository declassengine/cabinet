THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 289.7th May, 1945.WAR CABINET.PAY OF NURSING OFFICERS OF THE ARMY AND THE ROYALAIR FORCE AND OF QA.R.N.N.S.IN my view this matter is really decided by the form of the White Paper(Cmd. 6553).2. In paragraph 1 of that paper it is pointed out &quot; with the increases inthe pay and allowances of members of the forces and their families announced in the White Paper (Cmd. 6521) of April 1944, the general provision made forserving personnel was brought up to a satisfactory level.&quot; This introductorystatement makes it clear that the increases explained in the paragraphs which follow are not &quot; general &quot; increases to rates of pay, but are special increasesrelating to service of a certain duration or in a particular theatre.3. It is also made clear, so far as paragraph 2 is concerned, &apos;&apos; War Serviceincrements,&apos;&apos; that &apos;&apos; Women members of the forces will receive those incrementsat two-thirds of the appropriate men&apos;s rates.&quot;4. The increases given to the Nursing services some 12 months earlierwere essentially general increases to bring their pay up to a standard comparable with that recommended by Lord Rushcliffe&apos;s Committee on Nurses&apos; Salaries(Cmd. 6424).5. These increases had no relation whatever to the special increasesdescribed in paragraph 1 of Cmd. 6553.6. It was, indeed, the whole purpose of that paragraph to make it absolutelyclear that the increases then given were special and were related to length ofservice and the theatre of service and were not in any sense to be regarded as affecting the general rates of pay.7. This makes it quite impossible in my view to say that, so far as theNursing services are concerned, their general increase a year earlier is the equivalent of, and therefore cancels out, these special increments of the white paper.8. It would, in my opinion, be wrong to regard the earlier general increase as the equivalent of the War Service increase, just as it would be impossible to regard the increases of April 1944 (Cmd. 6521) as disentitling members of theforces to the War Service increment.9. It would obviously be impossible to omit the Naval Nursing Service fromthese benefits, though, being civilians, they are not strictly entitled to them.10. I am, therefore, of opinion that the War Service increments should bepaid to the Nursing Services of Army, Navy and Air Force.JNote by Minister of Aircraft Production.(Initialled)R. S.
