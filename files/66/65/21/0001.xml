HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVIYERNMENT I94Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.Copy No.  o (W.P. (45) 271.26^A 4pn7, 1945.WAR CABINET.TRAVEL TO BELGIUM BY MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.AT their meeting on the 8th January, 1945 (W.M. (45) 2nd Conclusions,Minute 8), the War Cabinet approved the scheme proposed in W.P. (45) 11 fortravel to France by Members of Parliament. This involved the grant of facilitiesfor (a) delegations of Members going either at the invitation of a French political party or on the initiative of the House; (b) up to six Members of each Houseweekly, selected by ballot, wishing to go to France to make themselves familiar with conditions there. The number of members taking advantage of the ballotscheme has been small: but a few have applied for facilities to visit Belgium.2. The considerations which made it desirable to introduce this special scheme for travel to France appear now to apply equally to travel to Belgium.Civilian travel to Belgium has recently started on a limited scale. The persons at present allowed to go are those whose journeys are certified by a GovernmentDepartment to be on urgent business of national importance and those withurgent compassionate reasons for travelling. Transport is the limiting factor,but there would be no difficulty in accommodating the small number of Membersof Parliament on the two routes available, viz. : (1) the R.A.F. transport command service to Brussels; (2) the sea-rail service to Paris and thence by rail to Brussels. It is not proposed to increase the number eligible to travel underthe ballot scheme, but merely to extend its scope so that those successful in the ballot would have the choice of going either to France or to Belgium or to both.They would not be able to enter army areas without S.H.A.E.F. sanction, butmilitary permits are not now required for destinations in Belgium west of theMeuse.3. If this proposal is approved, the Home Office will make the necessary arrangements for the extension of the scheme with the appropriate officers of theHouse of Commons and House of Lords.4. An announcement should be made simultaneously in both Houses, andshould include a warning that hotel accommodation is virtually unobtainable andthat Members are likely to experience considerable difficulties unless they havefriends who can put them up.5.   The Foreign Office concur in this memorandum.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1,26th April, 1945.[29793]
