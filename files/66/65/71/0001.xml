MAN-POWER-JUNE TO DECEMBER 1945.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE following report is submitted in accordance with the Prime Ministersdirective W.P. (45) 250. As VE-day has now occurred, arrangements have beenmade for release to begin on the 18th June, and for the initial measures ofredeployment to proceed immediately. The assessment of the R.A.F. man-power position has been based accordingly. It is assumed that the Japanese war lastsa further eighteen months.2. The personnel strength of the R.A.F. at the 31st May, 1946, requiredfor the R.A.F. quotient of the air forces to be deployed against Japan, in theEuropean theatre and along the Imperial lines of communication, in accordancewith the Chiefs of Staffs report C.O.S. (45) 310 (0), is assessed at 757,000.3. The first charge upon the R.A.F. man-power becoming available at theend of the German war must be the needs of the war against Japan. The time factor here is of the first importance. In Air Command South-East Asia, themain intake into India is phased to begin in August; and the base establishmentsmust be built up and existing personnel deficiencies made good in advance of the arrival of the reinforcing squadrons. A rapid increase is planned in transport command, both in support of operations and to enable the programme of large-scale trooping by air to begin on the 1st October. If the V.L.R. bomber force is to be fully operational in the spring of 1946, it must be fully deployed, withits base installations and airfields made ready in advance, by the beginning of next year.4. In W.P. (44) 728, I stated that an entry of 50,000 was required into theground training organisation in the first half of this year, in order to enableredeployment and release to proceed satisfactorily after the 30th June, and thatthese men must be fit for overseas service and in low release priority. I antici-pated that most of these men could be found from instructional and maintenancestaffs and aircrew trainees becoming available owing to the planned reductions in flying training. The subsequent decision that provision should be made againstthe continuance of the German wrar until the end of 1945 rendered impossiblereductions in flying training, necessitated a diminution of R.A.F. squadronstrength during recent months and prevented a start being made on theretraining programme for Stage II. In addition, the R.A.F. was required totransfer 20,000 men to the Army to help to meet the Army&apos;s Stage II require-ments. I must thus emphasise that the R.A.F. finds itself at the beginning of stage II without having been able to effect any of the essential measures ofretraining required.5.   The flying training organisation will now be reduced by 31st May to thelevel recmired to provide aircrew replacements only for those squadrons requitedduring Stage II.   This is the greatest immediate source from which man-power[29949]
can be made available for redistribution or release. The reduction of the R.A.F.generally in the inactive theatres to the ultimate Stage II levels will proceed as rapidly as strategic requirements and administrative possibilities permit. in w.P. (44) 728, I stated that there would be a progressive reduction in the strengthof the R.A.F. to a level of 327 squadrons, planned to be reached nine months afterthe end of the German war. Eighty-three of these were to be Dominion and allied squadrons. The force required by C.O.S. (45) 310 (0) totals 310 squadrons,of which 71 are Dominion and Allied squadrons. The reduction to this level, is planned to be virtually complete by the end of January next year; the reductionof the ancillary establishments will naturally lag behind the first line reduction,but every effort will be made to accelerate this process.6. The strength of the R.A.F. at the end of this month is estimated, to be1,116,000; the strength required at 31st May, 1946 (see paragraph 2 above) is757,000. Transfers of personnel to the Army and Navy in accordance with cabinet decisions have proceeded slowly; 15,000 men remain to be transferred tothe Navy and 10,000 to the Army. Allowing for wastage and for the release of asmall number of personnel to be completed after 31st May. 1946, I estimate that266,000 personnel would be available for return to civil life during the twelvemonths if no new intake were available.7. It is not, however, possible to do without an intake of new man-power.There is a radical change in the personnel pattern of the R.A.F. in Stage II,inasmuch as : (i) There is an increase in the ratio of men required in certain trades, andfewer W.A.A.F. generally can be employed,(ii) A far higher proportion of men will be stationed overseas. In viewof the number of tour-expired personnel due for release, and thenumber of men at home who have completed an overseas tour or are due to be demobilised, eligibility for overseas service is now a criticalfactor. The R.A.E. has so far employed in the ground trades ahigh proportion of older men and men of low medical grades who arenot eligible for overseas service, in order to reduce as far as possibleits demands for young fit men other than for aircrew,(iii) Provision has to be made for the operation of the release scheme.On these grounds, a large programme of remustering and retraining is essential if the needs of redeployment and release are to be fulfilled, and it is not possiblefor more than a proportion of the men now required to be trained to be found from within the existing strength of the R.A.F.8. To meet. Stage II requirements, it will be necessary to remuster duringthe next six months 96.500 men and women to &quot;new employments, some 72,000 ofwhom will have to undergo courses of technical training. Of these 96,500, it isexpected that 22.000 will be found from personnel redundant in their presenttrades and not in early release priorities, 22,500 from redundant aircrew per-sonnel, and 11,000 from other sources, leaving a balance of 41,000 to be found from new man-power. Unless this entry can be supplied, it will be impossibleto meet full redeployment requirements in the Far East or to demobilise menin certain trades when their turn comes for release.9.   The existing overseas tour for the R.A.F. is Single men      ...       ...       ...      4 years.Married men   ...       ...       ...       3 years.Average ...       ...       ...       3 years 8 months.It is, indeed, highly desirable to reduce the R.A.F. tour to 3 years in line with,the Army tour now proposed; this would, however, involve a further increasein overseas drafting of some 30,000 personnel up to the 31st December, 1945, asubstantial number of whom could only be provided by training new man-power.As the training organisation will be stretched to the limit to meet redeploymenton the basis of the existing tour, I do not propose a reduction in the tour at thisstage, and have accordingly stated no man-power requirement in respect of it. i must, however, reserve the right to include such a requirement at a later stage,when the training organisation permits of further intakes of man-power for thispurpose.10. An entry of 1,500 boys for apprentice training is required to meet post-war needs. .
11. The effect of the new entry I ask for will be to increase the numbersavailable for release over and above those indicated in paragraph 6 above, and the revised figure, assuming the new intake is authorised, will be approximately306,000 by the 31st May, 1946.12. The incidence of release will, to a large extent, be governed by the time it will take to make completely available personnel of units following a decision to close down, and to effect the consequential redistribution of personnel. an inevitable time lag is involved in the completion of these processes after establish-ments have been reduced. On the basis of present plans, and pendingpractical experience of the working of our arrangements, I consider that a total of137,500 personnel can be released by the 31st December, 1945. I hope it may bepossible to improve on this programme, as the scheme develops, but for thereasons stated in paragraph 4 above the R.A.F. is in a very difficult position.13. The above is exclusive of Class B releases. Allowing for these at therate of 10 per cent, of the Class A releases, the total releases will be as follows : By the 31st December, 1945, 151,250 including 12,250 women.By the 31st May, 1946, 336,000 including 37,750 women.In order to allow for some measure of training to be given to men entering theService to replace Class B releases before the releases are made, the whole of the intake on Class B account is required by the end of this year.14.   The total intake of men required is therefore :  (i) for redeployment and Class A releases   ...      41,000(ii) for Class B releases ...       ......       30,000(iii) for apprentice training     ...       ...       ...        1,50072,50015. A small intake of women would be acceptable if they are available;the intake of men in this event could be reduced.16. I wish, at this point, to raise the question of the transfer of men fromthe R.A.F. to the Army. Of the total of 20,000 which are required to betransferred, 10,000 will remain at the end of this month. All these men havebeen trained to R.A.F. standards, but they will have to be retrained to army requirements. It is a waste of effort for the R.A.F. to train men from the newintake, and for the Army at the same time to retrain these airmen. It -will alsobe difficult to justify the transfer to the Army of men aged 35 from the R.A.F.when it is known that men from civil life up to 30 years of age are being enteredinto the R.A.F. The transfers create discontent in the Service, and shouldnot be continued unless they are unavoidable. If the transfer of the remaining10,000 could be foregone, and allowing for the release in their age group of25 per cent, of the men to be transferred, the new intake could be reduced to65,000 and the total of releases increased by 2,500. Pending consideration bythe Cabinet of the whole maii-power position, I have informed the Secretary ofState for War that I am suspending further transfers from the R.A.F. to theArmy.17. I do not suggest any modification in the transfers to the Royal Navy;these men were entered into the R.A.F. on the understanding that they woulclbe so transferred at the end of the German war.18. Finally, I desire to draw attention to a passage in the White Paper(Cmd. 6548) which gave great satisfaction to men of the Services and contributedgreatly to the favourable reception which the Reallocation of Man-power schemereceived.    I refer to para. lgJ .-.   Ill ftr.djr. to, increase the releases in class A and to compensate for the transfers in Class B, numbers of young menat present deferred particularly in the munitions industries, will be called up tothe Forces.&quot; So far as the R.A.F. at least is concerned, I anticipate real dissatis-faction unless an appreciable further withdrawal of deferred men from industry can now be effected.19.   To summarise, I ask the Cabinet to approve (i) The cessation of further transfers of men to the Army,(ii) An intake of new man-pov/er of 65,000.   A small number of womenwoulcl be acceptable in this total.
(iii) A programme of releases as follows :By 31st December, 1945 ...    139,0139,000 men (to age group 21-^).12,350 women (50 per cent, of the married women).300,750 men (to age group 25).37,750 women (all the married womenBy 31st May, 1946and additionally up to age group 36).The proportion of women to men may be varied when the options for priorityrelease of married women are received.20. I estimate that some 11,000 civilian industrial employees can be released by the end of 1945. These men will come from the Royal Observer Corps andAir Ministry Works Department. In other R.A.F. civilian industrial establish-ments generally, it will be necessary fur wastage to be made good.21. No account is taken in this paper of the requirements of doctors and nurses.23rd May, 1945.Postscript.This paper takes no account of the revised scheme submitted with myapproval by the Chiefs of Staff to the Prime Minister on the 18th May,for maintaining temporarily the first line strength of the R.A.F. at as high a level as possible, while interfering as little as possible withdemobilisation releases. Provided these revised arrangements are notrequired to remain in force for more than a few weeks, I hope thatthe planned programme of releases can be adhered to. On any othercondition, an entirely fresh appreciation of the position would berequired.Note. The Ministry of Labour have asked for a statement to be recorded of the estimatedstrength of the R.A.F. at the 30th September, 1945, and the 31st December, 1945, allowing forClass A releases, but not for any new intake.
