THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET. / Copy No. o7. VW.P. (45) 277.28th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.THE STATE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.Memorandum by the Postmaster-General.I have read with interest WP. (45) 265, but before a decision is taken touse St. Stephen&apos;s Hall as a temporary House of Commons for only a short periodeach year, I think it my duty to call the attention of my colleagues to analternative purpose for which I think part of St. Stephen&apos;s Hall should be usedduring the whole of the period of reconstruction, and that is for the provision of postal facilities for Members of Parliament.As soon as the demolition of the old Chamber and its surrounds begins, theexisting Members&apos; Post Office will be closed (and for all I know this may be beforethe next State Opening), and I shall have to provide an alternative and analternative which may have to last four or five years. I have been consideringvarious suggestions, and by far the best, from the point of view of convenience of Members and easy working by the Post Office staff, would be for them to usetemporary accommodation in St. Stepheihs Hall as indeed was done when wefirst returned to the Palace of Westminster after the bombing, and before theold Post Office in the Members&apos; Lobby was restored. The only reasonablealternative suggestions at present before me are (i) that the Public Office (now in the Central Lobby) should become theMembers&apos; Post Office, and that the Public Office, which is for the useof the press, Lobby correspondents, &amp;o, should be housed in atemporary structure in Westminster Hall;(ii) that the public office (now in the Central Lobby) should be jointly used by Members and the public; this, however, would involve throwingforward into the Lobby two counters by a temporary and inevitablyinharmonious piece of construction : Members may well object tothis joint user.In the case of either of these alternatives, there would be grave difficulties forthe Post Office staff, both in obtaining access to the Office and in the sorting, &amp;c,of Members&apos; correspondence, which would have to be done in an inferiordownstairs room near the boilers.I hope, therefore, that before it is decided to reserve St. Stephehs Hall forthe use proposed in W.P. (45) 265, thus sterilising it for other purposes, due consideration will be given to the best method of meeting the needs of Membersof Parliament as regards postal facilities and the needs of the Post Office staff for reasonable working accommodation over what will be a considerable periodof time. Incidentally this use of part of St. Stephen&apos;s Hall would makeunnecessary the temporary structure proposed to be erected in Westminster Hallas a Public Office if alternative (i) were adopted.H. 0.General Post Office Headquarters,London, E.C. 1,   .28th April, 1945.[29804]
