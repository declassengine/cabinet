THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS &quot;GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 262.19th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.RELEASE OF MINERS FROM THE ARMED FORCES:EFFECT ON SUPPLIES.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.WHILST I fully appreciate the arguments which, have led the ministerial committee to their conclusion, I should make it clear that the adoption of their recommendations (W.P. (45) 257) will still leave the Coal Budget with a deficit of some 4 million tons.   Consumption must, therefore, be reduced by that amount.2. A part of the necessary cuts can be borne by industry but, in view of theimportance of maintaining stocks of suitable coal for gas works and railways,the largest contribution must come from the house-coal market. This means thatdomestic consumers will receive about 30 per cent, less house coal than in 1942.3. I am rigorously overhauling the arrangements for the distribution of house coal, but, even with mild weather and without stoppages, there will be difficulty in holding the position.4. I have now received a statement of S.H.A.E.F. requirements for theperiod after August 1945 and the War Cabinet will be aware of the proposalto resume full street lighting after the 15th July, which involves a further750,000 tons per annum. Such demands for high-quality coal can only be met by further cuts on domestic consumption, and in my view these cannot bejustified.5. The situation, it is clear, is serious, and I feel the War Cabinet shouldbe aware of the implications for the domestic consumer and the possible effect on public morale next winter.G. LI. G.Ministry of Fuel and Power, Millbank, S.W.1,lWi April, 1945.[29756]
