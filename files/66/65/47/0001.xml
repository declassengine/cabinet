Printed for the War Cabinet, May, 1945TOP secret.P. (45) 297jth May, 1945The   circulation  ol  this   paper  has  been strictly   limited.    J    is   issued   for   theJpersoEial use of copy No.   $ (WAR CABINETARMY MANPOWERPROGRAMME OF RELEASES TO 30th JUNE, 1946 AND NEWREQUIREMENTS TO 31st DECEMBER, 1945MEMORANDUM  BY THE SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR WAR1. I circulate herewith a review of the manpower problems of the Army over the nextthirteen months, with particular reference to the releases to civil life which will have to takeplace during that time, and to the new intakes which will be required between July and december, 1945, inclusive, in order to be fully trained and effective in the period January toJune, 1946.2. The three dominant features of the period under review are :(a) The Army will have to change in size, shape, and distribution.   To conform with thelatest Chiefs of Staff appreciation of requirements for Stage II of the War it willhave to shrink to a strength of some 1 - 45 million men and women by the middleof 1946.   Much re-organization, retraining and redeployment will have to be done.(b) Releases to civil life of the balance of the present strength of the Army involvingsome 1 - 54 million men and women will have to be effected.(c) Even with the relief which the release scheme will bring about there will still be alarge number of men who will have served for a long period overseas. Themeasure of the problem can be judged from the fact that to realize my announcedaim of a three years&apos; tour everywhere some 250,000 men would have to be exchanged in the period. Even for an intermediate aim of three years in the far east and three and a half years elsewhere the number is 185,000.3. The three problems are of course interconnected, the first and third being very muchdependent on the phasing of the release scheme which is designed to deal with nearly half amillion men and women between July and December, 1945, and pretty well a million more inthe first half of 1946. Provided there is no radical change in this programme I feel reasonablysure we can do the re-organization required and achieve at any rate the intermediate aim inregard to the tour of service overseas, if we are given the following intakes : (a) to replace normal wastage (paragraphs 13 and 14 of Annex)       ...       ...       21,500(b) to offset Class B releases (paragraph 16 of Annex) which are in fact exchanges    105,000(c) to replace a large unabsorbable surplus of Pioneers (paragraph 17 of Annex);this also is an exchange      ...       ...       ...      ...       ...       ...       ...      50,000Total ........................     176,5004. I would point out that I have asked for no specific intake to cover exchanges requiredto reduce the overseas tour as intended. I intend to do this from within the working margin of manpower which we shall have if the release scheme operates as planned.5. I would draw the attention of my colleagues to the general statement in the white paper on re-allocation of manpower during Stage II of the War, in which it has been accepted as axiomatic that the period will be governed by the paramount consideration that there can beno break in the war effort, and that Japan must be beaten at the earliest possible moment.The whole Army release programme and the requirements of new intakes are framed on thisoverriding consideration.6. I therefore ask the War Cabinet to approve the Army programme for releases annexed to this Review, and to allocate for the period July to December, 1945, an intake of 176,500men as detailed in paragraph 3 above, together with the numbers needed for A.T.S. setout in Part V of the Review. It is to be remarked that of the 176,500 all but 21,500will be later offset by men released from the Army over and above those under Class A.7tli May, 1945.P. J. G.
REVIEW OF ARMY MANPOWER MAY, 1945on the assumption that (a) the war with Germany ends not later than 31st May, 1945 ;(b) the Japanese war lasts thereafter for one and a half years.PART I-GENERAL STATEMENT1. This review deals in particular with (i) the programme of releases to civil life from the Army in the thirteen monthsfollowing the defeat of Germany, i.e., until the end of June, 1946, and(ii) the new intakes required between July and December, 1945.   The conditionsdetermining these requirements are those which will exist in the first sixmonths of 1946, the period when the intakes become fully trained and thuseffective.In order to make the review complete, it is necessary to deal with the manpowersituation as it has worked out in recent months in addition to the period of thirteen monthsahead.2. (a) The aim of the Army to be attained by the end of June, 1946, may be statedto be: (i) to have re-organized to a strength, correctly distributed throughout the world,adequate to undertake prescribed strategic requirements,(ii) to have completed the phased programme of release to civil life,(hi) to have reduced the overseas tour of service to the greatest extent practicable,and if possible to a maximum of three years.(b) The magnitude of these problems is set out below: (i) Strategic requirements.As a result of the latest appreciation&quot;&apos;&quot; by the Chiefs of Staff, the total strength of the Army (after taking into account the employment of german prisoners of war) needed for the revised requirements for Stage II, i.e., by june, 1946, will not be less than -45 millions(1,360,000 men and 90,000 women)This figure has been taken as a basis in assessing the effect of therelease scheme.(ii) Releases to civil life.The Army should be prepared to make releases to civilian life of theorder of1- 54 millions(1,440,000 men and 105,000 women)(iii) Overseas tour of service.To reduce the tour of service overseas to a maximum of three yearsworldwide would involve the exchange of some quarter of a million men.3. The conditions governing the situation during the period, which is an interim onebetween the defeat of Germany and that of Japan, will be as follows : (a) The role of the Army will change in that only a portion will be actively engaged, the remainder being required primarily for the occupation of enemy territory and as a strategic reserve.(b) For the new role a considerable change in shape will be required, involving adifferent distribution between the various arms. This change will be carriedout throughout the period, and must be completed by the middle of 1946.(c) the process of releases will be well under way by the end of 1945, by which date it is expected that some 450,000 men and women under Class A will havebeen released to civil life. But the bulk of the releases of the order of amillion will have to be effected during the first half of 1946.4. The various problems enumerated above are dealt with in detail in the followingparts: Part II Review of the position, January to December, 1945 Men.Part III Releases to civil life Men and women.Part IV Review of situation, January to June, 1946 Men, with particular reference to intakes required from July to December, 1945.Part V Women&apos;s services and civilians and summary of requirements.* COS (45) 310 (O).
PART II-REVIEW OF POSITION, JANUARY TO DECEMBER, 1945-MEN5. The total intake demanded* for the period January to June, 1945, was 251,500. Thenet intake approved (excluding Royal Marines who will revert to the Navy at the end of theGerman War) was 132,000, comprising (a) Normal intake      ...       ...       ...       ...       ......       ...   104,000(b) Basically trained transfers from other services ...       ...     28,000It is being assumed that the balances of 10,000 to complete (a), and 18,400 to complete(b) above will be forthcoming in June or soon after.Only 9,600 basically trained men have so far been received from the other Services andthose, together with the outstanding balance of 18,400, will only be available towards therequirements of the latter part of this year. Their late arrival has meant that it has notbeen possible to use them for the purpose for which they were asked, i.e., in order to commence early in the year a considerable reduction in the overseas tour of service.6. To supplement the January to June intake there will, however, become effectiveduring July to December the following assets upon which no reliance could be placed atthe time that the original demand was made (a) Released prisoners of war. Of the total number of prisoners of war to bereturned from German camps the number who will be eligible by age and length of service to continue in the Army during Stage II is estimated at47,000. It is expected that some 15,000 of these will have to be dischargedfor medical and other reasons leaving a total asset of 32,000. Having regardto the probable dates and rate of repatriation and the period of leave andrefresher training which will be needed, it is estimated that men will become available for duty during July to December to the number of25,000leaving 7,000 to come in as an asset later.(b) Over-estimate of casualties January to June, 1945. The casualties incurred in all theatres from January to the latest date for which figures are available havebeen appreciably below estimates. An adjustment on account of this general trend has now been made to the earlier estimates for April and May,together with the amendment required to the June forecast to meet the newplanning date for the end of the German war. These factors together are estimated to yield97,0007. Taking the above into consideration, the demand for 251,000 can be assumed to havebeen met as follows : Intakes and transfers from other services     ...       ...       ...       ...       ...   132,000Returned prisoners of war       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...     25,000Savings on casualties    ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...     97,000Total    ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...   254,000Although all the basically trained assets were not received in the phasing required, it hasbeen possible by internal reorganization to maintain and even increase the offensive strengthof the army ; to make a very small start in reducing the overseas tour of service ; and to begin the preparation and despatch of troops to the Far East without prejudice to operations on the Continent.PART III RELEASES TO CIVIL LIFE-MEN AND WOMEN8. In the year following the defeat of Germany the factor which willovershadow all manpower and organisational planning will be the releasescheme.The strength of the Army at the present time is some 2 - 99 millions (men and women)and the total required for Stage II is 1-45 millions. The total numbers to be releasedwill, therefore, be some 1-54 millions (men and women).9. The rate at which release can be effected, subject to the paramount operational requirements accepted in paragraph 1 of the Government White Paperf, will be influenced bythe following military factors: (a) the re-organization of the Army, particularly for the Japanese war ;(b) the heavy demands on the Army in the initial stages of the occupationof Europe after the defeat of Germany ;(c) the need to shorten the tour of service abroad.(d) the shipping available for movement of men serving overseas.*w.p. (44) 705.t Comd. 6548.
io. These factors in combination preclude any immediate large drop in the strengthof the Army. The programme of releases must be phased, if operational requirements are not to be prejudiced, so as to throw the weight into the second half of theperiod. The practical problems of reorganization involving large scale measures of sortingand retraining individuals referred to in Part IV, paragraph 17 together with the require-ments for initiating the contemplated reduction in the overseas tour Part IV, paragraph 20 -will necessitate possession throughout the period of an adequate working margin of manpower.While, therefore, the full number of 1 - 54 millions will become eligible for release by theend of June, 1946, the programme at Appendix &quot; A &quot; represents the maximum practicablerate if the military considerations stated above are to be met. The rate of release issummarized as follows Men Women(a) up to the end of 1945      .........     408,000 47,000(b) from January to June, 1946, inclusive     S92,000 58,000(c) balance,  June, 1946 and as soon aspracticable thereafter ...      ...      ...     140,000Total      ...   1,440,000 105,000II, Class B Releases. In addition to the 1,440,000 men to be released to complete the class A programme the Army will be expected to return to civil life under Class B of therelease regulations up to 10 per cent, of the total released under Class A, i.e., some 144,000 men.For these men replacements are to be provided* and this exchange will be essential in order tomaintain the Stage II strength of the Army. The effect of this policy of replacement on theintakes required by the Army during the period July to December, 1945, is dealt with in Part IV.It is planned to effect Class B releases on a programme parallel with the releases under Class Aand the total planned for release under Class B by the end of 1945 is, therefore, some 41,000men, rising by the end of June, 1946, to a figure of 130,000. Since the types of men to be withdrawn are likely to be composed mainly of Army tradesmen, thereby imposing a very heavy and disproportionate strain on a relatively few arms of the Service, it will not be practicable to carry out any faster programme of Class B releases. Acceleration would inevitably result in a loss of efficiency in units which would be operationally unacceptable.PART IV-REVIEW OF SITUATION JANUARY TO JUNE, 1946-MEN, WITHPARTICULAR REFERENCE TO INTAKES required FROM JULY TODECEMBER, 1945.12. The factors which will arise during the period January to June, 1946, and willinfluence directly or indirectly the requirements of new intakes needed between July and december, 1945, are set out in the following paragraphs.13. Returned prisoners of war. As shown in Part II, paragraph 6 (a), the proportion ofreturned prisoners of war which can be taken as an asset during this period is,00014. Normal Wastage. The Army can only achieve its full target of releases and still remain at the strength required for Stage II if wastage from normal causes, pro-portionate to the decreasing strength as releases bring about an automatic reduction in size, is replaced by new intakes. Experience has shown that the figure of 7,000 per month for the wastage from normal causes on the present strength of the Army hascontinued to hold good. Using this rate, the wastage from normal causes during thefirst half of 1946, proportionate to the reduced strength of the Army, will be January to March, 1946, average 5,400 per month-16,200April to June, 1946, average 4,100 per month       = 12,300making a total for normal wastage of28,50015. Battle Casualties. The main features in dealing with the requirements for replacement of battle casualties during this period will be that the incidence will be confined, generally speaking, to one theatre. After taking credit for sick and v/oundedreturning to duty it is considered that battle casualties requiring replacement between january to June, 1946, can be covered from within the resources of the Army, and no new intakes on this account are now demanded.16. Class B Releases. As stated in Part III, paragraph 11, it is essential that the effective strength of the Army for Stage II should not be prejudiced by the Class b releases. A man released under Class B must therefore be replaced, as soon as with-drawn, by a fully trained soldier.   This is only possible if the replacement enters the* Gomd. 6548 paragraph 13.
Army for training at least six months before the Class B man is withdrawn. The totalnumber of Class B releases (see Part III, paragraph ii) will amount to 144,000, of which130,000 will fall due to be effected by 30th June, 1946, to match the planned programme forClass A. Replacements for the first 25,000 due to be withdrawn have already beendemanded and, as indicated in paragraph 7, can be considered as having been received.There will remain a balance for whom replacements are needed as new intakes in the second half of 1945, amounting to105,00017. Effect of application of Class A Releases. The automatic application through-out the Army of a formula governing release to civil life based on a combination ofage and length of service will necessarily result in an uneven incidence of run-downas between the various arms. Some will be left far short of their requirements for stage II, whereas others will be left with a surplus. It is intended to adjust this lackof balance to the maximum extent possible by retraining the men left surplus in certainarms to meet the deficiencies in others; and to offset the resultant loss in effectivestrength during retraining by making use of the margin of manpower referred to inPart III, paragraph 10. There is one instance, however, in which the Army is facedwith a problem which cannot be solved by the means proposed. There will remaineligible for Stage II and surplus to requirements in that arm some 50,000 men of the pioneer Corps. The physical and mental standards of these men make it impossibleto fit them even by retraining for duty in other arms. Until about the end of 1945 itshould be possible to employ the men at Ordnance Depots and other installations wherethe load is likely for a time to remain high; but during the first half of 1946 it will benecessary for them to be removed from the Army strength.The Army cannot afford to retain these redundant men against its Stage II ceilingand the only solution is an exchange for new intakes received during July and December,1945.   The requirement on this account is50,00018. Relief of men with Long Service Overseas (PYTHON) -The demand for intakessubmitted in December, 1944*, included a large element for the purpose of initiating fromthe beginning of 1945 a substantial reduction in the length of the overseas tour. the reduced intake allotted, although now being made up to the demand by the savings andother factors referred to in Part II, paragraph 7, did not permit a reduction of morethan a few months. The average length of the tour is now aboutFar East        .....................      3t yearsOther Theatres ..................      4i Years19. The need to shorten, the tour as early as possible remains because there will stillbe large numbers of men who, though ineligible for release, will have been a long timeoverseas. Indeed, this need will be of even greater importance when the German waris over. The risk to the morale of the Army resulting from a continuance of the presentlong tour overseas was stressed in the previous review,* and the fact that it has not already given rise to disaffection within the Army may be due primarily to the rapidityand success with which operations have developed and to the prospect of an early ending of the German war.20. The fact that large numbers of men due for return to U.K. under the PYTHONscheme will be coming home, in any event, for release, will leave a more manageablebalance to be dealt with in any measures for shortening the tour. But there will still be considerable numbers to be exchanged, over the year to June, 1946, varying accordingto the length of the tour abroad, as follows :(a) to maintain present tour (see paragraph 18)      ...      ...       ...        48,000(b) to attain the aim of 3 3?ears for all theatres      ...       ...       ...      256,000(c) to attain an intermediate reduction to Far East   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        3 years \    oOther overseas theatres ...      ...      ...      ...       3J years J   x&amp;5&apos;000If the programme of releases is carried out as planned in Part III, paragraph 10, itis estimated that the working margin of manpower thus attained will be sufficient to achieve the intermediate reduction stated in (c) above, without any fresh intakes on this account. But it must be pointed out that the problem of the large block of men whowent to N Africa in the winter of 1942/43 and which is responsible for the sharp rise inthe figure in (b) above is only being postponed for a short period. The possibility ofa demand for intakes on this account at a later date cannot, therefore, be completelyexcluded.* W.P. (44) 705.
io. These factors in combination preclude any immediate large drop in the strengthof the Army. The programme of releases must be phased, if operational requirements are not to be prejudiced, so as to throw the weight, into the second half of theperiod. The practical problems of reorganization involving large scale measures of sortingand retraining individuals referred to in Part IV, paragraph 17 together with the require-ments for initiating the contemplated reduction in the overseas tour-Part IV, paragraph 20 will necessitate possession throughout the period of an adequate working margin of manpower.While, therefore, the full number of 1 - 54 millions will become eligible for release by theend of June, 1946, the programme at Appendix &quot; A &quot; represents the maximum practicablerate if the military considerations stated above are to be met. The rate of release issummarized as follows Men Women(a) up to the end of 1945     .........     408,000 47,000(b) from January to June, 1946, inclusive     892,000 58,000(c) balance,  June, 1946 and as soon aspracticable thereafter ...      ...      ...     140,000  Total      ...   1,440,000 105,00011. Class B Releases. In addition to the 1,440,000 men to be released to complete the class A programme the Army will be expected to return to civil life under Class B of therelease regulations up to 10 per cent, of the total released under Class A, i.e., some 144,000 men.For these men replacements are to be provided* and this exchange will be essential in order tomaintain the Stage II strength of the Army. The effect of this policy of replacement on theintakes required by the Army during the period July to December, 1945, is dealt with in Part IV.It is planned to effect Class B releases on a programme parallel with the releases under Class Aand the total planned for release under Class B by the end of 1945 is, therefore, some 41,000men, rising by the end of June, 1946, to a figure of 130,000. Since the types of men to be withdrawn are likely to be composed mainly of Army tradesmen, thereby imposing a very heavy and disproportionate strain on a relatively few arms of the Service, it will not be practicable to carry out any faster programme of Class B releases. Acceleration would inevitably result in a loss of efficiency in units which would be operationally unacceptable.PART IV-REVIEW OF SITUATION JANUARY TO JUNE, 1946-MEN, WITHPARTICULAR REFERENCE TO INTAKES REQUIRED FROM JULY TODECEMBER, 1945.12. The factors which will arise during the period January to June, 1946, and willinfluence directly or indirectly the requirements of new intakes needed between July and december, 1945, are set out in the following paragraphs.13. Returned prisoners of war. As shown in Part II, paragraph 6 (a), the proportion ofreturned prisoners of war which can be taken as an asset during this period is,00014. Normal Wastage. The Army can only achieve its full target of releases and still remain at the strength required for Stage II if wastage from normal causes, pro-portionate to the decreasing strength as releases bring about an automatic reduction in size, is replaced by new intakes. Experience has shown that the figure of 7,000 per month for the wastage from normal causes on the present strength of the Army hascontinued to hold good. Using this rate, the wastage from normal causes during thefirst half of 1946, proportionate to the reduced strength of the Army, will be January to March, 1946, average 5,400 per 11100.111 = 16,200April to June, 1946, average 4,100 per month       = 12,300making a total for normal wastage of28,50015. Battle Casualties. The main features in dealing with the requirements for replacement of battle casualties during this period will be that the incidence will be confined, generally speaking, to one theatre. After taking credit for sick and woundedreturning to duty it is considered that battle casualties requiring replacement between january to June, 1946, can be covered from within the resources of the Army, and no new intakes on this account are now demanded.16. Class B Releases. As stated in Part III, paragraph 11, it is essential that the effective strength of the Army for Stage II should not be prejudiced by the Class b releases. A man released under Class B must therefore be replaced, as soon as with-drawn, by a fully trained soldier.   This is only possible if the replacement enters the* Comd. 6548 paragraph 13.
oArmy for training at least six months before the Class B man is withdrawn. The totalnumber of Class B releases (see Part III, paragraph n) will amount to 144,000, of which130,000 will fall due to be effected by 30th June, 1946, to match the planned programme forClass A. Replacements for the first 25,000 due to be withdrawn have already beendemanded and, as indicated in paragraph 7, can be considered as having been received.There will remain a balance for whom replacements are needed as new intakes in the second half of 1945, amounting to105,00017. Effect of application of Class A Releases. The automatic application through-out the Army of a formula governing release to civil life based on a combination ofage and length of service will necessarily result in an uneven incidence of run-downas between the various arms. Some will be left far short of their requirements for stage II, whereas others will be left with a surplus. It is intended to adjust this lackof balance to the maximum extent possible by retraining the men left surplus in certainarms to meet the deficiencies in others; and to offset the resultant loss in effectivestrength during retraining by making use of the margin of manpower referred to inPart III, paragraph 10. There is one instance, however, in which the Army is facedwith a problem which cannot be solved by the means proposed. There will remaineligible for Stage II and surplus to requirements in that arm some 50,000 men of the pioneer Corps. The physical and mental standards of these men make it impossibleto fit them even by retraining for duty in other arms.

The requirement on this account is50,00018. Relief of men with Long Service Overseas (PYTHON). The demand for intakessubmitted in December, 1944*, included a large element for the purpose of initiating fromthe beginning of 1945 a substantial reduction in the length of the overseas tour. the reduced intake allotted, although now being made up to the demand by the savings andother factors referred to in Part II, paragraph 7, did not permit a reduction of morethan a few months.  The average length of the tour is now aboutFar East        .....................      3! YearsOther Theatres ......       ............      4^ years19. The need to shorten the tour as early as possible remains because there will stillbe large numbers of men who, though ineligible for release, will have been a long timeoverseas. Indeed, this need will be of even greater importance when the German waris over. The risk to the morale of the Army resulting from a continuance of the presentlong tour overseas was stressed in the previous review,* and the fact that it has not already given rise to disaffection within the Army may be due primarily to the rapidityand success with which operations have developed and to the prospect of an early ending of the German war.20. The fact that large numbers of men due for return to U.K. under the PYTHONscheme will be coming home, in any event, for release, will leave a more manageablebalance to be dealt with in any measures for shortening the tour. But there will still be considerable numbers to be exchanged, over the year to June, 1946, varying accordingto the length of the tour abroad, as follows:(a) to maintain present tour (see paragraph 18)      ...       ...       ...        48,000(b) to attain the aim of 3 years for all theatres      ...       ...       ...      256,000(c) to attain an intermediate reduction to Far East   ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        3  years!

But it must be pointed out that the problem of the large block of men whowent to N. Africa in the winter of 1942/43 and which is responsible for the sharp rise inthe figure in (b) above is only being postponed for a short period. The possibility ofa demand for intakes on this account at a later date cannot, therefore, be completelvexcluded.* W.P. (44) 705.
h.21. Leave. Depending on the extent to which we are able to reduce the tourabroad, the necessity for a leave scheme will diminish. In the early period there willbe considerable numbers of men with over two years&apos; service overseas and not yeteligible for either release or PYTHON. Some continuance of the leave scheme will,therefore, be necessary, but again can be covered by the same working margin. No newintake is needed.22. Summary of Requirements July to December, 1945. Men. The requirementsof new intakes of men during the period July to December, 1945, inclusive, aresummarized as follows:  Required to replace (a) Wastage Normal causes ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      28,500Battle casualties      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... nil28,500Less balance of returned prisoners of war becomingeffective from January, 1946 (paragraph 13)   ... 7,000(b) Exchanges Class B releases       ............... 105,000Pioneers not re-absorbable in the Army   ...       ... 50,00021,500155,000NET REQUIREMENT...... 176,500PART V-WOMEN&apos;S SERVICES AND CIVILIANS AND SUMMARY OFREQUIREMENTS23. Womens Services.(a) A.T.S. Apart from the run-down in the A.T.S. up to the end of december that will result automatically from the application of the release scheme,it is essential that there should be no loss of strength during July-December, 1945, from wastage among those who are not being released.The intake on this account is13,000(6) Nursing Officers and V.A.Ds. These are now dealt with by the lord presidents Committee.24. Civilian Requirements.It is very difficult to make any estimate of the number of civilians which will berequired. In some indeed many of the W.D. establishments, e.g., Records, the pressurewill be greater than during the continuance of the German War. From many of them therewill have been a great efflux of military personnel. There will also be a great exodus of married women. It is very unlikely that the Minister of Labour will wish to use hisremaining special powers to direct persons to these establishments and so the best we can hope for is a controlled rate of run-down. There is, however, one particular requirement for civilians which must be met, viz., N.A.A.F.I. With the opening of Rangoon, N.A.A.F.I. isto take over from the Indian Canteen Board the whole responsibility for S.E.A.C. and it willalso have to establish a full scale of services in occupied Europe. They will therefore need to replace wastage and to take in 22,000 civilian employees as well.Summary of Requirements25.
