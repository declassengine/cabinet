In 1914 Great Britain had for a hundred years been engaged in no war in which sea-power had been a paramount consideration, and her traditionalsympathy for the rights of peacefully-inclined nations had led her to agree to various encroachments on belligerent rights which, as a matter of fact, it wasto her interest, as the world&apos;s strongest naval Power, to retain.   Internationallaw recognised that a belligerent had the right to prevent, by means of warships,access to, or departure from, a portion of the enemy&apos;s coasts, but to be bindingthis blockade must be effective, and breach of a blockade of this type was the sole ground for the condemnation of ship and cargo.   International law as generally understood at the beginning of the twentieth century made no provisionfor a &quot;long distance&quot; blockade, for the examination of neutral mail on thehigh seas, for the diversion of neutral shipping for search, or for the seizure of enemy goods other than contraband carried under a neutral flag.    TheDeclaration of London of 1909 had shown so little appreciation of the realities of modern warfare as to include raw cotton, silk and wool, rubber, oil seedsand nuts, raw hides and metallic ores in the &quot;free list&quot; of commodities not susceptible of use in war.  The Declaration was not ratified by any of the major powers, but naturally the neutrals, including the Scandinavian countries andthe United States, tried after the outbreak of war to insist on its principles.Thus in 1914 the problem was to find the means not only of preventing economic assistance to Germany by neutrals, but also of securing the acquiescence of thelatter in these measures, in spite of the fact that they could quote at almost every point some pronouncement of international law against the practices in question.It was always necessary to consider how much the neutrals would endure and theextent to which their desire to avoid war would induce them to condone our action.3. A naval cordon was thrown across the Straits of Dover and the northernend of the North Sea, neutral ships were diverted forcibly or by agreement[29932] &apos; b
to control bases, and suspected cargoes were made liabie to condemnation afterproceedings in the Prize Court. The rationing of neutrals to amounts considered necessary for their requirements began in March 1915, and was subsequentlyextended until it became the basis of the whole blockade. Measures such as the black-listing of neutral firms trading with the enemy, and the withholding of bunker, insurance, credit and other facilities from unsatisfactory neutralswere increasingly employed. On the other hand, there were many concessions to neutral susceptibilities. In the early months of the war many goods ofmilitary value, such as cotton and wool, were allowed to pour into Germanythrough the northern neutrals. Enemy exports through neutral ports were notseized until March 1915. Cargoes were allowed to go forward to neutral portspending examination. The navicert system, whereby exporters could avoid riskof seizure by furnishing evidence of destination to the British Embassy in washington, was not introduced into the United States till 1916.4. The peace settlement, the League Covenant, and the inter-war periodproduced no effective change in international law, and from September 1939 toJune 1940 the situation, from the blockade point of view, was broadly similarto that of the earlier stages of the first war. In 1939, however, Russia, Italyand Japan were unfriendly neutrals, and the strong pro-Allied feeling in theUnited States did not prevent the reassertion of objections to British blockadepractices on the ground either that they were contrary to international law or that they were offensive to national dignity. On the latter ground both japan and the United States objected to the interception of neutral vessels -withinsome hundred miles of their territorial waters. Once again His Majesty&apos;sGovernment decided not to allow interference with neutral trade to be carriedto the point at which passive indignation would be replaced by positive counter-measures. As a result M.E.W.&apos;s hands were tied. The expedients of the last war were introduced as far as possible, with naval control in the North Sea,the Channel and the Mediterranean. Black-listing came into operation at once and a very comprehensive contraband list was published. Various devices suchas navicerts and holdback agreements were introduced to reduce neutral com-plaints. But forcible rationing was not adopted. Neutral imports were restrictedonly by agreement with neutral firms or Governments, which necessarily involvedcounter-concessions, or by evidence of the enemy destination of individual oon-signments. Interception was impossible in the Caribbean, the Pacific, or innorthern w-aters after January 1940. The great Italian liners, the Rex andConte de Savoia, were allowed to pass Gibraltar with only a nominal search.The control of enemy exports, instituted as a result of the Reprisals Order ofthe 27th November, 1939, was very leniently enforced for some months. Theexperience of those early months reinforced the lesson of the previous war thatthe effectiveness of the blockade weapon would be in inverse proportion to thestrength not only of enemy resources but also of neutral opposition. It is thereduction of this opposition to a minimum, rather than the discovery of new weapons, which explains the remarkable transformation in this side of theMinistry&apos;s work which took place after July 1940.5. At first sight the position after Dunkirk was disastrous. Germany haddirect control of the coastline of western Europe from the North Cape to thePyrenees. She had direct access to the Balkans and to Spain, varying degrees of control of the French colonies, and, with Italy, a commanding position in theMediterranean. The ample stocks seized in occupied countries filled up gapsin her reserves of raw materials, and she gained such additional assets as Lorraineiron-ore and Danish farming resources. Her man-power was strengthened byprisoners of war, and by slave labour from occupied countries. On the otherhand the British navy now had to patrol for blockade purposes the entire coastsof the continent, with the aid of only a small portion of the French navy, andit had to defend the country from invasion at the same time. During July&apos;1940there was an alarming increase in the volume of suspicious imports into spain and Portugal. The Contraband Committee repeatedly requested that these goods should be detained or seized, and the Admiralty could only reply that this couldnot be done save in exceptional cases.6. Many members of the Cabinet doubted whether a continuation of theblockade was possible, but new plans were devised, the general character of whichwas announced by the Ministers of Economic Warfare and Shipping on the30th July, 1940.   This was to rely not, as hitherto, on the examination of ships
and cargoes after they had been brought into our control bases, but to carry outinvestigations before the goods left their countries of origin. The three main features of the new plans were : (1) Compulsory navicerting. The navicert system had been introduced intothe United States in December 1939, but resort thereto was voluntary.It now became compulsory in the sense that we might seize goods,and possibly the ship carrying them, if a navicert were not produced on demand. The willingness of the United States Government afterJuly 1940 to acquiesce in this system, although official approvalcontinued to be&apos;withheld, made it possible for us to assume that ifgoods were not covered by navicerts there was a presumption of enemy destination. The weakness of the navicert system, even in the&quot; compulsory &quot; form, was that it was impossible to patrol the Atlanticadequately, and that it would certainly pay neutrals to attemptblockade running with valuable cargoes. It was necessary, therefore,to find means of putting pressure on shipowners who were notprepared to co-operate, and this was done through (2) Ship Warrants. This was a document issued to each ship whose owners had given undertakings to do what we wanted. Without such under-takings we were not prepared to give warrants to any ships of thesame ownership, which meant refusal of all facilities under british control, such as bunkers, dry-docking and repairing, insurance,stores, &amp;c. If a shipowner tried to run a cargo without navicertsthese facilities would be denied to all his ships, and in view of the dependence of neutral shippers on the widespread British-controlledfacilities this meant something much worse than inconvenience.(3) Compulsory Rationing. If Spain and Portugal, for instance, built uplarge reserves of oil and other war material, the temptation to theenemy to seize them might prove irresistible, and in the case of Spainthere might be a temptation to join in of her own accord. Rationswere therefore fixed which would be sufficient for normal requirementsonly.   This, in turn, made much easier the granting of navicerts.7. At the same time pre-emptive purchases were greatly increased and black-listing was extended. Our pre-emptive purchases, such as wolfram in spain and Portugal, chrome in Turkey, and ball-bearings in Sweden, were not100 per cent, successful, in that certain supplies of these immensely important commodities continued to be sent to the enemy, but the supplies available for thispurpose were greatly reduced and in this way the expenditure involved was justified. Listing proved a surprisingly powerful weapon. It seems to havebeen fear of the unknown post-war, rather than of the immediate consequences of listing which led many neutral firms to amend their ways; and there waswidespread reluctance to incur the stigma which attached to inclusion in the list. It was the listing of Messrs. Sulzer of Zurich, in spite of the violent protestsand appeals of the Swiss Government, which brought the latter to reason andenabled us to obtain really sweeping reductions in the supply of Swiss warmaterial to the enemy.8. It was the use of all these measures in combination, rendered possible by the psychological shock administered to transatlantic complacency by theGerman victories, which explains the success of the blockade after July 1940.There were other circumstances which helped to reduce neutral resistance almostto vanishing point. After the Soviet Union entered the war there were onlyfive European neutrals, and there was no Great Power among them. Spain, theneutral State in the best position geographically to provide a channel for imports to Germany, was in the throes of a severe economic crisis as an aftermath ofthe civil war, and dared not risk the cutting-off of vital supplies such as wheat and oil.9. It follows that where these favourable conditions did not apply theMinistry&apos;s policy was bound to fail, e.g., in the Pacific. Allied naval power was insufficient to allow any extensive system of control in Far Eastern waters. TheUnited States were not prepared to agree to the extension of the navicert area tothe Pacific, nor to allow interception of neutral ships taking cargoes through the carribbean from South American ports to Japan, where they might be used eitherto build up Japanese resources for war with Britain, or, before June 1941, for[29932] b 2
re-export to Germany through Vladivostok. The most that could be achievedwas the limitation of exports from the British Empire to Japan to normalquantities or less, thereby supplementing the limited American embargo policy.When the freezing orders against Japan were imposed by the British, UnitedStates and Netherlands Governments in July 1941 it was already too late to restrain her by economic pressure.10. By the end of 1940 the flow of goods across the Atlantic into neutral countries adjacent to the German-controlled area was under control, but a greatdeal of home-produced war material was going from these countries into Germany,partly because the profits were high, partly because they needed supplies fromGermany for their own economy, partly because they were afraid to refuse. AsSwedish iron-ore, Turkish chrome and copper, Iberian wolfram and Swissarmaments and precision instruments were native products we could prevent their export only by buying them ourselves, i.e., pre-emptive purchases or by some formof indirect pressure, such as withholding alternative supplies, or threateningpost-war consequences. The situation began to improve after the end of 1942.The increasing certainty of ultimate Allied victory in 1943 and 1944 made thefive remaining neutrals Sweden, Switzerland, Portugal, Spain and Turkey--less and less liable to retaliation by Germany, and therefore less able to offer this as an excuse for the sale of war material to her. A long series of negotiations was undertaken by M.E.W., and they resulted in the virtual cutting off&apos; of nearly all supplies from these countries to Germany by the end of 1944.11. This short account of the blockade during the present war will besufficient to show its possibilities and limitations. The combination of the threeweapons of compulsory navicerting, ship warrants and forcible rationing ispowerful and represents the culmination of the practical study of the blockadeweapon which had continued since 1914. It seems unlikely that new expedientsin this sphere can be devised or that they can be more effectively used than in theblockade of German-occupied Europe since the summer of 1940. But in the last resort the problem of blockade, and the extent to which the weapon can be used,is political, as the experience of the Ministry in conducting economic warfare inthe Pacific before December 1941 showed very clearly, and depends on the degreeof co-operation or acquiescence which can be exacted from neutrals. It is worthremembering that it was our blockade against Napoleon which led to war with theUnited States in 1812; and on the assumption that Japan was determined onaggression as soon as the right moment arrived, it is probably the case that thefinancial blockade of that country, which made it impossible for her to continuethe accumulation of war materials, left her no choice but to resort to arms withoutdelay.II.12. The development and improvement of bombing technique added a weapon of overwhelming power to Allied economic warfare. Indeed, during thelast two years of the war, it was bombing rather than blockade which became thechief instrument of economic warfare. M.E.W. can with justice claim a share in the bombing triumphs of the R.A.E. The vast mass of information accumulatedby the Economic Advisory Branch of M.E.W. on every aspect of the German war potential included the location, activities and output of every enemy factoryengaged in the production of war material and the purposes of each building in asingle installation. The whole of this information was placed at the disposal ofthe British and American bomber commands, who made the fullest use of it intheir operations. Of equal value to the Allied Air Forces were the assessment bythe E.A.B. of the relative value to the enemy of different war materials and types of armaments at any given time, and damage assessment, i.e., the translation of physical damage into terms which express its real effect on the enemy&apos;s war effort.13. As the Allies passed to the offensive, E.A.B. was called upon by the forces for information of every kind and description. Invading armies wanted to know the resources of the area in which they were to fight, its stocks of food and fuel,building materials, &amp;c. Prospective civil administrators made even widerdemands. This^has involved inter alia the production of economic surveys of countries and areas, running to several thousand printed pages and some hundreds of maps and plans. The economic contribution to inter-service strategic appre-ciations was made by M.E.W. through participation in the Joint Intelligencemachinery in London and overseas. At S.H.A.E.F., at S.E.A.C. and until recently at A.F.H.Q., intelligence sections led and partly staffed by M.E.W.
formed part of the intelligence organisation; and when the Board of Trade were preparing to ration clothing, it was from M.E.W. that they drew information onthe German system and experience.III.14. The Germans have publicly ascribed their defeat in 1918 to the Alliedblockade, and although this is by no means wholly true they took every precautionto prevent history repeating itself by laying in huge stocks, improving the rationing system, developing German agriculture and synthetic industries,especially oil, rubber and textiles, and experimenting in the use of substitutes.By these means, together with the loot and resources of conquered territories,Germany succeeded in avoiding defeat by hunger and maintaining her economicfighting power for five years. In the end, however, Allied economic warfare,i.e., blockade plus bombing, defeated German precautions. It caused the germans to employ in agriculture over one million more men and women than they hademployed in the last war, and it is a legitimate inference that this amount ofman-power was thereby diverted from the manufacture of munitions. It createdshortages of raw materials, including oil, rubber, ferro-alloys, copper, tin, wooland cotton, which inevitably reduced the efficiency of German industry and mustnecessarily have contributed greatly, though exactly to what extent cannot yet be estimated with any degree of accuracy, to the deficiencies which played an increasingly important part up to the end of the w^ar. German dependence on home production rendered German economy more vulnerable to bombing. Themost obvious instance of this is the synthetic oil plants. Von Rundstedt, who has stated that his Ardennes offensive came to a stop owing to lack of oil, gave oilshortage as one of the four major factors in Germany&apos;s collapse. It is a debatablepoint whether Hitler would have taken the fatal step of invading Russia, unless he had believed that shortages of vital raw materials would become progressively more acute, whereas, once installed in the Ukraine and the Caucasus, the germans could safely snap their fingers at the Allied blockade.IV.15. Human nature changes little, if at all, and whatever the outcome ofBretton Woods and San Francisco, there can be no certainty that the passionswhich led to wrar in 1914 and 1939 will not in years to come operate in the same way. By that time new discoveries and inventions may have rendered V2 andV3, to say nothing of precision bombing and pin pointing, as obsolete as bowsand arrows. The lines on which future wars may be fought and the nature ofthe armaments which may be used cannot be foretold. What can be foretoldwith some degree of certainty is that defeat may be averted and victory renderedswifter and less costly by a full and accurate knowledge of the enemy&apos;s war potential and more especially of his armaments potential. Forewarned oughtto mean forearmed and perhaps it is not too much to hope that the bitterexperience of the last six years will have at last taught British governments and the British public the folly, or worse, of neglecting the writing on the wall.16. I should like to suggest for the consideration of my colleagues therecreation of a small body, possibly reporting to a sub-committee of the C.I.D.,charged with the specific duty of collecting information regarding the war potential of foreign countries in the same way as did the Industrial IntelligenceCentre before the war, though possibly with added facilities. This body woulcldraw information not only from Government Departments such as the Board ofTrade, the Foreign Office, and the Intelligence Sections of the three Services,but would keep in close touch with the commercial, banking and insuranceworlds. From these circles speedy information ought to be obtainable even inpeace-time about commodity movements. In addition, the sub-committee ofthe C.I.D. would study new inventions and discoveries in relation to their possibleapplication to armaments. Developments and changes in the war potentialsof foreign countries and the conclusions and inferences to be drawn therefromwould be laid before the supreme authorities in a form wdiich would ensure notonly cognisance of the facts, but, where required, a decision as regards action.17. At the same time, the value of such a sub-committee of the C.I.D. asI envisage will depend largely on the attention paid to its appreciations andrecommendations by the  Cabinet,  the  Committee  of  Imperial  Defence  or
whatever supreme Defence Authority is created. This is a question of politics,but every endeavour should be made to ensure that my proposed sub-committeeand the staff working for it enjoy adequate prestige and facilities for statingtheir case.18. At the same time, either the sub-commitee of the C.I.D. and specialbody of officials which I have described, or some other similar organisationwithin the C.I.D., would keep a watchful eye on our own war potential. Inspite of the ever increasing clanger of war, our imports of many of the rawmaterials required for the manufacture of armaments such as copper, manganese,nickel and bauxite, and of other vital needs such as timber, remained during1938 and the first half of 1939 at practically the same level as in 1937 andprevious years. Pit-props are a noteworthy case in point. It was not till afterDunkirk, when the German submarine campaign was in full swing, that webegan to import these materials in great quantities and at vastly increased prices.In one instance only, that of crude oil, was any foresight shown, and this we oweto the Admiralty. It would be the duty of the sub-committee to prevent suchneglect of obvious precautions in future.
