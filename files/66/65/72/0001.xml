naval SITUATION.Northern Waters.1. During the week a convoy of 26 ships, escorted by ships of the home fleet, arrived in North Russia without incident.Home Waters.2. On the 17th H.M. ships Faulknor (destroyer) and Narborough (frigate)arrived at Plymouth from the Channel Islands, escorting six German mine-sweepers and two patrol boats. On the previous day troops had been put ashoreon Alderney, and the landing craft in which they had taken passage laterevacuated a party of Russian workers from the island. Sark was liberated onthe 17th. Some 20,000 German prisoners are being removed from the islands,and mines and other defensive equipment are being rendered safe.3. H.M.S. Berwick (cruiser) has visited Trondheim; H.M.S. Adventure(minelayer) has reached Cuxhaven, H.M. destroyers Zealous and Zodiac havereached Kiel and H.M. destroyers Southdown and Brocklesby have arrived willhelmshaven. H.M.S. Birmingham (cruiser) has left for Bergen, where thesituation had shown signs of getting out of hand. H.M.S. Diadem (cruiser) has reached Copenhagen.4. During the week . ending the 21st the combined British and U.S.discharges through the liberated ports of France and Belgium were approximately58,000 men, 4,700 vehicles, 313,500 tons of stores, 18,750 tons of coal and140,000 tons of petrol.German and Danish Ports.5. In the Cuxhaven area, whence a flotilla of H.M. minesweepers is now operating, large quantities of ammunition and explosives have been found; nearNordholz four oil cisterns were found to contain large quantities of valuablewar material (electric motors, amongst other things).6. A short examination of the Deschimag yard at Bremen located 16 U-boatsof type XXI on the slips : some of these were nearly complete. Also there were some incomplete one-man midgets.7. It is reported from the Denmark area that over 200 German mine-sweepers are available under the Flag Officer&apos;s command, and that it is intendedto employ these in clearing the Kattegat, the Belts and the Sound.A count of German merchant ships in the Denmark area has produced thefollowing total: 92 cargo ships, six hospital ships, two troopships, ninepassenger ships, and five tankers. There are also 70 smaller ships (under 800 tons),59 tugs, 11 floating cranes and two floating docks.8. Fifteen berths are available in locked basins at Bremerhaven; ten of them have crane facilities. At the Columbus Quay a tanker and a liberty ship can beberthed.9. A preliminary investigation of the Flensburg area has revealed in allsome 130 ships of miscellaneous types. These include one Narvik class destroyer,one ex-Norwegian torpedo-boat, about ten depot ships, 43 E-boats, 37 mine-sweeping craft of various types, and 12 torpedo recovery vessels. The merchant ships include five hospital ships, totalling about 17,000 tons, about 160 cargo ships totalling 187,000 tons, and some 40 tugs, water boats, diving vessels, cableships and ice breakers.Dutch Ports.10. At the Helder, investigation located 17 E-boats, ten minesweepers and nine river gunboats. Six berths varying from 400 to 1,650 feet are available, andthere are up to 30 berths in the Texel Road anchorage. Rotterdam is at presentopen to cargo shipping only, and the entrance is restricted by some 18 wrecks;these include 11 floating docks and the tanker Salome (13,400 tons). One18,000-ton floating dock, with its back broken, entirely blocks the entrance tothe Maashaven, in which the only grain silo is situated. Four large ships havebeen sunk across the Nieuwe Maas, leaving a channel of only 120 feet in width,through which a tidal stream flows at five or six knots. There are 45 berthsfor ships of which ten&quot; can berth on any one tide. There are three floating docks[29950] n
in working order (of 14.000, 8.000, and 4,500 tons) and also a graving dock650 feet in length. At Amsterdam it is hoped to clear a passage in the north sea Canal for coasters in three to four weeks and a passage for large ships ineight weeks. Three floating docks have been sunk in the harbour. Nearly150 cranes, elevators, and transporters have been destroyed on the quays, andin many cases these are obstructing berths; but in spite of all this, three largefloating cranes, 49 ordinary cranes, and over two miles of deep-water quays withtheir warehouses are intact, and the Naval yard is in working order. Thereare also three floating docks, of 7,500, 4,500 and 3,000 tons, in working order. AtIjmuiden eight sunken ships partly obstruct the entrance, but a gap of 320 feetexists with a minimum depth of 24 feet, on the north side. Entrance by largeships, though possible, would be hazardous, in view of the strong cross-current inthe entrance. Ten berths of 250 to 300 feet in length are available, and thereare six waiting berths at dolphins in the outer harbour. The harbour is now opento,ships of less than 22 feet draught. At Dordrecht some 30 large barges andferries have been sunk in the hope of impeding our traffic.East Indies.11. On the night of the 15th/16th four M.L.&apos;s destroyed eight armed supplycraft and killed 80 Japanese in the Irrawaddy Delta.An ML. on the Kokkowa River. 40 miles N.W. of Rangoon, sank five patrol craft full of Japanese.During recent patrols and while carrying out special operationsH.M. S/M Statesman sank three native craft and H.M. S/M Clyde sank a junk.Pacific.12. On the 16th and 17th aircraft of the British Pacific Fleet and on the22nd and 23rd aircraft of the IPS. Pacific Fleet bombed airfields and installations in the Sakishima group.13. On the 22nd and 23rd U.S. naval aircraft sank several small craftsouth of Tokyo and attacked barracks and shipping on and around Honshu.14. In the Philippines U.S. light craft have shelled Japanese shore positions on the east coast of Luzon. On the 14th coastal craft destroyed six JapaneseM.T.B.&apos;s in Davao Gulf, and next day the M.T.B. base on Pisa Point was shelledby U.S. destroyers.15. Allied warships have supported ground operations in the Wewak area,and light craft have shelled enemy positions on the east coast of Bougainville.The German Navy.16. The German Navy at the beginning of the war consisted of two battle-cruisers, three pocket battleships, two heavy and six light cruisers, 22 destroyers and 30 torpedo-boats. In addition she had 17 small motor torpedo-boats, afleet of 59 LT-boats, a minesweeping force including 14 new minesweepers and40 motor minesweepers and seven escort ships.Ships building and projected included four battleships (of which only theBismarck and Tirpitz were eventually completed), two aircraft carriers, neither of which was ever commissioned, and six cruisers of which only the Eugen becameoperational. The programme for smaller ships included 36 destroyers, about ten torpedo boats, 150-200 minesweepers and 300-400 E- and R-boats; about100 sperrbrechers were built from converted cargo ships.In April, 1945, before the final air blows were dealt at the remaining heavyships, the enemy had left to him one battle-cruiser, the Gneisenau, two pocketbattleships, Scheer and lutzow, two heavy cruisers, Hipper and Eugen, and threelight cruisers, nurnberg, Leipzig and Emden. He had lost during the war thebattleships Tirpitz and Bismarck, the battle cruiser Scharnhorst, the pocketbattleship Graf Spec, the heavy cruiser Blucher, and the light cruisersKarlsruhe and Konigsberg. During the last weeks of hostilities overwhelmingair power served to sink or put out of action the Scheer, Lutzow, Hipper,Emden and koln. The dismantled Gneisenau was captured at Gdyniaby  the Russians and  the Leipzig,  although  she managed  to escape from
Gdynia to Aabenraa, was not in operational state. Of the smaller surface ships,it was estimated in April that there remained some 23 destroyers (of which eightwere under repair), 22 torpedo-boats, about 120 minesweepers, about 30 sperr-brechers, about 25 escort vessels, 100-120 E-boats, 100-120 R-boats and about200 landing craft of various types. The Germans also had building at this timenine destroyers, 12 minesweepers, two escort ships, 15 landing craft and an unknown but probably substantial number of E- and R-boats. German losses in these categories during the war are estimated to have been approximately35 destroyers, 30 torpedo boats, 80 minesweepers, 70 E-boats, 70 R-boats, 50sperrbrechers and 10-15 minelayers.Of the U-boat fleet it is estimated that about 1,000 of the old standard types of boat were commissioned, and that of these over 600 were sunk by Allied sea and air forces. Construction of the old types was largely abandoned at the endof 1943 in favour of new pre-fabricated types. In spite, however, of the greatamount of labour and the highest priorities which were given to these new boatsit is believed that less than a hundred of them were ever completed and that ofthese only a very small number ever operated.U-Boats.17. There may be still up to a dozen U-boats at sea which have so far failedto surrender. One U-boat was scuttled off the Portuguese coast and 47 of her crew have been interned, and another was probably scuttled off Brunsbiittel.JJ.183 is reported to have acknowledged the German order to surrender whensouth of Mindanao (Philippines) and to be proceeding to Australia.Naval port parties report having found 35 U-boats in Bergen, 17 inKristiansand, nine in Stavanger and ten near Horten; all these are apparentlyin good order, but at Travemiinde 25 U-boats were found sunk or scuttled. two-boats were found sunk at Eckernforde.At Kiel 35 two-man midgets, 15 one-man midgets and about 100 one-mantorpedoes under construction have been located.Enemy Attack on Shipping.18. Appendix A sfuyws the number and tonnage of Allied and neutralmerchant ships lost through enemy action from the 3rd September, 1939, untilthe surrender of Germany on the night of the 8th/9th May, 1945. It will benoted that the British losses amount to considerably more than half the totalboth in ships and tonnage.Allied Minesweeping.19. Two flotillas of minesweepers, eight M/S trawlers, ten motor-mine-sweepers and eight M/S M.L.s are opening up channels to Trondheim, Bergen,Stavanger, Kristiansand and Oslo.In the Mediterranean 61 mines have been destroyed in the northern Adriaticand 15 off Genoa,The mine totals are 6,5&apos;87 ground and 10,029 moored.Ex-Enemy Shipping.20. From the 16th April to the 8th May 12 enemy ships totalling 72,902tons were lost through Allied action and 38 ships of 193,496 tons were damaged.From the beginning of the war until the surrender of Germany 3,083 enemy ships of 9,265,229 tons were destroyed or captured by tJhe Allies, of which 880ships totalling over 3,350,000 tons were German. From 1st March, 1941, tooth  May, 1945, 1,452 ships of 4,618,141 tons were damaged. Japanese casulties are not included in these figures.Between September 1939 and October 1944 German shipbuilding yards are estimated to have built some 46 cargo ships totalling 121,000 tons, which represents barely 3J per cent, of the amount of shipping known to have been lost to the enemy.   Nearly a third of the total production was built at Hamburg.The Norwegian authorities have asked for the return of about 1,000Norwegian ships, most of which are coasters, which have been employed by the&apos; Germans.[29950]
Corrigendum to Weekly Resume 297.Paragraph 10. The 4th line, instead of commencing &quot; The Hipper, &amp;c,&quot;should read : 1The Scheer lies capsized&apos; as a result of the attack by Bomber Command onthe 9th/10th April. The Hipper, previous to being sabotaged in dock, hadbeen hit by bombs and put out of action. The Emden had suffered a like fateand had to be beached.Attention is also drawn to Weekly Resume No. 293, paragraphs 15 and 39,and Weekly Resume No. 294, Appendix VII (under heading &quot; Kiel &quot;).Addendum to Weekly Resume 297.After paragraph 13. The actual cause of the damage to shipping in Kieland Hamburg Harbours as between bombing attacks and other causes cannot he regarded as final until further examination has been made.MILITARY SITUATION.Yenezia Giulia and Austria.21. The last week has seen the tension in Venezia Giulia and SouthernAustria somewhat eased, although the issue as to the former remains, at the timeof writing, unsettled.Marshal Tito has acceded to Pield-Marshal Alexanders request to withdrawYugoslav forces from Carinthia, and the evacuation is proceeding satisfactorily.With effect from the 21st May, the British-Yugoslav military boundary wasto be the Austrian frontier.In Venezia Giulia, Eighth Army has been reinforced by the transference of u.S. 2nd Corps to the Udine sector, and on the 22nd, a general eastward move-ment began, when British and American formations occupied several locationsS.E. and east of Gorizia, all without incident.The number of Yugoslav forces now in Venezia Giulia is round about 90,000.Burma.22. In the Irrawaddy Valley, advances have been made down the westernbank of the river. Mindon has been occupied. A bridgehead has also beenformed west of the river in the Padaung area. The link between columns of33 Indian Corps, advancing southwards down the road Prome-Rangoon, and26 Indian Division, advancing northwards from Rangoon, took place in theTaikkyi area on the 15th.4 Corps troops have advanced some 10 miles east of Toungoo along theroad Toungoo-Mawchi. against vigorous opposition. The mopping-up of smallisolated enemy parties attempting to escape to the east continues.Philippines.23. Luzon. In the Balete Pass area, 25 and 32 U.S. Infantry Divisionshave made small advances northwards against very heavy opposition. On theeast coast, leading troops of 1 U.S. Cavalry Division are now 2 miles S.W. ofInfanta.24.   Mindanao. 31 ITS. Infantry Division advancing from the south isnow within 20 miles of troops of 40 U.S. Infantry Division advancing from theCagayen area.    Small advances have been made by 24 U.S. Infantry Divisionnorth and west of Davao city-New Guinea.25. 6 Australian Infantry Division, advancing eastwards, has capturedCape Boram and reached a point 5 miles east of Wewak, where there is a Japanesebase and the last remaining enemy-defended point on the coast in the Wewakarea. Forward elements are now only 3 miles distant from the troops whichlanded 9 miles east of Wewak on the 12th.
Borneo.26. Tarakan. On the 15th, Dutch troops landed unopposed at the extremeS.W. tip of Tarakan Island. On the 17th, the Australians reached the east coast of the island and although the Japanese are still putting up a stiff resistance inthe interior, the main objectives of the operation, the airfield and the oilfields,have already been secured.Ryukyus.27. In Southern Okinawa, the enemy are resisting and counter-attackingwith increased ferocity and ground has changed hands at various parts along thefront. On the American left flank, 7 U.S. Infantry Division has capturedYonabaru, and occupied the high ground overlooking Itarajiku. The Japanesemade no effort to defend Yonabaru, which has been practically destroyed by american shelling.In the centre further progress has been made to the east and west of Shuri.On the right flank U.S. Marines are engaged in bitter fighting in suburbs of Naha.the capital of Okinawa. The line thus runs approximately east/west across the island some 10 miles from its southern end.AIR SITUATION.Europe.28.
