CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN EUROPE.I. At 0800 hrs. on the 5th May all German land, sea and air forces in holland, N.W. Germany including the Frisian Islands, Heligoland and all otherislands, also in Schlesvvig-Holstein and in Denmark, unconditionally surrendered to 21st Army Group.2. At 1200 hrs. on the 6th all German forces facing the Allied SouthernGroup of Armies surrendered unconditionally.3. At 0001 hrs. on the 9th all German land, sea and air forces in Europeunconditionally surrendered to the Allied Expeditionary Force and to the SovietHigh Command.NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.4.   Naval aircraft have attacked enemy shipping off the Norwegian coast.A convoy from North Russia has arrived in Home Waters without loss.The British Pacific Fleet has resumed operations&quot; against the Ryukyus.Twelve U-boats have probably been sunk and five possibly sunk.Norwegian Waters.5. In a recent attack on Kilbotn (N. of Narvik) by aircraft from H.M. shipsSearcher, Queen and Trumpeter (escort carriers) supported by ships of the home fleet, a German U-boat depot ship and a tanker were sunk and a U-boat was probably sunk; an A A ship was also damaged. One of our aircraft was destroyed and another is missing.Home Waters.6. During the week a convoy of 26 ships, escorted by ships of the home fleet, including H.M.C. destroyers Haida, Huron and Iroquois and the Norwegiandestroyer Stord. has arrived in Home Waters from North Russia without incident.7. During the night of the 7th/8th H.M. destroyer Cattistock intercepteda small German ship and escorted her into Ramsgate.On the 9th H.M.S. Prompt (minesweeper) was damaged by a mine off Ostend.The first two British ships carrying relief supplies to Holland left Ostendon the 5th to rendezvous with German escort vessels for Rotterdam.8. Coastal Command aircraft carried out damaging attacks on enemy shipping in the Kattegat and the Baltic during the last days of hostilities (seeAir Situation).9. During the first week of May the combined British and U.S. dischargeswere approximately 79,000 men, 7.100 vehicles. 347,000 tons of stores, 29,000 tonsof coal, 148.500 tons of petrol and 36,750 tons of ammunition.German and Danish Ports.10. At 1200 on the 8th the White Ensign was hoisted over the formerGerman Naval H.Q. at Kiel. The state of Kiel has proved worse than had been expected. The only warships still afloat are some small minesweepers, an E-boat and two depot ships. The Hipper has been sabotaged in dock, and the Emdenwas stranded and gutted. Some ten U-boats had been scuttled. In the harbourare ten tankers (of which seven are of more than 5,000 tons), 14 cargo ships ofover 2,000 tons, 53 smaller ships and two floating docks. The Kiel Canal isreported to be in working order except that a sunken U-boat blocks one of thelocks. The German Naval authorities at Kiel report that ships will shortly arrivethere from Swinemunde bringing 52,000 soldiers, 26,000 wounded and 53,000refugees.II. At Wesermiincle all the harbour installations are in good order, thoughlack of coal badly restricts public services. Some 180 cargo ships including the49,750-ton liner Europa,, which has been used as a barracks, are in the harbour.There is also one damaged destroyer in dock. The channel from the port is in good state.
12. At Cuxhaven, all port installations and ships are intact. Oil fuelreserve stocks amount to nearly 12.000 tons, but there is no coal. The german ships in the harbour comprise eight U-boats, two destroyers, 13 E-boats, 15 mine-sweepers, seven M/S trawlers, six sperrbrechers, four A/A ships, 29 harbourdefence A/A ships, one depot ship and other small craft. Several of the GermanM/S craft are being prepared for sea.13. Reports from Hamburg indicate that the town and docks area were muchdamaged by bombing, but that public services continue to function upon a limited scale. The part of the docks which had been provisionally chosen for military purposes will, however, be workable; at least 20 berths of up to 24 feet draughtare available and others can be used in other areas if there should be need ofthem. Cranes appear to be intact in sufficient number, and the power station is also undamaged; nor was there any serious demolition of quaysides. the shipyards had suffered extensive damage and it is said that no work had beendone in them for over two years. The only warships found afloat were threesperrbrechers, five fleet auxiliaries and a few small craft. Two sperrbrecherswere building, and there were also a number of unfinished U-boats of various types. The enemy had succeeded in sinking some 55 large or medium-sized ships,19 floating docks and nearly 600 small ships. Nevertheless at least 30 deepwaterberths are clear of wrecks, though they may of course have been obstructed inother ways. The ships ready for sea include Dutch, Norwegian and Frenchcargo ships but no tankers were found; the Germans explain that most of thelarger ships had been sent to the Baltic ports in order to evacuate refugees.About a hundred and forty dock and river pilots are available and ready to work.Stocks of coal, coke, and oil fuel are reported to be very low. Fifteen Germanberthing tugs have been requisitioned and sixty others are held in reserve.14. Reports from Emden state that everything there is under control andthat the Naval authorities are proving co-operative. Some 25 minor warshipswere found in the port, but there were no U-boats and no minesweepers. Allmining charges have been removed from the quays. For lack of any recentdredging, it is thought that for the moment only ships of up to 21 feet will be acceptable.15.   At Lubeck all port facilities are in good condition, but in Lubeck Bay.many U-boats, E-boats and other ships and craft have been scuttled; the approachchannel is clear, however, and has been buoyed.16. Sweeping of our own channel from the Humber to the Elbe is nowalready well advanced, and ocean light-buoys are being laid along it.17. In the harbour at Copenhagen there are the Eugen and N timber g, three destroyers and two torpedo-boats; in addition there are some 11 minesweepers,13 sperrbrechers, 19 armed trawlers, and. two armed cargo ships; some 35 cargo ships, 27 passenger ships, 13 trawlers, 20 cutters, four large hospital ships and various small craft were found in good state in the harbour. The hospital ships and passenger ships are full of wounded and refugees from the Baltic- about20,000 persons in all.18. H.M. ships Birmingham, Dido (cruisers), Zephyr, Zealous, Zest,Zodiac, Zambesi and Carysfort (destroyers) reached Copenhagen on the afternoon of the 9th, and at 1800 on that day the port was formally handed over to theAllies, and at once returned by them to the Danes.Mediterranean.19. On the 4th, an Italian U-boat and seven German E-boats arrived atAncona to surrender. The next day two lighters, one small tanker and an unarmedschooner reached Ancona under escort. In all, 23 enemy craft, from which 1.321prisoners were taken, were reported on the 5th to have surrendered at that port.A midget U-boat reached Venice from Eola on the 5th and two others are believed to have been mined en route.20.   During the night of the 1st/2nd a successful commando raid wasmade by troops of a Greek &quot; Sacred &quot; Squadron on Rhodes and Alimnia.Destroyers covered the landing and H.M. destroyer Catterick shelled enemy, positions:
On the 5th an enemy caique was wrecked while on passage from Rhodesto Crete and 745 prisoners were rescued from this craft. The following nighta caique with twelve Fascist Italians was captured near Patmos.21. At Genoa it is reported that berths for ten liberty ships and threecoasters are now available. Minesweeping operations in the approaches to theport, which had been held up by bad weather, have now begun.22. The Commercial Harbour at Venice is reported to be in very good condition, but the port and approaches are believed to have been carefully mined.The only damage at Trieste is that caused by Allied bombing; berthing facilities are reported to be very good.23. On the 5th. H.M.S. Coriolanus (danlayer) was mined and sunk whilesweeping the channel from Ancona.East Indies.24.   The clocks at Rangoon are reported to be in fair condition and someof ELM. ships were expected to enter the inner harbour on the 6th.A tank landing craft was mined off Rangoon on the 3rd.Pacific.25. During Japanese counter-attacks on Okinawa several heavy aircraftattacks were made on Allied ships, some of which were damaged. A large numberof enemy aircraft were destroyed.In support of the operations on Okinawa the British Pacific Fleet shelledand bombed airfields and other targets on Miyako Island in the Sakishima group on the 4th and 5th. Twenty Japanese aircraft in four groups attacked ourcarrier force; three suicide aircraft and eight others were destroyed. FT.M.S.Formidable (fleet carrier) was damaged but shortly afterwards was again opera-tional. During the two days of these operations a total of 18 Japanese aircraft were destroyed. British carrier-borne aircraft continued the attack on the 9th,and during a Japanese air attack on the British Fleet two ships were slightly damaged.26.   On the 4th a U.S. submarine sank two tankers off the island of Kyushu.27. In Borneo the landing on Tarakan was preceded by a heavy bombard-ment by H.M.A. warships. Surveying the passages to the shore was carried outby H.M.A.S. Lachlan (survey ship).Anti-Submarine Operations.28. During the week 46 attacks on U-boats were reported, of which 32 wereby shore-based aircraft, three by carrier-borne aircraft and 11 by warships.Coastal Command aircraft operating in the Kattegat and in the Great and little Belts have probably sunk three U-boats and possibly two others. Liberatorsoperating in the Kattegat have probably sunk five U-boats and possibly sunkanother. Naval aircraft probably sank one off Ffarstad (see paragraph 5).U.S.S. Atherton (destroyer) probably sank one off jews York. On the 2nd it was reported that two U-boats had scuttled at the entrance to Tracemiinde, and onthe 4th another was reported to have been destroyed off Kiel. On the 5th aircraftreported a U-boat beached in the Kattegat.29. From the 1st December, 1944, until the end of April 1945, 81 midgetU-boats have been captured, sunk or probably sunk, and 28 have been possiblvsunk.Enemy Attack on Shipping.30. During the week two ships in coastal convoy were sunk by a U-boat inthe Firth of Forth, and a U.S. ship was torpedoed and sunk off New York. one ship in convoy was torpedoed off Reykjavik but reached port. A U.S. ship in convoy was damaged probably by a mine off Ostend.31. Shipping losses by enemy action in April amounted to 19 ships of104,260 tons. With the addition of marine casualties the total of losses fromall causes amounted to 28 ships of 132,412 tons. Thirteen ships of 72,957 tons were sunk by U-boats.   Of these, eight were sunk in UK. coastal and adjacent

TheHesia Pass also was reached on the 6th. Further east, Salzburg was entered onthe 4th. Since the surrender on the 6th of the German Armies facing them, the advance of the Southern Group of Armies has continued, and by the 9th U.S.troops had consolidated on the general line of the Rivers Inn and Salzach fromLandeck to Salzburg.Central Sector.37. On the right of the Third U.S. Army, progress into Central Austriacontinued during the week. Linz was taken on the 5th, and by the 9th only some40 miles of the Danube Valley separated leading elements from Russian troopswest of Vienna. In Czechoslovakia, the left of this Army captured Pilsen onthe 6th, and three days later U.S. forces were within 70 miles of Prague after a steady advance on a two corps front against moderate opposition.There has been little to report from the fronts of the First and Ninth U.S.Armies.

The swift Russian advance along the Baltic coast north and N.W.of Berlin had by the 3rd brought the Russians up to the line Wismar-Wittenbergewhere they linked up with the Western Allies.The Russians then followed up this success on the 5th by clearing the areaof Swinemunde and on the following day by capturing the island of Ruegen.West and N.W. of Brandenburg they pressed on against scattered german resistance and on the 7th they reached the River Elbe north and S.E. ofMagdeburg.Steady Russian progress was made during the first part of the w*eek in theMoravska-Ostrava and Brno areas, compelling the Germans to withdraw fromtheir salient east of the Morava Gap. Breslau, long encircled, was finally taken on the 7th.On the 8th Russian forces made large advances on all fronts on whichfighting was still taking place. Dresden was captured along with many other places to the west and south; the town of Olomouc was taken and considerableadvances were made to the north and west of it, and in Austria progress to thewest took the Russians beyond Znaim.Following the announcement of general surrender all fighting in Latvia andthe Danzig Bay pockets has ceased, and Russian troops have moved in and occupied the port of Libau.On the rest of the Eastern and South-Eastern Fronts, the German high command stated that it had received no reports on the situation of the ArmyGroups; according to the Russians, however, German troops in Czechoslovakiaare hurriedly retreating to the west.Russian advances in these areas during the 9th have now liberated Pragueand in Austria have completed the link-up with the Western Allies in the Danubovalley S.E. of Linz.
