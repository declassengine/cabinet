MENT IS THE PROPERTY OFANNIC MAJESTY*S GOYERNiVPrinted&apos;for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.The cirsuiaiion of this paper-       :   &apos; ; iiHiiioy!   &apos; ii tW.P. (45) 254.13tA 4pn7, 1945.WAR CABINET.JAPANESE CABINET CRISIS.Memorandum by the Secretary oe State for Foreign Affairs.I THINK my colleagues may be interested to read the attached memorandum,prepared in the Foreign Office, on the subject of the recent Cabinet crisis in Japan.Foreign Office, 13th April, 1945.THE fall of the Koiso Cabinet on the 5th April hardly came as a surprise.It is surprising rather that the Cabinet succeeded in lasting as long as it did inthe face of one military disaster after another from the very day of its formation.2. In the Japanese system there is a visible Administration (the cabinet of the moment) and an &quot; invisible &quot; one consisting of such powerful figures asex-Prime Ministers, the Chiefs of the General Staff, the small coterie of officials of the Imperial Household, and leading members of the Zaibatsu or economicoligarchy. These two organisms, the visible and the &quot; invisible,&quot; constantly actand react upon one another, especially in the matter of sharing responsibilityfor difficulties or set-backs of any kind. The Cabinet is formally responsible forthe conduct of affairs, but in the face of set-backs a point is always reached wherethey decide that responsibility must be shared by their colleagues behind thescenes. When this point is reached they resign and retire behind the scenesthemselves. The ex-Prime Ministers (including the one who has just resigned)then deliberate with one or two officials of the Imperial Household and recommenda new Prime Minister to the Emperor. The new Prime Minister thereuponconsults various members of the &quot; invisible&quot; Administration and from themselects his Cabinet, who step forward to accept formal responsibility for thefurther conduct of affairs. The Army and Navy Ministers are always nomineesof the General Staff.3. That is what has happened on this occasion. The Koiso Administrationhave been formally responsible for the loss of Saipan, of Manila, of Iwojima, forthe defeat in Burma, for the heavy bombing of Japan and for the attack onOkinawa. They have had enough; more in fact than any Japanese cabinet has ever had before, and it was inevitable that they should invoke the processdescribed in the preceding paragraph.4. There is no need to look any further for an explanation, and it can be stated with confidence that there is nothing in the theory, favoured by manyAmerican and British newspapers, that the fall of the Koiso Cabinet was broughtabout by the Russian denunciation of the Russo-Japanese Neutrality Pact of 1941.5. The new Prime Minister, Admiral Baron Kantaro Suzuki, a veteranof 77, has not previously held political office but has been since 1929 closely associated with the Imperial Household.   Military fanatics attempted to murderA. E.[29713]
him in 1936. He is known as a man of high character and level-headed views,which has led to a certain amount of press speculation here and in the UnitedStates that he may attempt to make peace. His Cabinet, which was formallyconstituted on the 7th April, is far from being an impressive body. The onlyprominent figures in it are Admiral Yonai, a former Prime Minister who continuesto hold the office of Navy Minister which he held in the Koiso Cabinet,Mr. Shigenori Togo, who resumes the post of Foreign Minister which he held inthe Tojo Cabinet at the time of Japan&apos;s entry into the war, and General Minami,an extreme jingo of the Kwantung Army School who becomes a Minister without portfolio. It is noteworthy that the only other general included is the Ministerof War, who must be a general on the active list, but the person chosen,. GeneralAnami, is not particularly well-known.  A biographical list is attached (Annex I).6. The change of Cabinet has brought no weakening of the military controlover Japan. Just before General Koiso resigned the sole political party, the&quot; National Government Aid Association,&quot; was reorganised as the &quot; Great JapanPolitical Association,&quot; under the presidency of General Minami, who may bedepended upon to watch over the nation as a drill sergeant over his platoon. Simul-taneously with the setting up of the new Cabinet it was announced that Field-Marshals Sugiyama and Hata had been entrusted with the defence of theJapanese mainland and it has since been announced that General Doihara, one ofthe leading spirits in the &quot; Manchurian Incident &quot; of 1931, has been appointedDirector-General of Military Education.7. It is premature to speculate whether the new Cabinet has been chargedwith the task of seeking peace. There must be many of the wiser heads in Japanwho realise very clearly that she made a fatal mistake in going to war and thatdefeat is inevitable. But even they would choose to continue fighting rather thanaccept unconditional surrender which included the occupation of Japan itself.The Allies have made no secret of their intention to occupy Germany and theJapanese must conclude that there is a similar intention to occupy Japan. Theyhave not yet suffered a military defeat disastrous enough to make such a prospecttolerable. Therefore, even if Admiral Suzuki were to seek peace it is to beexpected that he would abandon the attempt as soon as he learnt authoritativelythat Japan would be required to submit to Allied occupation. The Japaneseattitude seems to be well described in the Swedish report contained in Stockholmtelegram No. 584.   (Annex II.)8. Admiral Suzuki is reported to have delivered the following broadcastmessage on the 8th April :  &quot; I have accepted the Emperor&apos;s orders to form a Cabinet at a time whenthe nation finds itself faced with an unexpected crisis. Military developmentsdo not allow of any optimism. There is only one way out of the present situation the concentration of the nation&apos;s total strength so that the enemy will haveto fight a united front of 100 million people. I am convinced that we shallsucceed in crushing the enemy if we fight on with the courage of despair andbravely face death. Conditions at home will be adapted to conform with themilitary situation. All measures for the defence of the country will be carriedout rapidly and at the same time the Administration will be reorganised so thateveryone of all ages can take part in the war.&quot;There is no reason to believe that this statement does not represent AdmiralSuzuki&apos;s real determination.ANNEX I.Imperial Japanese Cabinet. &apos; (Formed 7th April, 1945.)Premier.Admiral (retired) Baron Kantaro Suzuki. Admiral Baron Kantaro Suzukiwas born in December 1867. He graduated from the Naval Staff College, and,according to a biography issued by the Japanese News Agency Domei on the5th April, he served with distinction in the Sino-Japanese War of 1895 and the russo--Japanese War of 1904.

He retired from active service in 1929 and was appointed Grand Chamber-lain to the Emperor. In his Personalities Report of 1936 Sir Robert Clive statedthat Baron Suzuki was selected for this post, which brought him into constantand close contact with the Emperor, because of his high moral character anddevotion to the Imperial family. The report added that he was very muchrespected by everyone but was rather silent and of a retiring nature.Admiral Suzuki was one of the men marked for assassination by theMilitarists who revolted on the 26th February, 1936, against the &quot; Liberal &quot;tendencies of that day.

Mallet to Mr. Eden.- (Received 7th April.)(No. 584.   Top Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Stockholm, 6th April, 1945.I WAS to-day given the substance of a telegram from the Swedish Ministerat Tokio received here the 4th April.2. He reported that to the Japanese mind the idea of unconditional surrender is unthinkable as it would be dishonourable and would lead to desperateacts by many people. The Japanese would, however, now be prepared to acceptvery far-reaching conditions as a result of negotiated peace. They realise thatthe war is lost but still believe it will be impossible for the Allies to occupy Japan.3. The idea that there could be a change in the constitution affecting theposition of the Emperor can be excluded. The Emperors position cannot betouched. The suggestion mooted in America by the Institution of Pacific Relationsthat1 the Emperor and family should be set aside has created a very bad impressioneven among those who are most in favour of ending the war.
