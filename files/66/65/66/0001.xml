THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1945.SECRET. /    Copy No.W.P. (45) 316.imh May, 1945.WAR CABINET.PUBLICATION OF FURTHER STATISTICS OF THE UNITEDKINGDOM WAR EFFORT.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.I suggest that it is important to release one or two sets of round figures aboutthe British war effort while the world is still thinking and talking about VE-day.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs has recently confirmed from his experience in the United States how little general knowledge Americans have about the size of the British contribution to victory in relation to their own andto that of Russia. A few figures in continuation of those given in the white paper on &quot; Statistics relating to the War Effort of the United Kingdom &quot; are needed at once. I would ask the War Cabinet to authorise the release of thefollowing : 1. Casualties.(i) In the normal course there would be a quarterly announcement of Servicecasualties at the end of next June, covering United Kingdom, commonwealth and Empire casualties up to the end of this month. I believe that figures for united Kingdom Service casualties up to the end of April are now available,and I propose that they should be issued at once. I understand that figures forthe total of Commonwealth and Empire casualties will not be so readily available.Their special release would in any case require the consent of Dominion Govern-ments, and so I propose that these should be left to come out at the normal time.(ii) I understand that figures for merchant seamen casualties covering shipson United Kingdom register are available up to the end of March 1945. Similarfigures up to an earlier date were given in the Statistical White Paper. I urge that the figures down to March 1945 should be released now.(iii) Civilian casualties for the whole period of the war have already been released.The result of the release of these combined figures would be to give a totalof more than 900,000 for United Kingdom war casualties. This is an effectivefigure of which good use can be made.2. Warships and Bier chant Ships.I propose that the figures should be published for (a) the total numbers ofNaval vessels (from battleships to mosquito craft) in commission on VE-day, and(b) the total number and gross tonnage of all merchant ships flying the british flag at that date.Figures of this kind would be a great help in catching the eye of the public,especially overseas, and in impressing them with an idea of the magnitude of our naval effort.3. A rmed Forces.Though all releasable figures are useful to make up the whole picture, I thinkthat the most striking single figure that could be given at the present momentwould be the total number of man-years served by members of the Armed forces from September 1939 to VE-day.    I understand that this figure has beenT29930]
calculated to be in the region of 20,000,000. I should like to have it provided onthe authority of the Central Statistical Office and to be authorised to make itpublic.I bring these matters of detail to the attention of the War Cabinet not because of any lack of assistance from the various Departments concerned,but because the publication of such figures has been affected by considerations ofpolicy during the currency of war in Europe so that they can hardly now be cleared without the highest authority.B. B.Ministry of Information,IMh May, 1945.
