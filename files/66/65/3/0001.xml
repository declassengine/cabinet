Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 253.lbth April, 1945.Copy No.WAR CABINET.LEAVE FOR SERVICE PERSONNEL ON THE  CESSATION OFHOSTILITIES WITH GERMANY1. It was announced on the 4th April that in Government factories and inthe Government service generally the day of the European Cease-Fire, togetherwith the day immediately following, should be regarded as days of paid holiday.There would also be an additional day of paid holiday at some later date. It isthe intention that Industry should follow suit.2. Many of the considerations which led to this decision apply also to theServices. Unless Service men and women are given some measure of extra leave,the fact that civilians are to get a special holiday will create ill-feeling and a sense of injustice; and the widespread absences without leave which would result would have a serious effect on morale and discipline.3. It is clear that everyone in the Services cannot be sent on special leaveimmediately after the cessation of hostilities with Germany; nor would this bedesirable in view of the numbers serving outside the United Kingdom.4. I therefore invite the War Cabinet to approve arrangements for theServices on the following lines : (a) A special addition of 48 hours to normal privilege leave to celebratevictory against Germany should be authorised.(&amp;) Privilege leave within the limits of normal entitlement (but with thespecial addition under (a) ) should be granted as soon-after VE Dayas can be arranged. But not more than a given proportion of anyUnit would be allowed to be away at one time; and the numbersallowed to proceed on leave would have to be adjusted, in the UnitedKingdom, to the public transport available and, overseas, to the capacity of the rest and leave camps. These arrangements should besubject to overriding operational considerations, such as the require-ments of occupational forces, the need to maintain trainingoutputs, &amp;c.(c) Commanding Officers should be instructed, again subject to operationallimitations, to give personnel a &quot; day off &quot;&quot;with the unit where this is practicable, this &quot; day off &quot; not to count against leave entitlement.(d) A public statement should be made as soon as possible and given the widest publicity explaining why the Services cannot be treated on allfours with civilians, and what is to be done for them, i.e. (a)-(c) above.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry,lQth April, 1945.[29726]
