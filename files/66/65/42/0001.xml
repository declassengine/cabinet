///Printed for the War Cabinet, May, 1945W.P. (45) 29210th May, 1945.SECRETLOPYNo. 3 war CABINETEMPLOYMENT OF GERMAN PRISONERS OF WAR OUTSIDEGERMANY AFTER THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN europe memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. At their 23rd (44) meeting on 14th December, 1944, the A.P.W. committee decided that any Germans compulsorily employed outside Germany after the cessation of hostilities should be prisoners of war and invited me to consult with the other Depart-ments concerned in order to ascertain the probable United Kingdom requirement for german labour outside Germany, both in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.2. I have now received from the Departments concerned estimates of the numbersof German prisoners of war whom they will wish to employ in the United Kingdom.These estimates total 730,000 and are shown in detail at Appendix A. Apart from this number required for labour in the United Kingdom, some additional 150,000 arerequired for labour purposes overseas, of whom 60,000 are needed for purposes con-nected with the war against Japan and the balance for the replacement of italian prisoners of war now employed in the Middle East and elsewhere outside the UnitedKingdom.3. I attach at Appendix B tables showing as at 31st March, 1945, the numbers ofGerman and Italian prisoners of war (a) detained in the United Kingdom, the Dominionsand British controlled territories, and (b) those at present employed in the countriesshown. It will be seen that there were in the United Kingdom at 31st March, 160,000German prisoners of war of all ranks, of whom about 40,000 were employed. On thesefigures it will be necessary to bring an additional 570,000 Germans to this country tomeet departmental requirements. This seems to me quite out of the question. Theproblems of movement, feeding, accommodating and guarding such numbers makes any proposals to meet the present demands quite unrealistic.4. I feel, therefore, that the problem must be approached from a different angle.I think we should agree on certain principles regarding the employment of german prisoners of war in the United Kingdom and other British territories outside Germanyafter the cessation of hostilities, and then see how many German prisoners of war couldbe employed if those principles are observed.5. I suggest that the following should be the governing principles in the matter:  (i) for the present Germans already in this country, whether they are now workingor not, should be retained here and every effort should be made to put themaximum number to work;(ii) political considerations will lead to the repatriation as soon as transport is available of all Italian prisoners of war held in this country and in othercountries under British control. German prisoners of war should replace those Italians who are working in the U.K., the Middle East or other Britishcontrolled territories;(iii) we must obtain the number of German prisoners of war approximately 60,000 needed by our military authorities for labour purposes in connection withthe war against Japan ;(iv) the employment of German prisoners of war in the United Kingdom should not involve (a) billeting, (b) building fresh accommodation requiring materialsneeded for other building work, (c) the holding back from release to civil life of any appreciable number of soldiers for guard duties. It is a questionof degree what numbers of soldiers can be retained for such duties without giving rise to political difficulties.
6. If the above principles are agreed, it remains to decide on what basis we shouldselect the additional German prisoners of war needed out of the immense numbersavailable.   .1 suggest that the following should be the governing considerations:  (i) if we require men with special skill, we should take them;(ii) subject to (i), we should employ Nazis. Admittedly there is some difficultyin this from the security angle and the larger guard commitment involved;on the other hand, to release Nazis would cause political difficulties here and in Germany: to retain them without making them work would be equally indefensible; *(hi) in order to ease the movement problem, additional prisoners of war requiredfor the United Kingdom should be obtained from S.H.A.E.F&apos;s. theatre, andthose required for the war against Japan, the Middle East and adjacentBritish controlled countries, should be drawn from the Italian theatre.7. If the principles regarding our requirements (in paragraph 5) and the selection of the numbers needed (in paragraph 6) are agreed, the calculation of the additionalnumbers of prisoners of war we can take in for work both in this country and outsideGermany, should be considered by an interdepartmental committee with a knowledgeof the technical points involved.8. There is one further point of principle of considerable importance, namely, theextent to which we are to meet any requirements which may be put forward by theDominions, India and our various Allies for German prisoners of war labour purposesoutside Germany. So far as the Dominions and India are concerned, I think we shouldlet them know the principles we propose to follow and ask them whether they require any German prisoners of war from those we hold. So far as the Russians are concerned,there are obvious political objections to transferring our prisoners of war to them, andI think we might take the line that Russia can meet her needs from her own prisoners and her own zone. On the other hand, should the Belgians, Dutch or Norwegians, forexample, ask for prisoners of war to help restore the damage done in their countries,it would be difficult to refuse them, and in principle I suggest we should meet them.9. To sum up I invite the War Cabinet:  (i) to agree to the principles suggested in paragraphs 5 and 6 above regarding the assessment of our requirements of additional German prisoners of war for labour purposes for the United Kingdom and British controlled territories,and their selection from the mass of Germans now available;(ii) to approve the appointment of a special interdepartmental committee underthe chairmanship of a representative from the Ministry of Labour, to deter-niine in the tight of those principles the numbers of German prisoners of war we require for labour purposes in the United Kingdom and other Britishcontrolled territories and to arrange for the issue of necessary instructions toS.C.A.E.F. and S.A.C.M.E.D. through the appropriate channels;(hi) to determine what our attitude should be to requirements which may be putforward by our Allies for German prisoners of war to be employed in theirown countries;(iv) to agree that the Dominions and the Government of India should be notified of our policy in this matter and asked whether they will require any additionalGerman prisoners of war beyond those they already hold for labour purposes(whether to replace Italians or not) and if so, how many.P. J. G,The War Office,io//z May, 1045.*Note. The principle suggested in paragraph 6(ii) above fits in with the policies suggested byGeneral Eisenhower in SCAF 228 and 308, and approved by the Combined Chiefs of Staff. In theformer cable he stated his intention to treat the vast number of German troops surrendering shortly before and immediately after the defeat of Germany, as disarmed German troops pending discharge,who should be administered and maintained by the German Army under the supervision of the allied forces. War criminals and other categories of wanted German personnel, and those required on security grounds, were not to be treated in this way. Similarly, in SCAF 308, the policy was laiddown that in order to meet the acute shortage of labour in Germany and thus minimise the likelihood of starvation and disease during the coming winter, selected prisoners of war after careful screeningshould be released from camps for employment in agriculture, coal mining and transportation,whilst retaining their prisoner of war status. The principle I have suggested would permit the releasefor labour in Germany of the non-Nazis amongst German prisoners of war, whilst employing the nazis on work outside Germany where they are unlikely to be in a position to cause any trouble,and may conceivably, in the course of time, come to see the errors of their ways.
