(45) 307.16th May, 1945.WAR CABINET.THE  NAVY&apos;S MAN-POWER REQUIREMENTS  FOR  THE  period JUNE TO 31st DECEMBER, 1945.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.COMMENCING on the 18th June, 1945, the Navy in common with the other two Services will begin to reduce its overall strength and men and women willbe released in accordance with the Re-allocation Plan. The releases will be ata slow rate initially as a considerable amount of re-deployment of the Navy&apos;spersonnel is necessary. Many of the escort vessels hitherto employed in home waters are destined for the East and their crews must be re-formed withmen who are not due for release till later. Some of the redundant escort vesselshave to be prepared for reserve while others must be destored prior to being laid up or scrapped. This process will take time and wall involve many changesin personnel. We are also considerably in arrears with our requirements for officers and ratings on the East Indies and Pacific Stations, and we still havesubstantial commitments for supplying the Armies of Occupation. Until allthese requirements have been met, and the operating and maintenance bases in home waters have been paid off, only a limited number of men will become available to relieve those who are due for release in the early Age and ServiceGroups.2. It is understood that in the period of 18 months following the cessation of hostilities in Europe the Army will be reducing its strength by about 50 percent, and will be releasing a million and a half men, and that the War Officeintend to do this by releasing a definite number of Age and Service Groupsthroughout all branches and categories. Owing to the requirements for navalwarfare in the Pacific, the reduction which can be made in the strength of theNavy will be relatively very much less, and further it will be quite impossibleto release an equal number of Age and Service Groups throughout the various branches of the Navy. This is provided for in the Re-allocation Plan. In someof the bigger branches such as the Seaman branch, owing to the fortuitous dis-tribution of the Age and Service Groups it is likely that we will be able to go further than the Army, but in many of the other branches it will be extremelydifficult to release even the earlier groups. The position with regard to officers will be even more difficult.Numbers which may be released from the Navy.3. During the next 12 months, it is estimated that, after allowing forwastage and for other factors, the Royal Navy will be able to release about167,000 men and 20,000 women, without replacement, when reducing to theminimum strength required for the Japanese campaign as at present planned.For the reasons given in paragraph 1, releases will initially be at a relatively-slow rate but it is expected that about 90,000 men will be released by the endof 1945.[29909J
Total       ...............      17,250* This requirement is calculated after full allowance has been made for the maximumrecruitment of Italian labour.Replacement of men to be released in Class B.10. Under the terms of the Re-allocation Plan men to be released underClass B are to be replaced by new entries. If during.the 12 months following the defeat of Germany 167,000 men are released from the Navy in Class A, an3,9001,60075011,000*New allocations required to make good deficiencies.4. Despite the fact that the Navy will be reducing- its strength, newallocations of man-power in the period the 1st June to the 31st December, 1945,will be essential. The principal reason is that the composition of the personnel of the Navy required for the Japanese war is very different from what it hasbeen while * our main forces have been deployed in Home Waters and in the atlantic and Mediterranean. When operating in these areas, the support andmaintenance of the fleet and of its attendant craft, and the construction ofairfields and of accommodation on shore for personnel and for stores have beencarried out largely by civilian labour provided by the dockyards and shipyardsand by civilian constructional services. These civilians cannot be moved to theEast except as members of a uniformed service, and so they become a charge against Vote A. It will, therefore, be necessary to recruit a number of skilled men and technicians who cannot be found by any process of remustering andretraining within the Navy.5. Apart from these men, the Naval Air Arm has not yet reached its peak of expansion and requires further entries, while in other branches, such as RadioMechanics, Engine-room and Electrical Artificers and Mechanics, Royal MarineEngineers, &amp;c, the additional equipment now provided and the special conditionsof the war in the Pacific call for expansion.6. Another reason is that in several branches of the Navy other than theSeaman, Stoker and Royal Marines, there are considerable shortages, and, further-more, a high proportion of the men now serving are in the Age and ServiceGroups due for early release, some 17,000 of them being men over 50 in Age and service Group 1. Unless, therefore, new entries are provided, few, if any, releasescan take place in certain branches, and the Military Needs Clause will have to be invoked to a greater extent than is desirable for the well-being of the Navy,particularly as the men who wrould be retained would be those with long records of service in the Royal Navy in peace and war.7. This situation was foreseen, and throughout the last year or moreendeavour has been made to strengthen these branches by remustering andretraining suitable men from other branches. It has not, however, been possibleto restore a proper balance by these methods and the repeated cuts applied to theNavy&apos;s man-power allocations in the last 18 months have not allowed sufficiententries to be made. New entries are, therefore, essential now for the expresspurpose of restoring the balance.8. For the above reasons it is necessary to ask for a minimum newallocation for the Royal Navy of 40,000 men for the period the 1st June to the31st December, 1945. This is over and above&quot; the transfer of the balance of the17,200 men from the R.A.F., which was approved to take place after the german war when the allocations for the first half of 1944 were decided at the end of 1943.9. This new allocation need not come entirely from civilian sources, astransfers of the following trained specialists from the Army would be acceptable(even though this may preclude the Army from releasing men from these Corps tothe same level of Age and Service Groups as in other branches of the Army), pro-vided they are men in Age and Service Groups eligible for service until Japan isdefeated :-Radio MechanicsWireless MechanicsM/T Drivers       ...............Vehicle MechanicsCooksRoyal Engineers for work as Royal MarineEngineers
addition 16,700 will be eligible for release in Class B on replacement by newentries. As the majority of the Class B releases are likely to be temporary officers or skilled or experienced ratings, it is important that most of this entry shouldtake place in the second half of 1945 to allow time for the men to be trained upto the standard required to replace those being released.11. To comply with the Re-allocation Plan, 16,000 replacements for Class b releases are, therefore, being asked for in addition to the new allocation of 40,000.12. No new allocations are proposed at this stage to replace normal wastageand battle casualties, to assist in the rapid redeployment of men in the Navy of low medical category who are unfit for service overseas and for whom there willbe insufficient Naval employment in this country. It is proposed to meet these requirements at the expense of releases in Class A as being more economical inman-power. For this reason no new allocations are being asked for to speed upreleases in Class A as suggested in the Re-allocation Plan. If some additionalrecruits from civilian sources are available they could be accepted and absorbed,but at this stage such action would entail the retention of more requisitionedpremises for training purposes and the employment of instructional staffs whoseequivalent in numbers might otherwise be released to civilian employment. It issuggested that this matter &apos;be re-examined in 6 months&apos; time, when such entriesmay be desirable to continue the flow of releases.An exception arises in the case of Engineer Officers. The question or releasesis here intimately connected with the question of fighting efficiency. We have atpresent a large number of Engineer Officers who are too old for&quot;service in the East.Our requirements of Engineer Officers for the Japanese war are little less than ourpresent resources, and the releases which will be possible will, therefore, be lessthan in any other branch of any service. Both from the view of fighting efficiency and to enable some releases to he given to Engineer Officers it will be essential toenter the largest possible number of engineers. The matter is being dealt with byLord Hankey&apos;s Committee.Woman-Power.13. It is proposed that an allocation of 3,000 be made for the W.R.N.S.It is realised that these will have to be volunteer entries. Such an allocation isnecessary in part to provide women of a suitable age for service overseas and alsoto assist in covering the abnormal wastage which is likely to be experiencedfollowing the release of so many men. Also it is desired to maintain a steadyflow of recruits, as if voluntary recruitment is stopped for any appreciable periodit is difficult to obtain entries when recruiting is reopened.No specific allocation is desired to provide for the replacement of W.R.N.S.personnel who may be released under Class B as the numbers are likely to be small, but it would be essential that authority should be given to recruit replace-ments for any Class B W.R.N.S. releases on a head-for-head basis.14.   The requirements for V.A.D.S and Nurses are 450 and 300 respectively.Summary of New Allocations required for the Royal Navy for the period June to 31st December, 1945.Men-(a) To make good deficiencies(b) Replacement of Class B releases(c) Replacement of wastageReplacement of battle casualtiesReplacement of men of low medicalcategory unfit service overseasTo facilitate redeploymentTo accelerate releases in Class ANewAllocations.40,000(Note (i) )16,000Nil.(Note iv)Transfersfrom R.A.F.17,200(Note (II) )Total, Men56,00017,200(Note (ii) )
