This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentPrinted for the War Cabinet, May, 1945SECRETCopy No.W.P. (45) 30317th May, 1945.WAR CABINETRELIEF SUPPLIES FOR PRISONERS OF WAR AND civilian internees IN THE FAR east memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. On the nth April, 1944, the War Cabinet approved a proposal to make two shipsavailable for the regular carriage of relief supplies to Allied prisoners of war and civilian internees in the Far East (W.M. (44) 47th Conclusions, Minute 3). One ship loaded with supplies and manned by a neutral crew was to proceed to a port designated by theJapanese on the perimeter of the areas within their control, and a second ship was to be handed over to the Japanese to be manned by a Japanese crew and to be used fordistributing the supplies from the designated port. Although this proposal was com-municated to the Japanese Government on the 8th May, 1944, repeated reminders have produced no response and the Swiss Government and the International Red cross committee have both advised us that there is no likelihood of the Japanese Governmenttaking any interest in our proposal.2. The need for opening a regular route for Red Cross supplies to prisoners in theFar East remains as pressing as ever. But there seems no hope of the JapaneseGovernment modifying their persistent refusal to permit any ship not manned by a japanese crew to approach any port in waters which they occupy or claim to occupyand the only hope left of persuading the Japanese Government to agree to any regularroute would appear to be to allow a ship manned by a Japanese crew to come to someport not under Japanese control.3. The possibilities of such a proposal have been carefully examined by the depart-ments concerned. The Foreign Office consider that the one port likely to be acceptable to the Japanese is Goa in Portuguese East India. This port has already been used bythe Japanese for exchanges of civilians, and any proposal at this stage that some otherport should be used would almost certainly rouse Japanese suspicions, lead to long delay and, quite possibly, receive no reply whatever. The Admiralty would, on security grounds, have preferred some port where movements could be more easily watched and controlled, but in the circumstances they are, I understand, prepared to agree to theuse of Goa by a Japanese manned ship.4. The Ministry of Economic Warfare call attention to the following considerations affecting the use of Goa:  (a) to allow a Japanese crew on a series of occasions to land at Goa and re-embarkwithout any supervision or examination of their persons or baggage, wouldprovide the Japanese with an opportunity not merely of casual smugglingbut of creating an organized system of transporting to Japan goods of smallvalue but of great strategic importance, of which Japan is in much need;(6) the Japanese could not be expected to agree to such arrangements (if indeedthese could be made at Goa) for supervision and search of the crew as wouldlessen the danger foreseen at (a), nor could it be expected that they would agree that the crew should not, in any circumstances, be allowed &quot;to land at Goa;(c) no effective control can be exercised over ingoing ships to Goa in the absenceof adequate contraband control bases in the Arabian Sea and the indian ocean: moreover, Goa has a land frontier with India of at least one hundredmiles, which only a large force could successfully control. The possibilitiesof corruption and the very mixed crews who visit Goa would make anyintervention of the Portuguese Authorities (if their co-operation were to beinvited) altogether useless.
5- The Government of India, on grounds of security, share the views expressed inparagraph 4, but though they feel strong objections to the use of Goa, they are preparedto waive them in the final issue, if all other possibilities fail.6. Whilst I recognize the force of the considerations set out in paragraph 4, I donot need to emphasize how essential it is, both from the point of view of the health and morale of our prisoners and civilians in the Far East, but also from the point of viewof public opinion at home, that we should not leave untried any possible way ofestablishing a regular flow of supplies.7. I therefore ask the War Cabinet to approve a proposal to the Japanese:  (a) that we should provide a cargo ship to be used exclusively for the transport ofRed Cross relief supplies for prisoners of war and civilian internees (fromthe British Commonwealth, the United States and Netherlands territories)and, on return journeys, for Japanese prisoners and internees;(&amp;) that we should grant safe-conduct on her journeys to this ship manned by a japanese crew and would agree to her picking up the supplies at Goa.This proposal has already been approved in principle by the representatives of ailthe Dominion Governments and the Government of India in Sub-Committee B of theImperial Prisoners of War Committee. If it is approved by the War Cabinet, I proposeit should be communicated to the United States Government before it is sent to the swiss Government for transmission to the Japanese Government, and that we should allow a reasonable interval (say a week or ten clays) for the United States Governmentto offer any comment they desire, but we should not, I suggest, seek their formalconcurrence in the proposal. It would also be communicated to the netherlands government.8. One of the problems inherent in the proposal would be to get the Japanese crewto the ship. The Japanese themselves may have some suggestion to offer on that point(they might even send a Japanese ship out, once, with a crew).The possibility of collecting a Japanese crew from amongst Japanese citizens heldwithin the British Empire is also being explored. So far this has not been successful,but I have not abandoned hope that we may be able to find such a crew, in which case would propose that, subject to the concurrence of the securhy authorities concerned,it should be offered to the Japanese Government with the ship.P.
