THIS DOCUMENT IS THE, PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MftJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has bee^ strictly limited. It as issued for the personal use of ..........SECRET. / CoPy No-OVERSEAS FINANCIAL POLICY IN STAGE III.1. It has been a prime object of policy on the part of the Treasury and ofthe Bank of England, for at least the last two or three years, so to conduct their technical tasks that we should end the war in a financial position which did not leave us hopelessly at the mercy of the United States. This does not mean that we seek or prefer an international system after the war in which we depend on ourown self-sufficiency, asisted by a chain of bilateral bargains with those countrieswhich cannot afford to lose our markets, and by the maintenance of the presentSterling Area arrangements in their war-time severity for an indefinite period.2. We cannot reasonably prefer such a system. A policy of economicisolationism and of economic rupture with the United States and Canada (andwith a large part of the rest of the world also) could only be practicable if we hadregained the financial reserves we have lost, and if we were prepared to live forseveral years after the war with rigid domestic controls and strict rationing of consumption, and with an organisation of foreign trade after the Russian model.It is certainly not compatible with a restoration of free enterprise. For only thosecountries would gang up with us which were prepared to denounce their com-mercial treaties with the United States and to forgo all prospect of borrowingeasy money from that country.   And. who would they be ?3. The purpose of maintaining and preserving a measure of financial strength is not to enable us to fall back on so frantic and suicidal an alternative,but that in negotiation we should both feel and appear sufficiently independentonly to accept arrangements that we deem acceptable. For it is one thing to takethe initiative in rupturing economic relations and refusing an accommodation, and quite another to stand out for what is reasonable in itself and appropriate to thepart we have played. Indeed, the bare possibility of an independent policy to beadopted in the last resort, if undue and improper pressure were to be exerted onthe other side, may be, in the mixed politics and mixed motives of the UnitedStates, a useful and even a necessary inducement to them to reach a settlement with us which is, in a wide comprehension and in the long run, the justest andwisest in the interests of our two countries and of the world. Mr. WalterLippmann, whom I reckon a good judge in such matters, has always been insistentin private discussion that our American friends, who will have to advocate theright kind of settlement before their own people, will find their task much easierif they can point out that we do have an alternative, though an alternative vervinjurious to the principles of a free economy and very disagreeable to Americanideas about post-war economic arrangements. The worse will be the best friend ofthe good.II.4. The first thing is, therefore, to take stock of the situation as it standsto-day, and to examine how far we have been successful and how far unsuccessfulhi our aim. The successes, which have been considerable, can be summarisedthus  4.-(i) From the earliest days of the war we have tried to avoid incurringdebts in foreign currencies or in gold.   In this we have been successful beyond any expectation which would have been reasonable before the event.   There is[29587J B
the Jesse Jones loan in United States dollars which we can liquidate at any time by selling the marketable securities hypothecated against it. There is the no-interest loan in Canadian dollars, corresponding to Canadian securities we our-selves hold, which can almost certainly be covered and embraced by our general post-war financial settlement with Canada. There is the gold set aside against our debt to Portugal where at present there is a hitch in our negotiations but where the gold liability can probably be reduced and spread over a longish period.Apart from these we owe the outside world nothing but sterling; and it is prettywell understood by those concerned that they are in our hands and cannot success-fully claim to use this sterling except in accordance with principles to he agreed with us hereafter (their chief anxiety is to learn as soon as possible what these principles are going to be. their present mood and that is all to the good--beingone which will, we hope, prove to be over-pessimism). On such conditions, bycunning and kindness, we have persuaded the outside world to lend us upwards of the prodigious total of  3.000 millions. The very size of these sterling debtsis itself a protection. The old saying holds. Owe your banker  1,000 and youare at his mercy; owe him  1,000,000 and the position is reversed.5. (ii) We have striven, with the utmost concentration of purpose ever since1941, to raise our liquid gold (and dollar) reserves to a substantial figure, thoughat the expense of a corresponding increase in sterling liabilities.   This is partly on the ordinary banking principle of keeping more yellow balls in the air thanyou hold in your hand, which we learnt long ago to practise with unconsciousease.   But it&apos;is even better than that; for such assets are fully liquid, which, aswe have just seen, is not equally true of the liabilities.   In this aim we nowlook like being more successful than seemed at one time probable.   We startedthe war with reserves of  600,000,000. By April 1941 we^had spent the lot andour reserves were literally nil.   With the inauguration of lend-lease we beganslowly to recoup.  But until recently it was a dogma of the United States Treasurythat reserves of  250.000.000 would be as much as were good for us, and thatlend-lease aid should be reduced whenever we looked likely to reach that figure.In the Washington conversations last autumn we persuaded Mr. Morgenthau thata goal of  500,000.000 would not be unreasonable, although under the arrange-ments we then secured it seemed likely that our end-reserves would not muchexceed  400.000,000.   Subsequent events, particularly the prolongation of theGerman war brinodns; greater earnings from the expenditure of the american troops than we had previously estimated, suggest that at the end of 1945 our total net reserves may approach  500,000,000 after allowing for an additionalreceipt of gold expected from South Africa towards the end of the year.   If theJapanese war continues through 1948, the current position will deteriorate asa result of the falling off or cessation of American troop expenditure in thiscountry.   Nevertheless, if we take account of the gold to be received under theFrench Agreement and a possible release of some gold under resumed Portuguesenegotiations, it is not impossible that we may, after all. retain the desired goalof  500.000.000 as our end-reserves on the eve of cease-fire in Asia.   The chiefdanger to the fulfilment of this hope, apart from a considerable prolongation ofthe Japanese war beyond the date when we cease to gain significant earnings from the American troops in this country, is the risk of a curtailment of lend-lease aid in the last lap when the approaching end of the war and the relative-size of our reserves are both apparent to the American Administration.  If duringStage II we find ourselves quarrelling with the United States Treasury and state Department about the nature of exchange and commercial arrangements in Stage III, it will be the easiest thing in the world for them, by sharply cur-tailing their assistance, to cause our reserves to melt away, so as to make usmore tender to their touch (for our good, of course so they would see it aswell as for their&apos;s).   Nevertheless, assuming that we do manage to reach andretain the goal of free net reserves of  500,000,000, that would provide the means(putting our bed-rock reserves, not to be touched except for the gravest cause, at 250-300,000,000) for greatly sweetening and alleviating the practical adminis-tration of the Sterling Area arrangements in the early post-war phase, in theevent of our being forced to endeavour to maintain them in their war-timecharacter with considerable rigour.6.-(iii) A third direction in which we can claim some significant success isin the quite recent measures for the evolution of the Sterling Area system inrelation to Europe, as exemplified by the Swedish Agreement, the BelgianAgreement and the French Agreement (with Holland, Switzerland, Portugal,Turkey and Persia still to be brought into line and fair hopes of doing so onreasonably satisfactory terms).   The recent generous offer by the Dominion of
Canada (though half-baked and scarcely workable exactly in the form suggested)could perhaps be modified into a scheme by which Canada agreed to holdsterling, receiving in return the freedom of the Sterling Area and (in truth)half entering it. In combination with the Special Account system covering alarge part of South America, all this means that we have gone far (and may soonhave gone further) towards establishing a modus vivendi for carrying on tradewithout immediate financial embarrassment with almost the whole world outsidethe United States.7. (iv) Before leaving the Sterling Area and technical questions ofexchange, we should record amongst the successes our^ day-to-day handling of theother parties concerned. The Sterling Area and Exchange Control generallycould have been so managed that everyone affected would by now have formed a firm determination to throw off the whole business at the earliest possible moment.In fact, the Bank of England and those occupied with Exchange Control in theTreasury have so contrived by consideration and reasonableness and traditionalo-ood manners, with scissors (in this context) ready when the red tape began tohind, as to leave behind a sense of good temper and good feeling. Should financialhearts (if there are such things) be opened, I believe it would be found that thoseoverseas would rather bank in London with blocked accounts than in New Yorkwith free ones. I reckon this a significant success, because it means that it mightnot be beyond our power to continue for a time, if need be, not perhaps the fullvigour of the game, but a fairly effective version of the war-time Sterling Area.Political objections in India, by those who know nothing of how the system isCarried on and therefore insuperable by considerate day-to-day handling, wouldbe the chief obstacle.8. (v) Finally, I record in the catalogue of success, the Stabilisation policy for domestic prices and the management of the Wage level.   It can be argued thatthe former has, in fact, cost nothing, since it has been worked in practice bytaxing certain branches of consumption in order to subsidise others; even, indeed,that it has been run at a profit, since the additional taxation of consumers hasgreatly exceeded the subsidies, without having given the consumer the feeling that prices taken as a whole are unreasonably high.  As for wage-rates, they have,it is true, risen somewhat faster than the cost of living.   Nevertheless, it must be conceded that the Ministry of Labour have, in the circumstances, done very well.The Stabilisation Policy of the Treasury and the Utility Programme of theBoard of Trade (which also deserves a grateful tribute) gave them their solidfoothold and they have taken good advantage of it.   As a result, I do not think there is much wrong with our competitive position overseas based on an exchangeof $4 -  1; at any rate the evidence is that a lower rate of exchange wouldharm, rather than help, us.    It would have been a very serious thing if the somewhat artificial rate of exchange maintained during the war had landed us with an overvalued currency at the end of it.    In fact, we have retained thebenefit, or most of it, of the initial depreciation of 20 per cent, in 1939.   The  to-day is under-valued rather than over-valued in relation to most other currencies.   All Middle East and Eastern currencies are over-valued through the comparative failure (in varying measure) to control inflation.    The liberatedEuropean countries tend to begin with over-valued rates for reasons of prestige and internal social policy.   The hourly wage to-day in this country is (broadly)2s. per hour; in the United States it is 5s. per hour (reckoned at an exchangeof $4).   Even the celebrated inefficiency of British manufacturers can scarcely(one hopes) be capable of offsetting over wide ranges of industry the wThole of thisinitial cost-difference in their favour, though, admittedly, they have managed itin some important cases.    Perhaps the chief danger, at any rate in the mass-production industries, is a cut-throat conrpetition in export prices by the americans loading them with less than their fair share of overhead costs (a practice which the much-abused international cartel is designed to prevent).   Theavailable statistics suggest that, provided we have never made the product before,we have the rest of the world licked on cost.  For a Mosquito, a Lancaster, Padar,we should have the business at our feet in  conditions of  free  and faircompetition.   It is when it comes to making a shirt or a steel billet that we haveto admit ourselves beaten both by the dear labour of America and by the cheaplabour of Asia or Europe.  Shipbuilding seems to be the only traditional industrywhere we fully hold our own.   If by some sad geographical slip the AmericanAir Force (it is too late now to hope for much from the enemy) were to destroyevery factory on the North-East Coast and in Lancashire (at am hour when the directors were sitting there and no one else), we should nave nothing to fear.[29587] B 2
How else we are to regain the exuberant inexperience which is necessary, it seems,for success, I cannot surmise.9. These various favourable factors are, between them, perhaps justsufficient to make a policy of financial independence of the United States not quiteimplausible, if the financial burden of the overseas balance could be kept in theearly post-war years within reasonable quantitative limits. We must, therefore,now turn to the other side of the account, and examine the aspects where wehave to register failure, or, rather, where there is not as yet a sufficientexpectation of success. So far the argument has run that we have a financialmachine which is technically not too bad at any rate we could not have hoped inour actual situation to have&apos; done much better. But it cannot carry an unlimitedload. At present the prospective load appears to me to be far beyond our unaidedpowers, mainly for the four reasons set forth below. It is still necessary to repeat, almost &quot;without change, what was written in a memorandum prepared forthe Chancellor of the Exchequer nearly six months ago. For in the meanwhilenothing much certainly nothing sufficient has been clone to remedy the position.10. (i) Our financial embarrassments have been, and still are, and look likebeing even after the war, mainly the result of the cash expenditure of the service departments in Africa, the Middle East, India and the Southern Dominions.Expenditure of every description in North and South America is under adequateTreasury control at any rate we know in considerable detail what it is for.European expenditure falls into a special category and is dealt with separatelyunder (iii) below. Treasury control over expenditure on imports which fell intopartial abeyance for a time is now being recovered; here again we know insome detail how and why the money is spent. But there remains a vast cashexpenditure overseas local expenditure incurred on the spot in the areasspecified at the beginning of this paragraph which is poured out, not only with no effective Treasury control, but without the treasury knowing either beforehandor afterwards, what it has been spent upon. At least that seems to be the case ina matter of two or three hundreds of   millions. This generalisation must bopartly qualified in the case of India because of the proceedings of the recentCabinet Committee on India which threw some dim light on the matter andproduced a very broad analysis of the global figure of expenditure under a fewmain heads.11. One need not doubt that most of this expenditure had a purpose once and resulted from the deliberate decision of some responsible person. In this context, however, I am chiefly alarmed by the apparent prospect (if nothing isclone about it) of the appalling rate at which this expenditure will be running onthe day at which the final Cease-Fire in Asia brings with it the end of Americanlend-lease and Canadian Mutual Aid. a rate which it may be impracticable toreduce rapidly if we take account of the clearing up of arrears as well as of running expenditure.12. The total cash overseas expenditure of British Government Departments,exclusive of the Ministry of Food and the Raw Materials Division of the Ministryof Supply, and also exclusive of all expenditure in Canada, United States, SouthAmerica and Europe, is estimated by the Bank of England as follows :    millions.1942    ...    Hill HP    ......      ...      584-41943     ..................       689-31944     ..................      716-3Broadly speaking, practically no part of this expenditure is arising currently(or in 1944) out of the war with Germany; and it is likely to increase rather thandecrease in Stage II. When we had thrown the Germans out of Africa, andthe Middle East was no longer in danger, our expenditure in those parts remainedmuch as before.   The Major-Generals in Cairo look like becoming chronic.13. It will be observed that this expenditure is currently exceeding, andover the whole period has been about equal to, our total net disinvestment,throughout the world, which has been as follows :    millions.1941        ..................      6611943        ...      ...............      6811944..................      651Thus it is this expenditure which is wholly responsible for our financial difficulties.
14. Some further analysis is instructive. Included in the above in 1944there were Treasury advances to Allied Governments of about  60 millions.Ministry of Supply expenditure, presumably for munitions, came to another 60 millions, almost wholly in Australia and South Africa (the Ministry ofSupply&apos;s share of Indian expenditure is not separately analysed). Foreign Officeand N.A.A.F.I. and other miscellaneous items accounted for another  32 millions.This leaves us with the hard core of War Office, Air Ministry and Admiraltyexpenditure which deserves analysis country by country and year by year asfollows :  Expenditure of War Office, Air Ministry and Admiralty in certain areas.Ceylon   ...AustraliaSouth Africa   ...New ZealandEgypt and SudanPalestine and Transjordan   ...IraqBritish West Africa ...British East and Central AfricaMalta and CyprusMiscellaneous Sterling Area ...Turkey  ...PersiaIndia*1942.13820197281314161110111248222  millions.1943.17 111-824-01-992-033301517-613-215-74-413-7290-5281-21944-26123217628111220111718260313470-5571-7574-1* Refund to Indian Government of recoverable war expenditure.15. It will be noticed that over the three years the Indian expenditure towhich so much attention has been directed (though with so little result) has onlyamounted to half the total, and that as much again has been spent in the neighbouring areas.16. So far as I am aware, there is no detailed information in the Treasuryconcerning the nature of this expenditure. The bare totals have only beenobtained through the assiduity of the Statistical Branch of the Bank of Englandand were not available until recently. Further examination would presumablyshow that its purposes are divided between (a) the war against Japan;(b) the policing of the Middle East;(c) the maintenance of lines of communication.But whether the maximum of economy in regard to, e.g., (b) is being exercised,how far continuing expenditure is due to avoidable time-lags in revising decisions,how far general policies have been taken at home without sufficient (or any)knowledge of the cost involved, what pressure there is on local commanders toexercise maximum economy, whether we are not meeting expenditure which wouldbe more properly a charge on the local government, and so forth of all that i know nothing. In the context of this paper one particularly wishes to know what expenditure we shall still have to incur in these areas after Cease-Fire in asia. In this connection it is disturbing to be informed that the British personnel in the Middle East (altogether apart from India and Ceylon) a year after theend of the German war will be consiclerablv greater than it is now, and thatthis is not judged to be inconsistent with a recent directive from the PrimeMinister for an immediate reduction of the personnel in this area by 25 per cent.17. Obviously this is a large subject and one may go widely astray throughignorance. But the prima facie evidence of the global statistics is that unless itis advisable and. practicable to bring this expenditure under drastic control atan early date (and perhaps it is not), our ability to pursue an independentfinancial policy in the early post-war years will be fatally impaired.18. (ii) The second cause for anxiety is the state of preparation for thepre-organisation of our exports.
19. This is too Large a subject to embark upon here. But it is necessaryto emphasise that the financial machinery described in the earlier part of thissection cannot work without fuel. In post-war conditions the existing sterling area arrangements can only function if we on our side can supply desired goodsin satisfactory volume. Our main difficulty in financial negotiation already isthe inability to promise in return any reasonable volume of goods. Meanwhile,it is fanciful and misleading to talk about an increase of 50 per cent, or more in the volume of our exports, unless it is made clear that this does not apply tothe immediate post-war phase. A recent calculation indicates that, withoutdrastic changes of method not at present in view, a more realistic expectation isan increase of 22 per cent, even in the post-transition period, with a much lower figure during the transition. This disturbing result, which would mean chronicinsolvency, is due to the large part played by coal and cotton textiles in ourpre-war exports and the likelihood of a decline, rather than an increase, afterthe war if these industries continue to be run as at present. Clearly the first step is to work out a better target than this, and the second is to hit it. In thepresent context it is the volume of exports which we can develop in the first threeyears after the Avar which is chiefly relevant. Yet the Bank of England statis-ticians no longer expect any improvement in the volume of our exports in 1945compared with 1944. Indeed, their figure for the &quot;second quarter of this year,on which we are now embarking, is 7 per cent, below the figure for thecorresponding quarter of last year.20. (iii) The burden on us of relief and reconstruction outside these islands,(a) through U.N.R.R.A., (b) during the military period and in areas not atpresent within the scope of U.N.R.R.A., (c) arising out of the occupation ofGermany, (d) for our own liberated territories in the Far East, is at presentindeterminate and menacing. We have already undertaken a liability of 105 millions for (a) and (b). Proposals have been prepared in the treasury in respect of (a), (b) and (c) which might serve at any rate to keep our liability inexcess of  105 millions within determinate bounds, provided we succeed ininsisting on their adoption without compromise. But shall we ? The ColonialOffice estimate the cost of (d) at  150 to  200 millions. I would urge most strongly that this should be regarded as a liability to be carried by the Common-wealth as a whole and not by us alone. We all know about India. South Africahas profiteered out of the war remorselessly, for all General Smuts&apos;s fine words(perhaps because of them). Australia is beginning to tread the same path (sheis finding herself rich enough to pay off a considerable volume of pre-war debt inthis country).21. (iv) Apart from their sharing in the cost of relief and reconstruction in the Far Eastern members of the Commonwealth, the basis of the financialsharing of Defence by the sterling Dominions, both now and after the war, needs to be put on a new basis, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer has emphasised tous. The extent to which currently they are slipping out of financial responsibility,and the scale on which they are building up war profits at our expense, may notbe generally appreciated (since it is a comparatively recent development), anddeserves to be set out nakedly.(a) Australia.In 1944 Australia made a net overseas profit out of the war of  94 millions.This was after spending  45 millions on overseas war expenditure, which,however, included some arrears. In 1945 they are expected to make a profit of 58 millions. The decrease is more than explained by diminished receipts from united States forces; they will be making more out of us than before. For their total overseas war expenditure in 1945 is expected to shrink to  28 millions. We,on the other hand, will be expected to pay them cash for our war expenditure inAustralia to the amount of  69 millions. If we had the same reciprocal aidarrangements with Australia that the United States has or that we ourselves have with France, we should be b tter off by  41 millions in the year, and australia would still be making a handsome surplus, such as she would have been wellsatisfied with in earlier years.(b) New Zealand.This small country made a net overseas profit of  23 millions in 1944 andis expected to gain another  18 millions in 1945. Of this total of  41 millionsabout half, namely  20 millions, is due to our having agreed to make a supple-mentary payment to her of this amount on account of the difference between world
prices and her local prices in respect of her supplies of food to us. At the sametime her overseas war expenditure, which was  18,500,000 in 1944, will shrinkin 1945 to  6.500,000.(c) South Africa.Including accretions to her gold reserve and repatriations of securities,South Africa gained  38 millions in 19i4 and is expected to gain  49 millions in1945. Against this her overseas war expenditure in 1945, excluding some arrearsstill due, will have fallen to the derisory figure of  11 millions.22. In short, whilst Canada is doing her full duty, the Southern Dominionsare scarcely doing a thing.   Observe this table : 1945 (estimates)Overseas profit C + )   After meeting overseasor loss ( ) war expenditure of  millions.United Kingdom.........       -750 896Australia............       -1- 58 28New Zealand      .........       t 18 6^South Africa*     ......... ... 11* Excluding 10 arrears from both columns.Out of our overseas war expenditure of 896, we shall be spending 69 in Australia,and 20 in South Africa. This is exclusive of what we spend in these countries on food and war materials.23. I register, therefore, our financial arrangements with the sterlingDominions (let alone India) amongst our significant failures and a part cause ofour financial weakness. The Chancellor rightly concludes that this smallcountry is carrying a burden of Imperial Defence which she cannot continue tocarry by herself.  There is a time-lag in our perspective in this field as elsewhere.III.24. What is the upshot? If matters go on substantially as at present, weshall be running an overseas deficit on the day of Cease-Fire in Asia at the rateof about  1,400 millions per annum, assuming that Lend-Lease and Mutual aid for food and raw materials are then terminated, but that we have no furtherliability for any dollar expenditure in respect of munitions and war-stores,whether to be delivered or to be cancelled or as salvage in the Sterling Area.With our best efforts, current expenditure (which will have to include the clearing up of arrears) will only decline gradually. Assuming some improvementmeanwhile in the unsatisfactory features just dealt with, an intensive economydrive to reduce overseas war expenditure, and a not less intensive export drive,we might get through the first year of Stage III with an adverse balance notexceeding  1,000 millions. But we cannot prudently assume much less. Nor is this the end. Three to five years are likely to elapse before we reach equilibrium.There is no present warrant for putting the cumulative deficit before we reachequilibrium at less than  2,000 millions. The bulk of this, and perhaps morethan this, will have to be borrowed from outside the Sterling Area. For, whilstsome Sterling Area countries may run a surplus with the rest of the world,several of them, full of money and empty of goods and in certain cases devastatedby the enemy, will certainly run a deficit. If the rest of the Sterling Area, taken as a whole, breaks even, we shall have done fairly well.25. Let us hope that this will have proved to err on the pessimistic side. Itmay. Such estimates generally do; although other good judges fear that theabove may err on the optimistic side. However that may be, if our mostextravagant hopes were to come true, a deficit over the period as a whole inexcess of  1,000 millions seems a certainty. Thus this is not a well-chosen moment for a declaration of our financial independence of North America. Ournecessities in the transition after the war will put a quantitative burden on thefinancial machine described earlier in this paper far greater than it can carrywithout further financial aid from the United States and Canada. At the verybest, even assuming a fabulous improvement in. the above weak spots, we should do well to assume that complete financial independence of the United states would require : -(a) the continuance of war rationing and war controls more stringent thanat present for (say) three to five years after the war;
(b) the national planning and direction of foreign trade both imports and exports, somewhat on the Russian model; and(c) an   indefinite   postponement   of   Colonial   Development   and   far eastern rehabilitation and a virtual abandonment of all overseasactivities, whether military or diplomatic or by way of developingour trade, wealth and influence, which involved any considerable expenditure.26. There remains a further, and in my judgment an overriding, considera-tion which, so far, has only been touched upon in passing. A policy of economicisolationism means acceptance indeed, not merely the acceptance but theadvocacy of a system of international economy after the war of a kind towhich all sections of opinion, not only in the United States but also inCanada, are bitterly opposed. It is foolish to suppose if we take this line that the North/Americans will remain passive. They will regard us as having deliberately rejected a helping hand for reasons of envy and ambition,and as recklessly disrupting the common Anglo-American front whichis the best hope of the world. We must also expect strong opposition on the partof many of the Sterling Area countries to gang up with us like this againstUnited States and we might end up with a greatly curtailed sterling area.Outside the Sterling Area the United States would use its lending power to persuade many countries, especially in Western Europe and South America, torefuse to fall in with our ideas. In short, the moment at which we have for thetime being lost our financial strength and owe vast sums all round the world isscarcely the bright and brilliant occasion for asking all our creditors to join up with us against where financial power now rests, not for the purpose of gettingpaid, but for the purpose of obliging us with a little more.27. All this is. of course, on the assumption that the Americans are in factprepared to make us a fair offer, not so much generous as just, using their financial strength not as an instrument to force us to their will, but as a means of making it possible for us to participate in arrangements which we ourselves prefer ontheir merits if only they can be made practicable for us. It would be a gravemisdeed to prepare for isolationism if any reasonable terms are open to us onwhich we can walk with the Americans and the Canadians along the path whichsurely, if we can keep to it, offers much the best hope both for ourselves and for others. If, on the other hand, no such terms are obtainable, if the hostile forcesin the United States overwhelm the forces of light and friendship (which ispossible but not probable), then the whole situation is changed. By reason ofthis possibility, but also (much more to the point) as a matter of tactics it isnecessary to keep alive the disagreeable, indeed the disastrous, alternative,without, however, disguising from ourselves its true character. Perhaps I run the risk of enlarging on the obvious. But a position of complete independence within our own family is so naturally attractive to those who are not in a positionto see so clearly the other side of the medal that it might be a mistake to scampthe argument.28. It is not merely in order to oblige the Americans (and the Canadians)and as the price of their assistance that it is in our interest to embrace the inter-national, as opposed to the isolationist or etatist, scheme of foreign trade.The international system is, on its merits, in our interests. For two reasons. Thenature of our trade does not lend itself to bilateral arrangements; what suitsour exporters is to have the whole world as their playground without referenceto the question what and where it suits quite another set of persons, namely, ourimporters, to buy. Moreover, the terms of trade under forced barter conditionsare bound to be to our disadvantage. We could, I suppose, maintain a certainlevel of subsistence on a barter basis, but we could not expect to get fat. nor should this system be advocated by those who in other contexts extol theadvantages of free enterprise. For barter trade is the very antithesis to individual enterprise. Every bargain would have to be undertaken by a Govern -ment Department, and exporters, unless they were subjected (as they would haveto be) to compulsion, would soon find that &quot;the game was not worth the candle.Indeed, planned bilateral trade, with a view to making sure that exports balanceimports, is a feeble version of the Russian method of a State monopoly of exports and imports, and likely to be much less efficient. Indeed, if the free enterprisealternative breaks down (as it may), it is probably to the Russian model, in myopinion, that we shall have to look; and we may even have to make some experi-ments in this direction in the near future.   Indeed, planned bilateralism is being
chiefly advocated in this country to-day (with a few notable exceptions) by thenea r-Communists.29. The second reason is our position as the financial centre of the greaterpart of the British Commonwealth and also of a number of countries outside it.We built up the pre-war Sterling Area because we were bankers amiable to treatwith and having a long record of honouring our cheques. It is a great mistake to believe that we can regain or retain this position except on the basis thatsterling is a freely convertible currency. Bilateral proposals are sometimesadvocated on the ground that they are the best means to preserve the Sterling Area.Nothing could be further from the truth. They are a sure means of disruptingit. There would be very little left, if anything, of the Sterling Area on the basisof making sterling a permanently inconvertible currency which could only beused to purchase goods over a limited field. Each member in turn would walk outon us. The proposals of this paper are, and are intended to be, the means to recover for London its ancient prestige and its hegemony.30. The foregoing observations do not imply a lack of sympathy with the anxiety about our future balance of payments which underlies the bilateralapproach in the minds of those of its advocates who are far from desiring on its merits a State monopoly of foreign trade. They ask themselves what hope is there of reaching equilibrium on any other basis. Is not the use of our positionas a great consumer, to force our goods out on to the world in return for whatthe world wishes to sell to us, the only new weapon in our armoury and one wecannot do without ? I do not claim that there is a conclusive answer to this. Iam far from certain that we shall reach trade equilibrium in the post-war worldby the methods of free, enterprise. It is very possible, indeed, that the system will break down and that nothing short of a State monopoly of foreign trade (forthat is what planned bilateralism comes to in practice) will serve our needs.31. No. The future is to be viewed with anxiety. The present argumentdoes not flow from a blind faith in the blessings of free enterprise. Thea. igument stands firm on four fixed points of conviction : First, in the actualposition of this small island as the. centre of an independent world system (sodifferent in every respect from the position of Russia or of the United States) thefreedom of trade is. on its merits, to our great advantage if it can be made towork. Second, at this stage of the evolution of thought and politics it is the onlypath along which we can walk as partners in a better hope with the United Statesand Canada. Third, the future is altogether unclear and unpredictable therecan be no sufficient evidence at this date of time for choosing the worse beforetrying the better. Fourth, if international trade on these principles breaks down(as well it may), we shall be in a vastly better position to justify a change and toask others to join with us on new lines than if we were to go our own way nowalone, and very much alone, without giving a trial to the alternative. Even if Iwere convinced, that those will certainly prove right who believe that we can onlylive in the post-war world by a State planning of foreign trade, I should never-tiieless think it wise statesmanship to act to-day on the other hypothesis.32. I do not seek to conclude that the policy of isolation is, even in the last resort, utterly impracticable. On the contrary, as I have mentioned, we want to be able to pretend with sufficient plausibility that it offers a just possible alternative.- But it might be expected to lead to serious political and socialdisruption at home and our withdrawal, for the time being, from the positionof a first-class Power in the outside world. We should have to retire,as Russia did between the wars, to starve and reconstruct. We might, likeRussia, emerge in good health half a generation later, but nothing much less thanKussian methods would have served our turn meanwhile. Indeed, the danger is that our dismay at the character of this alternative will make us weaknegotiators and too willing to accept under pressure the other extreme, which iscertainly the line of least resistance. For we shall need a robust spirit in negotia-tion and a willingness to face a breakdown, if necessary, in the first round. Ifthe alternative just described is Starvation Corner, the other extreme, to whichI now turn, should be called Temptation.IV.33,   What, then, is the amount of American aid which we are likely to need ?It is impossible to quantify this with any degree of accuracy on the basis of what[29587] c
is now known. I put it at a probable minimum of $5 billions ( 1,250 millions) withup to (say) $8 billions possibly required to give us real liberty of action and toallow us to offer from the start the full multilateralism of trade and exchange whichwill be the best inducement to the Americans to fall in with our proposals. Alarger sum might demoralise us and prevent us from ever reaching equilibriumagain except after further crisis and some humiliation. We should certainly aim at getting through with $5 billions, but a call on a further $3 billions is veryadvisable if we are to have the full confidence and resources to develop our trade on far-sighted lines and to play our proper part in the world after the war.34. Let us now turn to a closer inspection of Temptation. There is not muchdoubt that the Americans would be ready, and even eager, to lend us large sumson their own terms $5 billions without doubt and perhaps the full $8 billionsspread over a period. Nor wall the terms they propose be, from their own point ofview (whatever we may think), particularly unreasonable. I guess that the con-ditions which it would be easy to negotiate might be somewhat as follows :  (a) A low rate of interest, certainly not higher than 2-1 per cent., and perhapsas low as 2 per cent.(&amp;) Easy terms of repayment of capital, spread over (say) thirty years andnot beginning for ten years, with provisions for postponement if, whenthe time comes, the burden appears too great for us.(c) Free multilateral clearing within the Sterling Area from the beginning,i.e., the unfettered conversion into dollars of the current earnings ofthe Sterling Area countries even during the provisional period.(d) Perhaps the same condition in respect of the pre-zero hour sterling-balances.(e) A pretty full implementation of the ideals of Article VII as understood by the Americans, with substantial concessions on our part totheir point of view in the matters of preferences, cartels, bulkpurchasing, &amp;c.(/) The wiping out of any remaining Lend-Lease liability, but the inclusion in the above loan of various obligations arising out of the winding-upof Lend-Lease.35. A good many of those whom we reckon the more friendly will start outalong some such lines as the above, and will consider in their own minds that theyare offering us a square, and even a generous, deal. I am afraid that, if we could do no better, most of us would, when we were right up against it, prefer thisTemptation to Starvation Corner, which is not far from politically impossible,both at home and abroad, if Temptation is offering round the corner.36. What, then, without overstating them, are the objections to this version of Temptation ? 1(i) Some part, perhaps a considerable part, of what we should otherwiseowe to the Sterling Area and other countries, winch are our naturalcustomers, we should come to owe to the United States instead. Per-haps $2 billions might get thus transferred, as compared with theresult of deferring free convertibility until the end of the provisionalperiod.(ii) We should owe the United States an annual sum of, say, $200 millions in interest (assuming 2^ per cent, on $8 billions), and, after an interval,say, a further $300 millions for capital repayment, that is an annualservice of $500 millions a year, tapering away in the course of time.This would be in addition to a large outstanding debt of some$12 billions to other countries. It would be rash to say that this isimpossible. Time and progress diminish the significance of whatbegin by seeming large figures. Moreover, we might find $5 billionssufficient. But we cannot be sure of shouldering such a burden with success, and we might find ourselves in a chronic condition of having to make humiliating and embarrassing pleas for mercy and postpone-ment. It is interesting to note that the total war burden we should hecarrying under the above assumptions adds up to exactly the samefigure, namely, $20 billions, that the Russians think appropriate inthe case of Germany (though they will not get it or anything like).(iii) It would be wrong to expect us to make concessions &quot;in the field ofeconomic policy under financial pressure.
37. But the main objection surely lies, not in these details, but in the wholeproposed set-up being an outrageous crown and conclusion of all that has happened. The war would end by placing on Germany an external burden of120 billions or less; it would end by placing on us a burden of $20 billions ormore. It would end in Germany being forced into conformity with an economic policy designed from without; and the same here. She would plead to Russiafrom time to time for mercy and deferment; and so should we to the UnitedStates. It is not as the result of some statistical calculation about what we mightbe able to manage, that the mind revolts from accepting the counsels of Tempta-tlon. The fundamental reasons for rejection are incommensurable in terms of cash.38. Nevertheless, before turning to the third line of approach, which I shallventure to call Justice, it is necessary to examine the possible mitigations of apolicy on the above broad lines which one might be able to secure in negotiation.It may be that a point comes when Temptation is sufficiently transformed to approach Justice. We must be clear in our heads about the best version of what we can perhaps fall back upon.39. I have made bold to say that the above terms would be easy to negotiate.I think there are improvements on these terms which it might not be impossibleto obtain, compatibly with accepting this general line of approach. For example,the annual service of the loan might be greatly lightened either by reducing theinterest to a token figure or by deferring the final date of discharge or by bothexpedients. An annual service of 1 per cent, would cost only $80 millions a yeareven on a loan of $8 billions. It might be allowed that we need not releaseany part of the pre-zero hour sterling balances, but only their current earnings. Itmight be tacitly agreed that no element of financial pressure should enter intothe conversations on commercial policy and other extraneous subjects.40. Such a settlement would not be unduly onerous, financially or econo-mically, on ourselves in relation to the United States, though it would leave us with the problem of the old sterling balances unmitigated. But it still fails to measure up to the criterion of Justice. The financial benefit to the UnitedStates would be next door to nothing, and worth less than nothing to theAmerican economy. The sweet breath of Justice between partners, in what hadbeen a great and magnanimous enterprise carried to overwhelming success, wouldhave been sacrificed to some false analogy of &quot;business.&quot; And even thenUncle Sam might quite likely remain under the conviction that he was Uncle Sap,a conviction which can only be removed by making him enter into the meeting-place by a different door.V.41. What is this different door? It is not through the approach of reliefsuch as is appropriate to Greece or Jugoslavia or aid in the finance of rehabilitation-iion such as France or Czechoslovakia can properly ask; but through the approach of a general re-consideration of the proper burden of the costs of the war.42. For a hundred good reasons we have had to accept during the war a post-war financial burden entirely disproportionate to what is fair. The themeis familiar. We did it in the interests of getting on with the war withoutwaste of time or loss of war-like efficiency. As a result, we, and we only, endup owing vast sums, not to neutrals and bystanders, but to our own Allies,Dominions and Associates, who ought to figure in the eyes of history as ourmercenaries, unless the balance is redressed. This does not apply particularly to the United States; indeed, to them (and to Canada) proportionately least ofall. It applies all round. Nevertheless, it is only through appropriate action bythe United States and Canada that there is a prospect of an agreed generalre-settlement. To which it should be added that the reward to the NorthAmericans will not merely be that their action is contributory to the establish-ment of Justice, but also that, at very small cost to their economies, perhaps at less than no true cost at all, we shall be made able to be their partners andcoadjutors in setting up a post-war international economy of the character onwhich they have set their hearts.[29587] n
43. The President has often used words implying that he accepted in somesense the principle of equal sacrifice. We must ask him to let us take him athis word at least to some extent. This does not mean that there is a clearlogical conclusion to which we can press matters. Sacrifices are incommensurable.Apart from which we must be practical and work with a broad brush. There isa big gap between equality of sacrifice and our being left with a heavier overseasfinancial burden than Germany, a burden which we shall owe to our A Hies. let us, therefore, consider a version of what we might accept as doing at the sametime substantial justice and as allowing us to fall in whole-heartedly and sincerelywith the American ideal of the post-war international economy.44. The United States would be asked to play a part in this, but, as itwill be seen, by no means an exclusive part. The method of redistribution of theburden and the rubric under which it is effected, which seem to me to be thebest, after considering alternatives, both technically and politically and psycho-logically, is the following : (i) During the period before lend-lease came into full operation we spentsome 13 billions on purchases in the United States for what afterwardsbecame a common war. Moreover, it was this expenditure which built up the munitions industries in the United States before they entered the war to their immense advantage after they entered it. This sumthe United States would agree to refund to us as a sort ofretrospective lend-lease.(ii) This payment, supplemented by the credit arrangements proposed below,would make it possible for us to undertake that we would acceptcle facto convertibility of sterling within a year after the end of thewar (without necessarily waiving the other relaxations contemplatedduring the transitional period).(iii) With this support behind us we would approach the various membersof the Sterling Area with proposals for dealing with their sterling balances. These would not necessarily follow a uniform pattern, but might be, in general, except where there is good reason to the contrary,on the following lines :  (a) Each member of the Area would contribute a proportion of thefinal total of its sterling balances to the costs of the commonvictory.(b) A proportion would be left liquid and would become fullyconvertible over the exchanges for the purpose of meetingcurrent transactions in any part of the world.(c) The remainder would be funded on terms to be explained below.(d) Alternatively, if any member of the Area would not accept such proposals, no part of their sterling balances would be madeavailable except on the terms explained below.(e) The figure of the sterling balances to be handled in one or other of these ways would include an appropriate allowance for thecost of our post-war demobilisation and terminal liabilities aswell as the accumulations during the war.(iv) In addition to the relief under (i) above, the United States to give us a call on dollars exercisable over (say) ten years up to a further$5 billions if required at a token rate of interest and on easy terms of repayment.45. Let us now consider this in more detail. In the first place, it willprobably be advisable to limit the above cancellation and funding proposals tothe members of the Sterling Area and to leave outside this settlement the non-Sterling Area indebtedness to be dealt with otherwise. When one looks into thedetails this seems to be the only practicable arrangement. Moreover, we can probably manage to deal with the non-Sterling Area balances one way or another.In particular, we can, if necessary, fund certain of them on as large a scale as wechoose, since we are not under the same moral or legal obligation as we are in thecase of the Sterling Area balances, to make at least some part of them convertibleinto dollars. In fact, if the rest has been dealt with satisfactorily, we can probably manage (as it will be seen below) to make most of these miscellaneousbalances fully convertible from the start.
46. At the end of 1944 net Sterling Area liabilities stood at  2,390 millions,and liabilities to the rest of the world (including &quot; Resident &quot;- Allied Govern-rnents, Enemy Custodians, &amp;c.) at  781 millions, making a total of  3,171 millions.By the end of the war (should it come early in 1946) we might, without much error, assume Sterling Area balances as being  3,000 millions and the rest 1,000 millions.47. The non-Sterling Area aggregate includes a number of items which need not, and could not appropriately, be included in the suggested settlement as follows :   millions.(i) United States (Jesse Jones loan, &amp;c., covered by collateral outof which it will be discharged, and registered sterlingwhich is already deducted in arriving at our net reserves) 78(ii) Canada (Non-interest loan and sundry balances which willprobably be brought into hotch-potch in any post-warfinancial arrangements with Canada)     ...       ...       ...       139(iii) Portugal (covered by gold and allowed for in reckoning ournet reserves, which must in any case be the subject ofspecial negotiation, leading, we hope, to a release of someof the gold)    ...&quot;     ..................        72(iv) Held by custodians and Trading with the Enemy Depart-ment (which are safely in our hands and must be thesubject of special arrangements; the largest item, France,has just been dealt with)   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...        70(v) European Allies and their possessions and China. (Theywill need all this to make purchases from the sterling area. Our task is to get as much of their future purchasesas possible paid for in gold by those who have gold. Herealso special arrangements are both possible and inevitable.The major items are Norway 73, Holland and posses-sions 64, Belgium and possessions 13, France andpossessions 21, Greece 52, China 21)        ...       ...       ...      253612Deducting these items from the total of  781 millions, wre have only  169 millionsleft. The greater part of this is Argentine (72) and Brazil (35), leaving no more than  62 millions for the whole of the rest of the world, which can be reckoned as normal balances and present no problem. Argentine and Brazil,moreover, can be cleared by disposing of our investments in those countrieswhich we should effect by a very tough bargain, when our hands are freer thanthey are now, securing the full value of our original investment.48. These details confirm our previous conclusion that we can confineour attention in the present context to the Sterling Area balances. At theend of 1944 these were made up as follows :   millions.australia new zealand south AfricaIndiaEgypt and SudanPalestine and TransjordanBurma, Malaya and Hong KongOther Crown ColoniesEireIraqIceland122*46281,00435610713141010369142,390* Against this we hold stocks of Australian wool, our payments for which are included inthe above.[29587]d 2
We must expect this total to have reached  3,000 millions by the end of thewar and perhaps not much short of  3,500 millions if we make a properallowance for expenses attributable to the war incurred during the phase ofdemobilisation. There are, however, here also a number of cases which neednot be brought into the general settlement. Burma, Malaya and Hong Kong arespecial cases, which might be allowed their share of liquidity without cancellation of any part of their balances. South Africa, having gold, needs no free dollars,and the settlement here should consist in her making a substantial contribution in gold as will be suggested below. Thus we are left with a probable post-bellumaggregate approaching  3,000 millions (as at the end of demobilisation) whichis prima facie suitable for the proposed general settlement, made up (roughly)as follows :   millions.IndiaEgyptPalestineIraqAustraliaEireCrown Colonies (apart from Malaya and Hong Kong)1,500500130801501205203,00049. The proposal is, then, that the above liabilities should be divided into three portions, one part to be made fully convertible, one part to be funded andone part to be written off. In determining the respective sizes of the threeportions each country could be dealt with on its merits. For their individualcircumstances and the causes behind the increases vary widely. The following-circumstances, amongst others, would be relevant to the final determination : (a) In general an amount not less than the opening balances, as at the30th June, 1939, might be left convertible;(b) The local price-level at which the indebtedness was incurred, relativelyto United Kingdom prices, should be taken into account;(c) In general an amount equal to the favourable commercial balance earnedduring the war, apart from United Kingdom war expenditure, afterdeduction of what has been already paid for in gold or by repatriation of securities, might be left convertible in addition to the opening-balances under (a) above.(d) The scale of Lend-Lease assistance received, or reciprocal aid accordedand earnings from United States forces should be considered.(e) The scale of war expenditure for which they have already made them-selves responsible.50. It will be found that in the cases of India, Egypt, Palestine and Iraqtheir receipts from our war expenditure exceed the increment of their sterling balances; that is to say, more than the whole of their commercial earnings hasbeen paid for in gold or in repatriated securities. In these countries, moreover,we should be entitled to write down their balances by at least a third on accountof the inflated local prices at which they have been acquired. (They couldrecover the whole of this writing off in terms of their local currency bydepreciating their exchanges to the same extent, which perhaps they ought to be encouraged to do in the interests of the future equilibrium of their balance ofpayments.) Alone of the above countries India has borne a heavy share of war expenditure. The Crown Colonies may be felt to present some difficulty. but most of them have escaped any serious war expenditure so far, and they have earned substantial sums from our local war expenditure of exactly the samecharacter as have India and Egypt. There is, for example, no reason in principle to discriminate in favour of Palestine compared with Iraq or Egypt; or in favourof Ceylon and the East and West African colonies compared with India,except that the appropriate scale in these latter cases would be, of course,much lower. Exact statistics are not available, but enough is known toenable broad justice to be done. The most difficult case is that of Eire, the wholeof the increment in her sterling balances being due to her commercial earnings and a steady receipt of  11,000,000 a year from Irish labourers in this country.Perhaps the right solution there will be to cancel nothing, but to fund a high proportion.
51. A first, quick glance at the relevant evidence suggests that the resultsmight come out somewhat as follows : Freed. Funded.        Cancelled.  millions.India     .........      250 750 500Egypt     ......      ...        80 250 170Palestine           ......        25 70 35Iraq        .........        15 25 40Australia          ......        50 - 50 50Eire        .........        30 90Malaya and Hongkong        100 30Other Crown Colonies           200 235 85750 1,500 88052. It should be explained that the freed balances would be made convertiblefor the purpose of meeting a current deficit of trade. They could not, forexample, be taken away in gold to set up a reserve at home or elsewhere abroad.The funded portion might be on the basis of 1 per cent, interest which would bepaid as liquid, convertible cash, and 2 per cent, per annum of the capital released for special purchases of British goods, beginning 5 years after the war. On 1,500 millions this would cost us  15 millions a year at the start and another 30 millions released per annum after 5 years, not all of which would be anadditional burden on the balance of payments.53. The writing off could be conveniently operated in most cases throughthe Currency Note Reserves by substituting domestic Treasury Bills for british treasury Bills in the Currency Reserves, thus in effect creating a fiduciary issue to the corresponding amount or with other Government or Central Bank Fundsor by the cancellation of loans advanced to His Majesty&apos;s Government duringthe war. In the cases of Palestine, Iraq and Eire some part of the privately heldbalances would have to be funded, which would probably mean in practice theirhaving to be acquired by the Central Bank.54. The countries in question would have the option to come into this settlement. If they declined the option, then we should fund the ivhole of the balances, let us say at per cent, interest in liquid, convertible cash, and theprincipal sum to be made available at the rate of 1 per cent, per annum after fiveyears and only for special purchases of British goods. No one would decline the option if they were convinced that this was the alternative.55. So far we have asked for a retrospective contribution to the costs ofthe war of  750 millions ($3 billions) from the United States and of about 880 millions from the Sterling Area. But there remain certain furthermatters : *(a) It was suggested above that we should also be given a call to borrow fromthe United States exercisable at any time during the first ten yearsafter the war. The limit of this might be $5 billions at 1 per cent,interest and a sinking fund of 1 per cent, per annum of the initialamount, beginning ten years after the war, rising to 2 per cent, perannum after a further ten years.(b) How does Canada come into the picture 1   She, like the United States.would gain from the date of the settlement the full freedom ofexchange within the Sterling Area which she so ardently desires. Thefinal settlement with her might be as follows :  (i) The no-interest loan, originally $700 millions but reduced by now to a lower figure, should be confirmed in its present status,i.e., no interest and the proceeds of certain British-ownedCanadian securities to be devoted to repayment, which mightclear off the loan within ten or fifteen years.(ii) The unsettled war outstandings amounting altogether to aboutCanadian $600 millions, mainly the cost of the two air training schemes, to be covered by a final Mutual AidAppropriation.(hi) A call on a loan, exactly on all fours with what is proposed forthe United States, of one-tenth the American figure;i.e., $500 millions.
(c) There remains the case of South Africa, which has made so far anotoriously inadequate contribution compared with any other partof the Commonwealth. They should be expected to make a retro-spective contribution of  50 millions in gold to our costs of the war.56. This would relieve us altogether of about  1,800 millions of theburden of our war debt. On a further  1,500 millions, the interest cost wouldbe fixed at  15 millions a year with capital repayment out of special exports of 30 millions a year beginning five years after the war. Our gold and dollar reserves, after taking account of the proposed retrospective Lend-Lease, would start at&apos; a level more than double what they were at the beginning of the war,though they would rapidly melt away in the first year or two after the war; andthe excess of our liquid overseas liability over our reserves (after clearing upthe position of the non-sterling area) should not be much greater than pre-war(and appreciably less in real value after allowing for the rise of prices). Weshould have lost (after dealing with the Jesse Jones loan, the Canadian loan andcertain non-sterling area balances) about  1,500 millions of our pre-war overseasassets. Altogether we might be about  100 millions a year worse off in overseasincome. This is apart from any further debt burden which we might incur bycalling on the United States and Canadian optional credits to cover an adverseposition after the war. It also assumes that the war will not continue far into1946 or beyond.57. We might deem this to be sufficient justice. Nevertheless we should still remain the only country in the Alliance left at the end of the war with itsoverseas earnings heavily mortgaged as a result of it most of the others would still find themselves in substantial profit at our expense. We should still have fought, so to speak, as the only non-mercenaries. Nevertheless, with such a settle-ment as the above we could face the economic future without any seriousanxiety -except the perennial one of knocking some energy and enterprise into our third-generation export industries and of organising the new industries which our first-generation is well qualified to conduct if the capital and theorganisation can be arranged.58. Unfortunately any such settlement is, as yet, far off. We can only hope to reach it by robust and unyielding negotiation which does not shrink fromemphasising the claims of justice on the one hand and the nature of thealternative on the other. We must probably be prepared for the appearance ofa break-down at the end of the first round. All concerned the War Cabinet, theTreasury, the Dominions Office, the Colonial Office, the India Office, the Bank ofEngland must speak in the same, persistent tones which do not admit of a doubt.VI.59. How can such proposals be presented with the best hope of convictionto the people of the United States and to the countries of the Sterling Area?This is a political, that is a psychological, question, and the best shape will onlyemerge, I expect, in the course of prolonged discussion. But the broad lines mustbe somewhat as follows : (i) We shall have been in the war and in the area of operations for longer than anyone else. In the interests of victory we freely abandonedfinancial prudence for the future. We and we alone supplementedour own resources by mortgaging the future through overseas loans.We and we alone did this,(ii) It is precisely that expenditure which we incurred in the United Statesitself whilst we were holding the fort alone for which retrospectiverepayment would be made.(iii) If, in the light of the final outcome and the full story, nothing is done to redress the position, we shall end by shouldering burdens incurredfor the common cause, such as cannot be placed even on the defeatedenemy. Our Allies will-be seeking to obtain post-war reparations fromthis small country on a scale greater than it will be practicable to puton the enemy.(iv) With such burdens upon us we cannot for several years to comeparticipate in the free international economy upon which the americans have set their hearts and which we also, no less than they,vastly prefer if it is made practicable for us
(v) Some of our American friends are at present a little too much inclined to suggest to us that we should free ourselves from these burdens bya straight unilateral repudiation or what would amount to such, if itwere to be enforced without the offer- of a reasonable alternative(e.g. something like what is suggested above for those countries whichdecline the option without, however, having first offered them the option).   In our view we cannot do this (a) for reasons of honour;(b) for reasons of justice, since the above would certainly not lead toa fair re-distribution of the costs of the war;(c) for reasons of practice, since it would not be practicable, forexample, to deprive all the sterling countries of the liquid useof the whole of their currency reserves held with us.So far from this course contributing to the solution of a free inter-national economy, it would widen the field within which the strictestcontrols over foreign trade would continue to be necessary.(vi) It is only by a more comprehensive settlement, which attempts to offereveryone what is reasonable, and so far as we can make it, fair, thatthe financial consequences of the war can be liquidated. This is the aim, namely, that as between the partners to the war, its financialconsequences, in so far as they affect future economic intercoursebetween them, should be so far as possible liquidated. These wordssum up the final purpose. Strict fairness will not be possible. Onour own proposals we shall continue to carry burdens from whichothers will be freed. But the alternative mentioned in (v) above goesaltogether too far and would shift unfairness at least as much as itdiminished it.(vii) The outcome of the war should not be such that the financial weakness of certain of the partners tempts other partners to use their financial strength to put on pressure to secure their own way.(viii) Thus no fair solution can be reached without the participation of the americans.  The help asked from them is on relatively so small a scalethat it costs them almost literally nothing.  It enables them to disposeover a period of a foreign surplus far below what they are likely inany case to develop, a surplus of which in any case they will have tofind means of riddance.   The amount of the contribution proposed($3 billion) is the cost of the war to the United States for a fortnight;to forgo good prospects for the sake of this saving would be surelyto spoil the ship of Victory and Peace for a coat of paint.   Is there any alternative way in which they can get better value ?   Under theseproposals they can wind up the financial side of the war leaving behinda sense of justice between the partners; and all of us become freeforthwith to participate in the free international economy which isone of the prime objects of American policy.   They will never havea better chance of a wise act at so modest a cost,(ix) It is essential that the settlement should not take the form of a unilateraldecision on our part.   It must be the result of a joint discussion andone which commends itself as fair to the general judgment of theAllied Nations.   For only so can recrimination be avoided and onlyso can we, with a good conscience, make an enforced settlement on any,if there be any such at the last, who, being offered an arrangement,which has commended itself as fair to the general judgment of theNations, decide to stand out.(x) It is not the money that the Americans will grudge.    They will spillmuch more for worse causes.  If, in spite of the confused vapours andincorrigible ignorance which surround and condition all public discus-sion in the United States, the people of the United States can bebrought to see the thing in its true light, looking back to what has happened and forward to what should happen, we need not doubt their approval.60. We could, I suppose, fall back on to a variant of the above by which the13 billion from the United States was not freely contributed as retrospectiveIcnd-lease, but was provided on the same terms as trie proposed credit of $5 billion,which would then become $8 billion, all the rest of the settlement remaining thesame. I do not think that the financial consequences of this would be insupport-ahle.   It will be noticed that this proposal approximates to the least dangerous
version of Temptation outlined in paragraph 39 above. But politically andpsychologically it would be greatly inferior. It would prejudice our approach to &quot;the Sterling Area countries for their contributions, which could no longer berepresented as part of a general, agreed re-distribution of the financial burdens ofthe war. I should expect that the grander version would be carried more easilywith the general opinion of the world than the meaner version. The americans would have lost- the sense of magnanimity for a financial benefit which is useless tothem and even perhaps injurious. This variant would only appeal to those whobelieve that their duty to God and to mankind requires that every action must beat least dressed up to look like &quot; business.&quot;VII.61. The time for opening this discussion in Washington will not arrive untilthe German war is over, the San Francisco Conference finished, the Sixth Lend-Lease Appropriation voted, and the Bretton Woods Plan through Congress. Thisprobably means that the beginning of September is the earliest practicable date.62. The most appropriate form of presentation will need very careful thought. The psychological mistakes of the Balfour Note after the last war mustbe avoided. For this reason the appeal to justice must not seem to imply that wehave suffered injustice, or indeed anjdhing but generosity, at the hands of theUnited States hitherto. The proposals must be presented, rather, as a means ofliquidating the financial consequences of the war in a way which will allow thewhole of the Sterling Area to enter, with the least possible delay, into a free inter-national economy of the type which the Americans have put into the front of theirdesired policy; and as a means, also, of putting pressure on certain Sterling area countries to collaborate by taking a juster share of the financial burdens of thewar than they have yet accepted. If the Americans desire to make their contri-bution contingent on an at least equal contribution from the Sterling area countries, we should welcome such a condition.63. The advent of a new President and a new group of intimate WhiteHouse advisers make it difficult to indicate the best channel of approach, until thenew regime has settled down and we have learnt more about it. But-, if it ispossible, a paper should be passed in the first instance to the President and his principal advisers at the State Department and the Treasury, without and preliminary soundings at lower levels or in other quarters. It will be necessaryin any case to discuss with the F.E.A. at an early date the many difficult problems arising out of the winding-up of Lend-Lease and Reciprocal Aid. The majorStage III discussions could perhaps take place conveniently under cover of themore routine Lend-Lease conversations which will be required in any case withthe avowed purpose of preparing the way for winding up the Lend-Lease system with the least possible delay.KEYNES.3rd April, 1945.
