THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT218SECRET: - Copy No. O Q-- Hi "to  BE  KEPT  UNDERLOCK  AND  key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this documentTHE  SHIPPING  POSITION.(All skipping figures refer to non-tanker vessels, and are in gross tons unless otherwise stated.   Imports are reckoned in tons of 20 cwt.)WHILE the United Nations shipping position is improving and likely tocontinue doing so. the British import position is becoming steadily worse.Imports into the United Kingdom.In 1937 we imported nearly 5 million tons a month. After the inevitabledislocation at the outbreak of war, our imports in the summer of 1940 recoveredto about 4 million tons a month. Military demands were light and sinkings low.With the loss of France and Scandinavia, and the entry of Italy into the war,,with the resultant closing of the Mediterranean, our imports dropped to about^ million tons a month. This was not only because we had to fetch supplies frommore distant sources over more circuitous routes; increased despatches to theMiddle East had made a serious inroad into our importing tonnage. The entry of Russia and Japan into the war and the growing threat to Egypt imposed more severe calls on our shipping. Despatches to the Middle East, India andAustralasia increased, supplies had to be sent to Russia, and in the summer of1942 the United Nations tonnage primarily employed on military or quasi-military purposes rose to something like 14 million gross tons. Americanresources did not make up for increased demands and our imports dropped to2 million tons a month. In the Autumn came &apos;; Torch.&quot; using 2-2^- million grosstons of cargo shipping alone, of which we contributed more than half. This hasresulted in our imports dropping in the 4 months, November to February, to a.record low level of 1^ million tons a month.Thus our imports in the last 4 months have been only a quarter of the total in a good pre-war year, half what they averaged in 1941 (and for that matter in.1918). and only three-fifths of the monthly average in the first ten months of 1942.United Kingdom import fleet.Amongst the many deleterious factors which have caused this appalling drop in imports, the outstanding one is simply that the ships have not been made availablefor bringing goods to this country. Since the beginning of the war losses of allkinds- have reduced our ocean-going fleet of non-tanker tonnage under the british flag from 14^ million gross tons to 12 million tons. (We have now, in addition.2\ million tons of foreign shipping on time-charter, but in peace-time foreignshipping also worked for us.) But it is not these losses which have caused the threat to our imports; it is the increasing demands upon our shipping for military purposes. In peace-time the equivalent of perhaps 12 million gross tons of full-time, fully laden shipping were importing to the United Kingdom. To-day wehave only 3 million gross tons of shipping freely available for bringing supplies[25138]
from America and other convenient sources. These 3 million tons bring in about three-quarters of our imports. For the rest we rely on whatever can be brought back by vessels on their return journeys from military errands. War-time delays(convoys, ports, routeing, &amp;c.) fade into insignificance compared with this brutefact that we are trying with the equivalent of about one-third of the normal fleet to feed this country and maintain it in full war production. The impressionmust be dispelled that the bulk of our ships are importing to this country and that only a small fraction is grudgingly allotted to the Services. Only one-fifth of theBritish-controlled fleet, or one-eighth of the United Nations fleet, is now whollyreserved for supplying the essential needs of the United Kingdom.Owing to the large losses of shipping in the early part of 1942 and the factthat American shipbuilding has only exhibited its big rise in the latter half ofthe year, the United Nations fleet at the end of January 1943 was barely amillion tons greater than when Japan entered the war. With all the extramilitary demands which have emerged since then, it is not surprising that our imports, which have always been regarded as a sort of inverted residuary legatee,have suffered sevei&apos;ely.  But this cannot go on.Import Requirements.In peace time about two-fifths of our imports were in the category whichwould to-day come under the Ministry of Food, as against three-fifths in the purview of the Ministry of Production.The Ministry of Food has been cut by about one-half. Fruit, vegetables and feeding stuffs have been virtually eliminated, and sugar imports halved. Muchof the strenuous effort of the Minister of Agriculture has been devoted to replacing the animal feeding stuffs we used to import. Even so. the output of meat, bacon and eggs has dropped to two-thirds. Despite the large increase in the wheat crop,it still provides only one-third to two-fifths of our total wheat consumption.Whether measured in calories or protein, considerably more than half the food ofour 47 million people still has to be imported from overseas.Notwithstanding the need to maintain our imports of metals, we have, on theMinistry of Production side as a whole, restricted our consumption of imports to. about two-fifths of the 1937 level. Timber has been reduced to one-fifrh,iron-ore to one-third, paper and paper-making materials to one-sixth. imported materials used for purely civilian purposes are now negligible, and, unless we&apos;reduce munitions production (already drastically pruned) by a considerableamount, there is no hope of further notable economies on the Ministry ofProduction programme.Thus we must have nearly a million tons of food imports a month and overa million tons of raw materials. Together with finished munitions, &amp;c, thisbrings us up to something like &apos;2\ million tons a month, corresponding to the27-million-ton minimum import programme.Stocks.In 1941 our imports averaged just over 2^ million tons a month; war-timerestrictions on consumption had taken effect and we built up stocks fromIf million to 4 million tons over and above the minimum safety level laid downby the War Cabinet and described by Dr. Stacy May, the American economicanalyst, as the &quot; bedrock minimum.&quot; When our imports dropped to 2 million tons a month in the first 10 months of 1942 these stocks fell by nearly If million tons. The recent fall in imports to 1^ million tons a month has slashed our stocksfurther by about 2\ million tons despite every expedient, and by April it seems likely that stocks will be nearly 1 million tons below the minimum safety level.With these stocks, industry will not come to a stop, but we shall be living fromhand to mouth. Any further drop and the wheels would cease to turn and rationswould be jeopardised. When we observe the enormous cost in imports of militaryoperations (&quot; Torch &quot; has been costing us about \ million tons of imports a month),and the inevitable uncertainties of. forecasting imports (the actual imports in thethree months November, December and January averaged 300,000 tons less thanforecasts made only a fortnight before the end of each month), it is plain thatAve could not undertake new military undertakings with stocks at the present levels. Even if ships are more plentiful later in the year, which is none too certain,it may be hard to find escorts. Only if we can build up our stocks to something like the 1942 level shall we be in a position to seize our opportunities in the summer and autumn. For this we must increase our imports to well over 2 million tons a month.
American Assistance.When the Minister of Production was in Washington, the President agreedthat our imports should be maintained at a level of about 27 million tons(2^ million tons a month), and said that he had been advised that 300,000 dead-weight tons of extra American shipping a month should suffice for this purpose.The first few months he said would be tight, but he would see that our imports were maintained over the year. Recently we received from the War ShippingAdministration their interpretation of the Presidents promise. It was hedgedin by numerous provisos, and even so only offered us additional cargo spacetotalling 900,000 tons in the first five months, i.e., 180,000 tons a month-nottonnage, whose cumulative value until it is sunk is of course vastly greater. Thisproposal was strenuously resisted by the Minister of War Transport, and he hasnow obtained a greatly improved offer equivalent to something like If million tonsof additional cargo loading space in the five months (which would bring in nearly300,000 tons a month in the first half of the year); but these promises were still not unconditional nor did we get tonnage rather than cargo space. Furthermore,this cargo space was only to build up to important figures in the second quarter.Other Expedients.In order to escape from our immediate dilemma it has been decided that notmore than 40 ships instead of 90 a month can be sent to the Indian Ocean theatres.The advantage of this saving is cumulative. We gain 50 ships in the first month,another 50 in the second, and so on up to the 6-8 months which the normal roundvoyage takes. It is hoped that in the first six months of the year this measure will increase our imports by an average of something over 300,000 tons a month.Thus with the 1-4 millions a month which, allowing for the summer months, we hope to bring in with our normal importing fleet, the 300,000 tons monthly saved from the Indian Ocean fleet and the 300,000 tons monthly of new help promisedfrom America we may come somewhere near the 2 million mark and1 keep ourheads above water. But it will be a close thing. We cannot afford to forgo asingle ton.A [location of Shipping.The anomaly of the position is brought home to us if we compare the amountof tonnage built by the United Nations with the amount lost. Since the middleof 1942 there has always been a credit balance; in the last three months buildinghas exceeded sinkings by over \ million tons a month. American construction isscheduled to rise a good 50 per cent, above the January level, so that, unless therate of sinkings in 1943 rises to twice the 1942 level, the Allied fleet shouldsteadily increase. Despite this, as has been shown, the United Kingdom iscompelled to scrape every reserve for importing tonnage. The reason is, of course,that the British and American merchant fleets are not pooled. British and canadian building amounts to only about 160,000 tons a month, whereas Americanbuilding is scheduled to rise from about 600,000 tons in January to over900,000 tons a month in the last three-quarters of the year. Meanwhile, british shipping operates in all the dangerous areas, whereas American shipping ispredominantly in the safer regions far from the U-boat bases; and the americans are reluctant to allow their ships in dangerous waters such as the Mediterranean.In 1942 we lost 3 - 9 million tons and built 1 - 9 million tons a net loss of 2 million tons. In the same period America lost 1-6 million tons and built 4-3 million tons a net gain of 2-7 million tons. Our tonnage constantly dwindles, the Americanincreases. This tonnage is not treated as freely interchangeable and distributedaccording to needs. The American services claim a prior call oil all Americanbuilding. United States imports form such a small proportion of their total consumption that it is difficult for American Service men to realise the importance,and indeed urgent need, of British imports, on which we rely for something likehalf our food and vital raw materials.It is essential to bring home to our friends in the United States that ourminimum imports must be considered an absolute first charge on Allied shipping;that they are as vital to the war effort as supplies to the various theatres North-West Africa has recently been receiving about three-quarters as much cargoshipping each month as the whole of the United Kingdom; one-eighthof the Allied fleet is not a great fraction to reserve for United kingdom imports, to maintain a great munitions output, as well as 44 million civilians,and 3 millions in the Services.   Our own fleet is diminished by operating.
before and after America came into the war, in the most dangerous waters..We have undertaken arduous and essential operations encouraged by the belief that we could rely on American shipbuilding to see us through. Butwe must know where we stand. We cannot live from hand to mouth on promises&apos;,limited by provisos. This not only prevents planning and makes the use of shipsless economical, it may, in the long run, even imperil good relations. Unless wecan get a satisfactory long-term settlement, British ships will have to be withdrawn from their present military service even though our agreed operations are crippled or prejudiced.
