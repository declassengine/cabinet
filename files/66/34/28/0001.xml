V1. The operations in French North Africa have brought to the lore the problems ofthe civil administration of territory liberated from the enemy or from enemy influence,and various bodies have been created to deal with the different questions arising, ofwhich the Committee of the Combined Boards in Washington, and the War CabinetCommittee on Allied African Economic Affairs, may be cited as examples.2. The above events, and the consideration that is now being given to the problemsof civil administration which may arise from operations in 1943, have promptedme to place on record in this Paper a short account of the constitution and work ofthe War Office Administration of Territories (Europe) Committee, which has now beenin existence some months. I feel that this will be of general interest, and I also think it important that the existence and work of the Committee should be generally known, so that the possibility of duplication of work and plans in the futuremay be avoided.Origins of Committee.3. The Committee (known for short as the A.T. (E) Committee) originated in ameeting under the Chairmanship of Sir Edward Bridges held at the War cabinet offices on 23rd June, 1942, which was attended by representatives from the ForeignOffice, War Office and Home Forces. The meeting agreed that the War Office.shouldbe primarily responsible for the preparation of a scheme for the civil administrationofoccupied areas, since it was essential that this scheme should meet military requirements.Terms of Reference.4. I accordingly set up the A.T. (E) Committee at the end of June, 1942, withthe following terms of reference:  &quot; To consider, in conjunction with the Force Commanders concerned andwith other Government Departments at the appropriate stages, the steps-necessary on military grounds to ensure efficient civil administration of the territory liberatedin Europe as the result of operations&apos;by forces of the United Nations.For this purpose the necessary contact will be maintained with the AlliedGovernments concerned, the Principal Administrative Officers Committee and theCivil Affairs Committee of-the U.S.A. Headquarters in the United Kingdom,&apos;&apos;A decision of the Chiefs of Staff on 12th November, 1942, ruled That operationswith objectives on the Mediterranean coast of Europe should be regarded as outsidethe Committee&apos;s sphere unless otherwise directed.Composition.5. The Committee works under the Chairmanship of the Permanent Under-Secretaryof the War Office, and in addition to War Office members consists of five U.S. Armyrepresentatives,-Mr. A. N. Steyne, of .the American Embassy, Sir Orme Sargent, ofthe Foreign Office, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross;(or his deputy), of the Board of Trade and-Inter-rAllied (Relief Organizations, and the Deputy Major-General in charge.of Adminis-^ration, Home Forces. ; Close touch is maintained with other Government Departmentsconcerned, representatives from which attend meetings as the occasion-demands. Inaddition, as: stated below,, contact willbe^maintained with the: supply and* other ministriesthrough the&apos;Shipping and Supply Sub-Committee which is being set up.
2Civil Affairs Organization.6. It is anticipated that, when operations begin, there will be a Civil Affairs officer on the staff of the Supreme Commander, and that there will be a civil affairs section on the staff of British and American Headquarters. The chief British Civil AffairsOfficer may either remain in this country and send his deputy overseas, or vice versa.In the meantime a Deputy Chief Civil Affairs Officer, with appropriate staff, has beenappointed in the War Office, to work out the detailed plans lor civil administration in areas within the British zone of military operations. He works in close touch with hisAmerican counterpart, who is also a member of the Committee. Courses have been started to train suitable personnel, drawn from both military and civilian sources, forthe work of administration and military government in areas of Europe which maybe liberated or occupied by our forces as the result of future operations.Relief Planning.7. The Committee has accepted the principle that, in areas of military occupation,the British and American military authorities must make such provision for civilianrelief as is possible in the exigencies of operations, until such time as this matter canbe handed. over either to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administrationor to the Allied Governments restored to their own countries. In conjunction with theRelief Department of the Board of Trade and the Ministries of Food and Health,considerable progress has been made in estimating the minimum requirements offood, medical stores and equipment needed for the above purposes. arrangements have been made with the Ministry of Food for the earmarking of certain minimumessential foods for the initial phases of operations, and the medical requirements forthe same period are now under consideration by the Ministry of Supply.Other work in hand.8. Active planning is being undertaken to deal with the problems likely to arise in connection with finance, currency and banking, transportation, communications,propaganda, press and censorship, air raid precautions and protection against gasattacks. A detailed appreciation of the problems likely to arise in connection withthe establishment of law and order has been drawn up by the legal adviser to theForeign Office and the JAG. of the American Headquarters in London, and has beenapproved by the Committee.Shipping and Supply Sub-Committee.9. It is, of course, not possible to forecast accurately the duration of the period for which the military authorities will necessarily be responsible for relief and for assisting in restoring the normal life of the country. Although the military will naturallywish to hand over these matters to national governments or a relief administration as early as possible, it is clear that much forward planning, in conjunction with the WarOffice, on matters of supply and shipping must take place if civil administration is towork smoothly during the phase of military responsibility and subsequently. With theconsent of the Departments concerned I am, therefore, setting up a Shipping and SupplySub-Committee of.the main committee, with representatives from the Ministries ofProduction, Supply, Food and War Transport and the.Relief Department of the Boardof Trade, and an American representative. This sub-committee will work under thechairmanship of the Vice-Quarter-Master-General, and it will have very wide terms ofreference, so that, whilst concerned in the first place with the shipping and supplyproblems of the operations for which the main committee is planning, it may extend its work to coyer similar problems likely to arise out of the general liberation of territories from the enemy. In order to secure the fullest possible liaison I have asked the Cabinet Secretariat to provide a Joint Secretary for the Sub-Committee.Conclusion.10. In drawing up their plans for dealing with the many problems outlined above, thesuccessful solution of which may materially affect the course of operations, the Committeeis endeavouring&apos;- -       - : -(a) to ensure that the same principfes are adopted in.both British and American zonesin future operations on the Continent; ,     , ..; to make the fullest, use, consistent with security, of the knowledge, personnel andV, co-operation of the Allied Governments and the Fighting French . organization,. in London; .:- ......        to secure, as far as relief is concerned, a smooth carry-over, at the appropriate time,from military to civilian administration. 1,
As to (a), the considerable American representation on the Committee, their participation in discussions, and their agreement with the decisions reached, should result in substantialuniformity of treatment of similar problems by the two Armies.As regards (b) the stage has been reached where it is necessary, if further progress is tobe made, to open discussions with the Allied Governments and the French national committee (on a hypothetical basis not connected with specific operations) about the variousadministrative problems with which the Committee is concerned. Consent to such discussionsfrom the United States Government has been received through the representative on theCommittee from the American Embassy, and has been endorsed by the Foreign Secretary,and discussions will shortly be opened by the Deputy Chief Civil Affairs Officer, in con-junction with the Foreign Office and the Relief Department of the Board of Trade.As regards (c) close contact has from an early stage been maintained by the representa-tives of the Relief Department on the Committee and by continuous liaison between theRelief Department and the Deputy Chief Civil Affairs Officer. The setting up of theShipping and Supply Sub-Committee, referred to in paragraph 9 above, will, it is anticipated,facilitate the transference of military responsibility for relief and civil administration to other authorities at the appropriate time.P.
