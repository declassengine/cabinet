THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1943.SECRET. /     Copy No. 3W.P. (43) 68.February 16, 1943.WAR CABINET.AIRFIELD CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.AT their meeting on the 20th January (W.M. (43) 12th Conclusions,Minute 4 (2)) the War Cabinet invited the Secretary of State for Air and myselfto give further consideration to the labour requirements of the airfieldconstruction programme in the light of the new programme of aircraft productionin this country.2. The Secretary of State for Air, having reviewed his requirements inthe light of the latest available information, proposes to continue work on all the airfields now under construction, and to start from April or May onwards the 8 new airfields referred to in paragraph 3 (b) of W.P. (43) 23. For this programme and for miscellaneous work other than the construction of newairfields, he asks for the following building labour force : January-MarchApril    ......May     ......June-SeptemberOctober-DecemberRequired for   Required for rest8 new airfields,   of programme. Total.115,000 115,000108,000 110,00096,000 101,00091,000 101,00072.000-75.000 82,00ft2,0005,00010,00010,000falling to7,0003. I have discussed the matter with him in the light of the expansion programme for the Metropolitan Air Force, revised on the basis of the new production programme, and in the light of the latest information available asto the proposed movement of United States Air Forces to this country. On this basis I consider that all the airfields now under construction will be needed, butthat in some cases the dates for completion might be postponed from the latermonths of 1943 to the earlier months of 1944. Only 4,200 men are at presentemployed on those airfields, the completion dates for which might be postponedin this way, and the Secretary of State for Air has satisfied me that it wouldbe very wasteful of man-power over the period as a whole to close down any ofthese works or to attempt to carry them on with smaller numbers. To slow downany of the other work in hand would result in a failure to meet requirements by september 1943.4. The Air Ministry building labour force has amounted to about 115,000since the 1st January. I recommend, therefore, that it should remain at this figureuntil the end of March, as proposed by the Secretary of State for Air, whereasmy earlier proposal in W.P. (43) 23 was that it should fall to 100,000 at the endof February and 90,000 at the end of March. I am unable to recommend any reduction in the other programmes, and as a result the total labour force requiredfor the Government building programme as a whole would become, by the end ofMarch, 365,600 as against an estimate of 343,000 men available, i.e., there would be[25043]
a deficiency of 22,600 men. The Minister of Labour and National Service advisesme that this could be made good temporarily without affecting the intake into theForces, i.e., up to the 31st March, 1943, he could forgo part of the proposed intakefrom the building industry by drawing greater numbers from other sources. Butif the planned intake into the Forces is to be maintained subsequently, it would benecessary to call up men from the building industry during the following monthsat the present planned rate of some 15,000 a month, with additions to make good the arrears.5. I am not yet able to submit definite proposals for the period after March,but I can say at once that it will not be possible to meet the full Air Ministryrequirements as stated in paragraph 2 above, together with the needs of the restof the Government building programme, from the labour force that will inthese circumstances be available. When working out proposals for the remainder of the year, I shall consider further with the Secretary of State for Air thepossibility of spreading part of the work of his programme into the earlier monthsof 1944, as suggested in paragraph 3 above, with a view to reducing the labour requirements for the later months of 1943. But this can, in any case, afford onlya limited measure of relief, and the crucial question will be whether it is or isnot necessary to construct the 8 new airfields referred to in paragraph 2 above,as well as the rest of the Air Ministry programme. If it is decided to constructthese airfields with civilian labour, it will be necessary either to make further serious cuts in other parts of the building programme which does not seem likelyto be practicable or to modify present plans for the call-up of men from thebuilding industry, not only temporarily, but for the greater part of 1943.6. The War Cabinet decided at their meeting on the 17th December(W.M. (42) 170th Conclusions, Minute 1 (2) (a)) that, except in so far as new projects might be individually authorised by the Minister of Defence, airfieldconstruction should, for the time being, be limited to the completion of the106 airfields already under construction. In accordance with this decision theSecretary of State for Air is submitting his proposals in regard to the 8 proposed new airfields to the Minister of Defence.O.
