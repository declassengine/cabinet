Annex.J.I.C. (43) 64 (Final).February 15, 1943.THE GERMAN MILITARY SITUATION.Report by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.We have been instructed by the Chiefs of Staff &quot; To prepare an appreciation of the present German military situation,with particular reference to the situation which would arise if the GermanEastern Front were to collapse and the Russian Armies were to press forwardwestwards.&quot;The following is our appreciation :  Part I.-The Situation To-day.1. Any appreciation of the German military situation presents not one buttwo problems. We have to assess the strength, weakness, plans and intentionsnot only of Germany, but also of Russia, about which we still know little. Onsuch evidence, however, as is available to us. we think that the Russian Armystill possesses considerable superiority in numbers; that.Russia&apos;s munitionsposition is satisfactory; that her administrative services and her transport are reasonably efficient and that food supplies are adequate for the armed forces and essential civilian labour. The Russian High Command have recently showngreat ability in the strategic employment of their forces. We believe that moraleon the home front and in the armed forces is high.2. Germany is fighting on land in Russia and Tunisia. She is holdingdown practically the whole of Continental Europe from the Pyrenees to theArctic Circle and from the north of Norway to Greece, with the exception ofItaly, Roumania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Finland her weakening anddiscontented allies. Last autumn she was fighting in Russia on a, front, excludingFinland, of 2,400 miles with the equivalent of some 200 divisions, includingsatellite formations.t She is now suffering a succession of major defeats inRussia. She has already lost the equivalent of 40 divisions. Her net loss, taking into account divisions moved from France to Russia since November, is some25 divisions. Once the remains of her forces in the Caucasus have beenextricated or liquidated, she will be back on, and in places behind, the line fromwhich she started in 1942. some 1,400 miles in length, with, at best, the equivalent of about 160 divisions. Many of the formations will be under strength, and someof those in the south will almost certainly be gravely lacking in equipment and&apos;transport. The Germans held this front in the winter and spring of 1941-42with some 180 divisions, but at higher strength and well equipped. Even withthis force, the German Army was unable to undertake offensive operations on more than one sector of the Russian Front. The conclusion is inevitable that, at best from her point of view, with the weaker forces now available, Germany couldwithdraw no troops from this front for operations elsewhere. In fact, theRussians have already driven great breaches in the existing German lines. TheGerman retreat now being carried out is not a withdrawal according to plan.There is, as yet, no sign of the Germans being able to slow down the russian advance.3. The German garrisons in Occupied Europe are already dangerously weak.The whole of France and the Low Countries now have 34 divisions; the majorityof which are of low category. Norway has 10 divisions, of which half are coastaldefence troops. The Balkans have only one offensive division in the Germangarrison of 9 divisions. In Germany itself there is little in the way of offensivereserves which can be called upon to fight in Russia, though there are a number of low-grade defensive divisions which might be used elsewhere in the last resort.f Two Italian, Roumanian or Hungarian divisions are taken to equal in value one Germandivision, and the term &quot; Axis division &quot; represents one German or two satellite divisions.
4. In order to meet further calls for troops for the Russian Front, therefore,Germany can only find them from the occupied territories; but if she does so shewill finally endanger the defences of Occupied Europe and her control over it.5. It is unlikely that Germany will try to withdraw any of her forces (con-sisting of some 7 divisions) from North Africa. If these divisions are forced to evacuate (and if any of them are able to do so) they are unlikely to have anyoffensive value, until re-equipped.6. We estimate that for the summer campaign of 1943 the German AirForce will have available a front-line strength of some 3,500 to 4,000 operational aircraft, assuming that owing to air activity by the Allies on all three fronts,Germany is given no respite to build up between now and the spring. This force will have little depth, and the quality of the crews is likely to be inferior to thatof 1942.Of the above force, the German Air Force are likely to make available for theRussian Front a maximum force of 2,000 operational aircraft. This compares with a figure of nearly 3,000 for the opening of the summer campaign in 1942.We estimate that the German Air Force will have to maintain a minimum forceof 1,000 aircraft to meet their commitments on the Western Front. We alsoestimate that they will have to maintain a minimum of 750 aircraft on theMediterranean Front. This figure will be insufficient if they are called upon to face a vigorous Allied offensive in that area.It will be seen, therefore, that the German Air Force will have no marginfor strategic reserve. On the contrary, they are unlikely to be able to meet the commitments of all three theatres of war.7. The loss of so many important centres of communication and distribution in Southern Russia must have resulted in vast losses of material and serious location of the German supply organisation.8. We have not the means of making as close an estimate of the numbers of *Russian formations as we can make of the numbers of German divisions, but weestimated that the Russian force facing the Germans in October 1942 was the equivalent of 240 divisions, liven assuming that the Russians have since sufferedcasualties as great as the German losses, wre are left with a figure for the russian armies facing the Germans of at least 200 divisions.9. Information as to the strength of the Russian Air Force is meagre. It isthought, however, that for next year&apos;s campaign against the Germans theRussians are likely to have an operational strength of 4,500 to 5,000 aircraft.Admittedly the technical and administrative efficiency of the Russian Air force is inferior to the German, but the Russian crews and aircraft can and do giveadequate support to their land forces.10. Apart from the military situation described above, the following factorsaffect Germany&apos;s situation to-day. Economic shortages are making themselvesincreasingly felt in Germany, and economic difficulties, particularly as regardsman-power, oil and transport, are having a growing effect on the armed forces.The subservience of the remaining European neutrals grows less. Germany must now reckon with the possibility of the defection of Italy, Hungary, roumania and Finland, or any of them. Japan can and will do little to relieve theimmediate military pressure on Germany. Meanwhile the Allied bombingoffensive continues with increasing weight. Evidence is accumulating of disagreement between the German High Command and Hitler. The only rayof light in the sombre picture confronting Germany is provided by the increasingscale of submarine attack on the shipping of the United Nations.Part II. German Strategy.11, The situation described above and, in particular, Germany&apos;s shortages in man-power, oil and transport, and the inevitable fall in the size and fightingefficiency of her land and air forces must, we believe, make it impossible for herHigh Command to carry out any offensive strategy.on land, in Russia or&apos;anywhereelse. Her sole offensive strategy will be at sea, where the submarine campaignwill be continued and, as far as possible, intensified.
12. The Russians have now been attacking continuously since NovemberThey have shown that they can plan and carry out successfully major strategicaloperations. They have proved their ability to defeat the Germans, in combination with their satellites, in mobile operations, and to overcome maintenancedifficulties over great distances. The further and more rapidly the Russiansadvance, however, the greater become their immediate administrative problemsat least until the captured railways have been regauged, whilst the Germans are&apos;at all events, falling back on their sources of supply. On the other hand, their advance has put at the disposal of the Russian Army a better railway system thanthat which served them when they began, and has so far increased the accessibilityof their bases in the Moscow-Tula area, whilst the Germans, especially if theylose Kharkov, may have been driven behind the bases from which they hithertoserviced their Front, and may thus themselves be faced with increased adminis-trative difficulties as well as losing large quantities of material, which will assistthe Russians&apos; advance. The Germans will try to gain time until the arrival ofthe thaw in March and April, which will largely immobilise both armies. Owingto the mild winter, however, the thaw this year may last only about two weeks inthe South. With the arrival of the summer the Germans will&apos;be fighting under conditions in which they have in the past proved superior to the Russians.13. The German High Command appear now to be resigned to a large-scalewithdrawal, in the face of Russian pressure. They will do their utmost to hold the Russian advance as far East as possible, if only to avoid losses of men andequipment in withdrawal and the loss of the valuable Ukraine territory. Theywould, in any case, wish to retain the strongly prepared defences in the northern and Central Sectors of the Front, though the penetration and loss of these defencesfrom Kursk southwards may make their retention impracticable. In the Souththey will wish to retain the Crimea in order to deny to the Russians facilities forbombing the oil installations. Axis shipping and other important targets in roumania. In their effort to arrest the Russian advance they will employ everyingenuity and device, such as demolition of communications. They will, ifnecessary, transfer further troops from Western Europe even at the cost of yetfurther weakening their hold over occupied territory.14. It is impossible to say whether and on what lines the Germans will beable to stabilise, in view of the present state of flux and the uncertainty as towhat will be the result of the fighting between Kursk and the Sea of Azov, and what forces the Germans wall be able to extricate from this area and fromCaucasia. If these operations are disastrous to them they may be unable to stabilise at all. The principal lines on which the Germans might attempt to stabilise are given in the attached map. In general, these lines become shorterand more easily defended as they go westward. A line making use of LakePeipus, the Pripet marshes and the River Dnieper would be considerably shorterthan that at present held and has great defensive possibilities, and could thus beheld with reduced forces. Only a withdrawal to the shortest line through Poland(Rivers Niemen, Bug, Dniester or Pruth) might enable the Germans also&apos;to release a limited number of divisions. This would, however, endanger not onlythe security of their oil supplies in Roumania but also their hold on the balkans and might even result in the defection of their satellite allies. Therefore, theresult of any such withdrawal would be so to increase Gennany&apos;s defence commit-ments in other parts of Europe as to more than absorb any divisions so released.15. It is doubtful whether the German High Command have any clear ideaof how they will find the means to put into operation any plans they may have madeto meet a large-scale Anglo-American attack, should one develop.. No strategic reserve exists for this purpose. When the attack comes, a division at a time willbe collected from one quarter or another to meet a successful landing. If thaiis insufficient, more divisions may be withdrawn from other parts of Occupiedliurope, until such time as Germany finds that in one area or another she has leftherself with insufficient forces to maintain control. This process will, we believe,be applied either, as has been suggested, to meet a British and American attack,or, should the Russian advance continue, to bolster up the Russian Front.16. Germany is likely to continue operations in North Africa until she isdefeated there; since, relatively, her commitment there pays a high dividend i&quot;the embarrassment which it causes to the Allies and is an important factoi in maintaining among the Italians the will to continue fighting. We believe,however, that German strategy in North Africa will remain defensive and aim
at the maintenance of the bridgehead in Tunisia. It will be the needs of thatdefensive strategy which will primarily govern the extent of reinforcement ofthe German forces in North Africa, if only because lack of the necessary forcesprecludes any other policy.17. Whatever Germany&apos;s intentions or plans may be, we consider that thetime has come when the possibility must be faced that the defeat she has alreadysuffered in Russia cannot be retrieved. For her campaign in Russia sheconstructed the largest and most complex military machine that has ever existed.It has been hammered and damaged to such an extent that it is questionable ifit can ever be repaired. The supply, maintenance and administration of herretreating armies may already be beyond Germany&apos;s capacity to control. Webelieve, therefore, that a situation may arise, and for which we must be prepared,in which the Germans will be unable to stabilise and hold for any length of time a line in Russia at all. If that should occur, organised German resistance inRussia might collapse.In the next part of this paper we try to forecast the conditions which would follow such a collapse.Part III.-The Effect of the Collapse of the Eastern Front.18. In the event of a collapse of organised German resistance in Russiaand of a state of affairs in which the Russians continued to advance westwards,it is likely that the Nazi regime would attempt to come to terms with Britainand America rather than with Russia. Assuming that none of the Allies were willing to have any dealings with Hitler or any other Nazi leader, we believe thatthere are only two alternatives to consider. Either the Army would succeed intaking control, or Germany would disintegrate into anarchy.19. Under the first assumption the Army might either itself form a military government and seek an armistice, or might set up some government of reputablecivilians with whom some or all of the principal Allies might be expected bythem to be prepared to treat. In the meantime the Army would do its best to holdback the Russian advance and to maintain for as long as possible the weakenedgarrisons in Occupied Territories. If the Army took control, there are three possible courses it might adopt : (a) To attempt to negotiate an armistice with Russia;(b) To attempt to negotiate an armistice with Britain and America;(c) To attempt to negotiate an  armistice simultaneously wdth all theUnited Nations.20. (a) We do not believe that a separate armistice between Russia andany organised government in Germany is probable except on dictated terms.We believe the German Army leaders would expect short shrift from Russiaand would not attempt to negotiate.(b) We and the Americans have pledged ourselves to accept no terms except&quot;unconditional surrender.&quot; Assuming that the expression means Germanylaying down her arms on all fronts, including the Russian Front, we believe that,faced with such terms, the German military leaders would, so long as they couldcontrol the situation, refuse to surrender unconditionally, would concentratetheir forces and their energies on withstanding invasion from the east, and would leave the west wide open for British and American troops to enter if they would,so that when the time for surrender came they would be at hand. It is possiblethat in such circumstances the German militar)^ leaders would invite British and american troops in and not merely allow them to enter.(c) A German offer to negotiate with all the United Nations is, we believe,,only likely if the Germans had withdrawn or been driven back from the west, sothat British and American troops were on the spot.21.   There remains to be considered a situation in which the administrationwithin Germany had broken down and the country disintegrated into anarchvThis might arise either if the Army failed to assume control of the country intime, or if, having assumed control, the Army failed subsequently to maintain its authority.[25042] .. .- c
22. The legend that is assiduously spread by German propagandists that atthe end of the last war the German Army was undefeated, and that victory wasonly snatched from it by a collapse at home, is entirely untrue. It was the certainty of the military defeat which led the German General Staff to adviseseeking an armistice. Serious disorders within Germany did not begin till later.The control of the Gestapo over the civil population to-day is far stronger thanthe control exercised by the civil authorities over the population of Germany in1918. On balance, we believe that, if a collapse in authority occurs, it will become apparent first in the retreating army and spreack thence to the civil population in Germany itself.In reaching this opinion we have taken into account the following factors which did not apply, or applied in a much smaller degree, in the last war the bombing offensive from Britain on the German homeland; the fear ofretribution among the German people; and the latent animosity of the Army and sections of the civilian population towards the Nazi Party-animosities whichmay be brought to the surface if the Army takes over control.23. History shows that the German people are well suited to authoritativegovernment, and this leads one to believe that after a breakdown of authoritythere would be a strong impetus to return to stability. On the other hand, thepeople have been controlled, regimented and repicssed now for so long that.itwould be unwise not to be prepared for a situation, lasting perhaps for several months, during which no organised government existed at all in Germany withwhich negotiations could usefully be carried on. It follows, therefore, that theAllies may be faced with a decision whether or not themselves temporarily totake control of the country until some new German regime secured effective control.24. As regards the non-German European territories now occupied byGermany, the possibility of a stable administration surviving a German collapsein Russia depends on two factors the existence of a local administration and theabsence of internal tensions. An indigenous local administration is more or lessin charge in Norw7ay. Denmark, Holland, Belgium, France, Slovakia, Croatia.Serbia and Greece. Of these, the administrations in Norway, Croatia, Serbiaand Greece, and to a less extent in Ffolland, France and Slovakia, are controlled by Quislings, and will be upset as soon as German control is removed. The dangermust be borne in mind of Allied troops becoming involved in internal conflicts.25. In Yugoslavia there are already all the elements of civil war. In theEastern Provinces the General Government and the Bohemian Protectorateadministration is wholly German, and its removal will leave a void. This applieseven more strongly to the territories which have been incorporated in the Reich.i.e., Western Poland, Alsace, Lorraine and Luxemburg, in all of which, particu-larly the first, the problem has been complicated by transfers of population.26. The problem of Albania has not been settled. We have recognised herright to independence, but we have recognised no government or authority. the greeks if left to themselves might march into Southern Albania in which casethe Yugoslavs would probably follow suit and attempt to annex Northern Albania.27. The present rulers of Bulgaria will probably make every effort to cometo terms with Britain and America before it is too late, but their chances of timingtheir approach exactly must be slender. There are strong pro-Russian and communist elements in the country, and it seems unlikely that the people will,allow the present ruling House to survive in power after twice backing the wronghorse within thirty years. On balance, we believe that Bulgaria is a country which may go over rapidly to a communist system of government, perhapsapplying for incorporation in the Soviet Union.28. A German collapse on the Eastern front would lead to panic in roumania. M. Maniu and his Peasant Party might succeed in forming a Govern-ment. He himself, however, doubts whether he would be able to hold the position for very long. The country wrould no doubt rapidly come under Russian domina-tion. Any&apos; independent Government of Roumania would be certain to startagitating for the return of Transylvania and possibly would attempt to take thelaw into their own hands.29. In Roumania, and possibly also in Bulgaria, it is to be expected thatthe propertied classes, fearing for their property, if not for their lives, will do their best to escape and new men will have to take charge.
30. In Hungary the present regime could hardly survive, but it wouldprobably try to hand over to an alternative regime, which might be formed(a) from the liberal peasant and socialist elements now in open opposition; or(b) from the Right with some such leader as Count Bethlen. Either of theseregimes would try to negotiate with this country and America, but the possibilitycannot be excluded that Order would break down and a communist regime emerge,looking to Russia for support.31. Finland would no doubt try vigorously to enlist the support of Britainand America, but she is so placed that her fate is likely primarily to depend ondecisions taken in Moscow.(Signed) V.

Lines on which the Germans might try to stabilise :  (a) Leningrad-Rzhev- -Orel-Taganrog (1,400 miles). This line was stabilisedlast spring. It was then held by 172 Axis divisions (or 8 miles perdivision), but the Germans encountered great difficulties in restingtheir forces sufficiently to carry out their spring offensive. nearly two-thirds of this line have been occupied ever since, and the defencesshould, therefore, be very strong. Events have proved this so in theCentral Sector. The same line might, therefore, be held this year byrather fewer or weaker divisions against what is likely to be a similarweight of attack. This line has, however, already been breached in several places between Orel and Taganrog.(b) Lake Peipus-River Dnieper-Sea of Azov (1,000 miles). This would be400 miles shorter and would include 175 miles of the Pripet Marshes,impassable except in winter. The River Dnieper would compensate for lack of fortifications along most of the new line.(c) Riga-River Dvina-River Dnieper-Sea of Azov (1,000 miles). This line,is no shorter than (b) above, and would mean abandoning the Germans&apos;hold on the Gulf of Finland and the airfields in Estonia and Latvia.(d) River Niemen-River Bug-River Dniester or River Pruth (850 miles).-The occupation of this line would involve the abandonment of theUkraine. It would bring the Russian forces close to Germany andthe Balkans. If, as a result, the satellite divisions deserted, the linealong the Roumanian frontier might be untenable. In that caseGermany would have to retire also from the Balkans.
