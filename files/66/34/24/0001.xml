(43) 74.February 20, 1943.WAR CABINET.THE VISITORS&apos; BAN.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of home security and the Minister of Health.LAST year the ban on pleasure visits to certain areas on the South and Eastcoasts was raised and it was announced that it would be reimposed on the1st March.The question whether its reimposition is necessary, having regard to thepresent appreciation of the invasion risk, has been considered by the Civil defence executive Sub-Committee, and at a meeting of the Sub-Committee on the18th February the Under-Secretary of State for War informed the representa-tives of the Civil Departments that the Secretary of State for War, in agreementwith the Commander-in-Chief, takes the view that the ban must be reimposedon the 1st March. It was agreed that the matter should be referred to theWar Cabinet for decision.We accordingly circulate, for the consideration of our colleagues, the attachedjoint memorandum.The matter is of some urgency as a decision must be announced to the publicbefore the 1st March.H. M.E.  B.Whitehall, February 20, 1943.[25068]
THE VISITORS&apos; BAN.THE visitors&apos; ban is a prohibition on entry into the coastal area from KinVsLynn to Littlehampton, and into the Isle of Wight, for the purpose of a holidayrecreation or pleasure, or as a casual wayfarer. There is also a ban on takineup residence in these areas, with exceptions for persons resident before the14th November, 1941, or persons taking up residence for certain purposes suchas business or employment,2. These restrictions, first applied in 1940, were designed to reduce thepopulation in the coastal areas in case of invasion, and were supplementary tothe schemes for the compulsory evacuation of certain towns.3. The visitors&apos; ban (but not the restrictions on taking up residence) was raised in the winters of 1941 and 1842, except in the Isle of Wight and fromthe Thames to Rye, The ban was suspended from the 14th November, 1941till the 15th February, 1942, and this period was subsequently extended untilthe 15th April. Last, year, in agreement with Home Forces, the visitors&apos; banwas raised on the 1st November. At the request of Home Forces it was publicly announced that it would be reimposed on the 1st March, but it was agreed atthe meeting of the Civil Defence Executive Sub-Committee on the loth October,1942, that the Civil Departments would hold themselves at liberty to raise before that date the question of the continuance of the suspension.4. Subsequently, at the request of Home Forces, and in agreement withCombined Operations and the Security Executive, the ban on visits to the Isle of wight, which had never been raised since its first imposition, was raised untilthe 1st March.5. The ban is imposed or suspended by Directions of the Regional Commis-sioners concerned under Defence Regulation 16A; further Directions by the regional Commissioners will be necessary to re-impose the ban.6. It has always been the policy that no greater restrictions should be imposed upon the general public than are actually necessary. In view of therecent appreciation of the Chiefs of Staff as to the present invasion risk, there isan evident prima facie case for continuing the existing suspension of the ban.People ought not to be prevented from visiting coastal resorts unless there is good reason, and it is to be noted that the ban excludes invalids and persons sent to thecoast on doctors&apos; orders. Moreover, unnecessary hardship ought not to be createdamong those who cater for visitors. There is such a clear case in present circum-stances for the continuance of the existing suspension that, in our view,re-imposition can only be justified if there are arguments on the other side thatoutweigh the general case for relaxation.7. The reasons for which the military desire that the ban should bere-imposed on the 1st March are (1) That the development of our own offensive operations will make itnecessary for the population of the restricted areas to be kept as lowas possible.(2) That the risk of seaborne raids in these areas also requires the reductionof the floating population.(3) That the further suspension of the ban is bound to convey the impression that the risk of invasion is off, and may have a serious effect not only upon public morale but upon the morale of the Home Guard.Offensive Operations.8.   We understand that it is the security of the preparations for offensive operations from our coasts that is in view :  (a) The visitors&apos; ban has not been imposed for security purposes. The powers given by Defence Regulation 16a provide for the giving of Directions&quot; for the purpose of meeting or hindering any actual or apprehendedattack by the enemy, or of protecting persons and property from the dangers involved in any such attack.&quot; These powers do not extend to the giving of Directions for security purposes. If there is a realneed, on military grounds, to prohibit entry into certain areas, theproper course is for special provision to lie &quot;made accordingly, either under Regulation 13a or 14, or for special powers to be taken by anew Defence Regulation.
(p) The areas from which our offensive may be mounted must include many other parts of the coast beside those affected! by the ban. If there isa real security risk, it is not enough to attempt to deal with it onlyin the areas affected by the ban. Conversely, the area from&apos; the Washto the Thames affected by the ban does not seem to be in the samecategory as the South Coast in relation to offensive preparations.(c) It is a misconception to regard the visitors&apos; ban as a safeguard from thepoint of view of military security. It merely prohibits the entry ofpersons on visits for pleasui^e, holiday or recreation. Persons whovisit the area for business or employment, to stay with a near relative,or to look after an aged or sick person as a member of his household,may enter freely; moreover, persons resident in the area may movefreely in and out and have access to telephone and telegraph facilities.The danger from the security point of view is at least as likely to comefrom the resident, whose knowledge of the locality may enable himto draw deductions from observation over a continuous period, as fromthe casual visitor who has insufficient interest or knowledge to make use of what he sees or hears. Moreover, any suggestion thatill-disposed persons or agents could be kept out by the visitors&apos; banis quite unfounded. The ban is not administered by any system ofpermits, and it is impossible for the police to do more than challengeindividuals and keep a check on arrivals at a few railway stations oroccasionally on main roads: for the rest, reliance is placed on the observance by the public of the restriction, and the deterrent effect ofoccasional prosecutions. It is easy for anyone who wants to defy theban to do so.(d) If it is suggested that the nature of our operations will attract to the coastal area enemy air attack, the answer is that it would be anentirely new departure to prevent people from going to an area merely because of the risk that they might run from air raids.Seaborne Raids.9. This argument is at variance with the most recent appreciation by theChiefs of Staff of the risk either of airborne or of seaborne raids.Effect upon morale of the public and the Home Gtiard.10.-(a) Many restrictions will remain in force in these areas, including those on taking up residence, on camping within 10 miles of the coast, onaccess to beaches, and in No. 12 Region a curfew in the coastal area,and a ban on access to various strong points and certain places on theSussex Downs. Moreover, the visitors&apos; ban has not been and would notbe raised in the coastal area of Kent, The continued suspension of theban need not be announced as for an indefinite period; it can simplybe further extended for a fixed period and the public would be unlikely to draw from the suspension any other inference than that the Govern-ment have felt justified, in the present state of affairs, in continuingfor a little longer a concession already in force. It would be made clear in the public announcement that the ban may be reimposed. atany time if the Government think it necessary, and that no specialrailway transport facilities will be provided.&apos;(b) It would be unrealistic to assume that the public is not already fully aware that invasion, although still a possibility, is not imminent atthe present time. The continued suspension of the visitors&apos; ban fora limited period would not convey to the public any more than it knowsalready. But the reimposition on the 1st March of a ban nominallyimposed for invasion reasons which, last year, when the invasiondanger was still serious, was suspended until the 15th April, wouldbe extremely difficult to justify to the public and to Paidiament; andif the public get the impression that invasion requirements areunnecessarily imposed they may refuse to respond to the advice whichit may be necessary to give them if and when the danger again becomesreal.
(c) As regards the morale of the Home Guard, we understand that the policyis to inculcate the importance of the role which the Home Guard has to perform, not in relation to a present threat of invasion, but as the!garrison upon which the defence of the country will increasinglydepend as our armies take the offensive.    We can find nothinginconsistent with such a doctrine in allowing visitors to have access!to a few seaside towns, and we find it difficult to believe that a relaxation of this kind can have serious effect on the morale of the!Home Guard.11. Our conclusion, therefore, is that there is a strong case on genera!grounds for the continuance of the present suspension of the ban.12 We understand that the Minister of War Transport feels that to allow,visits to the Isle of Wight during the spring and summer would overtax the capacity of the few passenger steamers available. That difficulty and the specialuses to which the Island is put by the military may raise special considerations in the case of the Isle of Wight; and if the continued suspension of the visitors&apos;ban is approved as a matter of policy, we would suggest that the case of the isle of Wight should be examined on its merits by the Civil Defence ExecutiveSub-Commit tee.
