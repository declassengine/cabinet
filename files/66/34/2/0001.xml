HI3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3 GOVEfcNMlM)SECRET,7.P.(43)  52 WAR CABINET6th February 1945 INDIA Copy No.Constitutional position oi Governor-General1s Councilin relation to the decision regarding Mr. Gandhi.Memorandum by the secretary of State Tor India.At their meeting on 5th February (W.M.(43) 24thConclusions, Minute 2) the War Cabinet asked to be informedwhether the action to be taken in regard to Mr. Gandhi fell within the Governor-General&apos;s discretion or was a matter forthe Governor-General in council.   The position is as follows:-1.     The detention of Mr. Gandhi was authorised under Defenceof India Rule 26(1)(b) by the Central Government, i.e. in thepresent transitional period (by virtue of the Indian GeneralClauses Act) the Governor-General in Council.2.     These rules were made under the Defence of India Act - an act made by the Central Legislature by virtue of the powers conferred by section 102 of the Government of India Act, 1935,which empowers that Legislature, if the Governor-General has declared a proclamation of Emergency, to^make laws for a province in respect to matters in the Provincial LegislativeList - which include Public Order (within the range of whichthe whole matter of course lies).3.     The detention was therefore properly ordered by theGovernor-General in Council and it follows that any revokingorder would properly be made and any other relevant decisionproperly be taken by the same authority.4.     The present issue having thus properly been brought beforethe Governor-General in Council Section 41 of the 9th Scheduleapplies, viz:-( &apos;.) If any difference of opinion arises on any questionbrought before a meeting of the Governor-General&apos;s ExecutiveCouncil, the Governor-General in Council shall be bound bythe opinion and decision of the majority of those present,and, if they are equally divided, the Governor-General orother person presiding shall have a second or casting vote.(2) Provided that, whenever any measure is proposed beforethe Governor-General in Council whereby the safety,tranquillity or interests of British India, or of any part thereof, are or may be, in the judgment of the Governor -General essentially affected and he is of opinion either that the measure proposed ought to be adopted and carriedintD execution, or that it ought to be suspended or rejected,and the majority present at a meeting of the Council dissent from that opinion, the Governor-General may, on his ownauthority and responsibility, adopt, suspend or reject themeasure in whole or in part.N.B./
The phrase &quot;in his discretion&quot; which is used invarious provisions of the Act of 1935 as a term of art-implying action to be taken without consultation ofMinisters is not used in that sense (and indeed wouldbe meaningless) in the 9th Schedule which reproducessuch sections of the old Act as aro still in force.Where it is intended in the 9th Schedule that action should be taken by the Governor-General on his own-authority the phrase used is &quot;the Governor-General&quot;tout court.L . S . il .INDI^ OFFICE.6th February 1943.
