A.F. squadrons to North Russiafor the protection of convoys.Foreign Office,24th February, 1943.ANNEX.SECRET.My dear Foreign Secretary,A. EBENo24th February, 1943.In our conversation of the 15th February you asked me toassist in getting a satisfactory settlement of the proposal tosend to the North of the Soviet Union a certain British AircraftUnit,     Following your request I telegraphed to Moscow and havenow received a reply that the Soviet Government once more carefully considered and investigated the possibilities of accommodating the number of personnel which the Air Ministrydesires to send there.     As a result of this second investigationthe Soviet Government has come to the conclusion that housingspace at the points mentioned is so -limited that it would bedifficult to accommodate there the number of people which theAir Ministry wished, and even to house the number at firstindicated to me by Sir Archibald Sinclair.     The housing conditions of late have not improved, but, on the contrary, -have worsened as a result of enemy action.In those circumstances the Soviet Government believes that it would perhaps be more prudent to cancel altogetherthe sending of the Air Force Unit in question to the North   .of the U. srs.R.     As, however, aerial protection of convoys isa matter of great importance the Soviet Government will take its/

(2)s own measures to secure the required protection,is task would be greatly facilitated if the Britishvornnent would consent to send to.the North of theS.8-.R. all the aeroplanes which it was intended shouldtransferred there, but without the personnel, so thathese machines can be used by Soviet fliers, as we haveiw no shortage of personnel.If this suggestion is agreeable to the British government Soviet Government would be very grateful if it could berried into effect.Yours sincerely,J. MAISKY.. Hon. Anthony Eden, M. C. ? 11 P. ,ecrctary of State, for Foreign Affairs.
