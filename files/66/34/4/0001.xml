This draft has been circulated semi-officially to the Ministers directly concerned, and I understand that it is generally acceptable, although two of the Ministers consulted suggest that the date under (a)should be the middle of 1945 rather than the end of 1944.Subject to consideration by my colleagues, I suggest that the draft directiveshould now be approved, and that arrangements should be made for it to bebrought up for review every three months.The issue of the directive is, of course, only intended to provide general guidance to those responsible for determining priorities for research and develop-nient, and specific directions should continue to be sought from Ministers inparticular cases of difficulty.W.
