THIS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENTPirinted for the War Cabinet.  March 1943,SECRET.Copy. No.W.P. (43) 91.March 5, 1943.WAR CABINET.STATEMENT ON AIR TRANSPORT FOR ESTIMATES DEBATE.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air and Minister without portfolio.IN accordance with War Cabinet Conclusions 36 (43) 8, we circulate herewitha draft statement on Air Transport to be made by the Government Spokesman in&apos;the Air Estimates Debate.March 5, 1943.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government are fully alive to the importance of post-warcivil air transport, particularly to a country like the United Kingdom with itsoverseas responsibilities and its dependence on overseas trade. This has beenmade clear in statements by Government spokesmen in this House and in anotherplace.2. The present war, like all wars, has acted as a forcing-house for technical development, and the potentialities of aviation in the future are very great. Wemust not, as a nation, fail to play our full part in the development of civil aviationafter the war.   This also is fully appreciated by His Majesty&apos;s Government.3. Since the outbreak of war, the plain fact is that the resources of theBritish aircraft industry have been concentrated on the production of combat andtraining types. When we look back on the urgent need in 1940 and 1941 toproduce fighters for the defence of this island and the continuing need of aircraft of the highest performance for our bombing offensive, for anti-U-boat work, forthe close support of our troops in the field, and so on, no one would question the wisdom of this policy.4. Nevertheless, the time has now arrived when His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould consider what can be done always without impairing our war effort toprepare for the return of peace, be it sooner or later. That is why the Govern-ment, as one of several preparatory steps, set up a Committee early this year under lord Brabazon of Tara to consider broadly the post-war types of civil aircraftlikely to be required.5. The Committee lost no time. Their report, which is a secret document,was received three weeks ago. They recommended that work should start imme-diately oh the design of civil aircraft of new types, which they defined, in very general terms, and on preparing for the conversion of military aircraft and forthe production of such types as are suitable for civil work.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government are grateful to Lord Brabazon and hiscolleagues on the Committee for their careful and practical review. Whateverform of international collaboration may be devised for post-war civil air transport,it will clearly be the duty of this country, both from our own and from an inter-national point of view, to play a prominent part in the production and operationof civil aircraft.(Initialled)A. H. M. S.W. A. J.[25132]
7. The aircraft manufacturing- industry is to-day our largest industry. Wepossess great technical skill and experience in aircraft and aero-engine design and construction. The types of aircraft on which we have so far concentratedare unsurpassed for quality and performance. We are confident that we can make a real contribution to the development of civil air transport after the warand it is our intention to do so. The first thing to be done is to take the necessary steps to provide aircraft of the types that will be required for passenger and goods transport after the war.8. The War Cabinet have accordingly taken the decision that the design ofa limited number of new types of civil aircraft shall proceed with the assistanceof the Government as and when it can be arranged without impairing the war effort, and that the conversion and increased production of military type,-,adaptable for civil use shall be undertaken subject to the same proviso.9. The resources of the British aircraft industry in design staff are limited,and it is only by the unceasing efforts of the designers that British technicalsuperiority over the enemy in military types has been, and will in the future be,maintained. However, we shall, in association with the industry, do our utmost to organise design staffs of the high calibre requii&apos;ed so that they may start withoutdelay on the design of some, at least, of the new types recommended and onconversion work.10. The Government are also giving close attention to the organisation ofcivil air transport on the international plane after the war. There are many different possibilities from world-wide international operation to the &quot; closedair &quot; system of the pre-war years, or even to unregulated &quot; freedom of the air.&quot;The last would inevitably mean fierce competition and the continuation of highuneconomic subsidies. In the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, some form ofinternational collaboration will be essential if the air is to be developed in theinterests of mankind as a whole, trade served, international understandingfostered, and some measure of international security gained.11. The problems are, of course, immense and cannot be solved by one country alone. We, in this country, live in a small island and our internal services can never have anything like the same importance as the internal services operatedwithin a large land area. This is one of the factors which must be taken intoaccount and it is not being overlooked.12. None of the ai rangements we have made during the war with regard to air transport in any part of the world precludes us from working out new plans.Our exploratory work is, in fact, well advanced and we are now in preliminaryconsultation with the Dominions and India, An approach to other members ofthe United Nations, including our friends in the United States, will be made assoon as possible.13. For though air transport is a young industry and its potentialities haveeverywhere fired the imagination, its organisation in the post-war world cannotbe considered in isolation but must be so framed as to be consistent, in spirit andin truth, with the principles which seem likely to govern the international economic policy of the United Nations after the war.14. To look ahead is a virtue, but not if it means to slacken on the job inhand. We shall not make that mistake. I have said enough, I hope, to show thatwe have not been inactive. I have disclosed as much as can be disclosed. For therest, the House must have confidence in us and understand, as I am sure the house will, that it would be a disservice to the national interest and might prejudice thesuccess of negotiations that have not yet started to press us to say more now.March 5. 1943.(Initialled) A.
