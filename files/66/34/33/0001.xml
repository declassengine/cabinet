(43) 83. /February 24, 1943. jWAR CABINET.CIVIL AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of aircraft Production.WE recently appointed an inter-Departmental Committee, with LordBrabazon as Chairman, to prepare outline specifications of the new types of aircraft needed for post-war air transport, to consider the conversion of existingtypes as an interim measure, and to prepare a plan to make use of spare design and productive capacity as soon as any can be made available without interferencewith war production.2. The Brabazon Committee recommended immediate action to design thefollowing new types :  (i) Multi-engined landplane for North Atlantic.(ii) Medium-size, twin-engined landplane for European and feeder services.(iii) Four-engined landplane for Empire trunk routes.(iv) Jet-propelled mail-plane for North Atlantic.(v) Small twin-engined landplane for internal services in the UnitedKingdom, Dominions and Colonies.- 3. For interim types, the Committee recommend immediate action (i) tojig and tool for additional production of the York and of the transport version of the Shetland (a large new flying-boat on order for the R.A.F.), and (ii) to design, jig and tool for a transport version of the Halifax.4. The Committee emphasise the need for a start to be made now if theproduction of civil aircraft from the end of the war onwards is to employ any appreciable number of men and if we are to be in a position to make a worthycontribution to world air transport in the post-war era.5. The problem posed by these recommendations at this stage is mainly one of priorities in the employment of design staffs. The design staffs of the aircraft industry are fully occupied at the present time either with improving the opera-tional efficiency of existing aircraft or with the design of aircraft to new militaryspecifications. It may, however, be possible from time to time to make availablesome designers for civil air transport work. We are examining in the light ofthe Brabazon report the extent to which it may be possible to transfer designstaffs and other resources to civil work, having regard to military needs, and will submit recommendations to the War Cabinet in due course.6. Meanwhile, *the Dominion and Foreign Secretaries are about to open discussions with the Dominion and American Governments about the organisationof air transport after the war. It is obviously important that, from the outset of these discussions, they should be in a position to assert that the UnitedKingdom intends to play, and will have the resources to play, a big part in post-war air transport.7. Accordingly, at a meeting on the 22nd February of the Civil AviationSub-Committee of the Committee on Reconstruction Problems, it was decided tomvite the War Cabinet to record their decision that British air transport after[25082]
the war shall be on a, scale and quality in keeping with our world position, andthat work on the design of new types of civil aircraft and on the conversion ofexisting military types should proceed under the direction of the Government as and when this can be done without impairing the war effort,8. We therefore ask the Cabinet to give approval to the proposal inparagraph 7 above and to agree to accept financial responsibility for the initiation of the programme of civil aviation upon a basis adequate to provide a minimumnumber of essential types of aircraft in the immediate post-war period.9. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is in general agreement with what isproposed, but does not feel able at this stage to accept a commitment in principlethat the production of aircraft for use in civil transport after the war shallnecessarily be financed from public funds. He therefore wishes to be consulted in the case of new types before any expenditure is incurred beyond the prototypestage, and in the case of converted military aircraft, before orders are placed for aircraft which are unlikely to be used in support of the war effort.A.
