E. BRIDGES.Offices of the War Cabinet. S.W.1,February 18, 1943.(1)Extract from a Speech by Lord Beaverbrook in the House of Lords,February 9, 1943** * * * rtf *A change has now occurred in the constitutional structure of this country,a change which has profound and far-reaching consequences. Like previousconstitutional developments it has taken place almost unnoticed and without anyparticular enactment. The changes are four-fold. One is that the House ofCommons no longer represents the constituencies in the ordinary sense. the commons have prolonged their own lives by Statute, and they have co-optednearly one hundred, members into their body without consultation with the electorate. The House of Commons was elected in 1935 on issues far different from those which confront the nation to-day. The majority of the members ofthe House of Commons were elected on peace issues and to preserve the limitationof arms. Their mandate, which they annually decide to renew, is no longer valid.The Socialists conduct their chief debates and make their chief decisions, notin the House of Commons, but in private meetings. The voting in the Lobbies is decided beforehand. Another point is that the continued existence of this parliament is dependent upon the decision of this House. The adjustment of power made by the Parliament Act is now reversed. If the House of Lords refuseto continue the life of Parliament an appeal to the constituencies would become necessary.I do not either approve or disapprove of this changed state of affairs; I onlynote that it has happened. I myself am a House of Commons man, and. I realise the limitations of this House; yet the fact of the unseen constitutional revolutionremains, and your Lordships must discharge this new duty that is imposed uponCopy No.[25056]* Hansard, cols. 950/1.
you. Here in this House resides the power and the authority to prolong this parliament or to end it, and where power is there must go responsibility. It isfor these reasons that I accept the opportunity of speaking in Secret Session withjust as urgent a desire to lay my facts before you as if I had the opportunity to speak to the public as well as to your Lordships.(2)Minute on (1) by the Attorney-General, dated February 11, 1943.Lord Beaverbrook is right in his assumption that a Bill such as those whichhave already been passed for the annual prolongation of the life of the presentHouse of Commons, could be rejected by the House of Lords. Section 2 of the parliament Act, which enables a Bill to become law in spite of rejection by theHouse of Lords if passed in three successive Sessions by the House of Commons,could not, of course, be operated in any event, but it is to be noted that Billsextending the life of the House of Commons are expressly excepted from theoperation of that Clause. In other words, even if three successive Sessions of normal life remained to a House of Commons, it could not pass into law under that Act a Bill prolonging its life if the House of Lords rejected it. The vetowith regard to such Bills was left unaffected by the Act. There are. of course,many other hypothetic uses of their powers by the House of Lords which wouldforce a constitutional crisis and, indirectly, presumably involve a general election.To give one example, they could refuse to pass the Address which is required from year to year to continue the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act in operation.This would bring to an end the Defence Regulations and Orders under which thecountry is organised for war.(Intld.)
