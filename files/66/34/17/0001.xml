eg t -ft      *THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1943.SECRET. Copy No. 33W.P. (43) 67.February 16, 1943.WAR CABINET.INTERCHANGE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION WITH THEU.S.S.R.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.AN Agreement was signed between the British and Soviet Governments onthe 29th September, 1942 (W.P. (42) 453) by which the two Governments under-took to &quot;furnish to each other on request all information, including any necessaryspecifications, plans, &amp;c, relating to weapons, devices or processes which atpresent are or in future may be employed by them for the prosecution of thewar against the common enemy. They will also furnish such informationspontaneously as regards new weapons, devices or processes which they mayemploy or which they consider would be of interest to the other Government.&quot; Itwas further provided that, &quot; if either Government considers that in the common interest there would be disadvantage in giving such information in a particular case, they shall be entitled to withhold the information in question, but in that event they will indicate the reasons which led them to take this view.&quot;2. The best way to carry out the Agreement has since been considered andthe Allied Supplies Executive, at their meeting on the 14th December, invited meto arrange inter-departmental discussions to decide whether additional technicalrepresentatives should be sent to the U.S.S.R. After discussion with the Depart-ments, I recommended that a small technical mission of high standing should goto Moscow and the recommendation was accepted by the Allied SuppliesExecutive.  It is generally agreed (a) that if the mission is to succeed in its task of obtaining as well asgiving information the proposal for it to go should be made in a communication from the Prime Minister to Mr. Stalin;(b) that the mission should be composed partly of members who would return after a short visit and partly of members who would be left behind to form the nucleus of a permanent technical mission;(c) that Sir Henry Tizard should be asked whether he would be ready to headthe mission.3. I have discussed with Sir Henry Tizard the terms on which he would beprepared to go. Fie has said that he will go provided that he has the samemeasure of discretion as he had when he went on a similar mission to the UnitedStates in 1940. At that time it was agreed that there was to be no bargainingor appearance of bargaining although it was understood that Sir Henry Tizardwould do his best to get all technical information that might possibly be of help to us. I fully support Sir Henry Tizard&apos;s request that he should have complete discretion if he is to head the mission and there is a considerable measure of agreement with this view amongst those of my colleagues whom I[25045]
have consulted, namely, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the FirstLord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of State for War, the Secretary of Statefor Air, the Minister of Supply and the Minister of Aircraft Production.4.   The Departments have prepared (i) a list of items to be disclosed;(ii) a list of items on which information cannot be disclosed, with reasons:(iii) a. list of items on which we would like information from the Russians.Such lists follow the lines of the Anglo-Soviet Agreement.5. Arrangements have been made to ensure that the Americans approve the lists. These arrangements will be completed if it is finally decided to send themission.6. The Chiefs of Staff have stressed, the importance in their view ofobtaining reciprocal information and do not wish Sir Henry Tizard to be debarred from bargaining. With this view 1 agree provided that it does not prevent him from carrying out our part of the terms of the Agreement and thathe retains full discretion as to the best method of eliciting information. At therequest of the Chiefs of Staff. I attach a minute setting out their views. (AnnexesA and B.)7. I agree with the Chiefs of Staff that the exchange of information between ourselves and the Soviet Union, since the signing of the Agreement, has beennearly all one way. The Russians are active in getting information from us andhesitant about giving us anything in return. Nevertheless, it is my opinion that,if a mission is to go, it must have the freedom of action asked for bySir Henry Tizard.8.   I ask the War Cabinet. therefoi&apos;e, for decisions on two points :  (a) whether the Head of the Mission should be given the same discretion as was given to Sir Henry Tizard on his mission to the United States in1940, it being understood that certain items cannot be disclosed for security reasons;(b) if the answer to (a) is &quot; no,&quot; whether a mission should go at all orwhether the Embassy and the No. 30 Mission, suitably reinforced, are sufficient to carry out the Agreement.0. L.Ministry of Production, S.W. 1,February 16, 1943.
Annex A.Note from Lieut.-General Sir Hastings Ismay to theMinister of Production,WITH reference to your note on the 9th February* on this subject, I aminstructed by the Chiefs of Staff to reply in the following terms :  2. They agree with the suggestion in paragraph 5 that, in order to ensurethat the Americans are kept fully informed, the Joint Staff Mission should discussthe lists with the appropriate American military or other authorities, and obtain their approval to the disclosure of any item in which they may be interested;and they will send the necessary instructions to the Joint Staff Mission when thetime arrives.3. The Chiefs of Staff also agree with your suggestion in paragraph 8 thatthe Joint Staff Mission should inform the Americans of our intention to discloseG.L. Mark III to the Russians; and they are issuing instructions accordingly.4. The Chiefs of Staff do not, however, agree with the proposal that theMission under Sir Henry Tizard should be debarred from bargaining. It sohappens that they have themselves recently had under consideration the broad principles that should govern the interchange of military information between our Mission in Moscow and the Russian authorities, and had already reachedthe conclusion that the time has come to put an end to the &quot; one-way-traffic &quot; thathas been practised over the past 18 months. Their position is explained in theattached report by the Joint Intelligence Committee, which they approve andwhich has the concurrence of Sir Archibald Clark Kerr.5. It should not be the practice of either party to withhold from the otherany information which is of value for the prosecution of the war.Up to date, we are in the position of having given much and received little;this submissive attitude cannot continue indefinitely.6. The Chiefs of Staff note that you propose to submit a memorandum tothe War Cabinet, and they ask that this minute and enclosure might be annexedthereto in order that their point of view may receive simultaneous consideration.(Signed) H. L. ISMAY.February 13, 1943.Annex B.Memorandum by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee.WE have examined a comprehensive report by the Head of the british military Mission in Moscow on the work of the Mission since its arrival in Moscoweighteen months ago.2. It is not proposed to submit the full report to the Chiefs of staff committee, but it is considered necessary to draw attention to the fact that con-siderable difficulties have been, and are still being, placed by the Russians in theway of the work of the Mission.3. Facilities which are being given by the Russians to the Americans, andeven press representatives, are being denied to the Mission. The result is thatit is placed in a most humiliating position and is rapidly losing &quot; face &quot; with allconcerned.4. We have consulted Colonel K. G. Exham, who has just returned to thiscountry, having been head of the Military Section of the Mission since the departure of Lieutenant-General F. N. Mason-Macfarlane on the 19th May, 1942,and he confirms the above.5. We are informed that Sir Archibald Clark Kerr will shortly return to moscow and that he intends to take up the whole question of exchange of infor-oiation with the Russians on the highest level, and will make use of the material* Not reproduced
contained in Admiral Miles&apos;s report. Sir A. Clark Kerr will assure the SovietGovernment that the Mission has received strict instructions to refrain fromseeking to obtain any information on Russian forces, apart from information given in the normal course of the Mission&apos;s discussion with the Russian Staffs.6.   We recommend that (a) Unless Sir A. Clark Kerr&apos;s discussions with the Soviet Government resultin a complete change of attitude towards the Military Mission, some modification to our present policy should be made, in that the element of bargaining should be introduced when information is passed to theRussians.We should continue to supply the Russians with any information which it is in our common interests for them to have, but in caseswhere information is requested by the Russians largely out ofcuriosity, some return should be demanded.(b) That the Head of the Army Section and the Head of the Air Section ofthe Mission should be of General Officer or equivalent rank.(c) If and when a new Head of the Mission is appointed, he should beprovided with a letter of introduction from the Prime Minister to premier Stalin.(d) An agreed charter should be drawn up, as a result of discussions on a high level, in which should be laid down the particular items of information,to be exchanged between the Russians and ourselves. Once such a charter had been drawn up, we should insist that the Mission haddirect and easy access to all the items contained therein.. 7.   Sir A. Clark Kerr has seen and concurred in the above recommendations.(Signed) V. C A VENDISH-B ENTINCK.E. G. N. RUSHBROOKE.F. H. N. DAVIDSON.F. F. INGLIS.R. M. C. TURNER(for C. G.
