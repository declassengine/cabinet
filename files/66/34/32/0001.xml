(42) 609 of the24th December last. Like that paper, the present report represents the agreedviews of the various Departments concerned with this question, including theService Departments.Since the last paper on morale in Germany was circulated the German army has suffered continuous reverses and heavy losses on the whole length of theEastern Front, which can no longer be concealed. Stalingrad was the greatestsingle defeat the German Army has ever suffered and the Russians have sincecontinued their advance along the whole Southern front. Rostov and Kharkovhave been recaptured. In the north land communications have been reopened withLeningrad. The Maikop oil wells and the granaries of the Kuban have been lost.The industrial Donetz basin is being abandoned and even the wheat of theUkraine is now seriously threatened. In North Africa the Afrika Corps&apos;steady retreat has continued and only Tunisia remains in Axis hands. at casablanca President Roosevelt and the Prime Minister have announced theircomplete agreement concerning their offensive plans for 1943 to ensure Germany&apos;sunconditional surrender. Germany?s European allies have shown unmistakablesigns of political wavering and military weakness. The tide of Japanesesuccesses has turned and Japan&apos;s collaboration with the Axis is far from intimate.Air raids on Germany itself have been resumed on an effective scale after thelull last autumn, and day attacks on Berlin by the Royal Air Force and onWilhelmshaven by the United States Army Air Corps have been added to theregular night raids on Germany. The intensified U-boat campaign has failedto produce decisive results and Grand Admiral Raeder has been replaced asConrmander-in-Chief of the German Navy by Admiral Doenitz.2. Faced with this situation the German authorities have embarked on.a campaign of intense &apos;&apos; backs to the wall&apos;&apos; propaganda, stressing that european.

must either hold together under German leadership or he totally destroyed by theRussians. The repressive measures by the police, Gestapo and S.S. have been intensified. A rigorous labour comb-out has been decreed, to be accompanied by the wholesale closing down of the few remaining undertakings producingunessential.goods and services. The only consoling features in the situation tothe German public are (1) the mild winter, and (2) the fact that the food situation has not yet undergone any very serious deterioration and compares favourably with the concluding stages of the last war. But the strain and anxieties of dailylife referred to in earlier reports are steadily growing and will be renderedsharper by the ever-increasing shortage of consumption goods.3. On the Home Front the shock of these developments has done much tobreak down the apathy which has hitherto been the main distinguishing feature of German civilian morale. There has been an unmistakable increase in specula-tion and in outspoken differences of opinion about the responsibility for the warand about its conduct and probable outcome. Anxiety and perplexity about themilitary situation have enlarged the audience for foreign broadcasts. the catholic Bishop of Berlin has recently gone so far as to utter an indirectcondemnation of the actions of the Nazi Government, and has given a. clearwarning that Germany must take account of Christian opinion throughout theworld in her conduct of the war. Criticism of the regime is increasing, especiallvin the bombed areas. There are indications of sporadic unrest among workers incertain factories, especially in the North and North-West. Anti-regime and pro--Communist feeling has increased. In these circumstances the presence inGermany of several million foreign workers is causing great and increasinganxiety. But there is still no evidence of organised opposition to the regime orof conscious and deliberate obstruction of the war effort.4. The speeches of German leaders on the tenth anniversary of Hitlersrise to power on the 30th January indicated that important differences of opinionexist between the Army leaders, among whom criticism of Hitler&apos;s militaryleadership is now widespread, and the party, particularly with regard to theoriginal necessity and present conduct of the Russian war. They also implieda difference of opinion between those prominent people who had hoped to patchup a peace with Russia and those who wished to obtain a compromise peace withthe Western Powers. German propaganda has found it necessary to combat theidea that an arrangement with Soviet Russia is possible. Even more strikingis the fact that for the first time it is a major preoccupation of german propaganda to prove that the Western Powers either cannot or do not desire to save Germany and Europe from Bolshevisation. Considerable sections of thepropertied classes, especially bankers, heavy industrialists and Junkers, appearalready to regard defeat as probable, and are obviously anxious to reinsure withthe Western Powers.5. Such defeatist tendencies are not yet widespread, although there is now a general realisation that Germany can no longer expect to win a completevictory. The tone of German propaganda suggests that the authorities fear thatdefeatism may gain ground, and in order to counteract it they are finding itnecessary to hold out hopes of an improvement in the military situation by next summer. By such means they appear hitherto to have secured general acceptanceof the sacrifices required for the successful prosecution of a long and bitterdefensive war.6. In the German Armed1 Forces morale is on the whole still good. Thereare, indeed, indications that the fighting spirit of the German Army is showingsign of deterioration and is losing its fanatical will to win. The German soldieris no longer convinced that German victory is a foregone conclusion, and he is beginning to lose his supreme confidence in his leaders. But there is no evidencethat the Army is becoming, demoralised, and&apos; until recently soldiers home fromthe Eastern front have in the main displayed good morale.7. In the Navy the high standard of discipline and efficiency is on the wholebeing maintained. The crews of the surface units show a fatalistic determination to fight and die if called upon, though there have been signs of lack of confidence and of offensive spirit in the High Command. With some exceptions, the personalmorale of U-boat crews remains high, and such falling off in efficiency as therehas been is due not to a decline in the fighting spirit, but to a lowering of the standards of training.
8. An- Force pilots, especially the fighter pilots, continue to show confidence in their aircraft and to remain hopeful as to the outcome of the war, althoughcomplete confidence .in final victory is no longer universal. Among the bombercrews&apos;there is evidence of a weakening of purpose, due to overwork and inadequatetraining. There is good reason to believe that the morale of ground units has been severely affected by the recent comb-out to form infantry divisions for the russian front.9. Generally speaking, German morale is passing through a much morecritical stage than in any previous winter of the war. German opinion no longerdisplays, either at the level of the masses or among the privileged classes, thatuniformity which has hitherto characterised it. and which may be regarded asthe hallmark of a successful totalitarian state. Large numbers of people have begun to compare 1943 with 1918, to ask whether the war has reached its turningpoint and to cast about for a third alternative open to the German people betweenNazi victory and Russian vengeance. This tendency is only incipient, and certainly does not betoken the imminence of any popular revolt.&apos; But, unless theRussian advance can be checked on some new&apos; defensive line in Russia, publicunrest is likely to grow. German opinion is now more responsive than at anvearlier stage of the war to the fortunes of battle at the fronts, to our air raidsand to our political warfare. In these circumstances, there is an imminent clangerof a crisis in the higher ranks of the army and administration.
