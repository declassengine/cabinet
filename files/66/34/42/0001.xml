THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;s S GOVERNMENT.S EJ RETyyy (45) 92 COPY NO.3rd March 1945.WAR    CABINET   -FORMATION OF A ROYAL AIR 1-ORCE TRANSPORT COMMAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.As the War Cabinet are aware,  transport aircraft have been in short supply throughout the war.g. The main reasons for this are,  first,  that the productive resources of the British aircraft industry have necessarily &quot;been con-cent rated on the manufacture of combat and training types and,secondly,  that allocations from the U.S.A.  have fallen belowexpectations.3. Accordingly,  the number of transport squadrons in the Royalidr Force has hitherto been small and the creation of an overheadorganisation to control their operations was not required.4V The situation is now improving.      Work is proceeding on the-production of 200 Yorks in this country and substantial numbers oftransport aircraft,   though fewer than we had hoped, will be arrivingfrom the U.S.i^.  in the corning months.      This will make possible theformation of more Royal Air Force transport squadrons and an organisation will be required to control their operations throughoutthe world.5. The Air Council have therefore decided to establish a RoyalAir Force Transport Command.      In addition to controlling theoperations of Royal Air Force transport squadrons at home,  the Commandwill be responsible for the organisation and control of strategic, air routes, for all overseas ferrying and for the reinforcement moves of squadrons to asd between overseas theatres.      The Royal Air Force FerryCommand at Montreal will become a subordinate formation,.6. The British Overseas Airways Corporation will remain a civilianorganisation if only because many of its services terminate in or pass through neutral countries.      Already, however, it has been working in close partnership with the Royal Air Force on the North atlantic route. ,&quot;   The arrangements in-aforeo-on.this route c..n be extended overthe wider field and-will ensure that.: the&apos; services and requirementsof &quot;the Corporation are integrato-d wfcth -those- of - the -new Commanclr -7* The War Cabinet would wish&apos;to know of these developments,which I propose to announce in the course of my Estimates Speech next week.A.H.M.S-.liliE-J^ini st ry.^ -L.March, 1943 *
