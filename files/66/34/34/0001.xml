This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentPrinted for the War Cabinet, February, 1943SECRETCopy No.W.P. (43) 842/\th February, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet british MILITARY ADMINISTRATION OF OCCUPIEDTERRITORIESMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR war for the information of the Cabinet I submit this account of the military adminis-tration of territories occupied by our forces.I. General Principles.The basic principle is that our Commanders are bound to act in conformity withthe Hague Conventions and may not depart therefrom without the specific authorityof His Majesty&apos;s Government, even should we occupy a territory held by an enemynot so bound.Thus on invasion the Force Commander, as the representative of the occupying power, assumes by Proclamation all legislative, judicial and administrative authority.The administrative machinery used under such a Proclamation began as something of an improvization when Sir Philip Mitchell became Chief Political Officer to middle east Command on the first occupation of Cyrenaica. In the light of experience it hasnow developed into a standard design.The normal Army Services (of supply, transport, etc.) are there to serve only theArmy they cannot undertake in addition the administration of a civilian population.For this purpose we create as and when necessary a special Army Service calledoriginally &quot; The Political Branch &quot; and more recently the &quot; Civil Affairs Branch &quot;in the Command concerned. There are now two such Branches, one in Middle East(Brigadier Hone, C.P.O.) responsible for Eritrea, Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, and one in East Africa (Major-General Lord Rennell, C.P.O.) controlling Italian Somalia,British Somaliland, the Province of the Ogaden and the Ethiopian Railway.The Chief Political Oflicer is assisted by the requisite technical staff with practical experience in all the several departments of civil and municipal government, selected from serving Army officers or obtained in co-operation with other State Departments(e.g., the Colonial Office have been of great assistance in the loan of trained adminis-trative personnel). All are given military rank since the legal basis of the administration is military.The dual objective is (a) quiet government so that the Commander may have noanxiety as to his security, and his troops may be relieved of the duty of holding down a hostile population; and (6) the mobilization and utilization of all the resources of theterritory for the furtherance of the general war effort. These objectives must be achievedwith a proper regard for the interests of the native inhabitants and the reputation abroadof His Majesty&apos;s Government.In general, the existing administrative lay-out is preserved, and the laws and courts to which the people are accustomed are retained, subject to such modification as mili-tary exigency or the just government of the people may require.All matters of general policy, as well as important questions of routine administra-tion, are referred by Commanders to London where decisions are taken in consultationwith the Departments of State concerned, either directly or through the Inter-depart-mental Committee on Occupied Territory Administration, of which the Finance Memberof the Army Council is Chairman. In the Middle East the Minister of State is in close touch with the Administration, is kept fully informed and regularly consulted. Incases of urgency where reference to London is not possible, the Commander-in-Chiefseeks and receives instructions from the Minister.
2II. Aspects of the Administrative Problem.It is not possible to deal exhaustively with all the many aspects of administration,but the following examples are typical:  (a) Italian population. Many difficult problems have arisen in the various terri-tories. Under the Italian Government the administrative system was built on a policyof lavish, not to say reckless subsidies even milk and vegetables were imported fromthe mother country. Moreover, the administration supported an excessive numberof lazy, incompetent and superfluous functionaries of all kinds. Many of these havebeen removed as internees to other African dependencies; others (after suitable selec-tion) have been absorbed into employment (as on the important American Base projects in Eritrea) or into minor administrative posts.As a result of war conditions and the removal of breadwinners by casualty orcapture, the economic life of the territories has been completely disrupted. Foodproduction and distribution have had to be rehabilitated, and internal trade in dailydomestic necessities restarted. This has been done by administrative departmentscreated for the purpose. In Italian Somalia the Italian agricultural settlements arenow producing large quantities of foodstuffs. In Eritrea, Italians have been set towork on Government land, and on the irrigation scheme at Tcnessie some 6,000 acreshave been switched from cotton to sorghum, the staple native food which has been consistently in very short supply.Education has also provided a problem. Italian education was intensely partisanand native education was neglected.   Facilities under British control are now provided.In accordance with the principle of conserving our own manpower the utmost possible use is made of the existing administrative machinery, subject, of course, toBiitish control and within the limits set by considerations of security. Thus in Eritreaafter weeding out some 3,000 ardent Fascists, some of the Italian officials are employedin suitable branches of government, such as, Public Health, Labour, Veterinary Serviceand so forth.(6) Police and Prisons. It has been found necessary to employ at the outset, under british control, a proportion of the Italian Police until the Administrations have had time to raise their own Police Force. As this Force has developed the number of italian police is progressively reduced. By this means the employment of Armyformations in security duties is greatly lessened. Thus in Somalia we have raised aGendarmerie of over 1,500 men, including camelry and motorised sections. in cyrenaica we trained a nucleus police force from refugee Senussi during the interval between our occupations, and this has now been re-inforced by a part of the LibyaArab Force converted into Gendarmerie. The police forces of all the territories are under the general supervision of an Inspector General, who has had great experience inPalestine and elsewhere.Under the Italian system there was no Prison Service,- each prison being a self-contained unit with a Fascist in arbitrary personal control. Now, the prisons in each territory are under the Commissioner of Police and have been thoroughly re-organized.Some were in a shocking condition. Prison industries have been started for the manu-facture of clothing, boots, furniture, mats, etc., for the use of the Forces, for theAdministration, and for sale.(c) Finance. As to finance, the conquering British Armies took into the Italianterritories the currencies of the countries from which their operations started, viz.,Egyptian currency from the North, and East African shillings from the South, and the ethiopian patriots had their favourite Maria Theresa dollars. These currencies were immediately made legal tender in the occupied territories. Since then East Africancurrency has been introduced generally into the whole of Italian East Africa and egyptian currency has been withdrawn. The lira continues to circulate but to adecreasing extent. It is not accepted generally by the Administration, but Italian coinand small denomination notes are recognized as small change at 480 Hre^^l.The rupee has been restored in British Somaliland. Notes &quot; Issued by the british military authority &quot; are being used in Tripolitania.Italian banks have had either to be closed or their activities much restricted.Barclays Bank have opened branches at the principal centres.Taxes continue to be collected in accordance with the Italian system, but adjust-ments have been made as necessary to take account of the depreciation of the lire. the sums raised were sufficient to meet only a small part of the expenditure, owing to thedifficulties of collection and the poorness of the Colonies: they have always been heavily subsided from Metropolitan Italy. The net cost of the administration of the territoriesoccupied in East Africa including British Somaliland, was, in the first complete year,some , 2,000,000.In Eritrea, as an anti-inflation measure, a contribution over and above the existingtaxes is about to be levied in the form of increased income tax.
(d) British Somaliiand is again a special case. By an Order in Council the military governor is invested with all the powers and prerogatives of the peace-time Governor andthe administration is unaltered save that the officers are uniformed. Reports received in theWar Office are forwarded regularly to the Colonial Office, whose advice is sought in all matters of any consequence. The fact that the whole area, bounded in the West by Ethiopiaand Kenya and in the East by the sea, is, with the exception of French Somaliland, underthe same general military control, has to a very great extent removed the sources of ancienttroubles, frontier disputes and grazing quarrels. This tranquillity means in practice a most useful saving in military force.(e) Ethiopian Railway. This, and a &quot;reserved&quot; area on the borders of british somali land, are under British military control by virtue of the provisions of the agreement made with the Emperor of Ethiopia. All other camps and cantonments temporarily&quot; reserved &quot; in Ethiopia have been returned to the Emperor&apos;s jurisdiction.(/) Repatriation. Some mention should be made of the repatriation of 18,000 women and children to Italy, most of whom were in Ethiopia. This has been done on Italian linersand largely at the cost of the Italian Government. A third voyage to remove a number ofwomen and children from Eritrea and Italian Somaliland to a total of another 8,000 personsis in view.About 14,000 Italians of military age have been evacuated to the East AfricanDependencies and to Southern Rhodesia. With the exception of some 1,000 Italiantechnicians whom the Emperor wishes to retain because they are necessary for themaintenance of his public utilities, all Italians have been removed from Ethiopia.III. Cyrenaica and Tripolitania.These territories provide an example of the close co-operation which exists between my Department and the Foreign Office, for the policy which is being pursued is affectedby political considerations of great importance. The two territories will be subjected to slightly different political treatment. Cyrenaica is placed on a different footing fromTripolitania by reason of a declaration made in Parliament by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs on 8th january/, 1942, in the following words:  &quot; The Said Idris el Senussi made contact with the British authorities in Egyptwithin a month of the collapse of France, at the time when the military situation in africa was most unfavourable to us. A British Senussi force was subsequentlyraised from those of his followers who had escaped from Italian oppression at various times during the past twenty years. This force performed considerableancillary duties during the successful fighting in the Western Desert in the winter of1940-41, and is again playing a useful part in the campaign now in progress. I take this opportunity of expressing the warm appreciation of H.M. Government for the contribution which Said Idris el Senussi and his followers have made and aremaking to the British war effort. We welcome their association with His Majesty&apos;forces in the task of defeating the common enemies. H.M. Government are determined that at the end of the war the Senussi in Cyrenaica will in no circum-stances again fall under Italian domination.&quot;On certain proposals made by the Chief Political Officer, Middle East, to theMinister of State, it became desirable for the implications of this declaration to be clarified, and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs wrote to Mr. Casey on 25th June,1942.   The following are the relevant extracts from that fetter:  Though no explicit statement to that effect has been made or will be madefor the present, it is in fact the intention of H.M.G. that Cyrenaica shail in no circumstances again fall under Italian domination, and the position as regardsthe populations of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica is clearly understood by them . . .The Axis occupants in, for example Yugoslavia and the Japanese in territoriesseized by them are proceeding on the basis that there will be a permanent changein the political status of the countries concerned, while our own line is that theyhave no right to do so. In the case of Cyrenaica, therefore, we should when thetime comes act as we think right but refrain from any statement of our inten-tions . . . Italian sovereignty over Cyrenaica will in law continue until terminatedeither by annexation (which would not bind Italy) or by the peace settlement.&quot;When Cyrenaica was re-occupied it became necessary to give some guidance to theCommander-in-Chief in the light of the declaration made in Parliament and the com-uientary on it referred to above. This guidance was given in War Office telegram 92861Qf the 9th January, 1943, reproduced at Appendix A. The only political assumptionmade in that telegram is (in accordance with the declaration) that Cyrenaica shall notaSain come under Italian domination, and the principles upon which the military administration of the province is to be based are those which normally guide us in all
occupied territories, namely, Chapter XIV of the Manual of Military Law. Accordinglyanything approaching a recognition of temporal power in the hands of Said Idris eiSenussi is inadmissible, but the interests and advantage of the local native inhabitantswill be constantly borne in mind by the military administrator. He will temper or repealexisting laws and regulations which are partial to Italian interests at the expense of native interests; he will endeavour to improve the present conditions of natives, andhe will exclude undesirable immigrants while encouraging normal trade.Tripolitania is not on all fours with Cyrenaica, for there the Senussi element representsonly a small minority, and the declaration made in Parliament does not apply. We proposetherefore, that in Tripolitania the normal principles of military government and the require-ments of international conventions shall be observed without any specific qualification as in cyrenaica.An important fact in the case is that whereas the effect of military operations has beenthe withdrawal of all Italians from Cyrenaica (there are only about 100 left, and those arepriests and nuns), there are many thousands of Italian colonists in Tripolitania, and it maybe expected that one of the major problems to be faced will be the return of these coloniststo their farms in Tripolitania.   The Italians will not return to Cyrenaica.Thus in both these territories we propose to act on the assumption that no policy hasbeen formulated by H.M. Government regarding their post-war status, although with regardto Cyrenaica we are committed to the non-return of this predominately Senussi country toItaly. We shall, therefore, proceed to administer the area as occupied enemy territoryaccording to the appropriate provisions of the Manual of Military Law. Military Adminis-administrators and Political Officers have been warned to eschew all discussion about the politicalfuture of these North African territories and to abstain from any declaration on the subject.As to the machinery of government, that is the same as is applied in our other occupied territories.P. J.G.The War Office,24/// February, 1943.APPENDIX &quot; A &quot;From : The War Office.   To : Mideast for Political. Desp. 0600, 10 Jan. 43.MOST SECRET92S61   Cipher (M.O. n) dated 9 Jan.Your OET/83679 Dec. 13.One. While H.M.G. are anxious that you should endeavour to improve presentconditions of local inhabitants they are not prepared now to go beyond declarations already made as to future Cyrenaica, contained in statement made by Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in Parliament on 8 Jan 1942. Further Cyrenaica being legally enemy territory itmust during period war be governed in accordance M.M.L.Two.  It follows that enemy property whether urban houses country farms or otherwill be vested in C.E.P., but his concern for absent enemies interests will not preventproperty being utilised to advantage of local inhabitants. In so doing declaration ofH.M.G. quote Senussi in Cyrenaica will in no circumstances again fall under Italiandomination unquote will be borne in mind but read in light of Eden to Casey of 25 June1942 quote refrain from any statement of our intentions unquote. Your suggestion lettingurban houses falls within above and may be applied at discretion.Three. You will doubtless at your discretion temper existing criminal and civil laws and regulations which are partial to Italian interests at expense of A.rab interests.Four.  Principle of exclusion undesirables including immigrants and traders is accepted and application left to your discretion.Five. Presume your intention quote to maintain Cyrenaica purely Arab State likeTransjordan unquote does not (repeat not) imply some form indirect rule through Said Idrisnor any recognition his temporal powers since that would violate general principle in para,one above. You should be careful not (repeat not) to make any statement about future policy and should enjoin similar discretion on your subordinates.Six. As regards Tripolitania you will proceed in normal way being guided as toprinciple by M.M.L.Seven. Above agreed with Foreign Office.C.6 Telegrams.
