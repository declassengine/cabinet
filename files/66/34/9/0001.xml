(43) 59.February 10, 1943.WAR CABINET.REACTIONS IN THE UNITED  STATES  TO  THE  beveridge report.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN view of the forthcoming debate on the Beveridge Report, I think that mycolleagues may be interested to read the annexed despatch and memorandum fromHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington on American reactions to the Report.A. E.Foreign Office, February 10, 1943.Annex.Viscount Halifax to Mr. Eden.(No. 32.)Sir, Was/ungton, January 19, 1943.I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a memorandumentitled &quot; American Reactions to the Beveridge Report,&quot; prepared byProfessor Allardyce Nicol of the Office of Reports in His Majesty&apos;s Embassy.2. I have no general comments to make on Mr. Nicol&apos;s memorandum, whichI consider sums up the comment to date very adequately. There is no doubt thatthe Report has on the whole been one of the most effective pieces of british propaganda for United States consumption for some time : the best evidence forthis being that the Report has become as it were part of the American language,any similar publication by any American organisation being known as that organisation^ &quot; Bevericlge Report.&quot;3. The National Resources Planning Board have promised to communicate to a member of my staff a copy of the comparison of their own similar plan withthe Beveridge Report, but the promised copy has not yet been received. If itappears to be of interest I shall not fail to forward it to you.4. I should be grateful if a copy of this, despatch could be passed to theMinistry of Information.I have. &amp;c.HALIFAX.American Reactions to the Beveridge Report.1. The entrance of the Beveridge Report on to the American scene was nicelytimed. The very great volume of comment accorded to it depended, of course,mainly on the inherent interest of the Report itself, but in other circumstancesthis interest might have passed with much less notice. In particular, the report was read intently by Americans for the light it might shed (a) on the nature andprevailing ideas of present-day Britain and (b) on the domestic social problemsof the United States.11967   [25028]Copw No.
(a) Opinion regarding Britain lias been tending lately to take its colouringfrom criticism of &quot; Imperialism,&quot; with special reference to India. The resultof this is that a considerable proportion of the public had become convinced that either (i) the Government in London was dominated by an obscurantist and selfishminority, or (ii) the British people as a whole (except for a small group which alone shared American democratic principles) was essentially &quot; undemocratic.&quot;As a consequence, the provisions of the Report came as a certain shock andattracted an attention that otherwise might have been lacking.(b) During the past two months the subject of war aims and of post-warplanning has become an immediate issue, highlighted by the struggle between theNew Dealers and the Conservatives. Contributing towards this have been (i) the belief that the war&apos;s end may come reasonably soon, (ii) the increased strengthand consequent activity of the Republicans, (iii) the desire to formulate policies for the 1944 elections, (iv) the growing impact of the war on the lives of individuals with inevitable thoughts concerning the future, (v) the constantemphasis by Republicans (such as Willkie and Hoover) and Democrats (such asWallace and Welles), supported by influential commentators like Lippmann,Lindley, Gram Swing, Dorothy Thompson and Clapper, for immediate discussionof post-war plans. Since the extension of social services has been one of themain characteristics of the New Deal Administration, naturally the Report hasbeen read with vivid interest not simply as a &quot;foreign&quot; document but assomething having implications for America as well.2. The first general reaction to the Report was one of admiration. &quot; Notthe least wonder.&quot; typically remarked a Southern journal, &quot; will be at the ever-lasting stamina of the British people, probably the only nation in the worldwhich would even form such a plan while engaged in a war for survival.&quot; Hereinis a prime example demonstrating that a single positive act is worth far more to us in publicity value than a ceaseless stream of refutations of libels against us or of sober explanations of our past and present.3. The second general result has been a reassessment of the Britishthemselves. At first, basing their ideas on assumptions concerning the reactionarycharacter of present-day Britain several commentators tried to suggest (1) thatthe Report would not receive a widespread welcome in Britain, and/or (2) thatthe Tories would crush it in Parliament. It has now, however, been demonstrated(i) that 70 per cent, of the British people are in its favour, (ii) that even theConservative London Times has laid on it the seal of approval, (iii) that theReport was called for by the Government itself, and (iv) that the Prime Minister,supposed to be (however heroic) a reactionary because of his statements on India,has been for long, associated with Beveridge. The consequence is a quite clearly-indicated revaluation of the British.4. Naturally, the Report is not looked upon with the same eye by Liberalsand by Conservatives. It is true (i) that the great body of comment (except incertain mid-Western areas is openly or restrainedly favourable, (ii) that thereis a general recognition of the fact that basically the Report is bound to havea bearing on the American domestic scene, and (iii) that its fate in parliament will have a definite influence here; but apart from this attitudes differ.So far as the conservatively inclined are concerned the following reactionsare noticeable : (a) Since there was a certain amount of advance publicity with a high-lighted statement attributed to Beveridge that his scheme went&quot; half way to Moscow,&quot; the appearance of the Report itself wasgreeted almost with a sigh of relief, and nearly all commentatorspointed out that it was &quot; evolutionary &quot; rather than &quot; revolutionary.&quot;In order to prove this, many newspapers were at pains to describe the already existing British social services with obviously goodpublicity effect.(b) Underlying several of the comments was a feeling of surprise thatpractical and realistic Britain had commissioned a report from justsuch a representative of the &quot; long-haired, starry-eyed &quot; enthusiastsas were being currently attacked in Washington. One has theimpression that this has given at least slight pause to those whosechief amusement lately has been ridicule of the New Idealists. here is present a feeling that, if hard-headed Britain can take up. time witha JBeveridge Report, perhaps the idealistic schemes have something in them after all.
(c) To this is added another- effect which may be described in the words of the christian Science Monitor: &quot; Congressmen have privately debated whether social security should be undertaken during war time, but the action ofthe British Government in publicising the far-reaching beveridge report seems to be having its effect.&quot;(d) Naturally, the sweeping reforms suggested in the Report could not provepleasant to the ears of the business reactionaries. There men wereobviously in a quandary. With one or two exceptions, they realised that the humanitarian appeal of the scheme was such as to make openopposition to it a dangerous procedure, and hence almost all wereprepared to greet its appearance with a show of favour. At the sametime, they felt bound to make flanking attacks. Initially, they tried to suggest (i) that, since it was sure to be defeated in Parliament, itwas not of much importance; and (ii) that it was &quot;devised withpurpose to keep some element of the English population in line for the duration of the war.&quot;Such arguments, however, were soon seen to be forced, and hence others havebeen brought forward.   It was said (i) that Americans need no. such &quot; promise of governmental reward &quot;to stimulate their war effort;(ii) that Americans do not want State paternalism;(iii) that the scheme is merely a suggested cure and does not get down to theroots of social want;(iv) that free business enterprise, if allowed a free hand, could create a post-war world where a scheme of this kind would be unnecessary;(v) that Britain&apos;s economy in the future could not bear the burden of the beveridge scheme;(vi) that, if it did, it could only be by further &quot; exploitation &quot; of thecolonies or dependence on continued Lend-Lease aid.5. Such objections, however, are markedly less than the weight of favourablecomment, and there is no doubt that even in Conservative circles failure to implement the Report would react adversely on Britain. A much more seriousadverse reaction would certainly come from the Liberal section of the public, whichhas unanimously endorsed the terms of the Beveridge scheme : (a) Most interesting result of the Report has been a marked wave of enviousjealousy on the part both of Liberals and others. &quot; Perhaps we had better hurry,&quot; comments a North-western paper, &quot; Great Britain hasthought up a system so far advanced in social thinking as to make uscatch our breath.&quot; The Luce publications show obvious annoyancethat Britain should have to credit of this plan; The Nation. NeivRepublic and Newsweek share similar sentiments.(6) By far the most interesting development from this jealousy is the emphasis given to what is now being openly called &quot; The AmericanBeveridge Report &apos;&apos; ci scheme for social service presented to thePresident by the National Resources Planning Board. Although the contents of this scheme have not been made public, various com-mentators have hinted that, when divulged, it will prove bigger and better than Beveridge.(c) At the same time, various papers have striven to show (i) that while the beveridge plans do in some respects go beyond American social service the existing American provisions are reasonably extensive and (ii) thatthe Beveridge scheme owes much to the social service legislationestablished in the United States since 1933.(d) Among the Liberals more than among the Conservatives is an awarenessof the propaganda value of the Report. R. L. Strout. writing in the christian Science Monitor, reflects a common view when he declares that the Report.&apos;&apos; is symptomatic of something very basic that is going on, the search for a better post-war world that will justify to thecommon man all the sacrifices and hardships he is now making.&quot; the nazi anger and concern over its appearance have been duly noted andthere is recognition that here is excellent propaganda not only forGreat Britain but also for the United Nations.   We understand that
already O.W.I. has been using it in overseas broadcasts, restrainingthemselves from still more extensive use only because to quote oneO.W.I. representative, they are afraid of being &quot; left out on a limb &quot;if it is rejected in Parliament.6. From the above summary of American reactions it is apparent (i) that parliamentary discussions of the Report will be strongly lime-lighted and (ii) thatrejection of the Report, or anything which could reasonably be construed as that,would have an extremely adverse effect. So far as can be judged, the onlytroublesome question likely to arise is : &quot; Will any of the cost of the scheme fallon the United States? &quot; There are indications that a section of the public is beginning to become more than a trifle suspicious regarding possible commitments in Europe (for example, in connection with post-war feeding).Apart from this, however, although no doubt rejection of the Report wouldrelieve certain industrialist and Wall Street circles and. possibly please someof the &quot; We-told-you-so &quot; exponents of &quot; American Century&quot; views, there seemsno doubt that for the general public this would strengthen the view that theBritish are reactionary and even hypocritical since, they would say, thereobviously had never been any real intention of giving reality to the provisions ofthe Report. At the moment, officials of O.W.I., on the basis of national surveys,assure us that, since the Battle of Britain, we have never had a better piece of propaganda, but they also warn us that the public will be watching closely tosee whether words are translated into action. In the meantime, the Report ishaving an undoubted effect in influencing the American domestic political sceneand in modifying traditional attitudes towards the British people.
