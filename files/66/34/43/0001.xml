After a thorough enquiry, I have satisfied myself that no alternative means can be found of meeting the essential needs of the Army with less damage to agricultural production. I have accordingly decided that the area in question should be taken over by the War Office as a training area for armoured forma-tions.   The necessary measures are being taken to this end.J.
