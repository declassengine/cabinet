NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   A convoy has readied Malta from Alexandria.Our submarines have inflicted casualties on enemy shipping in theMediterranean.One U-boat has been sunk, three have probably been sunk and several others have been damaged.One convoy has suffered serious casualties and two others, all outward bound,have been attacked in the North Atlantic. In consequence, shipping losses havebeen heavier.Home Waters.2. HALS. Sheffield, on passage to Iceland (C), sustained considerable damage owing to very rough weather on the 19th.Northern Waters.3.   Russian warships sank an 8,000-ton transport in the Barents Sea.During an air raid on Murmansk on the 19th, superficial damage wassustained by one U.S. and three British ships. Some damage was also caused tosheds and cargo ashore.Mediterranean.4. A convoy of four ships and two tankers arrived at Malta from alexandria on the 22nd.5. H.M.C.S. Weyburn (corvette), escorting a homeward bound convoy from north Africa, was mined and sunk on the 22nd m the Strait of Gibraltar.HALS. Wivern (destroyer), who was standing by, was damaged by the explosion of Weyburn&quot;&apos;s depth charges.6.   The following attacks have been reported by H.M. Submarines :  On the 14th, Trooper possibly torpedoed a large ship off Corfu. Saracen(P. 247), in the Gulf of Genoa, sank two tugs on the 12th, possibly torpedoed alarge eastbound tanker on the 15th, and shelled a schooner building-yard at Cervo,damaging two schooners, on the 19th. On the 1.8th. off the north coast of Sicily.Sahib (P. 212) shelled two schooners, which were left derelict.Unruffled (P. 46) torpedoed and probably sank a medium-size ship off theeast coast of Tunisia on the 21st. Unrivalled (P. 45) sank a 1,000-ton sailing ship off southern Italy on the 16th, and on the same day torpedoed a 6,000-ton shipescorted by two destroyers. Splendid (P. 228), while on patrol off the north coast of Sicily, sank three ships, details of which are not yet available.7. Naval aircraft successfully attacked shipping in the Sicilian Channel,details of which are given in the :&apos; Air Situation.&apos;&apos;U.S. aircraft, during attacks on shipping, damaged an enemy cruiser andprobably sank two small escort vessels.Pacific.8. U.S. Submarine Argonaut was sunk whilst attacking a Japaneseconvoy, which was later attacked by other U.S. submarines and two ships were sunk. The Argonaut before sinking is reported, to have torpedoed a Japanesedestroyer.In addition, one tanker, one medium-sized transport, two cargo ships andone escort vessel have been sunk, and a Japanese cruiser has been torpedoed andprobably sunk, by US. submarines.A Japanese cruiser or large destroyer was damaged at Rabaul by Alliedbombers on the 23rd.Although the Japanese have been reinforcing their troops in Northern new guinea, this has not affected the concentration of shipping at Rabaul, which onthe 22nd amounted to 61 shipsAnti-Submarine Operations.9. Thirty attacks, four by aircraft and. 26 by surface craft, have beencarried out during the week. One Italian and two German U-boats have probably been sunk, four U-boats probably damaged, and one possibly damaged
On the 17th the escorts of an outward bound convoy damaged a U-boat inthe North-West Approaches. On the 19th an Italian U-boat was probably sunk off Benghazi by ELM. destroyers and trawlers in co-operation with aircraft. Onthe same day H.M.S. Columbine (corvette), escorting a convoy to North Africa,carried out a promising attack north-west of Cape Ortegal. A U-boat waspossibly damaged by aircraft in the Bay of Biscay on the same clay. On the 20th,a U.S. aircraft probably damaged a U-boat in the South-West Approaches andon the 21st a U-boat was probably damaged by a Libertor (B.24) in raid-At!antic.On the following day, H.M.S. Dianthus (corvette), escorting an outward bound convoy probably sank a U-boat, and the U.S. Campbell (cutter), escorting thesame convoy, rammed and probably sank a U-boat in mid-Atlantic.On the 13th, Russian aircraft sank a U-boat off Tuapse in the Black Sea.Enemy Intelligence.German.10. Extensive photographic reconnaissances have been undertaken in thepast week of the German Baltic and North Sea ports. At Kiel on the 20th, GrafZeppelin was seen in the floating dock and Koln alongside. At Bremen on thesame clay all the superstructure of the incompleted cruiser Seidlitz was seen tohave been removed since the 23rd December. At Wilhelmshaven Scheer, whichis believed to be undergoing a refit, was seen in dry dock and Hipper alongside.Photographic reconnaissance of Gdynia on the 21st showed Scharnho?&apos;st,Prinz Eugen, Emden and the twro old battleships Schleisien and Schlesivig-Holstein alongside. The GneisenUu was also seen partially dismantled. the photographs of the building yards suggest that the rate of U-boat building has remained fairly constant since June.Italian.11. There is a slight increase in the traffic to Tunisia as compared withlast week.\]-boats.12. A concentration of U-boats has been operating in mid-Atlantic to theeast of Newfoundland, out of range of Allied air cover from the UK. andIceland (C). and at extreme range from Newfoundland. There have beenindications of a force of U-boats across the northerly Atlantic route. There hasalso been activity south of the Azores.Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ending the 21st/22nd 774 ships have been convoyed.Of these, 152 were in ocean convoys and 622 in British coastal convoys.Fifty-seven destroyers (including 12 U.S. destroyers) and 74 sloops, cuttersand corvettes (including two U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties.During the week 95 ships in two ocean convoys arrived in Home waters without loss.14. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 20th totalled 431,000 tons compared with 311,000 tons during theprevious seven clays and an average of 456,700 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s imports, 163,000 tons were mineral oils of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.15. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked 22 ships,including seven tankers, of which 12 ships, including four tankers, are believed tohave been sunk.In repeated attacks by a concentration of LT-boats on an outward boundAtlantic convoy 12 ships were, torpedoed, and of these six are believed to have sunk. Two ships were torpedoed, one of which was sunk, in another outward bound convoy. A tanker was sunk and two other ships torpedoed in an outward bound convoy south-west of Madeira. One ship was sunk and another torpedoedoff the N. African coast. Two British ships were sunk off the Azores and theEast coast of Africa respectively.   A Brazilian ship was sunk off Baia.One ship was damaged in an air attack on Algiers harbour.
British Minelaying.16. During the week surface craft laid mines in the East Coast Barrage andoff the Dutch coast. Aircraft minelaying has been carried out off the GermanNorth Sea. coast and in the Mediterranean off Greece.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.17. During the week mines were probably laid by enemy aircraft offHarwich and between Dover and Dungeness. On the 18th E-boats were probablymine-laying in the North Sea midway between Yarmouth and the Dutch coastIt is possible that a U-boat was mine-laying in the convoy route off the Welshcoast early on the 18th.Two mines have been destroyed in the western approaches to Gibraltar.German and French mines have been washed ashore on the east coast of africa and in the Seychelles.The mine totals are 4,173 ground and 2,200 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.18. The transfer of Vichy shipping to Italian ports progressed steadilythroughout January. Photographic reconnaissance of Marseilles and neigh-bouring ports on the 26th January revealed that 54 ships of over 200 feet&apos; in length had left since the 29th December. In all, some 110 .Vichy or Vichy-controlled merchant ships had been transferred to Italian ports by the end ofJanuary. A number have been identified as carrying military cargoes to north africa and no doubt others are being held in reserve for the maintenance ofthis traffic.Of the 300 merchant ships of all types totalling some 900,000 tons winch,were known to be in French ports in the Mediterranean on the German occupa-tion, it is reported that only about 50,000 tons will remain under Vichy control,and these ships will trade with Corsica. With the exception of ships requiredby the Germans for their trade with Spain, all other serviceable ships are being sent to Italian ports where they will be divided between the Germans and Italians.There has been no evidence to suggest the early movement of any of thisshipping to the Black Sea.19. The German s.s. N or d fete (1,214 tons), which had been in Bilbao after beingtorpedoed by the U.S. submarine Shad, reloaded iron ore and sailed for France on the 19th.The Italian tanker Albaro (2,104) left Istanbul and entered the xEgean onthe 18th. The Italian tanker Celeno (3,741 tons) arrived at Istanbul on the19th en route for the Black Sea.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)The Russo-German Campaign.Northern Sector.20. The Russians have resumed offensive operations in the area south-east of Schlusselburg; nothing is known of their scale or progress. South-east of lake Ilmen the Germans claim to have repulsed Russian attacks. There is no confirmation of this from Other sources, and it is possible that purely localoperations have been deliberately exaggerated by the Germans in order to be ableto lay claim to a success on the Eastern front.Orel-Kursk Sector.21. The Russians have maintained their pressure both north and south ofKursk. They have made progress in the north, where they have created a salienteast of Orel.   South of Kursk the Russians have captured Oboyan.Kharkov Sector.22. To the north-west and west of Kharkov the Russians have extended theirgains, and, thrusting astride the line Kharkov-Sumy, have reported the capture of Sumy, Lebedin and Akhtyrka.
To the south-west of Kharkov the Russians are driving towardsDnyepropetrovsk, astride the railway through Krasnograd, which they have captured, and astride the line Losovaya-Pavlograd, which latter town they havealso taken. The spearheads of these two thrusts are now within some 30 miles ofDnyepropetrovsk, but are encountering stubborn counter-attacks.Donetz Bend Sector.23. The German withdrawal from the salient formed by the Donetz bend hascontinued. In the area south of the Middle Donetz the Russians have capturedSlavyansk. A Russian Mobile force is still operating in the Krasnoarmeisk area,but the Germans have fought hard to prevent any further Russian penetration of the northern flank of the Donetz salient.Taman Bridgehead.24. The Russians are maintaining their pressure against the Germanbridgehead in the Taman Peninsula and have made progress both on the northernflank of the bridgehead position and north-east of Novorossisk. The Germans,who had withdrawn to strongly prepared positions, are defending stubornlyand counter-attacking, but evacuation is proceeding by sea and air.Summary.25. In the earlier part of the week there was a thaw which extended as farnorth as Moscow, and has probably slowed down Russian progress to someextent in the areas affected. There is still no evidence to suggest where theGermans may hope to stabilise the battle, but in the Donetz salient, assistedpossibly by the weather and in part by powerful counter-attacks, in whichdivisions recently arrived from France may have been involved, the germans have for the moment achieved some degree of stabilisation.Tunisia.First A rmy.26. On the 17th the enemy obtained possession of Sbeitla, Kasserine andThelepte airfield at Feriana, bringing to a halt temporarily their advance west-wards that had begun on the 14th from Faid.Sbeitla was only evacuated on the evening of the 17th after the attackingGerman forces had been sufficiently kept in check to permit of the withdrawalof U.S. armoured: forces through the town to their new assembly area south-east of Tebessa. Nothing of value to the enemy was left on Thelepte airfield, all aircraft and stores being either removed or destroyed.Sporadic attacks by the enemy in the area of Pichon and Sbiba were allrepulsed without difficulty, but on the evening of the 20th enemy motorisedinfantry occupied the Kasserine gap to the north-west of the town. After a few hours&apos; halt the advance was continued north towards Thala and north-westtowards Djebel El Hambra and the pass immediately to the north of that hill.The northern and main thrust was supported by some 40 tanks and medium artillery that had been brought up through the Kasserine Pass, and it was onlyhalted shortly before midday on the 21st when it encountered considerable Britisharmoured forces. Four enemy tanks were destroyed. The subsidiary thrusts tothe north-west had by 0300 hours on the 21st reached the initial slopes of DjebelEl Hambra, where U.S. armoured forces checked it and later forced the enemy to withdraw after losing six tanks. Fighting on a heavy scale continued north .of Kasserine and in the area of Djebel El Hambra. The enemy&apos;s thrusts were,however, halted at every point, casualties inflicted on him and prisoners taken.By the 23rd the enemy had been forced to withdraw to the Kasserine Gap.On the 21st the enemy launched an additional but subsidiary attack,supported by 14 tanks, at a point some five miles south of Sbiba, and were onlyrepulsed after the appearance of Churchill tanks in a counter-attack; the first time that these tanks have been in action on this front. Nine Churchill tanks were engaged and one was destroyed as against the disablement of four enemytanks.In the northern sector there has been persistent skirmishing in the areaseast of Medjez El Bab and to the north-west of Jefna.In Southern Tunisia the enemy are stated to have captured Nefta, some60 miles south-west of Gafsa.
Eighth A rmy.27. Our troops occupied Foum Tatahouine on the 18th. Fighting on the outskirts of Medenine continued until the 20th, when the enemy rearguard wasdriven out of the town. By the 22nd British patrols had moved astride the main road to within ten miles of Mareth. Enemy positions were located on the high ground to the west of the road, and spasmodic shelling and mines were encounteredby our patrols.28. The Eighth Army came under the command of General Alexander in tunisia on the 20th. General Wilson succeeded General Alexander as commander-in-Chief, Middle East, on the 16th.Burma.A arakan.29. An attack launched by our troops on the 18th against Japanese positionsnorth of Donbaik on the Mayu Peninsula achieved only partial success. a counter-attack made by the Japanese the following clay enabled them, to regainsome of the ground lost and the situation remains substantially unchanged.Far East.China.30. On the 12th the Japanese began small-scale operations in Central andSouth China. It is probable that these operations are designed to discourage any possible increase in the activity of Chinese guerillas, who may be emboldened bythe recent withdrawals of Japanese troops from these areas.On the 21st, Japanese forces occupied Kwangchowwan (Fort Bayard) on thesouth coast opposite the island of Hainan. So far as is known the Vichy Frenchoffered no resistance to this latest Japanese depredation, which passed without incident.Intelligence.France.31. Four more divisions (S.S. Totenkopf and 319, 327 and 333 Infantry-Divisions) have left France, reducing the number of German divisions in Franceand the Low Countries to 30.S.S. Totenkopf and 327 and 333 Infantry Divisions have now been indentified in Russia, and it is thought that 319 Division may at present be in Germanyen route for Russia.AIR SITUATION.General Review.32. Bomber Command aircraft made three heavy night attacks onWilhelmshaven and one on Bremen.Unfavourable weather restricted, operations in North Africa.Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in the Mediterranean andin the South-West Pacific.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.33. Seventeen Mosquitoes of Bomber Command bombed the railway centre at Tours and 12 escorted Venturas (B.34) of the same Command bombed the dock&apos;area at Den Helder. Photographs taken dining the attacks show that theMosquitoes dropped, the majority of their bombs on and around the railway workshops and that the Venturas (B.34) scored, several hits on the torpedo work-shops,   (See Appendix VI.)   One Mosquito is missing.Aircraft of Fighter and. Army Co-operation Commands attacked com-munications, power stations and other targets in Northern France, Belgium andGermany.   Two power stations and several locomotives were damaged.Night.34. Wilhelmshaven was heavily raided on three nights. Of the 648 aircraft dispatched by Bomber Command, 588 attacked the target, dropping 718 tons
7147of H.E. and. 796 tons of incendiaries. On the first night, visibility was excellentwith bright moonlight. The marker bombs were well placed by the Pathfinderforce with the result that the main force accurately bombed the town and docks,where large fires were started. On the second night, the weather was clear as faras the enemy coast, then cloud developed. The early arrivals of the Pathfinderforce were able to identify the Bauhafen and dropped their marker bombsthrough gaps in the cloud. The main force found that ground detail wasobscured but they concentrated their bombing on the markers, which wereaccurately placed and seen through the clouds. On the third night a blind-bombing attack was made in thick cloud : the sky-markers were scattered at firstbut achieved a greater concentration later in the attack. From these threeoperations 15 aircraft are missing and three crashed. Three enemy aircraft were destroyed, in combat.A blind bombing attack was also made on Bremen by 129 aircraft, which dropped 435 tons of H.E. and incendiary bombs. Marker-bombs and flares were well concentrated; the main force bombed on these and completed their attack in20 minutes.A total of six Mosquitoes carried out blind-bombing attacks on targets in the ruhr.Fifteen aircraft of Army Co-operation Command bombed three electricitytransformer stations on the Loire and Seine. Two stations were hit, but results,could not be seen at the third owing to thick haze.   Three aircraft are missing.Nine bombers, one of which is missing, dropped leaflets on Paris, Orleans andChartres.&quot; Intruder &quot; operations over Northern France, Belgium and North-west germany were carried out by 23 aircraft of Fighter Command.. Four railwaytrains were damaged and several locomotives were destroyed or damaged.Coastal Operations.35. Six aircraft of Coastal Command attacked two convoys off the dutch coast. A ship of about 4,000 tons was torpedoed and two others of 2,000 and 2,500tons were hit with bombs.Shipping off the SW. coast of Norway was bombed by three Hampdens, butresults were not observed.Three Beaufighters of Fighter Command, aided by flares dropped by NavalAlbacores, attacked and damaged three E-boats east of Lowestoft.Ninety-two aircraft of Bomber Command laid 222 sea mines in enemy waters;three aircraft are missing.United Kingdom.36. Due to unfavourable weather, enemy activity was on a very small scale.In daylight six fighter-bombers and three reconnaissance aircraft crossed ourcoasts, and at night only four aircraft were reported overland.Mediterranean.French North A frica North and Central Sectors.37.   Weather conditions were unfavourable throughout the week.On the 18th, 179 U.S. fighter sorties were flown in the Sbeita-Ferianaarea where attacks were made on M.T. and troop concentrations, and on the2lst U.S. Michells (B.25) bombed and obtained many hits on Gafsa railway centre, but it was only on the 23rd that large-scale operations were possible and even then results could not be fully observed; on that day a total of 566bomber and fighter sorties were flown, and the weight of the attack was con-centrated in the vicinity of the Kasserine Pass.Forty-six U.S. Fortresses (B.17) dropped 3,000 fragmentation bombs on thetown of Kasserine while U.S. Mitchells (B.25) Marauders (B.26) and Fortresses(B.17) dropped a larger number in the area of the Pass; 24 other U.S. Fortresses(B.17) bombed Kairouan airfield. During these and similar offensive opera-tions nine enemy aircraft were destroyed and 18 Allied aircraft are missing.On the 24th, a squadron of U.S. Marauders (B.26) escorted by Spitfiresattacked the airfield at El Aouina, and obtained hits on dispersed aircraft;enemy fighters intercepted, eight of which were shot down and three U.S.bombers were lost. Allied light bombers attacked Sbeitla and M.T. and com-munications in the Kasserine-Feriana-Gaf sa area.
An attack was made from 200 feet on 13 barges by six U.S. Mitchells (B.25),resulting in the destruction of five barges which were carrying trucks and&apos;several others being damaged; three of these bombers were shot down by A.A. lire.On three nights an average of about 20 Bisleys attacked M.T., roads, rail-ways and communication targets between Gafsa, Kasserine and Fondouk;Wellingtons also carried out a successful raid on Bizerta. Three bombers acemissing.Enemy offensive operations were not on a large scale; on one nightBeaufmEters shot down two Cant.Z. 1007s off Bone.Southern Sector.38. Unfavourable weather restricted operations over the forward area toa small scale. On the night of 23rd/24th Allied bombers attacked enemy positions between Wacli Zigzan and the Arran-Mareth Road, causing a numberof fires. The town and airfield at Gabes were also bombed by a combined force ofabout 30 Wellingtons and Halifaxes. On the following clay Kittyhawks (P. 40)attacked the landing-ground at Bordj Tonal and bombed targets in the Gabes-Mareth area.On the 20th enemy dive-bomber and fighter-bomber operations were directed against the Army spearheads pushing north-west from Medenine towards theMareth line.Libya.39. An enemy attack was made at night on Tobruk by 10 aircraft, and threeattacks, the largest by 25 aircraft, were made on Tripoli. No serious damage was caused and Beaufighters and A.A. guns destroyed nine, probably destroyed two and damaged another.Southern Italy and Sicily.40. The harbour at Palermo was bombed by aircraft from Libya on two nights. Owing to more favourable weather the second attack, carried out by21 Wellingtons and six Halifaxes, was the more successful and many fires were reported.An attack by three U.S. Liberators (B. 24) on the docks at Naples resulted intwo ships being hit. Other Liberators (B. 24) successfully bombed the chemical works at Crotone.In daylight a strong force of II.S. heavy bombers attacked Messina and con-siderable damage is believed to have been inflicted; hits were reported on the train-ferry terminus and on railway sidings.   One Ale. 109 was shot down.Intruder aircraft from Malta were active over Sicily and concentrated on railway targets. At least 15 trains were attacked and damaged, some of whichwere set on fire, and eight locomotives were hit; a ship of 800 tons off Marettimowas machine-gunned.   Two of our aircraft are missing.A attacks on Shipping.41.

A total of seven Liberators (B. 24) on two nights bombed the airfields atHeraklion and Kasstelli Pediada. causing some fires in the dispersal areas.
Russia.43. Air operations over1 the whole front appear to have been on a reduced scale owing to very unfavourable weather.In the Caucasus considerable air activity was maintained, and it is probablethat the Soviet Air Force has air superiority over the German Kuban bridgehead,where coastal towns, particularly Novorossisk, were repeatedly attacked.Transport aircraft continued to play a large part in maintaining the german army in this area and in assisting with the evacuation of wounded and unnecessary personnel.In the far North two German attacks were made on Murmansk, and theRussians bombed airfields round Petsamo.The Russians claim to have destroyed during the week ended the20th February 276 Axis aircraft for the loss of 101 of their own.India and Burma.44. Allied aircraft attacked the towns of Akyab and Rathedaung and enemy-occupied villages on Akyab Island. Considerable damage was caused torolling-stock, landing craft and buildings.

A successful raid was made on the railway at Meza where alandslide was caused. The towns of Bhamo, Indaw and Sahmaio were also attacked.Enemy aircraft attacked our forward positions in the Mayu area. Eighteenenemy bombers, escorted by 12 fighters, ineffectively bombed the Dinj an area(N.E.&apos; India). Thirty-two U.S. Kittyhawks (P. 40) intercepted and destroyedsix enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 12 and damaged six.China.45. On the 20th. Nanning (320 miles west of Canton) was again raided by enemy aircraft.Corrigendum. -In paragraph 53 of last weelCs Resume, for &quot;25 U.S.bombers attacked Nanking &quot; read &quot; 57 enemy bombers attacked Nanning.&quot;Pacific Zone.New Guinea.46. In the Lae, Mubo and Waria River areas enemy villages, tracks andpositions were continuously attacked by- Allied aircraft. U.S. heavy bombersraided the airfields at Lae, Madang and Malalang.
