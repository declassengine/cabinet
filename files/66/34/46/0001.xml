Itmay be of interest to my colleagues.NO attempt is made in this paper to suggest what should ultimately be the relationship of any future Germany to her neighbours, or how she should fit into the European and world organisation. No answer is possible to that question until it is clearer what kind of world organisation is going to emerge. Afterthe last war, opinion in influential German circles was divided on the questionwhether the future of Germany lay in association with the East or with the West;in the event it was Stresemann who took the first step towards the Westthrough the Locarno Pact. Given the German worship of strength, the attractionof the East after this war may well be very great. We should not therefore losesight of the possibility that, in order to forestall any orientation of german policy towards the U.S.S.R., and the conclusion of an ultimate Russo-Germanalliance directed against the West, one of our tasks will be to convince theGerman people that their best long-term interest lies in the integration of their national life with that of Europe as a whole and of western Europe in particular.2. We also hope that the time will come when some form of democratically-minded central government will be established in Germany. Either at this stageor, as I should at present prefer, after a further trial period the main occupyingforces will be withdrawn. Indeed, it is only with such a government that a finalTreaty of Peace can be signed. In imposing such discriminatory measures against Germany as will be necessary after the war, it should not be overlookedthat it will ultimately be easier to bring Germany back into the family of nationsif such measures can later, with suitable alterations, be merged into a wider systemof international controls and thereby become non-discriminatory.3. These general considerations should be borne in mind in connexion withthe following preliminary study, which deals only with possible developments inGermany before, during and after a military coilapse.A.

STAGE I.What are likely to be the internal developments in Germany immediatelyprecedent to a request for an armistice?IN 1918 Germany had a Reichstag&apos;, and political opposition parties were ableto express their views. Political change could be brought about by constitutionalmeans and. in fact, the Kaiser did meet popular demand by introducing measures for establishing responsible government. Labour opposition could express itselfby strikes.&apos;2. These conditions do not exist to-day. In Hi tier&apos;s Germany, Hitlercombines the functions of Supreme War Lord and Fiihrer of the German people.Lie is complete and unchallenged dictator in both the military and civilianspheres. There is no ghost of a parliamentary system. Those sections of thepublic which are not in some sense already in power have no way of bringing pressure to bear to produce political changes except by revolution. Police control is extremely strong, and it is probably generally believed that any revolutionary movement would release forces which would plunge Germany into chaos and there-Tore destroy any hope there might be of preserving some bargaining power for germany, i.e., as von Seeckt put it, of keeping her &quot; biindnisfiihig.&quot;3. In view of these circumstances, and because the German people haveaccustomed themselves, as a result of years of effort and regimentation, to live inabnormal conditions of strain, it seems probable that the Home Front will carryon until the military front cracks. The efficiency of the popular effort willdiminish, but the very weariness and despondency that cause this will preventthe outbreak of a revolution, for which some measure of vitality is required. Itis important to distinguish between a decline of effort of this kind, combined withdislocation on the Home Front, which may react on the Armed Forces and hastentheir collapse, and a revolution which would end the war by producing politicalchanges in the regime.4. Of the groups which now share real power in Germany, the two mostimportant are the National Socialist Party and the generals. Rather less important, but by no means negligible, are the capitalists. A fourth group whichmust be considered is that of the religious leaders, especially the leaders of the roman Catholic Church.5. There might be a split in the National Socialist Party. But llitletsprestige stands so high with the Party and with the German people that no otherNazi leader would gain anything by removing him. If Hitler were, on the otherhand, to get rid of, e.g., Himmler, the effect would not be a change of politicalregime, but rather a weakening of political control which would open the door toother political forces. It would be a prelude to the kind of political change forwhich we are looking, not the change itself. The capitalists and industrialistsof the Rdchling type now exercise a large measure of control over the economicwar effort. They hold a position which would enable them to put pressure behindany demands they wished to make. But it is most improbable that they wouldtake the lead. They would, however, be powerful allies in any move initiated bythe generals. Similarly, the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church are too strong,owing to their influence in Germany and their position in a world organisation,to be defied or suppressed by the Nazis. They, too. could back their demands bythreats, but they, too, should be regarded more as useful allies of other groupsthan as a group which would take the initiative itself. In theory there are alsothe Socialist and Communist organisations. But, in practice, the Communist and social Democrat leaders are nearly all dead, in exile or in concentration camps,and their party organisations are broken up. While it is true that, if the processof weakening the police machinery by withdrawals to the front continues, working class organisations may develop and may ultimately achieve decisive localimportance. e.g.. in the Rhineland there is nothing to be hoped for from them at this stage.6. There remain the generals. They will be the first to realise fully theextent of Germany&apos;s military and economic weakness, and they are in a positionto go to Hitler and say, &quot; if you do not meet our demands, we cannot be responsiblefor the consequences.&quot; The very fact that Hitler has already dismissed a numberof generals and taken responsibility on his own shoulders strengthens their position.   He has played his last card; he can go no further along these lines:
he can only retreat. Furthermore, the fact that he has got rid of those generals,who might oppose him for political reasons does not eliminate the possibility1of a move among the generals who remain. Their motives would be practical,nob political. They would act as military experts, not as anti-Nazis. In 1918it was the generals who told the Government that it must sue for an armistice,and they were not politically disloyal.7. If we imagine that the generals come to realise that victory is impossible,but still believe that a proper conduct of affairs might produce a military dead-lock, then it is evident that their aim would be to make themselves masters intheir own houses without producing a revolution, since a revolution woulddefeat their object by destroying Germany^ power to resist. They would try to achieve their aim quietly and&quot; without publicity, using the strength of their position to coerce the politicians. The steps they would be most likely to takeare :  (a) To oust Hitler from direct personal control of strategy.(&amp;) To remove from positions of effective power those generals appointed byHitler who are inefficient or unsympathetic, and perhaps to restoresome dismissed generals to their posts.(c) To intervene in matters of economic policy and control, especially in thespheres of man-power and transport.(d) To demand influence over propaganda to the Home Front and the armed forces.(c) To obtain influence over foreign policy.8. It is not to be expected that the generals would be unanimous in thesematters. There would be a cleavage among them, and the majority who gottheir way would not necessarily include those now occupying the highest positions.There would also probably.be collaboration betAveen the generals and some of theindustrialists, the religious leaders, and highly placed individuals in the civilservice who were Avell disposed. The action AArould have a double purpose. ItAvould be an attempt made, perhaps Avith little hope of success, to stave offdefeat. But it would also enable the generals and their friends to manoeuvrethemselves into a better position for taking more drastic action should it prove necessary to sue for peace9. If the attempt to save Germany from defeat failed and it proved necessary to sue for peace, the generals Avould be in a dilemma. The politicalchanges necessary before the United Nations Avould consent to treat Avith germany are more obvious and more far-reaching than they w7ere in 1918. Also, any move to bring them about is likely to produce a revolution Avhich might lead to civil war, leaving no power in Germany capable of negotiating with the enemy. In1918 the revolution broke out among the people, and the generals tried to minimiseits consequences. The majority of the generals persuaded the Kaiser to abdicateand refused to support the proposal that he should lead the armies against thepeople. They deserted the Kaiser, in spite of their oath; they would have lessscruple about deserting Hitler and might even be prepared to take the initiative in demanding his removal, which, in 1918, was taken by the Socialists. But, ifit is true that this time the people are likely to remain acquiescent and obedientto the end, it follows that this time the generals would have to take the initiative in promoting a revolution, whereas last time they only tried to make the best ofa revolution which had already broken out. And -that is a step they will wishto avoid at all costs.10. One possible course open to them would be, instead of promotingpolitical changes as a prelude to suing for peace, to sue for peace as a preludeto promoting political changes. They might act on their own responsibility, notremoving the Government but ignoring it. They and their friends who would now become more important might approach the enemy, probably clandestinely,trying to play off the Russians against the Western Powers, and, saying, in effect,&quot; if you will strengthen our hands by enabling us to tell the German people thatthey can end the Avar on reasonable terms if they change their political regime,then we shall be able to bring about the necessary changes.&quot; Ever since thebeginning of the Avar feelers of this kind have been put out, though it has never been quite clear-with what purpose. Our reaction has always been to ignore theseapproaches and it is certain that we should continue to do so and urge theGovernments of the United States and Union1 of Soviet Socialist Republics to dothe same.  The generals must act before Ave talk.[25137] B 2
11. To sum up. it is possible to envisage a number of situations, arising inthe last stages of the war : (1) The least likely is a request for an armistice from Hitler to the three major Powers or to one of them either through the diplomatic or military channel. The answer woidd no doubt be an absolute refusal to treat with him (or for that matter with Goring, who is the only other Nazi leader who could play that role).(2) The disintegration of all organised order in Germany. This might result from revolutionary outbreaks coincident with or arising out ofa clash between the army and the party, leading to civil war;or it might arise from a realisation on the part of the army that the elimination of the party would be so enormously difficult a task that itwould be better to fight on to the bitter end.(3) The possibility of internal chaos in Germany in the&apos;final stages of thewar should not be underestimated, it has. however, generally beenheld that the army would at all costs seek to avoid such a development and that, when a stage had been reached where a unanimous feelingexisted amongst officers of all grades that further resistance was hope-less and that the continuation of fighting would only mean huge andsenseless losses amongst the soldiers and, possibly, the civilian population, the army would take it into its own hands to sue for aharmistice. Ignoring the possibility that they might do so beforeeliminating the Nazi leaders, since we should refuse to treat untilthat had been done, there are two alternatives :  (a) The army might seek terms on a purely military basis, eitherseparately with one or concurrently with the main AlliedPowers, having first eliminated the chief Nazi leaders buthaving substituted no other civilian Government in their place.(b) The Nazi leaders having been eliminated, or ha\ing voluntarilywithdrawn, the army might support the establishment of ,icivilian Government, consisting of certain Conservativepolitical, industrial and. possibly, religious groups, and headed by someone like Schacht or von Papen. This government might seek terms, in the name of the German Army and people,either by direct appeal to the Head of one or more of the majorAllied Powers or through neutral intermediaries, eg., the vatican or the Swedish. Spanish or Turkish Governments.STAGE  II.\What are likely to be the internal conditions in Germany at the time of a request for an armistice and what should be the guiding principles of the allied occupation?1. For the purposes of this paper it is assumed that none of the three major powers will treat with the    Hitler clique,&quot; to whose elimination all are pledged.&apos;2. The argument of the paper will not be materially affected even if. as aresult of Germany going down fighting or of the outbreak of revolutionary move-men ts, no central military or civilian authority survives.3. Broadly speaking, however, this paper is based on the assumption thatin the final stages the German Army will probably take charge either directly or by putting forward a puppet civilian Government.4. Hitler and the German High Command have made an intensive study of developments, political and military, in 1918 which led up to the German collapse.There is also much we can learn from a perusal of the two valuable memorandaprepared by Mr. Grey of the Library entitled : &quot; The German Collapse in 1918 &quot;and &apos;; The German Revolution of 1918.&quot; The latter memorandum is particularlyvaluable in trying to assess what may be the political developments in germany in the final stages before defeat, and the manner in which the United Nations(in practice the Soviet, British and United States Governments) should handle the situation.5. In the early part of 1918 the particular form of Parliamentary Govern-ment which had developed out of the Imperial Constitution drawn up after the france-Prussian war was still functioning.   But the Chancellor^ position had
been weakened by conflict with the High Command and by the fact that he wasno longer able entirely to ignore criticism in the Reichstag. Ultimate politicalpower had thus come to rest in the hands of the Higher Command, which meant,in practice, of Ludendorff. When, at the end of September 1918, the extent ofthe German failure in the West had become apparent, there was a significant change. In his parting message when accepting Chancellor Hertling&apos;s resigna-tion. the Kaiser made this announcement : &quot; I desire that the German peopleshall co-operate more effectively than hitherto in deciding the destiny of theFatherland. It is, therefore, my wi 11 that men who are sustained by a people&apos;strust shall, to a wide extent, co-operate in the rights and duties of government.&apos;&quot;Prince Max of Baden was appointed Chancellor, and the Reichstag wassummoned. Prince Max had the reputation of holding Liberal views, and in theGovernment which he formed Ivrzberger, of the Centrum, and Scheidemann, the leader of the Majority Socialists, were appointed Secretaries of State withoutportfolios, while another Socialist, David, was appointed Under-Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs. The first step towards the democratisation of theEmpire had thus been taken, and the first act of the new Government was to askPresident Wilson to initiate peace negotiations on the basis of his ownprogramme, and to request the immediate conclusion of an armistice. In his speech to the Reichstag on the 5th October the new Chancellor stated that that body would now assume a more important position in the governance of theEmpire (in which connexion he mentioned the Governments acceptance ofthe Reichstag&apos;s peace resolution of duly 1917) and spoke of the reform of the prussian franchise. Bills were introduced for the formation of a ReichstagCommittee to work in co-operation with the Chancellor and to amend theImperial Constitution in such a way that the Reichstag would be jointlyresponsible with the Emperor and the Government for decisions on vital questionsof war and peace. The only real opposition to the constitutional changes came from the Conservatives.5a. It is important to recall these developments in 1918 because it is not impossible that an attempt may be made to repeat them. It is true that parliamentary Government in Germany has been extinct for the last ten years.But it should be remembered that the Weimar Constitution provided one of themost democratic methods of election which has ever been worked, out, based on an elaborate system of proportional representation. The relevant articles of theWeimar Constitution have never been abrogated. It would therefore be perfectlypossible to stage an election in Germany and to present the United Nations witha democratically elected representative central German Government, behind whichthe Army might try to shelter.6. It may again be useful to revert to 1918 and to consider the attitude adopted by the Allies to Prince Max&apos;s Government. It may be said that, in theearly stages, the attitude of the Allies was one of close interest as betokening the weakening of an enemy whom it was their firm intention to defeat as decisivelyas possible. When, therefore, Prince Max addressed his message to PresidentWilson, the question was considered by His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Frenchand the Italian Governments primarily from the military angle : the Allies weresuspicious as to the genuineness of the German change of heart, and there was no guarantee that changes made in the constitutional procedure would not be cancelledat an opportune moment; at a meeting at Paris, attended by Mr. Lloyd George,M. Clemenceau and Signor Orlando on the 6th October, the first-named expressedthe view that a statement which Prince Max had made of proposed peace termsindicated that they really meant nothing at all for example, autonomy only was proposed for Alsace-Lorraine. It was agreed that the question of an armisticewas very largely a military one, which was therefore referred to the militarychiefs/ On the following day M. Clemenceau expressed the opinion that theAllies must adopt the principle of asking for guarantees, by the occupation ofcertain points, which would make their military position secure; the Allies must,not expose themselves to the reproach of risking the lives of thousands of mensimply because they would not accede to reasonable conditions, but, on the otherhand, measures must be taken to guard against treachery. Mr. Bonar Law andMr. Lloycl George also expressed concern at the possibility that the armies ofthe Allies, if they once stopped fighting, might not be induced to fight again.7. rl&apos;he political, as opposed to the purely military aspect, was dealt withby President &quot;Wilson in his exchange of correspondence with the german chancellor, and in his first note, dated the 8th October, the President enquired
whether the Imperial Chancellor was speaking merely for the constitutedauthorities of the Empire who had up till that time been conducting the war.The German reply of the 12th October contained the assurance that the existingGerman Government, which had taken the responsibility for the step towardspeace, had been formed by negotiations and in agreement with the great majorityof the Reichstag, and stated that the Chancellor, supported in all his actionsby the will of the majority, was speaking in the name of the German Governmentand of the German people. This, however, was not enough, and, in his reply ofthe 14th October. President Wilson stated that there must be no possibility of a misunderstanding, and called attention to bis condition that every arbitraryPower capable of its single choice of disturbing the peace of the world must be destroyed or reduced to impotency: he stated that the power which had controlledthe German nation was of the nature described, that the whole process of peacewould depend upon the definiteness and satisfactory character of the guaranteesgiven in this respect, and that it was indispensable that the Governmentsassociated against Germany should know beyond a peradventure with whom theywere dealing. The German note of the 20th October replied to this point by stating that a fundamental change had occurred in Germany: a new Governmenthad been formed in complete accord with the desires of a Parliament elected underequal, general, secret and direct suffrage; the leaders of the great parties wereamongst its members; in future no Government could enter upon or carry on itsoffice without possessing the confidence of a Reichstag majority; the responsibilityof the Imperial Chancellor towards Parliament was being legally extended andsafeguarded; the Government was free from all arbitrary and irresponsibleinfluence and was supported by the overwhelming majority of the German people.President Wilson&apos;s reply of the 23rd October made it clear that he was still not satisfied, but the German note of the 27th October stated that the peacenegotiations would be conducted by a people&apos;s Government, in whose hands restedboth actually and constitutionally the power to make deciding conclusions.After this events moved swiftly: Luclendorff fell at the end of October, revolu-tioimry outbreaks occurred at the beginning of November, the abdication of theEmperor was announced on the 9th November, and on the same day Prince Maxresigned the Chancellorship: the armistice was signed two days later. It willbe noted that the Presidents refusal to be satisfied by the earlier Germanovertures in no way stiffened German resistance or delayed the German collapse.8. Prince Max&apos;s Government in 1918 was infinitely more representativethan any civilian Government can possibly be which may emerge in the final stages of this war. It is submitted therefore that our first aim should be to secure theagreement of the United States and Soviet Governments (1) to an insistence onthe armistice being negotiated between soldiers (otherwise the German soldiersand even the German people may later repudiate the civilian Government as theGerman negotiators at Versailles were afterwards repudiated); and (2) to a refusal, anyhow to begin with, to recognise or to transact business with whatevercivilian Government may emerge in Germany (as distinct from the centraladministrative machine, which clearly cannot be dispensed with at first).9. In a separate paper (Stage III;, it is argued that the completedismemberment of Germany is not practicable as a long-term policy, and thatit would equally be unwise to imagine that it would be possible to impose on germany a federal system. It is suggested, however, that total defeat is likely,for political and practical reasons, to foster in Germany in the early stages astrong tendency towmrds regional particularism and possibly even towardsseparatism. Everything possible should be done, during &quot; the period ofoccupation, to encourage, but not to impose, such a tendency.110. The following measures are suggested with a view to helping on theprocess of decentralisation :  (a) The total military occupation of Germany.(b) Refusal to recognise or transact business with any Central Governmentin Berlin.(c) A joint announcement immediately after the armistice that,  (1) norecognised Central Government existed, and (2) that the occupyingforces would deal with the regional or provincial authorities. (special arrangements would, in fact, have to be made for dealing centrallywith certain services. Transport would no doubt be placed undermilitary control. Banking will, however, be a verv difficult problem,indeed, inflation may be inevitable.)
(d) In 1918 officials, generally speaking, carried on and there was no wide-spread breakdown in civilian administration. It is no doubt truethat in the higher posts of&apos; the central and throughout the localadministrations there are to-day many Nazis. But if chaos is tobe avoided, it seems vital that the essential services should continueto function. Here, again, a joint announcement might be made,inviting the regional authorities, in their own interests, to carry on.But a serious problem will arise. Party influence goes very deep, andit will be impossible to remove all Nazi influence at once without dislo-cating the German machinery of Government. This situation will call for careful handling on the part of the occupying authorities, who may even be covertly exploited by Nationalist groups to suppressLiberal movements which it would be to our interest to support.(e) If, as will presumably he the case, an Armistice Commission is set up,it might be desirable that its headquarters should not be in Berlin,but at some central provincial capital such as Dresden.(/) The training of suitable liaison personnel with the tact, ability and necessary knowledge of Germany to implement whatever policy is agreed.STAGE III.The future of Germany.1. Article 8 of the Atlantic Charter lays down : &quot; . . . . Since no futurepeace can be maintained if land, sea .or air armaments continue to be employedby nations which tin-eaten or may threaten aggression outside of their frontiers,they believe, pending the establishment of a wider permanent system of general security, that the disarmament of such nations is essential. . . . .&quot; The first lineof defence, therefore, against a repetition of German aggression is the disarma-ment of Germany and the prevention of rearmament. Bitter experience, however,has shown that, with time, the will to enforce the necessary measures may weaken ;and though this time we may have learnt our lesson, it is desirable to consider what additional measures, having the nature of reinsurance, should be applied toGermany.2. Among the measures suggested for providing security against german aggression in the future, various proposals have been put forward for imposingon Germany in the peace settlement structural changes which would weaken ordestroy the political unity of the territories which constituted ITitler&apos;s Reich atthe outbreak of the war. Five different types of policy may usefully be distinguished.3. The first of these is to deprive a defeated Germany not only of all the territories she has occupied in the course of the war, but also of those which sheacquired by acts or threats of aggression before the war, including Austria, the sudeten areas and Memel, as well as the &quot; Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.&quot;This policy would leave pxe-Anschluss Germany intact. Since it has beenclearly stated that the United Nations do not recognise any German claim to these territories based on the events of 1938-39, it is assumed that there will.be generalagreement among the United Nations that Germany should, in any case, be deprived of these territories after the war. But it may equally be assumed thatthe Allies would, not rest content with this action alone. After it has been taken,four possible courses of further action will remain. These are here discussed indescending order of severity.4. The second and most radical type of policy is dismemberment. This ishere taken to mean the destruction of Germany as a political entity by splitting-it into pieces or by deliberately encouraging separatist tendencies. Dismember-ment would leave no single State called Germany in existence. There would remain merely a number of independent German States. Thus South Germanyand Old Prussia might be lopped off, leaving an amorphous region in the centre and north-west. It would be difficult to devise any reasonable political structurefor this area, since it is one in which the traditional German Lander areintricately interlocked. Subdivision into independent States would involvecreating arbitrary new political units, resulting in a state of affairs which wouldhave little chance of becoming stabilised. If, on the other&apos; hand, Old Prussia were allowed to remain united with this residual territory to the west of it, there would
sresult a largely Prussian North German State a sort of New Prussia, of by nomeans negligible size and industrial power. There would thus be, in all proba-bility, three independent, or quasi-independent, German States : North Germany(this new Prussia with Saxony), Western Germany (the Rhine-Ruhr area) andSouth Germany (Baden, Wiirttemberg and Bavaria). To perpetuate such asystem, strong political control to prevent their reunion would have to be addedto the economic, control necessary to prevent rearmaments. It&apos;might be found possible by deliberately fostering local separatist tendencies to split Germany up into more than three States but it seems likely that the more radical the degreeof dismemberment imposed the harder it would be to prevent the independentunits from drawing together as soon as a desire for union developed within themand the Allied determination to oppose such reunion had weakened with thepassage of time.5. The third type of policy may be called truncation. It consists inlopping off extensive frontier areas from Germany with the object of ensuring that ttie remaining &quot;Rump State&quot; should be too weak to constitute a danger to the peace of Europe, it would be definitely a security measure and wouldnot be based on the specific territorial claims of Germany&apos;s neighbours. Forexample, in 1918 the Danish Government claimed only those parts of Slesvigwhose inhabitants wished for incorporation in Denmark; but a policy oftruncation might demand the cession, for strategic reasons, of both Slesvig andHolstein, with or without their German populations, so as to deprive germany of the Kiel Canal. hi 1918 there was a French proposal that. Germanyswestern frontier should be on the Rhine; but a thorough-going policy oftruncation might demand the detachment from the Reich of the principalindustrial areas on the right bank of the river, including the Ruhr, in orderto deprive Germany of her most important source of war potential. After thelast war the Polish claim to Allenstein, in East Prussia, was considered strong-enough to be put to the test of a plebiscite; but truncation might Well resultin detaching from Germany the whole of East Prussia together with its Germanpopulation. Truncation would probably involve the transfer of considerableGerman populations to non-German States, since the Rump German state would be unable to absorb all the German populations, who might otherwise betransferred. Unlike dismemberment it would mean that a German &quot; RumpState&quot; would be left, in which strong irredentist feelings would be certain to arise. This Rump State would exert a pull on the severed parts but it wouldbe one to which they could not respond without defying the political authorities under whose direct control they had been placed. A thorough-going policy oftruncation would mean the constant maintenance of an armed force byGermanvA neighbours.6. The fourth type of policy may be described as frontier rectification. it includes claims advanced by Germany&apos;s neighbours to alter, to their advantage,their frontiers with Germany. These claims may be based on historic, ethnic,economic or strategic considerations. Obvious examples are the Polish claims to Upper Silesia and the Allenstein province of East Prussia, and Denmark&apos;claim to North Slesvig put forward after the Last war. Unlike truncation,frontier rectification could, be accompanied by the evacuation to the Reich ofat least a considerable proportion of the German inhabitants of the transferredterritories, so as to render the latter more readily assimilable by the beneficiarystates. Thus the cession to Poland of Upper Silesia, although hardly that of east Prussia, accompanied by wholesale transfers of populations would fall into this category.7. The fifth and last type of proposal is that Germany should bedecentralised, that is to say. reorganised on a federal basis. The process ofdecentralisation might or might not entail the removal of the control of militaryand foreign affairs from the hands of the Central Government. A federalsolution in Germany would he likely to benefit the world by reducing the clangerof German aggression. It is also not out of harmony with Germany&apos;s politicalcharacter and historic evolution, and it might afford the German people the best chance of developing a stable democratic regime. It might, in fact, he regardedas a contribution to the &quot; re-education &quot; of Germany. In discussing the federalsolution, however, it is important to distinguish between compulsory and voluntary federation. The former assumes that federalism would be imposed by force from outside on an unwilling people and maintained by force against their will.   It would, in fact, share most of the features of dismemberment or
truncation. It is, however, possible to envisage a situation, particularly during;the occupation of Germany, in which external influence could be exerted to foster the natural development of particularist sentiment and to encourage theestablishment of federal constitution such as could be maintained without the direct application of outside forces.8. In considering which of these policies -dismemberment, truncation,frontier rectification or federation, whether compulsory or voluntary should beapplied to Germany in addition to the restoration of the 1937 frontiers, it is firstnecessary to try to assess the strength of the centripetal political forces inGermany. What, in fact, have been the forces that have led to the unification of the German people, through the stages of the Empire and the Weimar Republic,into the centralised Reich of Adolf Hitler?9. German nationalism, in its modern form, cannot be traced back beyondthe early years of the 19th century, but it owed something of its strength to thetradition of a German unity of a different kind which had been established inthe Middle Ages. Modern Germans think in terms of an historical continuitybetween the First Reich of the Holy Roman Empire and the Third Reich of hitler. This tradition owes much to the fact that the concept of German unityis based on the idea of the people rather than on the idea of the State. It hasnot been dependent on the continuance of any particular political structure, andit is therefore unlikely that it would be destroyed by the destruction of thepolitical entity to which it is now attached. It might adapt itself to new politicalforms, even, perhaps, to new ideas as to the nature of national sovereignty, butit would be strong enough to deny stability to a system, such as dismemberment,which refused it all recognition.ID. During the last hundred years or more the component parts of Germanyhave been brought ever closer together. German, unity has become stronger andmore compact, and this development has found champions in all the main political camps, among the romantics and the liberals, the creators and upholdersof the Second Reich, the makers of the Weimar Republic, and the NationalSocialists. This movement was at times opposed, even to the point of war:, but itsopponents quickly accepted the unity, once it had been established, because thedesire for unity was stronger than the dislike of the particular form in which itwas obtained. Thereafter regional sentiment was particularist rather thanseparatist in character, and the advocates of particularism were not prepared topress their claims to the point where they would seriously endanger the existenceof a united Germany.11. It was natural that centrifugal forces should manifest themselves inthe period after the last war, when the terms of the peace treaty and the issue ofthe revolution wore both still in doubt. It is likely that they &quot;will do so again,and perhaps even more strongly, after this war for two reasons. In 1918 mostparticularists did not try to reverse recent trends, in the sense of demanding ahigher degree of local autonomy than they had enjoyed under the Empire. their main concern was to resist the further centralising tendencies of Weimar. ButNational Socialism has gone much further with centralisation, and this mayprovoke a reaction to the opposite extreme, to the belief that regional self-governments-provided it can be combined with a considerable measure of economic unity which, as the experience of the past century has shown, confers great benefits on the regions is a sine qua non of political progress. In the second place,the internal chaos after this war is likely to be greater than after the last. if for a time no stable Central Government emerges, the regions will necessarily hethrown on their own resources and will endeavour to solve their own local problems in their own way. If their efforts meet with success, the result may be to lay the foundations of a more decentralised political system. Sharp political differencesmight result in the predominance of divergent political trends of thought incertain regions, for instance, of Communism in the Rhineland or some&quot; other-industrial area, or of the Catholicism associated with the Centre Party in SouthGermany. Such a development would give greater and more lasting force toparticularism, as it did in the 1920&apos;s. If this happened it would be a healthydevelopment which we should clo our best to encourage. On the other hand itmust be borne in mind that particularist feelings which arise in this wayimmediately after defeat are likely to lose much of their force when internal conditions and the policy of the United Nations make the establishment of a central Government possible. It can, moreover, be regarded as certain that the[25137] c
ultimate aim of the Communists at any rate would be, not regional autonomy,but the seizure of power in a united Germany.12. Athough particularist tendencies, therefore, might well be strongerafter tins war than after the last, there is no reason to believe that the same willbe true of separatist feeling. In 1918 Germans who held that they had been the victims of a policy which they had been unable to control might reasonably havefixed the blame on Prussia and the Prussian military caste, and concluded thattheir salvation lay in separating themselves completely from Prussia and fromany group of German States of which she was a member. But, in fact, suchideas did not prevail. The German people sought salvation, instead, in a nationalpolitical revolution and in a constitution which, it was hoped, would curb thepoAver of Prussia. After this war the blame for the disastrous policy pursued will rest on the National Socialists, whose regime is not. based on the power of Prussia.Its foundations are ideological, not local, and all parts of the Reich have beenin varying degrees infected by it. in fact. National Socialism was at one stagestrongest &quot;in Bavaria and Thuringia and weakest in Prussia itself.13. The above outline should suffice to show that, while early after the war there may be a tendency, for practical as well as polii ical reasons, in the directionof particularism and even separatism in certain parts of Germany, any tendency towards true separatism is likely to be shortlived. A permanent disintegrationof the German Reich is unlikely to occur spontaneously or to he willingly accepted,if imposed from without. It is therefore difficult to escape the conclusion thata policy involving the dismemberment or even the severe truncation of Germany,though it would no doubt be enforceable in the early stages, would be littleconducive to the establishment of a permanent system of world security.14 The strength of the centripetal forces in Germany has already been referred to. On the economic side, any dismemberment of Germany drastic-enough to prevent a concerted plan for rearmament would at the same time strike a severe blow at her general economic prosperity. The German economy hasbeen built up as a unity. The economic differences between regions aremanifestations of that unity, and regional specialisation is evidence of regionalinter-dependence. If existing connections were destroyed, the system could notfunction until a drastic reorganisation had taken place. Even then, if economic or political barriers prevented full and free co-operation between the dismemberedparts, some of these at least would be seriously impoverished, while the destructionof the unity of the social services would cause a lowering of the standard of welfare in some areas. Politically, it is almost certain that the several parts ofa dismembered Germany would seek to escape from political isolation along the path indicated by their economic interests, namely, by federation with one another. The process would be similar to that in the 19th century, when the.Zollverein paved the way to political unity.15. The question then arises whether the victor Powers would have the will to prevent this process and, if they had the will, whether they could devise anypracticable means of doing so. It must be remembered that this movement towards reunion would be supported in Germany, not only by aggressivenationalists, but also by the very men whose influence the victor Powers wish tosee increased by those Liberals and Social Democrats who have survivedtotalitarianism. It would, moreover, be urged by some sections of opinion wdthinthe victor countries that the suppression of such a movement by force would be both contrary to world interests and in conflict with political ethics as set outin the Atlantic Charter, in that it would mean the denial to the Germans of thefundamental political right to choose their own form of government, when therewas no evidence of any present intention to abuse that right in such a way as toimperil world security. In such circumstances it would be highly probable that,before very long, concessions would be made, and experience shows that, once atreaty has been breached under pressure, the breach tends to grow wider. Thepassage from economic agreements to full economic collaboration, and from political understandings to federation and, finally, to political unification, maybe a very gradual one,, and once the process had begun, it would be difficult todecide where to call a halt. The stability of the peace settlement would beimperilled by uncertainty as to what exactly it prohibited and by the notionthat its provisions could be graded according to the degree in which it wasnecessary to enforce them. Disagreement among the Allies would be a likelyconsequence of such a situation.
16. The foregoing arguments apply equally to the policy of truncation.German populations forcibly detached from the Reich may be expectedpermanently to look back&apos; to Germany, and it seems unlikely that neighbouringStates would be either (a) willing or (&amp;) sufficiently strong to discharge theresponsibility of ensuring the permanent separation of their German minoritiesfrom the German homeland. The Rhineland is a case in point. Though it mightbe strategically desirable that the territory on the left bank of the Rhine shouldbe ceded to France, it seems unlikely that the French people would be able and willing to shoulder the responsibility involved. Moreover, control of the left bankof the Rhine is only part of the problem. What is even more important is to diminish Germany&apos;s power to make war by taking from her, or at leastcontrolling, the vitally important part of her war potential centred in the ruhr-Rhine area. There seem to be only two practicable alternatives : (a) thepolitical detachment of the Rhineland from Germany, either with a view tosetting up a separate Rhenish province or to incorporating it in some new bufferconfederation (Wallonia), or (b) the retention of the Rhineland in Germany andthe establishment of some form of direct control over the whole economic war potential of Germany. It is almost certain that the will to maintain the politicaldetachment of the Rhineland from Germany would gradually weaken in the face of the inevitable resistance which such a measure would provoke among theGerman people. The creation of a WallOnian Confederation hardly seemspractical politics. The solution therefore would seem to lie in a system of direct control of German economic war potential rather than in the detachment of the ruhr-Rhine area from Germany.17. The objections described above would also apply in lesser degree to thefederal solution, if this were imposed compulsorily from without.&apos; Mere negativesanctions, mere orders to abstain from doing certain things, would not suffice toestablish and maintain a federation against the wishes of the German people,since a federal constitution is something that demands positive collaboration. Itseems unlikely that such collaboration could be permanently maintained by force.Moreover, the imposition of a particular form of government on Germany as acondition of peace would conflict with the principle enunciated in Article 3 ofthe Atlantic Charter, while the balance of power in a federal constitution is sodelicate a matter that it would be impossible to specify in advance what internal political changes would constitute a breach of the Peace Treaty.18. On the other hand, the objections to the policy described as frontierrectification seem less serious and in certain areas the cession of German frontierterritories, accompanied by transfers of population, will no doubt prove possible and necessary. It may be taken for granted that the cession of any territory which formed part of the pre-1937 Reich would arouse irredentist feeling amongthe German people. In considering such cessions it is therefore important torealise (a) that the transfer of territory, however great its strategic value, isonly an aid to and not a substitute for other security measures and (6) that theState to which the territory is transferred must have both the will and the ability to hold and to assimilate it. It would, for example, be not unreasonable to expect that Poland would be able and willing to surmount the problems involved by the transfer to her of East Prussia and the Oppeln district of Silesia. the cession of these areas to Poland is desirable both on political and strategicalgrounds and has the additional advantage of depriving Germany of the richindustrial districts of Silesia. It is, on the other, unlikely that France or either ofthe Low Countries would be able or willing to hold and assimilate the Rhinelandand/or the Ruhr.19. There remains the solution described as voluntary federation. Thiswould in many respects be the best long-term solution and the most favourablemeans of encouraging a more reasonable and less aggressive Government of theGerman Reich. Its practicability will depend upon the strength of theparticularist movements which may be expected to develop after the war and uponthe skill with which the Allies foster them. Some of the measures which mightbe taken to this end are indicated in the final paragraph of &quot; Stage II.&apos;&quot;&apos;20. It is suggested in conclusion that the following measures, having as their object the limitation of Germany&apos;s power to make war, would bestrategically necessary, politically expedient and economically desirable and wouldhave a reasonable chance of surviving as part of a permanent peace settlement,
provided always the victorious Powers retained over a sufficiently long period apreponderance of armed strength and the will to use it in case of need (a) Restoration of a free and independent Austria, possibly connected withsome Central European Confederation.(b) Restoration of Czechoslovakia, possibly with minor agreed  frontierrectifications if in the Eger triangle.(c) Restoration to France of Alsace-Lorraine.(d) Cession to Poland of East Prussia, Danzig and the Oppeln district ofSilesia.(V) The transfer (if desired) of control of the Kiel Canal to the united nations.(/) Restoration of pre-war territorial status qua in the Low Countries andLuxemburg.(g) The acceptance of some  form of international  control of  industry generally, and particularly in the Rhineland.(h) If spontaneous particularist or even separatist movements were to appearafter the war, they should be encouraged, with a view to the possible development of a federal Germany. Federation cannot be imposedor maintained by force of arms, but any opportunity of encouragingits natural and healthy growth, should be taken.
