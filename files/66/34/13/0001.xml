DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYJg GOVERNMENT.Itb February, 1 9U3.WAR CABINET.cory NO. J *CEREALS FOR THE INDIAN OCEAN AREA.NOTE BY THE MINISTER OF WAR TRANSPORT;1.      I have received a number of demands for delivery ofcereals within the next few months to countries in theIndian Ocean area.      These are required to fill gaps untilthe next harvest becomes available and are based on estimates of the cereals remaining from last year&apos;s crop.      It isdifficult to  tell how far these estimates are reliable,  asthe full extent of stocks in these countries is difficult toascertain.The demands are for supplies to the following countries:-2.&apos;d&apos;India.India.Mauritius, Reunion, Seychelles.South Africa,  Southern RhodesiaNorthern Rhodesia and Kenya.Ceylon.Turkey.PersiaMiddleEaSt.Apart from an existing military requirement (which wewere already meeting) of some 15,000 tons a month, Indiaasked for 200,000 tons of cereals by end April.      Therequest was referred by the Shipping Committee to theLord Presidents Committee, v/ho decided that an additionalUo/50,000 tons should be provided out of tonnage whichwould otherwise have been available for the U.K.  import programme.      The Committee also considered that by economies and by diverting shipping based on India or under Indiancontrol, an additional 80,000 tons could be provided;against this India has so far provided 1+8,000 tons.      I havealready made the necessary diversions to cover 1+6,000 tons for February and March loading,  apart from 27,000 tons on military account.3.      Mauritius, Reunion, Seychelles.Supplies totalling 7,500 tons of wheat and flour were asked for, made up of 5,000 tons for Mauritius, 1,500 tons for Reunion and 200 tons a month, for Seychelles.      TheShipping Committee considered that this demand should be met and a vessel has been allocated accordingly.h.      South Africa,  Southern Rhodesia, Northern rhodesia and Kenya.Requirements for these areas are 22,500 tons maizefor South Africa, 30,000 tons maize for Kenya, in additionto from 16,000 tons on military account, 6,000 tons maizefor Northern Rhodesia and 8,000 tons wheat for SouthernRhodesia.      The Kenya demand can be abated by 3,000 tonsand replaced by butter beans from Madagascar, which theMinister of Food has made available and which can be shippedwithout difficulty.

The Shipping Committee considered -(a) that no British controlled tonnage should be diverted to meet the South African demand,(b) that the Southern Rhodesia request should be deferred until further evidence is available,and(c) that the possibility of obtaining Argentine orother neutral ships to bring maize from SouthAmerica for South and East Africa, should be explored.The position in Northern Rhodesia has since improved and there is now a possibility of meeting their require-ments from the Congo.      The question of the diversion to east Africa of a cargo of wheat and maize originallyarranged in a Swedish ship for Northern Rhodesia from theArgentine is now under consideration.      There seems little likelihood of obtaining further tonnage in time for any ofthese demands.With regard to (a) the High Commissioner indicated at a recent meeting that he did not wish to press SouthAfrica&apos;s demand unduly.5.     Ceylon.Owing to the failure of India to supply Ceylon withrice, we have had to ship wheat and flour, totalling over130,000 tons, from Australia in the last few months.Negotiations are now proceeding in an endeavour to obtainrice from Egypt.The present demand is for 15*000 tons a month inFebruary and March and 30,000 tons a month thereafter,less any rice obtained from Egypt.The Shipping Committee recommended that three cargoes of flour should be loaded in Australia in February.Three prompt ships are being ordered to Colombo at theexpense of the U.K.  import programme.6.     Turkey.Turkey has asked for 150,000 tons of cereals as soonas possible.      We hope to be able to meet 50,000 tonswithout any direct demand on shipping, but these localsupplies could otherwise have been used in the Middle Eastand saved the shipment of supplies to that area.The Shipping Committee recommended that 100,000 tonsof cereals from overseas should be sent to Turkey duringthe next five months.      Supplies would come from Australia,but I should be in great difficulty in obtaining thenecessary tonnage for the next three months,  in additionto that required for other commitments to the Indian Oceanar*ea, and we should have to look to the Turks to provideon-carriage from the Delta.Persia.Persia has asked urgently for h5,000 tons of wheat for shipment by the end of May.      This has been accepted as aOoint British and American responsibility and, so far asthe cereals cannot be carried in ships bringing military stores from North America, they should be covered by-2-

American Russian-aid ships, since the demand arose&quot;&quot;partly because of requirements of Russian troops in persia.      The commitment can be substantially covered in this way.8.      Middle East.Under the reduced programme 20,000 tons of cerealsare required monthly, and I hope to cover the whole ofthis quantity from North America as part of the minimum import programme of the Middle East Supply Centre.9*      Tonnage Availability.After meeting existing commitments to India,Mauritius, Reunion, Seychelles and Ceylon there will be one non-refrigerated ship available in Australia between now and the end of Marcho     This ship would normallyhave loaded for the U.K. but if necessary could be diverted to Egypt for Turkey.      If this were done, onlyrefrigerated ships would be left in the Australia/U.K.programme.     This would cover almost all U.K.  generalcargo requirements from Australia, but would be insufficient to cover bulk liftings, such as cereals,sugar and zinc concentrates.If this last ship is switched, a total of sixteenships will have been provided at the expense of the Tjrx,programme during February and March.      This would represent a loss to our imports of about 70,000 tons.There would still remain a deficiency of four shipson the total Indian Ocean requirements for February/March loading if all the Shipping Committee&apos;srecommendations are accepted.10.      January dry cargo imports were less than,200,000 tons.      In these circumstances I should not feel justified in diverting so much shipping to meetIndian Ocean needs without prior notice to theWar Cabinet.MINISTRY OF WAR TRANSPORT.13th February, 19^3.
