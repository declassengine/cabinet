I feel bound to call attention to the serious effect on home food production if the War Office proposals-are carried intoeffect.2.      The area in question comprising one-sixth of the totalfarm area of the administrative county of the East Riding,  includessome of the best barley land in the county,  and is an area,  which,owing to the size of the farms and the fields, lends itself readilyto mechanised farming - a most important feature having regard tothe general shortage of skilled agricultural labour,that.

It should be remembered that following on the deterioration in the shipping situation as regards food imports, the Ministry ofAgriculture was called upon, towards the end. of 1942,  to endeavourto obtain an increase of at least 200,000 acres of barley for theloaf.      This was additional to an increase of 600,000 acres in thewheat acreage for the 1943 harvest.     Altogether the Ministry isendeavouring to get another 1,000,000 acres of grassland ploughed up.6.     Although it is believed that County Agricultural ExecutiveCommittees have been able to schedule the necessary area and issuedirections,  it remains to be seen whether labour and weather conditions will permit of the whole of this area being actuallyploughed,  sown and cultivated, and the diversion of an area of105,000 acres of land in the East Riding comprising some 80,000 acres of arable and including 25,000 acres of barley will have a mostserious effect both practical and psychological on home foodproduct ion.7.availableBritain isI would point out that the total acreage at present to the War Department for training purposes in Great8,504,846 acres,  of which .2,799,616 acres (includingNorthern Command) are available in EnglandI note the War Office statement that after468,820 acres in theand Wales, and whileextensive reconnaisance the only suitable area of the size1.* A good deal of this would ordinarily be fed to stock.% fa?fa) fa
