The whole matter was governed by political considerations, Turkey, being at present neutral.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was no suggestion of askingTurkey to make any engagement.THE PRESIDENT said he understood that, but there was always thepossibility of Turkish intervention, for example, in the case of anarchy in the balkans, a situation which the Prime Minister mentioned in his note.

SECOND MEETING.(Political.)(Saturday, January 30,-1943.)Present :Right Hon. Winston S. Churchill, j His Excellency General Ismet Inonu,M.P., Prime Minister. President of the Turkish Republic.The Hon. Sir Alexander Cadogan, His Excellency M. Sukru Saracoglu,Permanent Under-Secretary of State President of the Council of Ministers,for Foreign Affairs.Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, His His Excellency M. Numan Menemen-Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Angora. ciogtu. Minister for Foreign Affairs.Speaking of the statement&apos;&quot;&quot;&apos; read by the Prime Minister at the generalmeeting which had taken place earlier, THE PRESIDENT OF THEREPUBLIC expressed agreement with the situation therein described. he agreed that the German advance in Russia had now been stopped, as also theGerman campaign in North Africa. Two dangers only remained; the Germanneed to acquire oil and the danger of the Drang nach Osten. These raised thepossibility of a German attempt later to force her way through &quot; the centre.&quot;THE PRESIDENT expressed the opinion that now the Germans wereretiring in Russia to a position still unknown. Further battles would take placewhen the new line had been formed, and the result would be stabilisation. Thiswould leave Germany with some force with which she could seek a decisionelsewhere, and she might direct her attention to Turkey. Turkey, therefore, mustbe strengthened. On the other hand, if Germany did not attack Turkey, the only other factor which might affect the present Turkish situation would be a state ofchaos in the Balkans.The President then asked questions as regards Allied plans. Did the PrimeMinister expect anything to take place in this part of the world before July, ordid he think the crisis would be in July ?THE PRIME MINSTER remarked that it might be in July, or sooner. Itwas first necessary to clear up Tunisia. He could not say when this would be,but after that the important theatre would be in the Mediterranean basin, which meant that Turkey would be affected.THE PRESIDENT stated that he wished to remain in complete confidencewith Great Britain. This had been done up to now. Though Turkey had not taken an active part in any way TFIE PRIME MINISTER interrupted to saythat he made no reproach against Turkey for this Great Britain had showncomplete comprehension of her attitude. Turkey had done all that was possibleto be of use to British policy. Both in this general policy and after the warTurkey washed to remain attached to Great Britain. The present was a rareoccasion. It must be used to clear our minds as to the different probabilities whichmight present themselves. He asked how the Prime Minister thought Turkeycould collaborate during the war and after the war.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the requirements were : (1) that turkey should be strong, (2) that she should., be ready. She would have to be ableto judge any situation which might arise. He could not prophesy, but perhapsthere might be a moment even this year when Turkey was both strong and ready,and when Great Britain had her plans ready. Then perhaps Turkey might haveviews to offer. There might be anarchy in the Balkans, when disorganisationwould ensue. The President himself had suggested that Turkey might take some action against Germany in certain circumstances. The winter was not over,there might be a collapse in Germany or some change might take place. Turkeymust be ready to throw in her weight when that moment arrives, and whenTurkey&apos;s interests will obviously be involved. The Prime Minister asked for noengagement, but in his view it was very important for Turkey to be among thevictors and to have a seat at the Council which would decide the future after
the war and make arrangements to prevent attacks by one nation on another.]t was hoped to provide security for all peoples. It was important for turkey to be among the victors. Turkey must decide for herself. He thought it wouldbe a good thing for Turkey to have full liberty of decision. The call for a decision might come in six months, or in eighteen. In 1918 the German collapse had come before it was expected.THE PRESIDENT asked, whether if Germany were to collapse soonTurkish co-operation would still be required.THE PRIME MINISTER replied in the affirmative. A collapse could notbe absolutely immediate. There would be further bloodshed and battles. He didnot ask Turkey to act until it was in Turkey&apos;s interests to do so, and in that ofthe grand coalition. But the moment would come. A threat to the Straits might make it necessary for Turkey to act. It was of great importance to destroy the Ploesti oil wells. This would be fatal to Germany. A moment would come when Turkey would be in a position to let us use her territory either forrefuelling or as air bases. The Prime Minister suggested no special occasion,but it must be at a moment when it was in Turkey&apos;s interests to join in the grandcoalition. Meanwhile the experts were working out the necessary preparatorydetails.The Prime Minister went on to say that the war in Europe would be finishedbefore the war in the Far East. The United States Government had agreed thatthe present emphasis must be upon Germany. It might take one or two years,to finish up the Far East after Hitler was beaten. The victors would makepeace in a spirit of union and comradeship, not as they had in 1918. All problems would be discussed in a friendly spirit. There would naturally be difficulties.He hoped we should all act together to make the necessary settlement, and that russia would act with us. tie was very grateful for what Russia had clone.She would ultimately be very powerful. Germany would be completely disarmed.France is in an unhealthy condition. He hoped for a restoration of France.French territory would be more or less restored and France would have an army.Poland would also be restored and have her part to play. After the war theUnited States would be the strongest and most important nation. Their idea wasto arrange a system for preventing wars which would involve them in obligationsoutside their own territories. Therefore they were aiming at a solid internationalstructure involving the disarmament of the aggressors, international justice andso forth. This organisation would be much stronger than the former League ofNations, and would range around it all combined forces against an aggressor.Russia would be part of this organisation and had accepted the Atlantic Charter.Post-war Russia might not be the same as the Russia of former years; it mightbe even more imperialistic. But the best protection for Turkey lies in an inter-national arrangement, perhaps accompanied by special guarantees applying toher. Russia was ready to give these guarantees and possibly the United Statesalso. The Prime Minister could not say for certain, but when he had mentionedit the President of the United States had not spoken against it. The UnitedStates Constitution and the authority of the Senate made it difficult to reach animmediate decision, but the Prime Minister thought an arrangement was possible,and he was very anxious that the United States should join. They wouldcertainly join in the general security organisation.M. SARACOGLU, speaking of Turco-Russian relations, stated, that for years past Turkey had done all that wras possible to improve these relations. Hesketched the history of recent Turco-Russian relations and dwelt upon the resultof his visit to Moscow in September 1939, when the Soviet Government had refused to agree to the Anglo-Turkish Treaty and had suggested alterations.He said that as long as Turkey remained strong and intact Russia would not attack her. Nevertheless, it was possible that Russia might adopt a policy out ofharmony with her relations with the United Kingdom, and he asked what lineGreat Britain would take in that case.THE PRIME MINISTER stated that he had seen Molotov and Stalinand his impression was that both desired a peaceful and friendly association withthe United Kingdom and the United States. In the economic sphere GreatBritain and the United States had much to give to Russia and. they could helpin the reparation of Russia&apos;s losses. He could not see twenty years ahead, but wehad, nevertheless, made a treaty for twenty years. He thought Russia wouldconcentrate on reconstruction for the next ten years.   There would probably be[25031] . b 2
changes; communism had already been modified. He thought we should live in good relations with Russia and, if Great Britain and the United States actedtogether and maintained a strong air force, they should be able to ensure a periodof stability. Russia, might even gain by this. She possessed vast undevelopedareas, for instance, in Siberia. He mentioned the guarantees recently given byHis Ma;jesty&apos;s Government and the Soviet Government to Turkey in 1941 and1942 at the time of the entry into Persia and of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty.M. SARACOGLU noted that the Prime Minister had expressed the viewthat Russia would become imperialistic. This made it necessary for Turkev tobe very prudent.THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that there would be an international,organisation to secure peace and security which would be stronger than theLeague of Nations.   He was not afraid of communism.M. SARACOGLU said that he looked for something more real. All europe was full of Slavs and Communists. All the defeated countries would, becomeBolshevist and Slav if Germany was beaten.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this might be possible but things didnot always turn out as badly as was expected. But if they did so it was better that Turkey should be strong and closely associated, with the United Kingdomand the United States.Aii agreed as to the necessity of this.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would never propose to Turkey tocome into the war if she was not ready, nor would he suggest that she should do so in any way which would involve the exhaustion of her resources. Themoment would come when one push would be important, or Turkey might evenrender assistance without coining in herself, for instance, in allowing us to attackPloesti from Turkish bases.M. SARACOGLU agreed and said : &quot; Very good.&quot;THE TURKISH MINISTER. FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thought itwould probably be useless to ask the Prime Minister what the United kingdom would do if the Soviet Government did not act as he expected. For Turkey,collaboration with the Soviet Government was all right provided theycollaborated also with the United Kingdom. Turkey had always wished, and still wished, to act as a hyphen between the United &quot;Kingdom and the SovietGovernment. He wanted to know that we would not be ready to accept a Sovietfait accompli and he asked what line would be taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment if the Turkish liaison with Great Britain was affected by anySoviet action.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would support the cause of commonright against the aggressor and act in defence of common security against any power which attacked it. Dealing with the position of Germany after the war, he went on to say that there might be not an early peace but a prolonged armistice andany aggressor, such as Prussia, must be absolutely broken up. Germany might be broken up, but some structure must be left to rebuild European order and Turkeymust be part of it. There might be a moment when Turkey could strike in thewar without risk of exhaustion or invasion. He would not advise Turkey toenter the war at present, nor to do so until she is ready, but a moment might come when we should have the right to make a firm proposal to Turkey.M. MENEMENCTOGLU said that this was extremely reasonable.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the moment might come when we might ask for the passage of our aircraft through Turkey to Ploesti. Themoment was not yet. The present moment must be devoted to preparation.We should never ask Turkey to act against our common interests. She was quite free to choose when and how to act.Some discussion followed between the three Turkish representatives, after which the President defined his understanding of what had been said with regardto the suggestion for the bombardment of Ploesti.
THE PRIME MINISTER spoke of the future in regard to Russia. russia was an immense mass of people. It was impossible to foresee the future, but the.surest place for Turkey was to be a member of the Council of victors in friendlyassociation with the Soviets and with the United Kingdom and the United States.It was for Turkey to choose the moment. The Prime Minister went on to say thatour Air Force often flew ove]&apos; Switzerland to bombard Italian towns. The Swissprotested. The Germans remained unconvinced. The reason Germany did notreact against Switzerland was because it was not in her interests to attackSwitzerland. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs remarked that the geographical position of Switzerland was different.THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC stated that Turkey had askedfor equipment during the last 3-g years. The United Kingdom and the UnitedStates had decided to accelerate the supply of munitions. There had been no mention of payment. Nothing had been asked. Therefore it was clear that themain object of the United Kingdom and the United States was to make Turkeystrong, irrespective of payment.   What was the object of this?THE PRIME MINISTER stated that the object was threefold :-(i) It was important to secure the defence of Turkey against the passage ofGerman forces, although now that Germany was becoming feebler this was less important.(ii) We wished to secure the association together of the greatest number ofPowers.(iii) If the opportunity came and it did not prove to be too costly or dangerous, we wished Turkey to be able to enter Bulgaria and the Balkans and toassist in the general advance on the retreating German army. He did not ask forundertakings nor did he ask for impossibilities.THE PRESIDENT remarked that in all the Prime Minister said he saw amark of the confidence of the United Kingdom.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was certain that the arms which wewere supplying to Turkey would never be used against the Allies. We attached importance to the position of Turkey as a barrier. The Turkish representativesall confirmed this.M. MENEM EN CIOGLU observed that the Prime Minister had said thatthe fact that Turkey was in the war on the side of the victors would be one of thebest guarantees for Turkey&apos;s security. If Turkey was attached to Great Britainand had done all she could to assist the Allies, Russia would be more likely to collaborate with the Allies. In that event, the entry of Turkey into the war wouldnot change the position, though she might still enter if opportunity occurred.But, if Russia did not co-operate with the Allies, how would Turkish security beincreased if Turkey acted with the Allies?THE PRIME MINISTER said that Turkish action on our side would placeher on the side of the Great Powers and would ensure that Turkey would findherself together with the United Kingdom and the United States. Russia would inevitably join and we should all co-operate together. This would furnish an absolute guarantee that Russia would not act against Turkey. Russia had hadheavy losses and. would not be anxious for further wars. If Russia, without anycause, were to attack Turkey, the whole international organisation of which hehad already spoken would be applied on behalf of Turkey and the guaranteesafter the present war would be much more severe, not only where Turkey was concerned, but in the case of all Europe. The Prime Minister would not be a friend of Russia if she imitated Germany. If she did so, we should arrange thebest possible combination against her, and he would not hesitate to say so to Stalin.M. Molotov had asked for&apos; a Treaty by which the Baltic States should be regardedas Russian provinces. We had refused to agree to this (a) because territorialrearrangements were to be postponed for settlement after the war, and (b) because we felt it necessary to make a reservation for free determination of individuals.In place of the Treaty proposed by M. Molotov we had made a Treaty of mutual assistance for twenty years. The Soviets were very much pleased. The PrimeMinister thought they would keep their engagements. Hitherto they had neverbroken an engagement.
THE PRESIDENT laid great emphasis on the necessity for Great britain to emerge very strong after the war and less exhausted than any other Power.The safety of the world depended on this.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we were not exhausted by war. On theother hand we were strengthened by it. In all our wars we began weak but weended strong.THE PRESIDENT said that there was one point on which we could be absoulutely sure, namely, that Turkey was by no means trying to create troublebetween Great Britain and the Soviets. For a long period Turkey had been in good relations with the Soviets and so thought it was necessary to avoid doing anything to arouse Russian suspicion. The position must be looked at objectively.Turkey was more friendly with Great Britain than with the Soviets, and every-thing that had been said in the present discussion with regard to the Soviets wouldbe buried in silence and never mentioned outside this conference room. Of thatwe could be absolutely sure. Fie was talking to us absolutely confidentially. Hehad explained the reasons why he did not trust the Soviets, namely (1) The consultations with the Soviet Government at the time of the Anglo-Turkish alliance had resulted in the Soviet Government refusing to countenancethe alliance. They had stated that once Turkey had made an alliance with GreatBritain the Soviet Government had no further interest in Turkey.(2) After the fall of France the Germans had invited M. Molotov to Berlin. and the Soviets had completely changed their, attitude.^ o ^oieA&quot; (3) During M./Sai!aoog&apos;lu&apos;o visit to Merow in November 1940 a proposal had been made to the Bulgarian Government for a Treaty of Mutual assistance which would have been followed by the Soviet Government joining the tripartite Pact.Turkey had a complete understanding of British policy vis-a-vis Russia.Nevertheless they had every reason to be prudent.The Prime Minister said that the Soviet Government had signed the atlantic charter and that he felt that they were definitely desirous of having an honouredplace among the world Powers. They did not, however, interpret the atlantic charter as implying the exclusion from the Soviet of territories which wereformerly Russian.THE PRESIDENT asked whether we wished Turkey to remain strong andon her feet and not to risk her vitality or her interests.THE PRIME MINISTER said we certainly did not wish Turkey to under-take risks. We wished, her to remain strong. His Majesty&apos;s Government were ready to give a guarantee and he felt that Russia could be induced to do thesame. But. in addition to this, we wished to form an international organisation which would guarantee the security of all nations.THE PRESIDENT remarked &quot;that in theory Turkey already had. all thenecessary guarantees.THE PRIME MINISTER expressed the hope that the United States wouldassociate themselves in the great international organisation of which he had spoken. Air power in the hands of the United Kingdom and the United states would be an immense guarantee of order. The structure of the international organisation would, be based on military strength. Turkey must be included in it,and Turkey must not be exhausted, but clearly must not let herself be divorced from victory as a result of following too reserved a policy. The probability ofthe future was against quarrels among the victorious countries and in favourof understanding.THE PRIME MINISTER went on to say that there was one questionwhich he wished to ask what would be the German reaction to the present meeting ?TFIE PRESIDENT said that the answer was very simple. He would saythat Turkey was looking for arms everywhere and that now His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment were offering arms in abundance. What would the Germans have to say&apos;They could not produce arms, neither had they sufficient force to attack Turkey.In one or two months&apos; time Turkey might have sufficient arms and by that timethe situation in Russia might be stabilised.
THE PRIME MINISTER remarked that it might be stabilised, but it might also be definitely decided.THE PRESIDENT said that in that case there would be more Germanreserves for use elsewhere.   (Sic.)THE PRIME MINISTER spoke of the necessity for making a communique.He suggested that the communique should refer to discussions on the generaldefensive strength of Turkey.M. MENEMENCIOGLU suggested that the communique should containan expression of general approval of Turkish policy and mention conversations in regard to the strengthening of Turkish defensive armaments and the questionof a future international organisation for peace. It might end with a referenceto the proposal for a special guarantee.The question of the communique was left for further discussion. It wasalso agreed that more discussions should take place on the subject of the european security organisation mentioned by the Prime Minister.
THIRD MEETING.(Military.)(Saturday, January 30, 1943.)Present :General Sir Alan Brooke, Chief of theImperial General Staff.General   Sir   H.   Maitland   Wilson,Commander-in-Chief, P.A.I.C.General the Hon. Sir H. Alexander,Commander-in-Chief, Middle East.Lieut.-General  Sir  Wilfrid  Lindsell,L.G.A., Middle East.Air    Marshal    R.

C. Arnold. military attache at Ankara.Air Vice-Marshal R. A. George. AirAttache at Ankara.Commodore J. G. Dundas. Chief ofStaff to Commander-in-Chief.Mediterranean.Group Captain E. C. Hudleston.Brigadier E. I. C. Jacob.Army Equipment.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that the Prime Minister had referred to twophases of the military problem. The first was the provision of equipment forthe Turkish forces. The second was the preparation of plans for the reinforce-ment of the Turkish forces by British units. He felt that there was no need todiscuss the lists of material already supplied, en route or assigned and awaitingshipment. These were matters of the past. The question now was rather of accelerating future supplies and of seeing in what manner Great Britain could help Turkey in the training of specialists and technicians, the improvement of communications, or other means. He was not anxious to go into details at thepresent Conference, but it would be of great assistance if the Marshal would indicate those types of equipment which he placed first in order of priority.MARSHAL CAKMAK then referred to certain lists of Army equipment,and stated that the particular needs of the Turkish Army were as follows : Heavy and Light Tanks.Self-propelled artillery.Field, mountain and medium artillery (both guns and howitzers).Dual purpose A.A. and A/T guns (heavy and light) .A/T guns, 50-mm. or larger.Light machine guns.Tommv guns.Rifles/Grenades.Anti-tank mines.In addition to this list he said that the Turks had urgent requirements forcross-country motor cars, load carrying vehicles of all kinds, workshops, lorries,light and heavy, tractors, bridging equipment, and material for extendingworkshops.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that if lists could be furnished giving theactual requirements of the various classes of equipment they would be immediately examined. The Marshal would understand, of course, that muchof this equipment was still not abundant, and production both in America andin London had to be assigned to the best advantage according to the militarysituation.   Turkish requirements would, however, receive a very sympathetic
examination. He enquired whether communication difficulties would place an obstacle in the way of acceptance by the Turks of a considerable volume of equipment.MARSHAL CAKMAK said that additional rolling-stock, coal and benzinewere required to improve the capacity of the railways. &apos; Ships, too. which couldsail under the Turkish flag would also be of great value. They had no ships atpresent capable of carrying tanks.SIR WILFRID LINDSELL said that 10 locomotives and 140 wagons were almost ready for despatch to Turkey. He thought that the delivery of tankscould be carried out by rail rather than by ship.After further discussion. MARSHAL CAKMAK agreed to furnish lists of equipment already demanded but not yet supplied, and of further equipmentnow required, and to classify items in order of priority.Air Equipment.AIR MARSHAL DRUMMOND said that full requirements of the TurkishAir Force were already known.GENERAL SEFTK CAKMAK agreed, but said that up to the presentvery few aircraft had been supplied. The Turks required 500 combat aircraft,of which so far only 40 Tomahawks and 20 Hurricane II had been supplied.AIR MARSHAL DRUMMOND said that he had just received instruc-tions to provide 20 more Hurricane II and 20 Risleys. He realised that theTurks desired not only to receive aircraft for additional units, but also to rearmexisting squadrons.After further discussion it was agreed that lists of air equipment requiredby the Turkish Air Force would be supplied in a similar form to those for Armyequipment.Naval Equipment.COMMODORE DUNDAS said that Turkish Naval requirements were known, except for requirements of merchant shipping. It would be necessary toknow types and tonnage of merchant ships required so that the possibility ofsupply could be examined.It was agreed that this information would be provided.COMMODORE DUNDAS hoped that it would be possible for Turkish ships to sail to Egyptian ports as this would greatly ease the transport problem. Hethought that this would have to be a condition of supply of ships for theTurkish flag.Financial Arrangements.MARSHAL CAKMAK enquired whether the supply of equipment now-being asked for would fall under the existing British credit or under some other financial arrangements.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that he was not aware of the financial aspect, butthis could no doubt be examined by the appropriate authority.Technical A assistance.SIR ALAN BROOKE emphasised the great importance of a high standardof technical maintenance for modern equipment, and enquired what assistance theTurks would wish to have in this matter.GENERAL ARNOLD explained that assistance with driving and main-tenance schools and wireless telegraphy schools was already being given, and assistance with repair organisation was about to start. Many more technicianswould certainly be required. For example, 900 technical specialists were requiredfor an armoured division.MARSHAL CAKMAK said that he could not give an immediate answer on this point, but he thought that the provision of technicians should keep pace with the provision of material.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that, in view of the time required, for trainingtechnicians, it was essential to provide them in advance of the arrival of thematerial.   Our own experience had been that, in the early stages of the war, we[25031] c
had under-estimated the difficulties of maintenance and it had taken us a 1 one-time to catch up. He suggested that it would be very valuable if Turkish officerscould be attached to British armoured divisions and they would be able to seethe scope of the problem and we should be very glad to receive them.MARSHAL CAKMAK said that he would certainly take advantage of this offer.British Reinforcements in the Event of War.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that the second problem which the PrimeMinister had suggested for study was the reinforcement of the Turkish forces with British units in the event of Turkey being drawn into the war. What tvoeof reinforcement would be most valuable to the Turks and what strength of reinforcements would the means of communication permit? Reinforcementscould take the shape either of air squadrons or of specialist army units, or of armoured divisions. It was no use planning to send forces which would causecongestion of the L. of C. and would prevent the proper maintenance of the airforces, whose presence was essential. A plan had already been made for sending25 squadrons, together with certain anti-aircraft artillery. Airfields had beenprepared, though he believed some of these would require enlargement.GENERAL SEFIK CAKMAK said that the enlargement was in progress.He enquired whether the number of squadrons could be increased.SIR ALAN BROOKE said it might well be that the number could beincreased provided communications could be improved.MARSHAL CAKMAK suggested that the roads now under constructioncould be used for the movement of additional reinforcements.SIR WILFRID LINDSELL pointed out that the roads were not yet ready.Furthermore, the requirements of the Turkish Army and of the Turkish civilpopulation were not known. It would be necessary to make a detailed study ofthe various maintenance requirements before the size of the reinforcements couldbe fixed.MARSHAL CAKMAK enquired what would be the maximum force that could be sent if there were no transportation limitations.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that four or five regiments of anti-tank artillery and four or five regiments of anti-aircraft artillery could, be sent. Also twoarmoured divisions were available in addition to strong R.A.F. reinforcements.It was pretty certain, however, that both armoured divisions and R.A.F.squadrons could not be moved and maintained. It would be necessary to choose.The maintenance of two armoured divisions was roughly equivalent to that of45 squadrons.MARSHAL CAKMAK agreed that R.A.F. squadrons were the firstnecessity. He thought it would be advisable for two or three British officers togo as soon as possible to Ankara to make a joint study of the possibilities of theL. of C. and to examine how to increase them. He enquired whether, if such a study were made and a plan prepared, the British would be ready to send suchreinforcements as the study might show to be possible.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that this was certainly the British intention.The formations in question could be placed in convenient positions so as to be ableto move at short notice. He thought that the plan should be made in such a way as to show month by month what forces could be moved and maintained.
Right  Hon.   Winston   S.   Churchill,M.P., Prime Minister.The  Hon.   Sir  Alexander   Cadogan,Permanent Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.Sir Hughe Knatehbull-Hugessen, HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Angora.His Excellency General Ismet Inonu,President of the Turkish Republic.Flis Excellency M. Sukru Saracoglu,President of the Council of Ministers.His Excellency M. Numan Menemen-eioglu. Minister for Foreign Affairs.In reply to an enquiry by the Prime Minister. THE PRESIDENT said thathe had no particular question to put arising out of the previous day&apos;s eonversa-tions. He hoped that the Prime Minister would leave Turkey content with what had been achieved.THE PRIME MINISTER said that since their last meeting he had prepared a paper,* of which he would give the President a copy, clarifying his views. he emphasised that he had not of course been able to consult his Government upon this and it only represented his personal ideas.His conception was that there were three possible stages. First, the reinforcement of Turkey. Secondly, we could hope that in some months timethe enemy would be considerably weaker whereas Turkey would have added to her own strength, tie therefore hoped that Turkey might then be in a position to interpret rather more liberally her obligations of neutrality. It was of course for the Turkish Government to consider this matter and to make their owndecision. What he had in mind was that Turkey might for instance give facilities for British and American aircraft to bomb the Rumanian airfields fromTurkish bases. Again, if we embarked on operations against the Dodecanese,Turkey might give us assistance there. Or again, she might assist by opening theStraits to the Allies whilst keeping them closed against the Axis. Such steps would not amount to entering into the war and it might be that Germany wouldchoose to ignore them as she did when the United States resorted to a number ofstrictly un-neutral acts during the period before she became a belligerent.Before running risks by embarking on such actions Turkey could ask forguarantees.The third stage would be the full entry of Turkey into the war.THE PRIME MINISTER emphasised that he was not asking Turkey togive any engagement, but it was well to face these possibilities and to be preparedfor all eventualities.THE PRIME MINISTER then read to the President the telegram whichhe had sent to M. Stalin on the 24th November, 1942, regarding the Turkishsituation, together with M. Stalin&apos;s reply. He stressed that these were privatemessages and begged the President that they should not go any further; hecommunicated them in order to show his complete confidence in the president and to let the latter see exactly what had been in his mind. THE PRIMEMINISTER observed that if Turkey wished to improve her relations with SovietRussia, now was the time to make the attempt.THE PRIME MINISTER then gave the President the paper which he had written and the President read it through.When he had finished reading the document THE PRESIDENT said thatJt had made a very good impression on him and that in general he agreed withall of it. It was difficult on first reading to appreciate all the points and differenteventualities which it contemplated, but he had noted with gratification that it took good account of Turkey;s particular point of view. If the Prime Ministersconfidence in him were maintained, and if they could consult as the situationdeveloped, all would be well.   There would be a period of crisis during which[250311FOURTH MEETING.(Political.)(11-30 a.m., Sunday, January 31, 1943.)Present:
Turkey must be reinforced, lasting perhaps four or five months, and during thattime the Turkish Government would watch the situation closely. The documentcontained many solid points relating to the future. The President thought thatif Europe could be organised on the lines indicated that would be ideal.THE, PRIME MINISTER observed that there were three main belligerentsin the European theatre, though of course there were other refugee AlliedGovernments who also contributed what they could. If Turkey voluntarilyentered the war she would make the fourth armed Power. This would be a greatopportunity for Turkey to take her due place and to come to the Peace Conferencerelatively unweakened, one of the four victorious Powers. That afforded the best,prospects for her security.THE PRESIDENT said that he was in entire agreement with this lineof thought.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was his intention to telegraph the-substance of this document to President Roosevelt, who would no doubt give his views direct to President Inonu. He would also give a general account of these conversations to M. Stalin. He suggested that the President, if questioned bythe Germans, should say that Turkey had given no engagement to the BritishGovernment as the latter had not asked for any. He himself would speaksimilarly in Parliament.THE PRESIDENT said that by handling the matter in this way thePrime Minister would obtain everything that he desired.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would of course never ask turkey to rush into a disaster, for that would be equally a disaster for ourselves.M. SARACOGLU said that his Government had always wished to see aBritish victory, and they had helped within the limits of their abilities. Theyhad. for instance, as the Ambassador could confirm, constantly passed on information. They would of course continue to help in that way, but he couldnot at the moment say whether they would be able to go so far as to take theaction suggested in regard to the Straits.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in any event he did not wish to askTurkey to run any undue risk. He repeated that he would communicate this document to President Roosevelt. The Soviet Government had a great respect for the United States, from whom they were receiving considerable assistance in military and other material.THE PRESIDENT asked about Soviet-Japanese relations, to which thePRIME MINISTER replied that in his view the Soviet Government would wantnot to be out of it when the time came for finishing off Japan.THE PRESIDENT asked whether M. Stalin had made any promises to that effect.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had never asked M. Stalin to doso, although the latter had made statements in conversation which justified thePrime Ministers hope.THE PRIME MINISTER, referring to his earlier suggestion for actionregarding the Straits, pointed out that as a matter of fact this particular action was rather distinct from the others which he had suggested, as it would be of no effect for shipping until air supremacy had been won in the l^egion of the Straits.THE PRESIDENT said that if Germany was still strong enough she wouldtake counter measures against any infraction of neutrality. If Germany sought to impose a policy on Turkey, then Turkey, even to-day, would offer resistance.It was possible that the Germans would raise objection to Turkey accepting arms from the United Nations but in that event he would reply that Turkey had everyright to do this. If a German attack came, the question would, be quite simpleand Turkey would, of course, resist.If Turkey took the un-neutral action suggested it might be that germany would not react and then it would be for Turkey to take her own decisions.Turkey must first increase her strength.   As the situation of the Axis worsened,and as&quot; it became better for the Allies, he quite saw that there were various stages&apos;which could be contemplated.
M. SARACOGLU said that that was the key to the matter, that the decisionsmust be lett to the Turkish Government.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed. He asked the President to consider theSpanish situation. Spam was, militarily speaking, very weak. Gibraltar was of great importance to us, and, in fact, vital to our recent operations in north africa, but Germany had lately lost ground in Spain, and although we did manythings m Gibraltar in connection with that operation that might have compromise-misecl the neutrality of Spam, which would no doubt have been resented to theutmost by the Germans, nevertheless nothing happened at all., The Turkish position was very different from what it was a year aeo butTHE PRIME MINISTER added again that Great Britain wllT neverencourage turkey to any imprudence, as the last thing we wished was to seeTurkey involved in disaster.THE PRESIDENT said that if the Prime Minister would put complete confidence m him everything would be all right,        -
FIFTH MEETING.(Military.)(11-45 a.m., Sunday, January 31, 1943.)Present :General Sir Alan Brooke, Chief of theImperial General Staff.General   Sir   H.   Maitland   Wilson,Commander-in-Chief, P.A.EC.General the Hon Sir H. Alexander,Commander-in-Chief, Middle East.Lieut.-General Sir Wilfrid Lindsell,L.G.A., Middle East.Air Marshal R. M.

Dundas, Chief ofStaff to Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean.Group Captain E. C. Huclleston.Brigadier E. I. C. Jacob.Self-propelled artillery.SIR ALAN BROOKE informed Marshal Cakinak that 12 self-propelled25-pdrs. would be provided at once from the Middle East and would be followedby others up to a total of 48.MARSHAL CAKMAK expressed his acknowledgment of this offer.Employment of Turkish ferries.SIR ALAN BROOKE said that he understood a number of special ferrieswhich had been manufactured and supplied to the Turks were now in theBosphorous and were not fully employed. He suggested that these ferries wouldbe of great value for the conveyance of war material from Egyptian ports to turkey.MARSEIAL CAKMAK said that these ferries were held for a particularpurpose, and&apos;if they were used to transport material they would not be available if an emergency arose. He undertook, however, to examine the possibility ofmaking; use of them in the manner suggested.Supply of captured war material. -SIR ALAN BROOKE said that a considerable amount of German andItalian war material had been captured in Libya and the British were preparedto supply anything the Turks might require from this source. If the Turks hadin their possession German or Italian equipment it might well be that valuablereplacements or additions might come from this captured material.MARSHAL CAKMAK undertook to include in the list of equipment required by the Turkish Army a special list of German or Italian material, whichcould then be examined by the British.Statement of agreed conclusions.SIR ALAN BROOKE then handed to the Marshal copies of a translation of draft conclusions, which had been drawn up in the light of the discussion at theprevious meeting.* In the course of discussion certain amendments were suggested and agreed to.* Here recorded as Third Meeting.Marshal Fevzi Cakmak, Chief of the.General Staff.M. Feridun Erkin, Minister Plenipotentiaire-tentiary, Assistant Secretary-General, Ministry for ForeignAffairs.General Sefik Cakmak, Air Adviser ofthe Turkish General Staff.Colonel Fasih Kayabali, Chief of theOperations Section of the GeneralStaff.
AIR MARSHAL DRUMMOND enquired whether R.A.F. staff officers could now be sent to Turkey to complete operational plans for the employment of R.A.F.squadrons, which would go to the assistance of Turkey in the event of war. Suchplans would cover the allocation of airfields, the system of signal communicationarid of radio location and air raid warning.MARSHAL OAKMAK accepted this proposal, and an addition to theconclusion in this sense was accordingly drafted.It was further agreed that the lists of war material required by the Turksshould be handed as soon as possible to the British Service Attaches forforwarding to the British military authorities.The conclusions were then finally agreed, the British text being accepted asthe official version.*SIR ALAN BROOKE said that he was very glad to have had this opportunity of discussion with the Marshal. In the past we had been ourselvesshort of equipment and had not been able to do as much as we should have likedfor the Turkish Army. The situation was now much improved, and he hopedthat we would be able to make the Turks so strong that they would not be attacked.MARSHAL CAKMAK said that he, too, rejoiced at the opportunity whichhad arisen of meeting and of setting on foot joint plans. He regarded it as asymbol of the friendship existing between the two nations.
ANNEX (1).1. The danger to Turkey on her Northern fiank has been removed for thetime being by the shattering victories of the Russians over the Germans, and on her Southern flank by the fact that Generals Alexander and Montgomery havechased Rommel 1,600 miles away from Cairo with the destruction of three-quarters of his army and nine-tenths of his equipment. There remains, however the Germans&apos; need of oil and of the &quot; Drang nach Osten,&quot; and they may in the summer try to force their way through the centre. Turkey must be in the best possible condition to resist any such act of aggression by force of arms. We have come here to lind out how we can best help our Ally at this serious but at thesame time hopeful juncture. To this end we are prepared to speed up and increase the supply of the modern munitions which the Turkish Army unhappilylacks. The President of the United States has asked me to handle this matter for him as well as for my own country. This of course does not mean that I candraw a blank cheque on the United States, and I shall have to refer back on particular points. However, the President was most anxious this meeting shouldtake place, as he is desirous that Turkey should be safe and strong, and that she should be closely associated with the two great Western Democracies not onlyduring the concluding stages of the war, but in the general work of worldrehabilitation which will follow. I think therefore we may expect mostsympathetic consideration for anything we recommend.2. In what directions can we increase the flow and speed up the efficient useof the weapons we supply ? What is the present state of the communications and what measures should be taken to reduce any congestion on them ? what measures should be taken to make sure that the equipment is properly handled by our Ally \ We have ourselves no false pride on these points and think only of getting stronger and better equipped. For instance, the Americans have sent out teachers to train us in the use of their various tanks and weapons they havesupplied to us in the Middle East. They even sent out a large number of skilledengineers in plain clothes before they came into the war in order to teach ushow to keep the machines in running order and how to make repairs. Anotherinstance is the railway through Persia. We thought we were running it very well, but the Americans made a number of criticisms and offered to take it overwith larger strength and help us to run it better. They are now taking over from us section by section. I say this to show that we are not making anyderogatory suggestion in asking that at once a considerable number of expertsand technicians in plain clothes should come in to assist in the working up ofthe material so that it can get into the hands of the troops and be kept in good condition. Also, we are very ready to send officers with the latest experience intank warfare and other branches of technical warfare and to give all possible information that could be desired. I have been particularly distressed at thespectacle of the Turkish Army, which has the finest infantry and a good fieldartillery, but has not been able to. get during the whole 3-J- years-of this Avar the modern equipment which is decisive on the battlefield and which the Germans,from their looted stores, have been able to give, for instance, to the Bulgarians.This has made me fully comprehend the attitude of Turkey at every stage we havetravelled so far. The time has come when these disparities can and must beremoved with the greatest speed.3. The first stage in my proposals for assisting Turkey to prepare her own defence, of course, must be subjected to detailed examination and re-statement by the high military experts gathered together here.4. The second, phase of the discussions must contemplate the hypothesis that Turkey has been drawn into the war, either by German aggression or by astate of anarchy in Bulgaria and the Balkans, needing the Turkish Governmentto intervene to protect its own interests. In whatever way this state of war may arise, Turkey must be able to meet it effectively, and, moreover, must be able totake her steps with perfect freedom in the meanwhile and with the sense of security which comes from strength and modern arms. This phase must beconsidered under two heads :  The first: the immediate emergency, including the hostile initial air attack.What can we arrange to have ready for such an emergency in April, May. JunPJuly respectively ?
The second heading of this second phase is :  What aid should we send in the event of Turkey being drawn into war, and how soon can it get there? There is first of all our Air Support. The Britishand Americans will certainly send together immediately on the event being known,at least 25 squadrons. A number of airfields have already been prepared and aoood deal of material is already on the sites. However, there is a second series,of airfields, the preparation of which was discontinued about a year ago, the:construction of which should be actively proceeded with. Material, spare parts and field workshops must all be put in place. The nests must be made so that thebirds can fly there at once. Unless the nests are ready birds cannot live and cannotstrike. This work, which is really vital to the defence of Turkey, should be pushed forward with frantic energy, and British and American Engineers and Air force officers volunteer their services to any extent that may be needed. The moment the Staff arrangements have been made, not a day should be lost.5. It is not possible for the Turkish Army fully to equip itself with all the-technical weapons should the emergency arise in the early Summer of this year.The British could make available certain special units which are already fullytrained, which do not involve the movement of great masses of men across the communications, but which are essential to the holding of the airfields and alsothe repulse of tank attacks. To this end we will hold ready at convenient places,,with such. American assistance as we may need and can obtain, as many regiments-of anti-tank artillery as can be conveniently received, including some of our verylatest 17-pounders, which have never yet been in action. We will also have readya number of regiments of anti-aircraft artillery to reinforce the forces which willalready have been moved into position. We will also prepare to move two battle-experienced armoured divisions in at the earliest moment. In addition to this,there will be the Ninth and Tenth Armies. We are drawing somewhat upon the tenth Army for future operations in the Central Mediterranean, but the PolishCorps, which is three-quarters equipped and is of very high-class personnel, wouldbe available unless the Russian Caucasian front should break and the Germansbe found advancing towards Persia.. This is not at all likely. Besides this, the ninth Army in Syria is being built up to perhaps five divisions. It is felt,however, that the movement of these masses might congest the communications and that it is far better in the first instance to push the specialised units throughwith the maximum celerity. The whole of this problem must be studied byMarshal Cakmak and General Brooke and Air Marshal Drummond, together withGeneral Wilson, who is soon going to Command in the Middle East and who willbe charged with the responsibility of feeding up to the Turkish frontier or intoTurkey the material and other reinforcements or forms of assistance that maybe desirable. This is a second phase in two parts upon which our military expertsmust sit in conference. If there is not time in a single day for the high officers to cover the ground they should not hesitate to stay a second day after I, myself,will have started my homeward journey. This would enable the whole matter to be settled on a high level in a form where the further studies can be remitted to the Staff Officers for the most detailed and careful thrashing out.6. I will now tell you about the Casablanca Conference and the greatconcentration of forces we have decided to make in the Central Mediterranean.,Naturally, we cannot give details about the exact plans and dates, but our intention is to destroy Italy; shatter her entirely; beat her out of the war, bothby terrific bombing from Tunis and from Great Britain and by heavy attacks overthe sea, for which great preparations are required and are being made. The&apos;breaking down of Italy would lead to contact with the Western Balkans andwith the highly hopeful resistance maintained both by General Michailovitch inCroatia and the Partisans in Croatia and Slovenia. According to our expecta-tions and reasonable hopes, we shall drive the enemy from the coasts of Africainto the sea before the Summer and perhaps much earlier. In that event the summer months will see in the Mediterranean the largest operations it is in thepower of Great Britain and United States to conduct. These operations, and above all the Italian attitude, will cause the very greatest agitation throughoutthe Balkans. The further advance of the Russian Armies cannot be excluded.Operations across the Black Sea must be considered a possibility with theirsuperior fleet. It is therefore in the Summer that we must consider the crisistemperature will rise very high and the need for Turkey to be secure will be;paramount.[25031]D
is. I know that Premier Stalin is most anxious to see Turkey well armed and ready to defend herself against aggression. I know it is president roosevelt&apos;s wish, as it is certainly that of His Majesty&apos;s Government, that turkey should be a full partner in the Peace Conference, where all questions of changes in the existing status quo will have to be settled. It is not possible tosay when this world war will end. We British and Americans are quite sure that we shall win. That is why the President has called the CasablancaConference the &quot; Unconditional Surrender Conference.&quot; It must be rememberedthat we were peaceful nations who had made very little preparation for the war.But we are now becoming warlike nations with -far greater resources of men and munitions than the Germans and Japanese, to say nothing of the Italians, for it is kinder to say nothing of them, can produce. We are absolutely resolved togo on to the end and make a good job of it this time. You probably know as wellas we. and perhaps even better, what is the interior state of Germany. We arenot counting on an early or sudden collapse, but, of course, no one can be sure that it will not come suddenly as it did last time. We must be ready, both forthe worst and for the best.8. I have not been in Turkey since 1909. when I met many of the brave menwho laid the foundations of the modern Turkey. There is a long story of the friendly relations between Great Britain and Turkey. Across it is a* terribleslash of the last war. when German intrigues and British and Turkish mistakesled to our being on opposite sides. We fought as brave and honourable opponents.But those days are done, and we and our American allies are prepared to makevigorous exertions in order that we shall all be together and continue together tomove forward into a world arrangement in which peaceful peoples will have aright to be let alone and in which all peoples will have a chance to help one another.ANNEX (2).NOTE ON POST-WAR SECURITY.1. When the United Nations, led by the three Great Powers Great Britain,United States and the U.S.S.R., have received the unconditional surrender ofGermany and Italy, Great Britain and the United States will turn their fullforce against Japan in order to punish effectively that greedy and ambitiousnation for its treacherous assaults and outrages, and to procure likewise from japan unconditional surrender.2. In this, although no Treaty arrangement has been made, it seems probablethat Great Britain and the United States will be joined by Russia.3. The Peace Conference of the victorious. Bowers will probably assemblein Europe wdiile the final stages of the war against Japan are still in progress.At this Conference the defeated aggressor countries will receive the directions of the victors. The object of these directions will be to prevent as effectively aspossible the renewal of acts of aggression of the kind which have caused thesetwo terrible wars in Europe, in one generation. For this purpose, and so far aspossible, the total disarmament of the guilty nations will be enforced. On theother hand, no attempt will be made to destroy their peoples or to prevent them from gaining their living and leading a decent life in spite of all the crimes theyhave committed.4. It is recognised that it is not possible to make the vanquished pay forthe war as was tided last time and consequently the task of rebuilding ruinedand starving Europe will demand from the conquerors a. period of exertionscarcely less severe than that of the war. Russia particularly, which has sufferedsuch horrible devastation, will be aided in every possible way in her wrork of restoring the economic life of her people. It seems probable that economicreconstruction and rehabilitation will occupy the full energies of all countries fora good many years in view of their previous experiences and the lessons theyhave learnt.5. Russia has signed a Treaty with Great Britain on the basis of the atlantic Charter binding both nations mutually to aid each other. The duration of this Treaty is twenty years.   By it, and by the Atlantic Charter, the two
nations renounce all idea of territorial gains. The Russians no doubt interpretthis as giving them the right to claim, subject to their agreement with Poland,their frontiers of June 1941 before they were attacked by Germany.6. It is the intention of the Chiefs of the United Nations to create a world organisation for the preservation of peace, based upon conceptions of freedomand justice and the revival of prosperity. As a part of this organisation an instrument of European Government will be established which will embodythe spirit but not be subject to the weaknesses of the former League of Nations,The units forming this body will not only be the great nations of Europe andAsia Minor as long established, but a number of Confederations formed amongthe smaller States, among which a Scandinavian. Bloc, a Danubian Bloc,- and aBalkan Bloc appear to be obvious. A similar instrument will be formed in theFar East with different membership, and the whole will be held together by thefact that the victorious Powers intend to continue fully armed, especially in theair, while imposing complete disarmament upon the guilty. No one can predictwith certainty that the victors will never quarrel among themselves, or fhatthe United States may not once again retire from Europe, but after theexperiences which all have gone through, and their sufferings, and the certainty that the third struggle will destroy all that is left of the culture, wealth andcivilisation of mankind and1 reduce us to the level almost of wild beasts, themost intense effort will be made by the leading Powers to prolong their honour-able association, and by sacrifice and self-restraint win for themselves a gloriousname in human annals. Great Britain will certainly do her utmost to organisea coalition resistance to any act of aggression committed by any Power, andit is believed that the United States will co-operate with her, and even possiblytake the lead of the world, on account of her numbers and strength, in the goodwork of preventing such tendencies to aggression before they break into open war.7. The highest security for Turkey in the post-war world will be found by her taking her.place as a victorious belligerent and ally at the side of GreatBritain, the United States and Russia. In this way a start will be made inall friendship and confidence, and the new instrument will grow around the goodwill and comradeship of those who have been in the field together withpowerful armies.8. Turkey may be drawn into the war either by being attacked in thedespairing convulsions of the still very powerful Nazi power, or because herinterests require her to intervene to help prevent total anarchy in the Balkans,and also because the sentiments of modern Turkey are in harmony with thelarge generous conceptions embodied in the Atlantic Charter which are goingto be fought for and defended by new generations of men.9. We must, therefore, consider the case of Turkey becoming a belligerent.The military and technical side is under examination by Marshal Chakmak,Generals Brooke, Alexander and Wilson, and other high technical authorities.The political aspect is no less important. It would be wrong for Turkey toenter the war, unless herself attacked, if that only led her to a disaster, and&quot; herally Britain, has never asked, and will never ask, her to do so under suchconditions. On the other hand, if the general defensive strength of Turkey is raised! by the measures now being taken, and also by the increasing weakness of Nazi Germany, or their withdrawal to a greater distance, or by great divisionstaking place in Bulgaria, or by bitter quarrel between the Roumanians andHungarians over Transylvania, or through the internal resistance to the Germanand Italian tyranny shown by Yugoslavia and Greece -for any or all of these reasons and causes Turkey should play a part and win her place in the councils of the victors.10. In the first instance it is possible that the military situation might be such that Turkey would feel justified in taking the same extended view of neutrality or non-belligerency as characterised the attitude of the United Statestowards Great Britain before the United States was drawn into the war. Inthis connection, the destruction of the Roumanian Oilfields by air attacks byBritish and American aircraft operating from Turkish airfields, or refuellingthere, would have far-reaching consequences and might, in view of the oil scarcityin Germany, appreciably shorten the struggle. In the same way, also, the avail-ability of air bases, or refuelling points, in Turkey would be of great assistanceto Great Britain in her necessary attack on the Dodecanese, and later upon Crete,for which in any case, whether we get the help or not, General Wilson has been[25031] E
directed to prepare during the present year. There is also the immenselyimportant question of the opening of the Straits to Allied and their closing toAxis traffic. The case contemplated in this paragraph is one in , which turkey would have departed from strict impartial neutrality and definitely have takensides with the United Nations, without, however, engaging her armies offensivelyagainst the Germans and the JBulgars,, and those nations would put up with this action on the part of Turkey because they would not wish to excite her more active hostility.11. However, we cannot survey this field without facing the possibility ofTurkey becoming a full belligerent, and of her armies advancing into the Balkansside by side with the Russians on the one hand, in the North, and the British to the southward. In the event of Turkey becoming thus directly , involved eitheroffensively or through being attacked in consequence of her attitude, she would receive the utmost aid from all her allies and, in addition, it would be right forher, before incurring additional risks, to seek precise guarantees as to her territory and rights after the war. Great Britain would be willing to give theseguarantees in a Treaty at any time quite independently of any other Power. Sheis also willing to join with Russia in giving such guarantees, and it is believedthat Russia would be willing to make a Treaty to cover the case of Turkeybecoming a full, belligerent, either independently or in conjunction with GreatBritain. It seems certain to Mr. Churchill that President Roosevelt would gladlyassociate himself with such Treaties and that the whole weight of the UnitedStates would be used in the Peace Settlement to that end. At the same time, one must not ignore the difficulties which the United States Constitution interposesagainst prolonged European commitments. These Treaties and assurances would naturally fall within the ambit of the world Instrument to protect all countries from wrong-doers which it is our main intention and inflexible resolve to createshould God give us the power and lay this high duty upon us.31.1.43.. - ANNEX (3). .AGREED CONCLUSIONS OF THE ANGLO-TURKISH MILITARYCONFERENCES HELD AT AD ANA ON JANUARY 30AND 31. 1943.IT is agreed  -I. That the Turkish Military Representatives will furnish the british military Representatives with lists of the Naval, Military and Air equipment required by the Turkish&apos;Forces.   These lists will show :(i) Equipment already demanded but not yet delivered;0? &apos;&apos;  1 &quot; (ii) New requests; ;/and will indicate for each class of equipment the order of priority to be attachedto each item. These lists will be examined by the British with a view tosupplying as quickly as possible such equipment as can,be made available.ID That the British authorities will examine the possibility of supplyingmerchant vessels Tor&apos; transfer to the Turkish flag. These vessels would be usedto convey munitions and other, supplies from Egyptian ports to Turkey. TheTurkish authorities will furnish a statement of the type and tonnage of shipsrequired.III. That in view of the urgent necessity of increasing the power of theTurkish1 military authorities to receive modern equipment, the Turkish GeneralStaff will prepare a scheme for the reception, utilisation and maintenance of suchequipment. This scheme will be implemented in conjunction with G.H.Q.,Middle East. The British military authorities will also undertake to trainTurkish personnel in British schools and to receive Turkish officers and men, forattachment to Armoured Divisions and other specialised units, and will submit proposals to the Turkish- General Staff. All these matters will be the subject of direct discussion between the Turkish General Staff and the British service attaches at Ankara.
jV. That British Staff Officers will proceed forthwith to Ankara toundertake, in collaboration with the Turkish General Staff, a study of the formand quantity of support which transportation facilities will enable the British tosend to Turkey in. the event of the latter being drawn into the war. The Termsof Reference of this study will be as follows :  The British and Turkish Staffs will prepare a plan for the movement and subsequent maintenance of British forces into Turkey in the event of Turkeybeing drawn into the war. The plan should show for each month in 1943 the size and nature of these forces. In order to draw up this plan, the following factswill need to be established : (i) the present capacity of the ports, railways and roads available for the move of the forces, having regard to the requirements of the Turkisharmed forces and of the civil population;(ii) the increase in this available capacity which could be secured by a programme of development of the means of communication, thedumping of supplies, the construction and improvement of airfields and the provision of technical assistance and material;(iii) assuming that the programme in (ii) above is carried out, the resultantavailable capacity, month by month, throughout the year;(iv) given the resultant capacity, the composition of the land and air forces to be provided.V. That the above plan, when made, will be kept continually up to date.VI. That since the air plans for the support of Turkey are relatively well advanced, British Staff Officers should proceed as soon as possible to Ankara tocomplete, in consultation with the Turkish General Staff, the joint operationalplan.Adana, January 31, 1943.
