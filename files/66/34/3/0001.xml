THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERMMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 53.February 4. 1943.WAR CABINET.MALTA.EVACUATION OF CIVILIANS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN June 1942 the^Wa r Cabinet decided that the process of evacuatingcivilians from Malta should &quot;eease; save for very special cases which could bejustified on grounds of benefit to the war effort (W.M. (42) 83rd Conclusions).On the 3rd November. 1942. the &quot;War Cabinet confirmed the previous ruling forthe time being (W.M. (42) 149th Conclusions). On both occasions the governor of Malta had proposed that evacuation should be made compulsory for the families of British Service personnel in Malta.2. Since his arrival in this country Lord Gort has urged very strongly the reopening of the question. I give in an appendix some typical examples ofthe persons he wishes to evacuate. Such people are constantly agitating to be evacuated. They are a source of discontent among the Services and Britishresidents in Malta, and an embarrassment to the Service and Civil authorities.None of them are capable of rendering useful public service.3. Since this question was before the Cabinet in November conditions in malta, have been transformed by the successful campaign in Libya, by theoccupation of French North Africa and above all by the safe arrival of severalconvoys bearing food supplies which have permitted a considerable increase in public rations. These events have had a marked effect in restoring confidence in Malta, and I am satisfied that the gradual removal of those British residentswho wish to leave can now be effected without risk of untoward political reactions,among the Maltese.I do not suggest that any formal measure of discrimination should beintroduced in this matter in favour of British as contrasted with Maltese people.It would, for example, be impolitic to make the families of British service personnel liable to compulsory evacuation or to deny all facilities to Maltesewho wish to be evacuated from Malta. But these stipulations should cause noembarrassment. It is improbable that any considerable number of Maltese will wish to be evacuated from Malta (i.e., to leave the Colony for an indefinite period,probably at least for the duration of the war), and of those who do, few willhave claims to early priority as compared with the British residents. On theother hand, most of the British residents whom the Governor wishes to evacuatewill be glad to go, if transport facilities can be made available.4. Air transport is likely to provide for some time to come the only means;of evacuating civilians, most of whom will be women and children. The Secretaryof State for Air has agreed to the use of air transport subject to the following-conditions : (a) that accommodation is only provided when there are no passengers orfreight of more importance to the war effort awaiting transport by air;(b) that there is no obligation on the Air services to bring civilian evacueesbeyond Gibraltar;   they must be prepared, in view of the heavy demands on air capacity between Gibraltar and this country, tocontinue their journey from Gibraltar by sea if necessary;[25005]Copy No.
(c)&apos;that the Captains of aircraft are hot asked to alter their flight plan(e.g., routes and height to be flown) out of consideration for the welfare of young and infirm;(d) that no request is made for the aircraft to be modified so as to providespecial comfort or amenities.(e) that these civilians are not evacuated via the Middle East and WestAfrica. If they go to the Middle East they will have to continue theirjourney via the Cape.I am prepared to accept these conditions. The rate of evacuation will thusdepend upon the volume of important war traffic. It will not in any case berapid, but I understand that about half.a dozen passengers might be brought from Malta each week. Even at this rate evacuation over a period would providematerial relief. But the Governor should be warned that any opportunity of evacuation by sea must be taken, despite the possibility that air passages mightbe forthcoming in the near future.5. It is not my intention that any public announcement should be issued.Persons who desire to be evacuated from Malta evidently make their wishesknown already, and the medical authorities notify cases in which evacuation is recommended on health grounds.I ask my colleagues to approve the following recommendation, in which theFirst Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretaries of State for War and Airconcur :  That, subject to the conditions stated above, the Governor should beallowed to arrange for the evacuation of civilians, whether British or Maltese,from Malta as opportunity may offer, the allocation of passages being left tohis discretion.0.
