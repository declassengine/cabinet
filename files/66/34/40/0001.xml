THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1943.SECRET / Copy No,    3 3W.P. (43) 90.March 2, 1943.WAR CABINET.THE WORK OF THE B.B.C.Note by the Minister of Information.I circulate herewith, for the information of my colleagues, a short memo-randum by Mr. Robert Foot, Joint Director-General of the B.B.C., showing themain developments in its organisation since the war began.B. B.March 2, 1943.B.B.C. ORGANISATION IN 1939 AND AT THE PRESENT TIME.1. The B.B.C.&apos;s primary function up to September 1939 was to carry on abroadcasting service for the benefit of wireless licence holders in the UnitedKingdom, from whom its income was derived. Its secondary function was to broadcast to British listeners in the Empire. It had, since the previous year,assumed, at the request of the Government, the additional function of providing a limited service of broadcasts in certain foreign languages. Since the outbreakof war it has, at the call of the Government, equipped itself to carry on a vastlyincreased service of broadcasts directed outwards from this country and addressedto most of the nations of the world; the greater part of the organisation-is nowdirected to this end. Thus, the main difference between the present organisationand the organisation in 1939 is that, whereas in 1939 it was predominantly aHome broadcasting organisation, it is now, in terms of volume of output, pre-dominantly an Overseas broadcasting organisation.2. The first steps towards putting the B.B.C. on to a war-time footing were taken at the beginning of 1938. At that time the first programmes in foreignlanguages were inaugurated; plans were set on foot for the continuance of the broadcasting service in case of war; and the B.B.C. began, in consultation withthe Home Office, the kind of systematic publicising and explanation of A.R.P.precautions which has, in war time, been extended to cover all the main aspectsof Home Front activities.   The Munich crisis accelerated war preparations.3. Apart, however, from the recruitment of a relatively small number offoreign staff, these preliminary steps had no marked effect on the generalorganisation of the B.B.C., which continued up to the outbreak of war to bedirected primarily to the expansion and improvement of the Home broadcastingservice. Ten programme departments and six Regional organisations wereconcentrating during the pre-war years on the production of various types ofbroadcast in the National and Regional programmes for United Kingdom listeners(the number of wireless licences continued to mount year by year). An additionaldepartment had been formed in 1936 to produce programmes from the new London[25106]
Television Station at Alexandra Palace. Important additions were made to the network of transmitters for the Home services right up to the outbreak of war andgreat advances were being made in the technical development of the televisiontransmissions. The production of programmes in the Empire Service continuedto be the concern of a single department which took into its scope the. small number of foreign language programmes as they were introduced.4. On the 1st September, 1939, the B.B.C. changed over to war conditions.An entirely different system of transmission was immediately introduced (with theobject of withholding assistance from enemy aircraft) and this had the effect of reducing Home broadcasting to a single programme in the place of eight. the television Service was discontinued. Increased coverage, on the other hand, was provided for the overseas programmes, which were organised into two maindivisions, the World Programme and the European Programme. Additionalforeign language units were speedily created. The Monitoring Service was established, at Government request, to ascertain and report the content of radiotransmissions from abroad.5. Since the beginning of the war, accessions of transmitter strength havemade it possible to increase progressively the number of foreign language services,involving continued expansion of the European and Overseas broadcasting organisations within the B.B.C. On the Home side, the severe wartime curtail-ment of programmes was soon mitigated by the introduction, early in 1940, of theProgramme for the Forces, which rapidly established itself as a much-neededsecond programme for United Kingdom listeners. Although the choice of alter-native programmes remained restricted, the hours during which Home broad-casting was carried on were actually increased to meet wartime needs from13 hours 45 minutes to 17 hours 45 minutes a day. The Regional organisations(North of England, Midlands, West of England, Scotland, Wales and NorthernIreland), which in peace-time provided material for their own Regional Pro-grammes, have remained in being and fulfil the important task of contributingprogramme material from different parts of the British Isles to Elome and overseas services alike.6. In September 1939, 63 news bulletins were being directed overseas each week in English, and 92 in foreign languages. 149 bulletins are now- broadcasteach week in English and 771 in foreign languages. The ten languages in use in1939 have increased to 46 at the present time.&apos; The hours of broadcasting inforeign languages has increased during the same period from 43 hours to 291hours in each week. The Empire Service transmissions have increased from129 hours to 223 hours. The overseas services are still being expanded in accord-ance with a well-defined policy agreed with the Government.7. The number of staff employed by the Corporation has risen since september 1939 from 4,300 to over 11,000. Revenue expenditure in September1939, excluding income-tax and depreciation, was at the rate of  3,500.000. Theestimated revenue expenditure for 1942/43 is  7,500,000.Machinery for output of news.8. The B.B.C. machinery is, up to a point, analogous with that of any news-paper. The B.B.C. uses news agency material; sends out correspondents; receivesguidance from the Ministry of Information at press conferences andi through the notes issued to editors; and submits material to censorship under the ordinarycensorship rules. The machinery is, however, more complicated than that of a newspaper for several reasons. Successive news bulletins follow each other atrapid intervals all round the clock and involve the preparation by the news editorsof a continuous series of new editions of the news by day and night. In additionto the usual editorial news staff, it is necessary to employ special staffs of newsreaders, translators and language supervisors, and technical staff for the handling of the equipment for making sound recordings.9. Further special machinery has been adopted in order to maintain a high standard of accuracy and to safeguard the reputation of British broadcasts as a source of authoritative news, e.g.: (i) All news items concerning war operations are referred, after censorship,to the Government and Service Departments concerned in each case,so as to provide an additional and more elaborate check on accuracyand &quot; slant &quot; ;
(ii) The Controller of the B.B.C.&apos;s News Division attends daily at theMinistry of Information^ Standing Conference;(iii) The Controller of the European Division has a special status in thehigh ranks of the Political Warfare Executive.10. Government Publicity. The machinery for handling the broadcastingside of Government publicity campaigns is well established. The various B.B.C.departments concerned with programme output, whether in the form of news,talks, features, plays or light entertainment, are all available to play their part,and the necessary liaison arrangements have been established between the B.B.C.and the Campaigns Division of the Ministry of Information in order to ensureco-ordination and planning. Some 180 separate broadcasts are devoted every week in the Home services to special aspects of Government publicity.ROBERT FOOT,Joint Director-General, B.B.C.
