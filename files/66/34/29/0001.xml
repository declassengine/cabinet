THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 79.February 22, 1943.WAR CABINET.NORTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues a record of a conversation between a memberof the Foreign Office and M. Capitant, the Gaullist leader in Algiers.A. E.Foreign Office, February 22, 1943.ANNEX.M. Capitant, the head of the Gaullist Movement in Algiers, who has cometo London with the consent of General G iraud to make contact with the national committee, called on the 15th February.2. M. Capitant gave an encouraging account of the local situation and expressed himself as being optimistic as regards the prospects of an agreementbetween General Giraud and the Gaullists. His analysis of the situation is asfollows : The Gaullist Movement in North Africa grew up under an impulse which did not come wholly from General de Gaulle, though its members found that hisacts and speeches were in harmony with their own ideas. The Gaullists in north Africa are less intransigent and doctrinaire than the Gaullists of metropolitan France or the Gaullists of Carlton Gardens. About 10 per cent,of them take the uncompromising, view of Carlton Gardens; the rest take,broadly speaking, the normal Republican view, and the main thing for them isthat as many Frenchmen as possible should get together to fight the Germans.The only Frenchmen with whom they would have no dealings are those who are really acting for or with the enemy.3. According to M. Capitant, the main danger in North Africa has alreadypassed, and tension has greatly relaxed. There is, he said, a group of people in north Africa, some of them still in positions of authority, who tried to use theAllied landing as a means of establishing a Fascist regime in North. Africa underthe Comte de Paris, with the ultimate object of establishing a Fascist regime inFrance. It was for this reason that they helped the Allied landing. They weredisconcerted by the assumption of power by Darlan, and it was they whoorganised his assassination in the hope that the Comte de Paris would be elected by the Imperial Council. Their plans were frustrated by the refusal of the allies to have anything to do with the Comte de Paris. They had hopes thatGeneral Giraud would support them, but they have so discredited themselves thatany danger of this is now past. They took their revenge on the Gaullists bytrumping up the charges which led to the arbitrary arrests of the 29th December.These charges against the Gaullists had now been recognised as false by thejudicial authorities, and the only persons arrested on the 29th December who arestill in custody are those who were in fact implicated in the monarchist plot.MM. Bergeret and Rigaud, who are still in office, and M. Pose, who is out of11978   [25075]
office, are members of the group. M. Lemaigre-Dubreuil also has affiliationsthough he is rather a plutocrat than a monarchist, M. Capitant thought thatMM. Bergeret and Rigaud would have to be eliminated sooner or later, but he did not think there Avas any hurry. They were quite discredited, even in north africa, and avc could well wait until good men could be found to take their placesOne of the difficulties in North Africa was the lack of good men.4. General Nogues Avas too astute to be mixed up in plots of this kind, buthe. too. Avas of little further utility and could be remo\red without much difficulty.No one had a good word to say for him. M. Boisson was a stronger character and not at all an estimable one. but he seemed to enjoy the support of theAmerican and British Governments : it would, hoavever, be difficult for theGaullists e\&quot;er to collaborate with him.5. On M. Peyrouton, M. Capitant was interesting. He said that he had found intense animosity against him at Carlton Gardens, and he understoodthat M. Peyrouton had a bad press here. It was clear, however, thatM. Peyrouton has found some favour in M. Capitant&apos;s eyes. For one thingM. Peyrouton is strongly opposed to the monarchist-Fascist group. He has a republican past and is obviously determined to redeem himself in the eyes ofhis fellow-countrymen and the Allies since he is now firmly convinced that theGermans have lost the avar and that France must come back into the fight again.M. Peyrouton is also, M. Capitant thinks, sincerely desirous of an agreementwith the Gaullists, and has appointed one of them, M. Brunei, to the chairman-ship of the new economic council. tie is alloAving the Gaullist newspaper to appear, subject, of course, to the Avar-time censorship. And he is working his way towards the re-establishment, so far as this is possible in local conditions, ofRepublican institutions.6. M. Capitant regretfully admits, hoavever, that M. Peyrouton&apos;s personalityis one of the main obstacles to a rapprochement betAveen Algiers and CarltonGardens, and he thinks it not at all out of the question that. M. Peyrouton mightretire from the Governor-Generalship and take up a military appointment, topave the way for an agreement if it were clear that he alone stood in the way,7. M. Capitant had obviously been a good deal disconcerted by thedoctrinaire ideas held in Carlton Gardens, and seems to be doing his best tobring General cle Gaulles headquarters to a more tolerant state of mind. Inthis he will, no doubt, be assisted by M. Massigli.8. He thought that the Fighting French delegation to Algiers Avas wellchosen. General Catroux was the right man to head it, since he kneAv north africa Avell and had a good political head.9. The despatch of the delegation to Algiers should have two beneficialeffects :  In the first place, it should encourage the North African Gaullists, using the word in its broadest sense. Already they were no longer an illegalsemi-subversiAre society. In time, they might become the legitimate liberalopposition, collaborating with the administration, so far as they could,- for thepurposes of the Avar.In the second place, General Catroux&apos;s presence should hasten the fulfilment of the Casablanca agreement betAveen General cle Gaulle and General Giraud asregards the restoration of &quot; human liberties.&quot; General Giraud had already done a good deal, but the process might Avell be accelerated. It was not true to saythat the removal of the disabilities at present suffered by the Jews would causediscontent among the Moslems : the Jews had been so scandalously treated in thepast that even the Moslems had been disgusted, and they would regard the removalof the worst of these disabilities as an act of justice.10. M. Capitant proposes to stay here until after the departure ofGeneral de gaulle&apos;s mission to Algiers. He spoke in the warmest terms ofMr. Macmilian, and had a kind word even for Mr. Murphy, although he saidthat he did not always agree with him.
