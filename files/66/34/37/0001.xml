THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1943.W.P. (43) 87.February 25, 1943.\WAR CABINET.153SECRET. Copy No.   53REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY 1943 FOR THE DOMINIONS,,   INDIA,    BURMA    AND    THE    COLONIES    AND   mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.General Position.THE news of the conference between Mr. Churchill and the United StatesPresident at Casablanca created the greatest interest and considerable satisfactionin all the Dominions, though, in view of official reticence concerning thediscussions, press comment was not extensive, and speculation on the outcome was kept within orthodox limits. The general conclusion reached was that theconference must have resulted in comprehensive plans for an offensive by theUnited Nations in 1943. In all the Dominions regret was expressed that ithad proved impossible for Premier Stalin and General Chiang Kai-shek to be present on what was generally felt to have been a momentous occasion. though there were some mischievous suggestions that there were other reasons forM. Stalin&apos;s absence than the official ones, the great body of Dominion publicopinion accepted the official version without demur.2. The Russian successes in January continued to excite enthusiasm andadmiration, the relief of Leningrad, and the destruction of the Germans west of stalingrad, being particularly hailed with immense satisfaction, and these greatachievements evoked further tributes to Russia&apos;s endurance and striking power,and also to the tenacity of the British effort in maintaining her convoy supplies.3. In the campaign in North Africa the capture of Tripoli by the eighth army gave general satisfaction, with notes of praise for the triumphant solutionof the difficult supply problem. What one South African paper described as the&quot;unsavoury political mess&quot; in North Africa has, however, continued to causes considerable disquiet, the argument being that decisive military progress wouldbe impossible until the political confusion had been cleared. Some criticism ofthe conduct of the campaign in Tunisia, and of the handling of news under thedirection of--the United States (which is thought in some quarters to have played a considerable part in obscuring the facts of the situation), has been evident.Reported alleged differences between the United Kingdom and the United States,with regard to the policy to be adopted towards the retention of former VichyFrench officials tended to mystify the public in all the Dominions, andM. Peyrouton&apos;s appointment was accordingly the subject of some criticalcomment.4. The volte-face of the German propaganda machine in openly admittinggrave military reverses on the Russian front was quickly noted, and the news offurther heavy air raids on Berlin was accepted as one more sign of an increasinglyaggressive spirit on the part of the Allied Nations.5. The gravity of the U-boat menace, to which attention has been calledhi all the Dominions, is as yet hardly realised by the public as a whole, one reason[25066] b
for this being given by a New Zealand newspaper as due to a great extent tothe Admiralty decision not to publish figures for merchant shipping losses. ]this connexion the urgent need for increased construction of naval and merchant ships has been emphasised in the Canadian press.CANADA.6. The prospect of collaboration between Generals de Gaulle and Giraudwas warmly welcomed in Canada, particularly by the English press. ActionCatholique makes indiscriminate mention of de Gaulle, Darlan, Giraud andRetain as great, though in some cases mistaken. Frenchmen who have beenfaithful to their country.7. The declaration of war by Chile gave much satisfaction, but little interest was shown in the similar declaration by Iraq.8. In matters affecting the British Commonwealth the appeal by Mr. Curtin,the Australian Prime Minister, for more aid, came in for some criticism, and interest continues to be shown in the political situation of India.9. In home affairs the principal event was the serious strike of thesteelworkers at Sydney, N.S., and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, which beganon the 14th January. 13,500 steelworkers have been idle, and it is estimatedthat two-thirds of Canada&apos;s steel production was affected. The strike took place as a protest against the decision of the majority report of the Royal Commissionnot to recommend an increase in basic wage rates in the districts affected.A compromise was reached as a result of a conference between the Federal cabinet and representatives of the employers and employees, when Government proposals were put forward for the designation of the steel industry as a &quot; nationalindustry,&quot; thus making possible the resubmission of the dispute to tin; national war Labour Board and also for an immediate increase in basic wage rates of55 cents an hour. The Canadian Government made it clear that, they wouldadhere to their price ceiling and wage stabilisation policy. By the 27th Januaryno more than 5,000 of the employees concerned were back at work, and the effectof the strike on war production generally cannot be other than serious.10. The public is showing greater interest in the personal future ofMr. Bracken, the newr leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, than in itssomewhat unexciting party programme. Mr. Bracken has been succeeded asPremier of Manitoba by Mr. Stuart Garson.11. In Quebec the &quot;Bloc Populaire Canadien,&quot; which is opposed to conscription, but moderately radical in its economic policy, attracts growingsupport. A notable feature of the next session of the Quebec ProvincialLegislature will be the introduction by the Government of a measure of compulsoryeducation.12. The Canadian Supreme Court has now endorsed the validity of thepowers delegated by the Governor-General in Council to the wartime Controllers,and, although some critical discussion arose about the powers given to wartime&quot; bureaucrats,&quot; the Canadian public is alive to the dangers of over-centralisation.13. Sir Lyman Duff, who is 79 years of age, has had his term of office as chief Justice of the Canadian Supreme Court extended for another year.14.   A new session of the Canadian Parliament began on the 27th January.15. The estimated total of Canadian Government expenditure for thefinancial year 1942-43 has risen to 4-5 billion dollars, which is some 600 million dollars more than the forecast given in the budget last June. At the same time,the total estimated revenue from taxation has increased by 100 million. the gap to be filled by loans and voluntary savings now amounts to 1,950 million.Naval, Military and A it A activities.16. Royal Canadian Air Force. During January, there were 28 squadronsactive in the United Kingdom, one in India, one in Egypt and two inactive in theUnited Kingdom, namely, 430 and 431 Squadrons, in process of formation.17. R.C.A.F. squadrons in the United Kingdom increased their operationalflying time by 25 per cent, to 30 per cent, upon Decembers figures. This was-mainly because seven squadrons which had been operationally inactive on account
of either converting to new-type aircraft or being in process of formation becameoperational during the month. Had the weather been more favourable, an even greater increase would ha,ve been recorded.18. All medium and heavy bomber squadrons have now come under thecontrol of No. 6 (R.C.A.F.) Group except two, which are in No. 4 Group, and one,which is attached to Coastal Command. No. 6 (R.C.A.F.) Group came intooperation on the 1st January under the command of Air Vice-MarshalG. E. Brookes, R.C.A.F.19. Members of No. 408 (Halifax) Squadron were awarded four Distin-distinguished Flying Crosses and four Distinguished Flying Medals during January.20.   During the month, nine bombers and six fighters were reported missing.Economic and Financial.Financial arrangements between the United Kingdom and Canada for the year1943.21. The &quot; billion dollar gift &quot; which Canada made to the United kingdom in the Spring of 1942 was expected to cover our adverse balance of payments with her until well into 1943. But the rate of our expenditure proved to have beenunder-estimated and the gift was in effect exhausted by the 31st December, 1942.During January discussions have been taking place in Ottawa about the financial arrangements for the year 1943. As a result, Canada proposes to render further assistance to us which will have the result of relieving our balance of payments and our budget during 1943 to the extent of something like  300 million.22. The proposals were announced by the Minister of Finance in a speech in the Canadian House of Commons on the 8th February. They can be summarisedbriefly as follows :  (i) Canada will purchase from the United Kingdom munitions factoriesbuilt at our expense in Canada to supply us with arms. This trans-action is expected to involve a payment of about S205 million,(ii) Canada will assume, from the 1st April, 1943, full financial respon-sibility for 35 Royal Canadian Air Force Squadrons now formed orforming in the United Kingdom, in addition to the cost of threeR.C.A.F. Squadrons which she already bears. This will afford relief to our budget to the extent of the sterling equivalent of at leastfl 185 million before the 31st December. 1943.(iii) Canada will procure in Canada and transfer to the United Nations war supplies up to a total of S 1,000 million.No doubt the major part of the supplies mentioned in (iii) above will, in fact, cometo the United Kingdom, and the general effect of these arrangements should, on present estimates, enable us to meet our adverse balance of payments with Canadauntil at least the end of 1943. To cover the gap pending the approval of these arrangements by the Canadian Parliament we have sold to Canada United Statesdollars to the value of $U.S. 150 million.23. As part of these arrangements a body, to be called the &quot; Canadian war supplies Allocation Board,&quot; is to be set up to &quot; give, exchange, transfer or other-wise&apos;ma,ke available &quot; war supplies produced by Canada to any member of theUnited Nations. In form the new gift will differ from the old in two respects :it will be a gift of goods and not money; also, in order to make it more readilyacceptable to the Canadian public, it will be a gift to the United Nations and notmerely to the United Kingdom. The manner in which the new arrangements willwork is not yet clear in many respects. It is understood that the new Board willenter into contracts and also take over the fulfilment of current contracts: up to apoint, therefore, the procedure will be analogous to lend-lease.Canada-United States Joint Committee on Farm Products.24. It was announced on the 6th January that arrangements had been made between the Canadian and United States Governments, under which the shortageof farm products in the United States might be met either by Canada increasingher food exports to the United Kingdom and the other Allies, or if necessary by canada making direct exports to the United States. For example, Canadian[25066] b 2
meat, dairy produce and feeding grain might be used to help the United states to meet civilian supplies and lend-lease requirements. On the 10th January it was announced that a joint United States-Canada Committee had been set up toco-ordinate production and marketing of farm products in Canada and the UnitedStates and to ensure closer co-operation between these two countries in exportingfood to the United Kingdom. Mr. Gardiner, the Canadian Minister of Agri-culture, said that the chief value of the Committee would be that it would place the two countries in a better position to meet Great Britain&apos;s food requirements;it would prevent any overlapping in the supplies of such food-stuffs as dairy andhog products and by the same process would afford the maximum production ofsupplies for home consumption and also make possible long-term planning of farmproduction.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.25. Japanese concentrations at Rabaul during January gave rise to renewedfears of an imminent attack on Australia. Mr. Curtin&apos;s appeal for more aid,and, particularly, his emphasis on the need for increased air-power, was supportedby the entire Australian press, though many newspapers pointed out at the sametime that the Commonwealth can hardly expect the Allies to make more sacrificesthan she is prepared to make herself. The press, too, dwelt on the heavy cost in australian man-power of the very difficult Papua campaign ; there is widespreaddoubt of the wisdom of attempting to dig the Japanese out island by island,rather than go all out by a bold onslaught on metropolitan Japan. In this conflict of view. Mr. Attlee&apos;s speech was taken as reassuring evidence that the claims ofthe Pacific theatre were not being overlooked at this end.26. The announcement of the abolition of extra-territorial rights in china was welcomed as no more than China&apos;s due, and occasion was taken to point outthat Australian development was closely bound up with the question of thesecurity and development of the Malayan Archipelago.27. In a leader in the Sydney Morning Herald, the need for the BritishCommonwealth of Nations to maintain the leadership gained in war in times of peace, so as to ensure that the fruits of victory were not again imperilled, was stressed. &quot; The weak spot in Imperial relations now is not between Great Britainand the Dominions, but in the ignorance of Dominion people of one another.&quot;28. In home affairs a crisis has arisen over the man-power question.Consternation was caused by the Prime Ministers statement that the scale ofproduction will have to be reduced in order to meet the needs of the Army, andthere have been suggestions that Australia&apos;s war production has beenuneconomically spread over too diverse a range of equipment. There are reportsof a clash between Mr. Ward, Minister of Labour, and Mr. Dedman, Ministerof War Organisation, over the suggestion, supported by Air. Curtin, that thecontrol of man-power should be transferred to a non-political authority, and theforthcoming Parliamentary Session may well be the stormiest which the Govern-rnent has yet had to face. The Governments difficulties spring from internalweaknesses rather than from the Opposition, which, however, presses the allegation that the Government is using its powrers for its own ends, to &quot; introducesocialism by stealth.&quot; There is little interest in the Governments Social Securityplans and some criticism of the proposal to spend additional millions in war-time.29. The Militia Bill has come in for outspoken censure. The proposedlimitation of the area in which Australian forces are to be employed, to theS.W. Pacific (enabling the Militia to fight in New Guinea, Timor and some ofthe more northerly Solomons, but not, except as volunteers, in New Zealand, NewCaledonia, or northern territories like Java), came unfortunately on the heelsof Mr. Curtin&apos;s appeal for more aid, which was thought to be tantamount to an invitation to the United States to send more of her troops to fight far beyondher shores, for the benefit of Australia, in. areas where the Commonwealth herselfis unwilling that her own troops should fight. Mr. Menzies stigmatised themeasure as &quot; inflexible, parochial and isolationist.&quot;30. Prosecutions have been instigated against workers who absented them-^selves from their posts, in contravention of the Governments instructions, on new Yeats Day.31. Plans for post-war reconstruction are reported to include immigrationprojects intended to build up Australia^ population to at least 20 million withinthe next 20 years.
Naval, Military and A ir A ciivities.32. H.M.A.S. Westralia is being converted from an armed merchant cruiserto a landing ship (infantry).33. As a result of experience gained in New Guinea of the type of reorganisation required for jungle fighting, it has been decided that four infantry divisions will be organised as jungle divisions.34. In view of the number of tanks now in Australia, further imports havebeen cancelled, except for 32 M. 3 light tanks. The only further arrivals will hethose at present en route.  The whole position will be reviewed in six months.35. The number of United States troops in Australia at end of Januarywas 123,368, of which 81,392 are ground troops.36. The 1st United States Marine Division from the Solomon Islands isbeing concentrated in Victoria for rehabilitation and refitting.37. Timor. Enemy activity has increased and our troops are concentratingin three areas to stop the enemy thrusts into our territory. Enemy natives areviolently hostile, while those in our territory are frightened and wavering.38. New Guinea. During November and the first half of December 1942,admissions to hospital for malaria amounted to nearly three times the number of battle casualties.39. The 9th Australian Division has left the Middle East on its return toAustralia.&apos; NEW ZEALAND.40. New Zealand, sceptical about the threat to Australia, is now indulgingin a mood of sober optimism concerning the situation in the Pacific. Inevitably,with the lessening of danger, there has come some relaxation of effort, instanced,for example, by the failure of a substantial proportion of an army contingentdestined for New Caledonia to report, as directed, for embarkation. Faultyorganisation on the part of the army authorities was held to be partly responsiblefor this.41. The question of the disposal of the wool revenue has become a politicalissue. In May last the United Kingdom Government granted a 15 per cent,increase in wool prices. The Government^ proposal to allocate only 8-1 per cent,of this increase to the wool growers, and to retain 5^ per cent, for a special reserve fund for stabilising production, and 1 per cent, for maintaining the domesticprice of wool, has been vigorously attacked as robbing the growers. As a resultof criticism, the Prime Minister has announced the Government^ decision todeduct only 1-2 per cent, for stabilisation purposes.42. The Christchurch by-election, in which the Government candidatecarried the day, has been an event of some local importance, though the fact thatno fewer than three members of the War Cabinet took part in the campaignevoked comment deprecating such signs of the vigour of party strife during thewar. The Minister of Supply, who opened the campaign, took the occasion torefer to the vexed question of the return of the New7 Zealand Division from theMiddle East. His remarks were criticised as being unhelpfully non-committaland as being inspired mainly by electioneering motives.43. The visit of a representative of the B.B.C. to New Zealand has beenmade the occasion for solid tributes to the work of the Corporation.Naval, Military and Air Activities.44. H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles was operating with United States Task Forces inthe South Pacific area. H.M.N.Z.S. Leander was refitting at Auckland.H.M.N.Z.S. Monowai was employed on task duties in the South Pacific.H.M.N.Z.S. Kiwi and most (minesweepers) destroyed a large enemy submarine oft&apos;Guadalcanal.45. The start of the year found the 2nd New Zealand Division in the Nofiliaarea between El Agheila and Bouerat. Towards the middle of the month theyagain started moving up to continue the pursuit of the Axis forces then holdingthe Gheddahia-Wadi Zem Zem position.
46. Early on the 17th the Eighth Army advanced to attack this position with the 51st (Highland) Division on the right and the New Zealand Divisionon the left; fighting lasted all day, but during the night the enemy continuedhis withdrawal followed up next day by our troops, the New Zealanders being directed on Sedada. This withdrawal continued covered by rear guards, which made prolific use of mines and demolitions to delay our forces. By the 23rdTripoli had been reached and was entered by our forward elements in the early morning; at this time the New Zealand Division, still on the left, were abreastof Tripoli but about 28 miles further south at El Azizia. New Zealand casualtiesthroughout this further advance were slight.47. Henceforward contact with the enemy was maintained by our lightmobile troops, while the larger formations remained in the Tripoli area awaiting the move forward and installation of our supply organisation preparatory to afurther pursuit.48. The favourable development of operations by United States forces inthe Pacific area has cleared the air considerably and, together with definiteindications of further offensive action both in that theatre and also in the south-western area, may be considered to have still further reduced the threat to new Zealand. Despite this, the strengthening of the Home defences has beenactively pursued in order not only to increase the security of New Zealand itself,but also to enable her to render additional support to the more advanced forcesin the offensive operations in the South Pacific,49. The present general disposition of New Zealand Army forces is asfollows :- -(a) In New Zealand-1st Division, Northern District.4th Division, Central Military District (southern part of the NorthIsland).5th Division, South Island.(b) Overseas 2nd Division, Middle East3rd Division, New Caledonia/South Pacific.In addition, New Zealand Army forces are providing independent garrisons in Norfolk Island and Tonga. Both these islands are now provided with serviceairfields, necessitating a garrison for their defence.50. The present deployment of New Zealand troops in the Pacific totals1,017 officers and 15,475 other ranks.51. Following the British decision to alter the composition of armouredand infantry divisions, the 2nd New Zealand Division will adopt the standardBritish divisional organisation, that is to say two infantry brigades and one armoured brigade consisting of three regiments. This change is now beingcarried out.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.52. Field-Marshal Smuts has secured a striking political success with thepassage through the South African House of Assembly, by 75 votes to 49, of his-motion approving the employment of the South African Forces outside the african continent. In the course of his speech introducing the motion, Field-Marshal Smuts said that the part played by South Africa in the struggle would form her title deed to security in the future. Dr. Malan, the Opposition leader,moved an amendment opposing the motion, and demanding &quot; the end of all further participation of South Africa in the war and the bringing back of theSouth African troops to the Union, especially in view of the threatened danger which has been created by the Governments policy of arming non-Europeans andunbridled communistic propaganda.&quot; The defeat of this amendment and ofa &quot; no confidence &quot; motion, sponsored by General Conroy, on the grounds thatthe Prime Ministers motion violated his undertaking to Parliament at thebeginning of the war, by such a handsome majority, increases the prestige ofthe Field-Marshal himself and of his Government.53. At their annual conference in Johannesburg the Labour Party decidedto continue their participation in the Government.   The decision was made
conditional off the Government giving effect to thea Labour Party&apos;s plan for a more effective war effort and for post-war reconstruction, including the Party&apos;s social security Code.54. The first report of the Planning Council set up by the Governmentemphasises the inadequacy of present plans for the re-employment of soldiersafter the war.   This report has received wide publicity in South Africa.55. There has been strong criticism of the Government for its handling offood problems. Lack of foresight on the part of the Government authorities issaid to be the cause of the shortage of maize for feeding stock, and there is widespread dissatisfaction amongst both producers and consumers at theGovernment&apos;s policy.56. The sinkings of merchant and other ships in the Mozambique channelcontinue to cause public disquiet and, in this connexion, prominence has beengiven to an American war correspondent&apos;s report exposing the activities of theformer German Consul in Pretoria, now the chief Gestapo agent inLourenco Marques.57. The Government has given little sign of constructive action with regardto the recent native riots at Pretoria, and the Opposition press has not failedto attribute the blame to &quot; the communistic propaganda encouraged by cabinet ministers.&quot; It is obvious that the &quot; Communist threat &quot; is going to be the bogeyexploited by the Opposition as fully as possible.58. In the South African press there has been much discussion of post-warproblems, particularly of the problems of the African continent as a whole, andespecially of the relationship between, the black races and the white. It has been urged that the Union should play a leading part in the formation of a Pan-African policy regarding natives, transport and communications.59. A committee of Government officials has been set up to investigate theproblems of Social Security and to report to the Prime Minister. This is taken as a proof of the Prime Minister ;s sincerity in grappling with the manifoldproblems of reconstruction within South Africa, which, in all their complexity,will have to be dealt with when the war is over.Naval, Military and Air Activities. .60. With the arrival in South Africa of the 1st South African division and the return of the 7th Brigade from Madagascar, the third phase of theUnion&apos;s war effort may be said to have ended. The first phase comprised the ethiopian campaign, the second the Libyan campaign and the third theMadagascar campaign.61. The withdrawal of the 1st South African Division for rest andreorganisation after being continuously in operations since November 1941 in libya and before that in Ethiopia has allowed infantry units to be converted toarmoured units. It is intended to form one armoured division in the Middle Easton the basis of a British armoured division and a second armoured division inSouth Africa.. 62. These changes have meant considerable all-round reorganisation bothin the Middle East and in South Africa. The main problem facing the UnionGeneral Staff throughout the war has been limited man-power in a country wherethe military forces must of necessity be formed on a voluntary basis. Even ifservice were compulsory, the problem would remain the same, inasmuch asEuropean man-power is limited and the drain on it in order to maintain theeconomic as well as the war potential of the country is considerable. The man-power problem is, therefore, one of fine adjustment as far as South Africa isconcerned. .63. As a result of a comprehensive scrutiny of the man-power position, itseems possible for the Union to maintain in the field two armoured divisions lessone motor brigade and a field artillery regiment. In addition, Union commitments in the Middle East will, comprise 16 Air Force squadrons as well as engineer,railway and harbour construction companies, tank repair workshops and ancillary services. An additional responsibility is the protection of a considerable coast-line entailing the employment of a Home Air Force, coast artillery and anti-aircraft defences as well as certain light naval units.
SOUTHERN RHODESIA.Economic and Financial.64. The Government of Southern Rhodesia have stated that a decision hasbeen reached to reduce the primary basic petrol ration in Southern Rhodesiaby 60 miles a month from the 1st March. A recent 25 per cent, increase in thevalue of the coupon unit, which was made for purely temporary reasons, will hewithdrawn on the same date. The net effect will be to reduce the mileage allowed by the basic ration from 210 to 110 miles a month.EIRE.65. During January most political interest has been centred round theforthcoming General Election and spokesmen of all political parties have madeelectioneering speeches. Speaking on the 4th January, Mr. Lemass, the Ministerof Industry and Commerce, gave a warning that a Coalition Government, whichmight result from a defeat of Fianna Fail, might be undermined by intrigue, andwas liable to be subjected to pressure from abroad as well as at home. He said the real national need was for a Government which would stick together whenpressure came. War difficulties were accumulating and the year ahead wouldprobably be the most difficult since the war began.66. At a Fine Gael Delegate Convention held in Naas on the 6th January,Mr. Cosgrave stated that in his opinion a National Coalition Government wasimpossible in present circumstances. He said, &apos;&quot;&apos; to have a coalition there must beagreement at least on policy and they had agreement only on neutrality. Therewere two occasions when an attempt might have been made to form a national government, one was on the declaration of war and the other on the fall ofFrance. Neither was taken. The Government said they had a national government, wffiereas everybody knew that it was a Party Government. FineGael were not, like the Government, putting before the people a programme of election promises, they were merely advancing certain aims which they evidentlyhoped to be able to carry into effect, and their main purpose was to improvedevelopment and extend their agricultural industry. They believed at the sametime in the necessity for a balanced economy.&quot;67. Another Government speaker, Mr. MacEntee, said in Dublin on the15th January that, wffien the election campaign came, one of the questions thatthe people would have to ask themselves was, would they have been able tomaintain their neutrality if the ports which the Fianna Fail Government had got back from the British Government had still been in the occupation of theBritish Forces and the British Government still had a right to them. &quot; Thepeople would have to ask themselves to Avhose foresight and statesmanship was duethe fact that to-day they were living in peace and unmolested by any one of the belligerents, and to that question there was only one answer Mr. de Valera anda Fianna Fail Government.&quot;68. On the 13th January, Mr. Norton, the Leader of the Labour Party, saidthat his Party sought to ensure that money would be made the servant and notthe master of man. They had sufficient candidates for the coming election toreturn a Labour Government if the people desired to do so.69. On the 20th January Mr. de Valera made an appeal to County Limerickfarmers for a greater effort in food production. He asked these farmers to try to treble their tillage area. The country, he said, was more and more in a blockadeposition, though that did not mean ill-will on the part of the belligerents. Thosecountries had to keep raw materials for themselves. This position would getprogressively worse. They in Eire could provide some of the primary necessitiesfor themselves. They could make their food supply secure and avoid relying onthe chances of import.70. On the 18th January, the Eire Department of Supplies stated that imports of petrol, kerosene and fuel oil to Eire were to be reduced in 1943. as there was no assurance of delivery it was possible that on occasions there wouldbe no supplies at all. This statement followed a notification to the Eire authorities that deliveries of petrol, &amp;c, to Eire in 1943 would probably not exceed 75 percent, of deliveries in 1942.

71. Exports of live-stock for Eire for 1942, valued at  1,123,748, were lessthan half the total for 1941, according to the trade returns up to the31 st December, 1942. Food, drink and tobacco exports amounted to  1,690,840,as compared with  2,168,230 in 1941.72. The total external trade of Eire in 1942 amounted to  67,276,379, anincrease of  5,914,720 on 1941.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political Sitxiation.73. Allied successes in Russia and North Africa strengthened morale during january, and indeed there was even reported a tendency to regard the main issueof the war as already settled and to concentrate attention on the repercussions ofthe war on India&apos;s daily life. Food shortages and price fluctuations were theabsorbing interest of the day, and temporarily displaced even political issues fromthe forefront of the stage. They have already led to a few riots, but not as yeton a serious scale. Congress disturbances are now reduced to isolated cases ofarson, bomb-throwing and the like, and even in Micinapore (in Bengal), whereCongress have of late been most active, a steady improvement is reported. Onlya few minor disturbances marked the celebration on 26th January of IndependenceDay. the tenth annniversary of the issue by Congress of its &quot; Declaration of independence.&quot;74. The political outlook remains bleak and barren, and there are nodevelopments to report. The few political speeches made during the monthcontributed no fresh hope of a compromise being reached between the varioussectional interests. Symptomatic of the general situation is a resolutionsubmitted, by a Sikh member of the Legislative Assembly; which proposed, that aNational Government should be constituted of all parties except the congress party and the Moslem League, &quot; since it should be recognised that agreementbetween these two parties is almost impossible in the present political situation.&quot;The resolution is to come up for discussion in February.Indian States.75. Allied successes continue to have a, good effect on morale, and butisolated attempts at arson and sabotage are reported from a number of States and food riots have occurred at two places.External and Frontier Affairs.76. Afghanistan. An unfortunate dispute has arisen between the AfghanGovernment and the Government of India over the sale of Afghan raisins andalmonds, which the Government of India Supply Department urgently require for the Army&apos;s operational rations. In order to ensure priority to Governmentpurchasers of all supplies of raisins and almonds, the Government of India tookaction last November to control all exports of dried fruit and nuts from theFrontier Provinces and to fix maximum prices. The Afghan Government sought to take advantage of the needs of the Supply Department by imposing an embargo on the export of dried fruit and almonds from Kabul by the Peshawar route and allowing their monopoly companies to enter the local markets as extensivepurchasers, to the exclusion on Indian traders, who have for a long time handledthe bulk of this trade. At the end of the month the position was that the monopoly companies were only prepared to sell to the Government of India at prices considerably above those which the Government of India consideredreasonable, while the Afghans refused to give any guarantee that business onthe Peshawar route would remain in the hands of Indian traders. Althoughalmonds can be replaced by other nuts available in India, raisins are a necessity,and Sir F. Wylie was therefore instructed to remind the Afghan Government ofInclia&apos;s generosity in the matter of supplies of petrol, cotton textiles, tea and manufactured goods to Afghanistan, and to express the hope that in recognitionof this generosity the Afghan Government would not seek to exploit the urgency of the Government of India&apos;s military needs. It is important that this matter should be settled satisfactorily as soon as possible. The dried fruit trade is animportant element in the economy of Afghanistan, and failure to reach asatisfactory settlement, particularly if the Afghan Government continue tointerfere with the business of Indian traders in Kabul, may result in a serious deterioration of our relations with the Afghan Government.&quot;[25066] -     o

Afghanistan, An unfortunate dispute has arisen between the AfghanGovernment and the Government of India over the sale of Afghan raisins andalmonds, which the Government of India Supply Department urgently require for the Army&apos;s operational rations. In order to ensure priority to Governmentpurchasers of all supplies of raisins and almonds, the Government of India tookaction last November to control all exports of dried fruit and nuts from theFrontier Provinces and to fix maximum prices.

It is important that this matter should be settled satisfactorily as soon as possible. The dried fruit trade is animportant element in the economy of Afghanistan, and failure to reach asatisfactory settlement, particularly if the Afghan Government continue tointerfere with the business of Indian traders in Kabul, may result in a serious deterioration of our relations with the Afghan Government.&quot;[25066] -     o
77. The Afghan Government have asked for the agrement of the UnitedStates Government to the appointment of Abdul Hussain Khan, at presentMinister of Posts and Telegraphs, as Afghan Minister in Washington. As he isknown to maintain contacts with the Italian Legation in Kabul, there is much tobe said for his removal to Washington, and it is possible that the Prime minister may have made the appointment deliberately.78. The Vichy Government have instructed M. Cassin to order M. Ghirsh-man to shut down the French Archaeological Mission and to leave Afghanistan.M. Ghirshman is, in fact, an adherent of General de Gaulle, and the fighting french are prepared to provide the necessary funds to keep the mission going.They hope that, in the circumstances, the Afghan Government will turn a blindeye to the real position and allow M. Ghirshman to remain.79. North-West Frontier. Generally the Frontier remained very quiet. InWaziristan, apart from some activity by hostile gangs, the main pre-occupationwas the scarcity and high price of food-stuffs. The Fakir of Ipi&apos;s plan to launch a campaign for the collection of fines from tribes co-operating with the Govern-ment met with little support.80. Tibet. It was reported that the Chinese Government recently asked the Tibetan Government to allow Tibetan traders to carry supplies to China, andthe Tibetan Government were proposing to reply that they could not do so unlessthe British Government was a third party to the scheme. A reply on these lines isnot likely to be welcome to the Chinese Government.81. China. The Government of India have asked His Majesty&apos;s Ambas-ambassador to obtain the agrement of the Chinese Government to the appointment ofMr. K. P. Menon, I.C.S., as successor to Sir M. Zafrullah Khan as Agent-general for India. Mr. Menon, who is a Hindu, is a senior member of the indian political Service, with wide experience.82. Sinkiang. There wrere some indications that the treatment of Britishsubjects had improved since the recent visit of Messrs. Shipton and Gillett toUrumchi, and there were hopes that Indian traders in Kashgar might shortly beallowed to resume business. In view of the improved atmosphere, and in pursuanceof suggestions made both at Urumchi and Chungking, it is proposed to strengthen our representation in Kashgar so as to admit of the opening of an establishment at Urumchi also.83. Persian Gulf President Fcoosevelt&apos;s New Year speech created an impression on public opinion. Optimism has been substained by continued Alliedsuccesses.84. The public of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf, which are almost wholly dependent upon imported cereals, are, however, greatly concerned aboutthe food situation, owing to the Government of India having been compelled to discontinue shipments. Of these, for reasons of custom and climate, rice is by far the most important. It is hoped that the Middle East Supply Centre will be ableto provide the small quantity of wheat required from sources at its disposal, butthe problem of supplying the necessary rice is one of greater difficulty, largely owing to the deadlock which has arisen over the purchase by the Centre of alarge quantity of rice from the Egyptian Government. The Arab States have atpresent from two to three months&apos; slocks of rice in hand.Finance.85.   Nothing to report.Economic.86. Food situation in India. Apart from 1-1 million tons of rice imported ^from Burma, India is normally self-supporting in food-grains with a crop ofabout 70 million tons, including pulses. The crops of the season 1941-42, whichwere available for consumption in 1942, were below average both as regards riceand wheat, rice was no longer available from Burma and, in addition, therewere large Defence Services requirements of both cereals. Consequently, as early as last April, India was threatened with a statistical deficit of 3,300,000tons of food-grains during 1942. To meet the situation she launched a vigorous&quot; Grow More Food &quot; campaign, the immediate aim being to increase the acreageunder food-grains by 9-^ million acres from which an additional yield of2,174,000 tons was expected, of which a substantial portion would be available for April 1943.
87. The increased acreage aimed at through the campaign has been realised but, at the beginning of December, total failure of the millets crop in bombay with the loss of 750,000 tons, coming as a climax to the losses resultingfrom Indus floods in Sind and a cyclone in Eastern India, extinguished theGovernment of lndia&apos;s hopes of adequate supplies in spite of the loss of Burma.In addition, transport difficulties and large-scale hoarding by producers and merchants, aggravated the problem. By the end of 1942, the Government weregravely concerned at the growing seriousness of the food situation in thecountry, although they were satisfied&apos; that, if hoarded stocks could be got onto the market and distributed fairly among the ultimate consumers, there was little danger of the people of India having to put up with any serious reductionof their normal requirements.88. The immediate problem was to secure supplies of wheat to tide overthe situation until the new Indian wheat crop becomes available in May next.To this end, the Government of India asked His Majesty;s Government to make available additional supplies of Australian wheat to the extent of 600,000 tons,at least 200,000 tons of which was required before the end of April.89. His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed that, in view of the gravity of thefood situation in India, it was necessary that some tonnage should be madeavailable, at the expense of the United Kingdom import programme, for thepurpose of meeting India&apos;s immediate needs of wheat, and that, accordingly,ships available in Australia and elsewhere should be diverted to carry wheat to India before the end of March or early in April. The total tonnage to be sodiverted Avas not to exceed 40-50,000 tons. At the same time, the Governmentof India were to be strongly pressed to divert the maximum amount of Indianregistered tonnage for the carriage of wheat from Australia and with the sameobject the Middle East and Persia and Iraq Commands were asked to reduce their requirements for supplies from India. The Government of India were also pressed, and agreed, drastically to reduce their non-cereal imports from australia. The total tonnage expected to be available from all these measuresup to the end of March is 120-130,000 tons. The Government of India, ontheir part, removed the control on the price of wheat, thus removing a grievanceof the Punjab Government and in return securing their whole-hearted-operation in getting wheat out of hoard and into the market. In addition,the Central Government arranged, in consultation with the Punjab Government,for the immediate institution of a Government purchasing agency to operatedirectly under the control and with the assistance of the Punjab Government,and to set up similar agencies in all surplus grain areas. These agencies willpurchase surplus grain to meet the needs of all deficit areas and the defence services, and will have a monopoly of export across Provincial and State borders.90. By eliminating competition between exporters in the producing areas and increasing supplies in the markets from abroad the Government believe thatthey will be able to exercise a more effective influence over prices than has hitherto been secured by means of statutory maxima. The effects of these measures have yet to be seen.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.91. Royal Indian Navy. In December 1942 and January 1943 the following-vessels have been completed :  In United Kingdom One minesweeper (Bangor).In India Three trawlers.Six 110-foot motor launches (fair miles) (including two transferred from Burma to India to complete).Five 72-foot motor launches.92. A RUN. patrol vessel rammed and sank an enemy launch in the MayuEstuary on the night of the 25th/26th January. Fifty of the enemy are estimated to have been casualties.93. During 1942 vessels of the Royal Indian Navy steamed 1,432,660 mileson escort duty, anti-submarine patrols and protection of the coasts of India and shipping routes.94.   Military. Field-Marshal Wavell visited the Arakan front during themonth.[25066] c 2
95. The Arakan operations have been continued by 14th Indian Divisionboth in the Mayu peninsula and in the neighbourhood of Rathedaung. further to the North-East Kyauktaw has been occupied and patrols are pushing Southalong the Kalandau River. There are indications that the Japanese may bereinforcing the Akyab area.96. In the Chin Hills and Chindwin areas, patrols of regular troops have fought some successful actions against Japanese patrols. While in NorthernBurma, our levies have continued to harass&apos;the enemy and inflict casualties.97. A ir. Operations have been carried out in support of our troops with good effect against Akyab, and against Coastal craft on the Arakan coast. Inaddition, enemy aerodromes have been attacked by day and night, also communica-tions and rolling-stock. The road and railway bridge South of Mandalay wasbroken by the U.S.A.A.F.98. The enemy air effort has not been on a large scale and attacks on our forward positions were not serious. Some damage was done to wharves in tworaids made on Chittagong. In his two raids on Calcutta the enemy used three and four machines respectively. Of these five certainly and one most probablywere lost.99. General. The internal situation has been generally quiet exceptfor isolated incidents. The exodus from Calcutta as a result of air raids has ceased, and many have returned, including some labour. Morale is highest inbombed areas of the city.100. The food situation is causing difficulty, and it has been necessary toreduce the flour ration of Indian troops by one-sixth and issue substitutes in lieu.101. The recruiting intake for December was 61,500, but a shortage inclerical and technical classes for all three services is still being experienced. TheW.A.C. (I) now numbers 173 officers and 3.114 auxiliaries.102. Health figures are still not satisfactory as the incidence of malariaremains high, partly through relapses.103. Morale of the troops, British and Indian, remains good, but there is agood deal of bitterness against profiteering.104. Road construction on the North-West Frontier of Burma is pro-ceeding. It is being hindered principally by lack of lorries. Large numbers ofthese require extensive repair, which has been delayed owing to the malariaepidemic temporarily depleting workshops and transport companies of technical personnel.105. Approximately 200 aerodromes have been constructed in India since june 1942. This has been stated to be equivalent to the construction of a road50 yards wide from Karachi to Calcutta.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Conditions in Occupied Burma.106. There have been indications of anti-Japanese activities by Burmansand Indians. Rangoon Radio announced on the 6th January that nine men hadbeen sentenced to death and seventeen to terms of imprisonment for killingJapanese soldiers and sabotage. Japanese broadcasts that Burma cannot keepher new-found &quot;independence&quot; without fighting for it suggests a lack ofco-operation from Burmans. A recent broadcast complained of an increase in thenumber&apos; of people working for the British and Americans.Japanese Propaganda.107. General Tojo declared at the end of January that Burma would begranted independence this year. Meanwhile the present puppet administration is apparently being beguiled with some semblance of freedom in matters which donot affect Japanese military, political and economic interests.108. Japanese propaganda during January concentrated on military matters, such as Japanese strength in Burma, our inability to take Akyab andtheir air raids on Calcutta and Chittagong.
British Propaganda.109. This is being carried on through a serial newspaper and leaflets inBurmese, Chin and Kaehin dropped, from the air. That our radio propagandahas not been ineffective is evidenced by a Japanese embargo on listening toforeign broadcasts and an announcement that short-wave sets are to be altogetherforbidden. Arrangements are completed for relaying Delhi broadcasts fromDacca to Burma on medium wave, by which it is hoped to counter this move.Frontier Administration.110. Some progress is reported, in the extension of British administration in the Upper Chindwin area. Villagers in this area have voluntarily assisted in improving military roads, as an earnest of their gratification at our return.In the Chin Hills successful brushes with enemy patrols by our levies have greatly strengthened the morale of the tribesmen. Stubborn fighting continues inNorthern Arakan.General.111. The Governor has been on a three weeks&apos; tour in Assam and has madecontact with Government of Burma officers working with the Government ofAssam. In Delhi he had informal discussions with Field-Marshal Wavell andMr. Phillips, President Roosevelt&apos;s Personal Representative in India.112. Reconstruction Committees have been set up to consider Police, health and Prison Administration.113. A Burma Intelligence Corps has been formed with the object ofattaching to all units engaged on reoccupation personnel having experience of burma, knowledge of Burmese and sympathy with the people; the corps is being increased at the request of General Headquarters, India. The latter are alsoconsulting the Government of Burma on the preparation of a directive on thebest lines of approach to the Burmese.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Colonial Food Requirements.114. Ceylon. The embargo by the Government of India, owing to the difficult food situation in India itself, upon exports of food-stuffs from India is causing much difficulty in Ceylon, where indigenous production of food is insufficient for the needs of the Island population as a whole, including the largenumber of Indian labourers working on rubber and tea estates. The Island hadcounted on obtaining not only considerable quantities of rice from India, inrespect of which an assurance was earlier received from the Government of india of the maintenance of supplies, but also of other subsidiary food-stuffs whichcannot be replaced from any other source but India.115. Supplies of wheat have been shipped from Australia to make up tosome extent for the loss of imported rice supplies, but no ship has been availablesince December for loading cereals there for Ceylon. The possibilities ofobtaining rice from other sources are being examined. The total import needs of ceylon in imported cereals are about 40,000 tons a month.East Africa.116. Owing to the failure of the short rains in Kenya a serious position has developed in East Africa. The East African group of territories and alsoSeychelles have been depending on Kenya maize, but this crop has largely failedowing to the weather conditions, and the Kenya potato crop has been a complete failure, while the bean crop, too, has been small. The rice crop in Tanganyikahas also been disappointing.
117. The position is being kept under constant review by the East AfricanProduction and Supply Council, which is the co-ordinating body for this purpose and energetic steps are being taken locally both to reduce consumption to the absolute minimum compatible with the maintenance of essential production andalso to provide alternative food-stuffs from local resources and to attract on to themarket any supplies of maize that may still be available in the reserves or else-where. When all these steps have been taken, it is feared that help from outsidewill be necessary, and it is estimated at present that, in order to meet both civil and military needs, about 45,000 tons of maize will be required. Possible meansof helping to meet, at any rate, some part of this demand are now being investi-gated as a. matter of urgency, and every effort will lie made to avoid having tomake any request for Ocean-going tonnage for this purpose.Northern Rhodesia.118. It was feared recently that a critical situation would also develop inNorthern Rhodesia, where maize was required, particularly for the labour force on the copper mines. It now appears, however, that maize will be available fromthe Belgian Congo rather earlier than was expected, and that the colonial government will be able to meet the situation with the help of some smalladditional supplies of maize and other foodstuffs which it has been possible tosecure from Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia.Defence.119. Cyprus. The War Office have approved a proposal by Commander-imChief, Middle East, that a major-general should be appointed as permanentGeneral Officer Commanding in Cyprus. The purpose of the appointment, broadlystated, is to ensure, continuity and efficiency in defence matters and a betterappreciation of Cypriot problems from the military standpoint,120. Mauritius. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, East Africa,accompanied by Major-General Smallwood and Air Vice-Marshal Wigglesworthand a number of officers of the three Services, has visited Mauritius, arriving onthe 18th January and leaving on the 23rd January. He was then proceeding to theSeychelles.121. The Governor has reported that full discussions were held on a numberof topics, and that the results of the visit were very satisfactory. On the questionof the transfer of the Local Forces to War Office control (see paragraph 113 ofDecember report), the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief has informed theWar Office that he considers that the Mauritius Territorial Force and the home guard should be so transferred. The Governor has also submitted proposals, after full consultation with General Platt, for the reorganisation of the Local Forces.These involve (a) the abolition of the title &quot;Mauritius Territorial Force&quot; andthe creation of separate units, viz., Mauritius Regiment, Mauritius Artillery and mauritius Pioneer Corps; (b) the formation of a Mauritius Labour Corps on a compulsory basis for the provision of labour for defence purposes for all services; (c) the organisation of the Home Guard on a compulsory basis; (d) theissue of regulations empowering the Governor to place any one or more of themilitary forces of the Colony under the control of the Army Council; (e) areaffirmation of the liability of members of the Mauritius Regiment, artillery and Pioneer Corps to serve overseas. These proposals are under examination inLondon. There is also to be an increase in the size of the forces raised inMauritius.Western Pacific.122. (a) Fiji. Very favourable reports have been received of the quality and fighting spirit of the Fiji Commando detachment now serving in Guadalcanal.123. (b) Tonga. At the suggestion of the United States Commander ofthe South Pacific area arrangements are being made for all United States forcesexcept personnel employed in Air Transport Command and weather and com-munications activities to be replaced by New Zealand forces and for New zealand to relieve the United States of responsibility for the defence of Tonga. It isproposed that the terms and conditions under which the new Zealand Governmentwill once again become responsible for the defence of Tonga should be discussed between the New Zealand Government and the High Commissioner for theWestern Pacific, and it has been suggested that the Agreement drawn up at Suvain November 1941 between the Governor and High  Commissioner  and  New
Zealand Government Representatives might, if still considered suitable, beregarded as being once more operative in respect of Tonga. It has been agreed,however, with the United States authorities that the new arrangements shouldnot invalidate the basic Agreement reached in Washington in August 1942regulating the exercise by the United States of their responsibility for Tonga,but that that Agreement should be regarded as in suspense until the defence ofthe Island is once more taken over by United States troops.A aviation.124. Negotiations have been in progress for some time for the extension to the Windward and Leeward Islands of the air service at present operated byMr. Yerex (a New Zealander) between Trinidad, Tobago and Barbados. Theagreements which it was proposed to conclude between the Colonial Governmentsconcerned and British West Indian Airways, a local company which Mr. Yerexhad undertaken to form, contain provision for the reservation to that company of the cabotage (or local) air traffic between the Islands in question. Just whenthe negotiations had been brought to a successful conclusion and the terms ofthe agreements to be concluded to govern the operation of the extended air service had been settled, the United States Government asked that, in view of their military and economic interests in the area in question, the proposals should notbe proceeded with until the United States authorities concerned had had anopportunity of studying the position.125. As a result of discussions with Mr. Taussig, the Joint Chairman ofthe Anglo-American Caribbean Commission, and of the further explanationsfurnished through the Embassy at Washington, the United States Governmenthave now withdrawn their objections to the proposed agreements on the under-standing that they will not be allowed to stand in the way of any futurearrangement for the co-ordination and planning on an international basis of theair services to be operated in the Caribbean area. Authority has now been givenfor the conclusion of the agreements which it is hoped will lead to the provisionof a much-needed improvement of communications between the Windward andLeeward Islands and the other British Colonies in the Caribbean area.Reports on Individual Colonies.Palestine.126. The successes of the Eighth Army, culminating in the capture ofTripoli, together with the serious setbacks to the Germans in Russia, have created a new feeling of security.127. Many Arabs in Palestine are beginning to feel, now that the Axisthreat to the Middle East has been removed and the prospects of an Alliedvictory increased, that they must turn their attention to their own post-warfuture. For this reason the entry of Iraq into the war, on the side of the united nations, is welcomed as promising that at least one Arab country will be in theposition to champion the Arab cause at the end of the war. There is also a growing feeling that prominent Arabs in Palestine must endeavour to form some sort of coherent political body which can work for the Arab interests.128. The public campaign in connexion with the situation of the jews in Europe, mentioned in the last report, has continued. There are indications of growing concern amongst the more level-headed members of the communityat the development in the Hagana (illegal Jewish military organisation) ofspecial &quot; S.S.&quot; detachments, whose training is on Commando lines.129. The continued upward trend of prices is still causing acute concern.The cost of living index shows an increase, as compared with August 1939, of103-5 per cent, for Jews and 151 per cent, for Arabs. The plague threat inJaffa and Tel-aviv is causing concern; but vigorous measures are being taken todeal with it.130. There has been a slight increase in the number of Jews enlisted; but no improvement in Arab recruitment.Ceylon.131. A further message has been received from the Board of Ministersregarding their request for an assurance that Dominion Status will be conferred on Ceylon after the war.
ST&apos;no0&quot;i 132.   This message maintains that the reply already given,  that the secret?&apos;of&apos; re-examination of the constitution, already promised, will be directed towardsJan. ii, 1943. the fullest possible development of self-governing institutions, having regard tothe interests both of the Island and of the Commonwealth, is in far too indefiniteterms to satisfy public opinion in the Island. It further draws attention again to the promises given in the case of India and maintains in effect that the denial of a similar promise to Ceylon will gravely hamper the resolution andco-operation of the Ceylonese in the Avar effort.TetS&apos;md 133.   The views of the commander-in-Chief and of the Governor are beingPersonal tel. sought on certain points that will require clarification before a final reply is sentof Jan. 2i.      i0 fjjjg message.West A frica.134. The Resident Minister held two meetings of the West African WarCouncil during January. On the 17th of January he visited M. Boisson, theGovernor-General of French West Africa, and had a long and satisfactory talk with him. M. Boisson much appreciated the frankness of the conversation and expressed the hope that he could come to the Resident Minister direct on any difficulties.   Lord Swinton welcomed the suggestion.135. The British Economic Mission referred to in the December report has now arrived in Dakar.West Indies.136. Sir Frank Stockdale has returned from this country to the west indies. Sir Frank brought home with him a report which is being printed andwhich will be published.137. Sir Arthur Richards, Governor of Jamaica, has arrived here by air to discuss the Jamaica constitution and other matters.Labour.138. Considerable progress has been made during the last 3 or 4 years, andespecially recently, in the setting-up of Colonial Labour Advisory Boards con-sisting of Government representatives, and representatives of employers and workers in equal numbers, to consider labour questions of immediate concern.Such Boards have been established in Antigua, Barbados, Bermuda, the falkland islands, the Gambia, Grenada, Jamaica, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland., St.Kitts-Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Sierra Leone, Tanganyika Territory, and theUganda Protectorate, and they will shortly be set up in the Gold Coast, Nigeriaand Zanzibar.139. The existing Boards have dealt with a wide range of questions,including wage rates, cost of living, unemployment, relief works, recruitment,employment of women and children, and the abolition of penal sanctions for breaches of contracts of employment.
