[-his DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1943. \%ZSECRET.W.P- (43) 88.February 27, 1943.WAR CABINET.CONVERSATION WITH Mr. de VALERA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I think my colleagues will be interested to see the annexed note of an intervh/hich Sir John Maffey had with Mr. de Valera on the 23rd February, 1943.C. R. A.Dominions Office,February 27, 1943.Note of an Interview with Mr. de Valera on February 23, 1943.Though we talked for nearly two hours there is not much to report on myinterview with Mr. cle Valera this afternoon, the 23rd February, 1943.The progress of the war is a. subject on which he likes to speculate, and he continued to urge the need, for arming Eire against a possible German coup. I told him that, in my opinion, with the war developing on its present lines, it was difficult to see any attraction for Hitler in undertaking a diversion in Eire.Mr. de Valera contested this warmly, though I doubt if he really believes in the theory he maintained. I said that if an attempt Were made we should be ableto deal with it satisfactorily from the air. Probably he feels a sense of injuredamour-propre when told (a) that Eire is of no strategic interest to Britain&apos;senemies; (b) that if need arose Britain would deal with the situation on her own.When I pressed him to define the objects to be achieved by a German landing here,he said : &quot; They could attack your positions in the North &quot; !He was in two minds about Russia. His first line was that, great as had beenthe setback to Hitler&apos;s plans, he would reorganise his strategic scheme by holding a shortened line in the east against a tired Russia and by concentrating on an offensive against Britain. If Hitler did not stage a great offensive inthe spring he, Mr. de Valera, would believe that the power of Germany had waned..But Germany still had vast forces. Hitler was a determined and imaginativeleader. Was it not possible that he had built up a new organisation and a specialair force for an attack against us ? I said that to attack Russia had been Hitler&apos;s most personal and. most spectacular strategic plan. It had gone wrong. No doubthe would turn to other plans. But there must be an increasing measure ofdisillusionment in Germany. As for an attack on Britain, that no doubt was tobe expected, but it was also to be expected that we should be well prepared tomeet it.Mr. de Valera&apos;s second line was that if Russia really overran Germany theposition of England in the subsequent Europe would not be a happy one.Probably Hitler had always regarded Russia as the real enemy and had hoped tohave England on his side. When in Germany in 1927 he had been struck by thehigh regard for England shown by Germans, whereas their dislike for the Frenchwas outspoken. He knew that Germany had not played their hand in a way which enabled us to get on terms with them, but there was no doubt as to thesympathetic links between the two peoples.[25096]
I agreed with him that unhappily Germany had left no other course opento us, and I said that as regards Russia the position was that we were fightinga common enemy, and that so far as the menace of so-called Bolshevism was concerned, I thought many of us would have to think again. A State which could produce the efficiency, the devotion and the patriotism which underlay theRussian military effort must have something to commend it. Mr. de Valeraagreed.I knew something of his difficulties with the critical public opinion here, butit was important to take a long view. I had always hoped that in spite of thepolicy of neutrality the war would not destroy the prospect of reasonably goodfeeling being restored between our two countries. England, as he well knew, was never inclined to nurse grievances. But these years were years of heavy trialfor England and would leave their mark. In her post-war relationships Englandwould not forget that while she was fighting for her life Dublin harboured Axislegations and interned British airmen. Mr. de Valera could only regret thatthe situation here was too difficult to admit of any other line of action.J. L. MAFFEY.February 23, 1943.
