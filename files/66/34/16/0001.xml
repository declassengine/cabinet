LaJdriMBT IS THE &apos;^gJW,jfflBggil^th February, IJLtf,____ WAR CABINETPRODUCTION.&quot;-1. Referring to the issue of the Directive annexed to the Prime Ministersmote on Priorities for Research and Development (W.P. (43) j we considerthat all departments concerned with research work should now undertakeIreviews of the research projects in hand for which they are responsible.Such reviews would enable :&apos;ministers to assess in the light of the Prime/Minister&apos;s Directive the relative value of the various projects.2.    In order that the maximum advantage may be obtained from these reviews3me suggest that arrangements should also be made for them to be consideredcentrally.h.    We recommend that the Paymaster-General should be invited to undertakechief responsibility for the work of central survey, and that the ScientificAdvisers to the Minister of Production should be associated with him in it,together with the Directors of Scientific Research of the Supply Departments[and of the Ministry of Home Security, Scientific and Service representativesof the three Service Departments, and the Secretary of the Department of scientific and Industrial Research.4-    If our colleagues are in general agreement with this proposal, wesuggest that the Paymaster-G-eneral should himself determine the exact natureof the machinery needed to carry out this work, and that the Paymaster-iGeneral should be invited to make periodical reports to the Lord President[and the Minister of Production.J.A.O.L.fGreat George Street,S.W.I.
