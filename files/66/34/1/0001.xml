THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT-Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1943.00Copy No. Of IJWAR cabinet india.FOOD SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.THE War Cabinet at their meeting on the 12th January (W.M. (43)7th Conclusions, Minute 2) invited me to ask the Minister of State whether hecould arrange to send to India an official who had had experience in the middle east in overcoming the tendency of producers of cereals to withhold supplies fromthe market during periods of shortage.2. This proposal has been discussed with Mr. IT. D. Vigor (who is being sent out from the Ministry of Food to advise the Government of India on the Indianfood situation), and with the Ministry of War Transport. Mr. Vigor has also had discussions with Mr. R. F. Kahn, Economic Adviser to the Minister of State,who is now in London and who has had as much experience as any official in theMiddle East in dealing with problems of cereal control.3. The upshot of these discussions is that the efforts of the Middle EastSupply Centre to extract wheat from hoards have met with but limited success,and, in view of the fact that the Centre is under-staffed, some doubt is felt aboutthe desirability of pressing the Minister of State to arrange for an official fromthe Centre to go to India. It is intended, therefore, that the matter should bediscussed in Cairo by Mr. Vigor whilst en route to India, and that he should be instructed to convey his recommendations to the Government of India on arrival.L. S. A.SECRET.W.P. (43) 51.February 2, 1943.India Office, February 2, 1943.[24996]
