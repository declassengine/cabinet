THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1943.SECRET. Copy -No,-W.P. (43) 56.February 5, 1943./WAR CABINET.FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM CANADA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and theChancellor of the Exchequer.WE should like to draw the attention of our colleagues to a new financial contribution of enormous size which the United Kingdom is going to receive from Canada. During the year 1943 the relief to our balance of payments andto our budget as a result of assistance from Canada will, it is expected, be of theorder of  300 million.2. During the war we have had to obtain from Canada munitions,food-stuffs and other supplies to a much greater monetary value than that of thegoods which we have been able to sell to her. At first we kept our heads abovewater largely by selling gold and securities, but later Canadian holdings of sterling increased rapidly. In the spring of 1942 she turned $700 million ofher sterling balances into an interest-free loan, and, in addition, made us anoutright gift of $ 1.000 million. This &quot;billion dollar gift&quot; was expected tocover our adverse balance of payments with Canada until well into 1943. Butthe rate of our expenditure proved to have been underestimated, and thebillion dollar gift was, in effect, exhausted by the 31st December, 1942.3. Discussions have recentty been taking place in Ottawa about the financial arrangements for the year 1943. We have now been informed confidentially ofthe plan which the Canadian Government have decided to adopt. Its chief pointsmay be summarised briefly as follows : (i) Canada will purchase from the United Kingdom munitions factoriesbuilt at our expense in Canada to supply us with arms. This trans-action is expected to involve a payment to us of about $205 million,(ii) Canada will assume, from the 1st April, 1943, full financial responsi-bility for 35 Royal Canadian Air Force Squadrons now formed orforming in the United Kingdom, in addition to the cost of threeR.C.A.F. squadrons which she already bears. This will afford relief to our budget to the extent of the sterling equivalent of some$185 million before the 31st December, 1943.(iii) Canada will procure in Canada and transfer to the United Nations war supplies up to a total of $1,000 million.No doubt the major part of the supplies mentioned in (iii) above will, in fact,come to the United Kingdom, and the general effect of these arrangements should,,on present estimates, enable us to meet our adverse balance of payments with canada until at least the end of 1943. To cover the gap pending the approvalof these arrangements by the Canadian Parliament we have sold Canada UnitedStates dollars to the value of SU.S. 150 million.4. Bills to give effect to the plan are to be introduced in the canadian parliament shortly. Their terms, and the exact form which the new gift willtake, have not yet been settled, but it is understood that a body to be called the&quot; Canadian War Supplies Allocation Board &quot; will be set up with powers to&apos;give, exchange, transfer, or otherwise make available &quot; war supplies produced by Canada to any member of the United. Nations. In form the new gift willdiffer from the old in two respects : it will be a gift of goods and not money; also,[25007]
in order to make it more readily acceptable to the Canadian public, it will be agift to the United Nations and not merely to the United Kingdom.&apos; Nevertheless,in its effect the new gift will be the same as the old; it will be a free contribution by Canada, primarily to the United Kingdom, of all the supplies for which shecannot be paid at the moment. It will thus, like lend-lease, avoid the piling upof war debts.5. We should like to emphasise how large this Canadian assistance is.Canada has a relatively small population, only about ll  millions as against over130 millions in the United States. Nevertheless, her free assistance to us has been running at a rate equivalent to more than a quarter of the lend-lease aid givento us by the United States; per head of the population, therefore, it has been morethan three times as great. She is giving away goods to the value of nearly one quarter of her budget expenditure, whereas lend-lease assistance by the UnitedStates to all countries has been running recently at about one-eighth of her budgetexpenditure. We should have to give away goods and services to the value of something like  1.300 million a year in order to be giving away as high a proportion of our budget expenditure as Canada is doing. The new proposals willplace a tremendous burden upon the Canadian taxpayer. Direct taxation inCanada is now, generally speaking, as high as in this country : it may have to gohigher. The broad position is that Canada is not only devoting as &apos;large a proportion of her national income to defence expenditure as any other country, butthat the proportion of the defence expenditure which is given away in the formof free supplies is higher in Canada than in any other country.6. It should not be taken for granted that the legislation embodying the newgift will be passed without difficulty. A poll in Canada last March revealed onlya 6 to 4 majority to be in favour of a gift to Britain. There may on this occasionbe outspoken criticism from various quarters, including the Isolationist element in Quebec. There is nothing to suggest that the Canadian Government are not themselves fully confident of being able to carry Parliamentary and public opinionwith them. Nevertheless, the next few months before the new Act is passedwill be a period during which it will be particularly necessary for us to do everything that lies within our power to make the task of the Canadian Govern-ment easier. It is, therefore, important that Government Departments, in all their dealings with Canada, should remember the magnitude of the burden which she is accepting in order to render the maximum possible assistance to us, andthat the utmost care should be taken to avoid any action which would be embarrassing to the Canadian Government.7. The Budget speech will afford a suitable opportunity of stressing thegreat measure of relief which Canada&apos;s generosity will have given to our national finances.C. R. A.K. W.February 5, 1943.
