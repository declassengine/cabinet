NAVAL  SITUATION.General Review.1.   There has been little U-boat activity and shipping losses were small.There have been a large number of attacks on U-boats. Three have been sunk and there were two promising attacks.Our submarines in the Mediterranean have been successful against enemy shipping.Home Waters.2. During the evening of the 10th a medium-size escorted ship, lateridentified as an armed raider, probably the Togo (5,042 tons), was sighted offCalais steering down Channel and subsequently put back into Boulogne. On the14th she sailed and! was located in Dunkirk that afternoon. Light naval forcesunsuccessfully attempted to intercept, and aircraft carried out a number of attacks, details of which are given in the &quot; Air Situation.&quot; The Dover batteriesalso opened fire.During the night of the 17th/18th, H.M.S. Garth (destroyer) sank an E-boat off Lowestoft and captured seven prisoners.Naval Albacores attacked a number of R-boats off Gravelines on the 17th;one R-boat was sunk and another probably sunk.Northern Waters.3. Russian Avarships in the Barents Sea sank two enemy transports totalling19.000 tons.Mediterranean.4.   H.M. Submarines have reported the following attacks :  On the 27th January Turbulent probably sank a ship west of Sicily in awestbound escorted convoy. On the 1st February she sank a 5,000-toneastbound ship, and on the 5th she probably sank a 6,000-ton westbound tankeroff the north coast of Sicily. A train at St. Ambrogio station (N. Sicily) wasshelled and hit on the 7th.Unseen sank a 1,500-ton ship in tow in the Gulf of Taranto on the 4th.Unbending sank a 2.500-ton southbound ship off Brindisi on the 9th, and onthe following day torpedoed a 1,500-ton passenger and cargo ship, which was subsequently beached with a broken back.On the 8th, Unison, on patrol off the E. coast of Tunisia, shelled three south-bound laden motor auxiliaries. Two were sunk and the other beached. Asouthbound laden ship of 400 tons was shelled on the 11th.Una sank a 4,000-ton northbound ship off the S. of Italy on the 10th andtorpedoed a similar ship at the entrance to the Gulf of Taranto oh the 15th.5. H.M.S. Pozarica (Auxiliary A.A. Ship), which was torpedoed by aircraft on the 29th January, capsized in Bougie harbour on the 13th due to the engine room bulkhead giving wray.   There were no casualties.On the 11th the spontaneous combustion of a stack of smoke generators storedready for use in a tunnel at Malta caused 33 casualties, four of which were fatal.Black Sea.6. Combined operations by the Russians have been undertaken against twoports in the Crimea, but no details are at present available.Madagascar.7. Considerable destruction was caused at Tamatave by a cyclone. Inaddition to the stranding of H.M.S. Pladda (M/S Trawler), part of the Navalheadquarters was destroyed and damage was caused to breakwaters andlighthouses.Pacific.8. Allied M.T.Bs. attacked Japanese positions in the Waria river area(New Guinea) where coastwise barge activity continues. Three barges were sunkin Hercules Bay on the 15th.
The U.S. Navy Department has announced that the U.S. Cruiser Chicago(8&quot;), one desti&apos;oyer, and three M.T.Bs. were sunk and 22 aircraft lost in the actions off the Solomons between the 29th January and the 8th February.The Japanese losses are estimated as : Destroyers, two sunk, four believedsunk, three left burning- and three hit by bombs; two large cargo ships leftburning; 60 aircraft destroyed and eight probably destroyed.There is considerably less shipping in the Rabaul area than has been usualof late.Australia.9. A convoy from the Middle East with Australian troops arrived safely atFremantle on the 18th.   The Eastern Fleet covered the convoy.Anti-Submarine Operations.10.   In the Mediterranean the following have been reported :  The Dutch submarine Doljljn sank an Italian U-boat off Sardinia on the 8th.H.M.S. Paladin (destroyer) sank a German U-boat off Derna on the 17th.H.M. Ships Wheatland and Easton (destroyers) sank the Italian U-boatAsteria off Bougie on the 17th. Forty-seven prisoners of war, including the captain, were taken.H.M.C.S. Woodstock (corvette) and H.M. Trawlers Westray and Hunda,with US. aircraft, after a hunt lasting 18 hours, probably sank a U-boat offOran on the 13th.In the Atlantic a promising attack was made by a Liberator (B. 24)500 miles S.W. of Iceland (C) on the 15th.There were 24 other attacks reported, 14 by aircraft and 10 by surface craft,including attacks off the Cape, off Takoradi and by Brazilian warships and aircraft.A belated report states that the Russian s.s. Vanzetti, on the 5th Januarywhen off Bear Island, shelled and obtained two hits on a U-boat, after beingherself unsuccessfully attacked.A U-boat was probably mined and sunk off Lorient on the night of the16th/17th (see &quot; Air Situation &quot;).Enemy Intelligence.German.11. Hipper and Scheer were located at Wilhelmshaven on the 18thby P.R.U.A number of reports have been received of the conversion of merchant ships to auxiliary aircraft carriers in German ports.Italian.12. On the 12th, two Cavour class battleships and two cruisers were seenat Taranto, and one cruiser, six destroyers and four submarines at Naples. Onthe 14th, aircraft reported that one of the Littorio class battleships seen at Speziaon the 5th had left.   No warships were reported at Messina on the 14th.Traffic from Italy to Tunisia diminished during the week and the figures forlast week are only about half as large as those for the week before.U-boats.13. There still appears to be a concentration of U-boats to the east of new foundland, but there has been little activity. There is a group of U-boatssouth of the Azores and about six operating between the Cape and Port Elizabeth,where two ships have been sunk.German and Italian U-boats are also active in the Western Mediterranean.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ending the 14th/15th, 862 ships have been convoyed.Of these 208 were in ocean convoys and 654 in British coastal convoys.One ocean boarding vessel, 46 destroyers (including five U.S. destroyers) and7l sloops, cutters and corvettes (including four U.S. cutters), were employed on escort duties.During the week 146 ships in four ocean convoys arrived in Home Waters.Ten ships were lost,
15. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 13th totalled 311,000 tons&quot;compared with 546,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 432,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week5 s imports 89,600 tons were mineral oils of various grades.During January 1,436 ships in 125 convoys were sailed in the WesternAtlantic and Caribbean.   Four ships were lost,Enemy Attacks on Shipping.16. Three ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during theweek. One ship, in convoy, carrying war stores to the Middle East, was sunk offCapetown; a Dutch tanker was torpedoed and beached off Beirut, but was subse-quently refloated; and a U.S, ship was probably sunk off Port Elizabeth.An outbound convoy was attacked east of Newfoundland on the 17th, but, sofar as is known, has suffered no losses.British Minelaying,17. Mines were laid off the East coast. Aircraft laid mines off the GermanNorth Sea coast, off the Biscay ports and in the Mediterranean.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.18. Minelaying by enemy aircraft off the South-East Coast, in the english channel and in the Bristol Channel was suspected on three nights of the week.E-boats were also minelaying off Lowestoft on the night of the 17th /18th.Mines have been destroyed off the East Coast, off Dover, and in the Strait of gibraltar.   Minelaying&apos; is suspected off Bone and off Sidi Barrani.The mine totals, including those in foreign waters, are 4,167 ground and2,196 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.19. The German tanker Nord Atlantic. 9,897 tons, which is in Vigo, appearsto be making preparations to sail.The German Grete, 1,563 tons, arrived at Valencia on the 8th and sailed again for Marseilles two days later with a cargo of onions. German broadcasts on the.13th stated that she had been sunk by a British submarine on the night of the10th/11th and that the crew was saved.The Italian tanker Albaro, 2,184 tons, arrived at Istanbul on the 15th.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map of Tunisia and another showing operations in Russia areincluded in this Resume as insets.)The Russo-German Campaign.Northern and Central Sectors.20. The Germans claimed on the 16th that south-west of Lake Ilmen theRussians had resumed their attacks with numerous tanks and strong artillery-support, but there is no confirmation of this from other sources.Kursk Sector.21. In the course of mopping-up operations in the-area west of Livni theRussians have captured Droskovo The pause in the Russian advance in this sector may be one to the need for clearing up reconquered territory.Kharkov Sector.22. After crossing the Upper Donetz the Russians have captured the large and important city of Kharkov, capital of the Ukraine, thereby depriving theGermans of a very important junction. The rapidity with which the city was captured may well have led to the seizure by the Russians of very considerable and valuable booty, as Kharkov was one of the main German bases.
Donetz Sector and Donetz Bend Sector.23. The Russian capture of Krasnoarmeisk has deprived the Germans ofthe use of all the railways going west from the Donetz Bend except the lineStalinc-Zaporozhye, which is of first importance to the German forces with-drawing from this Bend; the Germans must therefore make every effort to holdthis railway line. In the salient formed by the Bend they have beenwithdrawing rapidly. The Russians, following up closely, have capturedVoroshilovgrad and Rostov and a large number of villages between these twoplaces. They have thus finally cleared the whole double track railway Moscow-Voronezh-Rostov-Baku .Tit man Bridgehead and Caucasus.24. The German bridgehead in the Taman Peninsula has been subjected to heavy Russian pressure, and the Germans have been driven back west ofKrasnodar. The Russian landings south of Novorossisk are now frimly established.Summary.25. By the capture of Kursk and Kharkov the Russians have now brokenthrough two of the main bastions of the German winter line of 1941-42, and thereis still no evidence to suggest where the Germans may hope to stabilise the battle.It is reported that the weather as far north as Moscow is very mild, and should there be a prolonged thaw this would seriously impede the Russians in their operations.French North Africa.Tunisia.26. In Central Tunisia a heavy German attack was launched at dawn onthe 14th westwards from Faid. The thrust was in two directions, the mainstrength being directed north-west of Sbeitla and a lighter column drivingsouth-west towards Gafsa.27. In their northern thrust the Germans met with initial success. By0715 hours, 20 of their tanks had reached a point five miles north-east ofSidi Bouzid while the village itself was subjected to dive-bombing. By noon50 enemy tanks with infantry and artillery had, in spite of a small TJ.S.counter-attack, reached the north-west slopes of Djebel Lessouda and wereadvancing south-west to the Faid-Sbeitla road. Throughout the morning of that day a heavy armoured battle took place in the Sidi Bouzid area, and in result theU.S. armoured forces were compelled to withdraw to the south-west, havingsuffered substantial tank casualties, largely through bombing. The Germanattacking force was estimated to consist of between 90 and 130 tanks, includingabout six Mark VI heavy tanks. Twenty enemy tanks were put out of action. Bythe end of the day U.S. infantry forces were still holding positions on thehigh ground north and south-east of Sidi Bouzid. and at dawn on the 15th,U.S. armoured forces launched a strong counter-attack southward from thearea north-west of Sidi Bouzid. A long and inconclusive battle continued allday, resulting at 1600 hours in our forces consolidating their positions north andsouth of Sidi Bouzid.28. Meanwhile the lighter enemy thrust south-west towards Gafsa had met with comparatively little opposition, and in the afternoon of the 15th a smallenemy mechanized column entered Gafsa. The small Allied force in that townhad been withdrawn on the night of the 14th /15th to Feriana, whereorganization of the defences was accelerated.29. At mid-day on the 16th the enemy returned to the- attack in the SidiBouzid area, using some 40-60 tanks, and confused fighting continued throughoutthe day in the area south-east of Sbeitla. U.S. casualties are reported tobe heavy, and in addition by the end of the 16th they had lost about 86 mediumtanks, guns and vehicles. Their infantry forces, which had been holding out near Djebel Lessouba, had been successfully withdrawn, but a small detach-ment still held out on the high ground five miles south-east of Sidi Bouzid.30. At midnight on the 16th/ 17th the enemy attacked again in brightmoonlight and penetrated our positions three miles east of Sbeitla and fightingtook place in the outskirts of the town. The airfield at Sbeitla had been evacuated,but the town remained in Allied hands. ,
31. Meanwhile, a mixed U.S. force took up positions along the riverrunning east from Kasserine, while U.S. armoured forces were ordered tomove through the Kasserine pass northwards to Thala. At the same time french forces further north, in order to conform with the situation in the south, withdrewto a chain of hills running south-west from Djebel Serdi.32. By the morning of the 17th the airfield of Thelepte, five miles north of Feriana, had been abandoned although a holding force at Feriana was in position. The remainder of the garrison from Feriana was moving west to blockthe pass at El Ma-el-Aboid, about 15 miles south of Tebessa. The U.S. infantrydetachment south-east of Sidi Bouzid was still holding out while the remainder of the U.S. armoured forces were withdrawing through Sbeitla towardsKasserine.33. On all other sectors activity was reduced to a minimum by the rainand snow.Eighth Army.34. The capture of Ben Gardane on the 15th by leading troops of an armoured division marks the end of a phase during which the enemymade full use of the marshy nature of the terrain between Zuara andBen Gardane to delay our forces. The weather has been bad, and consequentlyour advance in face of enemy rear guards has been slow. The rain-soddencondition of the marshes in the frontier area has made movement across countrydifficult.35. On the 7th, the enemy was holding positions astride the road east ofRas Adjir. In order to get round the southern flank of this opposition, our troopssecured a bridge-head across the marshes 10 miles east of Taguelmit. A causewaywas constructed, and the main axis of our advance was through the bridge-head&quot;.The enemy reacted by concentrating 30 tanks in this area from Ben Gardane. our forward troops were shelled, but there was no counter-attack.36. By the 17th, our infantry were a few miles north and west ofBen Gardane, and our armoured-car patrols were active along the Ben Gardane-Foum Tatahouine road for 30 miles, then turning due south to the Dehibat area on the Tunisian-Tripolitanian frontier. Small detachments were pushingforward against Medenine, which they reached by last light.Burma.Arakan.37. There has been no major change on the Mayu Peninsula andRathedaung fronts. On the 10th an attempt by our troops to dislodge enemyfrom a hill one mile north of Donbaik (six miles north of Foul Point) wasunsuccessful. At some places on this front our forward positions are only thirtyyards from those of the Japanese. The enemy appear to be digging in roundKamai (five miles east-north-east of Rathedaung).Chin Hills.38. In the Chin Hills a Japanese force, estimated to be a company strong,attacked positions held by our levies on the 9th and again on the 10th. Bothattacks were beaten off with loss to the enemy, and the levies still hold their positions.South-West Pacific.New Guinea.39. In the recent operations in the Wau area, 30 miles south-west ofSalamaua, Australian troops have inflicted over 850 casualties on an estimated total force of 2,500 Japanese.Solomons.40. According to a report from the U.S. Naval Department, in the final stages of operations on Guadalcanal, U.S. troops killed 6,066 of the enemy, and took 127 prisoners from a force estimated at 8,000.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.41. Strong forces of our bombers attacked Lorient (twice), Milan,Wilhelmshaven and Cologne.Naples and Palermo were raided in daylight. A large number of railwaytargets in Italy and Sicily was successfully attacked by &quot; Intruders.&quot;United Kingdom.42. A total of 28 enemy fighter-bombers crossed our coasts in daylight.Activity on four nights involved 42 long-range bombers, 30 of which operated on one night, when there was a small concentration on Swansea; three aircraft were destroyed, two probably destroyed and one damaged by our night fighters.On another night, nine raiders operated over Plymouth and adjacent counties.On two other nights, a total of three aircraft flew inland for brief intervals.Germany, Northern Italy and Occupied Territory.Day.43. With weather conditions favourable, several successful day operations were carried out.A high-level attack on the port area at St. Nazaire was made by 65 U.S.Fortresses (B. 17) and Liberators (B. 24), which dropped 141 tons of H.E.; resultsas assessed from photographs taken later are referred to in Appendix VI. Ofthe 89 aircraft despatched, six Fortresses (B. 17) are missing and two Liberators(B. 24) collided over this country. The fighter escorts to this operation were notengaged in combat.A raider of the &quot; Togo&quot; class which had been photographed in Boulogneharbour was attacked on the 13th by 11 Bostons (A. 20) and, later in the weekwhen it had moved to Dunkirk, was again attacked by 11 Bostons (A. 20) and21 U.S. Liberators (B. 24). No hits on the ship are claimed, but, at Boulogne,bombs were seen to fall alongside the Mole and, at Dunkirk, many bursts were seen in the area of the docks and tidal basin, and others among petrol tanks andon the E-boat pens. The dock area at St. Malo was also attacked in goodvisibility by 10 Bostons (A. 20), some bombs falling near the south-west entrance to the locks and on the water front, These operations and others against the sametargets, which had to be abandoned&apos; owing to adverse weather, involved thedespatch of 90 bombers, and 57 squadrons of fighters as cover a,nd on diversionary-sweeps. Two U.S. Liberators (B. 24) and six fighters are missing and one U.S.Liberator (B. 24) crashed in this country; eleven enemy fighters were destroyed,two were probably destroyed and nine damaged.Two effective raids by Mosquitoes of Bomber Command were made on therailway workshops and engine sheds at Tours, which were attacked by 17 aircraft from between 50 and 1,700 feet. Considerable damage was done to the mainengine shed, two of the largest workshop buildings were destroyed and many otherbombs fell on the railway centre. A similar target at Poosendaal was attacked by two Bostons (A. 20), which scored hits on the engine sheds and railway tracks.One of these Bostons is missing.The iron and steel works at Ijmuiden were raided twice by a total of 20escorted Venturas, bursts being seen on the coke ovens and near the gas-holders.Four Mosquitoes attacked the John Cockerill Steel and Armament Works atLiege, and two Bostons (A. 20) bombed and hit the Mondeville Steel Works nearCaen.In North-West Germany, the railway yards and workshops a^ Pheine andLingen were bombed from low level by three and four Mosquitoes respectively. at both places sheds were hit and left burning and bombs generally were wellconcentrated on the targets. Emden and targets, nearby were attacked by fiveWellingtons, but no definite results were seen.Seven Mustangs (P. 51) of Army Co-operation Command successfully raidedan S.S. Guards barracks and camp at Amersfoort (Holland). A total of 28machine-gun attacks were made on the buildings and troops.Harassing operations against communications in Northern France and theLow Countries by aircraft of Fighter and Army Co-operation Commands resultedin damage to 43 locomotives, nine barges or small trawlers, and a number oflorries and goods wagons.  Two of our aircraft were lost on these operations.Six sweeps over Northern France by a total of 20 squadrons of fightersresulted in a loss of eight of our fighters and the destruction of three enemy aircraft.
Night.44. Two particularly heavy raids were made on Lorient against which atotal of 843 bombers was despatched. Over 90 per cent, of the aircraft attacked and these dropped a total of 2,122 tons of HE. and incendiaries, the formerincluding two of 8,000 lbs. and 201 of 4,000 lbs. On both occasions visibility wasexcellent&quot; with bright moonlight, added assistance being given by well-placedflares and marker bombs. The success of the two operations is confirmed byphotographs taken on the 16th which show that many parts of the town are nowvirtually devastated. In the old town, only about 100 houses have their roofsintact and in the suburbs about 300 have been gutted or destroyed. Damagethroughout the clocks is widespread and, in the Keroman peninsula, four&apos; craterscan be seen in the roof of the centre U-boat pen.Under similar weather conditions, 122 Lancasters out of 142 despatched,successfully attacked Milan, where 274 tons of H.E. and incendiaries were dropped. The centre of the city was described as a mass of flames, with otherfires burning over almost the whole area. On the same night, four Lancastersbombed Spezia.Deliberate blind bombing technique was employed in two attacks onWilhelmshaven and Cologne respectively. At the former, incendiaries were dropped, and the 207 aircraft which attacked Cologne released 513 tons. In bothoperations, sky marker flares punctually dropped by the pathfinder force indicated the approach and release-point, but absence of photographic and visual evidenceat present precludes an assessment of the success achieved.Blind bombing attacks on targets in the Ruhr were made by a total of nineMosquitoes.From the above operations, 24 of our bombers are missing and. seven crashedin this country.   Three enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat.:t Intruder &quot; operations over Germany, Northern France and the low countries, from which two aircraft are missing, resulted in the destruction oftwo Do. 217s and one locomotive, and damage to 13 trains, four locomotives,26 motor vehicles, two barges and two Do. 217s.Thirty bombers were despatched on leaflet operations over Paris, Vichy andother French towns.Coastal Operations.45. Three ships of 2/3,000 tons were attacked off the Norwegian coast,one with bombs and two with torpedoes, but no results were seen.Typhoons intercepted seven F.W. 190s which were operating against our shipping in the Straits of Dover. Four of the F.W. 190s were destroyed andthe remaining three were probably destroyed; two Typhoons were lost. Typhoonsalso destroyed a Ju. 88 off the Isle of Wight.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 120 were despatched, laid 235 seamines in enemy waters; two of these aircraft crashed in this country. OneWellington proceeding at 500 feet to lay mines off Lorient sighted a U-boat whichcrash-dived. A large explosion followed, probably clue to a mine, and theU-boat sank.Mediterranean.French North Africa.46. Allied aircraft continued to give powerful support to our land forces inspite of storms and poor visibility which, on some&apos;days, made it difficult to findgood targets.Fighter-bombers and light bombers bombed and machine-gunned enemy gun positions, tanks and M.T. in the Gafsa-El Guettar-Sened area and near BenGardane; a number of guns was put out of action, tanks and lorries were destroyed and other targets hit. The airfields at El Aouina, Kairouan andMedinine were bombed; many aircraft were hit on the ground and, during one ofthese attacks, four intercepting enemy aircraft were shot clown, three probably destroyed and four damaged for the loss of one U.S. bomber. On the 15th, duringextensive operations, Allied aircraft destroyed in the air 11 Axis fighters, probably destroyed four more and damaged a further six; three U.S. aircraft were lost.AVellingtons raided Bizerta on two nights; in the second attack 21 tons of bombs were dropped, all of which fell on the docks or in the town.
On the 14th, the enemy&apos;s attacks in the Faid sector (vide Military Situation)were supported by dive-bombers; military sources report considerable casualties to Allied tanks. Operations on that clay in this sector were the most intensiveyet carried out by the German Air Force in Tunisia. Fighter-bombers attackedour troops in the Southern Sector.fripolitania.47. Low cloud and dust storms hampered operations. During the early part of the week, our aircraft attacked dispersed M.T. and other targets on thefrontier. .    . :The enemy attempted several raids on the harbours at Tripoli and Benghazibut the scale of effort was small and attacks were not pressed home.Southern Italy, Sicily and the Sicilian Channel.48. On the 13th Naples was bombed through cloud by Liberators (B. 24)which, two days later, dropped 33 tons of bombs on the harbour, where two ships were hit. Five enemy aircraft were shot down and six more probably destroyed;one Liberator (B. 24) is missing. A bridge south of the city was also bombed;buildings were hit on the airfield at Cotrone and fires started in the town. Onthe 15th, U.S. Fortresses (B. 17) attacked docks and shipping at Palermo; the target is reported to have been hit many times and one large vessel and an oilcistern were set on fire.Malta-based Spitfires, Beaufighters and Mosquitoes carried out night&quot; Intruder &quot; operations over Southern Italy and Sicily; approximately 60 sorties were flown. Thirty-seven trains and locomotives, together with a considerablenumber of trucks, were damaged, some severely. In Italy, railyards at Lauzia.junctions at Nicastro and Marina di Gioiosa and the railway station atCatanzaro were successfully bombed. A schooner was left listing, after an attackoff Saverato (east coast of Italy) by bomb-carrying Beaufighters.On the night the 15th/16th. torpedo-carrying Wellingtons, Beauforts and naval Albacores were despatched from Malta to attack an escorted southboundconvoy previously sighted by aircraft. A 4,500-ton tanker was set on fire north of Pantelleria and, at the same time, one of the ships was torpedoed by M.T.Bs.also from Malta; other ships in the convoy were attacked by our aircraft but,owing to poor visibility, results could not be observed. . On the night 17th/18than eastbound escorted ship of 3.500 tons sank off the north-western point ofSicily after Wellingtons had torpedoed her.Sardinia.49. Seventy-three U.S. bombers attacked the airfields at Elmas, Villacidroand Decimomannu; bombs fell near 30 to 50 aircraft and many fires were started.Four Italian aircraft were shot clown; three Allied aircraft are missing.Crete.50. Liberators (B. 24) and Wellingtons bombed the airfield at Fferaklion on two nights. A total of 24 tons of bombs was released; fires were started,including; a large one near the main runwav.Russia.&apos; &apos; . -51. The Russians claim to have destroyed, during the week ended the 13th,243 Axis aircraft for the loss of 101 of their own. They also, claim a larger number of tanks, lorries, guns and equipment destroyed by their Air force during this period than in recent weeks.Northern Front. Air activity up to the 16th was slight.Southern Front: Donetz Basin. In the Voroshilovgrad area on the 10thand 12th, 16 and 33 Axis aircraft respectively were destroyed. An airfield in theKramatorskaya region was attacked; 28 enemy aircraft were destroyed on theground and 13 in the air. On the 13th a heavy attack on Gorlovka airfield caused considerable damage.Rostov Area. There were air battles on the 10th and 11th and slightactivity during the night of the 12th.  Bad wreather hampered heavier operations.Caucasus and Crimea. The Russians appear still to be concentrating their^ain activity on this front, where weather was good throughout the week.Attacks were made on the airfields at Slavyanskaya and Timoshevskaya in theCaucasus, and Kerch and Bagerovo in the Crimea.   The Russian Air Force also
supported the bridgehead near Novorossisk by incessant attacks on Germanpositions and continued attacking the enemy along the whole Caucasus front.Increased bombing by the Germans was reported between Kursk and Orel.There would seem to nave been a certain degree of reinforcement in this area,probably from the Moscow/Smolensk Sector, where air activity has been on a relatively low scale.India and Burma.52. Targets in the Akyab area were attacked by Allied aircraft, about200 bomber and fighter sorties being engaged in these operations in the area between Katha and Mandalay, railways and river craft werethe objectives for Mohawks (P. 36), Beaufighters and U.S. Mitchells (B. 25);several buildings, locomotives and other rolling stock were damaged.Attacks were made on the airfields at Mingaladon, Toungoo, Shwebo andHeho, but no outstanding results were reported. The bridge at Myitnge (nearMandalay) was attacked by a total of 21 U.S. bombers.At Rangoon, two raids by U.S. Liberators (B. 24) were made on the railwayyards and main station, the latter being hit several times.Night bombing attacks were made on Myochaung and Sagaing (both in thevicinity of Mandalay) and on Magwe.U.S. Kittyhawks (P. 40) operating from China attacked road transport150 miles E.S.E. of Mandalay and to the north of Myitkyina and destroyedbarrack buildings at Lonkin (70 miles W.N.W. of Myitkyina).Escorted enemy bombers made two attacks on our forward positions in theRathedaung area. Our fighters which intercepted destroyed three enemy aircraft and damaged others, and A.A. probably destroyed two more.china.53. On the 11th, enemy aircraft bombed Kweilin and Liuchow, and onthe 15th 25 U.S. bombers attacked Nanking.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.54.
