NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.I. A convoy from the United Kingdom has arrived in North Russian portswithout loss.Air inward bound blockade runner or supply ship has been sunk.Two U-boats have probably been sunk and several others damaged.There has been renewed U-boat activity off South Africa.   Shipping losses have been moderate.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. On the morning of the 26th a U.S. Liberator (B. 24) sighted an 8,000-tontanker, probably an inward bound blockade runner or supply ship, when500 miles S.W. of Cape Finisterre. The ship was shadowed by aircraft untilH.M.S. Sussex sank her by gunfire during the afternoon. Survivors were seen in four lifeboats, but owing to the danger from U-boats they were not picked1 up.3. On the night of the 26th/27th, during an attack by E-boats on a coastalconvoy in Lyme Bay. a Norwegian whaler and an escort trawler were sunk. Atank-landing craft, which was in the convoy, is missing and presumed lost,4. During the night of the 27lh/28th our light forces intercepted a heavilyescorted southbound ship off the Dutch coast. In the ensuing engagement withthe escorts one M.G.B. was lost and the remaining three M.G.Bs. were damaged.5. H.M. Submarine Vandal (P. 64), newly completed, is overdue fromexercises in Home Waters and is presumed lost.Northern Waters.6. A convoy of 22 ships from the United Kingdom arrived in North Russianports during the week without loss. H.M. ships provided cover and escort.Enemy aircraft canned out two unsuccessful attacks on the convoy when nearingits destination.7.   A Russian warship sank an enemy destroyer in the Barents Sea,8. The Norwegian Submarine Uredd is overdue from patrol off theNorwegian coast and is presumed lost.Mediterranean.9. H.M. Submarine Torbay, on patrol off the coast of Corsica, sank three ships and one small craft, details of which are not yet available. On the 14t.lh,H.M. Submarine Thunderbolt sank a small minesweeper in the northern Adriatic.South Atlantic.10. The Dutch submarine depot ship Colombia, escorted by a corvette and aircraft, was torpedoed and sunk off East London on the 27th. There were377 survivors.East Indies.II. On the 21st the Dutch Submarine O. 24 sank a northbound laden motorship of 4,000 tons in the Malacca Straits.Pacific.12. U.S. Submarines, operating in Far Eastern waters, have sunk threecargo ships, a tanker and a schooner. Another tanker and a transport were damaged.Anti-Submarine Operations.13. Forty-three attacks, 28 by surface craft and 15 by aircraft, were carriedout during the week. Two U-boats were probably sunk, four probably damaged and one possibly damaged.On the 24th a Catalina (.P.B.Y.) probably damaged a U-boat west of Lisbon,and on the same day an aircraft from Newfoundland probably damaged a U-boat
in the N.W. Approaches. On the 26th a U-boat was probably damaged by aLiberator (B. 24) N.W. of Finisterre. H.M.C.S. Assiniboine (destroyer) probably sank a U-boat in mid-Atlantic on the 2nd, and on the following day a U-boat was probably damaged by a Wellington in the Bay of Biscay. On the same day an aircraft possibly damaged a U-boat in the S.W. Approaches.In the Mediterranean H.M. Destroyers in co-operation with aircraft probably sank a U-boat off Algiers on the 23rd.&apos;.,.;V:, A,. ^ .   .Enemy Intelligence.German.14. The armed raider which recently put in at Dunkirk was located offCuxhaven on the 28th.Italian.15. Photographic reconnaissance showed the three Littorio class battleshipsat Spezia on the 24th February and again on the 1st March. Photographs showed that the new bows taken from the hull of the unfinished Regolo class cruiser havebeen fitted to the ship of that class damaged in November last and now at Spezia.The 8&quot; cruiser Bolzano, also at Spezia, was seen to have been still furtherdismantled since the 19th February.It is considered that the 6&quot; cruiser Montecuccoli, which was damaged onthe 4th December, has completed her repairs.There was a considerable increase in traffic to Tunisia this, week in com-parison with the week before. Estimated figures for February show a markeddecline in traffic as compared with January and December.Japanese.16. It is considered likely that the quiet period which followed the evacua-tion of Guadalcanal has been used to withdraw some of the Japanese ships fromthe S.W. Pacific to Home Waters for docking and refit.U-boats.17. It is estimated that about 110 U-boats are now operating in the Atlantic,of which 80 are in the N.W. and S.W. Approaches.There is a concentration east of Greenland, and U-boats have been operatingoff the South African coast and off the east coast of Brazil. A number of U-boatsare in Northern Waters on the convoy routes to and from North Russia.In the Mediterranean it is estimated that 61 Italian and 21 German U-boatsare available for operations.Protection of Seaborne Trade.18. During the week ending the 28th February-lst March, 853 ships havebeen convoyed. Of these, 159 were in ocean coiiA^oys and. 694 in British coastal convoys.Sixty-one destroyers (including 12 U.S. destnyyers) and 81 sloops, cuttersand corvettes (including two U.S. cutters) were employed on escort duties.During the week 51 ships in two ocean convoys arrived in Home waters without loss. . ,19. During the week ending the 27th imports into the United kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 594,000 tons, compared with 431,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 484,000 tons during the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports 234,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.20. During the week U-boats are reported to have attacked 11 ships, ofwhich two are believed to have been sunk.An outward bound convoy was attacked south of Durban and six ships were torpedoed. Two ships in a homeward bound convoy were torpedoed in the N.W.Approaches and two ships in an east-bound convoy were torpedoed off theN. African coast. A ship in a U.S. convoy was sunk off Baia (Brazil). One ship in coastal convoy was sunk by E-boats in Lyme Bay.Four ships were bombed, and damaged in Murmansk.[25117] b
A Norwegian ship which was attempting to reach the United Kingdom from southern Norway was bombed and sunk in the North Sea.21. The provisional figure of tonnage lost by enemy action during Februaryis about 268,000 tons, which includes 10 tankers totalling 78,000 tons.British Minelaying.22. During the week surface craft laid mines in the Channel and off theDutch coast. Aircraft minelaying has been carried out in the Baltic, off theDutch and, German North Sea coasts and off the French Channel and biscay ports.In the Mediterranean mines were laid by surface craft and aircraft in theCentral Mediterranean.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping&quot;.23. Minelaying by enemy aircraft was suspected on one night during theweek when six aircraft were operating in the Thames Estuary on the 26th.Two groups of E-boats were operating off the Lizard on the night of the25th/26th and were engaged by shore batteries. Minelaying was suspected and shipping diverted. A sweep which was subsequently carried, out had negativeresults. On the night of the 26th/27th E-boats were seen off Yarmouth andLowestoft and minelaying was suspected, but subsequent sweeps have so far been unsuccessful.Twenty-seven ground mines have been destroyed in Home Waters duringthe week, most of them in the Lowestoft area where E-boats were operating onthe night of the 17th/18th.A total of 16 moored mines has been destroyed in the Strait of Gibraltar.Fifty-two moored mines have been destroyed off Mersa Matruh.The mine totals are : 4,200 ground; 2,260 moored.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map of Tunisia and one showing the&apos;operations in Russia areenclosed as an inset.)The Russo-German Campaign.Northern Sector.24. As a result of heavy fighting, the Germans have been forced to withdraw from the Demyansk salient. The Germans admit a withdrawal but claim that itwas effected according to plan. This may well be true as the present german policy must be to economise forces where possible by withdrawal from awkwardsalients. The Russians are following up, and now appear to be exerting pressureagainst the new German line south of Staraya Russa.The Russians have captured. Rzhev and claim to have freed the Moscow-Rzhev-Velikie Luki railway.Orel-Kursk Sector.25. The Russians are attacking in strength in the Sukhinichi-Mtsenskarea, where they have effected some local penetrations in the German defences,and South of Orel in a north-westerly direction. These attacks are presumablydesigned to pinch out the Orel salient. West of Kursk the Russians are stillmaking progress.Kharkov Sector.26. The Russians have enlarged the Sumy salient south-westward. TheGermans admit that in this area the battle is elastic, which indicates that theyhave not yet been able to effect any measure of stabilisation.Donetz Bend Sector.27. The Germans are counter-attacking strongly against the Krasnograd-Slavyansk salient; the attacks are eastwards in the Krasnograd area, andnorthwards between Lozovaya and Kramatorsk, both of which places they claimto have recaptured.   They also claim to be approaching Isyum.
The Russians are still astride the railway in the Krasnoarmeisk area despiteviolent German counter attacks with tanks and infantry. Although it isimpossible to say where the Germans hope to stabilise their front, last winter&apos;sline is still intact in places and the Germans continue to produce reserves. Theymay, therefore, still regain it.On the River Mius front north of Taganrog there has been heavy fighting,but a severe thaw has impeded operations.Taman Bridgehead.28. There have been further Russian penetrations of German positionsnorth and south of the line Krasnodar-Krymskaya, where operations are being restricted by continuing thaw. The Germans are, however, fighting hard to gaintime to permit orderly evacuation.Summary.20. There are indications that the Russians may have decided to transfertheir main offensive operations to the Orel sector, where winter conditions couldnormally be expected to continue until the end of March. The Germans mean-while appear to be shortening their line where they can on other sectors and tohave concentrated their main effort against the Russian salient north-east ofDnepropetrovsk. A somewhat serious situation for the Russians may have arisen in that area. It is probable that the Russians have not yet been able toget the railways working and are dependent largely on roads much, affected bythaw. If the Germans succeed in eliminating the Krasnograd-Slavyansk salient,the Russian salient west of Kharkov will present a very vulnerable flank, but thesame thaw conditions may well prevent any extensive exploitation by theGermans of their local success.Tunisia.First A rmy.30. Throughout the 22nd and 23rd the enemy continued his attacks in theCentral Sector in the area Djebel el Hambra and south-east of Thala. these attacks were held by U.S. and British troops and armour. By the night of the23rd the ground for two miles to the north-west of the Kasserine Pass was reported clear of the enemy. The next day the enemy continued his withdrawal,leaving the road behind him heavily mined, and early on the morning of the 25thBritish and U.S. forces attacked the pass itself which was occupied with little opposition. The enemy appeared to be falling back to the general line Pichon-Sidi Bouzid-Gafsa. Our advance continued slowly and by the 28th U.S. patrolshad reached the north edge of Sbeitla which we reoccupied on the 1st March.The towns of Kasserine and Feriana have also passed back into our hands. our forward elements are now pressing on south and south-east of Sbeitla. Gafsa isstill occupied by the enemy.On the 26th, the enemy opened a general offensive along the front of the5th Corps putting in a series of attacks in the area of Djebel Mansour-SouArada-Medjez el Bab. His two most dangerous thrusts were at Sidi Nsir,midway between Mateur and Beja, where British positions were overrun; andin the region south of Medjez el Bab, where a tank thrust down the Medjez elBab-El Aroussa road was only halted just north of El Aroussa. Seven enemytanks were destroyed in this fight for the loss of one Churchill.The following day we made successful counter-attacks recapturing some ofof the ground previously lost, and by the 28th the enemy offensive generally hadlessened with the exception of the Mateur-Beja road area where he had gotwithin about ten miles north-east of Beja, On the 1st March the enemy renewedthis attack, but by the end of the day was known definitely to be with-drawing from the area. A total of 18 enemy tanks, including one Mark .VI, was believed to have been destroyed since the beginning of the battle in this sector.Further south, British and U.S. patrols, working the Medjez el Bab-ElAroussa road, captured a quantity of enemy material. Here the enemy has with-drawn into the hills east of the Medjez el Bab-El Aroussa road.Since the beginning of the battle in the 5th Corps sector on the 26th between800 and 900 prisoners of war have been taken, and the 11th Brigade, who havebeen operating in and around Medjez el Bab, claim at least 300 enemy dead alongtheir front in the same period. During the last three days of the offensive theenemy has committed 17 infantry battalions, supported by two or three companies of tanks.   The total number of enemy tanks knocked out is over thirty.[25117] b 2
Eighth Army.31. During the week ending the 4th March the leading armoured and infantry formations of Eighth Army moved forward to the area north and north-west of Medenine. On the southern flank armoured patrols were active betweenHaddada and Khrdache. General Leclerc&apos;s forces, which were pushingnorthwards to the west of the Matmata range of hills, reached Ksar Rhilane.Contact with the enemy was limited during the week to small skirmishes witharmoured cars and spasmodic shelling.Burma.32. There is no change in the situation on the Mayu Peninsula, wherefighting continues. North of Myitkyina, small Japanese forces have advanced inthe direction of Fort Hertz. This movement is being opposed by Burma levies,who have been compelled to withdraw to positions south of Fort Hertz.In a small raid by our patrols landed from launches at Myebon, south-east of Akyab, on the night of the 22nd/23rd, one river steamer and two launches were sunk and the jetty destroyed.   We suffered no casualties.Far East.New Guinea.33. Allied patrols from the Wau area, 30 miles south-west of Salamaua,have advanced to within 2 miles of Mubo, 10 miles south of Salamaua.Solomon Islands.34. The Japanese have withdrawn from Russel Islands, which lie 40 miles to the north-west of Guadalcanal.AIR SITUATION.General Review.35. Strong forces of our bombers were despatched against Berlin, Cologne,St. Nazaire, Hamburg and Nuremberg.An enemy convoy with its air cover and naval escort was successfully attackedoff New Britain.There was considerable activity in Tunisia. Heavy raids were made againstTunis and Bizerta and on targets in Sicily.United Kingdom.36. Enemy activity during daylight consisted of armed reconnaissances by two aircraft on each of four days and a raid by 11 aircraft on Exmouth.&quot;; fourfighter-bombers were shot down by R.A.F. fighters and a fifth was damaged. at night, no enemy aircraft operated overland until the night of the 3rd/4th, whentwo attacks were made on the London area by approximately 30 bombers in eachphase; fighters destroyed one and another was brought down by A.A. gunfire.Germany and Occupied Territory.37. During the month of February, aircraft operating under bomber command, including the U.S. VIIIth  Army Air Force, dropped, approximately11,280 tons of H.E. and incendiaries on enemy and enemy occupied territory.The previous highest monthly total was 6,845 tons in June 1942. The total alsoexceeds by about 1,500 tons the estimated weight of bombs dropped, by the G.A.F.on the United Kingdom in September 1940.Day.38. U.S. heavy bombers operated against Wilhelmshaven and Brest, whichweie attacked by 69 and 62 aircraft respectively. At Wilhelmshaven the bombingis considered, to have been good, some bombs being seen to fall on and near theMarinewerft naval dockyards. From Brest, which was attacked in goodvisibility, no outstanding results are reported. Seven bombers and three of the fighter cover were lost.
The enemy raider at Dunkirk (vide Paragraph 43 of&apos;Resume No. 181) was attacked, by a total of 57 escorted Venturas (B. 34) but, although numerous hits were seen in the dock areas adjacent to the ship, no hits are claimed. Escort,cover and diversionary sweeps were provided by 52 squadrons of Spitfires, whichin combat destroyed three enemy fighters, probably destroyed three more and damaged four for the loss of three aircraft.Mosquitoes made four effective low-level raids. At Rennes. the Naval storagedepot was attacked by 12 of these aircraft, several large explosions and numerousflashes, possibly from exploding ammunition, being seen (see also Appendix VI).Nine Mosquitoes bombed the Flotation Plant of the Molybdenum Mines at Knaben(40 miles E. of Stavanger); debris was seen to be blown to a considerable heightand the plant was left enveloped in smoke. The remaining targets were theengineering and Diesel Works at Hengelo and the Cockerill Steel and ArmamentWorks at Liege; at the former, hits were seen on the diesel motor store and on the engine erecting and machine shops. From these operations four Mosquitoes are missing.Attacks on communications in Holland, Belgium and Northern France by fighters and fighter-bombers, of which two are missing, resulted in the destructionof four locomotives and damage to 19, and damage to 14 barges, a trawler, a tugand a power station. Escorted fighter-bombers also made four attacks onMaupertus airfield near Cherbourg.Night.39. In a week of heavy raiding, Bomber Command despatched a total of1,948 aircx^aft against land objectives, the five principal targets being :  Des-! patched.Attacked.Tonnage.H.E.I.B.HeavyBombs.Missing.Crashed.Berlin ...CologneSt. NazaireHamburgNuremberg302(Heavies427437417337(Heavies)239372409342278321489522415340289525595481384Lb.x 8,000x 4,000x 8,000141 x 4,0004 x 8,000x 4,000x 8,000145 x 4,0004 x 8,000.135 x 4,0001285160117105109On the night of 1st/2nd Berlin received its heaviest attack of the war.Operating under favourable weather conditions, with only a slight ground haze,our aircraft were able to effect a good concentration of bombing around the targetindicators, which were punctually and accurately dropped. Many very large fires were seen over the whole ai^ea, particularly in the centre, east and south-east of the city. Assessment of damage, from photographs taken on the 3rd, is referred to in Appendix VI.At Cologne, weather conditions were similar to those at Berlin, except for a somewhat thicker ground haze. Owing, however, to the late arrival of the Path-finder force, some aircraft bombed before the target was illuminated, and thisresulted in scattered fires, but later, aided by flares and target indicators, a moreconcentrated attack developed. Two particularly large fires were seen and oneheavy explosion, in the centre of the city, was reported.Heavy cloud was encountered en route to St. Nazaire, but the target itself was clear, although a smoke screen and haze made it difficult to recognise grounddetail. From the number of large fires reported in the docks and town, crewswere confident of a successful operation, which was completed in thirty minutes.At Hamburg, observation was hampered to some extent by darkness andsmoke, but, as at St. Nazaire, the Pathfinder force operated punctually andaccurately. Bombing appears to have been fairly well concentrated in an areaabout one mile west of the centre of the Old Town and there was a concentration of fires, including a particularly large one, in the north part of the Old Town.Another large fire in the dock area gave rise to thick, black, oily smoke, and reportsalso mentioned two large explosions.
The attack on Nuremberg on the night of 25th/26th February was notsuccessful, as photographs, taken on the 2nd March, cover the target area butreveal no major damage.On six nights a total of 28 Mosquitoes, employing blind-bombing technique,were despatched against Aachen and targets in the Ruhr. Intruders operatingover France and \he Low Countries destroyed a Do. 217 and damaged fourlocomotives&apos;.Thirty-seven aircraft of Bomber Command and 20 of Army Co-operationCommand were despatched to drop leaflets over French towns.Coastal Operations..  40.   No attacks on enemy surface craft have been reported.A Beaufighter on patrol oil&apos; the Norwegian coast destroyed one Ju. 88 and damaged another.Two hundred and ninety-four aircraft of Bomber Command and 12 NavalSwordfish laid 636 sea mines in enemy waters. Seven aircraft are missing fromthese operations and two crashed.Mediterranean.41. During intensive activity by Allied aircraft in Tunisia and against objectives in Sicily and Italy, the following combat casualties have beenreported :  probably destroyed.    Destroyed.      Damaged..Enemy      ......... 75 24 59Allied       ......... 49 ... 29On one day, a total of 772 sorties was flown, of which 521 were by aircraftbased in French North Africa.French. North Africa.42. Aggressive and sustained attacks were carried out in all sectors bvAllied fighters and bombers of all types.In the Northern Sector. A total of 95 tons of bombs was released duringtwo raids by escorted Fortresses (B. 17) on harbours and shipping at Tunis andLa Gouiette; hits were made on a pow7er house and bombs fell among shipyardsand in the dry dock area, Nineteen Fortresses (B. 17), with fighter cover, droppedfragmentation bombs on the airfield at El Aouina, Wellingtons attacked Bizertaon two nights, dropping a total of 36 tons of bombs; escorted Fortresses (B. 17)bombed the same target by clay.Waves of medium and1 fighter-bombers carried out damaging attacks, fromlow levels, on enemy tanks and transport along the road from Mateur, and ontroops, gun-positions, road and rail jimctions and other objectives in the Pontdu Fahs/Pichon, Medjez-el-Bab, Sidi Nsir and Beja areas.Enemy offensive activity on this front declined during the week. attacks were made north of Bou Arada, also in the Teboursouk/Aroussa district, and onthe Souk-el-Khemis/Thirbar road, but much of his air effort was defensive.In the Southern Sector. The Allied offensive gained momentum. In theGabes area, heavy, medium and fighter-bombers intensified their raids on troop concentrations and on landing grounds at El Hamma, Bordji Toual, Oudref, BouChemma. Methouia and Gabes where, in an attack&quot; by Wellingtons, 45 tons of bombs were dropped and 10 aircraft set on fire. Railways between. Sousse andSfax were the targets for medium bombers; Marauders (B. 26). in a low-levelattack, destroyed the railway bridge at La Hencha. Enemy positions in theMareth area were harassed by Bostons (A. 20), Baltimores (A. 30) andMitchells (B. 25); 59 tons of bombs were dropped by Halifaxes and Wellingtonsin an attack on M.T. north-west of the town. Large fires were started by Bisleysat Sbeitla and at Gafsa, where the railway station was hit.Allied advanced lartding-grounds were attacked on six occasions but, exceptfor five Kittyhawks (P. 40) damaged on the ground at Nefatia, no success was achieved. During one of several attempted raids on Hazbub (4 miles south-east of Medenine), two of the three attacking aircraft (Italian M.C. 202) were destroyed.Tripolitania.43.   Nightly attacks by Ju. 88s on Tripoli harbour were ineffective.
Sicily and Southern Italy.44. Escorted Fortresses (B. 17) carried out two attacks on Cagliari,dropping a total of 166 tons of bombs; a large steamer, jetties, railway installa-tions and a number of industrial buildings were bit. The same type of aircraftreleased 82 tons on Palermo, and a further 60 tons were dropped during two night attacks by Wellingtons and Halifaxes resulting in large fires being started in the docks and town. Liberators (B. 24) bombed Naples on two days; 26 tons fell inthe target area and bursts were seen in the docks and on the railway station.Seventeen tons of bombs were dropped at Messina harbour by Liberators (B. 24);results were obscured by cloud.Comiso airfield, was raided with good effect on three occasions by bomb-carrying Spitfires. At Syracuse they sank a steamer and bombed the airfield and railway yards and, in an attack on the power station at Cassabile, obtained manyhits in the target area. The landing-ground on Lampedusa Island was also attacked.Twenty Fortresses (B. 17), despatched against shipping north of Sicily, sank one vessel, believed to be a tanker, and set fire to three other ships in the convoy.Other aircraft damaged two ships in the Gulf of Taranto. A westbound convoynorth of Palermo, previously sighted by aircraft, was attacked by Wellingtonsand Beauforts from Malta; a 7,000-ton ship was torpedoed and set on fire.&quot; Intruders,&quot; from Malta, operated over Sicily every night dispersal a reason the airfields at Sciacca and Comiso, railway junctions at Termini and SanStefano di Camastra, a bridge at Cefalu and two laimches off Marsala wereamong the many targets successfully attacked.Russia.45. Russian air operations, during the week ended the. 2nd. March, were confined chiefly to the Western Caucasus, with some activity in the Ukraine, inthe region of Demyansk, and in the Far NorthIn the Caucasus, when weather conditions permitted, they maintainedpersistent raids with small forces directed, against German troops, communications and coastal towns. Novorossisk and Anapa were attacked, as also were Taman,and Kerch in the Crimea. Two German ships of 14,000 and 8,000 tons respec-tively are claimed to have been sunk. In the Ukraine attacks were made onStalino North airfield and. on airfields in the area of Kramatorskaya. In the region of Denryansk, ground-attack aircraft operated during the russian advance. German raids on Murmansk, during the week, called for defensivefighter operations in the Far North.In the main, however, there was a decrease in Russian air activity. Theyclaim that, during the week ended the 27th February, they destroyed 168 german aircraft for the loss of 87 of their own a considerable decrease in successesclaimed as compared with the previous week. The reduction in effort thusindicated was to be expected in view of the unsuitable flying weather, particularlyin the South.During the period, ended the 3rd March, the German effort appears to havebeen mainly concentrated in the Central sector, in the Kharkov-Kursk area andin the region between the Donetz and Dneiper basins. The enemy claimedconsiderable fighter successes, which were probably confined to the Central sector.Attacks in the Murmansk area continued and it was reported that dive-bombersdestroyed railway installations and rolling-stock near the harbour.Burma.46. Objectives in the Rathedaung-Akyab area were attacked by a total of60 Blenheims with Hurricanes as escort; two of the latter are missing.Hurricanes also attacked small craft off the Arakan coast.In the Mandalay area, U.S. bombers attacked and probably damaged theGokteik Viaduct, hit a bridge at Myitnge and damaged the main line and sidingsat Thazi.   Thazi was also bombed, at night, by Wellingtons.In the Myitkyina area, U.S. Kittyhawks (P. 40) destroyed a bridge atTiangzup, damaged a bridge at Pinbawr. bombed objectives in the HukongValley and effectively attacked an enemy supply depot. Myitkyina itself and a supply depot near Lungling were bombed by escorted U.S. Mitchells (B. 25).Near Katha. rolling-stock was attacked and damaged by Mohawks (P. 36).and villages in the Mytttha Valley were bombed by Blenheims.U.S. Liberators (B. 24) hit and probably sank a 7,000-ton ship in the gulf of Martaban.Small-scale night bombing attacks were made on Rangoon, Toungoo, Akyab,Moulmein and Sagaing.
Pacific Zone.New Guinea.47. US. bombers made four attacks on the airfield and other objectives atLae and also bombed the airfields at Finsehafen, Alexishafen and Wewak.Enemy positions in the Mubo area were bombed and machine-gunned by U.S.Bostons (A. 20), and Labu (near Lae) was attacked by four U.S. Mitchells (B. 25).Two small ships, in the harbours of Alexishafen and Wewak respectively,were hit and damaged by U.S. aircraft.Kai Islands.48.   Five Hudsons (A. 29) attacked and damaged buildings at Toeal.Timor.49. Koepang airfield was attacked by eight Beaufighters; four bombers and nine fighters on the ground were destroyed and a further nine aircraft were damaged.New Britain area.50. On the 2nd, a convoy of eight ships with six naval escorts and. aircraft was attacked to the north of Rook Island by 27 U.S. heavy bombers escorted by16 Lightnings (P. 38). Two merchantmen were sunk, a third when last seen haddecks awash, a fourth and a destroyer were damaged and of the escorting aircraftfive were destroyed and eight probably destroyed. That evening, the remnantof the convoy joined another at the north-western end of the Vitiaz Straits. next day the convoy, which then consisted of ten merchantmen and five destroyers, was attacked in the Huon Gulf area by a total of 87 escorted bombers. A nightreconnaissance found only one burning cargo ship and one stationary destroyerafloat. In combat during the day 40 enemy fighters were destroyed and 15 were probably destroyed. Allied losses were one Fortress (B. 17) and three Lightnings(P. 38). -U.S. heavy bombers made several small-scale attacks on Gasmata airfield and also attacked the harbour at Rabaul where a sea-plane tender may have been damaged.  A small ship in Wide Bay was sunk by a U.S. Liberator (B. 24).HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.51. The only incident worthy of note was at Exmouth, which was bombed and machine-gunned on the 26th February.   There were 25 fatal casualties.By Night.52. On the 2nd/3rd March, some 60 shells were fired by enemy coastalbatteries on Folkestone, Ramsgate and intermediate towns. Folkestone Harbourstation was damaged.On the 3rd/4th, bombs were dropped for an hour before midnight and again in the early morning over Outer London and widely scattered in East Anglia andthe Home Counties, and in the second period mainly along the Thames Estuary.Electricity supply and railway services were locally interrupted and an A.A. shellcaused extensive damage to an oil container on the Isle of Grain; elsewhere no serious damage has been reported. Of 20 fires in the London area only one was still alight in the morning.Casualties from bombs or A.A. shells were light.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. in combining the figures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form. The figures for non-tankers relateto the last day of the month while those for tankers relate to the 15th of the month to February 1942 and to the last day of the month from March 1942.    -.. (1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in January 1943 these comprised 31 tankers of 252,000 gross tons.(6) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column. All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included,(c) A part of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3) ).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and EireOO

Photographs taken on the 19th February show that in additionto damage previously reported, damage to buildings in plants making telephone and telegraph equipment, milling and grinding machines, cables and electricproducts, has been caused. Damage has also been caused to several unidentifiedfactories, in particular at Neukoln where, among other damage, six acres ofindustrial buildings have been destroyed by fire. Many incidents of damage to residential property and blocks of flats are seen in the southern districts.Photographs taken on the 3rd March cover most of the city except for a stripin the middle from north-west to south-east. A brief preliminary examinationshows considerable fresh damage including about 20 acres of railway workshopsat Tempelhof destroyed, dock-sheds on Becken 3 destroyed and damage toKlockner Humboldt Deutz Works. Industrial buildings in WilmersdorhSchmargendorf, Schoneberg and Jungfernheide are either destroyed or damaged.The Deutschland Halle and part of the Moabit Prison are gutted. Manyscattered incidents of residential damage can be seen and some buildings are still burning.Wilhelmshaven. Photographs reveal, in addition to the damage previously reported (i) Damage by fire and H.E. to the Naval base and dockyard, where shedsand stores have been hit.(ii) Similar damage in the commercial harbour.(iii) Numerous sheds throughout the dock area have been destroyed or damaged.(iv) Three incidents in Markt Strasse on the north-west side of the railway station have caused destruction of business and residential propertyover an area of 7 acres,(v) Sixty-five to seventy buildings in the centre of the town have been destroyed or severely damaged.(Correction. The area of destruction at the main ammunitiondepot at Mariensiel is 118 acres and not 150 acres as previously stated.)Cloud and a smoke-screen render interpretation of small-scale photographs taken during the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 28th February difficult. Bursts can,however, be seen on or near the U-boat harbour, the barracks for U-boat crews,the naval clothing store and the main station.Hamburg. A reliable source reports that during the attack on the3rd/4th February damage was caused to the Steinwarcler end of the Elbe Tunnel.Casualties to H.M.

Italy.Milan. The Alfa Romeo, Pirelli and General Electric Works are among those damaged, and, in addition, in the suburbs some 30 other industrial concernswere hit. Renewal of panic scenes and further evacuation resulted in temporarychaos on the electric suburban lines of the Nord railway, which carry the bulk ofthe working population to and from the city. Official casualties 450 killed and1,200 wounded. The population are dispirited at the fact that the much-advertised German flak has not in any way reduced the efficacy of R.A.F. attacks.France.Morlaix. Photographs taken on the 21st February show that damage caused to the viaduct must have been more extensive than was at first thought and thatthe temporary repairs effected were of no avail. It is seen that the tracks havenow been removed from the viaduct for a distance of 530 ft,, over two-thirds of thetotal length. Repair work is seen to be in progress, and it seems possible that the base of the first pier at the eastern end received a direct hit.Brest.
