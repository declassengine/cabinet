THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC majesty  &apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet    February 1943.MOST SECRET. Copy No. IV/.P. (43) 69.February 17, 1943.TOBE KEPT UNDER  LOCK  AND  key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.POLAND.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a memorandum summarising the views expressed to me and, to certain British officials by a representative of the PolishUnderground Movement now in this country. I would draw my colleagues&apos;attention to the specially secret nature of this information and of the channelthrough which it has been obtained.A. E.Foreign Office,February 17, 1943.A REPRESENTATIVE of the important Polish underground movement,who has been sent to enter into contact with the Polish Government, is at presentin this country. He. left Warsaw in October. He has been seen by a number ofBritish officials upon whom he made an excellent impression; and at GeneralSikorskEs suggestion I had a talk with him myself on the 4th February. It maybe of interest to my colleagues if I circulate trie following information regardingconditions in Poland which has been gleaned from this man.He was sent to this country by the leaders of the underground movement in poland to acquaint the Polish Government with their views regarding thesituation in Poland and the policy that should be followed. It appears that hewas also commissioned to bring back to Warsaw information about the standing and activities of the Polish Government in exile, although it is no longer certainthat he will return to Poland.As regards General SikorskEs Government, this Pole stated that the Polesin Poland recognise the necessity of having a Government abroad as a symboland to maintain, the continuity of the Polish. State. So long as the german occupation lasted, no one had any idea of setting up a rival Government in Polandunless General Sikorski were to cede territory to the U.S.S.R., in which case anational Government would be set up on the lines of the revolutionary Governmentof 1863. There was likely to be no difficulty in the way of members of GeneralSikorskEs Government returning to Poland after the war, but it was improbable that the Poles in Poland who had borne the brunt of the German persecutionwould confirm them all in office.He made it plain that Polish resistance to German penetration of theircountry is still strong and successful. In Warsaw Germans remain as much out-side the life of the town as three years ago. The whole Polish population ofWarsaw, including the remaining Jews, is united not merely in hatred of theGermans but also in resistance. Active resistance is conducted by a small numberof picked men and women, who succeed under great difficulties in extending their11972   [25057]
activities all over the country, even into those territories which have been incorporated in the German Reich. The efficiency of their organisation is provedby the fact that for over a year the German authorities have abandoned hope ofpenetrating it, The intensification of the German persecution in recent months has not impaired either the solidarity of the Polish nation or the enterprise anddaring of the underground organisation. As regards the political situation, myinformant said that the four principal parties which support General SikorskPsGovernment the Socialist, Peasant, National Democrat and Labour parties-r-were working harmoniously together in Poland.From what he said it is clear that the Polish underground movement isquickly and promptly informed of developments in the outside world, and thatthe underground press is up to date and has a wide circulation. For news the organisers of the underground movement and of the press rely mainly upon theHome Service of the B.B.C.. which they regard as more reliable than the variousEuropean &quot; propaganda &quot; services of the B.B.C.As regards the Soviet Union, he stated that the Poles in Poland regarded thePolish-Soviet Treaty of the 30th July, 1941, as indispensable for the generalAllied cause. Although very ready to listen to our arguments, he was not,however, prepared to accept what he termed the optimistic view held in thiscountry that the Russians sincerely desired a strong and independent Poland as distinct from a Poland dominated by the Soviet Union. He said there was nodoubt that the Soviet Government were encouraging the small Polish CommunistParty and the new Polish Workers&apos; Party to act exclusively in the Soviet interest,e.g., to stage premature risings and to spy on and hamper the official Polish under-ground movement. Although Soviet parachutists had been introduced intoPolish territory, they had carefully refrained from fighting against the Germans,but had merely incited the local population, and so encouraged German reprisals.In these circumstances, the Poles could not regard Soviet poli cy as that of aloyal ally.
