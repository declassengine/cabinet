THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 81.February 23, 1943.INDIA.HOME   MEMBERSHIP  OF   GOVERNOR-GENERAL&apos;S  EXECUTIVECOUNCIL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate for the consideration of the War Cabinet the Viceroy&apos;personal telegram No. 505-S of the 20th February, which raises the questionof the succession to Sir Reginald Maxwell, Home Member of the Governmentof India, whose normal tenure of office expires on the 4th April next.Sir Reginald. Maxwell is one of the three remaining official members of theGovernor-General&apos;s Council.Since August 1940 our policy has been, as opportunity arose, to appointunofficial Indians to the Executive Council. The vacancy in the Home Member-ship in April next raises the question whether this policy should be continuedto the point of selecting an Indian to fill the key position of Home Member. this could be done within the existing statutory requirement that there shall be three Members who have served for 10 years under the Crown in India as sir Muhammad Usman has recently acquired that qualification. It would, Ithink, in any case have been open to question whether the Inclianisation of theHome Membership was desirable when we are within 9 months of the arrival ofa new Viceroy. But, in view of the resignations of three Indian non-official members of the Viceroy&apos;s Council and of the fact that there may be difficultissues to be faced in the sphere of Law and Order during the next 12 months,the Viceroy feels that the best course will be to offer Sir Reginald Maxwell anextension of one year until April 1944. I am satisfied myself that in thecircumstances this is the right course, and I support the Viceroy&apos;s recommendation for the approval of the War Cabinet.The Viceroy has not yet made up bis mind as to how the three portfolioswhich have been vacated would best be filled. It may be possible, for a time,to combine one of them with one of the other existing portfolios, but even so itmay be necessary to appoint an official to one of these vacancies.L. S. A.India Office,February 23, 1943.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, datedthe 20th February, 1943.505-S. Personal. Term of office of Maxwell, my Home Member, expires on 4th April and we must now take a decision as to what is then to be done.Alternatives are to extend or reappoint Maxwell for a further period, or to select a non-official.2. I have had this much in my mind for many months past and I have beenopen as regards the selection of a non-official, Sir Muhammad Usman having[25076]Copy No.WAR CABINET.
occurred to me as a possible. He is reliable, stout-hearted and would, I am certaingive full support over matters of intelligence and services, as well as being entirelysound in the constitutional field.3. On the other hand, Usman has himself most strongly urged me against any further -Indianisation. It would, he says (? corrupt group), be very ill(corrupt group) by Jinnah (not that that matters very much.) (? and) deprive us of one of very few remaining cards in our hand; and I have myself been greatlyshaken by the failure of Members (&apos;? of my) Council of such standing asMody. Aney and Sarkar to stand up to opposition over Gandhi&apos;s fast and bytheir running out in face of a threat of this nature. It is too early yet to judge of long-term consequences of that failure or of any other resignations that mayfollow in the event of Gandhi&apos;s death. But I am quite clear in my own mind that I could not advise His Majesty&apos;s Government in face of it to take the risks involved in appointing a non-official to be Home Member in presentcircumstances.4. My own judgment is that we should reappoint Maxwell on the under-standing that he will not be asked in normal way to stay on for more than a yearI have reason to believe that he would be ready to serve if it was put to him asa matter of public duty, and I shall be ready so to put it. He has great experience and much wisdom, and while his health has always been frail I would hope thathe could stand the extra term. But were he to refuse or to be unable to standextra term, I should then feel it my duty to advise His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat he should be succeeded by a European member of the Indian Civil Service.We need not, however, examine that contingency at the present stage.5. I ought, perhaps, to acid, in case question is raised in Cabinet, that whileRaismaifs tenure as Finance Member does not expire until April 1944, so thatappointment of his successor would take place during next Viceroyalty, my ownconsidered view is that that portfolio also ought to continue to be held for afurther term by an official, and preferably, I would have said, by reappointmentof Raisman, who has clone very well in it.6. I would be grateful for earliest reply that you can with convenience let me have, as Maxwell&apos;s arrangements will, of course, be affected.
