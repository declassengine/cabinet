THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 73.February 18, 1943.Copy No.TO  BE  KEPT under  LOCK  AND  key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.ITALIAN PRISONERS OF WAR.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.REPORTS from the Italian Prisoner of War Camps in this country, in africa, and, above all, in India, show that during the last few months there hasbeen a considerable increase in the number of officers and men who areantagonistic to the Fascist regime. It is legitimate to assume that the increasingantagonism is in proportion to the decrease of faith in an Italian victory.2. The Political Warfare Executive, who are responsible for propaganda to Italian prisoners of war in India, have had a mission in that country sincethe late autumn of 1941. The mission has a special camp at Jaipur, where two hundred officers and a thousand men who are vouched to be 100 per cent, anti-Facscist are segregated, and I have recently sanctioned an extension of this campto accommodate an additional three thousand anti-Fascist prisoners of war.I have also approved a scheme, recommended by the Commander-in-Chief,India, whereby these prisoners of war are to be formed into special Labourbattalions under their own leaders. It is proposed that they shall wear a uniformof British design with the words Italia Redenta (&quot; Italy redeemed &quot;) on the rightsleeve above the green, white and red stripe.3. The question now arises how far is it desirable to apply this scheme toother territories holding Italian prisoners of war.The number of Italian prisoners of war now in British hands is approxi-mately 274,000.   These prisoners are located as follows :  Great BritainIndia  ...British East AfricaMiddle East  ...South Africa ...AustraliaVarious localities38,00068,00060,00032,00070,0005,0001,000Arrangements have been made to send 40,000 more prisoners of war to Britain.Some of these are already on their way.4. Three advantages are to be gained from the formation of theseanti-Fascist Labour battalions : (i) In view of the shortage of man-power they have a utilitarian value.(ii) They have a distinct propaganda value.    Properly publicised, theformation of anti-Fascist battalions will hearten the peoples of the occupied countries, will encourage Italian soldiers to desert, willstrengthen anti-Fascist sentiment in Italy, and will add to the troublesof the Fascists.(iii) If at any time it is considered desirable to form anti-Fascist militarybattalions, these Labour units could be quickly converted.11973   [25058]
5 Some o-roundwork has been done by the Political Warfare Executiveajiiona Italian prisoners of war in this country. The Executive has no missions in the other territories where there is no segregation of Fascists and anti-Fascists,although in these camps, too, the same psychological changes in attitude have beennoted. South Africa is a special problem, because the prisoners there are underthe control of the Union military authorities.6 On the grounds both of utility and of propaganda value, Great Britainand British East Africa would seem to have prior claims, and I therefore recommend that the scheme be extended to both these territories.-  A. E.Foreign Office, February 18, 1943.
