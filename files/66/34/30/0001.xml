The War Office desire to make use under the Defence Regulations, as a training-area for tank formations, of some 100,000 acres of the Yorkshire Wolds. The reasons which impel me to put forward a proposal, the serious effects of which on agricultural production I fully realize, are set out in the following paragraphs. ..,&apos; -2. There arc at present in this country five British armoured divisions, two Canadianarmoured divisions and a Polish armoured division, which is the equivalent in armourof two British divisions. One of these divisions may be going abroad in the near futureleaving seven divisions for which training facilities are required. The divisions are allfully equipped or will shortly be so: large and suitable areas for their collective trainingare essential.3. At present such training areas exist on Salisbury Plain, on the South Downsand at Thetford. The two Canadian divisions are trained on the South Downs andThetford provides for one division. On Salisbury Plain one division, the Guards Division,is at present training. But if American armoured divisions come to this country during the course of the year, the Salisbury Plain area may have to be handed overto them. There is thus a deficiency of training areas for at least three divisions (orlour divisions if the Polish division is regarded as the equivalent of two) and possibly for more if the Americans arrive during the course of the present year.4. The position has changed since the acquisition of the South Downs area in1941. At that time, although there were seven armoured divisions in the making only three were ready for collective training; now seven will be ready for such training in the spring or early summer of this year, apart from the Americans. It is, therefore, urgently necessary to provide facilities where collective training can be carried out. .5. Suitable areas for such training must have certain characteristics; they must beof sufficient size to permit of full deployment and manoeuvre; they must be sufficientlyfirm to carry the weight of tanks; they must be reasonably free of rocky outcrops;they must be undulating, but not too steep; there must be adequate quartering accom-modation nearby, hand having these characteristics is not easy to find in this countryand unfortunately is almost certain to be of a fairly high agricultural quality. Moreover,the use for training purposes cannot be reconciled with its continued use for agricultural purposes. After extensive reconnaissance throughout the Kingdom, including suchlocalities as the Scottish moors, the Yorkshire moors, Dartmoor, Exmoor, the Penninecountry and the Welsh Hills, the most suitable, indeed the only suitable, area of the sizerequired, is in the Wolds, and it is accordingly proposed to make use under the defence regulations of 100,000 acres in this district. Three armoured divisions are stationedconveniently near.
6. The War Office have endeavoured by every means to avoid asking for additional land and to provide the necessary facilities in other ways. It has been considered,tor example, whether armoured formations might be moved from one area to anotherfor their collective training or personnel of armoured divisions could be interchangedwithout the move of equipment, the division coining into a training area taking overthe equipment there from the unit moving out. But these devices would not unfortunate-nalelv inert the case. A move of armoured formations with their vehicles would involvetime and a very heavy strain on the railways and would require an extravagant useof petrol and rubber for the wheeled portion of die formations concerned; the inter-change of personnel would mean a risk of inadequate maintenance of the vehicles,faulty maintenance training of the crews and the training of crews on types which theywould not actually man in battle.7. The War Office arc, therefore, driven to the demand for additional land. It isclear that to ask for 100,000 acres of good agricultural land can only be justified iffrom an operational point of view the lack of such land may seriously affect the courseof military operations. That in fact is the case. The experience of the present war has shown the serious results of putting armoured formations into battle without their being fully trained and the complete interdependence of efficient training and highmorale. The Malayan campaign, for example, showed in the clearest light the needin general for the highest possible standard of training; experience in the Middle Easthas emphasized that lesson in regard to armoured formations by specific evidence thatif such formations have not had collective training they may be unfit on landing to beput into the battle line. They must, therefore, either be risked in battle before theyare fit or be kept back from battle when there is urgent need for them. The armoured divisions now in this country may be wanted for engagement with the Germans inEurope, and may play a decisive part there. To send them imperfectly trained is likelyto result in avoidable casualties in men and equipment and even in operational disaster.8. The use of land for military training is obtained by applying either defence regulation 51 or Defence Regulation 52. Under the former regulation, the land isrequisitioned and the military have the right to sole use and possession. Under thelatter regulation, the right to use land for military purposes is obtained without dispos-sessing the- owner or occupier; this regulation is normally applicable to the less intensiveforms of military training, where normal use of the land may be expected to continueside by side with military user. But, where armoured training is concerned, it is unlikely that any use of the land for continued agricultural production will be practicable.Compensation under Defence Regulation 51 is on the basis of payments akin torent, plus making good damage at the end of the occupation. Under Defence Regula-tion 52, it consists of meeting claims on a Common Law basis for damage caused.I should propose that the question of which regulation is used, if the Cabinet approvemy proposal, should be settled in consultation with the Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries.9. It is for the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs that I ask for theauthority of the War Cabinet to proceed with the proposal in paragraph 5 above, to utilise 100,000 acres of the Yorkshire Wolds as an armoured formation training area.P.
