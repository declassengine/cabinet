Ships in theMediterranean.Shipping losses have again been small.One U-boat has been sunk and three probably sunk.There has been increased Japanese activity in the S.W. Pacific.Northern Waters.2. A convoy of 11 ships from N. Russia sailed from Kola Inlet on the29th January for Iceland (C) and the U.K. It was attacked by two U-boats onthe 3rd February, when 150 miles E. of Jan Mayen Island, one ship beingtorpedoed.  H.M. ships provided escort and cover for the convoy.3.

Welshman (fast minelayer), on passage from Malta to Alexandria,was hit by two torpedoes from a U-boat when off Tobruk on the 1st. Welshmansank after four hours, and the escorting destroyers picked up six officers, includingthe captain, and 112 ratings.7. On the nights of 29th and 30th enemy E-boats, minelaying oil&apos; Bone, were engaged and driven off by our M.T.Bs. Four M.T.Bs. from Malta on the night of the 31st engaged and damaged an F-boat (tank landing craft) off the Tunisiancoast.8.   A convoy of four ships from Malta arrived at Alexandria on the 1st.9.

Submarines have reported the following attacks : Saracen (P. 247), off Naples on the 20th, sank a schooner which was usedfor reporting aircraft.Unruffled (P. 46) sank a 2.000-ton ship off Sousse and a small tanker, aschooner, and a caique off the Tunisian coast during January.Rorqual shelled and damaged a railway bridge on the south coast of Italyon the 29th.10. It is estimated that during the week some 18,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or damaged by our aircraft.French North Africa.II. During the two months ending the 8th January, 1,303,000 dead-weighttonnage was discharged, and 437,000 personnel and 42,420 vehicles were landed atFrench North African ports. This is exclusive of the first landings at Oran andBone, for which no records are at present available.West Africa.12. The French cruiser Georges Leygues left Dakar for patrol on the 28thand the destroyers Le Fantasque and Le Terrible arrived at Casablanca fromDakar.
Black Sea.13. Russian torpedo aircraft have sunk two medium-sized ships and naval aircraft have attacked small craft in Kerch harbour and sunk four barges and four R-boats.Enemy shipping convoys between Roumanian ports and the Crimea haveincreased recently.Pacific.14. U.S. submarines, operating in Far Eastern waters, are reported,by the Navy Department to have sunk six Japanese ships. These include onedestroyer, one large tanker, and four medium-sized cargo ships. Anotherdestroyer was damaged.Anti-Subniarine Operations.15. The U.S. destroyer Babbitt probably sank a U-boat W. of Iceland (C)on the 28th.On the night of the 29th, H.M.N.Z. Trawlers Kiwi and Mou destroyed a japanese U-boat which was carrying troops. The U-boat was engaged withgunfire off Guadalcanal Island, rammed and driven ashore, where she was left aburnt-out wreck.  One Japanese officer was taken prisoner.H.M. Ships Clare (destroyer) and Londonderry (sloop) probably sank a U-boatin the N.W. Approaches on the 3rd, when escorting a homeward-bound convoy:Londonderry was damaged, by a premature depth charge explosion and four ofher ship&apos;s company are missing. H.M.C.S. Collingtvood (corvette) also made a promising attack during the night.A Cataliiia damaged a U-boat S.W. of Bathurst on the 30th.Enemy Intelligence.German.16. It is believed that the Lutzoiv is still in Alten Fiord and the Nurnbergin Narvik.   Tirpitz, Hipper and Jioln are believed to be at Trondheirn.Italian.17. The report that two 6-inch cruisers were damaged at Naples on the4th December, and another sunk, has now been confirmed by P.R.U. Furtherphotographs show that one 6-inch cruiser is under repair at Genoa and the otherat Naples.There has been a slight decrease in the traffic from Italy to Tunisia duringthe past week.Japanese..18. Thei&apos;e has been a good deal of activity during the past week. convoys and transports have been observed in the Bougainville area.There are believed to be 10 Japanese U-boats operating off GuadalcanalIsland.U-boats.19. It is believed that over 100 U-boats are now operating, over half ofwhich are in the North Atlantic. There is a concentration south of Greenland,and there has been some activity in the N.W. Approaches, S.W. of the Azores, and between the Canary Islands and the African coast.Protection of Seaborne Trade.20; During the week ending the 31st January/1st February, 847 ships havebeen convoyed. Of these 218 were in ocean convoys and 629 in British coastal convoys. One ocean boarding vessel, 52 destroyers (including eight US.destroyers), and 77 sloops, cutters and corvettes (including three U.S. cutters),were employed on escort duties, during the week 100 ships in three ocean convoys arrived in home waters;one ship was sunk.[24992]   &apos; b
MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this Resume asan inset.)The Russo-German Campaign.Upper Don Sector.28. The Russians, in close pursuit of the German withdrawal from theVoronezh bridgehead, have advanced steadily astride the railway Voronezh-21. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 29th totalled 318,000 tons, compared with 352,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 437,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Of theweek&apos;s imports 139,000 tons were mineral oils of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.22. During the week U-boats were reported to have attacked six ships, ofwhich four are believed to have been sunk.A home ward-bound convoy from Canada was attacked- on two successivenights while beyond the range of our shore-based aircraft. Two ships, including a tanker, were sunk. On the third day attacks by U-boats were driven off by theescorting aircraft and warships.One ship was sunk in a US. convoy from Newfoundland to Greenland&apos; andone in the S.W. Pacific off Noumea.Two ships are reported torpedoed, one in a convoy from N. Russia and theother in mid-Atlantic, independently routed from Fieetown to St. Johns (N.B.).23. The provisional figure of tonnage lost by enemy action during Januaryis about 202,000 tons, with the possibility of an additional 20,000 tons for latenotifications.British minelaying.24. Aircraft laid mines in the Kattegat, the German Bight, and off theBiscay ports.Mines were also laid in the Mediterranean by surface and aircraft.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.25. On the nights of the 27th/28th and 28th/29th minelaying aircraft were operating in the Thames Estuary, and later in the week were reported off the humber. A few aircraft, possibly minelaying, were operating off the Faroes on the night of the 31st/1st.Surface craft may have laid mines off Dungeness.Six ground mines were destroyed in the Humber and two off Harwich.The  mine  totals,   including  those  destroyed  in  foreign  waters,   are:4,144 ground; 2,165 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.26. Shipments of Spanish ore from Bilbao to Germany during 1942 totalledapproximately 530,000 tons. This was more than double the quantity shippedin 1941 and it is proposed to ship 700,000 tons in 1943. The traffic proceededsteadily from January to June 1942, averaging 52,000 tons per month. July and august made further progress to average 64,000 tons: after which shipmentsfell off, averaging 39,000 tons for the last four months of 1942.The main cause of this sharp reduction in shipments appears to be ourminelaying activities in the neighbourhood of Bayonne. The continued restriction of shipments since the new year must in part be attributed to bad weather conditions, and possibly also to obstructions in the channel or damage to the orequays27. Air reconnaissance of Marseilles on the 26th January showed the departure of two large tankers, the liners Massilia (15,363 tons) Mariette Pacha(12,239 tons) and Andre Lebon (13,862 tons), three ships of the San. Antoniotype (6,000 tons), and another ship of some 7,500 tons. Five smaller ships havealso left, 45 smaller ships remaining in port. A large tanker has arrived at PortVendres from Etang de Berre.
Kursk, and by a rapid thrust to the north of this have-cut the line Orel-Kursk.There is still no indication as to where the Germans may hope to establish a new defence line, but the new Russian thrust has now penetrated west of the linethey held&apos; last winter.Stalingrad Sector.29. As the result of continued Russian attacks, the remnants of theencircled German Sixth Army were split into two groups, one in the north andthe other in the centre of * Stalingrad. The latter group, under the personalcommand of Field-Marshal Paulus, surrendered on the 31st January; the capture of the former group was announced by the Russians on the 2nd February.Donetz-Don Sector.30. North-west of Rostov the Russians, advancing in a westerly directionfrom Starobjelsk, have captured Kupyansk and appear to have driven the Germansback to the line of the Rivers Oskol-Donets.North and east of Rostov there has been no major territorial change, butGerman counter-attacks in the area of the Don-Manieh confluence appear to havedied down.From the south-east the Russians have captured Kushchevskaya and therebycut all rail communication through Rostov to Caucasia.Caucasus Sector.31. The German retirement in northern Caucasia has continued at a rapidpace.   The Russians, in pursuit, have gained ground in three directions :  (a) On the main Baku-Rostov line they have captured Tikhoretsk.(b) Advancing south-westward astride the railway Kropotkm-Krasnodarthey have approached to within 25 miles of the latter town.(c) In the foothills they have retaken Maikop and cleared this large salientof the enemy.Summary.32. The fall of Stalingrad, in anticipation of which the Russians had beenactively restoring the lines running westward and south-westward to Likhayaand Tikhoretsk, should greatly improve Russian communications to the Donbattle front, and so facilitate the resumption of offensive operations againstRostov.Meanwhile, the Germans appear to have decided on a major evacuation ofnorthern Caucasia, carried out partly through Rostov and across the Gulf ofTaganrog, and partly across the Kerch Straits. An attempt, however, may wellbe made to retain a footing on the Taman Peninsula.Libya.33. Since the capture of Tripoli on the 23rd January, the advance of our forces has been slow. In the main only light rear guards have been encountered,but our progress along the main road has been much delayed by demolitions andbad going off the road.Strong patrols pushed forward on the 30th January, but met stiff opposition in the Mars El Margan area about eight miles east of Zuara, and withdrew. Theenemy, however, evacuated Zuara during the night of the 30th/31st, andit was occupied by our troops. Zelten was occupied at 1650 hours on the2nd February, and our patrols reached a point three miles west of the village,having encountered the usual demolitions. Patrols also reached El Assa(15 miles S.W. of Zelten).Our forward patrol line now runs from the area just west of Zelten along the line of the Zuara-Nalut road to Nalut, which had been evacuated by the enemy on the night of the 30th/31st January.Tunisia.34. In the Central Sector the situation remains basically unchanged. Onthe 28th January American forces strengthened their hold on the Ousseltia-Kairouan pass by extending it slightly to the east; in the process they took someprisoners. The northern end of the valley up to the Kairouan-Sidi Said roadwas cleared of the enemy who withdrew slightly to the east in this Sector. On[24992] B 2
the 30th, however, the enemy resumed active patrolling along the north-easternend of the Ousseltia valley and established strong points on the southern slopesof Djebel El Haifa and on the northern slopes of Djebel Ousselat immediately tothe south. Further to the north, on the night 31st January/1st February, theenemy launched an attack against our positions south-east of Sidi Said, andpenetrated initially to a depth of three miles. A counter-attack, however, restoredthe situation. Six enemy tanks, including two of the Mark VI type, were destroyed, but an attempt to recover a Mark VI tank failed owing to its weight.It was photographed and measured.In the Southern Sector, on the 30th, an enemy force, which included60-70 tanks, attacked the positions held by.the French in the Faid gap, where achain of hills crosses the road running west from Sfax. They captured Faid andthen exploited to the south and west. American forces, which had been movedup in support of the French, put in an attack against Faid on the 31st, whichdisclosed that the enemy were holding the eastern and western exits of the passwith infantry, tanks and artillery. The attack, though well supported from theair, was held up principally by the superior range of the enemy artillery, whichcontinued throughout the day. The Americans destroyed 22 Germantanks for the loss of 6 of their own. Further south, on the 31st, an Americanarmoured force, with artillery, advanced east from Gafsa and attacked Sened,which they captured on the 1st February, and their reconnaissance elements arenow working on towards Maknassy, some 20 miles further east, which is believed to be held in some strength. On the 1st contact was made with patrols from asecond American armoured force which was converging on Maknassy from thenorth-west.In the Northern Sector activity has been confined to patrolling, which was most active on the night of the 30th/31st, when our forces raided the enemy positions east of Goubellat, taking 18 prisoners and killing the remainder.French troops occupied the Heidous area on the 31st.Burma.Arakan.35. There is no change on the Rathedaung front. On the Mayu Peninsula,after the arrival of reinforcements, which included tanks, we attacked on the1st February and penetrated enemy positions north of Donbaik (6 miles north ofFoul Point).   Japanese resistance is stubborn and fighting continues.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.36. On the 28th January the Japanese, having been reinforced in theSalamaua area, attacked Australian positions at Wan (30 miles S.W. ofSalamaua). In a successful counter-attack on the 29th, Australian troops killed250, including the regimental commander; sporadic fighting continues in this ai&apos;ea.Solomons.37. U.S. troops have made a further advance on Guadalcanal. Theycrossed the Bonegi River half a mile east of Tassafaronga on the 1st February.Tassafaronga is on the north coast about 15 miles west of Lunga.AIR SITUATION.General Review.38. Bomber Command aircraft made night attacks on Lorient, Cologne and hamburg.Targets in Tunisia and Sicily were heavily bombed.United Kingdom.39. A total of 22 enemy aircraft was reported overland in daylight. on one night, eight raiders, one of which was destroyed by fighters, operated overcoastal areas of N.E. England. During the remainder of the week, a total of seven aircraft, probably engaged in sea-mining, crossed our coast at night forbrief periods.
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.40. On the morning of the 30th three Mosquitos of Bomber Command were despatched to Berlin. These aircraft, after flying at zero feet to Lubeck, dulyappeared over the city at 1100 hours, the time when a speech by Goering wasscheduled to commence; he was an hour late in making his appearance. At1600 hours, three more Mosquitos, one of which is missing, appeared over the city,synchronising, with the commencement of a second speech, this time by Goebbels.In these two operations, 15 x 500-lb. bombs were dropped in the city area.Eight formations of Venturas (B. 34) and one of Bostons (A. 20), in eachcase consisting of 12 aircraft with fighter escort, were despatched against targets in Holland, Belgium and Northern France. Adverse weather interfered with several of these operations but, in good visibility, attacks were made onthe railway viaduct at Morlaix, the engine sheds south of Bruges and, on two occasions, on the railway centre at Abbeville. Photographs taken during the attack at Morlaix show that 36 bombs fell near the east end of the viaduct andtwo of these may have hit it. At Abbeville, bursts were seen in various parts ofthe target, but no hits are claimed on the engine sheds at Bruges. Attacks were also made on the steel works at Ijmuiden and on an aerodrome near St. Omer.From these operations, in which 52 squadrons of fighters were involved as escortand cover, two bombers and six Spitfires are missing. Six enemy fighters were destroyed, seven probably destroyed and seven damaged.In north-west Germany, Wellingtons of which four are missing, attackedEmden, Aurich, Esens, Westerstede and a built-up area near Varel.Harassing operations by aircraft of Fighter and Army Co-operationCommands against communications in the Low Countries and Northern france were on a reduced scale. One locomotive was destroyed and 13 locomotives,several goods trains, eight barges and two coasters were damaged. Two Spitfireswere lost.Night41. Bomber Command despatched 693 aircraft against land targets and attacks were made on Lorient, Cologne, and Hamburg (twice).At Lorient, 73 aircraft attacked and these dropped 144 tons of H.E. andincendiaries. Thick cloud was experienced from mid-Channel to the target area and aircraft bombed on the estimated position assisted by navigational aids. no definite results were observed..In an attack which was completed in 20 minutes, Cologne was bombed by137 heavies, which dropped 460 tons of bombs, including 103 of 4,000-lbs. Severalcrews identified the town visually but the majority bombed on the pathfinders&apos;marker flares, which were somewhat scattered. Many large fires were seen in the target area and these appeared to be spreading well.In both attacks on Hamburg, severe icing conditions en route resulted inmany aircraft returning early. On the first raid, however, reasonable visibilitywas experienced over the target itself and several large fires were started around the ground marker bombs, which were well timed and concentrated. Fires inthe vicinity of the Auben Alster were seen to be taking good. hold. On the secondnight, Hamburg was obscured by thick cloud and most aircraft bombed on thesky marker flares. Beyond a reflected glow on the clouds from fires which appearedto be rather scattered, no results could be seen. In the two raids the 218 aircraft which attacked dropped. 659 tons of H.E. and incendiaries.From the four operations, 30 bombers are missing and five crashed in thiscountry.Coastal Operations.42. Little shipping was sighted but a successful torpedo attack by sixHampdens on a 6,000-ton ship off Norway resulted in six hits and the ship&apos;sdestruction.Beaufighters on patrol in the Bay of Biscay area destroyed, four Ju. 88&apos;s anda further two enemy aircraft were destroyed off Norway and the Frisian Islands.Bomber Command aircraft, of which 39 were despatched, laid 55 sea minesill enemy waters; one aircraft is missing.
sMediterranean.French North A frica.43. Docks and shipping at Bizerta and Ferryville were bombed on four daysby escorted Fortresses (B. 17); over&apos;130 tons of bombs were released. Very large fires were started, hits were seen on four ships, one of which was left sinking,and, in combat, eight enemy fighters were shot down and four more probably damaged; we lost four aircraft. Two successful night attacks were made onBizerta by a total of 25 Wellingtons; in the first attack 25 tons of bombs were dropped.Hits on the quays, railway yards and barracks were made when 70 U.S.bombers, escorted by fighters, attacked Sfax. One Allied aircraft did not return;six enemy aircraft were shot down. Later in the week, the airfield at Sfax wasthe target for 30 U.S. bombers, which destroyed a number of aircraft on theground.Tunis and its airfield at El Aouina were raided on three occasions by escortedU.S. bombers. Bursts among 50 parked aircraft were seen, a ship in harbour was set on fire and hits were made on railway installations. In attacks on Gabes,bombs were dropped among about 35 aircraft on the airfield, many of which, withsix large transport aircraft, were set on fire. During the operations againstEl Aouina and Gabes, Allied aircraft inflicted severe casualties on interceptingfighters, 29 of which were destroyed, 14 more probably destroyed and ninedamaged; nine Allied aircraft were shot down.In addition to providing cover for our ground forces, numerousreconnaissances and attacks on transport and troop concentrations were carriedout, particularly in the areas of Faid. Mateur, Pont du Fahs and Djedeida; anumber of lorries and some tanks were-put out of action. A railway bridge nearMaknassy was damaged.Activity by Axis aircraft included operations in the Bone and Algiers areas and against our airfields. Fighter-bombers, six of which were destroyed,approached Bone on several occasions. Five attacks developed, but, onlyin two instances, when two Spitfires and two Sword fish were destroyed on the airfield, was any damage reported. Two dive-bombing attacks on Souk: el Khemisairfield resulted in the destruction on the ground of four of our fighters and damage to 12 others. A force of 24 Ju. 87s, escorted by Me. 109s, made an unsuccessful attempt to attack our troops in the Maknassy area; 12 war hawks(P. 40E), of which three are missing, shot down three Ju. 87s, probably destroyed two and damaged five. Four Spitfires were shot down in an engagement with anumber of F.W. 109s, which were attacking our ground forces near Fairouan.Tripolitania.44. Operations over the forward area, which were restricted by bad weather,consisted mainly of armed reconnaissances, the bombing of troops and stores atPisida and at other places between Zuara and the Tunisian frontier. Anti-shipping strikes were carried out against small supply vessels off the coast, several of which were sunk and others damaged.An attack by seven enemy aircraft on Tripoli harbour caused no damage.Sicily, Sardinia and the Sicilian Channel.45. A considerable weight of bombs was dropped at Messina during threedaylight attacks by Liberators (B. 24) and two night attacks by Flalifaxes. the train ferry terminus was hit several times, and other objectives set on fire probablyincluded oil storage cisterns. &quot; A vast amount of damage &quot; was admitted in theofficial Italian communique. Three hits were made on a ship in harbour and otherbombs fell among ships anchored in the roads. Later, a 9,000-ton ship was hit by liberators (B.24).Successful bombing raids were carried out on a number of other points in sicily, including Trapani, Catania, Palermo, Augusta, Pozzallo and power stations at Avola (15 miles S.W. of Syracuse) and Modica (5 miles S. of Ragusa).The airfields on Lampedusa Island and at Elmas, Sardinia, were also bombed.Torpedo-carrying Wellingtons from Malta made hits on a 2,500-ton ship off Cape Rizzuto. on a destroyer, which was last seen stationary and listing offPantellaria, and on a 3,500-ton tanker, subsequently beached off Cape Colonne.Marauders (B.2B) hit two ships in convoy north of Bizerta.
Russia.46. The Russians claim that, during the week ended the 31st January, theydestroyed 141 German aircraft for the loss of 73 of their own. torpedo bombers sank four ships in the far North, estimated to total 27,000 tons. Thegreatest effort was between Voronezh and the Caucasus, particularly the latter,where, on the 27th January, 400 Russian aircraft made continuous attacks onforward troops and supply roads and where it is probable they had completeair superiority. On the 31st January, Rostov was raided for seven hours; dockbuildings and ships were damaged. On the 3rd February, attacks were madeon German-occupied towns in the Crimea and Black Sea area, particularlyKerch, Taman and Anapa. Torpedo aircraft sank a 3,000-ton ship in the black Sea.Though operations by the German Air Force, as a whole, continued to be ona low scale, it is likely that fairly heavy attacks were, at times, launched againstthe Russian advance west of Voronezh and in the area of the Lower Don. Onthe Donetz front, the Germans, on the 30th January, were asking urgently forair support and fighter protection. Occasional activity was reported from the leningrad sector.India and Burma.47. The Allied effort has been mainly directed against targets in theRathedaung/Akyab area and shipping off the Arakan coast. About 120 bombers and 100 fighters were involved in these operations, but no important results are reported. United States Liberators (B. 24) bombed Rangoon and started somefires in the warehouses.The only enemy activity consisted of a small attack on the jetties atMaungdaw.Pacific Zone.New Guinea Area.48. Allied medium bombers and fighters continued to attack enemy positionsalong the Mubo/Komiatum track, but operations by U.S. heavy bombers wererestricted to attacks, mostly by single aircraft, on the airfields and villages atFinschafen and Wewak, and on stores at Kaukenau (370 miles N.W. of Merauke).Hudsons (A. 29) attacked the harbour area of Toeal (Kai Islands), where large fires were started.New Britain.49. U.S. heavy bombers made two attacks on Rabaul harbour, where anunidentified ship was hit, and also bombed the adjacent airfields at Vunakanau,Lakunai and Kokpop. Gasmata airfield was attacked on four occasions by single aircraft, and it is probable that a merchant ship of 2,500 tons lying in Open Baywas damaged by bombs from a U.S. Liberator (B. 24).Timor.50. Six Beaufighters effectively attacked Koepang airfield, where about eightaircraft on the ground and two large buildings were either destroyed or damaged.Solomon Islands.51. On the 27th, escorted U.S. bombers attacked Kolombansrara Island inthe New Georgia group and in the evening U.S. dive-bombers and torpedo-bombers attacked an enemy destroyer and cargo ship in Vella Gulf; the cargo ship was left sinking and the destroyer was damaged by near misses. On thefollowing day enemy ships off Kolombangara Island were attacked; a cargo ship and a tanker were damaged and, a torpedo hit caused a large explosion on a,destroyer.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.52. On four days bombs were dropped in the South and on one night in north-East England. Except for a few casualties and some damage to houses and public utility installations at Bexhill (28th), Margate (30th), Battle (2nd),Ashford and Swanage (3rd), and Sunderland (3rd/4th), incidents were mostlytrivial. Transport services at Swanage and at Sunderland were interruiDtedby U.X.B.Casualties.53. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours onthe 3rd February were seven killed and 13 seriously injured.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. in combining the figures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form. The figures for non-tankers relateto the last day of the month while those for tankers relate to the 15th of the month to February 1942 and to the last day of the month from March 1942.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in December 1942 these comprised 27 tankers of 225,000 gross tons.(b) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A part of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3) ).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eire
