GANDHI IN THE EVENT OF HISUNDERTAKING A FAST.By direction of the Prime Minister the attached telegrams, which havealready been circulated separately, have been printed for the War Cabinet andare circulated for convenience.L. S. A.India Office, February 11, 1943.(1) -Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India,dated 22nd December, 1942.3566-S. Personal. Your personal telegram of 8th September No. (115753),and connected correspondence. Fast by Gandhi. I have since had Lumley&apos;sletter of 22nd October (copy by bag of 27th October) and his further letter of 4th November (copy by bag of 24th November). I have considered these letters,which contain very careful analysis of position, with Maxwell, and in the lightof his views and those of Home Department I fear that with (? regret) I must accept Lumley&apos;s objections to suggested procedure as fatal (sic). We do notthink it would be justifiable to force Lumley to take the very grave risks whichhe anticipates as likely to result from that policy, and it is tolerably clear fromhis letter that there would be almost insuperable difficulties in working it in (? the)manner proposed or in securing advantages for which I had hoped from it.2. If that view is accepted, we are, I fear though with very great reluctance,driven back to contemplating Gandhi&apos;s release before his fast becomes fatal.Situation is to some extent altered by the Surgeon-General&apos;s opinion mentioned inparagraph No. 8 (e) of Lumley&apos;s letter of 22nd October, that Gandhi wouldprobably not recover from a fast lasting more than three or four days. That tosome extent reduces difficulties of situation, since there would be less time to whipup popular excitement before the critical stage is reached, and it is arguable thatin those circumstances no really useful object would be served by concealing fastfrom public, as I suggested to Lumley in my telegram of 31st October (copy bybag of 24th November) unless, of course, circumstances were such as to make thiscourse essential. In his present state of health it is always possible that on sucha plan we might be caught out by a sudden collapse, when we should be blamedfor not having let the public know.3. It will, I think, be necessary to retain Gandhi at the Aga Khan&apos;sPalace when fast starts rather than attempt to transfer him to Wardha or anyother place, since his possible death on the journey would be, to say the least of it,embarrassing. Procedure, as we conceive it, would be to remove guards fromthe Palace and inform Gandhi that he was a free man.4. I am myself rather inclined to agree with Lumley&apos;s view that Gandhi isnot at present intending a fast. Its attractiveness will be considerably lost if he knows, as he probably does, that he could not last for more than a few clays,[25025]  - B
and I am told, on good authority, that he got a real fright on the occasion of his last fast, when he was released only after he had himself given up hope. It isimpossible to be certain what he may do, particularly if anything happenedspecially to upset him. But there seems at least some ground for hoping that thesituation may not arise. If it does, in the light of my correspondence withLumley, (? we are) now driven to releasing him from custody when medical advicetells us that danger point is approaching. If he subsequently stops fast and(1 recovers) both doubtful hypotheses his re-arrest would have to lieconsidered, and with possibility of further fasts. But we need not take thatfence now.5. My own feelings in this matter, as you know, have been consistentlyin favour of taking a stiff line with Gandhi. But we have to consider repercussions-sions both here and outside, and. in the light of Lumley&apos;s views I hope thaiCabinet will feel able to reconsider. I am assured.that Gandhi&apos;s release when in danger of his life has never been publicly regarded as a victory over Governmentin the past, and my advisers see no reason to believe that it would be so on present occasion (sic). The moment for his (? release) would depend on circumstances-stances and. perhaps, on grounds for his fast; but in any case I should proposeto announce the release in a suitable communique, drawing attention, amongst other things, to Gandhi&apos;s own condemnation of hunger striking, and hinting atthe undue advantage he was taking of fact that he had always been treated by government with special personal consideration. I should also propose to briny,&apos;out the point that he had been detained in order to prevent him from leadingthe mass movement, and that need for such detention no longer existed when hewas physically incapable of doing so. Indeed, detention after reaching that stage would be punitive rather than preventive in character.(2)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 3rd January, 1943.22-S.C. Personal. I have had the following letter, marked personal, dated30th December from Gandhi. Begins: Dear Lord Linlithgow, This is a very-personal letter. Contrary, to Biblical injunction, I have allowed many suns toset on a quarrel I have harboured against you, but I must not allow the old yearto expire without disburdening myself of what is rankling in my breast againstyou. I had thought we were friends. I still love to think so. However, whatlias happened since 9th August last makes me wonder whether you still regardme as a friend. I have perhaps not come in such close touch with any otheroccupant of your Gacli as with you.Your arrest of me, the communique you issued thereafter, your reply toRajaji and the reasons you have given therefor, Mr. Amery&apos;s attack on me and much else I can catalogue, go to show that at some stage or other you musthave suspected my bona fides; mention of other Congressmen in the sameconnexion is by the way. Concern seems to be the fons et origo of all the evilimputed to Congress. If I have not ceased to be your friend why did you not,before taking drastic action, send for me, tell me of your suspicions and makeyourself sure of your facts 1 I am quite capable of seeing myself as others seems, but in this case I have failed hopelessly. I find that all statements made about me in Government quarters in this connexion contain palpable departures from truth, I have so much fallen from grace that I could not establish contact with a dying friend; I mean Professor Bhansari, who is fasting in regard toChimur affair, and I am expected to condemn the so-called violence of some people reputed to be Congressmen, although I have no data for such condemn a-tion save the heavily censored reports of newspapers.I must own that I thoroughly distrust these reports. I could write muchmore but I must not lengthen my tale of woe. I am sure that what I have saidis enough to enable you to fill in details.You know I returned to India from South Africa at the end of 1914 witha mission which came to me in 1906, namely, to speak truth and non-violenceamong mankind in face of violence and falsehood in all walks of life. The law of Satyagraiha knows no defeat. Prison is one of many ways of spreading the message, but it has its limits. You have placed me in a palace where everyreasonable creature comfort is ensured. I have freely partaken of latter purelyas a matter of duty, never as a pleasure, in the hope that some day those that have time will realise that they have wronged innocent men. I have givenmyself six months.   The period is drawing to a close, so is my patience.   The
law of Satyagraha, as I know it, prescribes a remedy in such distresses of trial,hi a sentence it is &quot; crucify the flesh by fasting.&quot; That same law forbids its use except as a last resort. I do not want to use it if I can avoid it. This isthe way to avoid it, convince me of my error or errors and I shall make ampleamends. Send for me or send someone who knows your mind and can carryconviction. There are worthy other ways if you have the will. May I expectan early reply ? May the new year bring peace to us all. I am your sincerefriend, M. K. Gandhi.   Ends.   My comments follow.(3)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 6th January, 1943.37-S. Private and personal. My private and personal telegrams,4th January, 14-S and 3rd January. 22-SC. Gandhi&apos;s letter. I propose to sendhim reply contained in my immediately succeeding telegram. That reply, as you will see, deliberately misses his main point, and is designed to make him showhis hand a little further. It also leaves him to draw his own conclusions, though he can have no difficulty in drawing them. I am clear, after much experience of gandhi, that this is wisest course to take, and Maxwell (who is only person I havetaken into my confidence) agrees.2. There can be no question of allowing Congress to take the line that they find they have made a mistake and want to be taken back into grace again.Essential pre-conditions of any arrangement would be formal and public with-drawal of resolution of last August from which their incarceration flowed, noindemnities, no enquiries (though we should, I think, be wise not to suggest by raising that point that we have anything to conceal), and some understanding(wording of which would not be easy to draft) as to future. That, however, canwait until we get Gandhi&apos;s come-back, and 1 will, of course, consult you as to terms of my reply. In addition it would, in my judgment, be well when I sendthat reply to make it clear to him that we do not intend that, if he does fast, he shall die in our hands : that he will die as a free man : and (though here againI shall have to consider my words carefully) between us have no intention of allowing Congress or anyone else to pursue illegal ends without interference, butintend so to handle any arrangement (if we get to the stage of considering one)as to leave Gandhi no room for complaint if he subsequently departs from itand has to be rearrested. Important thing is to avoid parleying with him orgiving him an excuse for that hair-splitting correspondence at which he is soexpert. But I do not think that my present draft gives him much room to move,and. I have it in mind to be more specific (subject to his reply) in the next one.3. I have carefully considered whether it would be better to face the issuenow, in the hope that if he understands that we do not propose to be blackmailedit may deter him from fasting. But I see much advantage in playing for time,and am strongly averse from presenting him with an obvious target in the firstround.4. I am keeping this correspondence entirely secret save from Maxwell.I am not mentioning it to my Council at this stage and feel no obligation to do so,since, apart from its purely personal character, I am not conveying a finaldecision to him. When the time comes I will let my Council know that I had fromGandhi an entirely personal approach which he described as very personal andwhich I did not feel at liberty to communicate to them : that, not being certainwhat he really wanted, I had replied to him on the same personal basis : and that from his reply the position emerges that, &amp;c, &amp;c. If my Council get to knowat this stage of this correspondence its existence is bound to leak out and we shallget a campaign working up to prevent Gandhi fasting, which is the very lastthing we want. I should judge that there was quite a chance that the old manmight think better of his threat to resort to these tactics if he found that we were quite prepared to see it through.5. It is important that I should reply without delay, and I shall thereforedespatch my letter as drafted on 9th morning unless by then I hear from vouthat you have any amendments to suggest.38-S.   Following is draft (marked personal) referred to in my immediatelypveceding telegram : Begins: Thank you for your personal letter of 31st December, which I have just received.   I fully accept its personal character, and I welcome its frankness.[25025&quot;1 B 2
And my reply will be, as you would wish it to be, as frank and as entirely personalas your letter itself.2. I was glad to have your letter, for, to be as open with you as our closerelation justifies, I have been profoundly depressed during recent months, first,by policy that was adopted by Congress in August; secondly, because, while that policy gave rise, as I knew it must, throughout the country to violence and crime(I say nothing of risks to India from outside aggression), no word of condemn a-tion for that violence and crime should have come from you, or from the working committee. When you were first at Poona I knew that you were not receivingnewspapers, and I accepted that as explaining your silence. When arrangements were made that you and the Working Committee should have such newspapersas you desired, I felt certain that details those newspapers contained of whatwas happening would shock and distress you as much as it has us all, and thatyou would be anxious to make your condemnation of it categorical and widely known. But that was not the case; and it has been a real disappointment to me,all the more when I think of these murders, the burning alive of police officials,the wrecking of trains, the destruction of property, the misleading of these youngstudents, which has done so much harm to India&apos;s good name and to the congress party. You may take it from me&apos; that the newspaper accounts you mention are1&apos;well-founded I only wish they were not, for the story is a bad one. I well know the immense weight of your great authority in Congress movement and withsympathisers with that movement, and I wish I could feel, again speakingvery frankly, that a heavy &quot;responsibility did not rest on you, little as I like tothink it. (And, unhappily, while initial responsibility rests with the leaders,others have to bear the consequences, whether as law-breakers, with results thatthat involves, or as victims.)3. But if I am right in reading your letter to mean that, in the light of what has happened, you wish now to retrace your steps and dissociate yourself frompolicy of last summer, you have only to let me know and I will at once considerthe matter further. And, if I have failed to understand your object, you mustnot hesitate to let me know without delay in what respect I have done so. and tellme what positive suggestion you wish to put to me. You know me well enoughafter these many years, in which our contacts have been so close and friendly, tobelieve that I shall be only too concerned to meet with same close attention as everany message which I receive from you, to give it the fullest weight, and to approach it with deepest anxiety to understand your feeling and your motives.Ends.(4)Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, dated 8th January, 1943.27. Private and personal. Secret. War Cabinet considered last nightboth your revised proposals for dealing with Gandhi if he should fast (yourpersonal telegram 3566-S and Lumley&apos;s letters were before them) and yourproposed reply to Gandhi&apos;s letter.They wished me to remind you that from the outset it was understood thatif Gandhi were detained he should not be allowed to secure release by threat ofa fast unto death. They attach great importance to preserving principle involved and if conditions are now such that he could be released without serious riskthey would prefer that he should be set at liberty on compassionate grounds, forexample, his age, health, and fact that he has already been detained for nearlysix months and that the crisis has lessened,&apos; rather than that he should be ableby fasting to obtain his release at any time. They would be glad to have your views on this suggestion before any further action is taken and in the meantimedesire that no reply be sent to Gandhi&apos;s letter to you.
SKK?    (5)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 11th January, 1943.81-S. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram8th January, No. 27. Gandhi. I am grateful to Cabinet for consideration theyhave given to this difficult business. I realise the importance they attach to it.But my considered view after careful weighing of their points is that we should go ahead on the lines and in terms that I originally recommended. &quot;While I appreciate considerations weighing with Cabinet they will not overlook that Ihave very close familiarity with Gandhi and his tactics; that immediateresponsibility for handling of the situation falls on me; and that equally general position is one which I have handled for a good many years. Before putting forward my earlier recommendations, to which I adhere, I had given the fullestweight to points taken in Cabinet discussion. I remain clear that the draft inthe light of their views and the course I have already recommended is theright one.2.   On specific points (a) I fully realise attitude of Cabinet towards letting Gandhi fast to death.As you know, I have myself had every sympathy with that course which I consistently pressed at earlier stages. It was only in thelight of Lumley&apos;s views which have been before the Cabinet and whichcarried conviction to me that, however reluctantly, I have had toadvise a different course. Those views have the general support of the governors and the full support of my Home Member who has greatexperience. I have again discussed situation with Lumley. Hereaffirms his earlier view, to which I must attach great weight since he is my most experienced Governor and responsible for the Provincein which Gandhi is, that local reaction to letting Gandhi die&apos; as a prisoner would be far more dangerous and far-reaching than to hisdying as a free man of his own choice, restraint having been removed.Point assumes additional importance in view of grievous food shortage in Bombay and increased tenseness of atmosphere there.(&amp;) To consider releasing Gandhi on the basis suggested in your telegram 27,now that he has hinted at a fast, would in my judgment be impossible.It would be a great tactical success for Gandhi and for us ahumiliating surrender. It would leave us in a much weaker position for rearresting him if he started to give trouble again, and we shouldbe no further forward if he subsequently resorted to this weapon.And he is quite unpredictable : whether released or not he is quitecapable of fasting on any excuse that he thinks will be tacticallysound. On the other hand, I see no difficulty about keeping him in prison until a fast endangers his health (though that would probablybe only two or three days at the most after a fast began) and thensetting him free on health grounds. I can arrange to make sure that he is not released until there is a real danger. If he is releasedwhen in immediate danger of health and thereafter recovers and startsto make himself a nuisance again, I shall have no hesitation in puttinghim back in jail the moment he infringes the lawT.(c) Bhansari case is not in point: Bhansari is not a prisoner or under detention. He is indulging in a private fast in his own house whichwe cannot stop unless we buy him off by promise of an enquiry. Ihave no intention of agreeing to that. If he wants to die I amperfectly prepared to let him die. No analogy can be drawn between his case and Gandhi&apos;s.. As for Working Committee, I see little riskof their resorting to a fast: that is not their technique.3. Attitude of my Council is also relevant. As already explained, I amtreating my present correspondence with Gandhi as wholly personal and have notcommunicated it to them. No hint of it has therefore got out. If I definitelyput to them now the issue of letting Gandhi fast and die at this stage news is bound to get out and a press agitation to develop thenceforward. I wouldcertainly not anticipate united support and might very well have a majorityagainst me. Resignation of Hindus on such an issue would have most fortunate effect and I doubt certain of them being willing to shelter behind
fact that responsibility was mine. They will probably be most, difficult to handleand I shall be in a much better position to deal with them if I follow course have already indicated.4. As regards terms of my letter, it is based on close acquaintance withworking of Gandhi&apos;s mind and I attach great importance to its issuing as it stands, without strengthening or modification. Its object is to get him to showhis hand, in which I hope, though I may be disappointed, that it will succeed.Reliable report received since I telegraphed to you is to the effect that heoriginally decided on a 21 days&apos; fast from 18th January to 8th February butsubsequently decided to send me a friendly letter. My letter gives him no change,but puts it on him to come back if he has further justification. Its second paragraph brings out quite sufficiently clearly to Gandhi, who has had news-papers, my judgment of Congress responsibility (his sensitiveness and that of Bisentourage on this point is well illustrated by the fact that I have yesterdayreceived a letter from Miss Slade, his companion in jail, protesting vigorouslyagainst suggestion in Indian and European and American Press that gandhi and/or Working Committee are pro-Japanese, and sending documents designedto show that they are not).5. If the Cabinet are in doubt over any point I hope that they will let meknow, but I repeat in the strongest terms possible that my advice to them isthat I should reply to Gandhi in terms of letter I have communicated to yon,and with minimum of delay, and that we should consider the matter again when we receive reply.(6)Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy, dated 12th January, 1943.44. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram 81-S of11th January. Gandhi. War Cabinet have considered matter again in light ofyour further views. They requested me to inform you that their views had not changed but that, as the immediate responsibility for handling the situation isyours, they do not wish to interfere with your considered judgment that thematter would best be dealt with on the lines you have proposed both as regardsthe terms of the reply to be sent to Gandhi and the action to be taken if Gandhiundertakes a fast.(?)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 13th January, 1943.102-S. Private and personal. Your private and personal telegram of12th January, No. 44.   Gandhi.   I am most grateful to War Cabinet.(8)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 2Qth January, 1943.199-S. Personal. Following is Gandhi&apos;s letter dated 19th January.Begins: I received your kind letter of the 13th instant yesterday at 2-30 p.m. Ihad almost despaired of ever hearing from you.   Please excuse my impatience.Your letter gladdens me to find that I have not lost caste with you.My letter of 31st December was a growl to prepare you. Yours is a counter-growl. It means that you maintain that you were right in arresting me and you were sorry for commissions of which, in your opinion, I was guilty.The inference you draw from my letter is, I am afraid, not correct. I havere-read my letter in the light of your interpretation, but have failed to find yourmeaning in it. I wanted to fast and should still want to if nothing comes out ofour correspondence and I have to be a helpless witness to what is going on in thecountry, including the privations of millions owing to the universal scarcitystalking the land.
If I do not accept your interpretation of my letter, you want me to make a positive suggestion. This I might be able to do only if you put me amongstmembers of the Working Committee of Congress.If I could be convinced of my error or worse, of which you are, evidently, Ishould need to consult nobody, so far as my own action is concerned, to make a fulland open confession and make ample amends. But I have not any conviction of error. I wonder if you saw my letter to the Secretary to the Government of india of 21sf. September, 1942. I adhere to what I have said in it and in my letter toyou of 14th August, 1942.Of course, I deplore the happenings which have taken place since 9th Augustlast. But have I not laid the whole blame for them at the door of the Governmentof India ? Moreover, I could not express any opinion on events which I cannotinfluence or control and of which I have but a one-sided account. You are boundprima facie to accept the accuracy of reports that may be placed before you by your departmental heads. But you will not expect me to do so. Such reports have, before now, often proved fallible. It was for that reason that, in my letterof 31st December, I pleaded with you to convince me of correctness of information on which your conviction was based. You will, perhaps, appreciate my funda-mental difficulty in making statement you have expected me to make.This, however, I can say from the housetop, that I am as confirmed a believerin non-violence as I have ever been. You may not know that any violence on thepart of Congress workers I have condemned openly and unequivocally. I haveeven done public penance more than once. I must not weary you with (omission)s.The point I wish to make is that, on every such occasion, I was a free man.This time the (? retracting), as I have submitted, lies with Government. Youwill forgive &quot;me for expressing an opinion challenging yours. I am certain that nothing but good would have resulted if you had stayed your hand and granted me the interview, which I had announced, on the night of 8th August, I was to seek.But that was not to be.Here may I remind you that Government of India have before now ownedtheir mistake, as for instance, in the Punjab when late General Dyer was con-demned, in the United Provinces when a corner of a mosque in Cawnpore was(omissioned)ed, and in Bengal, when partition was annulled. All these things were done in spite of great and previous mob violence. To sum up : (1) if you wantme to act singly, convince me that I was wrong, and I will make ample amends;(2) if you want me to make any proposal on behalf of Congress you should put meamong Congress Working Committee members. I do plead with you to make upyour mind to end the impasse.If I am obscure or have not answered your letter fully, please point outomissions and I shall make an attempt to give you satisfaction.I have no mental reservation.I find that my letters to you are sent through the Government of Bombay.This procedure must involve some loss of time. As time is of essence in this matter,perhaps you will issue instructions that my letters to you may be sent directly bythe Superintendent of this camp.   Ends.(9)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 2Qth January, 1943.200-S. Private and personal. Following is my reply to Gandhi :Begins: Many thanks for your personal letter of 19th January, which I have just received,&quot;and which I need not say I have read with close care and attention.But I am still, I fear, rather in the dark. I made clear to you in my last letterthat, however reluctantly, the course of events, and my familiarity with what hasbeen taking place, has left me no choice but to regard the Congress movement,and you as its authorised and fully instructed spokesman at the time of thedecision of last August, as responsible for the sad campaign of violence andcrime, and revolutionary activity which has done so much harm, and so muchinjury to India&apos;s credit, since last August. I note what you say aboutnon-violence. I am very glad to read your unequivocal condemnation of violence,and I am well aware of the importance which you have given to that article ofyour creed in the past. But the events of these last months, and even the eventsthat are happening to-day, show that it has not met with full support of certainat any rate of your followers, and the mere fact that they may have fallen short
of an ideal which you have advocated is no answer to relations of those who have lost their lives, and to those themselves who have lost their property or sufferedsevere injury as a result of violent activities on the part of Congress and itssupporters. And I cannot, I fear, accept as an answer your suggestion that &quot; thewhole blame &quot; has been laid by you yourself at the door of the Government ofIndia. We are dealing with facts in this matter, and they have to be faced. and while, as I made clear in my last letter, I am very anxious to have from youanything that you may have to say or any specific proposition that you mayhave to make, the position remains that it is not the Government of India, butCongress and yourself that are on their justification in this matter.2. If therefore you are anxious to inform me that you repudiate ordissociate yourself from resolution of 9th August and policy which that resolutionrepresents, and if you can give me appropriate assurances as regards the future,I shall, I need not say. be very ready to consider the matter further. But it isof course very necessary to be clear on that point, and you will not, I know, take it amiss that I should make that clear in plainest possible words.3.   I will ask the Governor of Bombay to arrange that any communication&apos;from you should be sent through him, which will, I trust, reduce delay in its-transmission.   Ends.(10)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 1st February, 1943.32-S.C. Personal. I am telegraphing separately text of Gandhi&apos;s reply.As you will see, he holds to his ground, which is, briefly, that responsibility forCongress rebellion rests not on him or on Congress but on us, because of mydecision not to wait until he asked to see me last August, and indignation of his followers at repressive action taken by the Government of India consequent onResolution of 9th August. He repeats his offer to be convinced of his error (withits corollary that it is up to us to justify ourselves to him), but repeats equallyhis refusal to condemn anything for which he is not first satisfied that full responsibility rests with him or with Congress.2. In his letter of 19th January he introduced for first time the food situation. His present letter adds to food situation the National Governmentissue (touched on also in his letters to me of 14th August and to the home department of 23rd September last), and his readiness to see a Governmentformed by Jinnah. Both of these are solid. ,red herrings designed in the eventof publication to deflect public attention from weakness of Congress case in face of public opinion, and it will be essential to keep him to the point.3. As regards his threatened fast, you will observe that it is now not to be afast to death if that can be avoided, and that he proposes to take water and fruitjuices. It is quite conceivable. I suppose, that he might hold out even for twenty-one days on that diet. Difficult question which I shall have to discuss with my council is that of publicity : for the moment that it becomes known that he isembarking on any sort of fast, however unsubstantial the reason to, we shall ofcourse have press campaign which, as I mentioned in my telegram of 6th January,37-S; I always anticipated. But I shall have to see how feeling in Council goes,and shape my course accordingly. I will telegraph again after meeting onWednesday. My own clear view is that : (a) Gandhi must remain in jail until he isin imminent danger of death, and cannot be released under a threat, (b) If I could get my colleagues to stand for no publicity, at any rate at this stage, there would bea great deal to be said for that. If publicity has to be given to fact of a fast, then we should be prepared to use censorship to control press references to it. (c) Itwill still be desirable to warn Gandhi in terms, even though he now says thathe does not contemplate a fast to death but a &quot; fast to capacity,&quot; that if hisfast brings him within immediate danger of death, he will not be allowed to dieas a prisoner. While, if I could but get my colleagues to agree, there would beeverything to be said for telling him also that no publicity or minimum publicitywould be given to his fast. But I doubt my being able to carry that point, andif my doubts are well based we shall have to face a great deal of public excitementand even possibly interruption of war effort during the 3 weeks following the9th February.
[25025]cTelegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 1st February, 1943.33-S.C. Personal. I have had following reply from Gandhi to my letterof 29th January. Begins: I must thank you warmly for your prompt reply tomy letter of 19th instant. I wish I could agree with you that your letter is clear,lam sure you do not wish to imply by (? clearness) simply that you hold aparticular, opinion strongly. I have pleaded and would continue to plead, till the last breath, that you should at least make an attempt to convince me ofvalidity of opinion you hold that August resolution of Congress is responsiblefor popular violence&quot; that broke out on 9th August last and after, even thoughit broke out after wholesale arrest of principal Congress workers. Was not the drastic and unwarranted action of Government responsible for reported violence?You have not even said what part of August resolution is bad, or offensive in your opinion. That resolution is in no way a retraction by Congress of its policy of non-violence. It is definitely against Fascism in every shape or form,it tenders co-operation in war effort under circumstances which alone can make effective and nation-wide co-operation possible. Is all this open to reproach?Objection may be raised to that clause of resolution which contemplated civildisobedience. Manifesto by itself cannot constitute an objection since principleof civil disobedience is implicitly conceded in what is known as Gandhi-Irwinpact. Even that civil disobedience was not to be started before knowing resultof meeting for which I was to seek from you an appointment.Then take the unproved and in my opinion improvable charges hurled againstCongress and me by so responsible a Minister as the Secretary of State for India.Surely I can say with suavity that it is for the Government to justify their action by solid evidence, not by mere ipse dixit.But you throw (? in my) face the fact of murders by persons reputed to beCongress men. I see the fact of murders as clearly I hope as you do. My answer is that the Government goaded people to the point of madness. They startedleonine violence in the shape, of arrests already referred to. That violence isnot any less so (? because) it was organised on a scale so gigantic that it displacesthe Mosaic law of a tooth for a tooth by that of 10,000 for 1 not to mention the corollary of the Mosaic law, i.e., of non-resistance as enunciated by Jesus Christ.I cannot interpret in any other manner the repressive measures of the all-powerful Government of India.Add to this tale of woe the privations of the poor millions due to India-widescarcity, which I cannot help thinking might have been largely mitigated, ifnot altogether prevented, had there been a bona fide National Governmentresponsible to a popularly elected Assembly.If, then, I cannot get soothing balm for my pain, I must resort to lawprescribed for Satyagrahis, namely a fast according to capacity. I mustcommence after the early morning breakfast of 9th February a fast for 21 daysending on the morning of 2nd March. Usually during my fasts I take waterwith addition of salts. But nowadays my system refuses water. This time,therefore, I propose to add juices of citrus fruit to make water drinkable, for my wish is not to fast unto death, but to survive the ordeal of the feat if God sowills.  This fast can be ended sooner by Government giving the needed relief.I am not marking this letter personal as I did the two previous ones. Theywere in no way confidential.  They were a mere personal appeal.Post script. The following was inadvertently omitted : The Governmenthave evidently ignored or overlooked the very material fact that Congress by its August resolution asked nothing for itself. All its demands were for thewhole people. As you should be aware, the Congress was willing and preparedfor Government inviting Qaid-e-Azam Jinnah to form a (? national) Governmentsubject to general adjustments as may be necessary for duration of the war, suchGovernment being responsible to a duly elected assembly. Being isolated&apos;fromWorking Gommittee except Srimati Naidu, I do not know its present view. Butcommittee is not likely to have changed its mind.   Ends.2. I shall be in Delhi on Wednesday morning and will take matter inCouncil that day, and will thereafter telegraph to you.
(12)Telegram from Viceroy (o Secretary of State for India, dated 2nd February, 104:;.40-rS.C. Private and personal. Following is extract from a circular toall Governors, paragraphs 3 to 5.   Begins:3. So far I have kept our correspondence strictly personal, and it liasnot been mentioned to my Council or to anyone except the Secretary of State.Point has now been reached at which 1 shall be formally consulting my Council(probably to-morrow). Gandhi *s main proposition is, of course, entirelyunacceptable, but it leaves the impression that he is fighting a rearguard action.For all that, we may have a good deal of trouble before we get over the next stage.4. Question of degree of publicity to be given to his fast will have to beconsidered. That will largely be a matter for my Council and I do not proposeto trouble you about it. I should, however, be grateful for your view as toreactions you would anticipate (and your own feeling) as between the followingalternatives :  (a) Gandhi to be retained in confinement until his death.(b) Gandhi &quot;to be released when in immediate danger of death.(c) Application to Gandhi of cat and mouse procedure.5. It goes without saying, of course, that all medical and other comfortsand assistance will be made available to him, and we should take no responsibilityfor his decision to fast which is entirely a matter for him. One has to consider,on the one hand, possible reactions on the Services, loyalists, &amp;c, of Gandhibeing released even when in imminent danger of death without any undertakingfor the future; on the other hand, full weight has to be given to violence of popular emotion (which will bear no relation whatever to strength or weakness of his case and would be (? affronted) merely by fear of Gandhi&apos;s death); possiblemisrepresentation in left wing press at home and in United States; and finally(a point of substantial importance) reactions inside my own Council.Fact that fast is not in terms of a fast unto death but &quot; to capacity &quot; andfor a period of twenty-one days only during which Gandhi will take water andfruit juice is, of course, relevant.   Ends.(13)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 3rd February, 1943.277-S. Personal. My personal telegram of 2nd February, 40-S.C. Repliesso far received from the Governors are as follows : Madras and Punjab favourcourse (b). Clow favours (c). Hallett, Twynam and Dow favour course (a).Lumley (whose telegram I repeat separately) remains strongly of opinion thatthe right course is in effect (b) or (? conceivably) (e).2. I will discuss in Council this afternoon. My own personal leaning isstill to (a), but, after exhaustive discussions to-day with Maxwell in the lightof Governors views reported above, I feel little doubt answer may be as previouslyagreed that Gandhi should be released if and when in immediate danger of death. I propose, however, to put the matter to Council on the basis of keepinghim in confinement until he dies, and only to go down to release in the event of immediate danger to his life if that is their definite view.3. Information from Lumley is to the effect that Surgeon-General Candy,an experienced officer, doubts if he can carry on for more than three or four days,while Mrs. Naidu appears to have informed the detention authorities that, whileGandhi was very confident of his strength, she thinks herself that he has muchover-estimated his powers of resistance at his present age. But I shall make itclear that if decision is in favour of release in the event of immediate danger tohis life, that those instructions must be interpreted very strictly indeed and thatthere must be no question of any release before the clanger is very real and quiteimmediate.4. As regards publicity, what I have in mind is a public announcement onceGandhi begins his fast (pending which I would ask my colleagues and endeavourin all other respects to keep the possibility entirely secret) that will be accom-paniecl by pre-censorship instructions as to messages about his condition. &amp;c,which would be strictly enforced whatever the difficulties with the press.  I would
probably arrange, if he looks like lasting for some time, for bulletins everyfourth day.5. I contemplate a reasoned statement by my Government to issue simul-taneously with announcement referred to in paragraph 4 if arid when the fastmaterialises. I shall be telegraphing to you separately text of reply I amsending to his latest, letter, which I have framed so as to make it suitable for publication. &apos; I may have to get his concurrence in publication of our earliercorrespondence since it was marked personal, though his letter of 29th - Januaryshows that no difficulty is likely to arise over that.6. Gandhi&apos;s endeavour to bring in food, national government and possibilityof agreement with Jinnah are complete red herrings of very obvious type. I donot propose to expand on those in my answer to him.(14)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 4th February, 1943.287-S. Personal. My Personal telegram 3rd February : Gandhi. position was discussed at great length in Council. I made the case for keeping Gandhi inconfinement till death and was supported by Chief. While no final decision wastaken, it was clear, however, that remainder of Council were very strongly infavour of release once danger point was reached, though general feeling was infavour of deferring actual decision until it was seen whether Gandhi in factstarted his fast and, if so, howr he looked like standing it. Discussion is to be resumed this evening, but I have little doubt that their conclusion will be as stated, and I should not myself feel justified or think it wise to go against them.2. Council agreed also : (a) that it would be desirable to make a public announcement of the fast once it started; (6) simultaneously to issue a short statement by Government of India commenting; (c) that I should now reply to ghandi&apos;s latest letter.3. I hope to get my reply off to-day or to-morrow and will telegraph its text..I will also ask Gandhrs permission to publish in due course the personal corres-pondence between us, copies of which have already been telegraphed to you. Sometime ago I asked departments here to get together most promising case possibleagainst Congress with a view to publication. All possible steps are being takento expedite completion.of this so that if practicable it can appear as a pamphletor official statement before the 9th February.4. Since telegraphing yesterday I have had views of Bihar, Bengal andOrissa. Lewis appears to favour (b), (c) and (a) in that order. Rutherford, whohas only just taken over, favours (a) on advice of his (? local officers). Herbertalso favours (a).(15)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 5th February, 1943.293-S. Personal. Gandhi fast. Discussion wras resumed in Council this evening. I again affirmed my own preference for allowing him to die in prison,but (in absence of Chief) found no support. Council unanimously favouringrelease when in danger of death. Consequent on suggestion by Firoz, mattersthen took a wholly unexpected turn. Suggestion was put forward, andunanimously accepted by my colleagues, that the best way of dealing with Gandhiwas to deflate him by informing him on evening before fast was clue to begin that(a) Government could have nothing to do with this form of political blackmail,for which they had utmost abhorrence; (b) that they could be no parties to hisapplying coercion by means of fast; (c) that he would therefore be released onstarting a fast for the period of the fast, viz., 21 days (or less), on the under-standing (d) that on its completion he would return to detention.2. No conditions would be imposed. He would be allowed to be accompaniedby those persons at present attached to him; there would be no restraint duringperiod of fast; his position in relation to Government during that period wouldin effect be that he would be on ticket of leave. Government would not take partin discussions of any sort with him.[25025] c 2
3. As regards publicity, statement would be issued by Government of india as originally contemplated, dealing with circumstances of his fast; correspondence between Gandhi and myself would also be released, and no endeavour would he-spared to get Government of India pamphlet about Congress responsibility fordisturbances published by time fast was due to begin or as soon as possibleafterwards.4. ,Chief was absent from to-nigh t&apos;s meeting, at which all other members were present save Jogendra Singh and Sarkar. Maxwell and Raisman bothsupport this proposition. Maxwell does not think that reactions on services willbe unfortunate. Sense of Council was unanimous that, revolutionai-y as this solution might seem, it was best calculated to throw Gandhi out of his stride andto secure us desired results, while avoiding certain of the difficulties that wouldhave to be faced in connection with a fast.5. On a minor point of detail. Council were agreed that it was most desirable that fast should be conducted away from Aga Khan&apos;s palace.6. I am consulting Lumley and other governors and will telegraph their actions as soon as possible.(16)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 5th February. 1943.302-S. Personal. Following is text of Lumley&apos;s comment on revised proposals set out in my telegram of 4th February No. 293-S. Begins: private and personal.1. I think this new proposal offers a better method of dealing with theproblem than any of the others hitherto propounded.2. It appears to me as better tactics, and in my view we shoidd keep thisbusiness on the level of tactics and not principles. Gandhi. I would guess, wants to revive the emotional atmosphere of 9th August, and. as he well knows, a fast isthe best method of doing it. It is our business. I hold, to see that he has theleast possible success. If we keep him in and he dies, he will achieve themaximum effect not only temporarily, but for a long time, for in certain circum-stances Gandhi dead will be a greater menace than Gandhi at large. the objection to keeping him in until imminent danger of death is that at his present age he will probably die. and we would have much the same reaction asif he died in prison. The new proposal avoids all the difficulties of a fast in prison, and removes the affair from the plane of emotional tragedy and brings it down almost to the level of a farce. It will be Gandhi, and not Government, whowill lose most by this.3. It is not easy to forecast what his next move would be : but I think theGovernment action would command considerable support, and the chances of gandhi making a successful emotional appeal would be less.4. The proposal could be criticised as illogical as well as revolutionarv, butI consider it is well worth trying.5. I would expect the services in this Province, the great bulk of whom areHindus, to be in no way upset by this proposal, whereas I am sure that a decisionto keep him in detention till he died would be a shock to many and a considerablestrain, though I would expect them to do their duty as in the past.   Ends.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated 5th February, 1943.304-S. Following is text of letter addressed to M. K. Gandhi, Esq., dated5th February. Begins: Dear Mr. Gandhi. Many thanks for your letter of29th January which 1 have just received. I have read it, as always, with great care and with every anxiety to follow your mind and to do full justice to yourargument. But I fear that my view of responsibility of Congress and of yourselfpersonally for lamentable disorders of last autumn remains unchanged.2. In my last letter I said that my knowledge of facts left me no choice butto regard Congress movement, and you as its authorised and fully empoweredleader at time of decision last August, as responsible for campaign of violence
and crime that subsequently broke out. In reply you have reiterated your request that I should attempt to convince you that my opinion is correct. I would readilyhave responded earlier to that request were it not that your letters gave no indication, such as I should have been entitled to expect, that you sought informa-tion with an open mind. In each of them you have expressed profound distrust,of published reports of recent happenings, although in your last letter, on thebasis of same information, you have not hesitated to lay whole blame for them on Government of India. In same letter you have stated that I cannot expectyou to accept accuracy of official reports on which I rely. It is not thereforeclear to me how you expect or even desire me to convince you of anything. But,in fact, the Government of India have never made any secret of their reasonsfor holding Congress and its leaders responsible for deplorable acts of violence,sabotage and terrorism that have occurred since Congress resolution of(? 8th August) declared a &quot; mass struggle &quot; in support of its demands, appointedyou as its leader and authorised all Congressmen to act for themselves in theevent of interference with leadership of movement. A body which passes aresolution in such terms is hardly entitled to disclaim responsibility for anyevents that followed it. There is evidence that you and your friends expectedthis policy to lead to violence; and that you were prepared to condone it; andthat violence that ensued formed part of a concerted plan, conceived long beforearrest of Congress leaders. The general nature of case against Congress hasbeen publicly stated by Home Member in his speech in Central LegislativeAssembly on 15th September last, and if you need further information I would refer you to it. I enclose a complete copy in case press versions that you musthave seen were not sufficient. I need only add that ail the mass of evidence thathas since come to light has confirmed the conclusions then reached. I have ampleinformation that campaign of sabotage has been conducted under secretinstructions, circulated in name of A.I.C.C.; that well-known Congressmen haveorganised and freely (? taken) part in acts of violence and murder; and that even now an underground Congress organisation exists in which, among others,the wife of a member of Congress Working Committee plays a prominent part,and which is actively engaged in planning bomb outrages and other acts of terrorism that have disgusted whole country. If we do not act on all this informa-tion or make it publicly known, it is because the time is not yet ripe; but you may rest assured that the charges against Congress will have to be met sooner or later, and it will then be for you and your colleagues to clear yourselves beforethe world if you can. And if in the meantime you yourself, by any action suchas you now appear to be contemplating, attempt to find an easy way out, the judgment will go against you by default.3. I have read with some surprise your statement that principle of civildisobedience is implicitly conceded in the Delhi settlement of 5th March, 1931,which you refer to as the &quot; Gandhi-Irwin Pact.&quot; I have again looked at that document. Its basis was that civil disobedience would be &quot; effectively cliseon-tinued,&quot; and that certain &quot; reciprocal action &quot; would be taken by Government.It was inherent in such a document that it.should take notice of existence of civildisobedience. But I can find nothing in it to suggest that civil disobedience was recognised as being in any circumstances legitimate. And I cannot make it tooplain that it is not so regarded by my Government.4. To accept the point of view which you put forward would be to concedethat the authorised Government of the country, on which lies the responsibilityfor maintaining peace and good order, should allow subversive and revolutionarymovements described by you yourself as open rebellion, to take place unchallenged:.;that they should allow preparations for violence, for interruption of communica-tions, for attacks on innocent persons, for murder of police officers and others toproceed unchecked. My Government and I are open, indeed, to the charge thatwe should have taken drastic action at an earlier stage against you and againstCongress leaders (? But) my anxiety and that of my Government has throughoutbeen to give you and to give Congress organisation every possible opportunity towithdraw from position which you have decided to take up. Your statements of last June and July, the original resolution of Working Committee of 14th July,and your declaration on same day that there was no room left for (? negotiation)and that after all it was an open rebellion, are all of them grave and1 significant,even without your final exhortation to &quot; do or die.&quot; But with a patience that was perhaps misplaced, it was decided to wait until the resolution of A.I.C.C. made it clear that there could be no further toleration of Congress attitude if theGovernment was to discharge its responsibility to the people of India.
5. Let me in conclusion say how greatly I regret, having regard to yourhealth and your age. the decision that you tell me that you now have it in mind to take. I hope and pray that wiser counsels may yet prevail with you. But thedecision whether or not to undertake a fast with its attendant risks is clearlyone that must be taken by you alone, and the responsibility for which and for itsconsequences must rest on you alone. T trust sincerely that in the light of what i have said you may think better of your resolution; and I would welcome adecision on your part to think better of it, not only because of my own naturalreluctance to see you wilfully risk your life, but because I regard the use of afast for political purposes as a form of political.,blackmail (&quot; Himsa &quot;) for whichthere can be no moral justification, and understood1 from your own previouswritings that this was also your view.(18)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India datedNew Delhi, 23-55 hours. o&apos;th February. 1943.316-S. Personal. Gandhi. Following is Halletfs reply. Begins: Yourtelegram of 4th February. Gandhi&apos;s fast. (1) Personally I still supportYour Excellences view that he should be kept in confinement, till death : releasewhen in danger of death has little advantage : there would be difficulty of deciding stage at which he was in danger, and there would be constant demands for immediate release : it is fact of release that is important, not time of it.(2) Fact that alternative now suggested has unanimous support of yourCouncil also does affect decision, and this unanimity is of importance. Conditionsproposed are appropriate, but (a) or (b) should be amplified by categoricalstatement that Government will have no discussions with him, also that nodiscussions with Congress detenus or prisoners will be allowed. As regards (n)and (&amp;), there is possibility that he might try to continue fast for more than21 days, and of course prolongation of fast would be most dangerous. There isalso possibility that during 21 days or longer period of fast there might be revival of rebellious activities, ft should therefore be made clear that Governmentmaintained the right to subject him to detention at any time during period revivaloccurred.2. I venture to refer to publicity and to last sentence of my note of2nd February. It is very necessary to stop undue news or comment by means of pre-censorship. Also if large crowds flock to see him it will be necessary to stopthem, and I should make it clear to my officers that there must be no relaxation in action against Congress, and that demonstrations. &amp;c. must be dealt withfirmly.3.   Thus, though with reluctance. I accept alternative.   Ends.Further telegram from Ffallett in continuation of paragraph ISTo. 1 of above is as follows. Begins: I recognise that prolongation of fast, whether he is under detention or on ticket of leave, will undoubtedly make our position more difficult,for it will have a cumulative effect, and specially an emotional effect. The point which I wish to emphasise is that if he is allowed to establish contacts whenunder ticket of leave, which it will be difficult to stop, this, combined withemotional effect of a prolonged fast, increases danger of a revival of movement,and his rearrest on revival is essential.   Ends.(19)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, 7th February, 1943,New Delhi, 03-40 hours.332-S. Personal. My personal telegram 293-S. Gandhi&apos;s fast. matter has again been discussed at great length in Council (Sarkar and Jogendra beingnow present, and Chief the only absentee) in the light of Governors&apos; views,all which have been repeated to you as received. As you will see, Governors aredivided. While Bombay, Bengal, United Provinces (though with reluctance),Punjab, Assam and Orissa support course of action accepted by Council,Madras, Bihar, Central Provinces, and Sincl are strongly opposed. No replyhas yet been received from Cunningham who is out of touch on tour.
2. Certain of the apprehensions felt by dissenting Provinces are based onassumption that fast, if it takes place, may be prolonged. Lumley, however,tells me that given conditions contemplated, his surgeon-general, Candy,estimates that by fifth day Gandhi&apos;s life will be in danger, and his conditionfairly critical. Candy estimates that Gandhi will survive his fast, for ten to-twelve days only. This estimate is based on Candy&apos;s general clinical knowledge and his experience of GandhPs fast ten years ago. He comments that use of fruit juice will be harmful as it increases acidosis. Difference, therefore,between release on danger and present plan is only about a week. It has tobe recognised, too, that whatever solution we find, much popular excitement andlocal difficulty is inevitable at one stage or other. As regards press controlwe can, and intend to, go a very long way to meet Governors&apos; wishes.3. On position as a whole, Council, after full consideration of Governors&apos;views, and with full appreciation of fact that we are taking certain chancesand that there is much that can be said against solution, remain Of opinion withmajority of Governors, that it is worth trying. That is their unanimous view and (while I again reminded them of my own view that the wise course was to let Gandhi take consequences of his decision) I should not feel justified in opposing it.4. We are, therefore, going ahead on these lines. I telegraph separatelytext of statement approved by Council for release in the event of fast. I willalso telegraph to you text of communication to be made to Gandhi on behalfof Government of India on evening of Monday, 8th February. I am particularly-anxious that there should be no leakage or advance communication .to press either at home or here. It would be most unfortunate, if Gandhi were by any chance to call off fast, if it were to get out on Tuesday that he had, in fact, contemplatedor even started one. My arrangements here have been so devised as to prevent any communication or warning of an)7 sort to press until after zero hour for faston Tuesday morning.(20)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary vf State for India, dated New Delhi,03-21 hours, 7th February, 1943.333-S. Personal. My personal telegram 332-S represents outcome ofexhaustive and at times definitely rather tense discussions in Council. I do notpretend to regard that outcome as ideal, and I would have been very glad to have been able to go much further to tie Gandhi down as regards political activityduring his period of freedom if it materialises. But it is of very great importanceindeed, both politically here and, I should imagine, from the point of view of leftwing at home and of U.S.A., to have unanimous support of Council for thispolicy, and to have them unanimously behind statement of which I am tele-graphing text separately. And, whatever my own preferences for letting Gandhistarve to death if he wants to, and. whatever my sympathy for views expressedby minority of Governors, I would not, and did not, feel justified in pressingthem against opposition so decided. Nor could. I have hoped, had I clone so, tohave the requisite support.2. That applies also to question of imposing conditions on Gandhi asregards abstention from political activity while in freedom. View of all of mycolleagues with personal experience of him (and my own experience, I fear,supports it), was that he would in no circumstances accept any conditions. I doubt very much myself whether he will be prepared to accept arrangements nowproposed. But, if be refuses to do so, we are in a much stronger position vis-a-vis of Indian and general world opinion : and if he insists on fasting, therewill be no question of where responsibility lies, or of the fact that he is anxiousto make political capital out of this procedure. I do not believe that he hasscored many points in his correspondence with me (indeed, my letter to him of 5th February, which he will receive to-morrow, is likely to be almost indigestiblystrong meat for certain of my colleagues, and will not be palatable to Gandhi,whom it is certain to provoke to argument- not least on question of his attitudetowards fasting as a political weapon, my remarks on which, based on statements in Harijan, he may well contend, overstate his attitude).3. But main thing is, I still feel, that Government of India as at presentcomposed should be ready with unanimity to take as strong a line as they havedone in a matter so closely touching susceptibilities religious and political and
affecting an individual of Gandhi&apos;s unquestioned eminence and popular appeal;and, while I would gladly have seen him handled still more firmly, I am wellcontent, on a balancing of all disadvantages, with this result. That we may havea great deal of trouble to face, however things go, I do not overlook. But thatwould equally have been the case whether we had favoured ; (a) letting him fast to death, (b) releasing him when in immediate danger, and I am sure that it issounder (and support of so many Governors confirms me in that) to be able to face matters with Council solid behind me. I will do my best to keep dissentientGovernors&apos; minds at ease. T will also telegraph, probably to-morrow, commentand information for Bajpai and Mudaliar.(21)    -Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, datedNew Delhi, 03-20 hours, 7th February, 1943.335-S. Personal. Text of statement is as follows: Begins: Mr. Gandhihas informed His Excellency the Viceroy that he proposes to undertake a fast of3 weeks&apos; duration from 9th February. It is to be a fast according to capacity,and during it Mr. Gandhi proposes to add juices of citrus fruit to water tomake water drinkable, as his wish is not to fast to death, but to survive the ordeal.The Government of India deplore the using weapon of fasting to achieve politicalends. There can, in their judgment, be no justification for it, and Mr. Gandhihas himself admitted in the past that it contains an element of coercion. TheGovernment of India can only express its&quot; regret that Mi&quot;. Gandhi should thinkit necessary to employ such a weapon on this occasion, and should seek a justifica-tion for it in anything which Government may have said or done in connectionwith movement initiated by him and his co-workers in Congress party. TheGovernment of India have no intention on their part of allowing fast to deflecttheir policy. Nor will they be responsible for its consequences on Mr. Gandhi&apos;shealth. They cannot prevent Mr. Gandhi from fasting. -*But if he decides todo so he must do so at his own risk and under his own arrangements for duration of fast and any members of his party living with him who may wish to accompanyhim *The Government of India propose to issue, in due course, a full statement on origin and development of movement which was initiated in August last, and measures which (&apos;( omission) have been compelled to adopt to deal with it, butthey think this is a suitable occasion for a brief review of events of last fewweeks.Mr. Gandhi, in his correspondence with Viceroy, has repudiated allresponsibility for consequences which have flowed from the &quot;quit India&quot;demand which he and Congress party have put forward. This contention willnot bear examination. Mr. Gandhi&apos;s own statement, before movement was launched, envisaged anarchy as an alternative to existing order, and referredto the struggle &quot;as a fight to the finish, in the course of which he would not hesitate to run any risk, however great.&quot; As much has been made of his offer tomeet the Viceroy, it is necessary to point out that at press interview on 14th July,after Working Committee resolution was passed, Mr. Gandhi stated that there* In the statement as finally published the passage between the asterisks read as follows(c./. No. (32)):-It was their wish, however, that if lie decided to do so, he should do so as a free man and under his own arrangements, so as to bring out clearly that the responsibility for anyfast and its consequences rested exclusively with him. They accordingly informedMr. Gandhi that he would be released for the&apos;purpose and for the duration of&apos;the fast ofwhich he had notified them, and with him any members of the party living with him who may wish to accompany him. Mr. Gandhi, however, has expressed his readiness to abandonhis intended fast if released, failing which he will fast in detention. In other words, it isnow clear that only his unconditional release could prevent him from fasting. This theGovernment of India are not prepared to concede. Their position remains the same: that isto say, they are ready to set Mr. Gandhi at liberty for the purpose and duration of his fast.But if Mr. Gandhi is not prepared to take advantage of that fact and if he fasts while in detention, he does so solely on his own responsibility and at his own risk. He would he at liberty in that event to have his own medical attendants, and also to receive visits fromfriends with the permission of the Government during its period.
was no room left in the proposal for withdrawal or negotiation; there was noquestion of one more chance; after all, it was an open rebellion, which was tobe as short and as swift as possible. His last message was &quot; do or die.&quot; the speeches of those most closely associated with Mr. Gandhi have been even moreexplicit, and have given a clear indication of what Congress High command had in mind in launching their attack an attack which would if realised havemost seriously imperilled the whole cause of the United Nations against government as by law established, and against the agencies and services by whichfiie life of the country was being conducted in a period, be it noted, of exceptional stress and strain, and of grave danger to India from (? japanese aggression.The instructions issued by various Congress organisations, contained inleaflets which were found to be freely circulating in almost every part of India and which, on evidence, cannot all be disowned as unauthorised gave specificdirections as to methods which were to be employed for bringing administration to a standstill. The circular of 29th July emanating from Andhra ProvincialCongress (corrupt group) is an instance in point. It is noteworthy in thisconnection that in wddely separated areas all over the country identical methodsof attacks on railways and other communications were employed, inquiring useof special implements and high technical knowledge. Control rooms and blockinstruments in railway stations came in for special attention, and destructionof telegraph and telephone lines arid equipment was carried out in a manner which denoted careful planning and close knowledge of their working. If thesemanifestations of rebellious activities are to be regarded as the result not of congress teachings, but as a manifestation of popular i&apos;esentrnent against arrest of Mr. Gandhi and Congress Leaders, the question may well be asked to which section of public the tens of thousands of men engaged in the violent and subver-sive activities belonged. If it is claimed that it is not Congressmen who havebeen responsible, it would be extraordinary, to say the least, if blame were to belaid on non-Congress elements. The country is, in effect, asked to believe thatthose who own allegiance to Congress party have behaved in an exemplary nonviolent manner, and that it is persons who are outside the Congress fold whohave been register (? omission) (? resentment) at arrest of leaders of a movementwhich they did not profess to follow. A more direct answer to argument is to be had in fact that known Congressmen have been repeatedly found engaged inincitements to violence, or in prosecuting Congress activities which have led todisorders.That political parties and groups outside the Congress party have nodelusions on the subject may be judged from the categorical way in which theyhave disassociated themselves from movement, and condemned violence to whichit has given rise. In particular, the Moslem League has, on more than one occasion, emphasised the character and intentions of policy pursued by congress party. As early as (? 20th August) last, the Working Committee of the Leagueexpressed the view, reiterated many times since that by the slogan &quot; quit India &quot;what was really meant was supreme control of Government of the country by congress, and that the mass civil disobedience movement had resulted in lawless-ness and considerable destruction of life and property. Other elements in political life of country have expressed themselves in a similar vein, and if followers of congress persist in their contention that resultant violence was not part of theirpolicy or programme, they are doing so against weight of overwhelming evidence.Mr. Gandhi in his letter to Viceroy has sought to fasten responsibility on government of India. The Government of India emphatically repudiate thissuggestion. It is clearly preposterous to contend that it is they who areresponsible for the violence of the last few months which so gravely disorganisedthe normal life of (corrupt group), incidentally aggravated difficulties of food situation at a time when (? united) energies of people might have been devotedto vital task of repelling enemy and of striking a blow for freedom of India, theCommonwealth and the World.[25025d
ISTelegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy [dated 7th February, 1943.2360. Personal. Your personal telegrams 332-S, 333-S, 335-S and earliertelegrams were considered by Cabinet this afternoon immediately on PrimeMinisters return. After full discussion the Cabinet decided that they could notappove action on lines proposed without further consideration.Please therefore suspend action proposed until you hear further from us.Telegram setting out War Cabinefs views and putting certain urgent questions will follow shortly. We have not yet received text of proposed communication to ghandi.Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Viceroy jdated 8th February, 1943.2361. Personal. See my telegram 2360. Following are the views of the WarCabinet : 1. War Cabinet are greatly disturbed by certain features of your new scheme. In the first place, while we agreed with reluctance to your proposalendorsed by your colleagues that Gandhi should be let out of detention as soon asthe doctors advised that this should be done to prevent his dying in detention, wehave never agreed to a proposal that he should be let out of detention on a merethreat to fast; and. moreover, a threat to fast to capacity and not to death. we feel that this new proposal will result in grave embarrassment.2. Our anxieties are increased because, as we understand it, the newsuggestion involves an undertaking by Gandhi to return to detention after hisfast is over. You do not tell us what you propose to do if he refuses to give theundertaking. Are your colleagues prepared, in that event, to let him fast to death in detention&apos;! Again, if after release he stops his fast, is he to bere-detained at once ? What steps would you propose to take to implementHalletCs conditions in his 316-S ?3. War Cabinet see very strong objection to any arrangement or under-standing with Gandhi. Whatever action is taken should be action taken by theGovernment of India without regard to gandhis consent or acquiescence.4. War Cabinet also greatly dislike any form of cat and mouse. i.e., theidea that Gandhi should in any circumstances be let out for a period and then putback again without fresh cause. This is a quite different thing from re-detainingon fresh grounds a man who has been released because of his state of health, whichis the very utmost we ever contemplated as possible.5. We have noted that your own view, supported by several Governors, is that ghandi should not get released by merely threatening to limit his diet to citrousjuice or actually starving himself, and that if he chooses to do this he should noton that account alone be released. You can rely on receiving effective support from the War Cabinet if you were to maintain this view, or as stated in my tele-gram 44 of 12th January, if you contemplated a release only at point when clangerto life is involved.6. The question which troubles the War Cabinet most is the public reaction to the release of Gandhi because of his threat. The draft in your 335-S of a public announcement, though naturally framed in the light of its probable reception inIndia, appears to us to be equivalent to a statement that the Government feelsbound to yield to Gandhi &apos;s threat, and would surely convey to the world a most fortunate impression of weakness.7. We realise that you feel pressed for time. But surely it is better to havea day or two&apos;s delay, rather than to rush a decision on a new idea which is so full of difficulties, both present and piDspective, even though this means that Gandhistarts his threatened capacity fast in detention? We ask you to send us yourfurther observations urgently in the light of this telegram.
(24)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated New Delhi,22-55 hours, 7th February, 1943.346-S. Following is text of confidential letter from Home Department to ghandi, which will be delivered to him at 6 p.m. Monday 8th February : Begins: Dated 7th February. Dear Mr. Gandhi, the Government of india have been (? informed) by Flis Excellency the Viceroy of your intention as com-municated to him (corrupt group) undertake a fast for 21 days in certain circum-stances. They have carefully considered position, and the conclusions that theyhave reached in the light of such considerations are set out in the statement ofwhich a copy is enclosed which they would propose, in. the event of yourmaintaining your present intention, to release in due course to the press.2. The Government of India, as you will see from their statement, would bevery reluctant to see your fast, and I am instructed to inform you that, as thestatement makes clear, they would propose that, should you persist in yourintention, you will be set at liberty for the purpose, and for the duration, ofyour fast as from time of its commencement.During period of your fast there will be no objection to you proceeding where you wish, though the Government of India trust that you will be able to arrangefor your accommodation away from the Aga Khan&apos;s palace.3. - Should you for any reason find yourself unable to take advantage of these arrangements, a decision which the Government of India would greatly regret,they will of course suitably amend the statement of which a copy is now enclosedbefore it issues. But they wish me to repeat, with all earnestness, their anxietyand their hope that considerations which have carried so much weight with them will equally carry weight with you, and that you will not,pursue your presenttentative proposal. In that event, no occasion will of course arise for issue (? ofany) statement of any kind.   Signed : Yours sincerely, R. Tottenham. Ends.We do not at this stage contemplate publishing that letter, but it may ofcourse be necessary (? to do) so later(25)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated New- Delhi,23-50 hours, 7th February, 1943.348-S. Personal. . Gandhi&apos;s fast. Press arrangements. I have askedLumley to let the Governors, Chief Commissioners and Residents know by codeword whether Gandhi (a) calls off his fast (b) accepts our proposals (c) insists onignoring our proposals and fasting. They are to do their best to take the presswith them and arrange meeting of Provincial Press Advisory Committee and/oreditors on the day which the news breaks for a time 5 hours after (1 receipt of)code word in events, (? of) (b) and (c) above.2. Conference to be told that while bulletins about Gandhi&apos;s health and reasonable editorial comment will be allowed, we do not, for security reasons,intend to allow publication of statements by or interviews with Gandhi orplaying up of the situation so as to enlist public sympathy for (? Gandhi) or workup feeling against the Government (? &amp;c), and if necessary orders under DefenceRules will be passed to that effect.(26)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated- New Delhi.14-30 hours, 8th February. 1943.355-S. Personal. Following is text of Mr. Gandhrs letter, dated7th February, 1943 : Begins: Dear Linlithgow. I have to thank you for your longreply, dated the 5th instant, to my letter of 29th January last. I would take yourlast point first, namely, the contemplated fast which begins On 9th instant. your letter, from a Satyagrahi&apos;s standpoint, is an (? invitation) to fast. No doubt theresponsibility for step, and its consequences, will be solely mine.   You. have[25025] d 2
allowed an expression to (? slip) from your pen for which I was not unprepared.In concluding sentence of second paragraph you describe the stop as an attemptto find an easy way out.&quot; That you. as a friend, can impute such a, base andcowardly motive (? to me) passes comprehension. You have also described it as&quot; a form of political blackmail.&quot; And you quote my previous writings on thesubject against me. We might abide by my writings. I hold that there is nothinginconsistent in them with contemplated step. I wonder whether you have yourself(? read) those writings.I do claim that 1 have approached you with an open mind when I asked (? you to) convince me of my error. &quot; Profound distrust &quot; of published reports is in no way inconsistent with my having an open mind.You say that there is evidence that, J I leave my friends out for themoment &quot;&apos; expected this policy to lead to violence,&quot; that I was &quot;prepared tocondone it.&quot; and that &quot; the violence that ensued formed part of a concerted planconreived long before arrest of Congress leaders.&quot; I have seen no evidence insupport of such a serious charge. You admit that part of evidence has yet to bepublished. The speech of Home Member, of which you have favoured me with acopy, may be taken as opening speech of prosecuting Counsel and nothing more.It contains unsupported imputations against Congressmen. Of course, he hasdescribed the violent outburst in graphic language. But he has not said why it took place -when it did. You have condemned men and women before trying themand hearing their defence. Surely there is nothing wrong in my asking you toshow me evidence on which you hold them guilty. What you say in your lettercarries no conviction. Proof should correspond to canons of English juris-pruclence.If wife of a member of Working Committee is actively engaged in &quot; planningbomb outrages and other acts of terrorism,&quot; she should be tried before a courtof law and punished if found guilty. The lady you refer to could only have donethings attributed to her after wholesale arrests of 9th August last, which 1 havedared to describe as leonine violence.:You say that time is not yet ripe to publish the charges against Congress.Have you ever thought of possibility of their being found guiltless when theyare put before an impartial tribunal? or that some of the condemned personsmight have died in the meantime, or that some of the evidence that the living can produce might become available ?I reiterate the statement that the principle of civil disobedience is implicitlyconceded in settlement of (? September) 1931, arrived at between the then Viceroyon behalf of Government of India and myself on behalf of Congress. I hope you know that principal Congressmen were discharged before that settlement was even thought of. Certain reparations were made to Congressmen under that settlement. Civil disobedience was discontinued only on conditions beingfulfilled by the Government. That by itself was. in my opinion,\an acknowlegement-ment of its legitimacy, of course under given circumstances. It therefore seemssomewhat strange to find you maintain that civil disobedience &quot; cannot berecognised as being in any circumstances legitimate &quot; by your Government. Youignore the practice of British Government (? which has) recognised thislegitimacy under the name of &quot; passive resistance.&quot;Lastly, you read into my letters a meaning which is wholly inconsistent withmyv declaration, in one of them of adherence to unadulterated non-violence. For.you say in your letter under reply that &quot; acceptance of my point of view would beto concede that authorised Government of the country, on which lies theresponsibility for maintaining peace and good order, should allow movements totake place that would admit preparations for violence, interruption of communications, for attacks on innocent persons, for murders of police officersand others to proceed unchecked.&quot; I might be a strange friend of yours whomyou believe to be capable of (? asking) for recognition of such things as lawful.I have not attempted an exhaustive reply to views and statements attributed to me. This is not the place nor time for such a reply. I have only picked outthose things which in my opinion demanded an immediate answer. You have left me no loophole for escape from the ordeal I have set before myself.. I beginit on 9th instant with clearest possible conscience. Despite your description ofit as &quot; a form of political blackmail,&quot; it is on my part meant to be an appeal tohighest tribunal for justice which (? I have) failed to secure from you. If I donot survive the ordeal, I shall go to judgment seat with fullest faith in myinnocence. Posterity will judge between you as representative of an all-powerfulGovernment and me as a humble man who has tried to (? omission) for his regularcountry and humanity through it.
My Last letter was written (? against) (? time), and therefore a materialparagraph went in as postscript. I now send herewith a fair copy typed byPeareo Mai, who has taken Mahadeo Desai&apos;s place. You will find the postcriptparagraph restored to place where it should have been. I am your sincere friendM. K- Gandhi. Ends.(27)Telegram from. Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated Neiv Delhi17-30 hours, 8th February, 1943.359-S. Personal. Halletfs telegram, dated 5th February, G. 314* Thereis not the slightest hope of Gandhi accepting any conditions such as these my council, after fullest discussion, are clear that they cannot be (? imposed on) Wehave got to take certain risks in this business, and I am quite prepared to takethe risk involved m leaving this matter open. If Gandhi is going to fast he willnot be able to do (? much) in the way of discussion.(28)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated New Delhi,17-30 hours, 8th February, 1943.362-S. Personal. Your personal telegram dated 8th February. I fully appreciate feeling of the War Cabinet, and have most carefully considered their proposal.   I have again discussed the matter in Council.2. Council remain entirely firm in support of their proposal. They fully recognise and have given weight to the considerations advanced by the Cabinet.They remain, however, quite clear that their decision is a wise one, and that is their considered advice to the Cabinet. WThile I have consistently made it clearthat I would myself prefer to allow Gandhi to take the consequences of his decision without releasing him, I would not feel justified in differing from the unanimous view of my Council on this matter, and I support it.3.   I think that certain of the Cabinefs doubts are due to obscure draftinghere.(a) There will be no arrangement or understanding with Gandhi. his release, after fast begins, will be our counter-move to fast, and hewill be left no choice.-(6) (? There is no) question of release on a threat. He will only be releasedif and when he actually commences the fast.(c) Gandhi&apos;s (? return to) detention.    We have carefully phrased our(? communication) to make it clear that he is released at the outset of his fast for the purpose and duration of his fast. Release will bemerely an interruption of his confinement for a specific period. Ifconsequent on that decision he leaves the Aga Khan&apos;s palace andsurvives the fast, neither I nor any of my colleagues with experienceof him have any doubt that he would return to detention on its completion. Physical reasons might of course make a (? slight) delayinevitable. But he becomes a (? prisoner) again once his fast ends,and we can make necessary arrangements in advance (two corruptgroups) whether he is in Aga Khan&apos;s palace or not.(d) If he is (? not) (? prepared to) leave the Aga Khan&apos;s palace, that is his affair, as our statement makes clear. In that (? event) he will beallowed to remain there; but technically during the period of his fast as a free man (? any) Restrictions on his liberty will be removed. if in that event he refuses to make his own arrangements for doctors,miscellaneous comforts, &amp;c, we will of course make them for him.((?) My colleagues are entirely satisfied that public (? reaction) is likelyto be as good and probably better to this solution than to any other.They fully recognise that serious difficulties will have to be facedwhatever solution we adopt, but they are solidly behind this one.4. Finally, we are not masters of time-table in this matter. Gandhi islikely to start his fast at 5 a.m. Indian time to-morrow. Our letter to Gandhiis scheduled to be handed to him at 6 p.m. Indian time this evening.    My* Printed ns No (18).
colleagues are unanimous of opinion, and I agree with them, that we shouldbe in an exceedingly weak position if, once fast starts, we appear to the public to have no scheme ready for dealing with it despite the warning that had beengiven us, and if we have to try to catch up a couple of days later, by which timethe advantages of the scheme favoured by my Council might have been sacrificed;5. My considered view is, therefore, as stated above. Given the time factor, my colleagues and 1 feel and trust that explanations we have given willmeet the Cabinefs difficulties, and in that confidence, and given the difficulty about timing referred to above, we propose to go ahead.(29)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated New Delhi,17-30 hours, 8th February, 1943.356-S. Personal. I should greatly regret it if trouble were to arise over this business of Gandhi&apos;s fasting. But I (? trust) that Cabinet, to whom i hope you will show this telegram, will believe that I have done my utmost tocover the points raised by them, and that, in my considered judgment, over-ruling of my Council on this matter would have disastrous consequences here and might be, indeed, dangerous to our whole war effort. My own views have always been clear. They are, that Gandhi shoidd be allowed to fast to death.That has been brought out consistently in my telegrams (I do not understandsuggestion in paragraph 1 of your telegram of 8th February, 2301. that this is&quot;my&apos;&quot; proposal). My entirely personal view is that Gandhi is likely to insist on starving himself to death in Aga Khan&apos;s Palace, and tone of his reply tomy letter of 5th February, which I am telegraphing separately, confirms that.That makes immediate action here all the more necessary and 1 trust that evenif Cabinet do feel some doubt as to wisdom of course that has been adopted1 can look for their support over it.(30)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated New Delhi,09-40 hours, 9th February, 1943.383-S. Personal. Following is report from Governors Secretary, Bombay,of developments as regards Gandhi. Begins: I delivered Sir R. Tottenham&apos;sletter to Mr. Gandhi at 6 p.m. to-day. It was a clay of silence and he gave mewritten note asking me to call again at 9-0 p.m. As Mr. Gandhi observes oldtime this meant 10 0 p.m. Accordingly I called, on him at 10-0 p.m., when hehanded me a written reply addressed to Sir R. Tottenham. The terms of the reply are as follows : Detention Camp dated 8th February. Dear Sir Richard,I have very carefully studied your letter. I am sorry to say that there is nothing in correspondence which has taken place between His Excellency and myself oryour letter to warrant a re-calling of my intention to fast. T have mentioned,in my letters to His Excellency the conditions which can induce prevention orsuspension of step.If temporary release is offered for my convenience, I do not need it. I shallbe quite content to take my fast as a detenu, or prisoner. If it is for (lieconvenience of the Government I am sorry I am unable to suit them, much asI should like to do so. I can say this much, that I as a prisoner shall avoid, asfar as is humanly possible, every cause of inconvenience to the Government, savewhat is inherent in fast itself. The impending fast has not been conceived to betaken as a free man. Circumstances may arise, as they have done before now,when I may have to fast as a free man. If therefore I am (? released), (? therewill be no) fast in (? terms) (? of my) correspondence above-mentioned. I shallhave to survey the situation de novo and decide what I should do. I have no desire to be released under false pretences. In spite of all that has been saidagainst me. I hope not to belie the vow of truth and non-violence which alonemakes life livable for me. I say this, if it is only for my own satisfaction. Itdoes me good to reiterate openly my faith, when outer darkness surrounds me,as it does just now.I must not hustle the Government into a decision on this letter. I understand,that your letter has been dictated through the telephone. In order to give theGovernment enough time I shall suspend fast, if necessary, to Wednesday next,.10th instant.
So far as^statement proposed to be issued by Government is concerned, andof which you have favoured me with a copy, I can have no opinion. But if I.might have, I must say that it does me an &quot;injustice. The proper course wouldbe to publish full correspondence and let the public judge for themselves. Yourssincerely, M. K. Gandhi.   Ends.I drew Mr. Gandhi&apos;s attention to sentence regarding a possible suspension of his fast till Wednesday next; and after a brief &quot;discussion recorded followingnote in which Mr. G. concurred. Begins-. Mr. Gandhi agreed to postpone hisfast for twenty-four hours on my indicating that I thought this course would assist Government of India in considering his reply. Ends.2. Matter was considered in Council for three hours early this morning and will be further considered at 10.30 a.m. I will then telegraph furtherBut Gandhi&apos;s response has materially altered position inside Council. Voting(the Chief and Ambedkar were absent) was 50/50 as between retention till deathand retention until danger point. But I think latter is likely to prevail atfurther meeting mentioned above. Meantime, as you will have seen, I have warnedChungking and Washington and also. Governors that zero hour has been postponed for twenty-four hours.(31)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, datedNew Delhi. 18-00 hours, 9th February, 1943.386-S. I have telegraphed Gandhi&apos;s reply to Government of India letterof 7th February. Matter was discussed at great length this morning, following on equally lengthy Council meeting at midnight last night.2. In the result, after very considerable discussion and marked divergence ofopinion, Council approved amendment of Government of India statement in terms which have been telegraphed to you in my telegram 387-S.3. I put to Council in terms issue of (a), releasing Gandhi when in dangerof death; (&amp;), holding him.By a majority, decision was in favour of holding him now that he had refusedour offer to enlarge him for the period of the fast. Mody, Sultan Ahmed, Aney,Sarkar, Jogendra Singh were the minority. Commander-in-Chief was away;otherwise full attendance. Once vote showed them to be in a minority, dissentingmembers indicated that, they might have to consider their position. I told themthat that must be for them to decide, but that there could be no question of re-opening of the decision which had been taken by clear majority of the Council,and that I could not delay going ahead with my instructions to Provinces, &amp;c. (Ihad earlier emphasised extreme importance of united front by Council, whateverour internal differences of view.) I rather doubt myself, though may be wrong,if we shall hear much more of this for the moment. But if and when Gandhiis reported to be critically ill and in danger of death we may then be faced withpossibility of resignations on the ground that Government of India are notprepared to set him at liberty unconditionally. We do not propose to say anything in our statement about our intention to hold him or release him.4. Solidarity of Council, which was exceptionally marked in support of our previous decision, had, as you will see, been considerably shattered by Ganclhi&apos;reply.5. In the interests of getting Council unanimously behind our present policy it proved necessary : (a) to agree to reference in statement to Gandhibeing allowed to have his own medical attendants if he fasts and also visits fromfriends with permission of Government. That proviso, if he cares, which I doubt,to take advantage of this facility, will enable us to control undesirable visitors.I made it clear that I could not agree to any person under confinement being madeavailable to go to see him. (b) It was also necessary, though somewhat illogically,to maintain the facade that Government of India&apos;s position is unchanged, andthat, if he wishes to be at liberty for the purpose of his fast, he still can be. I seelittle likelihood myself of him taking advantage of that.6. New decision is a great deal tidier, and has solid majority of (? support)behind it. But division was rather on communal lines, and I should not be surprised if we had a good deal of trouble later. Unless Gandhi, on receipt ofour acknowledgment, text of which I am telegraphing to you separately, of his letter of yesterday, decides to call off fast, it may be assumed that original time-
table will operate as from to-morrow morning with modification that I gatherfast is now likely to start about 8 a.m. Indian time. I will telegraph separatelyabout press. Arrangements for despatch of code-word remains as before. Pendingits receipt, it is of vital importance to maintain complete secrecy (which wouldbe equally important in very improbable contingency of Gandhi calling off fastat last moment). I do not propose to publish Tottenham&apos;s letter to Gandhi of 7th February, Gandhi&apos;s reply of 7th February, and Tottenham&apos;s reply to thatreply of 8th February. In both cases letters from Government of India have been marked confidential.(32)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India datedNew Delhi. 19-20 hours, 9th February. 1943.387-S.Addressed to Secretary of State for India, repeated to Washington.Following amendments approved by Council to-day in Government of Indiastatement, draft of which you have already received :  In paragraph No. 1 omit from words &quot; but if he decides to do so &quot; to endof paragraph.Substitute: t: It was their wish, however, that if he decided to do so, heshould do so as a free man and under his own arrangements, so as to bring outclearly that the responsibility for any fast and its consequences rested exclusivelywith him. They accordingly informed Mr. Gandhi that he would be released for the purpose and for the duration of fast of which he had notified them, andwith him any members of party living with him who may wish to accompanyhim. Mr. Gandhi (corrupt group) has expressed his readiness to abandon hisintended fast if released, failing which he will fast in detention. In other(I words) it is now clear that only his unconditional release could prevent him from fasting. This the Government of India are not prepared to concede. their position remains-the same: that is to say. they are ready to set Mr. Gandhi at liberty for the purpose and duration of his fast. But if Mr. Gandhi is notprepared to take advantage of that fact and if he fasts while in detention, he does so solely on his own responsibility and at his own risk. He would be at liberty in that event to have his own medical attendants, and also to receive visitsfrom friends with permission of Government during its period.&quot;
