THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 97.March 5, 1943.WAR CABINET.THE  INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF  PRIMARY PRODUCTS.Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio.1. WHEN the War Cabinet considered on the 1st May, 1942 (W.M. (42)55th Conclusions, No. 1), the subject of external monetary and economic policy they had before them a memorandum by myself (W.P. (42) 159) on the subject of aproposal to create an International Clearing Union. The Annex to that memo-randum alludes (paragraph 15) to other possible international schemes, includingcommodity control schemes, as follows :  &quot; The United States Administration has shown itself greatly pre-occupied with schemes for the regulation of production, marketing and priceof primary commodities. There is much to be said for an attempt at aninternational organisation for steadying the prices of primary products andthe holding of buffer stocks a plan designed, inter alia, to limit thenecessity for individual restriction schemes with all the international frictionthey engender. The drawing of such a plan is now nearing completion, andwhen it is ready it is proposed to ask Ministers whether this subject shouldbe introduced into the discussions.&quot;2. The Committee on Reconstruction Problems has accordingly had underconsideration a scheme for the international regulation of primary products. Acopy of the scheme, in the form finally approved by the Committee for presentation to the War Cabinet, is attached.3. One of the major economic problems of the period 1919-39 was the marked fluctuations, both short-term and long-term, in the prices received byproducers of primary products throughout the world. Many attempts were madeby producers, alone or with the support of Governments, to stabilise prices atremunerative levels, but they met with only very limited success. The problem is bound to present itself again after the War, possibly in an aggravated form.4. The attached scheme provides for the setting up of international com-commodity controls of primary products, or groups of allied primary products, these controls being co-ordinated under a General Council (working through a GeneralExecutive) which each of the United Nations shall be invited to join as member states. It would be the function of the General Executive to receive periodicreports of their operations from each of the commodity controls, to review theircondition and, if necessary, to make recommendations as to the policy which theyshould follow. Such recommendations would have as their object the protectionof the general interest, and especially the maintenance of a stable level of generalprices and the control of the trade cycle.5. Each commodity control would be concerned only with that part of output which is available for export, and regulation schemes would have to be framed so as to leave each country free to give subsidies, direct or indirect, toits producers, in order to maintain their standard of living at the level which it considers proper, though it would be important to secure a general understandingthat subsidies should be moderate and limited to produce consumed as well asproduced at home.[251361
6. The scheme provides that a commodity control may, with the approval ofthe General Executive, establish a Buffer Stock accompanied by provisions to stabilise prices within a certain range. The object of the control would be to discover by empirical methods a range of prices within which supply and demand would be in equilibrium when the influence of excessive short-period fluctuationshad been smoothed away. It would operate by establishing an initial basic priceon a uniform c.i.f. basis and by offering to buy a commodity at a price (say)10 per cent, below the basic price and to sell at a price (say) 10 per cent, abovethe basic price. The Control should be prepared (subject to certain safeguards)to take any -supplies offered to it at the lower limit. The basic price would be modified from time to time by a. process of trial and error with a view to keeping the size of the Buffer Stock within a defined range. The basic price would not mean a single price, but a complex of prices, according to varieties of quality,dates in relation to the crop year (in the case of agricultural commodities) andpositions relative to cost of transport: a complex similar to those already established by trade practice.7. Cases will arise where the use of the price mechanism, aided only by-Buffer Stocks, -would be inadequate, because, if forced to its logical conclusion, itmight result in bringing the price appropriate to the state of supply and demandbelow a level which producers could be expected to tolerate. If it were merelythat the price mechanism worked too slowly the provisions for the temporaryquota-regulation of exports might suffice. But for an obstinate disequilibriumbetween supply and demand, at a price level reasonably tolerable to producers, itmight be necessary to fall back on the organised restriction of production.8. The scheme therefore makes provision for the imposition in suitable cases of a quota regulation of exports, accompanied by control of stocks and,where practicable, by regulation of production, bid before approving any suchrestriction scheme the General Executive would endeavour to deal with the radical causes of the problem, e.g., subsidies, high tariffs or other forms ofprotection or uneconomic competition from substitute products. Where thecause was the impoverished condition of potential consumers, the GeneralExecutive should consider whether it were practicable to subsidise the consump-tion of the product in impoverished countries.9. The duration of any restriction scheme should not exceed five years inthe first instance, and if it were renewed on the ground that there was stillserious over-supply, the basic price for the next period of five years should bereduced by the General Executive, unless special reason could be shown by the commodity control, to the satisfaction of the General Executive.10. A pivotal question is the finance of Buffer Stocks, for which large sumsmight be required. Finance required by the several controls should be consoli-dated in the hands of the General Executive. It might be obtained through aninternational commodity loan secured on the Buffer Stocks, and it must beremembered that a large part of the finance required is not new, but is already provided from private or public sources. There would be great advantages indamping down the violence of booms and slumps in general economic activity ifthe fluctuating margin of the finance could be handled through the account of theGeneral Executive with such a body as the proposed Clearing Union. Forpurchasing power would be continuously withdrawn from the rest of the ClearingUnion system during the development of boom conditions, when the buffer stocks were being sold, and would be continuously augmented during the onset of a slumpwhen surplus production was being bought by the controls.11. No estimate can be framed of the total volume of finance likely to berequired before the range of the system and the quantity of stocks for eachControl are determined, but the total value of a years international trade foreight principal commodities (wheat, maize, sugar, coffee, cotton, wool, rubber and tin) is estimated to have been taking the average volume for the years 1935-38 about  700 million at the prices of 1939, and  950 million at the prices of 1942.As a year&apos;s stock would, generally speaking, be much too high and three months&apos;would probably be too low, some figure intermediate between these extremes mightbe appropriate. Figures taken from &quot; The Network of World Trade &quot; (Leagueof Nations) indicate that stocks equal to six months&apos; exports of a wide range of primary products could be carried (at 1938 prices) with aggregate finance of (say)12,500 million.
12. The Memorandum points out that the proposals which it outlines assume.a measure of international discipline and good neighbourliness and, in general, a readiness of Governments to accept proper&apos; standards of international behaviourwhich did not exist before the War. They also depend on the effective substitu-tion of an expansionist for a con traction ist pressure on world demand through the better management of the supply of international money. It concludes with thefollowing words :  &apos;L Yet a better ordering of our affairs may not be so difficult as it looksif we tackle it boldly. The gluts which have disorganised production in thepast have been small in relation to actual output and still smaller in relationto potential demand, and the disorder they have caused has been disproportionate-tionate to its origin. It is not true that the impulse of individuals to toiland to produce exceeds their readiness to enjoy and to consume, or that wehave reached standards of life so high that our concern should be to hold backoutput and curb the bounty of nature. It is rather the task of this generationto devise, by taking thought, an organisation which allows escape from aninsane paradox by bringing production and consumption into a fruitfulunion.&quot;13. The Reconstruction Problems Committee agree that these proposals should be submitted to the War Cabinet with a recommendation for their acceptance as a basis for discussion with the United States of America and other-members of the United Nations. The Committee desire to suggest that theattached document might be used in connection with the informal talks which are about to take place with the United States representatives under Article 7 of the mutual Aid Agreement or on any other suitable occasion, as representing ourpreliminary suggestions on the problem; and that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be invited to communicate a copy of the proposals to theChinese and Russian Governments at the appropriate time and also to any othermembers of the United Nations.W.

SECRETR.P. (43) 12.(Also U.S.E. (43) 3 (Final).)February 6. 1943.WAR CABINET.Committee on Reconstruction Problems.THE INTERNATIONAL REGULATION OF PRIMARY PRODUCTS.I.Preface.AN international scheme to regulate primary products must be designed topromote the objects specified in the fourth and fifth points of the Atlantic Charter,which read :  &quot; Fourth, they will endeavour, with due respect for their existing obligations, to further the enjoyment by all States, great and small, victoror vanquished, of access, on equal terms, to the trade and to the raw materials of the world, which are needed for their economic prosperity.&quot; Fifth, they desire to bring about the fullest collaboration between all nations in the economic field with the object of securing for all improvedlabour standards, economic advancement and social security.&apos;&apos;2. Before the War, and especially in the thirties, primary producerssuffered grievously from several causes :  (a) The prices of their products fluctuated violently within the same year,with the result that stock-holding became too risky for merchants and stocks tended to accumulate in the hands of producers.(b) They were subject to periodic slumps when prices fell below what could provide a reasonable standard of life.(c) Their relative inability, compared with industrial producers, to curtailoutput exposed them, even more than the latter, to the effects offluctuations in demand, and the prices of their products tended to fall in relation to the prices of the final products which they werebuying.(d) Their difficulties were aggravated in some important cases through excesscapacity created by the subsidisation of high-cost production, whichwas doubly injurious because, being accompanied (as a rule) by tariffor other restrictions against lower-cost imports, it restrictedconsumption as well as increased supply.(e) As a result of all this, the general depression of the decade before theWar produced outstanding instances of chronic surpluses, actual and potential, where the world&apos;s economic system failed to discover means to enjoy the full abundance of the earth.The measures of regulation which were improvised to deal with particular cases of difficulty had varying degrees of merit. But it cannot be claimed for mostof them that they were sufficient or satisfactory or successful.3. The remedies for these evils, which we may hope to apply after the war,must take various forms. But, apart from general measures to control the tradecycle and to remove impediments to trade, they should include a direct attack onthe problems of primary producers. The outlines of proposals to this end are discussed below. The details of any scheme must be governed by the special problems and requirements of the particular commodity in view. No plan canclaim to be applicable to all commodities. Nevertheless, for a wide range of commodities certain general principles of operation can, it is suggested, be usefully prescribed and agreed.11975   [24846]   [25064] b
4. Regulation Schemes can have either or both of two distinct objectives :(a) the moderation of excessive short-term fluctuations of prices about the long-term equilibrium price, and (b) the maintenance of long-term equilibrium betweensupply and demand at a price level which provides to the majority of the producers a standard of life in reasonable relation to the standards of thecountries in which they live.5. The extent of the evil to be remedied under the first objective can scarcely be exaggerated, though it is not always appreciated. In the absenceof regulation, a comparatively small excess of visible supplies, which has to betaken by an unwilling market, causes a disproportionate collapse of price, andan equally small deficiency of supplies causes prices to rocket upwards. A study of the violence of individual price fluctuations and the inability of an unregulatedcompetitive system to avoid them (even when it is tempered, as it was in the caseof rubber from 1934 onwards, by an International Regulation Scheme) is givenin Appendix I. It is there shown that for the four commodities rubber, cotton,wheat and lead which arc fairly representative of raw materials marketed incompetitive conditions, the civerage animal price range over the decade before1938 was 67 per cent, An orderly programme of output, either of raw materialsthemselves or of their manufactured products, is not possible in such conditions.If arrangements could be made by which temporary surpluses could be absorbed in a buffer stock and held firmly till they could be released to meet a subsequentincrease of demand, the first objective would be met.6. Buffer stocks have the purpose of steadying prices and are intended, as their name implies, to absorb shocks. By this means prices should be confined, ifpossible, within a reasonable range over short periods; provided, however, thatthey remain subject to gradual changes, those producers who find the ruling priceattractive being allowed a gradual expansion at the expense of those who find it unattractive. We should aim at combining a short-period stabilisation of prices with a long-period price policy which balances supply and demand and allowsa steady rate of expansion to the cheaper-cost producers. In this way we can hope to strike a balance between a reasonable measure of security to the producer and adequate provision for peaceful evolutionary change. The relative advantagesbetween one source of supply and another are constantly shifting, owing to changes in public taste, technological advances, improved transport facilities toplaces formerly inaccessible and adoption of substitutes, natural or artificial. Itmay be advisable to retard these natural currents, but it would be a mistake, andprobably futile, to resist them permanently.7. If, however, there is a prospect of a persisting disequilibrium which fails to respond to reasonable changes in the world market price, other means may benecessary to attain the second objective above, namely, to regulate the pace and violence of lasting changes and to mitigate the shock to producers who, throughcircumstances which they cannot control, find themselves losing their markets.Thus measures to stabilise prices may need on occasion to be supplemented by measures to smooth the transition to the new conditions and to regulateoutput meanwhile, so as to safeguard the standards of life of primary producers,as well as to ease the pains of change and progress. In the following plancarefully guarded proposals for restriction have, therefore, been added tothe less questionable proposals for stabilising prices with which it begins. It istrue that these run the risk of developing into chronic restriction of output. it remains to be seen, however, whether in the post-war world this will prove necessary over so wide a field as was thought necessary in the decade before thewar. We may reasonably hope that the adequate stimulation of demand and the raising of nutritional standards and the standard of life generally will havethe effect of taking up the slack and absorbing potential production. Certainlyit will be a matter for great dissatisfaction if we should find it advisabledeliberately to impoverish the world by checking a potential output of primaryfoodstuffs and other raw materials, whilst hundreds of millions of consumers goshort of what they should have.8. A complete scheme must endeavour to bring these two sets of arrange-ments, when both are required, into a consistent whole. In addition.&apos; aco-ordinating authority will be required to deal with difficulties arising betweenconflicting interests and to provide an adequate measure of conformity to acommon pattern.9. Superimposed on the fortuitous short-period price swings affectingparticular commodities and particular groups of producers there is thefundamental malady of the Trade Cycle.   Fortunately, the same technique of
Buffer Stocks, which has to be called into being to deal with the former, is alsocapable of making a large contribution to the cure of the Trade Cycle itself. &apos; Forthe maintenance of good employment throughout the world, in industrial countries as well as in those producing primary commodities, this is of the first importance,sufficient by itself to justify the setting up of machinery for Buffer Stocks. this aspect of the argument is further developed in Appendix II.II.The Outline of the Plan.10. The General Council.(i) A General Council for Commodity Controls shall be established, which each of the United Nations shall be invited to join as member States. other states may be invited to join either at the outset or subsequently. A State maywithdraw after adequate notice, say, two years.(ii) Member States shall not be parties, and shall not allow their nationalsto be parties, to any scheme or cartel in respect of a primary product which provides for export quotas or price schedules, organised by or on behalf of the exporters of more than one country, or for an international holding pool, unlesswithin two years of the establishment of the General Council it has beensubmitted to the CounciEs General Executive (see below) and has received itsapproval.(iii) Member States shall agree to accept decisions in respect of their exportquotas in the event of the establishment of regulation under g 12 (vii) or \ 14below.(iv) Each participating State shall be entitled to nominate a member on theGeneral Council, which shall meet annually to appoint (say) twelve members of aGeneral Executive and to receive and discuss a report from this Executive. the voting power of each member State on the General Council might be proportionalto its interest in international trade (and might be the same as in the case ofthe Clearing Union), and elections shall be made on the principles of proportional representation (so that a country or group of countries which possesses one-twelfthof the voting power will be able, in effect, to concentrate this voting powrer on onecandidate and thus make sure of electing him).(v) The General Executive shall appoint an independent Chairman, Vice-Chairman and General Secretary from outside their own number, who shall alsoact in these capacities at meetings of the General Council. All members of theExecutive shall have the same voting power.(vi) The General Executive shall be responsible for defining &quot; a primaryproduct&quot; for the purpose of the scheme, for delimiting the scope of theparticular controls and for co-ordinating their policies. The definition of a&quot; commodity &quot; and the range of produce to be handled by a single Control shallbe determined by the Executive, having regard to the variety of types and gradesand to the possibilities of substitution between one article and another. It is not intended, for the present at an)&apos; rate, that the scheme should cover coal or oil.11. The commoditites Controls.(i) Any group of countries interested either as exporters or importers of anyprimary product or groups of allied primary products (which we may convenientlycall commoditites) may submit proposals to the Executive to set up a commoditites Controlproviding for any of the following : price control, buffer stocks, export quotas, the regulation of output, the encouragement of new sources of supply, the main-tenance of reserve capacity. The Executive may invite any other countries, which appear to them to be substantially interested in commoditites, to join in the discussionof the proposals.(ii) An approved commoditites Control would consist of such number of member as is necessary to cover conveniently the countries principally interested,appointed, subject to the necessary exceptions, as follows : four-tenths by the exporting countries (electing by proportional representation on tihe basis of their exports in the five preceding years*), three-tenths by the importing countries(electing in the same manner on the basis of their imports) and three-tenths,being independent members, by the General Council. Decisions would be taken on the basis of a simple majority vote.(iii) A commoditites Control which provides for Buffer Stocks would be expected in general to conform to the principles laid down in $ 12 below.* This may need some appropriate adjustment at the initial post-war elections.
(iv) A commoditites Control which provided for a continuing regulation of outputor of export by means of quotas or in any other way would be expected in general to conform to the principles laid down in $ 14 below.(v) Nevertheless, variant schemes, departing in greater or less degree fromthese general principles, may be approved by the Executive on the recommenda-tion of a commoditites Control, if they are persuaded that special reasons make this,advisable.(vi) Where different commodities are capable of being substituted for one another, either by consumers or by producers, it shall be the duty of the GeneralExecutive to see that the particular commoditites Controls concerned act in line with one another, and it may require from them joint or correlated action, especially in price policy though the constitution of the commoditites Controls and the repre-sentation of the Executive on them should be calculated to ensure this withoutexpress instructions from the General Executive.(vii) More generally, it should be the function of the General Executive toreceive periodic reports of their operations from each of the Conunod Controls,to review their condition, and, if necessary, to make recommendations as to thepolicy which they should follow. Such recommendations would have as their object the protection of the general interest, and especially the maintenance of a stable level of general prices and the control of the trade cycle.(viii) (a) A commoditites Control would be concerned with that part of outputwdiich is available for export. It is not proposed that either individual Controlsor the General Kxecutive should have any authority over the prices paid to producers or charged to consumers in respect of domestic output consumed athome, although they may make representations to the Governments concerned as provided in ^ 14 (iv) below. Nor are they given any powers, beyond the right tomake representations under ^ 14 (iv), in respect of tariffs or subsidies whichare part of the national policy of any member State. For &quot;whatever successmay attend on efforts to raise nutritional and other standards, there mustnecessarily remain, at least for a long time ahead, a, wide difference between (lielevels attainable in poorer and wealthier countries. It is necessary, therefore,that regulation schemes should be framed on lines which leave each country free to give subsidies, direct or indirect, to its own producers, in order to maintain their standard of living at the level which it considers proper.(&amp;) None the less, a serious difficulty arises if such subsidies are given on asubstantial scale, especially if they are allowed to operate as export subsidies.For the effect of the subsidies is to maintain a larger volume of production in thecountries giving them, and also, if the method of tariffs is employed, to restrictconsumption, thus checking the redistribution of world demand in favour of themost economic producers. The network of governmental controls established inthis way and responsive to no economic stimulus was in some cases one of themain reasons for the accumulation of surpluses. The effectiveness of any bufferstock scheme must, therefore, partly depend on the possibility of eliminating,pre-war restrictions and securing general co-operation on the part of all Govern-ments in policies directed to the expansion of consumption. Thus it is important to secure a general understanding that subsidies (direct or indirect) given by governments to their own producers of those commodities which are the subjectof control schemes, should be confined within moderate limits and limited toproduce which is consumed, as well as produced, at home.(ix) commoditites   Controls  would  set   their   faces   against  any   deliberate -destruction of food which otherwise might take place locally whether or notincidentally   to   measures   of   regulation   described   below;    and   whereverappropriate they would make arrangements for unavoidable surpluses to be distributed for consumption in necessitous areas.12. Buffer Stocks.(i) A commoditites Control may, with the approval of the General Executive,establish a Buffer Stock accompanied by provisions to stabilise prices within acertain range. .(ii) In this case the Control would establish an initial basic price on a uniform c.i.f. basis, and would offer to buy commoditites at a price (say) 10 per cent,below the basic price and to sell it at a price (say) 10 per cent, above the basic price. The Buffer Stock should be prepared, save as hereinafter provided in$ 12 (ix) and $ 14 (vii), to take any supplies offered to it at the lower limit.The basic price would be modified by the Control from time to -time thereafterby a process of trial and error with a view to keeping the size of the Buffer Stockwithin a defined range.   If its own stock or world stocks were increasing beyond
a stipulated figure, or at more than a stipulated rate, thus indicating that theprice was unduly attractive to producers or unduly discouraging to consumers,the basic price would be reduced. Similarly, it would be raised if stocks werefalling below a convenient level or at too fast a rate. For this purpose the control would review the position, not only of its stocks, but also of total visible stocksthroughout the world, and also the prospective supply. The Control could notview with equanimity a situation in which outside stocks were accumulatingrapidly, even though its own were not. In other words, the object of the control would be to discover by empirical methods a range of prices within which supplyand demand would be in equilibrium when the influence of excessive short-periodfluctuations on either side of the market had been smoothed away.(iii) The basic price does not mean a single price, but a complex of prices,according to varieties of quality, of dates in relation to the crop year in thecase of agricultural commodities, and to position relatively to the cost of .transport to the ultimate consume]&apos;. It should not be technically difficult to fix the prices for the main categories of any commodity in proper relation to the basic price, provided discretion is allowed for variations in the differentialsbetween grades; for such margins are already established by trade practice.(iv) If the commoditites Control cannot agree an initial basic price acceptableboth to a majority of the exporters and to the majority of the importers, this price shall be fixed by the General Executive at the level which, in their judgment,is calculated gradually to bring about a proper relation between supply and demand without regulation of output, provided that this price is not below &quot; areasonable international economic price &quot; in the sense of $ 14 (vi) below.(v) If, either initially or later, it appears that unrestricted supply can onlybe absorbed at a price which falls below a &quot; reasonable economic price,&quot; theprocedure of ^ 14 shall be brought into operation, since the presumption will bethat the price mechanism by itself is inadequate to establish a tolerable position.(vi) The normal size of the Buffer Stock and its range of fluctuation wouldbe fixed by the General Executive on the recommendation of the commoditites control on the following general principles :  (a) It should be larger for commodities subject to the fluctuations of theseasons or where experience shows that either supply or demand isparticularly subject to sharp fluctuation or insensitive to price changes. Thus in the case of annual crops the normal stock should beat least large enough to replace any temporary deficiency caused by&apos;exceptionally poor harvests. In the case of other products, such as treecrops and minerals, where new production follows some years behind the initiation of measures to increase it, the stock should be reasonablysufficient against the possible gap where there is a pronouncedupward long-term trend in demand.(b) For some commodities the maximum number of months&apos; stock might haveto be kept below the usual figure because of the necessity to turn overthe stock and replace it frequently. In other cases, for example meat,the capacity and situation of refrigerated storage might be a limiting factor, unless canning or drying come to the rescue. For some tropicalor semi-tropical products storage is possible at some stages of pro-cessing but not at others. The technique and facilities for storagemay be expected to undergo continuing improvement, and the Controlscould very properly finance development in this direction.(c) Where there are physical reasons why the response of supply to the stimulus of increased prices is necessarily slow, it is important that the potential capacity should be in excess of normal requirements, andit may be advisable, therefore, to offer some inducement to provideor maintain such extra capacity. It would be the duty of an efficientControl to find ways of conserving and suitably rewarding a prudentmargin of excess potential capacity, charging the cost of this to consumers as a whole.(vii) The range between the Controls buying and selling prices, suggested above for purposes of illustration at 10 per cent, on either side of the basic price,need not be the same for every commodity and could be varied from time to time(and perhaps narrowed) in the light of experience. It might be found advisable to allow a wider range for some agricultural prices than for commodities not subject to the seasons. A study of the percentage deviations of crop yields fromtrend level in pre-war years suggests, however, that, even in the case of annualcrops, a price range of 20 per cent, will normally be sufficient to allow a fair
measure of stabilisatiou of producers&apos; incomes for the world as a whole. It willnot always effect this purpose within each separate country. But to do so lies jessentially outside the scope of an internationaf scheme, since it cannot be brought;about consistently with a uniform international price. There is nothing to preventindividual Governments from operating within the international scheme, if they wish to do so, with a view to a further stabilisation of the incomes of their ownproducers.(viii) When a revision of prices, either upward or downward, becomes necessary, the Control would aim at making such changes as small and gradualas possible. It would not be wise to lay down a hard-and-fast rule as to themaximum rate of such changes in advance of experience. It must partly dependon the stability of world conditions in other respects. The immediately previousmovement of prices within the range above or below the existing basic price wouldalso be relevant. But it is to be hoped that doionward revisions, at any rate, wouldnot normally exceed 10 per cent, within a year, and very gradual changes suchas 2 per cent, would be a mark of successful management. Nevertheless, theControl should be free to alter its basic price at any time, and there should beno absolute limitations on its discretion in determining the amount of the change,save that during a world depression, defined by suitable indices approved by theGeneral Executive, it would not be permitted to reduce the basic price by morethan 5 per cent, in one year.(ix) Since it is of the essence of the scheme that price changes should beas moderate and as gradual as possible, it is necessary to provide the Controlwith some means to prevent the Buffer Stock from being quickly overwhelmedwith offers if the effect of price changes works too slowly to give it the necessaryprotection. To facilitate this each exporting country shall have attributed to ita standard tonnage, to be fixed at the inception by agreement amongst exporters(or. failing this, by the General Executive) and subsequently equal to a movingaverage of its annual volume of net exports in the previous three or five years,,subject to appeal to the General Executive by any exporter for revision onexceptional grounds. On the occasion of a reduction in price, designed to offsetan excessive increase in the Buffer Stock, the Control shall be entitled at itsdiscretion to fix a quota of the standard tonnages (the same proportion of itsstandard tonnage for each exporting country), in excess of which no country shallexport to any destination; and to limit its takings from an exporter to an amount(including his sales in the market) not exceeding his quota. So long as suchquotas continue in force, the basic price shall be progressively reduced at a rateof not less than (say) 5 per cent, per annum provided (as before) that this doesnot bring the price below &quot; a reasonable economic level,&quot; in which case theprocedure of section 14 shall be invoked.(x) On the occasion of an increase in price, designed to offset a persistenttendency towards exhaustion of stocks in the hands of the Control, the Controlshall, if it thinks advisable and the General Executive approve, attempt toorganise and assist an expansion of additional capacity in the exporting countriesmost suitable for the purpose, either by reason of their being actual or potentiallow-cost producers or because they are deficit countries (or tending that way) inthe books of the Clearing Union, or for reasons of a social and humanitariancharacter. The obligation of the Control to sell on the usual terms in relationto its basic price wroulcl. of course, cease with the exhaustion of its stocks. Intime of scarcity, when such a situation was impending, some plan of allocatingsales to importing countries might be required.(xi) Some provision might be necessary to limit the Controfs liability to besaddled with responsibility for holding stocks destined for domestic consumption in the country of origin. Thus deliveries at the producing centres should beaccepted only at the Controks discretion and re-sales should not be made, unlessthe Control chooses, except on c.i.f. terms appropriate to some consuming centre.It has to be remembered, however, that a fluctuating part of domestic productionenters into international trade, for which the Control would have to allow andwhich it should facilitate.(xii) A Buffer Stock would not be applicable to highly perishable commodities could only be undertaken in cases where the produce can be stored for areasonable time. Even storable agricultural stocks would, however, require tobe turned over from time to time. and. noart from its contractual buying andselling obligations, the Control would itself deal in the market or arrange withmerchants so as to keen its shocks in motion where they might otherwisedeteriorate, replacing old stock bv new stool- without, however, modifying its total stock except as the result of its confranfor&apos; sales and purchaser   Tt might be
free to hold a modest proportion of its stocks in the shape of futures,appropriately related in price to spot transactions, and it should ease marketdifficulties by changing the position of its stocks. A consuming or entrepot centremight be allowed to attract stocks by offering to bear part of the cost of storage,provided it was not allowed, except by agreement, to bring within its jurisdictionan amount of total stocks out of proportion to its requirements for internalconsumption or entrepot trade. Generally speaking, the location of stocks shouldbe as widely distributed amongst consuming and producing centres as climate conditions for safe storage permit. But, in the case of &quot; key &quot; commodities, the commodity Controls might be required to take into account arrangements madefor the disarmament of the enemy powers.(xiii) Members would be expected to furnish the Control with full statistics of output, consumption and total stocks, including those held privately, and other information useful to producers and consumers, which the Control would publishat suitable intervals.(xiv) Within these reasonably wide limits, free and competitive internationalmarkets would handle the trade, as they would in the absence of control; andthere would be no objection to State trading by any country which preferred thatmethod subject to safeguards against its use for non-economic purposes. Theprotection against excessive price fluctuations provided by the control should allow merchants or State trading corporations to hold stocks and to operate with confidence within the determined&apos;range, and thus relieve the Controlof a multiplicity of detailed operations in day-to-day business. The operations of traders within this range might effect, in practice, a further narrowing of normal short-term fluctuations except where an abnormal surplus or deficiency of current supply was clearly in prospect.(xv) The profits arising out of the difference between the Controhs buyingand selling prices might be sufficient to pay for the costs of storage and manage-ment. If, however, they Avere inadequate for this purpose, a suitable levy shouldbe added to the price of all exports to meet the expense. Any net profits earnedby the Control should be employed to provide part of the fund for financing the stocks.(xvi) Special provisions would be required during the initial period afterthe Avar when most products are likely to be in short supply, Avhich the Controlsmust not aggravate by endeavouring to build up working stocks. Moreover, itwould be undesirable that they should fix basic prices under the influence of temporary conditions which might be considerably too high in normal circum-stances. On the other hand, the transitional period after the war, when suppliesof many primary products will inevitably remain under official control for thetime being, will offer a specially good opportunity for getting the Controlsorganised. The conclusion is that the Controls should be organised assoon as possible and before the period at AArhich they might be expected to enterinto active operation. In the initial stages they Avould be accumulating informa-tiori and statistics; and they should during this period endeavour to establish acommon doctrine between producers and consumers regarding reasonable basicprices for the commodities which they would control. At the same time they couldexamine the probable scale of prospectiA^e demand and the best means of distribute-ing and meeting it. The General ExecutiA7e would have a useful functionto perform at this stage in correlating ideas about the relative prices of the commodities concerned. If these preliminary measures Avere carried throughsuccessfully, the individual Controls would be able to intervene on the downsAvingat points which would receive general approbation, and so underpin the market and give confidence to producers, whilst postponing their liability to sell on this basis until sufficient stocks had accumulated in the ordinary course of events. Inany case, hoAvever, in Avhich surplus export stocks already existed in the handsof Governments, a Control should be prepared to take them over at an agreedprice, thus solving the problem of how to prevent the liquidation of such stocksfrom interfering with normal current output.The Finance of Buffer Stocks.13. We come next to the pivotal question of the finance of Buffer Stocks,for which large sums might be required if the system Avas extended to a number of commodities :  (i) It would be preferable that the whole of the finance required by theseveral Controls should be consolidated in the hands of the General ExecutiveAvho would be responsible for finding it, and that individual Controls should rely on&apos; the Executive and be subject to such limitations of finance as the Executivemay determine.
(ii) The necessary finance being thus consolidated, it might be obtained through an International Commodity loan issued in blocks as required, securedon the Buffer Stocks valued at their basic prices, supplemented by a general levy(as in g 12 (xv) above) on all the commodities covered by the schemes in the event ofthe aggregate value of the stocks as a whole falling below the net amount of the loans raised against them. Alternatively the capital of this International Loanmight be defined in terms of the value of the composite commodity made up of thevarious produce composing the stocks, so that its commodity value would beconserved irrespective of changes in the commodity-value of money. In either case such a loan would be exceptionally well secured. It must be rememberedthat a large part of the finance required is not new, but is already provided from private or public sources. At the initiation, therefore, of any Buffer StockScheme, countries already holding and financing either surplus or normal stocksof the commodity in question might be invited, especially if they are creditcountries in the books of the Clearing Union, to subscribe the sums thus released,or a part of them, to the Commodity Loan.(iii) There would be great advantages, on the other hand, if the fluctuatingmargin of the finance could be handled through the account of the GeneralExecutive with the Clearing Union on the assumption that this or some similarinstitution is set up. In this case the General Executive would hold an increasingcredit balance with the Clearing Union in times of general boom when the BufferStocks were running off, and an increasing debit balance in times of generalslump when the Buffer Stocks were accumulating. By this means a stabilisingfactor of major importance might be introduced into the world economic system.For purchasing power would be continuously withdrawn from the res! of the clearing Union system during the development of boom conditions and would,on the other hand, be continuously augmented during the onset of a slum]). Theimportance of Buffer Stocks as a measure contributory to the prevention of theTrade Cycle is developed in Appendix II below.(iv) It should be a condition of assistance from the general pool of financethat a commoditites Control, which was badly managed or failed to keep its financial obligations within the prescribed limits, could be taken over by the GeneralExecutive and. if necessary, wound up. Any resulting losses would be met, likeless avoidable losses, as provided in (ii) above, that is to say, by a general levy on the turnover of all the commodities covered by Buffer Stock arrangements.(v) No estimate can be framed of the total volume of the finance which wouldbe required, before it is decided how wide a range of the staple raw materials of international trade the schemes will endeavour to cover, or without enteringin detail in each particular case into the number of months&apos; stocks it would be advisable to hold, or in advance of experience of the proportion of total stocks which the Controls would, in practice, be required to carry. An attempt has,however, been made to compile figures (highly approximate), so as to indicate the order of the magnitude involved, for eight principal commodities wheat,maize, sugar, coffee, cotton, wool, rubber and tin which are given in appendix iii. These figures show that the total value of a year&apos;s international tradein these commodities, taking the average volume over the years 1935-38, was about 700 million at the prices of 1939 and  950 million at the prices of 1942. Ayear&apos;s stock on this basis in the hands of the Control would be much too high;three months&apos; would probably be too low at any rate, the Controls must beprepared to hold more than this; and some figure intermediate between theseextremes might be appropriate. A more comprehensive table taken from &quot; the network of World Trade &quot; (League of Nations), also given in Appendix III,indicates that stocks equal to six months&apos; exports of a wide range of primary products could be carried (at 1938 prices) with aggregate finance of (say) $m 2.500.It must be repeated that by no means the whole of the necessary finance isadditional to what would be required otherwise. Normal stocks must be held andmust sometimes accumulate to abnormal amounts, even in the absence of Controls,and the finance for carrying such stocks has to be found from somewhere. Forexample, it is estimated that the stocks of the above eight commodities (veryunequally distributed between them), including the domestic surpluses, likely tobe held at the end of 1942. outside Russia and the enemy-occupied countries, arelikely to be worth about  900 million at present prices, the finance for which isbeing found already.The Quota Regidation of Exports.14. A properly managed Buffer Stock scheme should prove effective instabilising the position of the many commodities for which it is appropriate
(see 12 (xii)), where there have been considerable price movements corresponding to changes of market trends, without any evidence of chronic maladjustment. Indrawing up the general regulations for such schemes it has, however, been necessary to recognise that cases will arise where the use of the price mechanism,aided only by Buffer Stocks, will be inadequate, because, if pressed to its logicalconclusion, it may result in bringing the price appropriate to the state of supplyand demand below a level which the producers can be expected to tolerate. If itis merely that the price mechanism works too slowly, the provision of I 12 (ix)above for the temporary quota-regulation of exports may be sufficient. But for anobstinate disequilibrium between supply and demand at a price level reasonablytolerable to producers, including a disequilibrium arising on a commodity whichcannot appropriately he covered by a buffer stock scheme at all, we may have to fall back on the organised restriction of production. The international regulationof exports may be the best means of ensuring this, but this would only be effectiveover a period, if it is supplemented by co-ordinated national schemes for the regulation of stocks and, where practicable, of production. Such schemes werecharacteristic of the decade before the war, and covered, with varying degrees ofeffectiveness, a wide range of commodities. Opinions differ as to how far thenecessity for these schemes was just one of many symptoms of the extremeeconomic malaise of that period and how far they are an inevitable accompani-ment of the wide differences of labour costs and of the opportunity fordiversification of output in different parts of the world. But there is likelyto be general agreement that such schemes may prove to be necessary inthe case of certain commodities even in the new circumstances; that any pro-posals for the international regulation of primary products must, therefore,provide for their possibility; and that careful precautions should be taken in handling an instrument which, if abused, is so liable to impoverish the world as awhole and waste its potential resources. For restriction schemes are a natural and indeed, an inevitable, sequel to the Buffer Stock proposals, in the event of the basic price necessary to secure equilibrium between supply and demand beingbelow .&quot; a reasonable international economic price.&quot; It is the interpretation ofthis last phrase which is the crux of all such schemes. This is not a difficultycreated by the present proposals. It is inherent in any form of restriction whichaims at a just balance between the claims of producers and of consumers. our plan cannot be expected to do more than provide an impartial and authoritativebody for its estimation, failing agreement between those chiefly concerned on thetwo sides of the world market. For the problem involves too many factorsincapable of precise measurement for its solution to be safely entrusted to a formula. A large element of common sense and of general judgment in the lightof all the known facts must be invoked in reaching a decision. The following isan attempt to combine effective regulation with adequate safeguards :  (i) If a majority of the exporting Governments represented on a CommodControl are agreed among themselves that the basic price appropriate to the pro-spective long-term state of supply and demand would be below a reasonable inter-national economic price, they shall be entitled to apply to the General Executive(see ^ 11 (ii) above, where a scheme of regulation already exists), which shall alsohear objections from consumers and minority producers, for permission to enforcequota regulation of exports, accompanied by control of stocks and, where prac-ticable, by regulation of production.(ii) In making this application the exporters shall state (a) whether the importing Governments represented on the Control supportor oppose the application and, in the latter event, the importingGovernments shall be entitled to explain the grounds of their objection;(b) whether their proposal is due to causes which they regard as likely to be continuing or whether it is strictly temporary to allow a gradualtransfer from high-cost to low-cost producers or from this particularproduct to an alternative product and, in the latter event, the measures proposed for bringing the restriction gradually to an end within astated period;(c) if, on the other hand, the proposal is due to causes regarded as likely to be continuing, how far, in their judgment, the existence of over--production is to be explained by (1) stimulation   of   exportable   capability   by   subsidies  or   their equivalent in some of the exporting countries,
(2) restriction of importing capacity by subsidisation of domestic pro-duction or by excessive prices to consumers through high tariffsor their equivalent in some of the importing countries,(3) uneconomic competition by substitutable commodities,(4) lack of opportunity on the part of some of the exporting countries to shift to alternative production more required by the world economy.(5) limitation of demand by the impoverished condition of potentialconsumers whose standards of living would benefit by increased consumption of the commodity;(d) what variations of economic cost exist between different producers andon different scales of total output;(e) the justification of the &quot; economic price &quot; they propose.(iii) On such an application being made, provisional export-quotas, basedon the procedure of   12 (ix) above, shall come into force immediately, pendingthe decision of the General Executive on future policy.(iv) Before approving a restriction scheme required for reasons regardedas likely to continue, the General Executive shall endeavour to deal with the radical causes of the problem. If reasons (I) and (2) have been adduced, they shall invite countries subsidising exports to reduce or abolish such subsidies,and countries applying tariffs or other expedients for fostering home produc-tion, to abate them.* If reasons (3) and (4) apply, they shall consult with theCommod Controls concerned with substitutable products or alternativeproduction, with a view to diminishing any uneconomic competition (if its existence is proved) and to encouraging alternative production, providing, ifnecessary, financial and technical assistance to promote a shift in production.If the case for (5) is made out, they shall consider whether it is practicable tofind some means of subsidising the consumption of the product in impoverishedcountries (in consultation as regards foodstuffs with a Nutritional Council, ii&apos;there is such a body).(v) If the exporters have not reached agreement amongst themselves as totheir standard tonnages for the purpose of the scheme, these shall be fixed bythe General Executive, which shall pay attention, amongst other considerations,to the proportionate share of the export trade on the average of the previousthree (or five) import years. In any case, when restriction is in force, theGeneral Executive shall be entitled to diminish the standard progressivelyof any country which subsidises exports, especially if this is not combined withcontrol of production: and to increase the standard of any country which is a deficit country in the Clearing Union or which is a relatively low-cost produceror which has special difficulties in producing alternative output.(vi) If the commoditites Control cannot agree a basic price under regulationacceptable both to a majority of the exporters and to a majority of the importers,this price shall be fixed by the General Executive at the level which, in their judgment, corresponds to &quot;a reasonable international economic price.&quot; in fixing this price, the Executive shall have primary regard to the level whichwTould provide the average (not marginal) producers of, say, two-thirds or three-quarters of the exporting countries, weighted according to their standardtonnages, with a standard of life in reasonable relation to the general standards of the country in which they live, and, where these standards have been low, shallerr in the generous direction with a view to their gradual improvement. Subjectto this, they shall aim at a level calculated&apos;gradually to bring supply into properrelation to demand without restriction; but, on the other hand, they shall also payattention, especially in the case of wasting assets such as metals, to provisions which may be expected to conserve potential capacity and to maintain and, ifnecessary, increase output in succeeding years to correspond to prospectivedemand. They shall aim at levels which are not excessively out of line with theprices of possible substitutes or are likely, for any other reason, to react adverselyon consumers&apos; demand. In general, they shall be influenced by a regard for thebest long-term interests of producers, provided no injustice or monopolyexaction is allowed against consumers.(vii) When the basic price under restriction has been fixed, there is noreason why the operations of the Buffer Stock should not continue as before but with this important difference. With free output the price was the variableelement by which the takings of the Buffer Stock were controlled.    With* In Appendix IV illustrations are given, for wheat and sugar, to show how much scopethere is for bettor international practice in these respects.
restricted output the range of price becomes fixed, and the quota of restrictionbecomes the element which the Buffer Stock Control must be free to vary. Inthis respect the plan would differ from most of those which have been operatedhitherto, where quota restriction, whilst it has aimed at securing an economicprice, has carried no guarantee of this price, so that, if demand falls below whatwas expected when the quota was fixed, the producer may suffer from restrictionwithout the compensation of a tolerable price. If a minimum basic price hasbeen fixed with the approval of the General Executive, the size of the quota canthen be handled empirically by the Buffer Stock Control, so as to keep the volumeof stocks within an appropriate range, whilst keeping the price within the usualrange of a fixed basic minimum.(viii) The duration of a restriction scheme shall not exceed 5 years in thefirst instance and, if it is renewed on the ground that there is still serious over-supply, the basic price for the next period of 5 years shall be reduced by theGeneral Executive unless special reason can be shown by the Control to the satisfaction of the General Executive, either on account of changes in otherprices or because a major factor causing the need for a continuation of restrictionis the high level of subsidy or protectionism in importing countries.(ix) The details of a regulation scheme not covered by the above, particularly the sanctions necessary to enforce it, shall be subject to the approval of theGeneral Executive.III.Conclusion.15. We do not disguise from ourselves that the constructive proposals setforth above are conceived in a spirit of hopefulness which may be disappointed.They assume a measure of international discipline and good-neighbourlinessand, in general, a readiness of Governments to accept proper standards of inter-national behaviour which did not exist before the war. They also depend on the effective substitution of an expansionist for a contractionist pressure on world demand through the better management of the supply of international money.Yet a better ordering of our affairs may not be so difficult as it looks if we tackleit boldly. The gluts which have disorganised production in the past have been small in relation to actual output and still smaller in relation, to potential demand,,and the disorder they have caused has been disproportionate to its origin. It-is not true that the impulse of individuals to toil and to produce exceedstheir readiness to enjoy and to consume, or that we have reached standards of lifeso high that our concern should be to hold back output and curb the bounty ofnature. It is, rather, the task of this generation to devise, by taking thought, an organisation which allows escape from an insane paradox by bringing productionand consumption into a fruitful union.4 Richmond-Terrace, S.W. 1,February 5, 1943.
The violence of individual price fluctuations and the inability of an unregulatedcompetitive system to avoid them.WIDE fluctuations in the prices of raw materials between general boom anddepression and between years of exceptional abundance and scarcity for particular commodities are well understood. But superimposed on those broad swings thereare disturbing short-term fluctuations on a surprising scale, which are apt to beconcealed from those who only watch the movements of index numbers and do notstudy individual commodities; since index numbers, partly by averaging andpartly by including many commodities which are not marketed in fully competitiveconditions, mask the short-period price fluctuations of the sensitive commodities.The results of an enquiry made in 1938 into the price fluctuations of rubber,wheat, lead and cotton will provide an illustration. This enquiry examined by what percentage the highest price in each of the last ten years exceeded the lowestprice in that year: Rubber. There was only one year in the decade before 1938 in whichthe high price of the year exceeded the low by less than 70 per cent. Theaverage, excess of the year&apos;s high over the years low was 96 per cent. Inother words, there was on the average some date in every year in which theprice of rubber was approximately double its price at some other date inthat year.Cotton. Since rubber may be regarded as a notoriously fluctuatingcommodity, in spite of its having been subject to an organised restrictionscheme, let us consider cotton. Only twice in those ten years did the high price of the year exceed the low by less than 33 per cent., and the averageexcess of the year&apos;s high over the years low was 42 per cent.Wheat, however, was nearly as fluctuating in price as rubber, which may-be a surprise. If we take the Liverpool contract as our standard, there wasonly one year in the decade when the highest price of the year exceeded the lowest by less than 47 per cent.; and the average excess of the year&apos;s highover the year&apos;s low was no less than 70 per cent.Lead is mainly marketed by a small number of powerful producers actingwith some measure of consultation. Yet, even so, the annual range of pricefluctuations was on much the same scale as with the commodities alreadyexamined. Only twice in the ten years was the price range from lowest tohighest less than 35 per cent., and the annual average was 61 per cent.Thus for these four commodities rubber, cotton, wheat and lead which arefairly representative of raw materials marketed in competitive conditions, theaverage annual price range over the decade before 1938 was 67 per cent, an orderly programme of output, either of the raw materials themselves or of theirmanufactured products, is scarcely possible in such conditions.There is a good theoretical explanation of this unfortunate state of affairs.It is an outstanding fault of the competitive system that there is no sufficientincentive to the individual enterprise to store surplus stocks of materials beyondthe normal reserves required to maintain continuity of output. The competitivesystem abhors the existence of buffer stocks, which might average periods of highand low demand, with as strong a reflex as nature abhors a vacuum, because suchstocks yield a negative return in terms of themselves. It is ready without remorseto tear the structure of output to pieces rather than admit them, and in the effort to rid itself of them; which should be no matter for surprise because the com-petitive system is in its ideal form the perfect mechanism for ensuring thequickest, but at the same time the most ruthless, adjustment of supply or demand to any change in conditions, however transitory. It is inherently opposed to security and stability, though, for the same reason, it has the great virtue ofbeing also opposed to stability in the sense of stagnation. If demand fluctuates,a divergence immediately ensues between the general interest in the holding of stocks and the course of action which is most advantageous for each competitiveproducer acting independently.There are several reasons for this. The cost of storage and! interest is fairlyhigh, especially in tihe case of surplus stocks which strain the capacity of thenormal accommodation. Reckoned ad valorem there is a wide range of storagecosts between different types of commodities, from (say) 5 to 25 per cent, perannum.   In the case of many commodities, however, the charges are probably in
the neighbourhood of 10 per cent, per annum ;&quot;* whilst the length of time forwhich holding will be necessary and the ultimate normal price are both mattersof great uncertainty. The costs of centralised storage schemes, especially ifinterest charges can be kept at a minimum, should be very much lower.There are, however, two other still more dominating factors. Experienceteaches those who are able and willing to run the speculative risk that, when themarket starts to move downward, it is safer and more profitable to await a furtherdecline. The primary producer is, as a rule, unable or unwilling to hold, so that,if the speculative purchaser holds back, he will get the commodity still cheaper.Thus, even if it would pay him to buy at the existing price on long-periodconsiderations, it will often pay him better to wait for a still lower price. Theother factor arises out of the lack of incentive to the retailer or the manufacturingconsumer to purchase in advance. By purchasing in excess of his immediateneeds he may make a speculative profit or loss just like any outside speculator,but as a trader or a manufacturer his position will be competitively satisfactorywhen the time comes to use the materials, provided he is paying the current price.Thus a cautious user would rather pay the current price for his raw materials onwhich his own selling prices are based than run a speculative risk; and this attitude is reinforced by the fact that his interests are already bound up withactivity in the demand for the commodity in question, so that he is multiplyingunnecessarily the same kind of risk if he buys his material in advance of hisneeds. On the other hand, the long-term holding power of the outside speculatoris limited most participants in the market being more interested in a rapidturnover and can only be called into action on a sufficient scale by a drastic fallin prices which will curtail current output substantially and appears to be along way below any probable normal cost of future production. This adjustment of prices has to be all the more violent because, for a variety of technical and social reasons, both the consumption and the production of primary products have become increasingly insensitive to changes in their prices; and it is all the moredisastrous because the tendency of international trade is to make many countriesincreasingly dependent on individual crops, for wdiich they are specially suited,so that the social consequences of large movements in the prices of these specialisedproducts are severe and the dangers of instability are enhanced.The violent price fluctuations, which we have learnt to accept as normal,besides their adverse effect on trade stability, also impose obstacles to the holding of an adequate quantity of stocks, the eventual effects of which are not lessinjurious. For, although the difficulty of rapidly altering the scale of output,especially of agricultural crops, leads to what appear to be large stocks at the bottom of the market, nevertheless, when the turn of the tide comes, stocks turnout to be insufficient for the reason that it is just as difficult rapidly to increasethe scale of delivered output as it had been to diminish it. Prices rush up,uneconomic and excessive output is stimulated and the seeds are sown of a subsequent collapse.While the sufferings of primary producers resulting from this instability are by now generally appreciated, it is not so fully recognised that violent fluctuationson world markets are to an important, though less, extent transmitted rightthrough to the consumer. Statistical investigation of the degree to which this istrue is practicable only on a limited scale since there are relatively few productshaving the required simplicity of raw-material content. Perhaps the best examplefor the purpose is bread; and it has been found that, over the decade to 1938, the retail price of the loaf in this country fluctuated almost as widely, though ofcourse not so frequently, as the cost of the equivalent amount of wheat on theworld market. Butter and cheese are more suitable than most things for similarinvestigation and here, too, the same conclusion holds good in only slightly less degree. Many of the more elementary foodstuffs, admittedly, are by reason ofperishability non-susceptible to treatment by a scheme involving the maintenanceof buffer stocks; but even these would acquire some secondary stability fromgreater steadiness in the cost of animal feeding-stuffs. So far as the plan helped,directly or indirectly, to keep the consumer-cost of staple foods on an even course it would diminish the force of a powerful element in public unrest and simplify the processes of wage negotiation and social policy generally.(*) Mr. Benjamin Graham in his book on Storage and Stability (p. 108) estimates the overagecommercial cost to dealers in the commodity exchanges of storing 23 standard raw materials afc13  per cent, of their value per annum, exclusive of interest, whilst he considers that organisedGovernment storage could be provided at a quarter of this cost His estimate of the commer-cial cost is considerably higher than the above, which is intended to include interest, but hisaverage is considerably affected by the exceptionally high ad valorem cost of storing maize,oats and petroleum.[248401
Buffer Stocks as a Measure Contributory to the Prevention of theTrade Cycle.AT present a falling off in effective demand-in the industrial consumingcentres causes a price collapse, which means a corresponding break in the level of incomes and of effective demand in the raw material producing centres, with afurther adverse reaction, by repercussion, on effective demand in the industrial centres; and so, in the familiar way, the slump proceeds from bad to worse.And when the recovery comes, the rebound to excessive demand, through the stimulus of inflated prices, promotes, in the same evil manner, the excesses of theboom. But if the Commodity Controls are in a position to take up at stableprices the slack caused by the initial falling off in consuming demand, and thus to preserve some measure of stability of incomes in the producing centres, thevicious cycle may be inhibited at the start; and again, by releasing stocks whenconsumption recovers, the Commodity Controls can prevent the inflation of rawmaterial prices which carries the seeds of an incipient boom.The very fact that in the aggregate large sums of money may be involvedin such storage schemes, though it aggravates the technical and financial problems,is of positive assistance when we come to the handling of the Trade Cycle. for we have at our disposal a weapon capable of producing large effects by rapidaction, and of operating in the negative as well as in the positive direction, sothat it can function as a stabilising factor both ways. By taking up or byreleasing stocks, the complex of Commodity Controls can operate in both directions on a scale and with an immediacy which is quite impossible for projects of public works. Organised public works, at home and abroad, may be the rightcure for a chronic tendency to deficiency of effective demand. But they are notcapable of sufficiently rapid organisation (and, above all, they cannot be reversedor undone at a later date) to be the most serviceable instrument for the preven-tion of the Trade Cycle. Buffer Stock Controls to deal with the epidemic ofintermittent effective demand are therefore the perfect complement of Develop-ment Organisations (or International T.V.A.) to offset a deficiency of effectivedemand which seems to be endemic.Closely associated with this advantage is another one of scarcely less importance, namely, that by this means the raw material stocks of a producingcountry are rendered, always liquid. A producing country is always paid for itsoutput at or above a reasonable minimum price, whether or not the whole of thisoutput passes immediately into consumption, and paid for it in liquid cash, whichit can employ on maintaining its normal volume of imports and its normalstandard of life, thus retaining its own stability and being no longer the occasion,by repercussion, of instability in others. There can be no question that thescheme proposed would be of the very greatest value to raw material countries,especially to those which are financially weak, with overseas debt and lacking inreserves or are highly specialised in their produce.

Liverpoolwas about 5s. per cwt.; the import duties in force were : in France 10s. Id. percwt.; in Italy 12s. 4cZ.; in Germany 18s. 11^.; even in countries like Czecho-slovakia and Austria, the duty was over 5s. per cwt.; and the internal price inFrance was 15s. Qd. per cwt., and in Italy and Germany about 14s., or about three times the world market price. The maintenance of this high internal pricetended to restrict consumption, but stimulated production, until these countries were self-supporting and, in the case of France, developed an export trade inwheat. The world market was correspondingly contracted and the open market price fell to levels unremunerative to any producer.The case of sugar is even more striking. The open market price c.i.f. UnitedKingdom, ex duty, averaged 4s. 8d. per cwt. during the three years 1934-36.Java, Peru and other economic producers, dependent largely on the world market, could just afford to maintain production at this price, but their pro-duction had to be severely restricted and the markets open to them were constantly declining, till they supplied less than 20 per cent, of the world con-sumption. Sugar was grown in other countries under every variety of protection and preference at all sorts of higher prices. The United States grew a quota ofbeet sugar at home and gave a protected market to the Philippines and a preferential market for a quota of Cuban sugar. The United Kingdom grew a quota of beet sugar at home and gave a preferential market to Empire sugar at
much above the world price.* Australia sold her cane sugar production at homeat 23s. to 24s. a cwt. and exported a substantial quantity to the United kingdom at the Empire price. But it was the subsidised production of beet sugar, above all, which disorganised the market. Out of a total world production of about28 million tons, over 10 million tons represented the amount of beet sugar,produced in almost every case on the basis of a protected price much above the open market price. Moreover, the European beet sugar industries produced notonly sufficient for home requirements, but also considerable quantities for export.The retail price in most European countries was not determined by the open market price, but was fixed so as to cover the costs of domestic production plus the loss on exports, on top of which was often added heavy taxation for revenuepurposes; and total consumption in the different countries varied inversely withthe retail price, e.cj.:-Consumption per head (in kilog. Retail priceper annum). (pence per kilog.).1935-36. 1935-36.Denmark.........                55-9 4-6Sweden     .........                48-8 4-5Great Britain     ......                47-8 5-0Finland    .........                29-7 6-9Norway    .........                31-9 7-france     ...      .--       ---                25-1 7-6Germany.........                23-4 15-0Hungary.........                 10-55 11-4Italy        .........                 7-9 15-if tariffs and taxes were limited retail prices could be reduced and con-sumption would expand. Unless the reduction of tariffs was considerable thiswould not directly help the economic producers, as they would still be unableto compete with the protected home industry, but indirectly it would do so asthe additional outlet on the home market would tend to decrease subsidisedexports and thus increase outlets for economic production on the world market.Without some such increase of home consumption in the beet sugar countries or some reduction of their subsidised export, the outlet on the world market for economic producers shrinks continually and the clumping of subsidised sugardepresses world prices to levels which are unprofitable, even to economic pro-ducers. None of the subsidising countries is likely to accept the simpleabandonment of their assisted production. The best that can be hoped for isthat they will limit it to some agreed production quota on condition that total supplies are kept in reasonable relation to effective demand. The situation would be still further improved if general agreement could be reached that any assistance given to domestic producers should be financed by the budget and not passed on to consumers by means of import tariffs or controls, as in that case theconsumer would get the benefit of world prices and consumption would expand.(*) In 1937-38, the United Kingdom sugar supplies were obtained as follows : Price per Ciot.Tons. s.   d.Foreign      ......e     509,000 5   other Empire ... 824,000 . 9 2Colonial certified   ...       357,000 10   2Home-grown beet ...       418,000 18 10   (excluding  assistance given  to beetsugar industry which represented io.1936-37 5s. 3d. a cwt.)
