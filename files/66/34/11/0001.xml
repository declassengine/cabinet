naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   A convoy from North Russia has arrived in the United Kingdom.A convoy has reached Malta from Port Said.Two U-boats have been sunk. Several others were probably damaged by aircraft. ...An Atlantic convoy has been heavily attacked by U-boats, and convoys in theMediterranean have suffered casualties from U-boats, aircraft and mines. Inconsequence, shipping losses have been heavier than of late.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. A convoy of ten ships from North Russia arrived in the UnitedKingdom on the 9th.   One ship was lost.HALS. Londonderry (sloop), damaged by premature depth charge explo-sion in mid-Atlantic last week, reached harbour on the 6th.The US. Submarine Shad torpedoed the German s.s. Nordfels (1,214 tons)off Bilbao on 25th January, but the ship reached harbour.Mediterranean.3.   Two ships of the first convoy to Tripoli entered harbour on the 4th.H.M.C.S. Louisberg (corvette), escorting an eastbound convoy, was sunk by aircraft on the 6th during an attack by enemy bombers and torpedo-bombersnorth-east of Or an.   Three officers and 47 ratings were rescued.H.M.S. Erica (corvette) was sunk, probably by U-boat, north-east of Benghazion the 9th.   All the officers and 71 ratings were saved.An escorted convoy of six ships reached Malta on the 10th.4.   HAL Submarines have reported the following attacks :  Tigris sank a 4,000-ton ship off Brindisi on the 2nd.Safari (P. 211). north of Sicily, shelled and sank two schooners, one full ofammunition, on 30th January. On 2nd February she sank a 2,500-ton ship bytorpedo, and later shelled and sank another ship of 700 tons.Pacific.5. Twenty Japanese destroyers were sighted and attacked by aircraft N.W.of Vella Lavella (Solomons) on the 4th.   One was sunk and two damaged.On the 5th an enemy force of four battleships, six heavy cruisers and two aircrafts carriers was sighted 400 miles S.E. of Truk on a southerly course.Nineteen Japanese destroyers on a south-easterly course north-west ofGuadalcanal, on the 7th, were attacked by aircraft.   Two were damaged.It was estimated on the 3rd that about 167,000 tons of Japanese shippingwas in the vicinity of Rabaul.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. H.M.S. Vimy (destroyer), while escorting a homeward-bound atlantic convoy, sank U-boat 187 in mid-Atlantic on the 4th. Thirty-four prisoners were taken.H.M.C.S. Regina (corvette) when escorting stragglers from a Mediterraneanconvoy off Philippeville captured an Italian U-boat and 27 prisoners on the 8th.The U-boat later sank in tow.Thirty-eight other attacks have been reported as carried) out during the week.These do not include an unknown number made by the escorts of a homeward-bound convoy. Of the total, 30 were by aircraft and eight by surface craft. Oneof the aii&apos; attacks, in the Western Mediterranean, is considered promising and six others may have caused damage.Enemy Intelligence.German.7.   It is believed that Hipper and koln have left Trondheim.Reconnaissance of Gdynia on the 5th showed Scharnhorst and Emdenpresent.
9 Q/ italian.8. The 8&quot; cruiser Bolzano, which was torpedoed on the 8th November, isnow at Spezia and is expected to complete by the end of the month.Fewer but larger ships have been employed between Italy and Tunisia duringthe past week.U-boats.9. It is believed that 110 U-boats operated in the Atlantic during the week.Concentration continued in the North, particularly south of Iceland (C), whereone pack may have totalled as many as 20 U-boats.Elsewhere activity was evident near Madeira, the Canaries and in theWestern Mediterranean, where about eight German U-boats are believed to be operating. Other German as well as Italian U-boats are believed to be in theEastern Mediterranean.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending 7th/8th, 772 ships were convoyed. Of these168 were in ocean convoys and 604 in British coastal convoys. One Braziliancruiser, 53 destroyers (including seven U.S. destroyers), and 73 sloops, cuttersand corvettes (including three U.S. cutters), were employed, on escort duties.During the week 107 ships, in four ocean convoys, arrived in home waters without loss.11. During the month of January 245 ships, in 10 ocean convoys, arrived in the United Kingdom or Iceland (C) without loss; and two homewrard bound convoys, consisting of 52 ships, lost two ships. Eleven outward ocean convoys of229 ships arrived at their destination without loss; and three outward convoysof 87 ships lost 14 and one straggler by enemy action.12. Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending 6th totalled 546,000 tons compared with 318,000 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 458,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Of the week&apos;imports 236,000 tons were mineral oils of various grades.Enemy Attack on Shipping.13. During the. week U-boats are reported, to have attacked 16 ships, ofwhich 11 are believed to have been sunk. In repeated attacks by a concentration of U-boats on a homeward-bound Atlantic convoy, nine ships were torpedoed andof these six are believed to have sunk.One ship in local convoy was sunk by U-boat south of Jervis Bay and another was sunk east of Sydney (New South Wales). An independently routed ship was torpedoed off Port Elizabeth (South Africa).In the Mediterranean an east-bound convoy was attacked by U-boats and aircraft off Algiers, two ships being sunk and another torpedoed. One ship was sunk and another torpedoed in a convoy from Alexandria to Benghazi. three ships in a west-bound convoy were mined and sunk in the western approaches to gibraltar.   A Spanish ship was mined west of Gibraltar.14. During January 221.000 tons of shipping was lost by enemy action;less than the lowest monthly total for 1942. U-boats accounted for 81 per cent.;aircraft, 10 per cent.; mines, 7 per cent., and other causes, 2 per cent.The bulk of the losses occurred in the North Atlantic and was caused by -boats, those by aircraft were in the Mediterranean, chiefly in N. African ports and approaches.Eleven tankers were sunk during the month. Seven of these were in oneconvoy to Gibraltar.British Minelaying.15. Surface craft laid mines in the Straits of Dover and aircraft in the bay of Biscay, off the Frisian Islands and in the Baltic.In the Mediterranean mines were laid by surface craft and by aircraft offthe coasts of Tunisia and Sicily.[25034] B
Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.16. Minelaying by enemy aircraft oil&apos; the East. South-East and South coastswas suspected on three nights of the week.E-boats were also suspected of laying mines off Yarmouth.During January 17 mines were washed ashore in the English Channel.In the Mediterranean the approaches to Philippeville have been declareddangerous clue to enemy moored mines, and 19 mines have been destroyed duringthe week off Tripoli.The mine totals, including those in foreign waters, are 4,152 ground and2,187 moored.French Merchant Shipping.17. Five ships totalling 35,744 tons arrived in the United Kingdom from north Africa.   Four other ships are expected shortly.Swedish Iron Ore Exports in 1942.18. Iron ore exports from Sweden to Axis countries in Europe inDecember 1942 amounted to 737.000 tons, of which 102.000 tons were despatchedvia Narvik; exports in the previous December totalled 574,000 tons, of which24,000 tons were from Narvik. The complete picture for the year 1942 comparedwith 1941 is as follows : Total Ex-portsExports from    Exports from       to enemySwedish ports.       Narvik. Europe.1941      ......      8,812.000 738.000 9.550,0001942      ......      7,467.000 1,158,000        ..8,625,000Total exports from Sweden in 1942 thus show a drop of 925,000 tons compared with 1941.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)The Russo-German Campaign.Kursk Sector.19. Advancing in a westerly direction on a broad front astride the railway from Voronezh, the Russians have captured Kursk, the base from which theGermans prepared their summer offensive of 1942. Further south they have captured the important railway station and town of Bielgorod.South-east of Kursk the Russians have also taken Staiw Oskol, thus clearing the lateral railway Yelets-Valuiki.Donetz Sector.20. The Russians have resumed their advance westwards and south-westwards from the railway Valuiki-Starobjelsk, and have thrown the Germansback towards Kharkov and the general line of the Upper Donetz.In the Balakleya-Lisichansk area, on the Middle Donetz, the Russians have crossed the river in force and thus threaten the whole German system of communications from the Ukraine to the Donetz bend. The Germans, however,are fighting hard here, and it appears as though they may have meant to hold the Donetz as a main defence line.Rostov and Caucasus Sectors.21. Such German forces as had been retiring north-westward astride therailway Baku-Rostov have completed their withdrawal, and the Germans are seeking to hold two bridgehead positions : (a) The first, covering Rostov and the Don Delta.(b) The second, containing the bulk of their forces, east of the TamanPeninsula.The bridgehead covering Rostov has been subjected to heavy Russian attacksboth from the east and the south and the Russians now appear to be fighting inthe southern outskirts of Rostov itself.
The Taman bridgehead covers the general area Achtary-Krasnodar-Novorossisk. Some positions which might have formed part of this bridgeheadhave already been seized, and fighting continues.Russian landings have been made in the Movorossisk area, and though theGermans claim to have destroyed the first landing parties, the final outcome ofthese operations is still to be awaited.Summary.22. By breaching the line of the Middle Donetz, the Russians nowthreaten the rear of the German position at Rostov and in the Donetz bend.A further straightening of the German front seems imperative, and a with-drawal might well be made to the line held in the south last winter namely,Kharkov-Taganrog, but even this line has now been reached by the russians in places. In this respect the fall of Kursk is particularly significant, for thecity had been continually in German hands since November 1941, and its defencesshould, therefore, have been easily tenable. The Russians, however, have nowbeen fighting hard for three months, and future events must depend in part ontheir ability to continue the pressure, and to overcome the difficulties of weather and communications.Libya.23. During the ten days ending on the 9th the Eighth Army&apos;s contact with the enemy on land was limited to clashes between the patrols of ourleading armoured and infantry brigades, and the enemy&apos;s rearguard, about a brigade strong. The enemy appeared to be withdrawing his main forces to theMareth position, where it is likely that a stand will be made. On the 1st our forward patrols were along a general line Zuara-El Uotia-Giosc-Nalut, approxi-mately 30 miles east of the Tunisian frontier, though small detachments had penetrated considerably further west. By the 7th enemy detachments at Si Toui,Pisida and Remada had been withdrawn, and the line of our forward troops ranfrom a point midway between Ras Adjir and Pisida, thence 10 miles west of el Assa to a line 10 miles west of the Si Toui-B. Talarh track. On the 8th enemy resistance was confined to a pocket in the Taguelmit area, and 15 tanks fromBen Gardane were seen to move to this locality. On the 9th a further 14joined them. Ten miles east of Taguelmit our armoured forces secured a bridge-head across the marshes. During the morning of the 9th our armoured-car patrols were in contact with enemy armoured cars and anti-tank guns in several localitiesbetween Foum Tatahouine and Ksar Morra. The advance of our leading infantry brigade along the coastal road towards Rad Adjir has been delayed by demolitions,bad going, and the exposed nature of the ground.The maintenance problems of the Eighth Army have been eased by the partialreopening of the port of Tripoli on the 4th.Tunisia.24.   In the north, patrol activity by both sides has continued.In the Central Sector British forces on the 3rd attacked and capturedpositions on the high ground 13 miles south-west of Pont du Fahs. An enemycounter-attack on the same day failed and our forces were reinforced on the night of the 3rd/4th. A further enemy counter-attack the next day compelledour troops to withdraw to their original positions. During the engagement,which was of a purely local character, the enemy are estimated to have sustained300 casualties.Further south, in the area of the Ousseltia-Kairouan pass, the situation has remained unchanged. The French in this area have, however, reported consider-able enemy M.T. movement on the Kairouan-Karachoum and Kairouan-Ousseltia roads.In the Southern Sector, on the 2nd, U.S. forces put in a further attack against the enemy positions at Faid. This was unsuccessful and the engagementwas broken off. Besides holding the Faid pass itself, the enemy is in control ofthe high ground which commands the approaches south and southeast of Faid.The railway station at Sened, which passed into the hands of &quot;CJ.S. forces onthe 2nd, was evacuated by them on the night of the 3rd/4th and is now believed[25034] b 2
to be occupied by the enemy. On the 9th, a small enemy attack drove theFrench from a point eight miles south of Gafsa. Our forces counter-attacked andrestored the situation.Burma.A arakan.25. Continuing their attack on the 2nd, our troops in the Mayu Peninsulareduced an enemy strong point, one mile N.N.W. of Oonbaik (six miles north ofFoul Point). Later in the day they repulsed an enemy counter-attack. On the night of the 3rd/4th our troops again attacking strong points north of Donbaikwere anticipated by two heavy enemy counter-attacks, both of which were beatenoff with loss to the enemy. A further enemy attack on the 6th, and two attacks on the night of the 7th/8th, were repulsed with losses to the enemy. In theRathedaung Area Taunghlamaw was occupied with little opposition, butresistance rapidly became very determined and, although we have consolidatedour gains, further advances from Taunghlamaw have been held up. Japanesecasualties are reported to be heavy on this front.Pacific Zone.New Guinea.26. Allied troops continue to make progress against the Japanese in theWau area.Solomons.27.   It is now confirmed that the Japanese have evacuated Guadalcanal.Intelligence.France.28. In recent weeks a considerable number of German divisions have leftFrance and the Low Countries for Russia. Their departure has been partlycounter-balanced by the arrival of a smaller number of divisions in the west.There is evidence that two new divisions are forming in France. One of these,in the Chalons-sur-Marne area, is an S.S. division, and it is probable that theother, in the Angouleme area, is also S.S.The total number of divisions in France and the Low Countries is estimated to be 34.New Guinea and Solomons.29. Japanese losses during the campaign in Papua from the 21st July, 1942-the 2nd February, 1943, were 6,350 killed and 342 prisoners. These figures include medical as well as battle casualties. The Japanese admit the loss of16,700 killed or dead through sickness, during the Guadalcanal and Buna opera-tions.   This is not likely to be an overestimate.Japanese Army.30. It is considered that, owing to their losses on Guadalcanal, oneJapanese division has been annihilated. Tne strength of the Japanese army has, therefore, been reduced from 84 to 83 divisions. With the arrival offurther reinforcements in the South-West Pacific Area the following changes have occurred in the order of battle : Decrease in Manchuria from 24 to 23 divisions.Decrease in unlocated divisions from 10 to 8.Increase in Mandated Islands from 3 to 4.Increase (net) in the South-West Pacific Area from 3 to 4.AIR SITUATION.General Review.31.   Bomber Command aircraft made night attacks on Lorient and Turin.Successful attacks were made on enemy harbours and airfields in theMediterranean.
United Kingdom.32. A total of 54 enemy aircraft flew over this country by day and 13 by night. Others operated off our coasts, some of which were suspected of mine-laying. Six were destroyed and three were damaged by our fighters andA.A. guns.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.33.   Weather conditions were generally unfavourable for bombing raids.On the 4th, 86 U.S. heavy bombers were despatched to attack the railway centre at Hamm. Owing to cloud, it was not possible to identify the target,and 39 Fortresses (B. 17) bombed a town believed to be Emclen, dropping390 bombs of 500-lbs. each. Strong opposition was encountered from about60 enemy aircraft, of which 25 were destroyed, eight probably destroyed and six damaged; five Fortresses (B. 17) are missing. On the same day sevensquadrons of Spitfires carried out a sweep of the St. Omer-Ypres area, and destroyed or damaged three F.W. 190s.Caen railway centre was bombed by 11 Venturas (B. 24) on the 10th from about 9,000 feet and bursts were seen on an engine shed and on other parts ofthe target. Three of the Spitfire escort were shot down and three enemy fighters were damaged.Harassing attacks were made on enemy communications by aircraft of fighter and Army Go-operation Commands, and, on such days as weather conditions were favourable, very good results were obtained. At least 20 goodstrains were attacked and trucks were damaged or set on fire; 32 locomotives were destroyed or damaged, two escort vessels, an armed trawler, barges and an&quot; R &quot; boat were damaged and military Aphides and other targets were shot up.From these operations nine of our aircraft are missing.Night.34. Two large-scale attacks were made on Lorient by a total of 414 bombers;the second of these was the heaviest that has been made recently on this U-boatbase and a total of about 750 tons of bombs was dropped, as a result of which enemy defences were overwhelmed and silenced. The weather conditions were favourable on both nights, the. attacks were well concentrated and large areas ofthe town and docks were ablaze with one particularly large fire in the PortMilitaire, where thick black smoke rose to 10,000 feet; eight bombers are missing.On the night 4th/5th, a force of 188 bombers, two of which are missing,was despatched to Turin and completed a successful raid, delivering their attck in a space of about 40 minutes. The weather over France and the Alpswas cloudy, but cleared over the target. Flares and marker bombs were welltimed and placed by the Pathfinder force, resulting in a concentrated attackwith large fires which appeared to take a firm hold. Over 350 tons of bombs were dropped, including 3 x 8,000-lbs. and 28 x 4,000-lbs. On the same nightthree Lancasters bombed Spezia.Coastal Operations.35. Anti-U-boat patrols, by aircraft of Bomber and Coastal Commands,resulted in a number of sightings and some promising attacks. Four Ju. 88s were shot down in the Bay of Biscay; six of our aircraft are missing from U-boat and reconnaissance patrols.Bomber Command despatched 119 aircraft and Coastal Command fiveaircraft on sea-mining operations, and 220 mines were laid in enemy waters; sixaircraft are missing.Leaflet Operations.36. The total number of leaflets dropped, during the month of Januaryamounted to 20,196,437 as compared with 18,576,050 dropped in December.The number of packages dropped was 2,936 as against 3,139 in December. the leaflets were distributed, over Germany, France, Holland, Belgium, Norway and denmark.
Mediterranean.French North Africa.37.   Air operations were considerably hampered by bad weather.A heavy daylight attack was made on the docks and shipping at Sousse by42 escorted U.S. Fortresses (B. 17), which dropped 83 tons of bombs. Hits weremade on buildings and jetties and on at least two ships.Two attacks on Gabes airfield and one attack on an airfield five miles west ofGabes were made by escorted U.S. bombers, nearly 80 tons of bombs being dropped.Many bombs fell on the airfields and on concentrations of M.T.During the attacks on Sousse and the two airfields, 43 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat, 15 were probably destroyed and 14 were damaged. FiveU.S. bombers and five fighters are missing.Wellingtons dropped 14 tons of bombs on Bizerta, and U.S. Fortresses (B. 17)dropped 30 tons on Kairouan airfield.Successful attacks were carried out by fighter bombers on M.T. and A.A.positions in the Gafsa, Pont du Fahs, Sfax and Gabes areas, and on Houmt Souk(Djerba Island), where a schooner was destroyed.Our fighters flew numerous offensive patrols and reconnaissances and pro-vided protection for shipping.Enemy aircraft were active against shipping (vide Naval Situation) andineffectively attacked the airfields at Souk El Arba, Souk El Khemis and Bone.Tripolitania.38.   Adverse weather conditions restricted air operations over the forward area.Our fighter bombers attacked Pisida harbour and two schooners off the coast.They also bombed the airfield and town of Ben Gardane and M.T. and blockhouses in that area.Enemy aircraft bombed Tripoli and attacked our positions in the forward area.   Mines were laid off Tripoli harbour.Southern Italy, Sicily and Sardinia.39. Allied bombers from French North Africa and Libya carried out succesful raids on Naples, Palermo and Messina.Fifty tons of bombs were dropped in a daylight attack&quot; on Naples. three ships were hit and fires were started on the moles. In three attacks on Palermo65 tons were dropped. Many fires were left burning in the town and in the harbour. In the attack on Messina, on which 27 tons were dropped, hits wei*eobtained on or near the train ferry terminus, on railway sidings and on harbourbuildings.Syracuse, Trapani and Enna (in Central Sicily) were also successfullybombed, and mines were laid in the entrance to Trapani harbour. Comiso airfield and railway targets in Southern Sicily were raided by fighter-bombers from Malta.U.S. bombers dropped 80 tons of bombs on the airfield at Elmas and the seaplane base at Cagliari (Sardinia). At Elmas. buildings wei^e hit and manyaircraft destroyed on the ground; at the seaplane base several fires were started.The airfield was also bombed by Wellingtons. Attacks were made on other targets in Sardinia, including the airfields at Villacidro and Decimomannu.Crete.40.

Bombers from Malta torpedoed and set on fire a 6,000-ton ship off thenorth coast of Sicily. U.S. Mitchells (B. 25) bombed four ships in the SicilianChannel; one ship was sunk and another was left sinking.Belated reports have been received of a hit by a Wellington on a 6,000-tontanker on the night of the 2nd/3rd; when last seem the ship was beached on theCalabrian coast.India and Burma.42. Blenheims with fighter escort, and Hurricanes carried out a numberof attacks on military targets in the area between Rathedaung and Akyab;buildings, villages, huts, M.T., gun-posts and small craft were bombed ormachine-gunned.
Further south in the Taungup area M.T. and buildings were destroyed, and raids were also made on Prome and the airfield at Magwe.Seven Wellingtons bombed the railway centre and station at Mandalay, and eight miles to the south U.S. Mitchells (B. 25) twice attacked and hit the railway bridge at Myitnge. Other attacks were concentrated on railway targets to thenorth-west, south-west and south of Mandalay; on one day at least eightlocomotives and other rolling stock were damaged; barges and river steamers were also attacked. Three raids by a total of 31 Liberators (B. 24) were made on therailway centre and docks at Rangoon.Few reports have been received of enemy activity. Two attacks were madeon our forward positions and a small raid was made on Chittagong.Pacific Zone.New Guinea and Bismarck Archipelago.43. On the 6th the enemy attempted a number of attacks on the airfield atWau. These were successfully repelled by Allied fighters who claimed to have destroyed 21 fighters and three bombers, probably destroyed ten fighters and damaged three bombers and two fighters; in addition, two enemy aircraft were shot down by A.A. fire; our own losses were reported to be very light. On thesame day U.S. Mitchells (B. 25) and Beaufighters attacked Lae airfield, startinga number of fires and obtaining hits on buildings.

APPENDIX YI.Ah&apos; Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the past week : Germany.Berlin.Further reports have been received concerning the recent attacks : (i) During the first attack the anti-aircraft guns are stated to have beenmanned chiefly by factory workers and civilian officials and aconsiderable number of Flak personnel were moved into Berlin onthe following day,(ii) The Lorenz Radio Factory was considerably damaged and the RiedelChemical Works were also hit. Both these works are near theTempelhof aerodrome, and are of considerable importance. TheLorenz Works are makers of wireless, telephone and teleprinter equip-ment, in addition to their importance as suppliers to the G.A.F. ofblind-flying and radio aid apparatus. At the chemical works fourbuildings are stated to have been completely burnt out.(iii) In  buildings between  Sachsische Strasse and. Bayerische  Strasse,Wilmersdorf, 100 flats were destroyed and between 200 and 300damaged. The fires which started in these buildings are said to haveraged throughout most of the night.(iv) In the Teltow area, factory buildings were damaged, including somebelonging to the Daimler Benz Works.(v) In Lichterade and in south-east Steglitz, two or three flak batteries were destroyed, and in Lichterade east and west there was severe firedamage to houses.(vi) Heavy H.E. and fire incidents occurred in a district just north-west of the- Tiergarten, at least two streets of houses being severely damaged, and in the south-east suburb of Karlshorst a number ofworkers&apos; dwellings were destroyed and some 50 families renderedhomeless.(vii) Near Zahringer Strasse, Wilmersdorf, a heavy bomb destroyed threehouses and damaged 20 more.Occupied France.Lorient.Photographs taken on 4th February reveal the following damage caused inthe raids of 26th/27th January and 29th/30th January : (i) In the arsenal a long shed on the western boundary has been guttedand anothe&apos;&apos; shed south of the ships&apos; stores destroyed.(ii) In the Port au Guerre two buildings south of the U-boat shelters havebeen damaged and in the railway, station one building is gutted.(iii) In addition, two small factories and several sheds south of the railway,station have been damaged or destroyed.Comines.A report of the damage resulting from a particularly successful daylight attack by two Bostons on 29th August, 1942, has been received. A bomb whichexploded in the 25,000-voit switchgear caused complete stoppage of the power station. The 10,000-volt switchgear was damaged at the same time, thus cutting off all local supplies in the Comines district. Not until 20th t September was atemporary low-tension network in operation, and on 19th October the stationcapacity was still only 10 per cent, of normal. Only on 30th November, 13 weeks after the raid, was the capacity restored to the figure obtaining prior to the attack.As for the parts actually damaged, it is believed that reconstruction of the civil engineering work must have taken five months, and that of the electrical equipment would taken twelve months.
Occupied Holland.Flushing.Photographs taken on 8th February show that as a result of the attacks on&apos; 21st and 25th January the shipbuilding shed of the De Schelde shipyard, west ofthe marine dock, has a 32-ft. by 32-ft. hole in its roof, and a shed on the westside of Inner Haven East is severely damaged. The blast wall of an oil storagetank has been hit, and the roof of a shed near the aerodrome is one-thirddestroyed.tItaly.Spezzia.A photographic reconnaissance following the attack of 4th/5th Februaryshows roof damage to four sheds in the gas works, one of them being damaged overan area of 185 ft by 32 ft. At least one other building in the same area has also received roof damage, and on the north-east side of the Piazza d&apos;armies a largebuilding is damaged by fire.Denmark.Copenhagen.A reliable source reports that, as a result of the attack on 27th January,considerable damage was caused to the Burmeister and Wain Works by delayedaction bombs which were exploded by the Danes within three days.(1) In the main workshop, many high-precision machines and lathes were seriously damaged.(2) One bomb which exploded while lying on the Works Manager&apos;s steelwriting-table demolished his room and the blue-print room next door.(3) Three bombs burst on the concrete floor of the main hall, causing much damage to machinery, and partly lifting the roof of the building.The adjacent building was also damaged.It is considered that, as a result, full production in these works will be held up for some time.
