TRAINING   FOR   THE   BUILDING   industry i. The building industry will occupy a special position in the tasks freconstruction alter trie war and the Government have been devoting CVattention to the problems with which it will be confronted. There can bno doubt that there will be an unprecedented demand and need for buildinnin the post-war years and that a rapid but orderly expansion ol the industrvwill be necessary if it is to be able satisfactorily to discharge the heavvresponsibilities which will be imposed on it. It is fully recognised that this expansion must be adequately planned in advance in full co-operation withthe industry:2. In their study of the many questions involved, the Government havehad the benefit of an exhaustive and valuable report on training for theindustry made to the Minister of Works and Planning by the education committee of the Central Council for Works and TJiulcIings. The Committeehave studied the question of normal recruitment to the industry, coveringapprenticeship training, technical education, and training for nianagement1as well as the question of what additional provision by way of sp^ciaitraining for adults will be needed to meet the anticipated deficiency in the skilled labour force of the industry in the immediate post-war years.The Government have given the report the careful consideration which itmerits; certain points arising from it have been the subject of further discussion with representatives of the industry, and the proposals outlined in this memorandum have been formulated on the basis of the agreement reached at the discussions. Any long-term plan and the machinery to giveeffect to it must of necessity be subject to continuous review in the lightof experience, but in view of the great importance which attaches to thedevelopment of the building and civil engineering industry, it is considered desirable to state now the position which has been reached and the lineof action which the Government propose to follow in preparation for thepost-war building task.The Building Programme.3. It is fully recognised that if the necessary expansion of the labour force is to be achieved without disorganising the industry, it must be carefullyplanned in relation to a long-term programme of construction. The Govern-ment are working on this principle and are drawing up their plans accordingly,but it will be realised that at this stage of the war any construction pro-grammes must be provisional. In preparing them many assumptions haveto be made, including assumptions as to the supply of raw materials, par-ticularly those for which we are dependent on imports. On the basis, however,of all the facts available at present, it is considered that a post-war construe-tion programme designed for telij^/ears &quot;will require the labour force in thebuilding industry tq^ be built up^ov-ei^a periocl to about 1,250,000 men. Itwill be an essential parFoTThe expansion that&apos; recruitment into the industryshall be regulated so as to correspond as closely as possible with the estimatedfuture demands of the construction programme. The aim will be to maintainstability in the industry for the period of the programme.Regularity of Employment.4. In addition to the laying down of a long-term programme of building,a further condition of a satisfactory expansion of the labour force of theindustry is the establishment, under adequate guarantees, of conditions ofwork which will, as far as possible, eliminate the casual form of engagementwhich was formerly the most unsatisfactory characteristic of employment in
miadopt!&apos;Cllou y&apos;---------------------- ----     - -    - a       i       ^iteed payment in the industry should be determined by the negotiatingnery within the industry itself. The Government would favour theon by the building industry of measures for a guaranteed period oflovment and, if requested, would consider favourably the continuance atr    ,   .:____ immwlintp  nnst-war   nprinrl   nf   the nrftsent  eitatntorv   nro-6 &quot;during the immediate post-war period of the present statutory pro--;. s controlling registered building and civil engineering contracting under-rtines which require all such undertakings to observe the terms and con-dVons of employment agreed in the industry.Expansion of the skilled labour force.- If the total labour force of the building industry is to be expanded tothe size indicated, special action will need to be taken to secure the expansionf the force of craftsmen in the industry in the first three or four years following the end of the war. Even when full account has been taken of the trainedroen who will be returning from the Services or other war work, it is abun-dantly clear that there will be a large deficiency which cannot be made good,, normal method of recruitment and apprenticeship training of boys andmust therefore, be met by the special training of adults on a large scale. Itis proposed that this training should be undertaken and paid for by the\ state, on the lines described in paragraphs 7-11 below.6 It is doubtful whether in the immediate post-war years ordinary recruit-ment and apprenticeship training will be able to&apos; do much more than make good the current wastage in the industry. It is recognised that the futurewell-being of the industry requires that its permanent system of recruitment,education and apprenticeship training should be developed and extended tobring it more fully into accord with the needs of the post-war situation.On a long-term view, this matter is probably the most important withwhich the industry has to deal, and the Government are prepared to playItheir part in working out improved arrangements. It is convenient to dealwith this subject separately from the transitional question of special training,land it is more fully discussed in paragraphs 13-18 below.\Special Adult Training.7. The object of the special training scheme is to fill the anticipated gaplin the supply of skilled workers in the immediate post-war years by givingintensive courses of instruction to selected men who are likely to becometreasonably efficient craftsmen and to take their places as permanent workersfin the industry. The plan is, therefore, of a short-term nature, to providejpor the period in which ordinary methods of recruitment by apprenticeshiplire unable to meet the demands which the building programme, as ultimatelydetermined, will make. While it is not possible at this stage to determineexactly the deficiency in the supply of skilled men which will need to bemet by special training, there can be no doubt that it will be large and theIplan is therefore being prepared on the basis that training will have to be[provided lor up to 200,000 men during the first three or four years of the? programme.If any scheme of special training on the contemplated scale is to be aguccess, it is essential that it should have the good will and co-operation of the^industry at every stage, and the Government have been much encouraged by the helpful manner in which the representatives of the industry haveapproached the problem. In formulating their proposals, the Governmentliave aimed at making such arrangements as will foster the co-operative spiritland ensure the whole-hearted assistance of the industry in promoting theIsuccess of the scheme.
9. In accordance with this aim, it is accepted as a basic principle tthe industry must fully participate in and be associated, both centrally .locally,  with the administration of the schemes of special training toTprovided by the Ministry ol Labour and National Service and with ttprocess of selection for training.   This association should be secured inmanner winch gives due recognition to the responsibilities and interest- !the State and the industry respectively.To give effect to this principle, the Government propose to make theing arrangements:  (a) Headquarters arrangements.A Building Industry Advisory Panel is to be established to be preside over by the Minister of&apos;Labour and National Service, or his deputy, whichwill cover all relevant labour questions arising on the building programmeUnder the Panel there is to be a Special Training Committee, normallypresided over by an official, to consider technical and other mattessuch as:  (i) the number of persons to be admitted to training over a givenperiod;(ii) the proportion between different occupations;(iii) the methods to be adopted in selecting persons for training andthe considerations affecting selection;(iv) the curriculum of training;(v) the nature of the trade test to be applied;(vi) the standard of proficiency to be attained to qualify for admission to the Industry ;(vii) the development of &quot; retraining&quot; schemes, for men already idthe industry, to meet requirements of new processes and techniques.(b) Local Arrangements.Local Advisory Committees, attached to the Employment Exchanges,are to be set up to assist in the selection of applicants for training, theCommittees wili act as selection panels from which members will be drawn to sit with the officials in the Exchanges when applicants ate being inter-viewed, but the final decision to accept or reject an applicant must be theresponsibility of the Ministry of Labour and National Service. The Cora-mittees will also assist in facilitating the entry of trainees into the industryand, in the areas where the Training Centres are located, will be looked to for advice on methods of training for help in publicising the Centres and similar matters.10. In working out these arrangements, both at Headquarters and locally,full account will be taken of the special requirements and interests of theCivil Engineering as well as the Building Industry. The Ministry of Labonrand National Service will be responsible for providing the special training,whether it is given in Government Training Centres or in technical or similarinstitutions, but will work in close collaboration with the Education Dcpart-ments and Ministry of Works and Planning.ii. While it will not be necessary to put these arrangements into full effect until the end of the war is in sight, it is recognised that there is muchpreparatory work to be done and many questions which will require close examination if the special training schemes are to be smoothly inauguratedwhen the need arises. It is, therefore, the Governments intention to estab-lish the Headquarters organisation in the near future and to proceed with thelocal organisation at the appropriate time.
framing Overseas. ,There is little doubt that the great part of the training will need toI2,-vcn jn this country and the arrangements have been devised on thatOption.   It will, however, be necessary to consider the position of men^the Forces overseas, especially if it appears that large forces wiil have with  kept abroad for a considerable time after hostilities have ceased.   The-&apos;sion of training course overseas presents a special problem on whichjfre will be consultation between the industry and the Government Depart-nts concerned, when the Advisory Panel has been established, and thetraining Plan nas been furtner advanced.Apprenticeship Training and. Technical Education.j9 There is a clear distinction between the permanent question of theenrtroent and education of boys for the industry and the transitional ques-tion of filling the gap in the immediate post-war years by the special training&apos; adults.   Apart from the State&apos;s responsibility for supervising and grant-oiiding technical instruction, apprenticeship training, unlike special adult train-n will not be provided and paid for by the State and the various questionswhich arise in controlling apprenticeship are traditionally settled by thendustry itself.14. At the same time the Government have a particular interest in thentry of young people into industry and in their progress and welfare afterentrv and it is, therefore, regarded as essential that the Ministry of WorksndPlanniogr-together with the Ministry of Labour and National Service andhe Education Departments should be closely associated with the formulationnd operation of apprenticeship schemes, and with the training of youths forcraftsmanship and for management.In order to stimulate a supply of suitable apprentices, the Education Depart-nents, at the request of the Ministry of Works and Planning, have alreadyncouraged Local Education Authorities to increase substantially the numberfull-time Junior courses in Technical Schools prior to employment. Thisrevision has been made in co-operation with representatives of the industryd it is intended that it should become the main channel of entry to appren-lceship. In addition steps are being taken to establish full-time Seniorourses at suitable centres, with the object of providing a pool from which,fter further practical training, a proportion of the managerial staff can berawn.15. The Government fully endorse the view that, in the building industry,high value attaches to the apprenticeship system as the recognised methodtraining in employment and of entry into the ranks of the skilled workers,e industry has not in the past neglected the importance of developing itsiapprenticeship schemes, but it is generally recognised that they follow nocomprehensive and systematic plan, and that the time has come to surveye whole field with a view to putting recruitment and apprenticeship trainingn the soundest possible basis, and maintaining such basis at all times.16. To this end, the Government are prepared to take the initiative intablishing without delay an Apprenticeship and Training Council for theuilding Industry which will be primarily representative of the industry butill include representatives of other important interested bodies, as well as of u Government Departments concerned. The Council will be presided overy an independent Chairman to be appointed by the Ministry of Worksnd Planning which will be responsible at the outset for providing the Secre-proletariat and financing the Council; the CounciPs primary function will be tobserve and advise on all matters concerning the recruitment,  education
jjersons lor the industry, both for craftsmanship aaJind lo encourage by all appropriate means the development ofcraft apprenticeship schemes and student apprenticeship schemes on a com-prehensive basis.17. While it is not desirable to attempt to formulate in any detail the sub.jeets with which the Council will be concerned, the following are given as some indication of the apprenticeship q-questions to which it is thought the council will wish to devote early attention:  (a) the comprehensive review of existing apprenticeship schemes,(b) the definition of minimum standards to which approved schemes should conform, . .(c) the maintenance of a register of apprentices in training under approved schemes and the issue of certificates on completion of training,(d) the promotion of publicity designed to stimulate interest in buildingas a career,(e) practical methods of encouraging employers and apprentices to par-anticipate in approved schemes.iS. The Council will naturally also have a close interest in the developmentof technical education for the industry, in the form both oi pre-employmenteducation and of continued vocational training including day-time releaseduring apprenticeship. It is agreed that the existing facilities for technical education, from the junior school level to the University, need-to be carefullysurveyed in the light of the demands to be made by the post-war expansionof the industry, and it is hoped that the Council will be in a position to makea valuable contribution to the work to be done in this field. The council should also be able to assist as regards the training of instructors for technical education and of suitable entrants for the higher managerial posts in theindustry.19. It is contemplated that the Council will not need to establish localorganisations, but will aim at securing at all levels close co-operation and association between trade bodies concerned with apprenticeship training andthe local representatives of the interested Government Departments, togetherwith the authorities charged with higher education.    lhe council will notencroach upon the field of the joint industrial councils which handle sucitlmatters as the regulation of wages, hours and conditions of employment fcfcraftsmen, apprentices and trainees alike.20. While it is necessary for the scheme of special training for adults to bedealt with through a separate organisation, it is clearly essential that thereshould be close liaison with the Council in order that the training and appren-apprenticeship programmes may be kept in step and considered together in relationto the estimated intake of labour required to fulfil the demands of the building programme. The representation of the Government Departments on theCouncil will assist in this direction and, in making its nominations to theCouncil and to the Building Industry Advisory Panel (para. 9 (a)) respec-tively, the industry will have an opportunity to facilitate close relationship between them and to promote similarity of outlook on the problem of post-war recruitment as a whole.(25230)   wt.75   243   D.L.
