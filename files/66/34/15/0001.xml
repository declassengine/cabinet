flS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E G R E T.W.P.(4g) 65.15th FEBRUARY,  1945e . COPY NO.     - ^WAF. CABINET.:-..VERlDGE REPORT.-JJQM..hY the Prime Minister^I think we should handle this matter in thefollowing way, which I gather from the reports I have seen is very much what my colleagues desire.1.      This approach to social security bringing themagic of averagesnearer to the rescue of the millionsconstitutes an essential part of any post-war scheme ofnational betterment.2-v      There may be portions   of it which would probably not be found workable or acceptable, and these we have indicated in the speeches made in this Debate.      It isdesirable however that should the measure be producedit should be an integral conception and. not merely whatis left after the critics have pulled out certain weakpoints co.      There should be a body, if necessary a Commission,set up to work from now till the end of the war polishing,reshaping and preparing for the necessary legislation.4.      We cannot however initiate the legislation now or coma nit ourselves to the expenditure involved.      that can only be done by a responsible Government and a Houseof Commons refreshed by contact with the people.     We donot know what conditions will be at the end of the war or how the expenditure on social insurance will fit in with other social expenditure desired or how this group of betterment expenditure can be reconciled to the needsof maintaining strong naval and air forces and a certain military force for a considerable time.     We do not know what Government is going to be in power after the war,or what Prime Minister.      We should get everything ready for them and leave them a free hand to take up or reject ascheme which will be perfected in itself.5.      We must not forget that we are a Parliament inthe eighth year and we have only been justified in pro-Ion; ring our existence by the physical fact of the war situation and for the purposes of the war.      We have no right whatever to tie the hands of future Parliaments inregard to social matters which are their proper province.I could not as Prime Minister be responsible at this stagefor binding ray successor whoever he may be without know-ledge of the conditions under which he will undertake hisresponsioiliti es.W-.S.C.10* Downing Street, S-W,.loP14th February., 19430
