PORTAL.February 22, 1943.(1)FACTUAL STATEMENT ON THE LORIENT BASE AND ONBOMBING ATTACKS.General Situation at Lorient.Lorient is a small dockyard town with a pre-war population of 45,000,economically dependent on the naval dockyard and shipbuilding industries. The32 U-boat shelters, with four exceptions, are on the Keroman Peninsula, 1-g. milesfrom the naval dockyard and parts of the town. They are constructed ofreinforced bomb-proof concrete. They contain workshops and machine-shops,believed to be fitted out with machine tools and gear equivalent to that found onour own depot ships, and the U-boats can be dry-docked therein. U-boats arehauled up a slipway on rails and traversed on an open pit into the necessaryshelter. U-boats can be refuelled and loaded with torpedoes while in the pens.There is limited sleeping accommodation for crews in the shelters, where there isa dormitory approximately 80 feet x 50 feet.Labour at U-boat base.2.   In September 1942 there were 2,560 Frenchmen employed in the dock-yard, working some 650,000 man hours per month.   Of these, 600,000 were on[25069] B
German account&apos;either directly connected with the repair of U-boats or for maintenance of minesweepers, escort vessels, or general maintenance of the port.With the increased number of U-boats in the port this figure is likely to haveincreased. A few Frenchmen may be employed in the shelters, but the majorityare probably employed in the&apos; dockyard on such work as the foundries, boilershops, working tugs, driving lorries, &amp;c. The, harbour launches and tugs are known to be manned by Frenchmen.3. Work on the U-boats themselves is probably done by imported Germandockyard workmen and by German seamen who are awaiting U-boats. A german-boat prisoner has stated that he lived in the barracks (now destroyed) in the dockyard and was taken by boat to the shelters at Keroman to work, returning to barracks for dinner and at night The number of persons working in the pensis not known, but may be estimated at 2.000 to 2.500.4. Since attacks on the town began the civilian population has been evacuated, and similar measures have been taken at Brest. St. Nazaire andLa Pallice. It is very doubtful, however, whether the German authorities would permit skilled and essential French workers to depart from the area.Particulars of attacks by Bomber Command.5. The following table is a record of bombing attacks on Lorient since thespecial operations were ordered :  1943.	Aircraft Despatched.	Aircraft Attacked.	Tons of H.E.

Five aircraft were missing.Damage Inflicted.6. At annexure &quot;A&quot; is a damage plot of the town showing the total areadevastated as a result of these attacks. Shortly stated, the position is that thetown is virtually devastated. There at*e two main areas of complete destruction,one amounting to about 160 acres on the N.E. side of,the Bassin a Flot, whichcomprises the old town and most of the arsenal and the other of about 70 acreson the S.W. side of that Bassin, consisting mainly of industrial property. In theold town not more than 5 per cent, of the houses retained their roofs, and in thesuburbs approximately 50 per cent, of the houses aie in the same condition.Naval dockyard and port facilities.7. The following buildings in the arsenal and adjoining dockyards havebeen severely damaged or totally destroyed :  The Naval Barracks. The Log Store.The Welding Shop. Both Power Stations.Repair Shops. Ships Stores.The Boiler Shop. Covered Timber Yard.The Foundry. Wood Workshop.The Drawing Office.
Skelters at Keroman.8. Four craters are seen on the roof of the centre pen and very serious,damage has been caused to the machine shops and offices immediately adjoiningthe pens, most of the buildings being destroyed. No damage can be seen to theslipway and pit by means of which U-boats enter the shelters.Military and Public Utilities.9. 75 per cent, of the Frebault Barracks are now destroyed. The townelectricity works and the water works have been destroyed but alternative suppliesof power could be obtained from the Grid system. Telephone and rail communi-cations have been interrupted and emergency feeding services operated.Effect on operation of U-boats as. known to elate.10. (i) There has been some reduction in the number of U-boats arriving at and leaving Lorient, but this cannot with certainty be attributed toour attacks.(ii) Early in the attacks there is good evidence (B. 1) to show that the departure of two U-boats was delayed and one destined to return toLorient was diverted and arrived at St. Nazaire.(iii) After the attack of the 7th February, U-boats due to sail had notsuffered damage which affected their seagoing efficiency, and theircrews were available for duty (B. 1).(iv) On about the 17th February at least one U-boat was able to enter theport.According to a further report from a reliable source (B. 1) on the17th February, at least three further U-boats then at sea were toreturn to Lorient on completion of their cruises.Additional reports received 2Qth February.11. (a) A secret report, dated the 16th February, 1943, and graded B. 3,states that 11 U-boats of 740 tons were &quot;held up &quot; at Keroman onaccount of lack of current and damage to the slips, &amp;c.(b) A further report from the same source, and also graded B. 3, gave theidentifications of the 11 U-boats.It is not clear whether the U-boats were &quot;held up,&quot; i.e, their departure was delayed, or whether work on the boats was delayed forthe reasons given, and the boats may yet have been ready to sail on or within a few days of their expected dates. In the latter sense thereport is considered credible and shows that delays have been causedby the bombing attacks.(c) A further report from the same source, but graded B. 4, states that14 U-boats are at Brest, of which 5 are under repair, and that these5 U-boats are ones normally based on Lorient.The identification of these U-boats is not correct and a check ofthese identifications is being obtained. This part of the report shouldbe received with, reserve and should not at present be regarded as evidence of dislocation at Lorient.(2)THE CASE FOR THE CONTINUATION OF THE BOMBING of u-BOAT OPERATIONAL BASES.Memorandum by the First Sea Lord.Seriousness of the present Shipping Situation.12. (a) The shipping shortage does and will limit the application in the selected areas of the great war potential which is being produced by the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom.(b) A considerable part of the war potential which is produced is lost at sea..(c) The import situation is a serious one.(d) The build-up of &quot; Bolero &quot; is severely handicapped.(e) We may well be faced with such heavy shipping losses that we shall be unable to continue the North Atlantic convoys with our present scale of escorts.[25069] b 2
Unless we are prepared to accept a large reduction in imports, this wouldresult in an urgent call for escorts which could only be met at the expense of oneor both of the following : (i) Overseas operations,(ii) North Russian convoys.Danger of basing our calculations on the improved situation during the last three months.13. The shipping losses during the last three months have been considerably less than those of the preceding months. The reason for this is that generally wehave been able to route our convoys more or less clear of the heavy U-boat packswhich have been waiting for them.This has been due to the fact that the U-boats have been very talkative andwe have been able to plot their positions by D/F-ing their signals.There are signs, however, that they realise that we have been able to routeour convoys clear of the U-boat packs, and there is a distinct tendency for theU-boats to use their wireless less frequently.How the situation may develop in an adverse manner.14. (a) The number of U-boats operating is consistently increasing, as weare not &quot; killing &quot; them as fast as they can come into operation.(b)- Should the U-boats cease to be so garrulous with their wireless, we should lose the power of evasion, and we should only have two alternatives, both ofwhich will be expensive :  (i) For the convoys to fight their way through the U-boat packs at a timewhen escorts are inadequate and the V.L.R. aircraft for covering the convoys are not fully in operation.(ii) To route the convoyrs further south, in which case they would be deprived of air cover until such time as we obtain the use of the Azores.Possible ways of mitigating the adverse development referred to in paragraph above.15.   The possibilities are as follows :  (i) Increased escorts: Owing to the necessity of reducing the cycle of the convoys, more escort groups will be required, and in view of operational requirements there seems&apos; no possibility of materiallyincreasing the strength of the individual escort groups before thelatter part of the year as all new construction will be absorbed byoperation a 1 requirements.(ii) Increased air protection. This is being increased, but we do not knowto what extent the operation of V.L.R. aircraft from Newfoundlandwill be effective.(iii) Use of Escort Carriers. These will not come into service at a sufficientrate to make any great difference in the next six months, and it isyet to be proved how effective they are, and whether they themselveswill survive the U-boat attacks.(iv) Bombing of U-boat operational ba.ses.Necessity of dealing with all U-boat bases and not only one.16. The U-boat bases must be regarded as one objective. It is generallyadmitted that any offensive must be driven right through to the finish and notstopped prematurely. To desist now is to do so when only a part of the taskhas been completed.The harm done to the U-boat campaign by the bombing of Lorient can tosome extent be absorbed and remedied in the other ports if they are left intact,and the enormous effort made by Bomber Command against Lorient will have lost much of its value.Method of attack on U-boat bases which shoidd now be pursued.17. (a) An examination of Part 1 of this paper shows that there has been almost complete destruction of the town and dock areas.(b) It is the considered opinion of officers who have been responsible for themaintenance of submarines that the destruction which has already been causedat Lorient must decrease the number of U-boats which can be fully maintained
,-and operated. This will, of course, not only be due to material destruction, butto the incontrovertible fact that dockyard workmen and submarine crews cannotmaintain the same standard of work and output under the strain of the constantthreat and frequent reality of heavy air attack and the resulting conditions whichdeprive them of practically every form of relaxation and even the most ordinaryamenities. ,(c) We have further information that a certain number of U-boats have hadto return to Lorient with defects shortly after sailing, which is not at all a usualstate of affairs and may well have been caused either by damage from blast orjnd i f f reference t wor k in an sh i p.Id) These valuable results have been obtained by the devastation of Lorienttown and clock areas and, if the same treatment were applied to the remainingU-boat bases in the Biscay ports, there is no doubt, in my opinion, that the effect would be a very considerable decline in the maintenance capacity of the ports andwould cause a substantial reduction in the number of U-boats that could operatefrom them.The fact remains, however, that we cannot deny the use of these portscompletely to the U-boats until the submarine pens have been destroyed.(e) Information from agents indicates that the Germans intend strengtheningboth the tops and the sides of the pens and, consequently, they must havemisgivings as to whether the concrete of the pens cannot be penetrated.(/) It is considered, therefore, that the correct procedure for bombing theU-boat operational bases should be (i) to subject the remaining Biscay port bases to area bombing as has beendone in the case of Lorient, and(ii) to attack the pens themselves with heavy armour-piercing bombs.Time Factor.18. The point at issue is whether our Bomber Force should continue to bombU-boat operational bases whenever possible, or whether it should revert to apriority in the bombing of Germany. The time factor is all important as regardsthe bombing of the U-boat operational bases, as successful results wouldameliorate the immediate situation and that for the next few months. It ishoped that, once we have really dealt with these bases, it will not be necessarysubsequently to divert a very large number of bombers on to them.The bombing of Germany is a long-term project.German Morale.19. At the present time the German Command can have little hope of winning the war except by the U-boat campaign, and it is therefore considered,that if we can master the U-boat menace to an extent which will make themrealise that any hopes in this direction are false ones, we shall have done just asmuch, if not more, to affect the morale of the German Command than would bedone by the bombing which had been given up in order to bomb U-boatoperational bases.Conclusion.20. The next six to nine months of the U-boat war are likely to be the most critical for the reasons which have been given above.It is essential, therefore, at once to do everything possible, whether by.sinking U-boats or affecting their maintenance to minimise the damage they can do to us$ during the above period.The results which have been achieved by the bombing of Lorient, even withour so far imperfect knowledge of the degree to which the maintenance facilitieshave been affected, are considered to be sufficient to justify the continuation ofthe policy of bombing the U-boat operational bases.Hence, the suggestion to discontinue any further operations for a month,whilst better information of the results of the bombing is obtained, is considered to be quite unacceptable in the present state of the U-boat war.
AIR STAFF VIEWS ON BOMBING OF U-BOAT BASES.21. The Air Staff have consistently maintained that area attack of the bay of Biscay U-boat ports could not seriously affect the operation of submarinesfrom the bases.   This view was based on the grounds that (i) the submarines themselves, located in the pens or at dispersed moorings,were virtually invulnerable to night attack;(ii) the facilities required  for the maintenance  and minor repair of submarine craft were limited and could be accommodated within theshelters or otherwise protected or dispersed;(iii) power, water and light could be supplied independently of the townservices;(iv) the crews and maintenance personnel could be accommodated either inthe shelters or in the surrounding countryside;(v) in the light of the importance to Germany of the submarine campaign and the effort involved in the construction of submarine shelters, these additional facilities would present a comparatively small problem.22. It is considered that major repairs to submarines in the dockyard mightbe affected by heavy attack. Lack of these facilities would be an inconveniencebut submarines requiring major repair could return to Germany and be replaced by reserve craft.23. Despite these convictions, we have made the experiment; 4,286 tons of bombs have been dropped on Lorient in rather less than five weeks and the townhas been laid waste. Although we cannot expect full evidence of the result forsome time, information now available indicates no marked effect upon theoperation of the submarines and indicates that the enemy intend to continueto operate U-boats from Lorient.24. Some temporary dislocation is to be expected, but when the enemy hasaccommodated himself to the new conditions the operations will probably beunaffected by continued area attack. A distinction should be drawn betweentemporary dislocation and the permanent results which can lie expected when theenemy has adjusted himself to the new conditions.25. The attacks on Lorient have absorbed half our bomber effort over thepast five weeks. If the result is the virtual abandonment of the port as a U-boatbase the expenditure of effort will have been well worth while, and the Air staff will be keen to see the three remaining ports dealt with in the same way as soonas possible. If. on the other hand, the enemy succeeds, after a period of dislocation-tion. in re-establishing the necessary facilities and continues to use Lorient on asubstantial scale, the Air Staff will regard this as confirmation of their view that area attacks on these ports are unprofitable in themselves and wastefid of effort which should be directed on to Germany and Italy, and will therefore oppose theextension of blitz attacks on the other ports.26. The Air Staff are strongly against the proposal to proceed now withthe attack of St. Nazaire while waiting to see the effect of that on Lorient. Itmight well take three months to do the same amount of damage to St. Nazaire,Brest and La Pallice, and if by that time Lorient was again being used on asubstantial scale it Avould doubtless be proposed that the round should begin again,and if this were done we should be well on the way to diverting a large part ofour bomber effort against these bases permanently, but with little effect on theU-boat war. but with disastrous effect on the air offensive against Germany andItaly.27. For this reason the Air Staff are anxious that no further large-scalenight attacks should be ordered until it can be shown that the Lorient attacks have succeeded in putting the port virtually out of action as a U-boat base. they suggest that a report should be made in one month&apos;s time, unless in the meamvhileit can be shown conclusively that the attacks have, or have not,- achieved their purpose as stated above.
