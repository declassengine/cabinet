0^ -^jljc^j   hjMAJESTYTS33THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANITICqOFY NO.333.8      The presidents letter of 30th November, 19U2, to theprime Minister contained the following undertaking:&quot;I therefore want to /jive yon the assurance that from our expanding fleet you may depsndon the tonnage necessary to meet your import programme..   Accordingly I am instructingour Shipping Administration to allocatee throughthe machinery of the Combined Shipping Boardsenough dry cargo tonnage out of the surplusship^buil&amp;iag to meet your imports and thesupply and maintenance of your armed forces and other services essential to maintaining the war effort of the British commonwealth to the extent that they cannot be transportedby the fleet under British control61.2e      In the negotiations? note was taken of 27 million tons asbeing 18a substantially sorre^t53 figure of UoK* import requirements and a figure of 300?000 tons a month (cumulative throughout theyear 19U3) was msBtloaad as a measure of the assistance required^.3*      Three wmliB ego, the War Shipping Ateinistration placed before the Ooabised skipping Adjustment B&amp;ard (Washington) theattached statement of tbeir interpretation of the instructions which they had ffesoived tmu the presidente and their present intention as to the method of carrying them out.he      The WoSeAe QQ%mm&amp;&amp;&amp;%&amp;Qm appealed to whittle away theintention of the Presidents assurance by a geriea of limitationsand qualifications ^hich8 la theis? eumulatiw effect,, might go furto destroy its valueo   This impression was naturally deepenedthe inadequacy of tke figures of ^ssistanse issntionedaOn the $rd February B therefore * the Soa^ined ShippingAdjustment Board (London; made the following communication to theWashington Boards-MThe additional U*8* assistance indicated in theWar Shipping Administration communication fallsso far short of the amount required to sustain the UaKe Import programmep sad so far short ofthe president&apos;s assurance to the prime Minister,that -the London Board must press for an eaplyand substantial increase in the allocationsApart from the great gap between British needs and British resources, serious risks of congestion,escort difficulties, and emergency diversions oftonnage to military operations would be run ifthere is an under import in the early months ofthe yea? and stocks are run down to or belowdanger level in the hope of redressing theposition in the late summer or early autumxu

The cumulative effect of deficiencies in theearly months might well mount up to figures which it would be impossible to make good in thelatter part of the year.The W.S.A.  apparently offer in the first five months of the year a total of 1,155,000 tons of cargo.    About 50,000 tons a month are not net butrepresent the average rate of assistance inBolero ships at the time of the President1sdecision.    This had already been taken intoaccount in computing the deficiency of Britishresources to meet British&apos;needs.    The additionalsupport to the British import programme in thefirst six months of the year on this basis, after allowing for losses, might be no more than 800,000January is now gone and the additional assistancein that month will have been less  than50,000tons apparently.    We are already therefore becoming involved in the difficulties inseparable frompostponement of the allocations at the full levelsWriting in November,  the president said thatallocations would be short &quot;for the next threemonths&quot; and this is realised, but it is of urgentimportance that the allocation from March onwardsshould be raised substantially above the average level required in order to pick up the lag whichhas already been suffered&quot;.5e Sir Arthur Salte-r reported on the 8th February that the maincurrent difficulty in making allocations has been the delays inU.S* vessels returning from the pacific where many have been detained for long periods, while at the same time there hare been largeurgent demands for ships for Russia and North Africa.    He addedthat he had covered the whole ground very fully in discussion withthe War Shipping Administration, who are now completing a fullreview of the tonnage situation, which will have to take intoaccount the effects of the Casablanca decisions.    He hopes that ata meeting next week W.S.A. will be able to make additionalallocations to the U.K.  and informs me that if the review should show that without serious restrictions of other requirements, i.e*Army and Navy, it is not possible to make additional to the UeK-allocation so substantial as in their opinion to give reasonableinstalments of the president&apos;s promise, the War ShippingAdministration will seek authority of the president to impose thenecessary restrictions on competing claims.6*        We are still without a definite indication of the amountof assistance we may expect to receive to make up our imports in the first six months of 19k3,  and as this is so material a factor in our plans. I think it right to report the positionwithout delay.    It is for consideration whether we should await the new figures from the W.S.A. later in the month, as SirSir Arthur Salter advises, in preference to making an immediateappeal at a high level for the carrying out of the president&apos;undertaking.L.Ministry of War Transport.JOgl February, l$h3&apos;.      -

To       Combined Shipping Adjustment Board,London.W.S.A. communicated to C.S.A.B. on 19th January forinformation following statement of their intentions:-&quot;The W.S.A. have received from the President instructionsto carry out that portion of the President&apos;s letter of30th November, 1942 to the Prime Minister which dealswith allocation UoS.A0 controlled tonnage to british service during 1943*     These instructions are interpretedto mean(l)    that in accordance with the C.S.A.B. paper Wo 1*2/167 of6th October, 1942, approved by the President enoughU.S. controlled tonnage is to be allocated each month to the British import service or other essential U0Koservice to maintain the British War Programme at anunimpaired level of activity.     Any figures of tonnagethat may have been quoted as representing the amount required for this purpose are to be taken as estimateonly and not as commitment to allocate a preciseamount of shipping.(2)   That if review indicates that the UcK. import of 27million tons or other UoK   services can be reducedwithout impairing the mos$ effective use of our combinedresources the tonnage to bu allocated will be correspondingly reducedo(3)   That any economies effected in any way in the use ofUoKo or U.S9 controlled ships employed in U*K. service will be reflected in a reduction of the additionaltonnage to be allocated such service,,(It)   That if U.S, controlled ship losses exceed the estimatedlosses may bo necessary to make downward adjustments in the amount of U* SoA. controlled tonnage to be allocated.(5)   That if the U.SoAa construction programmes fail to meetestimated volume of production adjustment downward inthe amount of tennage to be allocated may become necessary.(6)   That if Military urgency demands the amount ?f UoSoAotonnage to be allocated to British services may bediminlshedo(7)   That all services U.S*A. as well as UaK0 will be subjected to continuous review^     Any reduction foundto be necessary so distributed in accordance with theprovision of the Presidents instructions as to involvethe least impairment of the War programme(8)   That in addition and even though none of the limitationsenumerated above comes to pass the impossibility of allocating the required tonnage during the first fourninths of 1943 will make it impracticable if not impossible to allocate throughout first half 1943 one half of the presently estimated tonnage required duringthe entire year.SECRET oTELEGRAM.Prom   Combined Shipping Adjustment Board,Washington.
