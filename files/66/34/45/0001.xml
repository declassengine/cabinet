SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (43) 95.March 5, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK ,AND^jEYIt is requested that special care may     tiiken toensure the secrecy of this docun\ptWAR CABINET.CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE RESIDENT MINISTER, WESTAFRICA, AND THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL, FRENCH WESTAFRICA, AND BETWEEN THE FORMER AND president roosevelt.I think the attached extract from a most secret and personal letter fromthe Resident Minister, West Africa, dated the 30th January, 1943, reporting onhis recent conversations with the Governor-General, French West Africa, and later with President Roosevelt, will be of interest to my colleagues.Colonial Office, March 5, 1943.I gave you a very full account of my meeting with Boisson in my telegramNo. 77. Without going over the ground again, I can give you in a letter a betteridea of the atmosphere. As luck would have it, early on Sunday morning therewas a dense mist all along the coast, and the R.A.F. warned me I should not beable to land for an hour after the agreed time. I got Cables and Wireless to clear the line and send a most immediate telegram to Boisson at both Porto Novo andCotonu to tell him I should be late. The Cable Company received an acknowlegement-ment that the telegram had been received at Cotonu at 8-20 a.m. I landed atCotonu punctually at the revised time of 10*30, and was met by Boisson; Truitard,the Governor of Dahomey; Gama, Commanding French Air Force, West Africa;and civil and military staffs. I said that I hoped that Boisson got my telegram in time to delay his departure from Porto Novo. He said he had received notelegram, but air travel was always uncertain. Just as we were getting into thecars a messenger strolled up with a telegram. Boisson opened it, and found itwas my telegram with a time receipt at Cotonu Post Office, only a mile away, of8*20 a.m. I said : 11 Well, that lets me out,&quot; and Truitard said : &quot; There will bean enquete of the most formidable!&quot;Boisson was quite cordial from the start, and we talked throughout franklyand without any reserve.As regards his attitude towards the Germans. Boisson said that he had always been determined to keep the Germans out. At one stage, when he hadbeen told that he was to receive representatives of the Disarmament Commission,he had replied that if Germans came he would resign; and that, while he could hold West Africa completelv, he did not think the French Government would find a successor who could. I think his hatred of the Germans is genuine, and,as he was nearly killed in the last war, he has plenty of reason.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.O. S.[25134]Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1943.
The way Boisson met me over the cattle trade was, I thought, significant ofhis willingness to co-operate. He said he was all for this trade going on, hut hewould like to regularise it. The cattle came mostly from tribes a good way fromthe frontiers, and he wanted to ensure that the producer benefited, not a series ofmiddlemen; that a fail1 price neither too high nor too low was paid, and thatveterinary precautions were enforced; and that there should be regular points of entry. With the usual French love of centralisation, he proposed that thisshould be dealt with in Dakar. I said this was very difficult from our point ofview. I was not a Governor-General and we had no centralised administration,and that I should much prefer matters to be settled by local Governors and theirrepresentatives on the spot. Boisson at once abandoned his plan and said that hewould give instructions to Governors on the lines I proposed.When we had disposed of all the problems mentioned in my telegram, wewere entertained to a most sumptuous luncheon with a great deal of very goodwine    There was no question of &quot; postponing the clay of the last dozen.&quot;After luncheon we had a good deal of talk about Colonial problems. TheFrench have done some excellent work in organised marketing and co-operative societies and Soeietes de Prevoyance. Boisson welcomed my suggestion that weshould pool our knowledge and experience in planning for the future. There isa good deal Governors and I ought to know about French practice in marketing.I thought it would be a very good thing to bring Pedler and Smith into this, so Iwrote Boisson a letter afterwards asking for some information about the Frenchsystems and how they worked, and suggested that he should put Pedlcr in touchwith some of his people over this.Boisson told me of his plans for transferring the capital from Porto Novoto Cotonu, which is a much healthier and more attractive place; and he told meof his building plans, both there and at Dakar, which, he said, would have to wait until after the war. He said, rather naively : &quot; I love building.&quot; I said :&quot;All good Empire-builders do. for example Cecil Rhodes.&quot; This produced a tremendous eulogy of Rhodes.There was one other incident which made me feel the meeting had gone well.Dahomey is famous for its native brasswork, of which Truitard has a very finecollection. The gem of the collection was a group of dancers. As I was getting into my plane Truitard murmured to me that he had taken the liberty, with theGovernor-General&apos;s full approval, of putting in a little souvenir of my visit. i thought this was probably a bottle or two of wine, and thanked him. When I gothome and unpacked the parcel I discovered that it was the group of dancers.Boisson sent me the following telegram when he started flving home next day :  &quot; Survolant la Gold Coast je vous adresse. Monsieur le Ministre.1&apos;expression renouvelee du plaisir que j&apos;ai eu hier a vous recevoir a PortoNovo et de ma certitude que notre rencontre servira grandement la causecommune. Je vous demande cEagreer mes sentiments de haute consideration. Boisson.&quot;I replied as follows :  &quot; Many thanks for your telegram. I, too, -am sure that our meetinghas been of real and lasting value to the common cause. I look forward toour continued co-operation throughout West Africa, I hope you will soon be able to pay us a return visit here.  Kindest regards. Swinton.&quot;I am very glad indeed that I had this meeting before Meiklereid and Co.went to Dakar. I heard from Glassford that as the result of our meeting he wassureall our people would have the most cordial reception, and this, as you will see, is borne out by Meikelreid&apos;s own reports.During the following week Ponton brought to see me Geraud-Jouve, whowas on his way to Brazzaville and will be in charge of propaganda there. Wehad a long talk and I was well pleased with Geraud-Jouve&apos;s general attitude. Hewas all for complete fusion between Giraud and de Gaulle, and appeared torealise that there must be a fair amount of give and take : the essential thingwas that they should get together : and the best organisation should follow thiscomplete fusion.   Tt remains to be seen how successful he is in Brazzaville.I also had Casey for a night, which was very useful.I have arranged to let the Americans have some piece-goods to fly up to theFrench airfield at Attar, where they were having difficulty in getting local labour to work unless they had some goods. Before doing this I made sure from Pedlerthat this would not embarrass him or the French.
Now for some account of my meeting with the President. I had an aircraftstanding by, and so I was able to get off when I got your telegram giving thetime of the Presidents arrival. I had, however, rather a chapter of accidents.My aircraft developed some trouble, and we got in to Freetown rather late.As they always have a morning mist, which prevents one getting oft&apos; early fromthe airfield there. I arranged for another aircraft to fly me on that evening,which should have brought me into Bathurst between 9 and 10 at night.After we had been flying for about ten minutes, we developed engine trouble,but luckily were able to get back and land at Freetown just before dark. Theyworked on the aircraft all night, and I got into Bathurst at 11 o&apos;clock the next morning. I went out to the Memphis in the afternoon, and later on we took the President up the Gambia in a naval craft. He was in grand form.He gave me the whole de Gaulle-Giraud story, and a good deal more.As regards French West Africa, he asked me a good deal about Boisson, butI found he was not familiar with any of the economic details, and I thought itwas much better not to try and put across our particular proposals. I gave thePresident a picture of all we weie doing in West Africa, which obviouslyinterested him, and explained how production, supply and shipping could onlywork as it was working here by having decisions taken on the spot.I then went on to say how all West Africa and Central Africa, naturally and economically, linked up. I did emphasise the importance of having a UnitedStates representative here who was in his confidence, and who would cover allthe questions in which we were mutually interested.I told the President how&apos; well the Naval-Air negotiations had gone and emphasised the importance of our operations from Fishermaits Lake andRobertsfield.The President talked to me a great deal about Colonial policy and colonial development, and that gave me the chance of telling him a lot about our colonial policy and practice in West and East Africa. He said one of the difficulties they found in their Colonies was that, even when they trained natives in agriculture,they did not want to stop on the land. This led me to tell him of Makerere, andthe school for the Sons of Chiefs, where they got a thoroughly practical training,and how to make the best of local agriculture to live on and off their holdings, andwent back to their villages to apply this knowledge. He asked me, rather naively,whether we had just started this, and was obviously surprised when I told him that it was a going concern when I wms there as Colonial Secretaryeleven years ago.The President obviously takes a great personal interest in these Colonialquestions and said how important he felt it was that we should work on themtogether. He was pleased, with what was being done in the West Indies in thisrespect. He said that he hoped very much that I would go to Washington andmeet his people who were working on Colonial problems, and have more personaltalk with him. He said he knew I should be tied up here at present, but hepressed me to let him know when I could make a visit, as he very much wantedme to come. I, of course, accepted, and I am sure you will not think I amtrying to usurp the position of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.One rather interesting thing he said incidentally was that he hoped weshould not give Indo-China back to the French. Chiang Kai-shek did not want,it, and he would like to see it run by a United States, British. Chinese and? French Committee.When we were talking about our common interest in Colonial problems i made it plain that all my experience was that executive responsibility for a given territory must be in a single hand. I do not think he dissents from this.I think the &quot; parent State &quot; idea would be quite agreeable to him.When I was saying good-bye, Harry Elopkins said it had been a first-classtalk. It certainly was extraordinarily interesting. Roosevelt is amazinglyacquisitive of information, and I am awfully glad to have had the opportunitvof meeting him.&quot;   ....
