THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1943.SECRET. Copy No,W.P. (43) 58.February 11, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.The Beveridge Plan.INTERIM REPORT OF THE  COMMITTEE  ON RECONSTRUCTIONPRIORITIES.Introductory.AT their meeting on the 14th January, 1943 (W.M. (43) 8th Conclusions,Minute 3), the War Cabinet decided that consideration of the Beveridge Plan,together with the general review of other substantial claims to financialassistance set out in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Paper (R.P. (43) 5), shouldbe remitted to a Committee to be constituted as follows : Lord President of the Council [Chairman);Minister of Labour and National Service;Minister of Production;Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security;Chancellor of the Exchequer;Lord Privy Seal;Minister without Portfolio;and to sit with other Ministers concerned.2. The Government&apos;s decisions on the proposals in the Beveridge Reportmust clearly be taken in the light of a full appreciation of the financial implications-tions.  We therefore deal first with the general financial position.3. We have studied two Memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,surveying the post-war Budgetary position (R.P. (43) 5 and P.R. (43) 8), togetherwith a Memorandum by the Home Secretary on the same subject (P.R. (43) 2).The Chancellor&apos;s survey shows that, looking forward to the time when expenditureon the war and its immediate aftermath has come to an end (say, in the third year after hostilities have ceased), we can see no prospect that the excess of revenue(on broadly the present level of taxation) over expenditure will suffice to meet allthe many claims envisaged, for new development on the one hand and for remission of taxation on the other. Some order of priorities must therefore be establishedbefore new commitments are entered into. At the present&apos; time the extent ofmany of the new claims likely to be made on the Exchequer after the war is stilluncertain, since in some spheres post-war plans have--not been fully formulated,,whilst in others the position will remain uncertain until after the war. At thisstage, therefore, we can say no more as regards the new claims than that we aresatisfied that the expenditure necessary to ensure international security musthave the first place, and that, second only to this, we would put the expenditurenecessary to establish trade and industry in this country on a healthy footing, tomaintain employment at the highest attainable level and to foster our exporttrade.[25024]
4. As regards the other claims on the Exchequer for additional expenditure for example, Agriculture, Education, Colonial Development and theSocial Services, to name only a few it is impossible at this stage to establishany order of priority or to enter into definite commitments. It follows that, whileit is the duty of the Government to reach provisional decisions as to post-warplans in all these spheres, these plans must all be brought under review and related to the financial situation when the time is reached for them to be put intolegislative effect.5. This does not mean that in next week&apos;s Debate the government spokesman should refrain from expressing views on the proposals in the beveridge Plan. The original intention had been that, in this initial Debate,Members of all Parties should have, an opportunity of expressing their views onthe Plan before any conclusions were reached by the Government. But some considerable time has elapsed since the publication of the Report, which has aroused a keen public interest. We think it would be difficult now for theGovernment Spokesman to say no more than that the Government still have theReport under consideration and will take into account the.views expressed.6. We recommend that the Government Spokesman should make the proviso that no firm commitments can be entered into at the present time.Subject to this, however, he should indicate the Governments general views andpreferences as regards the Report as outlined in later paragraphs. Thus, itshould be stated that the Government accept the three assumptions on which thePlan is based, viz.. Children&apos;s iVllowances, a Comprehensive National health service and the Maintenance of Employment. As regards the specific proposals in the scheme, the Government could state that they are disposed to accept certain of them in principle; that there are some which do not commend themselves tothe Government; and that others require further examination. In these lattercases the Government Spokesman should put before the House the main considerations which must be taken into account, and thus attempt to guideopinion to an understanding of them.A statement on these lines would be consistent with the terms of theResolution which has been put down.7. We deal first with the three assumptions on which the Beveridge plan is based, namely : (a) Children&apos;s Allowances.(b) A Comprehensive Health Service.(c) The Maintenance of Employment.Children&apos;s Allowances.8. Sir William Beveridge proposes that an allowance of 8*&apos;. a week shouldbe paid for each child in a family after the first. These allowances would benon-contributory.9. For some time past, there has been a widespread demand for the intro-duction of children&apos;s allowances, and we are satisfied that the principle is onewhich the Government should accept. We also agree that the allowances shouldbe paid to each child in a family after the first, and that they should be of universal application i.e., they should be paid in respect of all families, withoutany income limit.10. Sir William Beveridge reaches the figui&apos;e of 8s. by assuming 9s. as thecost of maintaining a child at subsistence level and by deducting Is. in respectof services provided in kind. Our view is that the amount of the allowance shouldbe 5s., but that, concurrently, every effort should be made to supplement this allowance by developing to the maximum practicable extent our child welfare services. The Departments concerned are examining how far these services canappropriately be carried.11. We recommend that, in the forthcoming Debate, the government spokesman should indicate that the Government favour a scheme of children&apos;allowances and consider that the amount of the allowance should be 5s. and thatit should be paid for each child after the first in every family. It should be addedthat, concurrently, every effort will be made to supplement the allowance by developing our child welfare services; and the opportunity should be taken to-stress the extent to which such services have been provided during the present war, and the considerable benefit to the health of school children which hasaccrued therefrom.
A Comprehensive Health Service.12. Sir William Bevericlge assumes a comprehensive Health Service. this service would be comprehensive in the sense that it would cover the whole range of preventive and curative treatment. It would also be of universal application;that is to say, although part of the cost of the scheme might be met by contributions, every citizen would be entitled to whatever medical treatment he might require without contribution conditions in any individual case.13. This assumption involves a vast problem of organisation which liesoutside the scope of the Beveridge Report. The form of the organisation of the health services has for long been under consideration by the Health departments and by the medical profession. It seems clear, not only that far-reaching changes are called for in the way of an integration of existing services, but also that opinion in the medical profession has moved fast in recent years and is readjfor such changes. Furthermore, it would be of immense advantage if such changescould be introduced at a time when the thousands of doctors now in the services will be returning to civil life and making a fresh start.14. We are satisfied that the time has come when steps should be taken toset up a comprehensive Health Service covering all forms of preventive andcurative treatment. We therefore recommend that it should be stated in theforthcoming Debate that the Government accept in principle the project ofestablishing a Health Service which will be comprehensive in scope and universalin that its services will be available to all members of the community. It should,however, be made clear that the establishment of such a Service will not automatically bring to an end the system of private medical practice; and thatthe voluntary hospitals would continue to play their part in the hospital systemo f the country. :15. The details of such a Service must, of course, be worked out inconsultation with the medical profession and the local authorities and other organisations concerned; and it is not possible at this stage to forecast exactly what form it will take. A warning should be given that, owing to the shortageof dentists, ophthalmologists, &amp;c, it will be many years before the full range of services contemplated in the Beveridge Plan could be provided. The FlealthDepartments will, however, open discussions at once with representatives of themedical profession and other interests affected.Maintenance of Employment.16. Sir William Beveridge assumes &quot;maintenance of employment,&quot; butpoints out that this does not mean complete abolition of unemployment. Indeed,in framing the social security budget, he assumes an average rate of unemploy-ment of about 10 per cent, of the classes at present insured. Thus, theassumption in the Beveridge Plan is, in fact, that mass unemployment such asresults from extreme cyclical trade depressions and long-lasting structuraldislocations, will be avoided.17. There may well be a danger of a high rate of unemployment for a short period of dislocation following the cessation of hostilities. But, during the twoor three years after the war, the problems to be faced, are likely to be, not so much the finding of employment there will be plenty of work to be done but rather the direction of effort and investment into the right channels.18. The longer term prospects of maintaining full employment are inevitablya matter of opinion. But much more is now known of the causes of cyclicalunemployment, and there is every reason to hope that, given a measure of inter-national co-operation and stable conditions at home, we shall be successful inavoiding its worst manifestations.19: It may be added that a sound scheme of social security might well, bycreating conditions under which measures can more easily be taken for increasino-the flexibility and mobility of labour, constitute a substantial contribution towardsthe maintenance of employment.20.   We accordingly recommend that it should be stated in the Debate that,whilst the validity of this assumption cannot be demonstrated, and whilst no one could confidently affirm that this problem will be completely solved, the Govern-ment intend to make every effort to achieve and maintain a high level of[25024] B 2
employment. In their opinion the level of employment will have a more fundamental effect than any other single factor on the post-war national income,the steady increase of which is a condition precedent to our ability to finance socialimprovements.Fundamentals of the Beveridge Plan.21. Speaking in broad general terms and avoiding technicalities, the beveridge Report is-presented as a plan for the abolition of want throughout thecommunity. As part of this scheme, the Plan proposed a flat rate of benefit duringinterruptions of earnings from all causes (subject to certain exceptions in the caseof Workmen&apos;s Compensation). It is also proposed that this rate, which wouldbe paid irrespective of the means or resources of the recipient, should be basedon standards of subsistence, assessed on an objective basis. It is also an essential feature of the scheme that contributions are levied on the whole community andthat the benefits are open to all.22. In considering whether the plan should be adopted, we must therefore consider the three following questions :  (1) Should the scheme be of universal application ?(2) Should the same rate of benefit be payable in respect of all causes ofinterruption of earnings, and should this rate be a subsistence rate ?(3) What should be the relationship between contributions and benefits ?Universality of Insurance.23. Under the Beveridge Plan, all citizens, apart from those below workingage and those retired above working age who will be beneficiaries, will be insuredagainst the main hazards of sickness, accident, unemployment, old age and death.We are in favour of making insurance under the Plan universal in the above sense,and of announcing our acceptance of this principleRates of Benefit.24. In view of the general attitude which we recommend should be taken as regards the financial aspects of the Beveridge Plan, we regard it asinappropriate to take decisions as to any of the rates of benefit or rates of contribution proposed. The only exception is in the case of Children&apos;allowances (see paragraph 10), which are not so much a part of the insurancescheme as a condition precedent thereto.25. In these circumstances we have not thought it necessary to reach adecision on the principle set out in the Beveridge Report that the rates of benefit should be sufficient to provide, without further resources, the minimum incomerequired for subsistence in all normal cases. In the case of Pensions our views as set out in paragraphs 33 to 36 do, however, imply the rejection of this principle in that part of the field. As regards sickness and unemployment of shortduration, we are agreed that there would be advantage in making the rate thesame in both cases, and we recommend an announcement to this effect. for sickness and unemployment of prolonged duration, however, it may be necessaryto introduce special provisions in view of the obvious risk of abuse (see paragraphs 29-32 and 37-38).26. It should be pointed out that it is difficult to maintain that any flat rateof benefit relates to a subsistence level when regard is paid to the wide variation of rents between different areas of the country and even in the same area. Inpractice it would be necessary to assume a reasonable average figure for rent andto deal with higher rents by adjustments appropriate to the circumstances ofeach case.27. We think further consideration should be given to the question whether there should be a dependants&apos; allowance as a part of benefit for the first childin respect of whom, under our proposal in paragraphs 9-11, no children&apos;allowance will be payable.Contributions.28. Under the Beveridge Plan Children&apos;s Allowances are non-contributory.An actuarial contribution, appropriately divided between the worker, the employer and the Exchequer is calculated for each of the insurance benefits.&apos; The
balance of the amount which the worker and employer are assumed to be ableto pay over their share of the actuarial contribution&apos; is taken as a contributionto the Comprehensive Health Service. We do not think it necessary at this stao-eto discuss what the contribution should be, but we are in favour of announcingour acceptance of the principle that the scheme should be contributory and thatthe rate of contribution should be closely related to the amount of benefitUnemployment.Proposal for Compulsory&apos; Training after Long Period of Unemployment.The Incentive to Work.29. Sir William Beveridge proposes that the period of unconditionalunemployment benefit should be six months, subject to certain adjustments, andthat, thereafter, unemployed persons should continue to be able to drawunemployment benefit at the full rate subject to attendance, as required, at awork or training centre.30. We agree that schemes of training are of the utmost importance in preventing unemployment and in securing fluidity of labour, and that all practicable steps should be taken to develop schemes to this end. On the otherhand, we are satisfied that a requirement calling upon persons to undergo training,after a certain period of unemployment, would not constitute an effective safe-guard against abuse in a system whereby unemployment benefit was paid forindefinite periods. Moreover, such a provision would militate against the effectiveness of voluntary training as a means of ensuring flexibility of labour.31. We believe, therefore, that some limitation must be placed on the period for which unemployment benefit is paid. We do not, however, consider it desirableto specify at present what this period should be. Indeed, it might be appropriate to introduce some elasticity into these arrangements so as to avoid unemploymentbenefit terminating automatically at the end of a given period, irrespective ofthe general state of trade.32. Nevertheless, we believe it to be essential that the public should receiveearly warning of the fact that arrangements, which may tend to be stigmatisedas reminiscent of the Means Test, will be necessary to avoid the abuse of the ratesof benefit and provisions contemplated in this scheme. We therefore recommendthat the Government Spokesman in the forthcoming Debate should make a clear and positive statement to the effect that it will be vitally necessary to introducesome system which will provide a strong check against abuses.(The corresponding position in regard to sickness is dealt with in para-graphs 37 and 38.)Old Age Pensions.33. The ultimate cost of the scheme of old age pensions recommended bySir William Beveridge is the most formidable element in his Plan from thefinancial point of view. The cost of old age pensions, in relation to that of allother forms of social insurance, must inevitably increase on account of the largeprospective increase in the proportion of people of pensionable age in the popula-tion as a whole. The tables printed on page 91 of the Beveridge Report show that,unless present population trends undergo some radical change, the cost ofmaintaining in old age the non-productive element in the population will imposein the years ahead a heavy and increasing strain on the productive sections of thecommunity.34. The cost in 1965 of the Beveridge Scheme for old age pensions wouldbe  300 millions a year. But, while contributions appropriate to the full rate ofpensions would begin to be payable immediately after the introduction of thescheme, pensions at the full rates would not be.reached for twenty years.35. In our view, the scheme of old age pensions recommended in the beveridge Report must be rejected on the double ground (i) that it would not be acceptable to public opinion^ in view of the largedisparity between the rates of pensions payable&apos; at the beginning andat the end of this transitional period; and(ii) that it would be unjustifiable to commit future Governments to the verylarge expenditure involved in the later stages of the scheme.[25024] B 3
We believe that public feeling in favour of generous treatment for old people will have to be met by the adoption of an alternative scheme providing for alarger immediate increase in the existing rates of old age pensions than isprovided for in the Beveridge plan; and that, given such an increase, the questionof promising still higher rates in the more distant future, to which there is very strong objection, Would not arise.36. We suggest that in the forthcoming Debate the Government should takethe line that they must reject the scheme of old age pensions proposed bySir William Beveridge for the reasons indicated in paragraph 35 above. Itshould, however, be stated that the Government are prepared to consider whatincrease should be made in the existing pension rates; and that, while no figurescan be given at this stage, it is contemplated that any increases which it may befound practicable to make would take the form of fixed, and not increasing, ratesand would become the effective rates immediately upon the introduction of thenew scheme. It should be made clear that the Government reject Sir william beveridge&apos;s proposal that the rates for old age pensions should be the same asthose for unemployment and sickness benefit. The Government would, however,propose to incorporate in any new scheme Sir William Beveridge&apos;s proposals that pensions should be conditional on retirement from work, and that personselecting to continue at work after reaching the minimum pensionable age shouldreceive an appropriate increment in respect of each year worked after reachingthat age.Invalidity.37. The difficulty of controlling a continuing disability benefit of substantial amount is likely to be increased if, as we propose in paragraph 31. unemploy-ment insurance benefit is limited in duration. There would be grave difficultyin avoiding abuse under a system whereby disability benefit was payable at thefull rate, however long the claimant remained sick.38. We consider that a clear warning should be given that some meanswill have to be found of checking such abuses probably by providing that,where a person is not likely to recover his earning capacity, disability benefit will be replaced by an invalidity allowance at the pension rate, i.e., in effect a premature old age pension. It might be difficult to defend a provision by whichthis transfer was made automatically after an arbitrary period of disabilitybenefit, and the detailed arrangements would require further consideration.Workmen&apos;s Compensation.39. The proposal in the Beveridge Report is that workmen&apos;s compensation should be unified with, and become part of, the general social insurance scheme,but with the following two exceptions :  (1) That in cases lasting more than 13 weeks the workman should be entitled,in lieu of ordinary benefit (other than children&apos;s allowances), to adisability pension equal to two-thirds of his earnings (or, in the caseof partial&apos; incapacity, a proportionate amount), up to a maximum of  3.   There would also be an industrial death grant.(2) That in any industry with risks above the normal the employer should pay a special levy equal to two-thirds of the excess costs.40. The first point is whether workmen &apos;s compensation should beincluded in the contributory insurance scheme instead of remaining a liability of the employer. It is generally accepted that the present workmen&apos;s compensa-tion system requires revision. Its inclusion in the general social securityscheme would have the advantage that it would serve to diminish friction between employers and workmen to which the present system gives rise. Itwould also, of course, do away with the difficulties of demarcation betweenaccidents and sickness.41. On the other hand, it is argued that the inclusion of workmen&apos;compensation in a contributory insurance scheme, by releasing employers fromtheir liability, would remove what some consider to be a powerful incentive tosafety In particular it would relieve employers of their incentive to find workfor their employees in cases of permanent disability. It is also argued that it is unreasonable that workmen should be asked to make any contribution towards thecost of industrial accidents.
42. It has been suggested, as an alternative, that workmen&apos;s compensation should be excluded from the proposed Social Security Scheme : but that, insteadof continuing, to be the liability of individual employers, it should be financed bylevies spread over the whole body of employers in all industries. It is clear,however, that before any scheme on these lines could be adopted, the whole questionof workmen&apos;s compensation would have to be the subject of special investigation.There is also the consideration that, if the Government were to decide thatworkmen&apos;s compensation should remain outside the Social Security plan, thiswould lend support to those who argue that unemployment insurance shouldlikewise be excluded from the Social Security plan, as being a risk to whichdifferent sections of the community are liable in widely differing degrees.43. If workmen&apos;s compensation is brought into the scheme, two other questions arise. The first is whether, assuming unification with the general security scheme, there should be (as proposed by Sir William Beveridge)differential treatment for cases of industrial disability lasting more than a certainperiod. This proposal reintroduces after the end of that period the principle onwhich workmen&apos;s compensation is now assessed and is designed to meet thedifficulties which would arise if that principle were completely abandoned. It isat variance, however, with the principle in the Beveridge Plan that the samerates of benefit should be given for the same contribution. Moreover, it has alsothe disadvantage that it would be likely to have substantial repercussions on warpensions.44. The second point arising from the proposal in the Beveridge Plan is whether there should be a special levy on hazardous industries. The principalobjection to this proposal is that it would fall to be borne by industries some ofwhich have high labour costs and are engaged in the export trade. On the otherhand, it can be argued that the high rate of risk involved in hazardous industriesrepresents an element in the cost of production which should properly be reflected in the price of their products; and it would not be easy to defend a systemwhereby part of this cost would be borne by industries (not all of which areprosperous) with lower risks.45. This subject is complex and requires further examination. Moreover,it is one on which the debate in the House is likely to prove instructive. Werecommend that the Government Spokesman in the forthcoming debate shouldcontent himself with explaining the arguments for and against the proposalsconcerning workmen&apos;s compensation in the Beveridge Plan, and noting the views expressed.Approved Societies.46. The Beveridge Report reaches the conclusion that, assuming the unification-tion of all forms of social insurance, there is no justification for the retention of approved Societies as independent financial units. At the same time, however,Sir William puts forward the tentative proposal that these societies should beemployed as agents for administering disability benefit under the unified scheme.47. We are satisfied that the first conclusion is inescapable. The growinginequality of benefits granted by the different societies is, in our opinion, in itself a sufficient justification for this view. Moreover, the increase in the scale of benefits proposed under the Plan would tend to emphasise this inequality stillfurther.48. We share the view that Approved Societies should, if possible, beemployed as responsible agents for the administration of disability benefit totheir members. There are, however, a number of points which will require furtherconsideration before it can be decided whether this is practicable.49. We are advised that the Approved Societies would themselves welcome an early statement on the subject of the Governments intentions in regard totheir future. We accordingly recommend that the Government Spokesman inthe forthcoming Debate should state that the continued existence of the approved societies as independent financial units is clearly incompatible with the basicconception of a comprehensive social security plan; that the extent to which itmight be possible to make use of the services of the Approved Societies within the framework of a comprehensive scheme was examined in a tentative way in the-Beveridge Report; and that the Government are ready to give further considera-tion to this possibility.
Death Benefit and Industrial Assurance.50. We are in favour of accepting the proposal that death benefit should be one of the benefits under the unified scheme of social insurance (the amount, andthe transitional arrangements desirable in view of existing insurances, being reserved for further consideration). We recommend the rejection of the tentativerecommendation in the Beveridge Report that industrial assurance as a wholeshould be converted into a public service under an Industrial Assurance Board.We think that both these decisions might well be announced in the forthcoming debate.51. We record our opinion that the institution of a death benefit does not give a valid claim for compensation to either the agents or the shareholders of theinsurance institutions.Widows&apos; Benefits.52. Sir William Beveridge proposes that widows under the age of 60 shouldreceive benefit at the rate of 36s. a week for 13 weeks, and that thereafter theyshould be eligible, so long as there are dependent children, for gTiardian benefitat the rate of 24s., subject to reduction for earnings, and subsequently only fortraining benefit.53. We consider that, while the existing scheme of widows&apos; pensions may beopen to criticism in respect of the payment of pensions to relatively young widowswithout children, the Beveridge proposal will be regarded as unduly harsh. we accordingly recommend that it should be stated in the forthcoming Debate thatthe Government will wish to give further consideration to this matter in the lightof the views expressed in the Debate.Administration.54.   We are agreed (1) That the administration of the insurance side of the entire social security scheme should be consolidated in one organisation, whichmight take the form of a Board, the constitutional position of whichwould be analogous to that of the Assistance Board.(2) That this step should take place after the necessary legislation has been passed through Parliament, and that, if at all possible, this should bedone by means of a single Bill.(3) That in the meantime the detailed working out of the scheme, inaccordance with decisions of principle to be taken by the War Cabinet,should be remitted to the Committee of Officials under the Chairman-ship of Sir Thomas Phillips. This work would be carried out underthe general supervision of the Minister without Portfolio.We think that, if necessary, an announcement in general terms on the above lines might be made in the forthcoming Debate. Care should, however, be takento make it clear that the Government are not committed to the establishment ofa new Ministry for this purpose.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.55.   Our recommendations may be summarised as follows: (i) General. We indicate in paragraph 6 the general line which werecommend that the Government Spokesman should take in theforthcoming Debate about the Social Security scheme as a whole,and, in particular, its financial implications, having regard to other demands on our resources.(ii) Children&apos;s Allowances. It should be stated in the Debate that theGovernment favour a scheme of children&apos;s allowances, and considerthat the amount of the allowances should be 5s. for each childafter the first; and that concurrently every effort would be madeto supplement the allowance by developing our child welfare services(paragraph 11).
(iii) Comprehensive Health Service.-It should be stated in the debate that the Government accept in principle the project of establishing a health service, comprehensive in scope and available to all membersof the community. Negotiations with the interests concerned willbe begun at once (paragraphs 14 and 15).(iv) We indicate the line to be taken in the Debate on the Maintenanceof Employment (paragraph 20).(v) Universality. We recommend announcement of our acceptance ofthe principle that the scheme of insurance should be of universalapplication (paragraph 23).(vi) Rates of Benefit. We are in favour of making the rate of benefit the same for sickness and unemployment of short duration, and recommend an announcement to this effect. We do not regard itas appropriate to take decisions at this juncture as to the rates of benefits under the scheme, except in the case of children&apos;s allowances(paragraphs 24-27).(vii) Contributions. We favour announcing our acceptance of theprinciple that the scheme should be contributory, and that the rateof contribution should be closely related to the amount of benefit;but we do not think it necessary to discuss at this stage what therates of contribution should be (paragraph 28).(viii) Unemployment. A requirement calling upon persons to undergotraining after a certain period of unemployment does not constitute an effective safeguard against abuse in a system wherebyunemployment benefit is paid for indefinite periods. We recommendthat some limitation should be&apos;placed on the period for whichunemployment benefit is paid, but we are not in a position to say what that period should be. It should be stated in the Debate thatit will be vitally necessary to introduce some system to providea strong check against abuses of unemployment benefit(paragraphs 29-32).(ix) Old Age Pensions. We recommend that the Government shouldtake the line in the Debate that they must reject the scheme of old age pensions proposed by Sir William Beveridge. It should be stated that the Government are prepared to consider what increases should be made in existing pension rates. These increases wouldtake the form of fixed rates, and not rates on a rising scale. while no figure can be mentioned at this stage, it should be indicated thatthe Government propose to incorporate in any new scheme the beveridge proposal that pensions should be conditional on retire-ment from work, and that persons electing to continue at work afterreaching the minimum pensionable age should receive an appropriateincrement in respect of each year worked after reaching that age(paragraph 36).(x) Invalidity. A clear warning should be given in the Debate thatsome means will have to be found of checking the abuse of disabilitybenefit, e.g., by providing that, where a person is not likely to recover his earning capacity, disability benefit wnll be replaced byan invalidity allowance at the pension rate (paragraph 38).(xi) Workmen&apos;s Compensation. The Government Spokesman  should explain  the arguments for and against the proposals  in the beveridge Report, and should note the views expressed(paragraph 45).(xii) Approved    Societies. We   recommend   that the    government spokesman should  state  that  the  continued existence  of  theAppiwed Societies as independent financial units is clearlyincompatible with the basic conception of a comprehensive social* i i rm r i i &apos;        r . ^Approved Societies within the framework of a comprehensive scheme (paragraph 49).security plan. Theconsideration  to  thefurtherof  the
(xiii) Death Benefit. We recommend an announcement in the Debate thatDeath Benefit should be one of the benefits under the unified schemeof Social Insurance (the amount and transitional arrangements being reserved), but that it is not proposed to convert industrialinsurance as a whole into a Public Service under an industrial assurance Board (paragraph 50).(xiv) Widows&apos; Pensions.-We think that the Beveridge proposals will beregarded as unduly harsh, and recommend that it should be statedin the Debate that the Government wish to give furtherconsideration to this matter in the light of the views expressed(paragraph 53).(xv) Administration. We suggest the lines on which an announcementmight be made (paragraph 54).On behalf of the Committee :J. A. (Chairman).Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,February 11, 1943.
