WE submit herewith the Eighth Report* of Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd&apos;sCommittee on the Enemy Oil Position. The Report, which takes into accountinter alia a recent report on the German oil position received from the RussianCommissariat of Foreign Trade, contains a comprehensive review of the develop-ments in the oil position from the outbreak of the war to the present day.2. We are in agreement with the conclusions of the Committee, which areas follows :  (a) The German oil position is at the present time at a crucial stage, and the securing of Caucasus oil must become a primary factor in Germanstrategy.(b) The destruction of the oil resources of the Northern Caucasus, if theycannot be retained, is of the greatest importance.(c) The retention in Allied hands of the oil resources in the SouthernCaucasus is of the greatest importance.(d) Any action which will compel the maximum consumption of oil by the axis Powers during the ensuing months, or will effectively deny themsubstantial quantities of their existing stocks or substantially reduce their sources of supply in German Europe, will be of great strategicvalue.3. With reference to Caucasian oil (Conclusion 2 (a), (b) and (c) above), our ambassador at Kuibyshev has reported that on the 21st November he consideredthat the time had come to sound the Soviet Government as to the employment ofBritish experts to assist in the planning of oil demolition and to convey to them the assurances! as to oil supplies, which His Majesty&apos;s Government had authorised him to do if he felt that circumstances rendered it essential. the ambassador took this action in consultation with his United States colleague,who also gave similar assurances to the Soviet Government.4. The Soviet Government has accepted our offer to send oil demolitionexperts to the Caucasus area, and the mission is now on its way.5. The Soviet Government has also expressed satisfaction with the declara-tion concerning oil supplies, and has suggested that a determination of theseconditions should form the subject of an agreement between the two Governments* P.O.G. (41) 21 (annexed).f W.P. (41) 224, Annex IV.[23245]
we are not clear what the Soviet Government has in mind in making this request,for we consider it hardly feasible in present circumstances to define futureconditions with any precision, and that a formal agreement could as yet do littlemore than reproduce the text of assurances already given. Our Ambassador inRussia has accordingly been invited to suggest to the Soviet Government that asa first step preliminary discussions should take place between the respective oilexperts; this, we hope, will show the points on which the Russians desire to define the conditions.6. As to the oil resources in Southern Caucasus (conclusion (c)), weconsider their retention in Allied hands as of the greatest importance sincedestructive measures could hardly be sufficiently drastic to prevent the enemy fromobtaining sufficient oil from this area to be of considerable value to him.7. With reference to the last conclusion of the Committee, it is not possibleto predict what will be the effect of denying to the enemy any particular quantityof oil. It appears probable, however, that Germany will, in any case, begin the spring campaign with low oil stocks, so that damage done to her stocks and supplies during the next 4 months is likely to be of particular significance.8. In this connexion we recall that, after considering our Report* in June,in which we recommended that heavy bombing attacks should be made on Germansynthetic oil plants, the Defence Committee invited the Air Ministry to arrangefor a heavy attack to be delivered as soon as weather conditions permitted. Upto date, such an attack has not been made, owing, we believe, to adverse weather conditions.On behalf of the Committee :(Signed) HANKEY, Chairman.Great George Street, S.W.1,December 15. 1941.* W.P.

COMMITTEE ON THE ENEMY OIL POSITION.Eighth Report.WE appointed a Sub-Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir HaroldHartley to review the developments in the oil position from the outbreak of warin September 1939 to the present day. We now attach their report (without the appendices), together with three graphs depicting the estimates..2. So far as the period September 1939 to the outbreak of the Russian Waris concerned, we do not consider it necessary to enter into a detailed comparison of the estimates in this new report with those in our latest reports. We prefer to concentrate on the outstanding feature on the previous and present reviews(also inherent in the Russian review*), namely, the almost exact correspondenceof the estimates of reserves at the disposal of the Axis Powers at the crucialmoment of the attack upon Russia. These reserves are put at 5-5J million tonsand we propose to examine the developments in the situation from this point ofcommon agreement.3. The estimates of the Sub-Committee for the 4 months immediately following the 1st July, 1941, differ widely from those of the Russian report, butagree substantially with the previous estimates of our Committee. Thecorresponding figures are as follows : Hartley Our 7th Report RussianReport. (Revised).^       Report.(a) Stocks at the outbreak of (In thousands of tons)the Russian Campaign      5,000-5,500 5,016 5,365(b) Average   monthly   with-drawal    from    stocks(July to October 1941) 400 360 1,1104. The Russian figure for stock withdrawals assumes that Roumanianproduction has been reduced by 25 per cent, as the result of Russian bombing,and also that 20 per cent, of oil consumed on the Eastern Front has been destroyedas the result of Russian action. The first assumption we know to be incorrect,and the second we have deliberately ignored on the ground that any destructionby the Russians of German stocks may well have been offset by captures by theGermans of Russian oil stocks. If these two items are excluded, the Russianestimate of monthly withdrawals is reduced from 1 -1 to about f miillion tons amonth. The difference between this latter figure and the estimate of about 400,000tons given by our Sub-Committee is entirely due to the higher Russian estimateof consumption on the Eastern Front, which our expert advisers regard as an over-statement.5. According to the position set forth in the report of our Sub-Committee,the development from the outbreak of the Russian war may be summarisedapproximately as follows :- (jn thousands of tons.)Stocks on 1st July, 1941   ...............      5,000-5,500Excess of consumption over intake from 1st July to31st October, 1941      ............... 1,5003,500-4,000Estimated draft on stocks in November ...      ...      ... 300Balance on 1st December, 1941 .........      3,200-3,700Stocks immobilised in process and in transit    ...       ... 1,400Stocks available for civil and military requirements,including quantities necessary to maintain efficientlocal distribution       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      1,800-2,300* P.O.G. (L) (41) 9, also P.O.G. (41) 20.f A revised estimate was given in the report of the Sub-Committee on the service estimates, circulated as P.O.G. (L) (41) 8, also P.O.G. (41) 14.
6. In our last Report, it had been estimated that 2-8 million tons of oilwere immobilised. This consisted of the 1-4 million tons in transit and in process,to which reference is made above, and a further equal quantity of oil requiredto maintain efficient local distribution. In the opinion of the Sub-Committee,the Germans, in the case of emergency, would be able to make extensive inroadsinto this second category of stocks, but long before the available stocks on the1st December were completely exhausted, local famines would occur in parts ofGerman Europe. The Sub-Committee, however, has not made an estimate of thepoint at which this development will begin to occur.7. It is clearly of the greatest importance in estimating the enemy&apos;s oil position that we should assess as closely as possible the point beyond which anyfurther withdrawal from their serviceable stocks would affect the provision of essential supplies to the armed forces, industry and transport. Apart from oilimmobilised in transit and in process, we previously estimated that 1 - 4 million tons of all products would be necessary to maintain an adequate distribution overthe whole of Europe dominated by the Axis. Any figure put forward in this context must admit of a certain latitude, but, after further consideration, we see no cause to doubt the reasonableness of our previous estimate, and that afterstocks begin to fall below about 2 - 8 millions, the complicated system of distribution over Europe must begin to break down.8. If Germany can obtain control of the Northern Caucasian oil-fieldsMaikop and Grozny, before the winter, but is unable to penetrate into SouthernCaucasian and capture the Baku fields, she will find herself in possession ofsources of oil production estimated at the present time at about 5 million tonsa year. Effective Russian sabotage, including the &quot; junking &quot; of all wells wouldprobably reduce this output to about half a million tons during the first 6 monthsof operations, and, in that event, no material relief would be derived immediatelyfrom these sources.9. As regards Roumania, the latest reports indicate that Germany&apos;s efforts to increase crude production have met with little success. The present rate of output does not exceed the average of 1940; probably no material relief can beexpected from this source.10. No account has been taken of civil consumption of oil in German-occupied Russia. The peace-time consumption of the territory now occupied bythe Germans was about 500,000 tons a month, and it would seem that certainquantities of oil must be made available to this area, even if Germany intends to do no more than salvage from the ruins of the occupied territory the goodsnecessary for her war effort.11. Any forecast of the position over the next few months is obscured byunknown factors, both as regards the present stock position and as regards therate or continuance of future decline. The stock position is affected both by the margin of uncertainty regarding the stocks at the opening of the campaign (a margin which may be wider than the 500,000 tons which we have shown in paras. 3and 5), and by our ignorance of the amount of captured stocks in Russia; we have assumed that these are offset by enemy stocks destroyed, but they may, in fact,represent a net gain. Future decline in stocks is dependent on the degree ofmilitary activity during the winter; on the extent to which civilian consumption in German Europe is further reduced; on the extent of the demand represented by occupied Russia, for which, as mentioned above, we have made no allowance;and on the extent to which supplies can be further increased. There are possi-bilities of a limited increase from the relatively small production of the RussianPolish fields, and from the further expansion of synthetic production and substitute fuels.12. Since it is difficult to estimate these developments in advance, we proposeto submit a brief review of them month by month as they occur. We are ofopinion, however, that unless static conditions are restored on the Eastern front and further steps are taken to reduce consumption and increase supply, theenemy&apos;s oil position will continue to deteriorate during the winter months.
13. In the concluding paragraphs of their report, the Sub-Committee dealas follows with the evidence on oil shortage available from Intelligence reports : &quot; Evidence from such sources showed that, in the earlier periods ofthe war, motor transport, both in Germany and in occupied countries, wasbeing restricted to essential uses, and that substitute fuels were being usedto an increasing extent. During recent months, however, there have beennumerous reports showing that greater efforts are now being made to limit the civil use of motor transport as much as possible and to increase the generaluse of substitute fuels. There have also been a number of reports thatGermany has drawn heavily on her oil reserves during the Russian campaign,and there is some evidence of actual oil shortages, particularly in occupied countries. There is, therefore, a growing amount of information in supportof the general findings of the report.&quot;A selection of Intelligence reports during recent months was made by theSub-Committee and is now reproduced by us in the attached Appendix withsome further additions.While we agree that the estimates of the position at the present time find some corroboration in the cumulative effect of Intelligence reports, we feel that,though the number of these reports, both general and particular, is increasing,they are not yet such as to prove that those far-reaching and drastic steps havebeen taken which would be a sure indication that Germany regarded her reservesas inadequate for her strategic needs.14. Our study of the position at the present time leads to the following conclusions : (1) The German oil position is at the present time at a crucial stage, andthe securing of Caucasus oil must become a primary factor in Germanstrategy.(2) The destruction of the oil resources of the Northern Caucasus, if theycannot be retained, is of the greatest importance.(3) The retention in Allied hands of the oil resources in the SouthernCaucasus is of the greatest importance.(4) Any action which will compel the maximum consumption of oil bythe Axis Powers during the ensuing months, or will effectivelydeny them substantial quantities of their existing stocks or substan-tially reduce their sources of supply in German Europe, will be ofgreat strategic value.
COMMITTEE ON THE ENEMY OIL POSITION.Report from Sir Harold Hartley&apos;s Sub-Committee.November 1941.This review of the German oil position takes the form of 5 Reports whichare attached* as Appendices II to V and the conclusions of which are consoli-dated in Appendix I.  The reports referred to deal with the following subjects : 1. The German stock position at the outbreak of war.2. Civilian and industrial consumption in German Europe since the outbreakof war.3. Consumption by the enemy armed forces since the outbreak of war.4. A statement which has been prepared by a technical committee under theChairmanship of Colonel Auld, showing the estimated production inGermany and occupied territories.Included in these figures is an estimate of stocks obtained in Italyand occupied countries.It can be seen from Appendix I that during the period the 1st September,1939, to the 1st July, 1941, consumption in Axis Europe was almost exactlyequivalent to intake, i.e., production, imports, contraband leakage and stocksacquired in all occupied countries, including Italy, France and Roumania. Thus,on the 1st July, 1941, stocks, in Axis Europe were the same as those in GreaterGermany alone on the 1st September, 1939, Le., between 5 and 5% million tons.During the four months from July to October it is estimated that enemyconsumption has exceeded production by about 1,500,000 tons, involving a witli-drawal from stocks at the rate of about 400,000 tons a month. Thus, on the1st November it is estimated that German-controlled stocks were reduced to between 3-^ and 4 million tons.The whole of this oil cannot be considered available for consumption. a detailed study has been made of the quantity of oil in German-occupied europe which must always be immobilised in process and in transit. The amount of oil in transit will vary with the length of the enemy lines of communication, and thedemand occasioned by the nature of his activities. The present estimate of oil in process is 550,000 tons, and oil in transit 850,000 tons, giving a total of1,400,000 tons. The stocks available to Germany on the 1st November were therefore between 2,100,000 and 2,600,000 tons.In previous reports the volume of stocks estimated to be &quot; immobilised &quot; wasgiven at 2,800,000 tons. This was made up of about 1,400,000 tons in process and transit and 1,400,000 tons estimated as necessary to maintain efficient localdistribution. It is thought that a more accurate picture of the German oil position will be given if only the 1-4 million tons actually in process and transitis deducted when arriving at a figure of &quot; available stocks.&quot; It must then beremembered that long before the &quot; available &quot; stocks are exhausted industrialeffectiveness will be impaired by local oil famines resulting from difficulties in distribution.We have taken no account of civil consumption of oil in German-occupiedRussia. The peace-time consumption of that part of Russia now occupied by theGermans was about half a million tons a, month. It would seem that, if germany is to gain any economic advantage from her conquest, she must spend oil to doit, and the pre-war Russian consumption was in the main strictly utilitarian.Intelligence about German economic action and intentions in occupied Russia isstill scanty and uncertain, and it is not felt that any numerical estimate of whatoil she may have to spend would be helpful. It remains a debit item of which no account has been taken.* The appendices are not reproduced here, but can, if desired, be obtained from the WarCabinet Offices.
Germany&apos;s future oil position will depend upon the following factors : (1) The degree of contraction in military consumption between the 1st november and the opening of the spring campaign.The naval and air force estimates are expected to remain the same.  The armyestimate covers two possibilities, and is as follows : (a) It is assumed that the whole eastern front is static during the winter.The saving in consumption will then be 300,000 tons per month,provided that the troops withdrawn are not actively employedelsewhere.(b) It is assumed that the northern two-thirds of the eastern front will bestatic, and the southern front will remain active throughout thewinter. The saving in consumption will then be 200,000 tons per month, provided that the troops withdrawn from the northerntwo-thirds of the front are not actively employed elsewhere.(2) Forced contraction in civil and industrial consumption.The new estimate of current consumption assumes that full industrial output for war purposes is maintained in Germany, and that the allowance to occupied countries could not be reduced without a reduction in the contribution which thesecountries are making to the German war effort. As the requirements of the armed forces must undoubtedly have priority over all other requirements, one cannot rule out of account the possibility that Germany will deliberately curtail supplies, andthus reduce the efficiency of her essential war industries in order to ensure thather armies have sufficient supplies for a spring campaign.Until early in 1941 the Germans did not seriously undertake the developmentof the use of producer gas as an alternative fuel. It is estimated that the numberof generators on motor vehicles alone increased during 1941 from 20,000 to120,000, producing a saving of 260,000 tons of oil a year, and a further expansionof this programme is known to be in hand. Substantial economics in oil consump-tion may be expected from this source.(3) Expanding production of crude oil and synthetic and substitute fuels.Destruction in the oilfields of Russian Poland is believed to have been slight.A small production can be expected in 1941, and in 1942 some 400,000 tons of crude oil will be added to Germany&apos;s supplies from this source.There has been a steady expansion of synthetic production in Germany since1937. The increase to be expected in 1942 over 1941 production is about330,000 tons.During 1942 Germany could, if pressed, obtain substantial relief by the useof Methyl and Ethyl alcohol. The former entails the use of additional surplussynthetic ammonia capacity, and supplies from this source could be increased from the rate of 600,000 tons of motor spirit equivalent which has been allowed for the last 6 months of 1941 to 1,000,000 tons during 1942.In 1941 the quantity of Ethyl alcohol which was available in occupiedEurope as automotive fuel amounted to 642,000 tons. It is estimated that in 1942this could be increased to at least 1,848,000 tons if (a) 80 per cent, of the available sugar-beet molasses, instead of 50 per cent, asat present, were used for alcohol.(b) the edible sugar allocation for Germany, Italy, Poland and Czecho-slovakia were reduced by 25 per cent, of the present rate of consumption, which is still the same as pre-war. This would reducethe sugar rations of these countries to approximately the existingrate in France and Belgium.(c) 30 per cent, of the 1941 vintage and of all stocks of wine were distilled inall countries except Germany, and 20 per cent, of the current produc-tion and stocks of Potable Spirits were also distilled.No intelligence is available of the quantities of Ethyl and Methyl alcohol atpresent being used, and although it is known that wine and sugar are being
withdrawn from human consumption, and are probably intended for alcoholdistillation, there is no evidence of Germany&apos;s intention to increase her supplies from these sources by as much as the 135,000 tons a month forecast for 1942. this figure should therefore be taken only as an indication of maximum potentialsupply.The maximum possible increase from all these sources seems to be abmn200,000 tons a month for the full year. c(4) A acquisition of Russian oil-fields by the Germans.If Germany can obtain control of the North and Trans-Caucasian oilfieldswith the wells, refineries and transport facilities in reasonable working order heroil problem is solved. This, however, depends on the effectiveness of defence and destruction. Germany&apos;s first and easiest objectives are the Maikop and Groznyfields, which have a present annual production of about 5,000,000 tons. Ifdestruction, including cementing up of wells, is effective, Germany is unlikely toobtain more than 600,000 tons of oil during the first 6 months of occupation. Thecomplete destruction of the refineries in the Maikop and Grozny areas would prevent her from making immediate use of this oil, as it would have to be trans-ported to Europe for refining.(5) Extent and effectiveness of Allied Interference.Sources of Information.In preparing this report the following methods have been used :  1. Wherever possible, use has been made of Intelligence reports from one ofthe following categories :  (a) Definite statistics, e.g., consumption in Norway and Denmark,movements of oil from Roumania, actual consumption in occupied and unoccupied France in May 1941. This informa-tion is derived from neutrals who have recently been in thecountries concerned, escaped nationals, secret service reports,and intercepts.(b) Published decrees regarding restrictions in Axis Europe, andany other published information, such as the Von Schell speech at the Leipzig Fair, which gave figures of conversions of petrol and diesel engines to producer gas.(c) Reports received from secret sources, giving no precise figures butindicating general trends.2. Considerable use has been made of statistical data relating to pre-warGermany, and the inferences which have been drawn from this sourcehave been fully discussed with the oil companies and other experts inthe light of their pre-war experience of German conditions.Examples of this procedure may be found in the Appendix on Germanoil stocks at the beginning of the war and in that part of the Appendixon intake into German Europe since the outbreak of war which dealswith the production of crude oil and synthetic and substitute fuels.3. In cases where Intelligence is not available and pre-war statistics givelittle guide to the present Axis postion, use has been made of compar-able figures in this country, e.g., in the report on civil consumption inGermany. *4. In the case of service estimates, the figures are based on Intelligenceregarding the enemy&apos;s activity and, where necessary on the knownrates of consumption by the British Armed Forces under comparableconditions.Evidence of Oil Shortage from Intelligence Reports.Any estimate of this kind that is not based wholly on ascertained figuresmust be liable to a considerable margin of error, and it is therefore importantknow to what extent its results are confirmed by Intelligence reports.   Evident
from such sources showed that in the earlier periods of the war motor transport,both in Germany and in occupied countries, was being restricted to essential usesand that substitute fuels were being used to an increasing extent.During recent months, however, there have been numerous reports showing that greater efforts are now being made to limit the civil use of motor transport as much as possible and to increase the general use of substitute fuels. Therehave also been a number of reports that Germany has drawn heavily on her oilreserves during the Russian campaign, and there is some evidence of actual oilshortages, particularly in occupied countries. There is, therefore, a growingamount of information in support of the general findings of the report.
Selection of Intelligence Reports.(The approximate dates when reports were received are shown in parenthesis.)Restriction on Oil Consumption.Germany.In November 1939 an order was issued by the Reich Ministry of Transportthat the consumption of petrol must be reduced to 15 per cent, of normal. Theuse of motor cars for private purposes was forbidden.   (January 1940.)2. The use of taxis was limited to doctors, nurses, strangers with heavyluggage and sick persons, or to cases of special licence under Police authority.The ration was reduced to 1^ gallons a day. A number of cases had been reportedagainst motorists for using cars for pleasure purposes.   (April 1940.)3. Mr. Berthoud quoted a report from a German petroleum expert to theeffect that the number of civilian cars in Germany had been reduced to 20 per cent,of pre-war figures. Only small cars with a capacity of 2 litres or less were allowed,so that the petrol consumption was probably only about 15 per cent, of the pre-warfigure.   (May 1940.)4. The restriction on the use of motor cars had been tightened. No taxiswere available in Berlin and East Prussia. These stringent restrictions in forcein East Prussia and Berlin were extended to the Nazi party and Army and government officials. The number of cars in use by the General Staff had beenreduced by 75 per cent.; even doctors were only allowed 9 gallons a month.(July 1940.)5. A prisoner-of-war who was an oil controller in East Prussia stated thatthroughout Germany no private cars above 2-J litres were allowed to be usedexcept by higher Nazi officials. In East Prussia, petrol was reserved for militaryservice requirements. Road vehicles ran on butane, which was issued only for urgent business needs. It was stated that butane was used extensively in germany for lorries and private cars, and that producer gas had been rarely used. Petrolwas diluted with ethyl alcohol, even for military purposes. Only 10 per cent, ofthe taxis were allowed to run. 60-70 per cent, of private cars were laid up in* East Prussia. There were no dangers of shortage of petrol for military purposes,but there was a definite shortage of diesel oil.   (May 1941.)6. The Reich Chief of Police issued orders recently restricting taxiservices to the police area in which they were registered. It was forbidden touse them during the day time for any purpose for which other conveyanceexisted.   (May 1941.)7. In East Prussia, road transport was prohibited except where it wasimpossible to use train or boat. Then it was only allowed if return freightswere available.   Still further restrictions on taxis were reported.   (July 1941.)8. It was reported that a transport firm received gas in cylinders and sufficient supplies of motor spirit, including synthetic spirit. Supplies of dieseloil were meagre and were lower than all other stocks. Only 60 per cent, of thequantity supplied at the beginning of the year was allowed. The radius of activity of lorries without special permits had been reduced from 50 to 10 km.(July 1941.)The same firm was reported to have received sufficient petrol up to June 1941to cover its requirements. 50 per cent, only of the normal figure was received in.July, and only 30 per cent, in August and September. The September allowance was fully used up by the middle of that month.   (September 1941.)9. The petrol allowance for individuals who had so far been allowed to usecars was reduced by 50 per cent, from the 1st October, 1941. Motor cyclistsreceived one gallon per month, instead of two. (October 1941.) The ration fortaxis in Berlin was said to be less than 20 gallons per month. The same newswas received from another source, and it was pointed out that there were, in anycase, very few privileged persons with authority to use cars.   (October 1941.)
10. A British Consular official, returned from internment in the Rhinelandrreported that petrol for motor cars was scarcer than ever. No private cars were allowed in the area except a very few acting as delivery vans.  (October 1941.)11. Early in July retail dealers were advised by the authorities that theywould henceforth receive only 85 per cent, of the quantity of gas oil to which thecoupons from their customers would otherwise have entitled them. operators of large and medium passenger cars permitted for business or professionalpurposes were ordered to replace them with light-weight cars. If these smallercars were not available on the market, the authorities proposed to requisitionlight cars laid up through lack of licence.   (November 1941.)12. A source who was in Berlin in the middle of October reported that avery strict order had been issued restricting the use of petrol for cleaning dirtyengine and aircraft parts. Some special products were to be provided for thispurpose.   (November 1941.)13. A director of a large oil concern in a neutral country stated that thepetrol consumption in Germany in mid-October 1941, exclusive of oil used by thearmy in the field, is about 70 per cent, of pre-war consumption.France.1. An oil manager returned from France gave the monthly consumption of oil products in the occupied zone as 34,000 tons and in the unoccupied zone29,000 tons, plus 14,000 tons of bunkers.   (March 1941.)2. There was an almost total lack of all types of automobile fuel in France.(September 1941.)3. The distribution of petrol in France was reported to have increased for mines working in the metallurgical industries. Mines working directly for theGermans were in no way limited, and obtained the quantities of petrol askedfor. Report added that it must be remembered that both petrol and fuel or gasoil are synthetic products manufactured by the Germans. On the other^hand,the lubricating oil question was acute.   (October 1941.)4. Passenger services have been further restricted on the French railways,partly owing to the shortage of lubricants.   (October 1941.)5. One of the chief problems in connexion with the present French harvestis the fact that the majority of threshing machines were, operated by petrol, andare consequently lying idle through lack of fuel.   (October 1941.)Italy.1. Additional stringent measures were ordered for the restriction of the useof motor spirit. It was forbidden to use any type of automobile on Sundays orholidays. This order covered the vehicles running on substitute fuels also. for those cars which were permitted to run, the ration of motor spirit was reduced inMay to 2^ gallons per month for 10-h.p. cars and 5 gallons for 11- to 15-h.p. cars.The number of taxis was still further restricted in June. There were strongindications of the continued conversion of merchant shipping from oil to coal.(July 1941.)2. It was reported by a leading oil expert returned from Italy that stocksof oil at the end of 1940 were probably under 1 million tons. Another experfsreport stated that stocks of fuel oil were severely restricted and there was aprobable shortage of certain grades of lubricating oils. There was also a drivefor the return of used lubricating oils for regeneration.3, It was reported that the Ministry of Corporations had decreed that allretail coupons for spirit for private cars would be cancelled on the 1st October,as all available petrol was reserved for the armed forces. After that date onlycars using substitute fuels would be allowed to operate.    (July 1941.)Holland.Petrol stocks were reserved for doctors, and omnibuses in Amsterdam had to operate on producer gas as far as possible   (August 1941.)
Denmark.1. Oil stocks were very low and 2,500 tons a month were being imported,from Germany.   (February 1941.)2. There were further reports of an absence of petrol for lorries. Theunsuitability of producer gas as fuel for heavy traction work was also mentioned.Fishermen were receiving about 15 per cent, of normal requirements of fuel oil(July 1941.)Belgium.1. Very few cars were in circulation; all those over 14-h.p. were prohibited.There was a shortage of lubricating oil and grease, and issues were curtailed even for vehicles using gas generators. A reliable report gave the consumption of petrol as only 10 per cent, of normal.   (April 1941.)2. The shortage of lubricating oil was causing difficulty on railways(June 1941.)Substitute Fuels.Germany.I. Omnibuses were running mostly on compressed gas or producer gas.(April 1940.)2. A decree had been issued that all lorries with loads of 5 tons and overwere to be converted at once to the use of protane and butane. Then lorries oflighter loads were to be converted until all were completed.   (April 1940.)/ 3. A report from Berne stated that 2\ million cubic metres of sewage gaswas used as motor fuel by the town of Stuttgart, mainly on municipal services.(November 1940.)4. A Berlin paper mentioned that stationary diesel motors consuming lessthan 12 tons of fuel per annum had to convert to solid or gas fuel.   (April 1941.)5. General von Schell stated that the number of vehicles in October 1940operating on bottled gas was 60,000 and on producer gas 14,000.   (June 1941.)6. According to General von Schell, 180,000 lorries in Germany and occupied countries were using substitute fuels, saving 648,000 tons of petrolannually.   (July 1941.)7. A very large proportion of military motor transport were operated bylorries which did not use petrol. Many of the lorries used methane gas, saving120,000 tons of petrol annually.   (July 1941.)8. The press reported that tests had been made of generator gas, and, owingto the shortage of timber, hard coal would be used as fuel. Supplies of this were stated to be adequate at production centres, but transport difficulties would nodoubt arise.   (September 1941.)9. A director of an industrial concern stated that the authorities werecontinually sending instructions for his firm&apos;s vehicles to be converted to operate on wood gas. Although, generators had been on order since the beginning ofJuly, none were available.   (September 1941.)10. Steps would be taken in the near future to ensure the greater use ofwood gas for ships and barges on internal waterways.   (November 1941.)II. Military tractors used for towing aircraft on a large Berlin aerodromewere said now to be equipped with cylinders. This was not the case even a fewweeks previously.   (November 1941.)France.1. Supplies in both zones were very limited, and extensive use was beingmade of alcohol from wines.   (July 1941.)2. A grave scarcity of wood for gas generators is reported. It was estimated that by May 1941 57,000 vehicles had been converted to producer gas.(August 1941.)
Italy.The use of methane as a substitute fuel was stated to have made greatprogress. About one-third of the taxis and omnibuses in Rome were usingmethane as a fuel. It was stated officially that 20,000 motor cars and 2,000omnibuses had been adapted to run on methane, which was also used by nearly all of the 7,000 rail oars.   (April 1941.)Holland.1. Gas generators were being constructed in large quantities, but harvestingwas being held back for lack of motor fuel.   (August 1940.)2. About 5,000 vehicles, including 1,800 lorries, were running on producergas; this is about 5 per cent, of the total number running in 1939.   (June 1941.)Denmark.1. At the end of April about 9,200 lorries out of 43,000 pre-war were running on producer gas. All German lorries in Denmark were said to be fitted with generators. Owing to the lack of wood, attention was being paid to thedevelopment of peat fuel.   (August 1941.)Norway.1. At the end of January 1941 about 3,000 vehicles were using wood fuel and 1.000 were using carbide. The State was encouraging the use of substitutefuels and helping farmers to purchase generators for their tractors. It had also provided money to equip 100 fishing vessels with generators.   (June 1941.)2. About 8,000 vehicles were operated on producer gas at the end of july and 14,000 were expected to be in use by the end of 1941.   (August 1941.)General.1. In August reports were received that withdrawals had been made frommain petrol reserves at Starnberg, near Munich, and that stocks in the Viennaarea had been reduced by 500,000 tons.  (August 1941.)2. A Director of Boschwerke (Stuttgart) reported that the authorities had instructed them to convert their source of power from diesel motors to waterturbines in order to save fuel. He also stated that this order was due tothe severe strain on the oil supplies as a result of the Russian Campaign.(August 1941.)3. The owners of three or four Swedish motor vessels were persuaded by theGermans to enter the ore trade, by promise of oil fuel, but by the end of the monththere was evidently a change in German policy because the owners were informedthat they could no longer count on obtaining bunker fuel from German ports, andthe ships were withdrawn.   (September 1941.)4. Professor Brogle, Director of Basle Samples Fair, was reliably reportedto have seen a secret German report that oil supplies in Germany were sufficient for eight months.  The date of the secret report is not known.   (September 1941.)5. A source who is considered reliable stated that he was told by a directorof a large international oil company in Germany that at the present rate of consumption of petroleum Germany&apos;s reserves would be exhausted by the middleof 1942.   (September 1941.)6. Mr. W. L. Shirer, an American journalist who was in Berlin (1934r-41),wrote as at December 1940 &quot; Civilian consumption of oil has been reduced toalmost nothing. No private cars and practically no delivery trucks are allowedto operate. Oil is prohibited for heating purposes. When the war started,Germany had large stocks of oil on hand, and she obtained quite a windfall in norway, Holland and Belgium.&quot; He gave synthetic petrol production at theend of 1940 at the rate of 4 million tons per annum. His guess was that germany had enough oil or could get enough oil to satisfy her military requirements for atleast two more years, i.e. to end of 1942.7. An American journalist who was in Berlin from June 1940 to June 1941stated that anxiety about German petroleum position was evident and it may
not be realised to what extent consumption by industrial and public transport had been reduced. This, together with the effect of air attacks on sea-borne traffic,had thrown an immense burden on German railways and canals.8. An excellent source reported he had heard through the German economic mission in Paris that since the beginning of the Russian campaign the germans have been drawing on their reserves of petroleum products at the rate of 500.000tons a month.   (October 1941.)9. According to reports from Vichy, German fuel reserves have been seriously eaten into.   (October 1941.)10. A high Swedish official who had for a long time previously deniedreports of oil shortage in Germany, stated that he had received most reliable information that, for the first time during this war, the German military machinewas definitely experiencing difficulties owing to oil shortage. The german military machine is now using over 2 million tons per month, whereas productiondid not exceed 14^ millions per annum.   (October 1941.)11. An assistant director of the French Institute of Liquid Fuel, head office in Paris, commented on the Axis oil position in early August and again late inSeptember.In August he said the Germans&apos; stock of gasoline was 3,000,000 tons, andthat in the first month of the Russian campaign they had captured enough gasolineto carry on the campaign for two months without drawing on their reserves.In September he said that German gas oil and lubricating oil stocks werebeing dangerously depleted, but it would be all right when they had reorganisedRoumania and the Caucasus.12. A neutral of some standing, who had recently been at board meetingsattended by directors of the Reichsbank and Pirellis, stated that, providedGermany does not obtain Caucasus oil, she will be facing a shortage in about ayear. With the Caucasus supplies, she need not fear a shortage. The weakpoint in her present oil position is lubricants.   (November 1941.)13. A source in Italy, said to be well placed with official connexions, has stated that every month that passes in active fighting costs the Axis between1 -6 and 1-8 million tons of oil.   (November 1941.)14. According to an officer of a friendly Legation who is in close touch withthe Roumanian Minister of National Economy, the German Economic Missionhas assured the latter that German production of synthetic motor spirit has nowbeen so increased as to be almost sufficient for the conduct of the Russiancampaign, and that, as a consequence, it was possible to store all the oil now beingshipped from Roumania to Germany. This informant, however, said that hewas highly sceptical of this assertion, particularly in view of the continuedeagerness of the German buyers to obtain every drop of Roumanian oil available,and he estimated that German consumption of motor spirit in the Russiancampaign must amount to at least one million tons per mensem, whereas the synthetic production of Germany was not, in all probability, in excess of 4 million tons annually.
