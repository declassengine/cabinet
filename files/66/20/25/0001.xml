THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  December 1941.MOST SECRET. Copy No.   gCjW.P. (41) 302.December 19, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ALLIED CO-ORDINATION.Memorandum prepared in the War Cabinet Offices.1. THE object of this paper, which has been prepared in consultation withthe Departments principally concerned, is to present a factual statement of the stage which had been reached in Inter-Allied Co-ordination at the time of theoutbreak of war with Japan.A. Co-ordination of Higher Direction.2. Since France went out of the war, the method used has been that of personal telegrams exchanged between the Executive Heads of the powers concerned, namely, the Prime Minister, President Roosevelt, M. Stalin, and nowGeneral Chiang Kai-shek. There has only been one meeting on the lines of a supreme War Council the Atlantic Conference between the Prime Ministerand President Roosevelt and their various Advisers. In addition, there have beena number of special visits such as those of Mr. Plopkins to this country and russia, and of Lord Beaverbrook to the United States of America and Russia.Mention should also be made of President roosevelt&apos;s practice of appointing hisown special representatives e.g., Mr. Harriman in London, Mr. Bullitt in theMiddle East, and Mr. Currie in China.3. Political and economic questions have been dealt with at inter-AlJiedmeetings held in St. James&apos;s Palace. Two such meetings have been held up to thepresent time, but no formal procedure or machinery for these gatherings has been set up. It had been decided to keep the arrangements as flexible as possible, inview of the probable extension of the war.B. Military Co-ordination.I. ^United Kingdom-United States.(a) Washington Staff Conversations.4. Military co-operation has hitherto been closest between the belligerentBritish Empire and the non-belligerent United States.5. In January-March 1941, Staff Conversations were held between a UnitedStates Staff Committee and a United Kingdom Staff Delegation, with whichwere associated representatives of Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Thepurposes of this Conference were : &apos;&apos; (a) To determine the best methods by which the Armed Forces of the Unii&amp;dStates and British Commonwealth, with its present Allies, wol liddefeat Germany and the Powers allied with her, should the UnitedStates be compelled to resort to war.[23268] B
2&quot;.(6) To co-ordinate, on broad lines, plans for the employment of the forces\ of the Associated Powers.r &quot; (c) To reach agreements concerning the methods and nature of military.co-operation between the two nations, including the allocation of the k- principal areas of responsibility, the major lines of the militarystrategy to be pursued by both nations, the strength of the forcesr. which each may be able to commit, and the determination of satis-i factory command arrangements, both as to supreme Military controland as to unity of field command in case of strategical or tacticaljoint operations.&quot;6. The Conference covered all this wide field. It reached agreement,amongst other things, on the broad strategic object of the two nations, theirstrategic defence policy and joint strategic concept; and it produced a &quot;JointBasic War Plan.&quot; But, for the purposes of this paper, the most importantconclusions were as follows : (i) Agreement was reached on the division of probable theatres of war intoa number of areas in each of which one of the two Powers should assume responsibility for the strategic direction of both its own forces and those of the other Power,(ii) Agreement was also reached on certain principles of operationalcommand within such areas, the most important principle being thatthe forces of either Power employed under the strategical directionof the other should normally be used as &quot; task &quot; forces i.e., that theyshould be charged with specific strategic tasks and operate under their own Commanders.(iii) It was agreed to exchange Military Missions with the following-functions : (a) To represent jointly, as a corporate body, their own Chiefs ofStaff vis-a-vis the Chiefs of Staff of the Power to which theyare accredited for the purpose of collaboration in the formu-lation of Military policies and plans governing the conduct ofthe war in areas in which that Power assumes responsibilityfor strategic direction.(b) In their individual capacity to represent their own individualMilitary services vis-a-vis the appropriate Military services ofthe Power to which they are accredited in matters of mutualconcern in the areas in which that Power assumes responsi-bility for strategic direction.(iv) It was agreed that existing Military intelligence organisations should operate as independent agencies, but there was provision for closeliaison both through the Military Missions and also between allechelons of command in the field.(v) The Conference recommended the establishment at the earliest possible moment of some method of procedure to ensure the allocation ofMilitary material both prior to and after the entry of the UnitedStates into the war in the manner best suited to meet the demand ofthe Military situation.(b) Subsequent developments.7. There have been the following main developments since the WashingtonStaff Conversations. In so far as they have been disappointing this is largely due to the preoccupation of United States Staffs on supply and manpower as opposed to strategical questions :  (a) Nucleus Military Missions have been exchanged (British Joint Staffi Mission in Washington and United  States Observer Group  inl London).   Through these Missions there has been a certain amountof exchange of information and co-ordination on the &quot;planning&quot;level but much more in London than in Washington, where thei&apos; tendency has been to call the British Joint Staff Mission into consulta-tion only where this has been unavoidable. Very close touch ismaintained between the British Joint Staff Mission in washington and the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand Service Attachesthere.
(b) There were further Military conversations at the Atlantic Conference.These were concerned mainly with procedure for the allocation ofUnited States war material, and in this respect were largely abortive.(c) Allocation of United States war material has, in the first instance, beendictated by the United States Staffs. The Joint Staff Mission hasbeen given opportunities to discuss these allocations; and special cases have been fought out through various channels on both the Serviceand the. political planes. But, broadly speaking, no system of agreedallocation on a strategical basis has yet been established.(d) Representatives of the  United States  War Department have beenappointed for liaison with Commander-in-Chief, India (GeneralWheeler, covering India, Persia and Iraq) and Commander-in-Chief,Middle East (General Maxwell). Their principal duty is to make recommendations regarding constructive &quot; tasks &quot; to be undertaken&quot;by the United States in those areas and to supervise their execution.(e) Agreement has been reached on a list of liaison officers to be exchanged between various British and United States Commands, and a numberhave already been appointed.II.-U.K.-U.S.S.R.-U.S.A.8. There has been an exchange of Military Missions between the UnitedKingdom and the U.S.S.R. Up to the present, however, the reluctance of theRussians to give information about their resources or their strategic situation orplans has been a hindrance to real co-ordination or joint planning.9. Similarly, at the Moscow Supplies Conference, discussion centred on Russian requirements and the extent to which the United States of America andthe United Kingdom were able and prepared to meet them.III.- U.K.-U.S.A .-China.10. The United Kingdom and the United States of America have for some-time maintained Military Missions at Chungking. Their function has been largely advisory and instructional and there has been little strategical discussion between the three Powers.Since the outbreak of war between the U.K., the U.S.A. and Japan,arrangements have been made for adequate military representation at general Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Headquarters.IV. Far Eastern Conferences.11. There have been three series of Military Conversations in the far east: (i) United Kingdom, Australia and Netherlands.(ii) United Kingdom and Netherlands (to deal with certain points leftunsettled at (i)).(iii) United Kingdom, United States of America, Netherlands.12. These conversations were all concerned with Military preparations and plans for the conduct of a possible war in this one area and need not, therefore,detain us. The military agreements reached under (i) and (ii) above have sinceproved their worth. That reached under (iii) was never approved by the UnitedStates Chiefs of Staff or Government and events have overtaken it.V. U.S.A.-Canada, and U.S.A.-South America.13. Separate strategical discussions have been held between the UnitedStates of America and Canada and between the United States of America and various South American Republics. We have not got full knowledge of the resultsof these discussions which have related solely to the Defence of the western hemisphere. The discussions between Canada and the U.S.A. were held throughthe medium of the U.S.-Canadian Joint Defence Board which is alwaysavailable as a means of U.S.-Canadian Military collaboration.[23268] b 2
Q,.-Economic Co-ordination.14. When considering present inter-allied relationships in the economic-sphere, the position is so dominated by the United States that it is necessary toset out separately the arrangements at present in force for liaison between theUnited States and the British Empire and also.to give a fairly full description of the various agencies which have been formed by the United States Governmentto deal with economic and production problems. Unfortunately, the fact that an agency has been set up to perform a certain function, does not necessarily mean that there is the administrative organisation necessary to carry that function out.United States Organisation.15. Since the passing of the Lend/Lease Act, the United States ProcurementDepartments have had not only to place orders and process their own largeprogrammes, but also perform a similar function for all countries obtaining aidunder Lend/Lease terms. This means they have to purchase and deliver not onlyarmaments, but a large variety of raw materials, food, oil and semi-manufacturedgoods. In order to do this a vast expansion of the procurement departments wasnecessary and a number of agencies were created to deal with the economic,production and priority problems involved.16.   The procurement departments are as follows : A rmy.(a) Army aircraft, aircraft engines and components.(b) Ordnance,: tanks and other military motor vehicles, miscellaneousmilitary supplies, components and explosives.Navy.(,a) Naval ships and supplies and naval aircraft.(6) Oil.Maritime Commission.Shipbuilding.A griculture.Food and feeding stuffs, cotton and tobacco, resin and other agricultural produce.Treasury.Other raw materials and semi-finished and finished manufactured goods,including certain ancillary stores such as transportation and engineering stores.17. All these departments have formed Divisions of Defence Aid which areresponsible for the processing of Lend/Lease requisitions and for liaisonarrangements with the countries receiving Lend/Lease aid. In the case of theUnited Kingdom, there are a number of Joint Aid Committees on which UnitedStates and United Kingdom representatives sit.18. Over and above the Divisions of Defence Aid, there is the Office of lend/Lease Administration (Stettinius), known as OLLA, which is responsiblefor seeing that the countries receiving Lend/Lease supplies comply with the termsof the Bill and any subsidiary agreements, such as the White Paper of the10th September.   It also deals with questions of eligibility.19. The most important of the United States Government Agencies whichhave been formed in order to deal with production and priority problems are :  (1) S.P.A.B.   The Supply Priorities and Allocation Board.    ChairmanMr. Wallace.   Executive Officer Mr. Nelson.(2) O.P.M.     The    Office    of    Production    Management.      ChairmanMr. Knudsen.(3) The Economic Defence Board.   Chairman Mr. Wallace.20. S.P.A.B.&apos;s job is to control priorities and allocate material. O.P.M.&apos;sjob is to plan production of munitions and raw materials and the use of man-power. (It should be noted that Mr. Nelson, who is Executive Officer of S.P.A.B.,is also Priorities Director of O.P.M.)   The Economic Defence Board consists of
nearly all the important members of the United States Cabinet, with the excep-tion of Mr. Hopkins, with Mr. Milo Perkins as Executive Officer. It was formed&quot; to develop and co-ordinate policies, plans and programmes, designed to protectand strengthen the international economic relations of the United States in theinterests of national defence.&quot;21. Last, but not least, the United States Chiefs of Staff retain the right&apos;5to allocate all complete weapons of war. ..;;British Supply Organisations in the United States.22. Our Supply Organisations in the United States were formed at a timewhen we were placing our own orders and have adapted themselves to meet Lend /Lease conditions.23. The central organisation is the British Supply Council under theChairmanship of Mr. Morris Wilson, with Mr. E. P. Taylor as President and executive Officer. Membership consists of the Heads of our Purchasing Missions,the Canadian Minister of Munitions and Supply (Mr. Howe); and Mr. Monnet.24. The Supply Council is advised on strategic and military matters (asthey affect supply) by the Joint Staff Mission, and the Heads of its three con-stituent Missions are frequently in attendance at its meetings.25.   The Purchasing Missions are as follows : British Purchasing Commission : Sir Clive Baillieu.British Air Commission : Sir Henry Self.*British Merchant Shipping Mission : Sir Arthur Salter.British Food Mission : Mr. R. H. Brand.26. The Ministry of War Transports organisation under Sir AshleySparkes is directly responsible to the Ministry of War Transport. A smallNaval party under Admiral Dorling is attached to the Joint Staff Mission fordealing with Supply questions.Co-ordination.27. The Missions all have direct liaison with the Division of Defence Aidin the respective United States Procurement Departments, either through JointAid Committees or exchange of representatives. They also have direct relationswith OLLA.28. The Heads of Missions and the British Supply Council take upquestions of higher policy with Stettinius (Lend/Lease Administrator) or otherhigher Executives, as the case may be, e.g. : Sir Arthur Salter, of the Merchant Shipping Mission, would take hisproblems to Admiral Land, of the Maritime Commission, or Ickes, the OilCo-coordinator.Sir Clive Baillieu, supported by the British Army Staff Mission, wouldtackle Mr. Stimson, the Secretary for War.Mr. Brand would normally approach Mr. Wickard, the Secretary for agriculture.29. If discussions at these levels failed, the Supply Council might take upthe matter with Mr. Hopkins, who is regarded as the Presidents representative in these matters, or, alternatively, with the co-operation of 011a, approach theEconomic Defence Board, S.P.A.B. or O.P.M., as the case may be.30. The exception to this procedure is questions in connection with rawmaterials coming from outside the United States. In these cases the B.P.C. and war Trade Department of the Embassy work together their opposite number inthe United States Administration being the State Department, who in turn wouldbe acting under the general instructions of the Economic Defence Board.Dominions and Colonies.31.   The Dominions  and  India  have  their  own  Supply  Missions  in washington, and the Colonies have a Colonial Liaison Officer.   Empire warlike* Now also deals with oil (formerly handled by a separate Petroleum Mission).
stores requirements generally are handled through London, so that the require-ments from the United States dealt with direct by the Dominion and Colonialsupply representatives at Washington are mainly limited to raw materials,components and machinery. Requisitions for the Empire generally are placedthrough the United Kingdom Missions, but the Dominion and Colonial representa-tives have their liaison with the United States Procurement Departments andwith OLLA. As a result of her close relations with and proximity to the UnitedStates, Canada&apos;s contact in such matters is much closer than that of otherDominions. The Hyde Park Agreement of 1941 between the President of theUnited States and the Prime Minister of Canada established special arrange-ments for co-ordinated defence production.Supplies to A Hies from U.S.A.32. The United States Government deals directly with Russian, Chinese and Dutch requirements. Supplies to other allies, including Turkey, are requisi-tioned under Lend/Lease through British Missions and on British requisitions,and are financed out of the Appropriations available to us. The U.S.A. have leftit to us to recommend when supplies should be retransferred to Allied.Governments.33. There has been no formal consultation with the U.S. on their supplies to Russia, China or the Dutch, but in the Case of Russia we have exchanged infor-mation with them and Russian requirements have been shared out between thetwo countries according to ability to supply.Economic Warfare.34. Close co-ordination has been established with the U.S.A. both atWashington and in London, on such matters as export licensing controls, pre-emption arrangements, Black List and Proclaimed List, shipping and bunkercontrols, financial pressure and application of freezing orders, and to someextent (which we hope may be developed) on &quot; rationing &quot; neutral countries andeconomic intelligence. At Washington, the co-ordination is done through theWar Trade Department of the British Embassy, which is in daily contact withthe different United States agencies concerned. In London, the co-ordination was at first effected through a special representative of the United States Adminis-trator of Export Control, and is now done by a representative of the UnitedStates Embassy assigned for that purpose.Economic Relations with Countries other than U.S.A.35. No machinery (other than that of normal diplomatic channels) has been set up for inter-Allied consultation or joint action on economic matters generally.An inter-Allied Bureau for collating information as to immediate post-war needsunder Sir F. Leith-Ross was set up by the inter-Allied meeting in September (seeparagraph 3 above). This Bureau has begun to function. It reports to an inter-Allied Committee, which has, however, not yet met, largely owing to difficultiesmade by the Soviet Government.^ 36. There are in London bi-partite shipping committees for joint consul-tation with Allied Governments who possess merchant marines. these committees control the allocation and use of the shipping of Allied Governments.37. Mention should also be made of an informal Anglo-NetherlandsCommittee on Economic Affairs which was set up in December 1940, which has proved, useful both for co-ordinating economic warfare measures and for settlingother economic questions at issue between this country and the Dutch.38. Allied Governments discuss their military requirements with theService Departments, while their civil requirements are handled partly by private firms, who obtain the release of materials, &amp;c, from the Departments concerned,and partly direct by Departments or U.K.C.C. Questions of policy on supplies to allies (including transport) are referred to the Allied Supplies Executive,though broad strategic issues as to the scale of military supplies are reserved forthe Defence Committee.
D.-Co-ordination with the Dominions.39. Whilst this paper is mainly concerned with co-ordination between thiscountry and foreign countries who are our allies, the following notes on existingmethods of co-ordination with the Dominions would seem to complete the picture.Co-ordination in this field is secured by : (a) Communications on the highest level between the Prime Ministers ofthe United Kingdom and of the Dominions direct.(&amp;) The day-to-day (or hour-to-hour) consultation between the Dominionsand ourselves through the Dominions Office on the full range of inter-governmental business.(c) Consultation with Dominion High Commissioners in London and betweenDominion Governments and United Kingdom and Dominion high commissioners at Dominion capitals.(d) On appropriate matters direct communication between the Service staffs of the United Kingdom and Dominions.(e) Similar direct communication in certain instances between Supply andTechnical Departments of the United Kingdom and DominionGovernments.It may also be mentioned that three Dominions, viz., Australia, New zealand and the Union of South Africa, are represented on the Eastern Group supply council at Delhi.40. There are also, too, the opportunities for personal consultation providedby occasional visits by Dominion Prime Ministers and other Dominion ministers to this country, and there are special arrangements existing at present wherebyan Australian Envoy attends meetings of the War Cabinet in London when matters of particular interest to Australia are under discussion.Offices of the War Cabinet,Great George Street, S.W. 1,December 19, 1941.
