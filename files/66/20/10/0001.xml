MR.  EDEN    TO    SIR STAFFORD CRIPPS ..(KUIBYjJLHEV) .No.  188o 21st November, 1941.IMPORTANT.PERSONAL AND SECRET.My telegram No, 184 /of 21st November/aPlease convey following message from Prime Ministerto Premier Stalin./Begins/.      Many thanks for your message just received.      Atthe very beginning of the war I began a personal correspondence with President Roosevelt which has led to a very solid under-standing being established between us and has often helped in getting things done quickly.      My only desire is to work on equal terms of comradeship and confidence with you.2o      About Finland,  I was quite ready to advise theCabinet to declare war upon Finland when I sent you my telegramof 5th September.      Later information has made me think that itwill be more helpful to Russia and the common cause if the finns can be got to stop fighting and stand still or go home,than if we put them in the dock with the. guilty axis Powers b,ya formal declaration of war and make them fight it out to theend.      However if they do not stop in the next fortnight and you still wish us to declare war upon them we will certainlydo so.      I agree with you that it was very wrong anypublication should have been made.      We certainly were not responsible.3p      Should our offensive in Libya result as we hope inthe destruction of the German-Italian Army there,  it will bepossible to take a broad survey of the war as a whole with more freedom than has hitherto been open to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.4.      For this purpose we shall he willing in the nearfuture to send the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Eden, whom you know,via the Mediterranean to meet you at Moscow or elsewhere      Hewould be accompanied by high military and other experts, andwill be able to discuss every question relating to the warincluding the sending of troops not only into the Caucasus butinto the fighting line of your Armies in the south.      Neitherour shipping resources nor the communications will allow largenumbers to be employed, and even so you will have to choose between troops and supplies across Persia.5.      I notice that you wish also to discuss the post-warorganisation of peace.      Our intention is to fight the war inalliance with you and in constant consultation with you, tothe utmost of our strength and however long it lasts,  and whenthe war is won, as I am. sure it will be, we expect that SovietRussia,  Great Britain and the United States will meet at theCouncil table of the victors as the three principal partnersand agencies by which Nazism will have been destroyed.    Naturallythe first object will be to prevent Germany and particularly

Prussia breaking out upon us for a third time,      The fact that russia is a Communist State and. Britain and the United states are not and do not intend to be, is not any obstacle to ourmaking a good plan for our mutual safety and rightful interests -The Foreign Secretary will be able to discuss the whole of this field with you-60      It may well be that your defence of Moscow andLeningrad,  as well as the splendid resistance to the invaderalong tae whole Russian front,  will inflict mortal injuriesupon the internal structure of the Nazi regime^.      But we mustnot count upon such good fortune but simplyokeep. on striking atthem to the utmost with might and main,      /Ends/.M.   STALIN TO THE PRIME MINISTER,dated, KREMLIN,,23rd November?  1941-Many thanks for your message.      I sincerely welcomeyour wish as expressed in your message to Collaborate with moby way of personal correspondence based on friendship andconfidenceo      I hope this will contribute much to the successof .vur cc mmon cause *2o      On the  question of Finland the&apos; U.S.S.R0  never proposedanything else - at least in the first instance - but the cessation of the military operations raid the de facto exist off inland from the war.      If however Finland refuses to complyeven with this in the course of the short period y-au indicated,then I believe the declaration of war by Great Britain wouldbe reasonable and necessary.      Otherwise an impression may be created that there is no unity between us on the question ofwar against Hitler and his most ardent accomplices and that theaccomplices of Hitler&apos;s aggression can do their base work withimpunity.       With regard to Hungary and Roumania we can perhapswait a little while..3.      I support oy all means your proposal of an early visit to the U.S.S.R.  by the Foreign Secretary Mr. Eden,      I believecur joint consideration and acceptance of an agreement concerningthe common military operations of the Soviet and British forcesat our front as well as speedy realisation of such an agreement would have a great positive value.      It is right that considera-tion and acceptance of a plan concerning the post-warorganisation of peace should be founded upon the general  idea toprevent Germany and in the first place pr11-. -v.. once more toviolate peace and once more to plun0^ peoples into terriblecarnage.

4-      I also fully agree with you that the difference ofthe state organisation between the U.S.S.R.  on the one hand andGreat Britain and the United States of America on the otherhand should not and could not hinder us in achieving a successful solution of all the fundamental questions concerningour mutual security and our legitimate interests.      If thereare still some omissions and doubts on this score I hope theywill he cleared away in the course of the negotiations withMr. Eden.;5,      I beg to accept my congratulations on the successfulbeginning of the British offensive in Libya.6.      The struggle of the Soviet Armies against Hitler&apos;stroops remains to be tense.      In spite however of all thedifficulties the resistance of our forces grows and will grow.Our will to victory over the enemy is unbending.
