NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.Naval forces have been co-operating with the Army off the Libyan coast andhave destroyed two enemy supply ships.An Italian cruiser has probably been sunk by one of our submarines in theCentral Mediterranean.HALS. Dunedin and H.M.A.S. Sydney are presumed sunk by enemy action.A merchant raider has been destroyed in the South Atlantic.Our shipping losses have been exceptionally light.Home Waters.2. On the 23rd the fifteenth Canadian troop convoy arrived in home waters.During an attack by E-boats on a coastal convoy off Cromer on the night of23rd/24th, one E-boat was sunk, one was probably sunk and another was damaged by the escorting destroyers.Northern Waters.3. On 12th November, the Russian submarine K.21, in the vicinity ofHammerfest (westward of North Cape), torpedoed two merchant vessels of4,000/5,000 tons, one of which was sunk.Early on the 22nd, in an attack on a westbound convoy off Vardo (VarangerFjord), H.M. Submarine Seatoolf sank a 3,000-ton tanker, and on the 24th, in thesame vicinity, torpedoed another merchant ship.On the 24th, HALS. Kenya, with two British and two Russian destroyers,bombarded the enemy fort and batteries at Vardo.Mediterranean.4. Light forces have operated off the Libyan coast in support of our militaryoperations, and cruisers and destroyers have been disposed to intercept reinforce-ments by sea.The S.S. Glenroy (Special Service vessel, 9,809 tons), on passage to Tobruk,was hit by a torpedo during an attack by two torpedo-bombers, and wassubequently beached at Mersa Matruh. One certainly and possibly both attackingaircraft were shot down.H.M. Australian Sloop Paramatta was torpedoed to the north-eastward of tobruk.   Survivors have been sent to Alexandria, but no details are available.On the 10th November, the Greek submarine Glaucos torpedoed and probably sank a merchant ship of 3,000 tons off Heraklion (Crete). On the 21st the Polishsubmarine Sokul, off&apos; Navarino Bay, obtained two hits on a southbound convoy of three ships escorted by a destroyer. On the same day H.M. Submarine Utmost,in the vicinity of the Strait of Messina, attacked a force of three cruisers andthree destroyers. One cruiser was hit and probably sank. In a further attackon this force by aircraft another cruiser was hit by torpedo (see Air Section).Two schooners were sunk by H.M. Submarine 0. 21 off the north-western coast of Italy.In the afternoon of the 24th, following a report by aircraft, H.M. ShipsAurora and Penelope, with two destroyers, sank two southbound merchant ships of 5,000 tons, escorted by two destroyers, to the south-west of Crete. The escortingdestroyers escaped.It is estimated that 14,000 tons of enemy shipping has been sunk or damaged in the Mediterranean by our aircraft; details are given in the Air Section.During the week approximately 22,000 tons of French shipping westboundand 15.000 tons eastbound have passed the Straits of Gibraltar under escort.South Atlantic.5. On the 22nd H.M.S. Devonshire sank an enemy vessel, thought to be theGerman Merchant Raider Goldenfels (7,800 tons), 800 miles S.S.W. of Freetown.No survivors were picked up owing to danger from attack by U-boat.
H.M.S. Dunedin, on patrol in the Central Atlantic, has failed to answersignals for more than forty-eight hours and it is feared that she has been sunk bya U-boat.East Indies.6. H.M.S. Cornwall, to the south-east of Cape Guardafui, intercepted theFrench s.s. Surcouf (1,129 tons) north-bound with a cargo of foodstuffs.Australia.7. From the information at present available, it is understood that an action took place to the west of Cape Farquhar (West Australia) betweenH.M.A.S. Sydney and an enemy raider, resulting in both ships being sunk.German seamen survivors have been picked up in this vicinity by the Britishtanker Trocas (7,406 tons), but up to the present no survivors from Sydney havebeen found.Anti-Submarine Operations.8. During the week there have been six inconclusive attacks on U-boats,three by aircraft to the westward of Ushant, two by our surface craft in theStraits of Gibraltar and to the south-west of Freetown, and one by a Russianpatrol boat in the approaches to the White Sea.Enemy Intelligence.German,9. There is no change in the position of main units. The battleship Tirpitzshows no sign of impending activity, but the Pocket Battleship Admiral Scheerremains at immediate notice.U-boats.Reports received indicate no important changes in the disposition of U-boats in the North Atlantic. In the South Atlantic U-boats have been reported offFreetown, in the St. Helena area, and two or three in mid-Atlantic near theEquator.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.10. No casualties from U-boats or mines have been reported during theweek. Two ships were sunk and another damaged in a southbound convoy, whichwas attacked by E-boats off the Norfolk coast. Enemy aircraft damaged two ships off the East Coast and have also attacked shipping off the Wexford coast,inside territorial waters.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending the 26th November, 1,110 ships, including 244allied and 35 neutral were convoyed. Two cruisers, four anti-aircraft ships,108 destroyers (including 30 United States destroyers), and 107 sloops, corvettesand minesweepers were employed on escort duties.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 22nd November were 602,000 tons, of which 240,811 tons were oil ofvarious grades. Imports during the previous week were 606,354, and the average for the past ten weeks was 896,000 tons.British Minelaying.12. During the week mines have been laid off the Belgian Coast and offFrench Biscay Ports.[23200] n
Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. On the night of 23rd/24th, about 30 enemy aircraft laid mines in theupper Bristol Channel, which necessitated closing all ports above Swansea for two days. On the night of the 24th/25th, about 23 aircraft operated overthe Thames Estuary. Minor raids were also made off Holyhead, Milford Haven,Falmouth and Lyme Bay. Twelve magnetic and nine acoustic mines have been destroyed during the week. The mine totals are : 1,529 magnetic, 1,170 acousticand 1,063 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.14. The Yugoslav Serafi.n Topic (4,294 tons), which has been at Oran since january 1941, is reported to have been handed over to the Italians. The ItalianMauro Croce (1,049 tons) is reported to have been torpedoed on 9th Novemberwhile on passage from Barcelona to Genoa. The Italian Capo Pino (4,785 tons)is overdue at Istanbul from Salonika and is reported to have been sunk. the yugoslav Tomislav (5,387 tons), which has been taken over by Lloyd Triestino,left Shanghai on 19th November under the Italian flag.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is includedin this Resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Finland.15.   There has been no change.Leningrad Sector.16. Fierce fighting has taken place east of Leningrad in the Volkhov-Tikvin area, but there has been no appreciable change.Central Sector.17. The territorial situation in the immediate neighbourhood of Kalininremains the same, but it appears that the German forces, which were held at thispoint, have been diverted south-eastwards against Moscow. This new drive hasmade substantial progress and the Germans claim to have reached SolnechnayaGora, which is less than 40 miles from Moscow.Due west of the capital there has been no advance by the Germans againstthe vigorous Russian resistance, but the pressure is being maintained.Coincidental with the new Moscow thrust the intensified offensive immediately to the south of Tula continues, and has made some further progress in thedirection of Riazhsk.South of Orel there has been a slight advance to the Orel-Kursk railway.U kraine.18. Some slight advance has been made south-east of Kharkov in thedirection of Kupyansk.Although the Germans have reached Rostov, strong Russian resistancecontinues, and, as the town is on the right bank of the Don, its loss would have no serious immediate strategic effect, provided the bridges over the river were destroyed.Crimea.19. The whole of the Crimea is now in German hands except for the south-western extremity, where Sevastopol continues to resist strongly.Up to the present the Germans have made no attempts to cross the KerchStraits.Conclusion.20. The new offensive towards Moscow from the north-west, in conjunctionwith the maintenance of pressure due west of the city, considerably increases the
threat to the capital. The Russians, however, continue to resist vigorously andthere is no indication of any collapse before this new offensive.The eastward thrust south of Tula is also serious and, as mentioned in lastweek&apos;s Resume, may be aimed either at cutting the Moscow-Ryazan-Voronezhrailway, or, more probably, at swinging northwards against Moscow from theline Tula-Riazhsk. The result of the new offensives will largely depend on whether the improved weather conditions hold. A sudden thaw, which is probableat this time of the year, might well bring operations to a standstill.The Germans may be expected to continue their thrust in the Rostov sector,with the object of crossing the River Don as quickly as possible and then beginningtheir drive into Caucasia.Operations.Enemy Forces and Dispositions.Libya.21. Prior to the opening of the campaign enemy forces in Cyrenaica were believed to consist of (a) German Afrika Corps *15th Armoured Division ) q rm21st Armoured Division j &apos;55th Savona Infantry Division,located roughly in the area Bardia-Sollum-Sidi Omar.(b) Italian 21st Corps 17th Pavia Infantry Division,25th Bologna Infantry Division,27th Brescia Infantry Division,with a stiffening of German infantry, investing Tobruk.(c) Italian 10th Corps 132 Ariete Armoured Division,101 Trieste Motor Division,102 Trento Motor Division,in reserve in the area El Adem-El Gobi-Bir Hachim to the south of Tobruk.The German armoured divisions were on a colonial establishment and contained only one armoured regiment each (in addition to infantry regiments,supporting artillery, &amp;c). The 132 Ariete Armoured Division was thought tobe about the equivalent of a British armoured brigade. In all, it was estimatedthat the Axis disposed of some 387 tanks, apart from obsolescent and very lighttanks.The task of containing the Tobruk garrison fell in the main to italian forces, consisting of three infantry divisions and elements of one motoriseddivision. They were also responsible for the defence of outposts, such as theremote Jalo oasis, 260 miles south-west of Tobruk.3Own Forces and Plan.22.   As far as is known, General Auchinleck&apos;s intentions were (a) to bring about a tank battle, with the particular object of destroying theGerman 15th and 21st Armoured Divisions;(b) at the same time, to roll up the enemy&apos;s forces in the frontier areaSollum-Bardia-Sidi Omar from the south and south-west.To provoke the tank battle, the plan was to advance on Tobruk with cruisertank formations via Fort Maddalena and El Gobi with the object of forcing theenemy to leave his laager positions and fight in the open. The Tobruk garrisonwas to co-operate.The attack on the enemy in the frontier area was to be carried out primarily with unarmoured formations supported by &quot; I &quot; tanks.In addition, a third force was to advance from Jarabub on Jalo, in WesternCyrenaica, a distance of 180 miles.[23200] b 2
The Opening of the Offensive.23. Before the main offensive, certain preliminary operations were carriedout in the vicinity of the coast behind the enemy&apos;s lines. The results of these operations are not yet known.24. The offensive which opened at dawn on the 18th November coincided with very bad weather which prevented the bombing of enemy aerodromes on the extensive scale which had been planned. Heavy rain had fallen in Cyrenaicaand turned usually motorable areas into mud. The Western Desert railway toMersa Matruh was breached in several places, although the damage was not serious.The rainfall had, however, been much heavier on the coast than inland, and enemy communications, landing grounds and laagers were more adversely affectedthan the desert areas in which our troops had concentrated.25. The armoured portion of the force refuelled some 20 miles east of thefrontier at 0900 hours on the 18th November and proceeded to advance accordingto plan. By the late afternoon the leading brigade was 20 miles south-east of el Gobi, with the remainder of the force echeloned in rear.By midday advanced patrols of the formations detailed for the attack on theenemy in the frontier area had made contact on the general line Halfaya-Scheferzen, and, at dusk, a detachment was located between the Halfaya ridgeand the coast, the bulk of the force being in the Scheferzen area and to the south-east of it.Meanwhile the advance from Jarabub had begun.Strict wireless silence was preserved during this stage of the operations.Hitherto serious battle had not been joined, but all available evidence pointed to the fact that the enemy had not yet appreciated either the scope or weight ofthe offensive.On the morning of the 18th November an enemy force of tanks and M.T.were reported by air reconnaissance to be stuck in the mud at Bir el Gobi and werelater very successfully attacked by Blenheims and Maryland?.Operations on the ldth and 20th November.26. Reports of operations subsequent to the approach march have naturallybeen fragmentary, and it is not yet possible to give a connected story of the battle.The first clashes between armoured forces appear to have occurred on the afternoon of the 19th November, when 18 Italian tanks were destroyed nearBir el Gobi and one of our leading formations met some 60 German tanks,believed to be of the 21st Panzer Division, 20 miles to the north-west of SidiOmar. In the latter action 26 enemy tanks were destroyed and 20 of our ownwere lost.Meanwhile the formation in the centre had pushed on unopposed in thedirection of Sidi Rezegh, south-east of Tobruk.27. On the 20th November the armoured battle was joined in earnest. Theformation on the right took up the pursuit of the enemy forces with which it hadbeen engaged in the Bir el Meliba area on the previous afternoon and drove themoff in a north-easterly direction, inflicting a loss of 34 tanks and 9 tanktransporters. Meanwhile the centre formation had encountered 200 tanks ofthe 15th Panzer Division, which seem to have been trying to cut their way out to the west. In the action which developed to the south-east of Sidi Rezegh theenemy lost 70 tanks, 33 armoured cars and several hundred prisoners before with-drawing. In addition, 19 enemy aircraft, previously damaged by our fighters,were captured on Sidi Rezegh landing ground with their crews.In the centre, between Sidi Rezegh and Bir el Meliha, another Britisharmoured formation came into action against German tanks moving south-westfrom the Bardia-Gambut area.   The results of this action are still not known.28. Enemy tank casualties on the 19th and 20th November amounted in all to 130 tanks, 33 armoured cars and 9 transporters approximately half of theGerman armoured strength in Cyrenaica. -29. On the evening of the 20th November, reserves of tanks were sent upto make good the losses sustained by our armoured forces during the openingengagements.
30. While these battles were in progress, increasing pressure was beingexerted on the enemy in the Halfaya-Sidi Omar region; part of our forcesengaging the enemy in a northerly direction and part outflanking the defencesto the west, directed on Sidi Aziz, 12 miles to the south-west of Bardia.31. Throughout these two days the R.A.F. were most active and steadilygained a degree of air superiority which by the 21st November appears to have become almost complete. A marked feature of the air operations was the excellentco-operation with the armoured formations. An example of this may be quotedwhen a distress call for ammunition was made at 1230 hours on the 20th November;the ammunition was picked up from Matruh and delivered to the formationconcerned on the scene of battle four hours later.Operations on the 21st November.32. The 21st November saw a continuation of the heavy fighting. This wasto be expected after the German High Command had recovered from the shockof their original surprise. By midday a strong enemy tank force was beingengaged heavily by our armoured formations south of Sidi Rezegh. At the sametime a defensive flank was established at El Gobi to mask the Italian ArieteDivision, which had withdrawn westward after the action of the 19th November.Fighting in the Rezegh area was undoubtedly very heavy on this day and casualties to our armoured forces may have been severe. There is reason to hope, however, that the enemy force which contained the bulk of German armoured fighting vehicles remaining in Cyrenaica was very seriously depleted.33. Meanwhile the Tobruk Garrison, which had been ordered to make asortie at dawn, was making slow progress towards Sidi Rezegh.Their sally had been preceded by a successful feint attack by British and polish infantry on the western sector, intended to cover the real point of exit onthe eastern perimeter. The considerable opposition from German infantry and extensive minefields met on the eastern flank were undoubtedly the main factorscontributing to the slowing up of this advance, in which 1,100 prisoners, half ofthem German, were captured.34. Further east, part of the force in the frontier area had advanced toSidi Aziz, 10 miles west of Capuzzo and in rear of the German battalions in theCapuzzo-Halfaya area. To the south a detachment had by-passed Sidi Omar,held by the 55th Savona Division, and was planning to attack that fort on thefollowing morning from the north.In the desert the force from Jarabub was also preparing to attack Jalo.Operations on the 22nd and 23rd November.35. Accounts of the operations up to the morning of the 23rd Novemberare still somewhat disconnected.It appears that on the 22nd November the majority of the enemy tankssucceeded in extricating themselves from the engagement south of Sidi Rezeghand retiring north-eastwards behind the escarpment, covered by a screen of anti-tank weapons.Later in the day the formation holding Sidi Rezegh was attacked by astrong force of enemy tanks from the east and west and was forced to withdrawsouthwards. These tanks may have been partly those which had succeeded indisengaging themselves from the battle earlier in the day and partly Italian andGerman tanks which had been concentrated south of TobrukBy the following morning the bulk of our armoured force and the unarmouredtroops accompanying it were engaging this new enemy force south of Sidi Rezegh.The battle continued-throughout the day and casualties on both sides are believed to have been heavy.36. Few further details have been received of the sortie south-eastwardfrom Tobruk. On the 22nd November, however, the advance was continuingslowly and steadily, and several enemy strong points had been captured.37. Meanwhile, Capuzzo and Sidi Azeiz had been captured during the night 21st/22nd November, and part of the force operating in the frontier area had turned westward towards the main battle area south-east of Tobruk.
Further south the force from Jarabub had captured Aujila, 8 miles north-west of Jalo on the 23rd November.Operations subsequent to the 23rd November.38. Since the evening of the 23rd November few details of the operations have been received. From the confused accounts available, the burden of thefighting south-east of Tobruk appears to have passed temporarily to theunarmoured troops, the armoured formations having been withdrawn forreorganisation. The forces advancing westward from the frontier area aftercapturing Gambut had, by the morning of the 25th November, effected a junctionwith the troops operating east of Sidi Rezegh.39. On the 25th November an enemy force of some 30 tanks and 500 infantrywas located moving eastward across the frontier south of Sidi Omar, evidentlywith the intention of creating a diversion.Conclusion.40. It is too early to foretell the result of the engagements now in progresssouth-east of Tobruk. Casualties on both sides have undoubtedly been heavy.General Auchinleck has, however, succeeded in bringing the enemy&apos;s armoured forces to battle and has already destroyed a large number of his tanks. He has gone a long way towards rolling up the enemy&apos;s frontier defences, and it is to be hoped that the next few days will see the junction of the forces about Sidi Rezeghwith the Tobruk Garrison.Comparison with 1940 Campaign.41. Little detailed information is as yet available as to the part played by italian forces. It is, however, clear that with German stiffening and under german directions they have fought much better than they did in 1940, whenthey had to meet a British offensive alone.This improvement is probably partly due to the fact that in 1940 italian forces in Cyrenaica consisted of a motley collection of recently raised MetropolitanDivisions, and black shirt and Libyan formations, with a high command thatwas more intent on blaming the deficiencies of their equipment on each otherthan on preparing to meet a British attack. It is also no doubt to some extentto be attributed to the replacement of the &quot; toy &quot; 3-ton and unwieldy 11-tontanks by the more serviceable 13-ton tank, with which 132 (Ariete) armoured division is now equipped. Reports agree that this division, which is operating in the Bir el Gobi area, has put up a tenacious resistance. 55 (Savona) Division,which is operating in the Sollum sector, also appears to have fought well.East Africa.42. Five separate columns are advancing on the Italians in the Gondararea. In the north, Lamant Hill (11 miles north-east of Gondar) and VenticinqueHill (3 miles further south) were captured on the 12th and 17th Novemberrespectively. Our forces are now facing the enemy&apos;s main position some15 miles north of Gondar.On the 21st November a force which had been side-stepped eastwards fromthe main Debarech-Gondar road captured Zagadi (17 miles south-east of Gondar).In this engagement the enemy sustained 2,000 casualties while his force holdingthe Feroaber position (12 miles further south) was cut off from communicationwith Gondar.The column advancing north-westward along the Debra Tabor-Gondar roadcaptured Kulkaber, to the north of the Feroaber position, on the 21st November,and took 1,800 prisoners.An Ethiopian force which has advanced up the western shore of Lake Tanais investing Gorgora, which has also been heavily bombed from the air.The Sudanese column advancing along the Gallabat-Chelga roadis now in front of the Chelga position. A raid by this column on an enemy postnorth-west of Chelga on the 20th November inflicted heavy casualties and isbelieved to have drawn strong reinforcements from the Gondar area.Patriot forces are co-operating in all sectors.It is estimated that the garrison of Gondar still remaining consists of some12,000 Italian and native troops.
Intelligence.Spain.43. Confirmation has been received of the report that the number of german divisions between the River Gironde and the Spanish frontier has been reducedto two. There seems, therefore, no likelihood of early German action againstSpain.Italy.44. Reports continue to be received that the Italians are fortifying the brenner. In view of the wide variety of sources from which these reportsemanate, and the difficulty of seeing any reason why they should be deliberatelyspread by the Axis, it is not possible to dismiss them out of hand.If these fortifications are in fact proceeding, it seems that it can only be dueto the influence of a section of the army which is opposed to complete subservienceto Germany. This faction must therefore either be sufficiently powerful to compelMussolini to make concessions to its policy or be able to carry on the work without his knowledge.Balkans.45. There are indications that the strength of the German garrison inCrete may be raised from some 14,000 to approximately 30,000.While the total number of German divisions in the Balkans is believed toremain at fourteen, it is possible that some transfer of German troops may havetaken place recently from Bulgaria to the South Russian front.Roumania.46. A report announces the opening of a new railway in Bessarabia on the25th October. This stretches between Anciz and Ismail Port and is111 kilom. in length, linking up the port, which is on the north bank of the danube near its mouth, with the main railway to Cetatea-Alba.Bulgaria.47. Bulgarian labour corps troops are reported to be working on the roadsSkoplje-Kustendil-Plovdiv and Seres-Drama-Xanthe. Work on North-Southcommunications appears to have been suspended.No detailed information is available regarding the extent of co-operation byBulgarian forces in the German effort to restore order in Yugoslavia, but it isreliably reported that some towns south of Nis have been occupied by the bulgarians.Turkey.48. A series of field defences are being constructed east of the Sea ofMarmara, along the line of the Sakaria River from Bilecik (or possibly further south at Bozuyuk) through Geyve to the Black Sea. 10,000 labourers are saidto be engaged.North Africa.49. It is believed that since the 19th November all members of the GermanArmistice Commission in North Africa have appeared in uniform and are carrying arms. It is reported that they have been given authority to makearrests and bring culprits before the French Courts.A report just received states that 50 uniformed and armed Germans arrivedby air at Casablanca on the 23rd November.Far East.50. The situation in the Far East continues to be dominated by theWashington negotiations. The possibility of a satisfactory settlement is stillextremely doubtful.At the same time Japanese military preparations are continuing in thesouth, whilst the situation in the north remains generally static.It is reliably reported that since the beginning of November at least oneJapanese division has been withdrawn from North or Central China throughShanghai.   Its destination is at present unknown.
It is also probable that the forces in the south have recently been reinforced by a division from Japan.51. The present distribution of Japanese forces is believed to be asfollows : North-Japan : Seven divisions.One Tank Regiment.Korea : One division.Sakhalin : Two divisions.Manchukuo : 26 Divisions.7 Tank Regiments.Centre North China: Nine Divisions.Twelve Independent Mixed Brigades.Two Tank Regiments.Central China : Six divisions.Seven Independent Mixed Brigades.One Tank Regiment.South-Canton : Three divisions.   One Tank Regiment.Swatow : One Independent Mixed Brigade.Formosa : Three divisions.Hainan : One division.Indo-China North : One division.South : Three divisions.   One Tank Regiment.Total: 62 Divisions,20 Independent Mixed Brigades,13 Tank Regiments.Invasion.52. Few reports of invasion preparations or intentions have been received during the period under review. Sources continue to send descriptions of craftunder construction, and the greatest activity in this direction appears to be in belgium. One report states that mass production has been started of a 500-tonvessel with bows specially adapted for troop disembarkation. Date of completionis given as February 1942.AIR SITUATION.General Review.53. Operations against targets in Germany and Occupied Territory were again considerably restricted by bad weather.Air operations in support of the offensive in Libya have been on an intensivescale.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.54. Bomber Command despatched 13 sorties, and Fighter Command flew192 sorties on offensive operations over occupied territory and against shipping.Attacks on shipping are reported under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;55. Of two Stirlings despatched to attack the Osnabruck and Bremen areas,one attacked shipping instead owing to failure of cloud cover. It was engagedby eight Me. 109&apos;s, and shot down one of them in flames. The second Stirlingwas also attacked by eight Me. 109&apos;s, and was forced to abandon task. In the ensuing encounter, which lasted for 25 minutes, two Me. 109&apos;s were probably destroyed and one was damaged.
56. Hurricane bombers and Spitfires attacked a variety of targets inNorthern France and in Holland including aerodromes, factories and communi-cations. Spitfires attacked six Me. 109&apos;s on the ground at Calais-Marckaerodrome, destroying one, probably destroying a second and damaging a further three. They also machine-gunned personnel on Le Touquet aerodrome. the storage tanks of an alcohol factory at Fontaine-le-Dun, near Fecamp, were attacked by Spitfires, and a factory near St. Omer was bombed by Hurricanes,which registered several hits. Other targets attacked include motor transportnear Le Touquet, a goods train, a power station and barges near St. Omer,and a meteorological station and gun positions on Schouwen Island in Holland.57. During these operations our fighters destroyed in combat six enemy aircraft, probably destroyed one and damaged seven. Our losses were ninefighters, but one pilot was rescued.Night.58. The activities of the three Commands were again considerably restricted by continued bad weather. All bomber operations were cancelled on four nights of the week. Two hundred and fifty-eight sorties were flown, the principaltargets being the naval bases at Brest and Lorient and the docks at Emden,Ostend, Dunkirk and Cherbourg. A total of 193 tons of H.E. bombs and 13,384incendiaries were dropped.59. Naval targets at Brest and Lorient were attacked on two nightsby a total of 25 heavy bombers which dropped 107 tons of H.E. bombs.On the first night observation was difficult owing to thick cloud. but on thesecond there was bright moonlight with good visibility. The docks were seenclearly, but the battle cruisers were obscured by a smoke screen. It is believedthat a large proportion of the bombs dropped close to the battle cruisers. Forty-five tons of H.E. bombs were dropped on Lorient. Bursts were seen in the dock area and fires were started in the vicinity of the Southern Dry Docks.60. A heavy attack was made on Emden on which a total of 87 tons of H.E.bombs and 11,000 iiicendiaries were dropped. Owing to thick cloud results couldnot be observed. At Cherbourg, where visibility was good, 23 tons of H.E. bombs were dropped in the dock area and bombs were seen to burst across the docks andon quays and wharves. A total of 20 tons of H.E. bombs was dropped on the docks at Dunkirk and Ostend. At the latter many bursts were seen in the dock area, where a number of fires were started.61.   Pamphlets were dropped in the Paris, Orleans, Dunkirk and Brest areas.62. Havocs and Hurricanes of Fighter Command bombed aerodromes inNorthern France.United Kingdom.63.   Fighter Command flew 1,737 sorties by day and 429 sorties by night.64. Enemy operations by day were very limi ted. A few bombs were dropped in coastal areas.65. At night no concentrated attack developed, although individual aircraftdropped bombs or parachute mines on several nights in the East and South-Westcoastal areas. Three enemy aircraft were destroyed by night during the week,and a Ju. 88 which got lost was captured intact.Coastal Operations.66. Unfavourable weather again hampered operations against enemy shipping. Coastal Command flew 173 patrols (291 sorties) and provided26 convoy escorts (49 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols by fighter Command totalled 505 (1,314 sorties).[23200] c
67. A Stirling of Bomber Command (previously referred to inparagraph 55) made a daylight attack off Borkum on a convoy consisting of four merchant vessels, two of 10,000 tons each and two of 8,000 tons. bursts were seen close to the two larger vessels. Another convoy consisting of two merchant vessels, each of about 8,000 tons, escorted by a large trawler, was attacked off the Lister Light by a Hudson. One of the merchant vessels was hit by a bomb and by machine-gun fire. Two coastal vessels of 700 and 900 tons respectively were attacked by Hudsons off the West Coast of France. The largervessel was just missed by two bombs and the smaller was hit several times bycannon and machine-gun fire. Another Hudson probably hit a 2-3,000-ton merchant vessel off Borkum. A small merchant vessel off Egero on the south-west of Norway was hit by a Beaufort, and a 5,000-ton merchant vessel off Egersundwas probably hit by another Beaufort.68.   Spitfires scored hits on two flak ships off Cape Gris Nez and on bargesnear Gravelines.69.   Ten aircraft laid mines off Lorient, Brest and the Frisian Islands.70. There were several enemy attacks on shipping, including an attack onthe 24th against a ship off Carnsore Point in Eireann territorial waters. Routineweather reconnaissances were flown over the North Sea, the English Channel andthe Atlantic. Aircraft of the Condor unit were active on four days of the week in rather more than average strength west and south-west of Bordeaux.Central Mediterranean.71. Air operations against enemy communications in the Mediterranean have continued. On the 2t0h, six Blenheims were despatched to attack a convoy offS.W. Greece, consisting of two medium-sized merchant ships escorted by a destroyer and a Ju. 88. The Ju. 88 was driven off, but intense A.A. fire preventeda low-level attack being made. Near-misses were observed on the destroyer andthe larger merchant ship. On the following night Wellingtons and naval aircraft attacked a convoy consisting of one cruiser, five destroyers and five merchant ships, 12 miles off Cape Spartivento (Sicily). The cruiser was hit by a torpedoand a probable hit was also made on a 7,000-ton merchant ship. No hits by bombs are claimed, but many of the ships were straddled. A very effective smoke-screen hampered our bombers and accurate A.A. fire was encountered. OneSword fish is missing.72. On the 26th, Blenheims attacked shipping off the coast of Tripoli (L)and made two hits on a 7,000-ton liner and one on a destroyer. On the next day the liner was sighted 300 yards from shore, stationary and low in the water. Asmall naval vessel was bombed and probably sunk by Blenheims in ArgostoliHarbour.73. Naval Swordfish mined the approaches to Tripoli (L) on two nights and bombed the town as a diversion. Nuisance raids were made against Naples,Messina and Brindisi, where a large fire was started. Five Hurricanes made adaylight attack on Comiso aerodrome, Sicily, and made nits, on hangars anddispersed aircraft.74.   Reconnaissance sorties were flown over the Ionian Sea, south-westGreece and the Central Mediterranean.75- Italian fighters which made a daylight attack on Haifar aerodrome,Malta, causing slight damage to an aircraft and A.A. post, were- engaged by hurricanes, which probably destroyed one of them and damaged two. on another occasion Italian fighters approaching Malta were intercepted by jHurricanes, which destroyed three of them, probably destroyed two and damagedfour more. Bombs were dropped on the island by a few aircraft on three nightswithout effect.Libya.76. The British air forces in the. Middle East, including Australian andSouth African Squadrons and a squadron of Free French Blenheims, were engaged in intensive operations in support of our offensive in the Western) Desert.
77. In close support of ground forces our light bombers were in continuousaction by day, and on one day a total of eleven squadron sorties were flown byMarylands and Blenheims. On the 20th mary lands made a successful attack on anenemy armoured force moving south from Capuzzo, and on the 22nd 12 Blenheimsdestroyed at least 100 M.T., including ten petrol tankers, on the El Adem-Acromaroad, and exploded a munition dump. Both these forces were intercepted by german fighters, and lost four aircraft on each occasion. Subsequently, fighter escort or cover was provided for our bombers operating in the main battle area, and their casualties were light. Heavy losses were inflicted on the enemy armoured force which was approaching the frontier area on the 25th. To thesouth, smaller forces attacked enemy transport at Bir-el-Gobi and Bir-Hakeim.Blenheims from Malta made three attacks on transport along the coast road between Tripoli and Sirte and destroyed many vehicles, including petrol tankers,which were set on fire. They also attacked an aerodrome and landing ground nearSirte.78. Besides escorting bomber formations our fighters constantly patrolledthe battle area. During a low sweep, 18 enemy M.T. were destroyed and on another occasion Hurricanes attacked about 30 enemy aircraft on Binina aero-drome, including troop transports and gliders, destroying four and damagingat least eight others. Beaufighters made low-flying attacks against enemy aero-dromes at El Tmimi, Slonta (near Gyrene), Barce and Jedabya; petrol tankerswere destroyed and much damage was done, notably at El Tmimi and Barce,where 14 Ju. 87s, four S. 79s and an Me. 109 were destroyed. At Jedabya, a transport aircraft was forced to crash when landing. Transport in the Barcearea was also attacked and four petrol tankers and several lorries were destroyed.79. On the 20th, nine fighter sweeps, totalling 177 sorties, were flown over the battle area. Nine Ju. 87s, escorted by 15 Me. 109s, were attacked and forced tojettison their bombs. Seven Ju. 87s, four Me. 110s and one Me. 109 were shot downduring the day for the loss of seven of our fighters and three pilots. On the 25th,. 20 Tomahawks intercepted a mixed force of about 60 German and Italian bombers,escorted by fighters, and destroyed ten of the enemy, probably destroyed three and damaged eight, with the loss of only two Tomahawks. Since the beginningof the battle, at least 52 enemy aircraft have been shot down by our fighters, ofwhich we have lost 24, some of whose pilots, however, are known to be safe.Approximately 40 further enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.80. During the early part of the week, our night offensive was directed against targets in Eastern Cyrenaica. On the night of the 19th/20th, 43 tonsof bombs were dropped at Derna and ten tons at Bardia, and on the following night 32 Wellingtons attacked the aerodrome and landing grounds at El Gazala.On the four succeeding nights Benghazi was attacked the aerodromes of Bercaand Binina by a total of 61 Wellingtons, and the harbour district by 44. aircraft from Malta as well as from Egypt took part in these attacks. On the aerodromes,hits were made on petrol and bomb dumps and on buildings; in the harbourdistrict, bursts were seen on a landing stage and in the area of the railway,workshops, Customs Houses and Military Headquarters. Two 4,000-lb. bombsexploded near the base of the Cathedral mole, resulting in large explosions and fires.   Five Wellingtons were lost during these operations.81. Reconnaissance aircraft from Egypt covered the area between Creteand the Libyan coast in search of shipping, and on the 24th sighted a convoyabout 65 miles west of Crete. A striking force of Blenheims despatched to attack the convoy failed to locate it, but the merchant ships were subsequently sunk bya naval force from Malta, as reported under &quot; Naval Situation.&quot; Tacticalreconnaissances were flown daily over the battle area and a close watch was kepton enemy movements at Benghazi.82. Heavy rain and floods which made aerodromes unserviceable and communications difficult, hampered the operation of the enemy air forces, whichwere mainly employed in the protection of their bases and support of their groundtroops. Their operations against our fleet were on a light scale, and bombing ofour back areas was not heavy or particularly effective. No attacks were made against Alexandria or the Canal zone.[23200] c 2
A ir Intelligence.83. The main concentration of Axis aircraft is in the Benghazi area, whichis probably congested.84. The effect of the strained Axis supply situation should become apparentwithin the next few days, in spite of the liberal employment of Ju. 52 transport aircraft to improve matters.85. The following reinforcements have reached Libya since our offensivestarted : (a) German. About 25 Ju. 88&apos;s were sent to Cyrenaica from Greece at thebeginning of the offensive, but have since returned to Athens, probablyowing to shortage of fuel at Benghazi.Some 25 Me. 110&apos;s were brought from Crete and Sicily toCyrenaica, but the majority of these have been lost and not replaced.Fifteen Ju. 87&apos;s came from Crete. No reinforcements of Me. 109&apos;shave been received, but some are probably coming.Two to three hundred Ju. 52 transport aircraft from Russia and eastern Germany are now being employed in the Libyan campaign.(b) Italian. Replacements for the existing squadrons in Cyrenaica are notbeing regularly received, but reinforcements by new units comprising70 aircraft of all types have arrived.It is believed that 25 Italian Ju. 87&apos;s have reached Tripolitaniaand that some of them may have moved forward to Cyrenaica.East Africa.86. Our bombers and fighters flew 95 sorties during the week in supportof land operations in the Gondar area. On the 21st, during operations whichculminated in the capture of Feroaber and Kulkaber, 54 sorties were flown, which included attacks on trenches and machine-gun posts.Aden.87. Patrols and reconnaissances were flown along the French Somalilandfrontier and over Jibuti, on which leaflets were also dropped. On the 22nd threeVincents, escorted by two Blenheims, transported a party to carry out the demolition of two forts under the terms of an ultimatum accepted by a Beihanchieftain.Russia.Air Operations.88.   No reports have been received.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.89. Although bombs were dropped on five days and six nights of the week,the total number of incidents was very small.Damage.90.   Very little damage, none of which was important, has been reported.Casualties.91. Estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 Wednesday,26th November, are 7 killed and 25 seriously injured.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. In combining thefigures for non-tankers (which are compiled as at the end of the month) with those for tankers (which are compiled as at the 15th of the month) certain slight differenceshave had to be brought into a common form.(1) (a) These comprised 47 tankers of 385,000 gross tons.(6) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A substantial part of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage, e.g., to the middle east (see note (3) ).(d) In recent months the proportion of this tonnage which did no importing to the United Kingdom (Armed Merchant Cruisers, Eoyal Fleet Auxiliaries, hospital ships, &amp;c.) has amounted to rather more than one-half.(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eire.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from Air Reconnaissance and Intelligence sources : Germany.Berlin. On the night of the 12th/13th August, 1941, a heavy bomb isreported to have fallen in Zehlendorf, a suburb on the south-west of Berlin. Itfell in the middle of an open space of some four to six acres, on which fruittrees and vegetables were growing. The area was surrounded with dwelling houses.The bomb crater did not appear to be very large. The nearest house, approxi-mately 80 yards distant, was very severely damaged, although the walls were stillstanding. Windows and roofs were damaged throughout a considerable area.All the glass and most of the tiles were missing from houses within a radius of300 yards, while the effects of the bomb could be seen on buildings 400 or 500 yardsfrom the crater.nurnberg. The -aluminium works received several direct hits causing a stoppage of work.General. The Hamburger Fremdenblatt of the 31st October publishes the names of 52 persons killed in the raid on Hamburg on the night of the 26th/27th.Occupied France.Donges. In the raid of the 28th/29th September, eleven tanks of about 100ton capacity each caught fire and a total of 600 tons of diesel oil was burnt. the damage was estimated at approximately  50,000 at pre-war rate of exchange.Lille Area. -A further report tells of the widespread disorganisation ofindustry in the neighbourhood due to our attacks on the power supply. In manycases factories received power for a limited number of hours per day, and thesituation was complicated by the fact that they were not informed in advance at what time the power would be available.Rouen. In the raid on the power station at Rouen on the 18th Septemberone bomb hit a metal girder in the glass roof covering the centre of the engine room. It exploded instantaneously, thereby causing only slight damage to themachinery but some casualties among personnel. Other bombs fell on two worksnearby, one of which was the St. Gobain chemical factory.Italy.Naples. In attacks at the end of October a factory making caustic soda was hit.  It is thought production would be affected for a month.
