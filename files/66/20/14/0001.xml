THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.SECRET. Copy Now.p. (41) 291.November 27, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.DURING the last two or three days I have had prolonged discussions with several of my colleagues on this matter. I have reached the conclusion that itwould be advisable to make certain changes in the scheme which had been drawnup on the basis of the discussion in the War Cabinet on the 10th November.*Upper age limit for Compulsory National Service.2. At that Meeting, the War Cabinet decided provisionally in favour of new legislation, imposing on all persons of either sex between the ages of 18 and 60 theobligation to undertake some form of national service, either in the Armed Forces,in Civil Defence, or in Industry.3. Since power already exists to direct men and women to industry withoutlimit of age, the real effect of this legislation would be :- (a) To raise the age for compulsory military service for men from 41 to 61;and(b) To apply to women, for the first time, the principle of compulsory service in the Auxiliary and Civil Defence Services.* W.M. (41), 110th Conclusions, Minute 1.[23199]
24. I have reached the conclusion that the upper age limit should in presentcircumstances be 51. To impose an upper limit of 61 would not make anyvery substantial additional number of men available for the Forces, and wouldbe likely to cause more inconvenience and disturbance than it was worth. Theage limit can always be raised later if desired.Compulsory Recruitment of Women into the Auxiliary or Civil Defence Services.5. The legislation referred to in paragraph 2 imposes an obligation toundertake some form of National Service on all women aged 18-50. But I proposeto make it clear that the Government&apos;s present intention is to proclaim the ages20-30 only, so that (subject to the option described below) compulsion to join the auxiliary and Civil Defence Services will only be applied to women in theseage groups.6.   We have already agreed (a) that no women would be entered for combatant service (i.e., which involved the use of lethal weapons) unless they specifically volunteeredtherefor;(b) that women, upon being compulsorily recruited into the Auxiliary or civil Defence Services, would receive the same protection and safe-guards as men called up for compulsory military service; and(c) that married women would be exempt.7. Women in the 20-30 age group on being called up would be given an option between (a) The Auxiliary Services.(b) Civil Defence Services.(c) Certain specified jobs in industry, eg., filling factories which, owing totheir location, can only be filled by women transferred from a distance.8. It is not practicable to give women an effective option between W.R.N.S.,W.A.A.F. and A.T.S.. owing to the fact that most of the vacancies are in theA.T.S.9. The position in this respect corresponds broadly with the position inregard to men. In future a man will not be able to exercise option for the R.A.F.as such, but only for certain specified duties in the R.A.F., e.g., pilots or aircrews. A scheme may be devised whereby women will be allowed to opt forcertain duties in the Auxiliary Services, e.g., radio location.10. It is, however, thought that it should prove possible to give women an effective option between (a), (b) and (c) in paragraph 7, having regard to thelarge number required for (c).11. Any women already engaged in one of the vital war industries willnot be called up for the Auxiliary or Civil Defence Services.
12. Women engaged in the less essential industries or unoccupied womenwill be subject to a similar deferment procedure to that applied to men.Married Women.1U. Married women will not be called up for the Auxiliary or Civil defence services.  A married woman can, however, volunteer for these services.14. If a married woman doe^--nefe--TOkuiteex/^iN1th^ Auxiliary or civil defence Services  .^&apos;sS^CL-l^^(a) if childless, she can $mbject to dorhestic circumstances) be directed toan industrial jobjsubject also to the proviso that an undertaking hasbeen given that the  wives of men in the Services will not be directedaway from home.(b) if she has a child she can volunteer for work which she can combinewith domestic duties. It is proposed to extend the opportunity forthis type of work by organising day nurseries and part-time shifts.T5T Considerable emphasis should be laid, in the presentation of theGovernments case, on the need for utilising the services of large numbers of married and older women. Employers should be urged to take all practicable steps to facilitate the employment of married women, and thereby to release mobilewomen for essential industry. It is important that the Government should setan example in this matter themselves, by organising employment on half-shiftson the largest possible scale.16. I propose that we should reaffirm the other main decisions reached at our meeting on the 10th November, namely : (a) To abandon the system of block reservation by occupation, in favour of asystem of individual deferment;(&amp;) A drastic review of individual deferment;Effect has already been given to the decision that young men should in future be called up for the Armed Forces at the age of 18-J.Training of Boys and Girls.17. I recommend the adoption of the scheme set out in the Lord PresidentsPaper W.P. (G) (41) 137, the essential features of which are that boys and girlsaged 16 to 18 should be required to register; thereafter, arrangements should bemade for them to be interviewed, and they should be encouraged to join one orother of the organisations through which they can obtain the training requiredto fit them for national service; or to undertake industrial employment or voluntary work of national importance.-w. s. c.27th November, 1941.
