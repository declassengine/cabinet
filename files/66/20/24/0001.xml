NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.AN Italian battle fleet has been at sea covering convoys to North Africa.Two Italian cruisers have been sunk in the Central Mediterranean.H.M.S. Galatea has been sunk by U-boat near Alexandria.Three, possibly four, German U-boats have been sunk west of Gibraltar.British and Russian submarines report successes from the mediterranean and Northern Waters.Shipping losses, apart from seizures in the Far East, have been slight.Home and Northern Waters.2. H.M. Destroyer Puckeridge was severely damaged by bombs off milford haven on the morning of the 17th and was towed into harbour.H.M. Canadian Destroyer Restigouche suffered considerable damage fromheavy weather whilst on escort duty south of Iceland (C) on the 14th.H.M. Submarine Sealion sank an eastbound merchant ship in the North Capearea on the 5th.Russian submarines also report successes from the North Cape area, where onthe 28th November D 3 sank an escorted 6,000-ton ship, on the 5th December anescorted 10,000-ton ship and on the 6th a 5/6,000-ton ship . K 23 on the26th November sank a 600-ton ship by gunfire off Loppen Island (Fuglo Sound).H.M. Minesweepers Hazard and Speedy were in action with enemy surface craft, thought to be destroyers, at the entrance to the White Sea on the evening of the 17th.   Speedy sustained slight damage and two casualties.It is estimated that 13,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or damaged by our aircraft during the period. Details are given under air situation.North Atlantic.3. H.M. Trawler Lady Shirley disappeared without trace from patrol inthe Straits of Gibraltar on the 11th, and it is feared that she has been sunk bya U-boat.H.M. Trawler Loch Oskaig was bombed and damaged off Lisbon on the 12thbut was able to proceed on patrol; she was again attacked and claims to have hitthe aircraft.Mediterranean.4. Before dawn on the 13th, when off Cape Bon, H.M. Destroyers Sikh,Legion and Maori and the Dutch Destroyer Isaac Sweers made contact with theItalian cruisers Alberto di Giussano and Alberico da Barbiano (5,069 tons,8 6-inch guns) and two torpedo boats, on a southerly course. A Wellingtonaircraft also sighted the force and the enemy hearing her engines turned back,thereby placing our destroyers in a most favourable position for attack. Theallied ships had the initiative and opened fire with guns and torpedoes. The two cruisers were set on fire and sunk; one of the torpedo boats was sunk and theother severely damaged.   Our ships suffered no casualties or damage.H.M. Cruiser Galatea (5,270 tons, 6 6-inch guns, complement about 450)was sunk by a U-boat to the westward of Alexandria on the night of 14th/15th.She was hit by at least two torpedoes amidships.  There are about 150 survivors.On the morning of the 17th a force of 3 Italian battleships, with cruisers and destroyers, was sighted west of Navarino, and a similar force was sightedfive hours later 80 miles to the westward with four merchant ships in company.H.M. Cruisers Naiad, A %irora and Penelope with 14 destroyers made contact withthis force at nightfall and engaged it for half an hour but later lost touch. Whatappeared to be the same Italian force was sighted by aircraft about noon on thefollowing day, 180 miles to the east of Tripoli, apparently steering for that port.
5.   The following successes by ELM. Submarines have been reported :-Triumph torpedoed a merchant ship and a salvage tug in Candia Harbour(Crete) on the 24th November.Upright attacked two large unidentified ships and a destroyer south ofTaranto on the night of the 12th/13th and obtained 4 hits.Urge reported that she attacked two Italian battleships of the Cavour classsouth of Messina on the morning of the 14th and that she obtained 2 hits on oneof them.(Reconnaissance on the 15th showed five Italian battleships at Taranto.)A 6,000-ton Italian merchant vessel is reported beached south of Navarinoafter being torpedoed by Porpoise.On the evening of the 14th Talisman, when about 60 miles south of easternCrete, shelled a U-boat and obtained a hit at the base of the conning tower.Thunderbolt sank a 300-ton schooner in the Kithera Channel on the25th November and Proteus sank a laden supply caique in the same area on the8th December.Our aircraft have sunk or damaged 15,000 tons of enemy shipping. details are given under Air Situation.During the week upward of 38,000 tons of French merchant shipping passed gibraltar westbound and over 15,000 tons eastward.Far East.Philippines.6. On the 13th it was reported that United States aircraft had hit a secondbattleship of the Haruna class off Luzon, and on the 14th obtained 3 hits on abattleship, probably of the same class. This latter ship was last seen on fire.Aircraft also seriously damaged a transport at Legaspi.Malaya.7. The Dutch Sbumarine 0.16 sank four southbound laden transports offPatani on the 12th, and K .12 sank a merchant ship and an oiler on the 12th and13th respectively off Kota Bahru.A convoy of about 100 ships escorted by aircraft carriers, destroyers and submarines was reported off the Indo-China coast on the night of the 12th/13th,and on the 14th a convoy, believed to be the same one, was reported in CamranhBay.Hong Kong.8. H.M. Destroyer Thracian destroyed two river boats in Kowloon Bayon the 14th.Pacific Islands.9. Johnson Island, 750 miles W.N.W. of Hawaii, has been bombarded by twosurface vessels. Wake Island was bombed on the night of the 15th/16th and onthe following day. A Japanese U-boat fired several rounds at Kahulu on MawiIsland (Hawaii) on the 16th.Anti-Submarine Operations.10. H.M. Destroyers Croome, Foxhound and Nestor destroyed a U-boat tothe southward of Cape St. Vincent on the 15th.On the 17th the escort of a homeward-bound convoy, including aircraft froman auxiliary carrier, about 400 miles to the westward of Gibraltar located and sank U. 131 and took 55 prisoners. A Martlet aircraft was shot down in theencounter and the pilot killed.Contacts with U-boats following this convoy continued on the 18th and atleast one, and probably two, more were sunk by the escorts.In addition to other attacks in the Gibraltar area U-boats have also been attacked by aircraft off St. Nazaire and by surface craft west of the Canaries.[23267] b
Enemy Intelligence.Main Units.11. Ail the German main units except Seidlitz and Lutzow are now considered to be fit for sea. In the Baltic, Tirpitz, Scheer and Hipper, have beencontinuing their exercises. At Brest the Prinz Eugen was seen to have left dry dock and moved alongside the fuelling station on the 15th.U-boats. e12. There has been very little U-boat activity in the past week and thegeneral trend of submarines to the Mediterranean seems to have continued. Anumber have passed Gibraltar, and there are indications that several may have turned back after having been attacked and damaged.Japan.13. The Japanese losses in the operations in the Far East are believed tobe one battleship sunk and two damaged, in addition to casualties to light craft and transports.Enemy Attacks on Seaborne Trade.14. During the period one ship has been sunk by mine off the Humber.U-Boats have sunk a British ship off Cape Spartel, a Spanish ship off Malaga anda Portuguese ship to the south-west of Gape St. Vincent. A British tanker was torpedoed off Alexandria but reached harbour. Last week a Norwegian and aBritish ship were sunk off Luzon and a British ship was damaged in Manila.Little information from the Far East of mercantile losses has yet been received,but it is known that some British ships, including a number of local tradingvessels, have been seized by the Japanese, who claim to have captured 120,000gross tons.Protection of Seaborne Trade.15. During the week ending 17th December, 998 ships, including 226 allied and 32 neutral, were convoyed. One cruiser, two armed merchant cruisers, 5 anti-aircraft ships, 86 destroyers (including 25 United States destroyers) and 110sloops, corvettes and minesweepers were employed on escort duties.Imports into the United Kingdom during the week ending 13th Decembertotalled 1,043,000 tons compared with 973,000 tons during the previous week andan average of 948,000 for the past ten weeks. There were 350,000 tons of oil ofvarious grades.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.16. Enemy minelaying by aircraft was mainly concentrated on the east coast between Flamborough Head and Yarmouth, but Plymouth and Falmouthwere visited on one night.Seventeen magnetic and nine acoustic mines have been destroyed during theweek. The mine totals are now : Magnetic 1,613, acoustic 1,191 and contact 1,063.Enemy Merchant Shipping.17. According to a broadcast from Oslo, the Norwegian coaster Topaz,(142 tons), was bombed and sunk by a British aircraft on the 14th December offthe west coast of Norway.   The crew of six were lost.The German Osorno, 6,957 tons, which has been in dock, returned to heranchorage at Yokahama on the 2nd December.   She appeared to be unarmed.        \There are 36 German and Italian ships in Japanese controlled ports.Thirteen of these have sufficient endurance to sail to Europe without refuellingon the voyage.Vichy Merchant Shipping.18. The sailings of Vichy ships through the Straits of Gibraltar declinedduring November to 50 per cent, of the monthly average from January to August
1941. This is due partly to a seasonal decline in the exports from French WestAfrica, partly to our interference with Vichy shipping in the Far Eastern route and partly to fuel shortage. Services between unoccupied France and french north Africa have been maintained, the total tonnage remaining approximately the same, though the number of ships employed now is only about half as many as in 1940. At least 20 of the British, Allied and Danish ships held by the vichy authorities after the armistice are now employed on this route; they totalsome 50,500 tons. Convoys have been introduced between French North africa and France, but otherwise activity seems to be much as usual.Thirty-one Vichy ships, totalling approximately 137,000 tons, are in far eastern waters, eleven of them passenger liners. None of them is reported tohave sailed for France since Japan entered the war.Twelve merchant ships and two tankers, totalling 150,746 tons, were seizedin United States ports by U.S. authorities on the 13th December.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Central sector.19. The Russians have had marked successes both North and South of moscow, i.e., from Klin and Tula areas, where the Germans have been forcedback with heavy casualties and much loss of equipment. Between these twosectors the Germans have made a slight withdrawal in the Zvenigorod area (duewest of Moscow).20. The depth of the withdrawal in the Tula area between Ser Prudy andUrusovo is as much as some 60 miles.Ukraine.21. There has been no change. Despite heavy casualties the Germanscontinue to hold the line of the River Mius and possibly Taganrog.Crimea.22. The Russians still hold Sevastopol. No German attempt has been madeto cross the Kerch Strait.Conclusions.23. After attempting for over two months to capture Moscow the Germansapparently decided to stabilise and withdraw to a shorter line suitable for defenceduring the winter. Their unsuccessful offensives had, however, so much reduced their fighting capacity that the Russians have been able to launch and press homeheavy counter-attacks along nearly the whole of the Central sector. TheRussians now hold the initiative and have removed, at any rate for the winter,the threat to Moscow and the railway to Riazhsk and Voronezh. It is too early to estimate what the outcome of this fighting will be, but the Germans may well have to revise their original intentions as to their winter line.Libya.24. Last week&apos;s Resume covered the period up to the 9th December, by which date El Adem had been occupied, but the enemy was still resisting strongly west of Tobruk.25. On the 10th December the enemy evacuated Acroma and it became apparent that a general withdrawal on Gazala, 35 miles west of Tobruk, was taking place. The enemy&apos;s new line extended from Gazala for some 25 milessouthward. His main position was about Gazala with a tank detachment astride the Trigh El Abd. The remaining Axis armoured forces, by this time reducedto about 50 tanks and some lorried infantry, were disposed in the centre of hisline, some 12 miles south of Gazala,
26. Practically all the Axis forces in Cyrenaica which were fit for battle(the greater part of two Italian motorised divisions, two infantry divisions andthe remnants of the three Axis armoured divisions) faced the 8th Army in theenemy&apos;s new position. In spite of this display of strength, it was believed thatGeneral Rommel was contemplating a further withdrawal, probably to the lineMekili-Derna, as soon as his preparations were complete. General Ritchie&apos;s aimwas therefore twofold : to bring the enemy to battle and destroy the greatest possible part of his forces before he could withdraw to the difficult country furtherwest and to forestall him on the Mekili-Derna line.27. By the 11th December, while a New Zealand formation was in contact with the enemy&apos;s main position some 6 miles east of Gazala, Indian troops, jsupported by &quot; I &quot; tanks, were ordered to by-pass Gazala to the South andadvance North-West across the enemy&apos;s line of withdrawal. Meanwhile, mixedmobile columns of tanks, armoured cars, artillery and lorried infantry were directed in a wide sweep around the enemy&apos;s southern flank towards Derna,Mekili and Tmimi.28. Throughout the 12th and 13th December, while the New Zealandersmade steady inroads into the Gazala position, a series of heavy counter-attacks were launched on the Indian formations advancing against the enemy&apos;s centre.These were repulsed with the loss to the enemy of 16 tanks. On the following dayfurther tank counter-attacks in this area were driven off. Progress was, however,slow.29. On the evening of the 15th December the situation was confused, butappeared to be developing favourably. Moreover, it was apparent that, whateverhad been General Rommel&apos;s original intention, the bulk of his force was nowcommitted to battle on the Gazala line. An armoured force was accordinglydespatched around the enemy&apos;s southern flank directed upon Bir Haiegh El Elebaand Tmimi. By the 16th December, part of this force was astride the Gazala-Derna road at Tmimi, while the remainder was engaging the enemy north of theTrigh El Abd from the rear. Details of this engagement are not available, butit is known that four German tanks were destroyed.30. During the night of the 16th/ 17th December the anticipated with-drawal began. Under cover of darkness a force of tanks and M.T., probably thebulk of the remnants of the two German armoured divisions, succeeded in slippingaway from the battle field and is thought to have by-passed Tmimi and made its way to the vicinity of Derna. The remainder of the enemy forces stayed in their position until the morning of the 17th December, when they, too, began to with-draw. During the 17th December our troops pursued the retreating enemy fora distance of over 30 miles. By the late afternoon our armoured forces, with indian troops in close support, had crossed the Mekili-Tmimi road on a widefront with lighter mobile forces thrown out widely towards Mekili and to theNorth-West.31. Meanwhile, in the frontier area, the enemy is still holding out in the half aj^a position and at Bardia, where he is subjected to ever-increasing pressure from the South African investing force. The third enemy strong point atGhirba, north of Sidi Omar, surrendered on the 11th December, and there seemslittle doubt that the supply situation of the remaining garrisons in this area iscritical.To sum up 32.   A great deal depends on the degree of confusion which can be created in the enemy forces now retiring from the Gazala position.   The weather is bad,the enemy is to a great extent highly mobile.   Nevertheless, whatever may be general Rommel&apos;s intention on reaching Derna, he is unlikely to have more than   .a much disorganised force at his disposal. &apos;The Far East.General.33. In the light of events during the past week it seems probable that theJapanese plan was to seize as many U.S.A. islands as possible, so as to interruptcommunications between America and the Philippines. To achieve this aim itwas essential to knock out, partially or temporarily, the main U.S. Pacific base
at Pearl Island Harbour (Hawaii), against which the risk of attempting a majorcombined operation at a distance by sea of some 3,500 miles was overwhelming, solong as the American fleet was in being and at sea. Hence the surprise air attack which in the result was very successful. The island ring secured, Japan wouldthen be in a position to conduct operations against her main objects of singapore and the Philippines without having constantly to watch her eastern flank.34. At the outbreak of war with Britain and the United States, Japan hadavailable 62 divisions, of which approximately 14 are now committed in the south.As reserves available immediately, or at short notice, it is believed that she has afurther 14 divisions and sufficient shipping to transport the equivalent of12 divisions.35. The present estimated enemy strength in North Malaya is three divisions and one tank regiment.36. The chief factors in the situation at present appear to be time and theattitude of Russia. Japan must have quick results in view of her difficulteconomic situation and the inevitability of defeat, if the United States and ourselves are given time in which to build up our strength against her. Sheis also anxious not to start another front in the North, whilst fighting is still inprogress on the southern and China fronts.It therefore appears that after the initial phases of the war are over, theposition of Japan, who has now been at war for over four years in China, willbecome precarious if operations are opened on her northern front, and if sufficient time becomes available to the United States and ourselves to strengthen our military position in the Far East.Malaya.37. In North-East. Malaya 8 Indian Inf. Bde. holding the Kota Bharuarea has been reinforced with one battalion and one field battery, and has nowfallen back to a line covering Machang aerodrome (25 miles south of Kota Bharu).Since the 12th December activity has been confined to patrols.38. In North-West Malaya heavy attacks by Japanese forces estimated atone division (subsequently reinforced by a second division) supported by a tankregiment (150 tanks) have forced back 11 Indian Division, with 12 Indian Inf.Bde. protecting its flank, to the line of the River Muda (12 miles north of Penangand approximately 70 miles from the frontier.Heavy casualties in personnel and equipment have been suffered. and our troops have fought without respite. 6 Indian Inf. Bde. on our left were cut off and suffered severe casualties.39. Penang, from which some troops have already been Avithdrawn to join the Kedah battle, is now seriously threatened. Heavy air attacks have produced a difficult position.40. Japanese attacks are being pressed home with fanatical courage in spiteof heavy losses.Sarawak.41. A Japanese landing took place on the 16th December at Miri, fromwhich our small garrison, having completed the oil denial scheme, had been successfully withdrawn to Kuching.No attack on North Borneo has yet been attempted.Hong Kong.42.   In face of increased enemy pressure in superior numbers, our forceswithdrew from the mainland and Stonecutters Island to Hong Kong Island in[23267] c
accordance with the defence plan. The movement began at dusk on the11th December and was completed during the following night without muchinterference. All artillery and armoured cars were successfully evacuated,together with most of the carriers and M.T. The coast defence guns on Stone-cutters Island, the dockyard and important military establishments on the mainland were demolished before evacuation.Japanese artillery has bombarded the gun positions, naval dockyard andpillboxes on the north shore of the Island with some effect, but military casualties have so far been light. Our own artillery have effectively shelled enemy batteriesand troop concentrations on the mainland.Concentrations of ferry craft on the mainland shore and of enemy troopsoh Lamma Island, approximately two miles to the south-west of Hong Kong-Island, indicate that landings may shortly be attempted.Civilian morale, though shaken at first, is improving and the distributionof rice is becoming less difficult.On the 13th December, and again on the 17th, the Governor refused demands for surrender.Western Pacific.43. Ocean and Nauru Islands have been bombed from the air. Thephosphate plants at both places have been demolished by us, according to plan.Three small islands in the Gilbert group have been occupied by the Japanese.Portuguese Timor.44. It has been announced by the Netherlands East Indies Government thaton the morning of the 17th December Portuguese Timor was occupied by dutch and Australian Forces.  As far as is known, the occupation took place quietly.Burma.45. The general situation in Burma is reported as being quiet. all necessary defence arrangements have been put into operation and all japanese and about 300 Fifth Columnists arrested. Victoria Point, Mergui and Tavoy(all in Tenasserim) have been bombed, but Rangoon so far has had warnings only.Japanese forces are reported to have landed on the Thai coast atChumphorn and Prachuab Kirikhan, and to have occupied Marang (35 miles north-East of Victoria Point, in Tenasserim).The plan for demolitions of Victoria Point has been put into effect, andthe garrison withdrawn.A raiding party from Mergui to cut the railway south of Prachuab Kirikhanmet strong enemy opposition and suffered some casualties. It withdrew withoutachieving its object.Commander-in-Chief, India, assumed command of Burma, with effect fromthe 15th December, 1941.Intelligence.France.46. Recent reports provide no confirmation of the rumours of a Germanconcentration in S.W. France. It is probable, however, that a number of tireddivisions have returned from the Eastern Front to France for rest and refit. to balance this, there are indications of the departure eastwards, as drafts, of an equivalent number of troops, including possibly one low-category division for. of C. duties.The estimate of German divisions in France remains at 24, of which two are in the area south of the River Gironde. Air reconnaissance of the Westernend of the Franco-Spanish frontier on the 11th and 12th December reveals nounusual activity.
AIR SITUATION. ;General Review.47. Slight improvement in the weather enabled our bombers to resume night operations on a heavier scale than had been possible during recent weeks. attacks on enemy shipping were continued by day and by night.Enemy activity against this country continued at a low level.In Malaya and Burma attacks by Japanese aircraft were directed against,our aerodromes, several of which were evacuated.In Libya our aircraft provided effective support for our ground forces, andheavily attacked enemy communications.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.48. Bomber Command despatched 34 sorties. Lighter Command flew 57sorties against shipping and over occupied territory. Attacks on shipping are reported under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;49. Three Coastal Command Beauforts bombed the Donges oil refinery at st.. Nazaire, starting fires among oil containers. Spitfires carried out promisingattacks on barges at Nieuport and on two railway trains near Calais.Night.50. Bomber Command despatched 548 sorties and dropped a total of 553 tonsof H.E. bombs and 22,380 incendiaries. Our aircraft operated every night exceptone, the principal objectives being the enemy warships at Brest, the docks and town of Wilhelmshaven, and Channel ports.51. Brest was attacked on six nights by a total of 167 aircraft, which dropped 277 tons of H.E. bombs, including nine of 4,000 lbs. and 39 of 2,000 lbs.A number of these were seen to burst in the dock area and one 4,000-lb. bombcaused a particularly large explosion, followed by a red glow; a number of fires were also reported, but intense darkness and efficient smoke screens made itimpossible to observe whether the battle cruisers were hit.52. Seventy-one tons of H.E. bombs (including three of 4,000 lbs.) and10,600 incendiaries were dropped on Wilhelmshaven during a raid by 69 bombers.Numerous fires resulted, and bomb-bursts were seen near the main railway station and the docks and in the North-Eastern and the Western parts of thetown.53. Attacks on a lighter scale were made against Ostend, Havre,Cherbourg and Cologne.United Kingdom.54.   Fighter Command flew 1,436 sorties by day and 532 sorties by night.Enemy operations were on a small scale, comparable with those of theprevious week.   An insignificant number of aircraft penetrated inland.Coastal Operations.55. Coastal Command flew 228 patrols (362 sorties) and provided 33 convoy escorts (76 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Commandtotalled 506 (1,259 sorties).56. Hudsons sank a 1,200-ton ship off Haugesund, and reported hits on an,000-ton merchant vessel off Texel and another of 4,000 tons off Ameland.-Beauforts and Beaufighters, escorted by long-range Spitfires, attacked a convoy off the Dutch coast; a Flak ship was hit and other ships damaged.57. Thirty-five aircraft were despatched to lay sea-mines off Brest and inthe Jade and Weser rivers; ten of these operated by day.58.   The results of enemy operations against shipping were negligible,apart from minelaying, which cannot yet be assessed.   Four attacks on shipping[23267] D
were reported during the week; one off Milford Haven and another off the shetlands by day, one at dusk off Spurn Head and the fourth by a F.W. 200 oft&apos;Portugal.Mediterranean.Cyrenaica.59. mary lands, Blenheims, and Hurricane bombers operated in close supportof our ground forces, though on some days their activities were curtailed by sandstorms and unfavourable weather conditions. Concentrations of enemy M.T. nearEl Tmimi were bombed and attacks were made on motor vehicles on the Bomba- jjDerna road and on the road north of El Tmimi; many direct hits were observed.An attack, carried out by six Bostons in poor weather, was intercepted by12 Me. 109s, and five Bostons failed to return and the sixth was badly damaged.60. By the 16th December there was a considerable movement of enemyM.T. to the north-west of El Tmimi in the direction of Derna and beyond;repeated air attacks were carried out, and concentrations of vehicles in the Mekiliarea were bombed, many vehicles being hit and set on fire.Reconnaissance disclosed a congestion of aircraft on the aerodromes in theBenghazi area, doubtless due to the fact that the enemy has lost at least sixaerodromes since the campaign started. mary lands attacked Binina aerodromeand destroyed two large aircraft and started some fires, and on the 17th Decemberthe landing ground at Barce was bombed and fifteen Ju. 52s were destroyed.61. Fighters carried out continuous defensive and offensive patrols and provided escorts for bombers. During the earlier part of the week these patrols were largely over the Tobruk-El Gazala area. Many successful engagementswere fought.62. On the 11th December 24 Ju. 88s, with an escort of 10 Me. 109s, made an attack on the Tobruk area; they were intercepted by a patrol of Tomahawkswhich shot down two of the bombers and two of the escorting fighters; the samepatrol then attacked six Me. 109s, three of which they destroyed. One Tomahawkwas shot down.On the two following days our fighters, whilst carrying out offensive sweepsand escorts, shot down 20 enemy aircraft and probably destroyed eight others,against our loss of 12 fighters. On the 15th and 16th December only two enemy aircraft were sighted, one of which was shot down.63. The difficulties of supply by sea forced the Germans to rely largely on air transport, and on the 11th and 12th December an effort was made to interceptthe Ju. 52s flying between Crete and Derna, as a result of which mary lands andBeaufighters destroyed 7, and damaged 13 others; 5 mary lands are missing.64. Hurricanes operating from forward landing grounds made a series of attacks on enemy transport vehicles on the road between Ghemines (37 miles south of Benghazi) and El Agheila. During these attacks 173 vehicles, including12 petrol tankers, were damaged or destroyed, and numerous casualties wereinflicted.65. On two nights a total of 35 Wellingtons successfully attacked Dernatown and aerodrome. Two night raids were also made on Benghazi harbour bya total of 14 Wellingtons from Malta. Hits were seen on buildings near the harbour, in the centre of the town and at the base of the outer mole. Duringone of the attacks the harbour was mined by four further Wellingtons.66. Enemy air operations continued on an intensive scale but the activity of dive-bomber units noticeably decreased. This may have been partly due tolosses inflicted by our air forces on these units during the previous week andpartly to supply difficulties. The reduced activity of dive-bomber units wascounterbalanced to some extent by an increased activity of Ju. 88 bombers. Theseconcentrated mainly on fro.nt-line targets and there was a noticeable absence of attacks on back areas and communications.German single-engined fighter units have been employed to the utmost. In thecourse of engagements with our fighters many Me. 109s have been shot down, butgenerally speaking, the German single-engined fighters have been handled well.
Tripolitania.67. Castel Benito aerodrome and M.T. in the Zuara area were attacked by aircraft from Malta. At Castel Benito three aircraft on the ground were destroyed and large fires were caused among the hangars. Two buildings andtwo petrol tankers were destroyed in the Zuara area.Italy and Sicily.68. On the night of the 15th/16th December and on the following night, atotal of 32 Wellingtons attacked naval shipping at Taranto; hits were made inthe target area and considerable damage was caused to naval buildings and stores,but an effective smoke screen prevented detailed observation. In an attack onCatania harbour one merchant vessel of 6,000 tons was set on fire and one or twohits were made on another ship of 5,000 tons. Naval Swordfish are believed tohave sunk off Kelibia in Tunis a tanker of 4,000 tons in a night attack.A day attack was also made on the aerodrome at Comiso (Sicily), and amunition factory at Cotrone was hit twice.Malta.69. Enemy night fighter Ju. 88s operating from Sicily have attacked Maltaby night, but although some of the raids continued for many hours, the numberof aircraft operating has not been large and little damage has been caused.Greece and Crete.70. Wellingtons attacked Patras at night and dropped 17^ tons of bombs;the quayside buildings were demolished, and it is believed that a 12,000-ton linerwas hit, as much smoke was observed coming from her stern.In daylight Blenheims carried out four attacks on shipping at Argostoli; onemerchant vessel of 5,000 tons was possibly hit, but intense A.A. fire was encountered and four Blenheims are missing.On the night 11th/12th December 20 Wellingtons bombed Maleme, obtaining a direct hit on a petrol dump and causing a number of large fires and explosions.Russia.German Air Force Operations.71. The German Air Force appears to have had little effect in holding upthe Russian advances on almost all sectors of the front, but there is little indica-tion as to the air operations which have been carried out. It is thought probable,however, that close support units which were at very advanced bases in the Klin-Kalinin sector have been forced to withdraw in face of Russian progress in this area. On the whole of the Central Front German Air Force supplies generally are believed to be adequate to meet the present requirements of the reduced airforces in this area.72. In the south, Russian pressure appears to be heaviest in the DonetzBasin, but the commitments of the German Air Force in support of the Crimeaoperations and the line at present held along the River Mius to the north ofTaganrog seem to preclude the possibility of an adequate air force to coveroperations further north. The supply situation in the whole of this area east ofthe Dnieper bend is thought for some time to have been acute, and probablyaccounts for the failure hitherto to maintain air operations on an intensive scale.The Far East.Burma.73. On the 11th, formations of 16 and 23 aircraft made two raids on ouraerodrome at Tavoy, 225 miles S.E. of Rangoon.

The following nighf further alarmsoccurred but no raid developed,(ii) Pearl Harbour. Although information regarding the aircraft which took part in the attacks on Pearl Harbour is scanty, the indications iare that they came from at least two aircraft carriers, which mayhave included the Shokaku and Zuikaku.
