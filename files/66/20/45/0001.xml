c9 C*4 VThe Secretary of State for Dominions Affairs has&apos; been inconsultation with me about the Canadian financial offerexplained in Ottawa telegrams 17 and 23.2*      Our sterling liability to Canada as at 30th November,1941, was  ml620    This is being added to, each month, to theextent of ever  m20,  or say at the rate of  m250 a year.30      Canada proposes to deal with the sterling debt as atthe 30th November by converting it into a Canadian dollar loan,to be free of interest during the war and to be secured bypledging the Canadian securities held in the United Kingdom, thevalue of which is taken as approximately  ml55.    During the war we would pay off this loan at the rate of about  mlO a year which is taken as the interest on the pledged securities.    TheGovernment are not asked to take over the ownership of thepledged securities as in the-case of the American Reconstroution.Finance Corporation loan and the owners would be free to sell by arrangement with our Exchange Control and the Exchange Controlof Canadaa40      Canada would repatriate the remaining Government and canadian National Railway securities, amounting to about  m65,and would make us a &quot;gift&quot; amounting to  m222.      It is estimatedthat this would meet our requirements up to some time early 4^1943.      In addition Canada would purchase our interest inCanadian war plants estimated at  m50 and might assume full responsibility for all the Royal Canadian Air Force squadrons in the United Kingdom, which includes a capital sum of  m20 and -are current amount of  26m (or more) a year.5.      No final decision in regard to all these points has yet been reached by the Canadian Government, but we are askedto give our views at once as the Canadian Prime Minister wishes to make a formal statement ^towards the end of this week,60      The Canadian Minister of Finance briefly mentioned the outline of these proposals to the Prime Minister when hewas in Ottawa and Mr, Churchill, we understand, expressed warmappreciation of the dollar &quot;gift&quot; proposed, but the canadian minister of Finance did not have time to tell Mr.  Churchill ofthe proposals in full0-1-jg DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT&apos;)&quot;TO be KEPT Un&quot;deFlOC^a1Td1cEY!^ ^ It is requested that special care may betaken toj^E C R E T. ensure the secrecy of this document.V7.P.

The broad conception out of which the offejr-flows^As-....that there is a great inter-Governmental debt which must bepaid and that there will be great accretions to that debt inthe future also to be paid,  except so far as they are offset by a money gift.    The idea-&apos;of eliminating the &quot;money sign&quot;and of thinking of common contributions of goods and services to the defeat of a common foe (v/ho is now threatening theshe:, es of the Dominions as well as of this country) is not present,    I have no doubt that for the moment we must acton this general conception which has so far held the field,but I co not think our acceptance of the offer, which covers the past and a limited period into the future, should gowithout a hint that some new conception of the CommonwealthEffort as a whole must in the new conditions soon take its place,Object to this, we should in my view accept theproposal that the Canadian sterling balance of  ml55 shouldbe converted into a Canadian dollar loan, bearing no interestduring the war and repayable during the war at the rate ofabout  mlO a year or 6% of the original total,     (if interestand early repayment is claimed after the war, it may representa burden beyond our powers but that must, I think, be left&quot;for later settlement, )But the suggestion that the U,K,  Government should give collateral security in respect of a loan to us by another Empire Government comes as a shock to me.    It istrue,  of course,  that with the authority of Parliament we gave collateral security to the Reconstruction finance corporation (a&apos;serai-government body) for the recent dollarloan, but not only was the U,  S.A,  a foreign country (andone to whom we were in default) but it was also a non-belligerent country,  and the Reconstruction Finance Corpgrationis a quasi-commercial body which always obtains the best possible security before granting loans.    It may be that theCanadian proposal has been formed a little unthinkingly onthis model, but it is quite unprecedented for any BritishEmpire Government to give collateral to another Empire country.It&quot;would surely be seriously damaging to the Commonwealthconception:    it would certainly reflect seriously on ourcredit and set a dangerous precedent&apos;both for ourselves andother Empire countries which may borrow either during or after the war.7,      We could not pledge securities held by investorsin the United Kingdom as collateral without obtaining a specialAct of Parliament,  as we had to do for the ReconstructionFinance Corporation Loan, since our power to requisition suchsecurities &quot;in   -v;u;o   pf . need rests on the Defence (Finance)Regulations which will expire at the end of the war,8.      The securities which we are asked to pledge includevery large holdings &apos;   y 7     Imperial Chemical,-.industries,Imperial Tobacco and international Nickel in the securities of&apos;their business associates in Canada,    The idea that under certain circumstances these firms should be forced to part with their Canadian securities (and this idea is implicit inpledging the securities as collateral) would be very disturbingto the business community here and the Government might wellbe criticised also by those who regard such close businessconnections as of the greatest value as a link between canada and this country.

9W      There is another quite separate hut ver^y^practicalnatter to which we cannot close our eyes.    If we pledgedcollateral security for Canada we should he asked later onto do the same thing for South Africa and India.    NeitherSouth Africa nor India is anxious to hold sterling, hut once they have repatriated their sterling securities it will heessential that they should hold very large sums of sterlingas part of their contributions to the common war,    We have ofcourse very large interests indeed in business enterprises,mines, etc ,  in these Dominions and it would he an impossible position if the Government had to go back to Parliament inthe case of each of these Dominions and ask for powers toenable the Government to pledge our business interests there as security for loans representing the contribution which theDominions are making to winning the ware100      The Secretary of State-for the Dominions and I agreethat our reply to Canada must be in cordial terms and, while making clear our objection to giving collateral security,must leave no doubt of our appreciation, of the generosityof the offerello If the Cabinet agree with this general line, theSecretary of State for the Dominions and I will agree uponthe necessary communication to the High Commissioner,Treasury, S.Wp le7th January,   1942c
