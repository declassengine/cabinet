3. oTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.SECRET. I Copy No.W.P. (41) 293.November 29, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.INDIA.RELEASE  OF  SATYAGRAHI PRISONERS.BY direction of the Prime Minister the following telegrams are circulated for the consideration of the War Cabinet.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES,Secretary of the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.W. 1,November 29, 1941.Telegram from Prime Minister to Viceroy, dated November 26, 194i.(Personal, Private and Secret.)I am sure it would be a mistake to make a flag-day out of this very smallunwelcomed gesture of conciliation. I had hoped the matter could be dealt withby smooth administration through your personal influence upon and contact withprovincial governors. Your own convictions Were against the policy on merits.Hallett&apos;s and.Hope&apos;s grave arguments remain unanswered. The extraordinarypowers accorded to the Central Government to deal with war emergencies arenow to be used to override the independence of the provinces in their respdnsi-bility for law and order. This is a sad contrariety, and I wish I had been keptbetter informed before you reached the position now disclosed. If you consider astatement inevitable, it would be better couched in a modest tone, something-like this : &apos;&quot; In view of the complete failure and collapse of the Satyagrahimovement and the&quot; expiry of the great bulk of the sentences imposed, theGovernment of India hold the view that throughout India it should bepossible to expedite the release of prisoners whose offences have been merely of a formal character and without serious harmful intent. Although in someprovinces like the United Provinces the numbers concerned and localconditions may cause some delay, it is hoped that practically all the ordinarydemonstrators may be released by the end of the year.&quot;Let me know by return whether this sort of announcement would meet yourdifficulty and please suggest any alteration in the wording which you may think necessary.[23205]
Telegram from Viceroy to Prime Minister, dated November 27, 1941.(Immediate.)3020-S. Personal and secret. Following for Prime Minister : Your personal and secret message. I have, of course, given most earnest attention to your views and those of Cabinet. But I am clear that, while numbers are small, and weshall get no thanks, issue is now immediate one of first-class political importance on which public attention is concentrated, and which cannot be disposed ofprivately between Governors and Governor-General, or between Government ofIndia and Governments. Nor can it be settled between Viceroy personally andPrime Minister or Cabinet. My Council must (? pronounce) in here on finalarrangement, and there must, I am perfectly certain, be a public announcement.2. Terms of that announcement must be approved by my Council. It is fully seized of whole issue, and could not be kept out in any case, since centralareas are involved.3. The prestige and position of expanded Council are vitally affected bydecision. I have with very great difficulty kept them together and quiet during these last few days, but risk of resignations if they are over-ruled is too seriousto be faced. Its effect here would be disastrous; and press comment from homesuggests that it would not go well there, or as enemy propaganda either.4. I see no prospect of my Council accepting your draft as it stands. my immediately succeeding telegram contains a possible alternative, which I amready to try on them. I cannot guarantee its acceptance, but I will do my best,and with some hope of success.5. I am not unduly fussed by views of Hallett and Hope. Policy of gradualrelease will help Hallett. We have got to face the other issues involved. As for control of provinces by me or by Centre, its importance emerges at once if youreverse position, and we were dealing with a provincial desire to release menwhom I or Cabinet wanted retained.(3)Telegram from Viceroy to Prime Minister, dated November 27, 1941.3021-S. Following is alternative draft I suggest for your consideration :The Government of India (? in consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government),*confident of determination of all responsible opinion in India to support war effort until victory is secured, have reached conclusion that those civil disobedienceprisoners whose offences have been formal or symbolic in character can now be set free. Effect will be given to this course as soon as possible. There are provincesin which numbers and local conditions may mean delay. But before end of theyear the Government of India hope that throughout India practically all such persons will have been set free. With them there will be released also MaulviAbul Kalam Azad and Pandit Jawahar t,al Nehru.* Note. Query and brackets telegraphed by India do not indicate doubtful decyphering.
