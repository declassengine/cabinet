THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  December 1941.MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (41) 298.December 6, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDERTOOK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.RUSSIA.Directive from the Prime Minister to the Foreign Secretary.(Circulated, by direction of the Prime Minister, for the informationof the &quot;War Cabinet.)THE prolongation of the battle in Libya, which is drawing in so manyAxis resources, will probably require the use both of the 50th and 18th divisions which we had hoped might be available for the defence of the Caucasus or for action on the Russian front. In the near future, therefore, these Divisions cannotbe considered available. The best form which our aid can take (apart fromsupplies) is the placing of a strong component of the Air Force, say 10 squadrons,on the southern flank of the Russian armies; where among other things they can help protect the Russian naval bases on the Black Sea. These squadrons will be withdrawn from the Libyan battle at the earliest moment when success has been gained. The movement of their ground personnel and stores will not unduly chokethe Trans-Persian communications, as would be the case if Infantry divisions were sent. The High Command in the Middle East have been ordered to makeplans for this movement, the completion of which will, of course, depend upon thefacilities afforded for detailed reconnaissance.2. The attitude of Turkey becomes increasingly important, both to Russiaand to Great Britain.   The Turkish army of 50 divisions requires Air support.[23235]
we have promised a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 12 fighter squadrons to turkey in the event of Turkey being attacked. In this event we might requireto withdraw some of the squadrons proposed to be sent into action on the Russiansouthern front. The best use of our aircraft on both shores of the Black sea and the types to be employed require to be decided according to circumstancesby consultation between the British and Russian Governments and Staffs.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,December 6, 1941.
