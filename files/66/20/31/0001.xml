The german submarine strength is estimated to be increasing by about 20 a month and it is becoming increasingly difficult for convoys to avoid beingsighted.      Once the convoy has been sighted, the U-boat has a ;sufficient excess of speed over the convoy to maintain touch withoutdifficultv, and then &quot;home on&quot; all other U-boats in the vicinity.The thread is bound to become much more serious as the number of operational U-boats increases, and in the end it may be necessaryfor convoys to fight their way through.2Q      The Germans have developed a very effective technique,using long range aircraft to direct U-boats to our convoys.      the chances of successful evasion therefore largely depend on the degreeof vigour with which the enemy air reconnaissance can be countered.This can be done to a limited extent by single aircraft carried onthe merchant ships themselves;    but the protection afforded will bemuch greater if the convoy escort includes an aircraft carrier ableto operate a number of aircraft.3.      Moreover, experience has demonstrated most clearly that the role of aircraft in trade protection is by no means limited to thefrustration of enemy air reconnaissance.      They are invaluable for direct attack on U-boats at sea.     With the   development of the anti-submarine patrols of Coastal Command the U-boats have been drivenfurther and further away from the shores of the United Kingdom.      Inthe North Western Approaches during October, 1940, the U-boats were operating regularly to within 100 miles of our coast;    now they arerarely operating within 400 miles.      It will be obvious at once thatconvoy protection would be immeasurably improved if each convoy could have with it aircraft capable of effective attack on any U-boats sighted.Such aircraft could only be operated usefully from a carrier accompanyingthe convoy.     A mobile air umbrella of this kind might well be the chiefmeans of preventing disastrous losses in convoys which have to fighttheir way through U-boat concentrations.4.      One such instance has already occurred.      When the lasthomeward bound Gibraltar convoy (H.G. 76) was sailed from Gibraltar,a large concentration of U-boats was known to be in the area.     Onthe first morning out, aircraft from the small auxiliary carrierAUDACITY, accompanying the convoy,  located a U-boat shadowing from 22miles away.      The aircraft directed the surface escort on to thesubmarine, which was destroyed:    The next day 2 Focke-Wulfs homingU-boats on to the convoy were driven off, and the same day anotherU-boat was located and destroyed by the surface escort.      The convoy was attacked during that night and one escort was sunk, but the U-boatconcerned was also destroyed.     During the next two days, aircraft fromAUDACITY attacked the shadowing Focke-Wulfs, shooting down two and seriously damaging a third, and on two occasions sighted two U-boats.On the second occasion one of the latter was seen to be damaged and tohe transferring her crew to her consort;    these submarines were attacked and casualties were inflicted on the exposed personnel.

Unfortunately a determined attack on the convoy that night resultedin the torpedoing of AUDACITY and a merchant ship.      AUDACITY was asmall carrier carrying fighter aircraft, armed only with machine guns,and because of her size could not operate aircraft by night.      Yet sheffas responsible in ft days for the destruction of 2 enemy aircraftcertain and 1 probable, largely responsible for the destruction of onesubmarines, and for d-riving off several other attacks by submarines and aircraft.      Without her, the convoy might well have sufferedcatastrophic losses.      An earlier H.G.  convoy (H.G.  73) without carrierprotection, lost 9 merchant ships when similarly beset by U-boats.5.      Apart from the requirements of trade protection, the needfor aircraft carriers has grown more urgent and vital with the developments of the la3t few weeks.      Our general commitments at seahave vastly increased by the spread of the war to the s eas hithertovirtually immune, and at a time when the Navy has another powerful fleetadded to its opponents, we have suffered severe losses in capital ships..To cover the greater area of sea warfare now opened up, and to fill thegaps created by the loss of our heavy ships, we shall have to rely moreand more on aircraft carriers.6.      It must be assumed, too, that the future course of the warIwill provide increasing scope for combined operations and that aircover will become more and more important for their success.      Oftenjsuch air support will only be possible by the use of aircraft carriers.7.      As long ago!mentioned above couldwould require a total&apos; and on trade routes.as 1936 - before some of the developmentsbe foreseen - the Admiralty estimated that it of 30 aircraft carriers for work with the fleet at present we have 4 armoured and 4 unarmouredcarriers.      One armoured carrier should come into service in 1943 andone in 19449 but after that no further first line carriers will becompleted before 1946c8.      To make up our deficiencies, we can only look to auxiliary,aircraft carriers.      To meet the expanded requirements set out&apos; in theprevious paragraphs, 34 of these are needed and they should be in service as soon as possible.      This can only be done by convertingmerchant ships which are already built or building.      I can see noother way of remedying this serious situation.      A satisfactory typecan be provided by a diesel-engined merchant ship of about 16 knotspeed which can take a flight deck of 450 ft.  in length and 60 ft,  in[breadth.      The success of this  type of craft can^be gauged by the achievements of the AUDACITY, which in addition to her work with convoyH.G. 76 mentioned above, has accounted for a further 4 enemy aircraft(making 7 in all)  :    on at least one occasion the destruction of an aircraft prevented a submarine attack developing on the convoy.9.     Six auxiliary..c.arriers are being converted for us in theUnited Stated under Lease-Lend.      The United States authorities have^been asked to provide a further nine ships of the same type.      Theyhave replied that they agree as to the necessity for these carriers for trade protection and are requisitioning 24suitable ships for the purpose,but that they are unabTe to earmark any of these specifically for our use.10.I Convert asIguj? own returned die requirWat the calso be susame time.ni,ght, and aircraft eTo redress the unsatisfactory situation thus created, we mustmany ships into auxiliary aircraft carriers as we can from sources.      I therefore propose that six more ships which meetements should be converted at home as soon as possible, andonversion of twjL,of the WINCHESTER CASTLE type, which willitable for combined operations,  should be put in hand at theThese carriers will be capable of operating aircraft by, in addition to fighter aircraft, will carry reconnaissancequipped with special devices for the detection of U-boats.\  11.      This will not meet the Admiralty requirements in full, and Ishould feel bound to press for more but for the scarcity of merchantI^hips 0f -the type in question.      I realise that the Minister of War&quot;transport will find it difficult to agree even to this limited proposal,

jannot emphasize too strongly that by taking a short viewn0W   we shall almost certainly be prejudicing ultimate success in theRattle of the Atlantic.      Enemy attack on our*trade has been severe inthe past, hut we must expect that the U-boat war will he greatly more severe next year.     E^ght ships taken from trade for conversion intoaircraft carriers now may well save very great losses of merchanttonnage within the next two years.A.
