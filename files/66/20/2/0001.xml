THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT;Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.MOST SECRET. NjCopy No. 29W.P. (41) 280.November 20, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SUPPLEMENTARY NEW CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME, 1941.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.I. Programme and Policy.IN submitting the New Construction Programme approved in April 1941,I deferred decisions on the construction of Capital Ships, Aircraft Carriers and heavy Cruisers approved in earlier programmes, until after a review of theposition in September. I also stated that a supplementary estimate would benecessary to cover additional small craft, the number and types depending on theexperience gained during the Spring and Summer of 1941.2. A review of naval requirements and of the capacity available has nowbeen completed, and I accordingly submit my proposals to the War Cabinet.3. The 1941 Programme was severely curtailed by the requirement that over one million gross tons of Merchant Shipping should be built a year and by thehigh priority given to the repair of warships and merchant ships. Generoushelp in repair work has been afforded by the United States, but our ships have suffered considerable damage in action in the Eastern Mediterranean. on balance there is little extra labour available for naval construction.4.   The proposed supplementary programme for 1941 is : 3 6-inch Cruisers.7 Flower Class Corvettes.6 Trawlers.40 72-foot Harbour Defence Motor Launches.60 110-foot Fairmile Launches Type D.
48 110-foot Fairmile Launches Type B.8 71-foot Motor Gun Boats.66 Motor Minesweepers.20 Assault Landing Craft.20 Heavy Support Craft..127 Tank Landing Craft.22 &quot;Z&quot; Craft.1 Floating Dock.2 Tugs.3 Salvage Vessels.5. In addition, I propose to proceed with the 16-inch gun mountings of oneCapital Ship [Lion) so that it can be laid down in 1942. It is intended to start the construction of the Aircraft Carrier authorised in the 1940 programme.I propose that work on the gun mountings of one heavy 8-inch cruiser should begin so that the ship can be laid down in 1942.6. In submitting the original 1941 programme I gave particulars of ships which it was hoped to obtain from the U.S.A. under Lease-Lend. The position has now been clarified, and the following is a revised list of ships for whichrequisitions have been accepted by the United States Navy Authorities for construction in the U.S.A. or Canada under the Lease-Lend Act. A number ofthese ships must await further allocation of funds under future appropriationsbefore orders can actually be placed.To be built in U.S.A.100 Convoy Escorts.7 Tank Assault Ships.6 Auxiliary Aircraft Carriers (Conversions).32 Minesweepers (A.M.100 type).30 Minesweepers (Y.M.S. type).14 Rescue Tugs.4 Steel Salvage Vessels.6 Wooden Salvage Vessels.5 Small Salvage Vessels.32 Motor Torpedo Boats (Vosper design).20 Motor Torpedo Boats (Elco type).100 36-ft. Eureka Boats.31 Air Sea Rescue Boats.3 Floating Docks.24 72-ft. Motor Launches (within the numbers approved in the 1941Programme to be built in the United Kingdom).In addition it is hoped that the United States will accept requisitionsfor two repair ships which are required to provide repair and refit facilities abroad in connection with the new floatingdocks.
To be built in Canada.10 Twin Screw Corvettes.15 Single Screw Corvettes.16 Trawlers.15 Minesweepers.8 Fairmile Launches B type.7. Of the 28 M.T.Bs. and M.G.Bs., which I reported that the United StatesGovernment had agreed to release from the United States Navy, it has only beenpossible for 22 to be delivered. In addition, however, the United States Govern-ment have released 2 Submarines of 1917-18 design, and have agreed to releaseup to a further 16 Submarines should the trials of the first two prove satisfactory.II. Analysis of Programme by Classes.Capital Ships.8. Three ships of the King George V Class are now in service, Anson andHoive are due to complete in April and October of 1942 respectively. Vanguardis expected to be ready in 1944. When laying the 1941 New construction programme before the War Cabinet I undertook to reconsider in September the resumption of work on the Lion and Temeraire (1938 programme) and theconstruction of Conqueror and Thunderer (1939 programme).9. Of the 16 Capital Ships we now have in service, seven have not beenmodernised and are deficient in gun range, protection, speed and endurance. Italyand Japan have modernised all their capital ships and all German ships may beclassed as modern. At the end of 1943 we shall have eleven new or modernisedcapital ships against the eleven new or modernised capital ships of Germanyand Italy. On our side five will be new ships. The enemy will possess five newbattleships and two new battle cruisers and may possibly enjoy the addition of four French capital ships to his fleet.10. In this situation our strength would be hardly sufficient for themaintenance of the command of the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Our prepon-derance will depend on a margin of 7 old and unmodernised battleships. It would greatly diminish if the war spread to the Far East. In any event in 1943 the older ships will be 27 years old and the continuation of their life in service cannotbe relied upon for much after that. For these reasons provision must be madefor at least the maintenance of our relative capital ship strength.11. Work on the gun mountings has to begin some months before a capital ship is laid down. Capacity has not been available to date to proceed with themanufacture of heavy gun mountings. It is not, therefore, possible to include the resumption of work on a capital ship in the Supplementary Programme. Thisspecialised type of skilled labour is now available, and I propose that work on three triple 16-inch turrets of the Lion should now be started so that she can belaid down in 1942.
Aircraft-Carriers.12. Four armoured carriers are now commissioned. Two more, Implacableand Indefatigable, will complete in 1943. The 1940 Supplementary Programmeauthorised by the War Cabinet made provision for one aircraft-carrier whichwas to be considered early in 1941. Because of the shortage of shipbuilding-labour, I could not undertake to lay it down until after the review which has nowbeen completed.13. This year&apos;s operations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean have givenstriking evidence of the value of carrier-borne aircraft in finding and fixing theenemy and in providing air protection for our forces operating in narrow waters.If aircraft-carriers are to assume a more offensive role in operations, they willbe subjected to the risk of casualties. Our only chance of providing replacementsis to put the work of new construction in hand now. Four of our carriers are ofan obsolete type and will soon be approaching the end of their lives. I proposenow to proceed with the construction of the carrier which is outstanding.Cruisers.14.   Our total requirement of cruisers is still considered to be :  Heavy Cruisers   ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      20Medium Cruisers...      ...       ...       ...       ...      40Small Cruisers    ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      40Total100of which 15 may be over-age. Present programmes will give us in June 1943 thefollowing cruiser strength, disregarding further loss : Heavy Cruisers, 8-inch guns andUnder-.  Over-age,      age.      Total. Building.above     ...      ......... 14       Nil 14       NilMedium   Cruisers :    Guns   below8-inch, displacement over 6,000tons......       ...       .....        26 4 30 3- Small Cruisers:  Guns, 6-inch orbelow,     displacement     below6,000&apos;tons        ...       ...... 18 15 33 15819774The over-age cruisers are the Hawkins, &quot; C,&quot; &quot; D &quot;&apos; and &quot; E &quot; Classes. Theyare approaching the end of their life. They lack range, endurance and A.A.armament.
15. In the operations at Crete our cruiser force sustained heavy casualties.In all, we have lost five cruisers in 1941. We are faced with the necessity of protecting a large number of valuable convoys on long ocean voyages, and any extension of the war will bring heavy commitments in the Pacific and IndianOceans.16. I am anxious to proceed with the construction of the four 8-inch cruisers deferred from the 1940 Supplementary Programme, but capacity forthe gun mountings is only now becoming available. I propose to proceed withthe construction of three triple 8-inch turrets, with a view to laying down, as early as may be possible in 1942, one of the four 8-inch cruisers already approved.I also ask for approval to lay down three additional 6-inch cruisers of the modified &quot; Fiji&quot; Class.Corvettes.17. Our need for convoy escorts in the Atlantic is still pressing. Theextension of submarine activity to the Far East and Indian Ocean would raisefurther heavy requirements. It is not possible with the building slips availableto lay down any of the larger Twin-Screw Corvettes and only seven smallerSingle-Screw Corvettes of the &quot; Flower &quot; Class can be undertaken in additionto previous programmes.   I include seven &quot; Flower &quot; Class in this programme.18. The United States Government have agreed to supplement our outputby the construction under the Lease-Lend Act of 100 vessels in U.S.A. and25 in Canada.Trawlers.19. Our need for modern trawlers for anti-submarine and minesweepingwork is still great. No more can be taken from the fishing industry. Nine havebeen sent to Russia. I said in April last that it would only be possible to build9 in 1941. However, it is now expected that we shall be able to build six more,and I ask for approval to include six in this programme.72-ft. Harbour Defence Motor Launches.20. These are asdic-fitted launches designed to patrol harbours andanchorages and to maintain the watch on the booms and loops.Recent attacks have demonstrated the need for these craft in the defenceof our bases and there are urgent demands from both home and oversea commands.I ask for authority to lay down forty in this programme.110-ft. Fairmile Launches.21. The modified 110-ft. M.L. referred to in the 1941 Programme knownas the &quot;D&quot; type is a high-speed launch with four engines. These craft, armed with torpedoes, are suitable -for offensive operations against enemy coastal
shipping, and, armed with guns, will be operated to counter enemy E-Boats. ^Sixty are included in the Supplementary Programme.22. The construction of the &quot; B &quot; type (a two-engined launch) has proceededsatisfactorily. The &quot; B &quot; type is fitted with asdics and is now employed primarily on the following duties : (i) To attack enemy submarines in an area up to 300 miles from the MX.Base.(ii) To escort coastal convoys as protection from submarine, E.-Boat andair attack.(iii) To patrol the near approaches to our ports and harbours.A number of these boats are now coming into service on the South and EastCoasts, where, in addition to performing the above duties, they will constitute an anti-invasion force which may well be invaluable.Forty-eight &quot; B &quot; type Launches are included to provide for outstandingrequirements both at home and overseas.23. The question of how far the Fairmile organisation can help the heavy bomber Programme is being considered with the Ministry of Aircraft.Production. This investigation may show that, in order to attain a high produc-tion of Heavy Bombers, some reduction in the Naval Building of FairmileLaunches, and hence a lower rate of production, may be advisable. Meanwhile,however, I ask for approval for the full programme, on the understanding thatthe Admiralty will do their best to assist the Heavy Bomber Programme, if thisproves possible.71-Ft. Motor Gun Boats.24. The 71-ft. Motor Gun Boat embodies the general characteristics of theearlier high-speed Motor Boats of light construction. It has the capacity for very high speed in calm weather, and this is the attribute, combined with itsarmament of 20-mm. and 40-mm. guns, which will enable it to kill the E-Boat ifweather conditions are favourable.Material has been collected and engines are available for the eight boatswhich I include in this programme. I confine the proposals to this numberbecause the occasions on which the weather and sea permit boats of light construc-tion developing their high speed are limited, and we have, for this reason, adopted the more seaworthy but slower &quot; D &quot; type Fairmile for our main Anti-E-Boatforces.Motor Minesweepers.25.   These craft are required to maintain the security of our ports andchannels against magnetic ground mines..   I include 66 in this programme.Landing Craft.26. Full investigation as to the numbers and design of landing craft of all types required for combined operations on a large scale is to be an early task of
the new Inter-Service Committee on combined operations. A preliminary-assessment of the requirements leads me to the conclusion that the constructionshould now be augmented on the following scale : 27. Motor Landing Craft. With Treasury approval we are now buildingthese at the rate of 5 a month, which is sufficient at present to meet requirements,and I make no proposals in this programme for additional craft.28. Assault Landing Craft. With Treasury approval this type of vessel isbeing built at the rate of 8 a month. I propose to increase this rate to 12 amonth, involving orders for 20 additional vessels up to the end of March 1942.29. Heavy Support Craft. I propose to order 15 vessels of this typeforthwith and thereafter to place orders at the rate of 1 a month. The totalnumber expected to be ordered up to the end of March 1942 is 2030. Tank Landing Craft. In the 1941 Programme provision was made for120 lengthened T.L.Cs., this being the maximum number it was expected to beable to order during the year. Capacity has already been found, however, forthis number and, as a total of about 300 T.L.Cs. of all types are our estimated requirements, it is desired to continue production at the rate of some 20 T.L.Cs.a month, involving additional orders up to the end of March 1942 of 120 vessels.If capacity in India can be found, I also propose to order 7 T.L.Cs. and 22 &quot; Z &quot;craft for the Middle East, in addition to 10 T.L.Cs. for which Treasury approvalhas already been obtained.31. Further requirements. -It is possible that, as a result of the investi-gations proposed, 300 Shallow-Draft Landing Craft in addition to the above willbe required, but, pending the results of this investigation, I have made no provisionfor their construction.Floating Docks.32. The recent deterioration of the situation in the Far East has led tothe conclusion that a small floating dock capable of taking all classes of destroyersis urgently needed. I propose that it should be constructed in India. TheTreasury have already agreed.  I ask for approval to include it in this programme.Miscellaneous Vessels. &apos;33.   I include two tugs and three salvage vessels.34. Annexed hereto are financial statements showing the estimated cost ofthis programme, separately and in conjunction with previous programmes.A. V.
