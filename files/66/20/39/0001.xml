(42) 8.January 5, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.Mr. EDEN&apos;S VISIT TO MOSCOW.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith papers recording my conversations and negotiations with the Soviet Government during my visit to Moscow.2. The course of the negotiations for an Anglo-Soviet declaration or agreement is recorded in Document I annexed behind. The result of these negotiations was the Anglo-Soviet communique issued at midnight the28th/29th December, the text of which will be found at Annex X to this document.3. Documents II, III, IV, V and VI contain records of my five conversations with M. Stalin and M. Molotov in Moscow.4. At my first conversation with M. Stalin and M. Molotov on the16th December (Document II) M. Stalin set out in some detail what he consideredshould be the post-war territorial frontiers in Europe, and in particular his ideasregarding the treatment of Germany. He proposed the restoration of Austria asan independent State, the detachment of the Rhineland from Prussia as anindependent State or a protectorate, and possibly the constitution of anindependent State of Bavaria. He also proposed that East Prussia should betransferred to Poland and the Sudetenland returned to Czechoslovakia. Hesuggested that Yugoslavia should be restored and even receive certain additionalterritories from Italy, that Albania should be reconstituted as an independent state, and that Turkey should receive the Dodecanese, with possible adjustments in favour of Greece as regards islands in the ^aegean important to Greece. Turkeymight also receive certain districts in Bulgaria, and possibly also in NorthernSyria. In general the occupied countries, including Czechoslovakia and Greece,should be restored to their pre-war frontiers, and M. Stalin was prepared tosupport any special arrangements-for securing bases, &amp;o, for the United kingdom in Western European countries, e.g., France, Belgium, the Netherlands, norway and Denmark. As regards the special interests of the Soviet Union, M. Stalindesired the restoration of the position in 1941, prior to the German attack, inrespect of the Baltic States, Finland and Bessarabia. The &quot; Curzon Line &quot; should form the basis for the future Soviet-Polish frontier, and Roumania should give special facilities for bases, &amp;e, to the Soviet Union, receiving compensation fromterritory now occupied by Hungary.5. In the course of this first conversation, M. Stalin generally agreed withthe principle of restitution in kind by Germany to the occupied countries, moreparticularly in regard to machine tools, &amp;c, and ruled out money reparations asundesirable. He showed interest in a post-war military alliance between the&quot;democratic countries,&quot; and stated that the&apos; Soviet Union had no objection tocertain countries of Europe entering into a federal relationship, if they so desired.11591   [23309] b
\26. In the second conversation on the 17th December (see Document III),M. Stalin pressed for the immediate recognition by His Majesty&apos;s Government ofthe future frontiers of the U.S.S.R., more particularly in regard to the inclusionwithin the U.S.S.R. of the Baltic States and the restoration of the 1941 Finnish-Soviet frontier. He made the conclusion of any Anglo-Soviet Agreementdependent on agreement on this point. I, for my part, explained to M. Stalin thatin view of our prior undertakings to the United States Government it was quite impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to commit themselves at this stage toany post-war frontiers in Europe, although i undertook to consult His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, the United States Government and HisMajesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions on my return. This question, to which m. Stalin attached fundamental importance, was further discussed at the thirdmeeting on the 18th December.   (See Document IV.)7. At the fourth meeting, on the 20th December (see Document V), M. Stalinagreed to my proposal that I should consult His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom, the Dominion Governments and the United States Governmenton my return to the United Kingdom. He suggested that, meanwhile, the signature of any Anglo-Soviet agreements should be postponed with a view to&quot; signing a proper treaty, or two treaties,&quot; after I had been able to consult the &quot;Governments concerned .... within the next two or three weeks.&quot;M. Stalin said that he was sure that, whether the treaties were signed or not,Anglo-Soviet relations would improve with the progress of the war, which&quot; compelled many countries to discard their prejudices and preconceived views.&quot;He did not think that &quot; failure to sign the treaties now (i.e., during my Moscowvisit) should be regarded in too tragic a light. If the treaties were signed inLondon in two or three weeks&apos; time it would come to much the same thing. Ourrelations would meanwhile be based on the July Agreement, and they wouldbecome closer.&quot; At this meeting M. Stalin communicated the text of the draftcommunique which was eventually issued at midnight of the 28th/29th December.After this meeting M. Stalin was my host at a banquet attended by most of theleading political and military figures in the U.S.S.R., which lasted until 5 a.m.and was marked by the greatest cordiality.8. Document VI contains a short account of my final meeting with M. Stalinon the 22nd December, at which we took leave of one another in a very friendlyatmosphere.9. The general military situation was discussed very fully at all the aboveconversations. In addition, the Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff alsoheld certain discussions with Marshal Shaposhnikov, the Chief of the SovietGeneral Staff, which he has recorded for the information of the Chiefs of Staff.M. Stalin and the Soviet military leaders showed a sober confidence in the militarysituation, which appeared to be fully justified by recent Soviet successes. Theywere confident of being able to press the Germans further back during the winter,and of being able to withstand renewed German pressure which they expected inthe spring. As regards equipment, the Soviet Government were generallysatisfied with the position, except in regard to tanks. They were grateful for theassistance which we were rendering them, and were well-satisfied with the performance of the British tanks, more especially the &quot; Valentines.&quot; As regardsthe air, the Soviet Government were full of praise for the performance of ourHurricanes, and claimed to have achieved local- superiority on the Eastern Front.10. After my explanations, M. Stalin seemed fully to understand our inability to create a second front in Europe at the present time. He showed considerable interest in the progress of our Libyan offensive, and regarded it as most desirableto knock out Italy, on the principle that the Axis would collapse with the-destruction of its weakest link, Italy.11. As regards the Far East, M. Stalin did not consider that he was yetstrong enough to continue the campaign against Germany and also to provokehostilities with Japan. He said that he hoped by next spring to have restoredhis Far Eastern army to the strength which it had before he had been obliged todraw upon it for reinforcements in the West. He did not undertake to declare war on Japan next spring, but only to reconsider the matter then, although hewould prefer that hostilities should be opened by the Japanese, as he seemed to expect might be the case.
(Secret.)I.MEMORANDUM BY SECRETARY OF STATE ON conversations with M. STALIN, DECEMBER 16-20, 1941.Before arriving in Moscow, I communicated to M- Maisky a copy of thememorandum forming Annex I of Cabinet Paper W.P. (41) 288, Revise, and this had been studied by M. Stalin before our first meeting on the 16th December.On arrival in Moscow I also discussed with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador theDraft Declaration forming Annex II of the Cabinet paper W.P. (41) 288, Revise.. As a result of my discussion with Sir Stafford Cripps I arrived at an amendedtext of the Draft Declaration which, to meet Russian susceptibilities, I oast more in the form of an agreement (Annex I). This text I gave to M. Maisky for submission to M. Stalin before our first meeting, which was due to take place at p.m. on the 16th December. &apos;At that meeting M. Stalin indicated that what he had in mind was the signature, in Moscow, of two treaties, one dealing with military co-operationduring the war and the other with co-operation in the Peace Settlement and during the post-war period. He had prepared drafts of these, which he handed to me.   Translations of these drafts form Annexes II and III of this paper.On the following day (17th December) I discussed these two drafts and my own draft with M. Maisky. The latter accepted my explanation of why it wasimpossible to sign documents in treaty form, and we eventually agreed provision-ally on two draft agreements (Annexes IV and V) containing, as it seemed tome satisfactorily, the ideas contained in the three former drafts.These were submitted to M. Stalin before my second meeting with him,which took place at midnight, the 17th/18th December.It was at this meeting that M. Stalin said that what really interested him was the recognition of the Soviet claim to the 1941 frontiers, and a discussion ofthis point was protracted to such length that the drafts really came in for noexamination at all. It was agreed that both sides should reflect on what had passed and meet again the following evening.During the 18th December I had some further consultation with M. Maisky,but it did not seem- that there was likely to be any way out of the impasse. Inthe course of our discussion of the night before, M. Stalin had complained thatour draft of the second (post-war) agreement made no mention of frontiers.I accordingly made a redraft of Article 1 (Annex VI). Further, in view of thefact that M. Maisky seemed to find difficulty in the disavowal of &quot; aggrandise-ment&quot; in Article 4, I decided to eliminate the reference in that Article to the*tvyo &quot;principles&quot; (Annex VII).   And, as a still further. effort to make the12. M. Stalin also showed considerable interest in the possibility of a comvbined Anglo-Soviet operation in the near future against Petsamo and NorthNorway. This was discussed in detail between Lieut.-General Nye and marshal Shaposhnikov, and it was agreed that an outline plan should be prepared in Moscow in consultation with the British Military Mission for considerationby the Chiefs of Staff. If we are unable to meet this Soviet request, which was theonly one for direct military assistance made during my conversations in Moscow,our refusal may well have an unfortunate effect in regard to the Soviet decisionnext spring concerning the Far East.13. M. Stalin expressed himself as satisfied with the course of developments in Persia, and agreed that it was in our joint interest that Turkey should remainoutside the war as a buffer against further German penetration eastwards. Heeven advocated territorial offers to Turkey with a view to strengthening the determination of the Turkish Government to continue their present policy.Foreign Office, January 5, 1942.
settlement agreeable to M. Stalin, I drafted a letter (Annex VIII) which I wouldbe prepared to give him, indicating that we were prepared to contemplatediscussion of the frontier questions with the Soviet and United States Govern-ments after the agreements had been signed.On arrival at the meeting at 7 p.m. on the 18th December, I found thatM. Stalin had prepared two amendments. The first was of no great importance,consisting only in the fusion in a single article of Articles 1 and 2 of the secondagreement. But he further produced a second amendment, a redraft of Article 4(Annex IX). This, though its meaning was somewhat obscure, would appear to involve recognition of the 1941 frontiers, and, in reply to a direct question,M. Stalin admitted frankly that it did.This was clearly unacceptable to us, and, on the other hand, M. Stalinrejected the proposals that I bad made.In a final effort to find a solution, I offered to add to the first sentence of myredraft of Article 4 (see Annex VII) the words &quot; and for the security of their territories against further aggression.&quot;But not even this would satisfy M. Stalin.He was ready to sign the first (military) agreement, but this would reallyhave represented little advance from the position established by the Anglo-SovietAgreement of last July.Our next meeting was not until the evening of the 20th December. Duringthe interval I tried to see whether there was any means of evolving an acceptabletext, but I was driven to the conclusion that the gap was not to be bridged by anymere formula, and, M. Stalin having rejected the solution offered in my draft letter, I could see no prospect of signing any agreement.I went to the last meeting with a draft of a short communique, but found, on arrival, that M. Stalin was prepared with a longer and actually more satisfactoryversion (Annex X). This I had no difficulty in accepting in fact, one was almosttempted to enquire what all the trouble had been about.The conversations were carried on throughout in a frank and &quot;friendlyatmosphere, which appeared to develop into something warmer before the subsequent proceedings, beginning with a banquet at 10 p.m., drew to their closeat 5 a.m.I have no doubt that the conversations were worth the effort and time taken up by the journey. As M. Stalin himself said at our last interview : &quot; GreatBritain still has suspicions of the Soviet; the Soviet has suspicions of GreatBritain.   This meeting has done much to dispel both.&quot;A. E.December 25, 1941.Annex I.British Draft, December 16, 1941, 7 p.m.DRAFT AGREEMENT.The President of the People&apos;s Commissars of the U.S.S.R. and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Anthony Eden, representing His Majesty&apos;?Government in the United Kingdom, desiring to ensure the best co-operationbetween their respective Governments during the war, for the peace settlement and during the ensuing period of reconstruction, hereby set out the followingpoints, which have been agreed between them : 1. The two Governments jointly affirm their acceptance of the principlesof the declaration, made on the 14th August, 1941, by the President of the UnitedStates and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.2. The two Governments undertake to collaborate in every possible wayuntil the German military power has been so broken as to render it incapable offurther threatening the peace of the world. They further undertake not to makepeace with any Government of Germany that does not clearly renounce allaggressive intentions.3. The two Governments are resolved to collaborate in restoring peace atthe end of the present war, and in subsequently maintaining it. The peace settlement must include the establishment and maintenance of conditions which
will ensure that Germany is not again in a position to disturb the peace of theworld.4. The two Governments undertake to work together in the task of thereconstruction of Europe after the war with full regard to each other&apos;s interestsand with the object of (a) safeguarding and strengthening the economic and political independence of all European countries either as unitary or federated States,   &apos;(&amp;) reconstructing the industrial and economic life of those countries whoseterritories have been overrun by the Axis Powers.5. As regards the territorial questions to be dealt with in the peace settlement, the two Governments will base their policy on the principle laid downin the joint declaration of the President of the United States and the PrimeMinister of the United Kingdom that they &apos;&apos; Seek no aggrandisement, territorialor other,&quot; and on that proclaimed by M. Stalin in his statement of the6th November, 1941, of no interference in the internal affairs of other people.They agree to work out the application of these principles in association with one another and with the United States of America and other Allied states concerned.6. Neither Government will enter into any secret agreement with anythird Power affecting or likely to affect the reeonstitution of Europe after thewar.7. The two Governments agree to render one another after the war allpossible economic assistance, and for this purpose will exchange economicmissions.8. The two Governments are convinced that the collaboration betweenthem, both in war and peace, provided for in the present agreement, will be ofbenefit not only to their respective peoples, but to the future of the world. Itis their earnest desire that all the countries now united in resistance to totali-tarian aggression should participate in such collaboration.Annex II.(Translation.)(Original Russian at His Majesty&apos;s Embassy.),Soviet draft December 16, 1941, 10 p.m.TREATY OF ALLIANCE AND MUTUAL MILITARY assistance between THE SOVIET UNION AND GREAT BRITAIN IN THEWAR AGAINST GERMANY.The Presidium of the Supreme Council of the U.S.S.R., on the one hand,and His Majesty The King of Great Britain on the other,Being inspired by an unswerving determination to carry to a victoriousconclusion the war which has been forced upon them by Hitlerite Germany, and being of the opinion that this object can best of all be achieved by the creationof an Alliance and by mutual military assistance between them,Have agreed in amplification of the Agreement concluded on the 12th Julyof this year concerning the common activities of the Government of the soviet union and the Government of His Majesty in the United Kingdom in the war against Germany to conclude the present Treaty, and have appointed as theirfully-empowered representatives :The Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union :His Majesty The King of Great Britain :

I should have thought, however, that thesettlement of these questions involved the application of the principle of collaboration between us, and that the right course would be to have tripartiteconversations, as early as may be, to seek agreement on these and other similarquestions affecting the settlement of Europe after the war. Indeed, this is nowclearly an essential preliminary to the preparation of the future peace settlement.I, for my part, can assure you that I will represent fully to my Governmentthe explanations which you have given me concerning the attitude of your government, and that I will advocate the initiation of such a tripartitediscussion at the earliest date convenient to the parties.Annex IX.The two Contracting Parties undertake to work for the reconstruction ofEurope after the war with full regard to the interests of both parties in their security as well as to the desire of the U.S.S.R. for the restoration of its frontiersviolated by the Hitlerite aggression and in accordance with the two principlesnot to seek territorial aggrandisement for themselves and not to interfere in the affairs of European peoples.Annex X.ANGLO-SOVIET COMMUNIQUE ON THE TALKS OF MM. STALIN.     &apos;   AND MOLOTOV WITH Mr. EDEN IN MOSCOW.In the second half of December 1941 there took place in Moscow, betweenthe President of the Council of People&apos;s Commissars, I. V. Stalin, and thePeople&apos;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, V. M. Molotov, on the one hand, andthe British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Anthony Eden, on the other,an exhaustive exchange of views on questions relating to the conduct of the warand to the post-war organisation of peace and security in Europe. The soviet ambassador in Great Britain, I. M. Maisky, and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inthe Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, were present at these conversations.Further, some of the meetings were attended by the British Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Alexander Cadogan, and by the&quot;Vice-Chief of the British Imperial General Staff, Lieutenant-General Nye.The conversations, which took place in a friendly atmosphere, showed the identity of views of both parties on all questions relating to the conduct of the&quot; The two Contracting Parties undertake to work together for thereconstruction of Europe after the war with full regard for eachother&apos;s interests.&quot; The objectives of this task of reconstruction, &amp;c.&quot;
(Secret.)II.RECORD OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE FOREIGN secretary and M. STALIN, DECEMBER 16, 1941, AT 7 p.m.Present:Mr. Eden. M. Stalin.Sir S. Cripps. M. Molotov.M. Maisky (who acted as inter-preter throughout the talks).M. STALIN suggested that there should be two treaties between the twocountries, both for publication.The first an alliance including mutual military assistance, as to which hethought there would be no objections.Secondly, a mutual agreement of a general nature as to post-war reconstruction of Europe and the content of the Peace Treaties.He then handed M. Maisky two drafts in Russian, which M. Maiskytranslated. He added that there should be to the second treaty a secret protocolconcerning the map of Europe after the War, and he suggested the following-contents :  1. The boundary of Poland should be extended at the expense of Germanyso as to get rid of the Corridor by the transfer of East Prussia to poland. The portion of Germany containing Tilsit and to the north of the Niemen River should be added to the Lithuanian Republic ofthe U.S.S.R.2. Czechoslovakia should be restored to her old frontiers, includingSudetenland. This latter could, under no circumstances, betransferred to Germany. The Czechoslovak frontiers should beextended to the South at the expense of Hungary.3. Yugoslavia should be restored and extended at the expense of Italy,that is to say so far as the Islands were concerned and certain coastaltowns.4. Albania might make an independent State with that independenceguaranteed.5. Turkey should receive the Dodecanese. Islands in the ^aegean especially important for Greece should go to Greece, but the Dodecanese shouldbe returned to Turkey.6. Greece should be restored in her old frontiers.7. All other occupied countries should be restored to their original frontiers.8. As to France, he would like to know Mr. Eden&apos;s opinion. Petain and company were absolutely hopeless, but what was to be the future ofFrance ? Was it necessary to make some plan for it or could we simplyignore it?Mr. EDEN : I agree as to Petain, and I think France may go through a long period of not being a first-class Power -somewhat similar to the experience of spain.war, and especially with regard to the necessity for the utter defeat of HitleriteGermany and the adoption thereafter of measures to render completely impossibleany repetition of German aggression in future. The exchange of views on questions relating to the post-war organisation of peace and security providedmuch important and useful material, which will&apos;facilitate a further elaboration of concrete proposals on this subject.Both parties are convinced that the Moscow conversations constitute a new and important forward step towards closer collaboration between the soviet union and Great Britain.
M. STALIN : I think if France is not restored or revived as a Great power in the near future it would be in your interest to have, on the French coast, some military and naval bases, such as Boulogne and Dunkirk; also Belgium and holland should be in open military alliance with Great Britain, who should havethe right to maintain in those countries naval and air bases there, and also troopsif necessary. I regard such an arrangement as important for Great Britain andalso as a guarantee for the independence of Holland and Belgium. The soviet union would be prepared to support you in all these plans, which they regard as important from the point of view of Great Britain.9. As to Germany, I think it is absolutely necessary in order to weakenGermany to detach the Bhineland from Prussia, especially theindustrial district. What should be done with it could be discussedafterwards; whether it was made an independent State or aprotectorate, &amp;c. I think this is the only guarantee which will ensurethat Germany would be permanently weakened.Austria should be restored as an Independent State and possiblyBavaria also might be constituted an independent country.10. As to the frontiers of the Soviet Union we should like to see the frontier in Finland and the Baltic Provinces restored to its position in 1941,immediately before the outbreak of war. So far as the frontier with poland, is concerned the Curzon Line should form the basis for this with perhaps some slight variation one way Or the other.The Roumanian frontier should be so formed as to includeBessarabia and Northern Bukovina in the Soviet Union.11. The Western frontier of Roumania should be extended at the expense of hungary, as there are, in that area, 1,250,000 Roumanians underHungarian rule, and Hungary must be punished for her part in thewar. I should also like an alliance between Roumania and the soviet union, guaranteeing Roumania against Hungary and giving theSoviet Union power to maintain military and naval bases onRoumanian territory.12. There should be a similar relationship between the Soviet Union and finland in the future, giving the former the right to mairtain navaland military bases on Finnish territory. The Soviet Union made agift of Petsamo to Finland, and this gift they would now like totake back again because of the very bad behaviour of the Finns.13. It is desirable to adjust the boundary between Turkey and Bulgaria and include in Turkey certain of the districts south of Bourgas which arepopulated by Turks, as Bulgaria also ought to be punished for herattitude in the war.This is approximately what I think might form the future map of europe and what might be put into the protocol. I should like to know Mr. Eden&apos;opinion on all these matters and as to what could or could not be included. Weshould have no objection to Great Britain having naval bases in Norway orDenmark, but we would like a guarantee by certain Powers as to the entrances to the Baltic Sea.Mr. EDEN : First as regards the two public documents. I have, as a matterof fact, drawn out myself a rough draft on somewhat similar lines but perhapsrather fuller in contents which you might like to look at. [The document handed to M. Maisky and translated by him to M. Stalin.] This is only a project and can be related to the two treaties suggested by you in any way that is consideredconvenient.. M. STALIN: There are two other questions I should like to ask as to post-war matters. First, what is your view as to reparations for the damage done by Germany and her satellites to Great Britain, the Soviet Union and othercountries; and, second, as to tlhe maintenance of peace and order in reconstitutedEurope&apos;! It will be necessary to have some military force for this purpose andI think it is desirable that there should be a military alliance between the democratic countries which would be organised under a council of some sort andit will have an international military force at its disposal. If certain of the; countries of Europe wish to federate, then the Soviet Union will have no objectionto such a course.
Mr. EDEN : As to post-war Europe, I am very grateful to you for disclosingyour mind so fully and personally I am in agreement with much that you have said. When I spoke of France just now I meant to indicate that the responsibilityfor post-war Europe would fall on our two countries, together with the UnitedStates of America, so far as that country was prepared to co-operate, and it isin that sense that we are now tackling the problem.As regards the future of Germany, you may be quite sure that the british people are determined that every possible measure should be taken in a militarysense to prevent Germany again breaking the peace.Exactly how this is to be done will require careful consideration. I shouldhave thought that there was no doubt that some sort of military control would benecessary over Germany and that Great Britain, the Soviet Union and the UnitedStates of America, if they would help, would have to be the people to undertakeit. As regards the partition of Germany no decision has been taken either wayby Flis Majesty&apos;s Government. There is no objection to it in principle. It is aquestion of which is the best way of keeping Germany under control. If we could bring about a dismemberment of Germany by action from within we should, Ithink, gain a great deal; and we have not closed our minds to the considerationof a separate Bavaria or Rhineland and we are certainly definitely in favour ofa separate Austria. I must confess that we have not gone so far as to examine this in detail as you have here, and I could not commit my colleagues on sucha question without first consulting them. It is, I think, extremely useful that weshould have an exchange of views. I will give you mine as a single Ministerand when I get back I will report to my colleagues and we could then carry thediscussion a stage further, either through M. Maisky or through our Ambassadorhere.So far as reparations are concerned, from our experience of the last warI am sure we should be against any money reparations, but the question of therestitution of goods taken away by Germany from occupied territories is, ofcourse, an altogether different question.M. STALIN: We, too, prefer restitution in kind.Mr. EDEN : We found after the last war that the Germans borrowed agreat deal of money which they used to set up new industries, &amp;c, and that in theresult it did us more harm than good.M. STALIN: I fully agree; money reparations are no good. The bestthing to do is to deprive Germany and Italy of their best machine tools for thebenefit of the countries they have occupied.Mr. EDEN : Exactly. Why should not Germany give you these machine tools in order to reconstitute-your industries which they have destroyed? That isthe kind of question we might explore further. I want to be quite frank about this matter. Even before Russia was attacked Mr. Roosevelt sent a message tous asking us not to enter into any secret arrangement as to the post-war^ reorganisation of Europe without first consulting him. This does not excludeour two countries from discussing a basis for the peace. Mr. Roosevelt wasworried because he had heard from somewhere that I had offered the yugoslav government some territorial extension, and he was nervous about this, as he didnot want the United States to go to the Peace Treaty and find that a lot of matters had been settled without their knowledge.M. STALIN : But there are many questions relating to the safety of our twocountries which can be discussed between us.Mr. EDEN : We can discuss matters between us, but ultimately, for thepurpose of the Peace Treaty, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and the UnitedStates of America must all come in and agree with one another on the principalworld affairs.M. STALIN : I agree.Mr. EDEN : I agree very much with what you said about federation. Ithink if some of those small countries could come together, for example, Poland,Czechoslovakia or the Balkan countries, they would thus have a better chanceof preserving their economic and political independence against any attack which germany was contemplating.
,. i The Prime Minister has asked me to give you a frank statement of our military position so that you would know our exact situation as regards future military plans. [Mr. Eden delivered the Prime Ministers secret message to&apos;M. Stalin at this point.]Mr. EDEN : Before going into this question of military plans, perhaps wehad better clear up a political point. Shall we try and combine our two documents,or what would you like to do ?M. STALIN : I think that what you have submitted is a kind of declara-tion, whereas ours are two agreements. A declaration I regard as algebra, butan agreement as practical arithmetic. I do not wish to decry algebra, but Iprefer practical arithmetic, and I think in the present circumstances, when Hitleris boasting to everyone of all the treaties he has managed to obtain, it would be wiser to have treaties between the two countries, and our documents are in thatform.Mr. EDEN : Perhaps I could take the two treaties as a basis and see ifthere is anything in our document which it is worth while incorporating in thetwo treaties.M. STALIN : What about the attachment of the secret protocol?Mr. EDEN : My difficulty is that I cannot sign such a document without consulting my colleagues, and we have not as yet applied our minds to these problems.M. MAISKY : Not even the Soviet frontiers ?Mr. EDEN : I couldn&apos;t&apos;t do this without consulting the Prime Minister andalso talking to the Americans. We could give an answer when I get back toLondon, which I could communicate to M. Maisky, and then we could continue with the discussion. I am afraid we have a troublesome Constitution, and, apartfrom the question of America, we have to consult the Dominions, who are helpingus in the war and naturally expect to be consulted as to what we arrange asregards national frontiers after the war.M. STALIN : Perhaps it would be possible to do it in London by an exchangeof notes.Mr. EDEN : We should have to tell the United States of America if we weredeciding upon anything so important in its effect upon Eastern Europe and, inany case, I think it would be much wiser for us to tell them about it.M. STALIN : I am quite agreeable to your informing America, and I wouldbe very glad if the United States would participate.Mr. EDEN: I doubt whether they would do that. It is best to let meconsult the Prime Minister when I get back and then let you know what are his views. I can assure you that we are entirely realistic in our determination to stop the Germans from repeating their aggression, and I very much hope thatyou fully understood that.M. STALIN : I ith the proposal.   What I want to underline is thatI want to come to an agreement with you on this so as to have a united front onthese problems.Mr. EDEN : We have not yet worked this out ourselves. We have not yeteven discussed it in the Cabinet. . I have yet to discuss the question of Poland and east Prussia with the Prime Minister.M. STALIN : I quite understand. My desire is to establish that the war aims of our two countries are identical, as then our alliance will be all the stronger.  If our war aims were different then there would be no alliance.Mr. EDEN : I agree. I see no reason why our war aims should be different,but these frontier questions I must discuss with my colleagues. My object willbe to seek to reconcile the war aims of the two countries. There may be some points on which there are differences. [Here there was a discussion around the map as to the new boundary around Tilsit.]Mr. EDEN : Did you say anything about this to the Poles ?
M. STALIN : No, but you can tell them it will be necessary. Up as faras the River Oder could be given to Poland and then the rest left for a BerlinState.Mr. EDEN : There is a difficulty in cutting up Germany unless the move-ment for it comes from within the country, as you may cause an irredentistmovement to unite the country again, rather like the A nschluss.M. STALIN : These kind of conceptions brought us to the present war.Would you like to try another attack by Germany ?Mr. EDEN : I think that is rather an over-simplification of the causes ofthe war.M. STALIN : My military advisers believe that Germany has given theJapanese about 1,500 aircraft. They are not absolutely certain about this, butthey have several good reasons to believe it; and that German pilots are working for Japan as well.Mr. EDEN : Certainly the Japanese have shown more skill in the air than we expected.M. STALIN : We had experience with air fighting with Japan, and alsowe have carefully observed it in China for a very long time, and I have come tothe conclusion that this is not really a Japanese war. I think some of theJapanese pilots were trained in Germany, and others are Germans.Mr. EDEN : How do you think the aeroplanes got there ?M. STALIN : Probably through South America. Certain South american states, if they do not encourage, at least do not discourage these activities, and spain and Portugal might also help.Mr. EDEN : I am grateful to you for this information. I would like to look into it.M. STALIN : 1 cannot give you absolute proof, but have good reason tobelieve it.Mr. EDEN : I am certain that the attacks on the Prince of Wales were pressed with great skill and determination and were as good as any of the german attacks upon our warships.M. STALIN: And then there is the reason that for the last six weeks wehave noticed a considerable decrease of German aviation on our front, also we know that the arrival of new German aircraft on our front is very small, whereas the German production is from 2,000 to 2,500 a month.  Where are they going?Mr. EDEN : We thought that refitting and the weather might account forsome of it, also some have been sent to Libya, but not such a quantity as youmention.M. STALIN : In Libya the Germans have less aviation than the British andthe number is not very great. Nor is it on our front. Where then is the Germanaviation?Mr. EDEN : Perhaps I can tell you now that when I left England I hoped to offer you 10 squadrons from our Air Force to co-operate with yours at yourfront as soon as progress with Libyan operations allowed, but since I left LondonI heard that these extra squadrons would have to go to Singapore as the air attack there is very heavy.M. STALIN : I fully understand and I have no objections.Mr. EDEN : It is a great disappointment to us.M. STALIN : I fully realise the position and that the situation has changed.We also have had our difficult periods., Mr. EDEN: I very much appreciate the spirit of your answer, and if thewheel goes round again we shall be very glad to help.M. STALIN : What about tanks ?
Mr. EDEN : They will go on coming just the same. The anxiety I have isabout American production. I am afraid they will reduce delivery to us in tanks and in aircraft. For instance, in the Middle&apos; East we. are reinforcing our airunits from America and sending you the Hurricanes which would otherwise goto the Middle East. If the Americans stop their supplies the position will become a very anxious one. [Mr. Eden then gave a description of the British militarysituation from his note.]M. STALIN : Now what would you like to ask me about our militarysituation ? -Mr. EDEN : I would like to have a general view of how it is developing and what you think is likely to be your plan through the winter and in the spring.M. STALIN : The war policy of the Soviet Union has so far been that of a fighting retreat.  We have defended every district and every point so as to weardown gradually the German forces.   The moment has now arrived when thewearing-clown process has reached the point where the Germans feel the pinch.The German soldiers are tired.   Their Commanders hoped to finish the war beforethe winter and they made no preparations for a winter campaign.  This Decemberthe German army has shown itself tired and ill-clad and just at this time newSoviet armies and formations reached the front.   These reinforcements createdthe possibility for the change over at the front which you have noticed duringthe last two weeks.   The Germans attempted to dig themselves in, but were notinclined to make very strong fortifications.  Our troops were able to break through and&apos; now we have the possibility of attacking; counter-attacks have graduallydeveloped into counter-offensives.  We shall try and carry this on all through thewinter.   When the new German formations will be ready to come to the frontI don&apos;t know.   Just now the Germans are reorganising their old forces and making new formations.   It is difficult to say when this will be; in any caseprobably not for two months, so we have two months in hand.   In any case our army will try to carry on an offensive all through the winter.  It is difficult to say how far we shall move forward, but that will be our policy until the spring.  Wehave now the air superiority, but not a very great one.   The Germans still havea great superiority in tanks, and tanks are vitally necessary for us. especiallyValentines, which we have found to be much better for use in the winter.   TheMatilda will be all right in the summer weather, but the engine is too weak forwinter conditions.   We shall go ahead on all fronts.   In the south the positionis quite satisfactory.   The bringing in of fresh reinforcements was the cause ofthe recent successes.   The German army is not so strong after all.   It is only because it has an enormous reputation.Mr. EDEN : What about the position of Turkey. Can we do anything toimprove that situation?M. STALIN : Tell them they will get the Dodecanese.Mr. EDEN : That is very difficult with the Greeks, as the islands are mostlyinhabited by Greeks and the Greek people have long planned to have them.M. STALIN: You cannot be very strict in pursuing this nationalityprinciple.   Also in Greece there are Turks.Mr. EDEN : Do you think it would have an effect upon the Turks ?M. STALIN : All these islands blockade the outlet from Turkey. You could arrange an exchange of islands between Greece and Turkey so that some went to one and some to the other.Mr. EDEN : Some time ago when we thought we might take the Dodecanesewe started conversations with Greece and Turkey, but they did not go at all well.M. STALIN : The Turks would also like to have Dedeagatch but we mustnot offend the Greeks, but I think there might be an exchange of islands.Mr. EDEN : It is certainly worth exploring.M. STALIN: Could you not give them something in Syria ?Mr. EDEN : I don&apos;t think it&apos;s impossible.   They have claims there.M. STALIN: It&apos;s worth exploring.
Mr. EDEN : Have you observed any change in their attitude towards theGermans lately ?M. STALIN : The Turks are very much afraid of the Germans but theydo not like the Germans.Mr. EDEN : Do you think they would let the Germans go through Turkey ?M. STALIN : I doubt it.Mr. EDEN : So do I. As long as they remain a buttress against Germanythey are a great help to us.M. STALIN : I think they must be paid for it.Mr. EDEN : But you have been giving them oil for it.M. STALIN : But we do not want to give them top much in case they want to re-export it to Germany.A somewhat general conversation followed, of which the following are themain points of importance :  Japanese war. Mr. Eden expressed the view that there would be great difficulties for us in the Pacific, especially in view of the loss of our battleships.M. Stalin seemed to take this as a hint that they might help. He immediatelysaid that, unfortunately, they could do nothing to help us there at present, andMr. Eden at once made it very clear that he had not in any way intended tosuggest such a thing. M. Stalin continued : &quot;I appreciate your attitude. Wecan do nothing now, but in the spring we shall be ready, and will then help.&quot;&apos;He made it quite clear that the antagonism between Russia and Japan couldonly be settled by force. He thought that the Japanese would weaken themselves by the dispersal of their efforts.Conference at Chungking. M. Stalin announced that he had received theday before a telegraphic message from President Roosevelt asking him to berepresented at a conference at Chungking, under the chairmanship of chiang kai-shek -shek, at which the Americans, the British and the Netherlands East Indieswould be present. The Soviet Union were to be represented as observers. Theconference was to meet the next day, so that it was impossible to make any arrangements about it. In addition, he had no information as to what the, conference was about. Could Mr. Eden tell him? Mr. Eden explained that hehad had a telegram that very morning speaking of three conferences, one atChungking, one at Singapore and one in Moscow, and that he presumed theywere about the Pacific war.^ General de Gaulle. M. Stalin said that he thought some better person should be found to lead the Free French movement. Had we any news ofGeneral Weygand and had the latter tried to contact us since he had beenturned out ? General de Gaulle was very reactionary and surrounded bycagoulards. Mr. Eden said we had no news of Weygand, who was at Antibes,and he had not tried to contact us. He thought that he was no good to us. he did not think there was anyone else who could be found to take the place of1 - General de Gaulle, and so we must support him despite his drawbacks, as he was-certainly strongly anti-Hitler. M. Stalin asked whether there were not someFrench emigres in America who might be used.  If not, we must certainly support.. General de Gaulle, as he was anti-Hitler and that was the real thing thatmattered.:r .     Persia. M. Stalin said that he was satisfied with the way things had gone&quot;There, though they had been rather slow.   It was better to avoid the spilling of blood and go a bit slower.   The only alternative would have been to have spilt alot of blood.War responsibility. Hitler and his gang who were responsible for thebrutalities and the aggression were, said M. Stalin, men without any honour,honesty and decency. They were treaty breakers and ought not to be tolerated.They should be imprisoned and then shot. Mr. Eden said : &quot; I agree that theymust be dealt with.&quot;
Yugoslavia. M. Stalin said, in answer to Mr. Eden&apos;s enquiry, that he understood that the guerrilla fighting was increasing, but that there was stilldissension between the so-called Communists and the others.Military Mission. Upon Mr. Eden suggesting that all was not well with therelationships on this side, M. Stalin said that he realised that the Mission weredissatisfied, and he thought that they had reason to be. The difficulty was thatthere were not too many generals and they were all very overworked and had&apos;teven time to sleep. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador explained that the difficulty lay with the &apos;&apos; Otdel&apos;&apos; (General Staff Liaison Department), and that when contactswere established with the actual operational staffs all went swimmingly.M. Stalin then suggested that the Mission should come to Moscow. Mr. Edenreadily accepted this.RECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE FOREIGN secretary and M. STALIN ON THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER 17, 1941,MIDNIGHT.Mr. EDEN : You have probably seen the work we did this morning on theagreements.M. STALIN : Yes, the work is very interesting, but I am more interestedin the question of the future frontiers of the U.S.S.R. Have you yet been able toget any decisions from your Government ?Mr. EDEN : No. Nor have I tried to get any. I have not telegraphed forthis purpose, and with the Prime Minister on the high seas it is not possible tostate the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the matter. I have telegraphedthe Prime Minister an account of our interview last night, and I have told himI would bring back your suggestions as to the future frontiers of Europe andthat I would discuss them in London and then communicate again with youthrough diplomatic channels.M. STALIN : You will remember that last night we talked of the possibilityof doing something as regards the frontiers of the U.S.S.R. apart from the general question of Central and Western European frontiers. The Soviet Governmentis very interested in this question because during the time of the ChamberlainGovernment in the earlier negotiations they broke down on this very questionof the Baltic countries and Finland, and we want to know what is the position on this matter of the present British Government.Mr. EDEN : Of course I was not a member of the Chamberlain government at that time, so I cannot tell what went on in the Government. I do, however,fully realise that you want security on your north-western frontier, and also  bear in mind that we have signed the Atlantic Charter. I am afraid it isimpossible for me to give you any decision on this question because that decision must be a decision of the British Government. All I can do is to report to them what your views are, and then communicate, as I have promised, with you againthrough diplomatic channels.M. STALIN : Is it really necessary on this question of the Baltic States tohave a Government decision? Surely this is absolutely axiomatic. We are fighting our hardest and losing hundreds of thousands of men in the common(Secret.)III.Present:Mr. Eden.Sir S. Cripps.Hon. Sir A. Cadogan.Lieut.-General Nye.M. Stalin.M. Molotov.M. Maisky.
cause with Great Britain as our ally, and I should have thought that such aquestion as the position of the Baltic States ought to be axiomatic and ought notto require any decision.Mr. EDEN : You mean the future of the Baltic States at the end of the war ?M. STALIN : Yes. Would you support the entry of these three States atthe end of the war into the Soviet Union ?Mr. EDEN : The present position is that we do not recognise the indepen-dent existence of any of these States. They have no diplomatic status with us,but we are committed to the United States of America, not to bind ourselves asto any decision upon European frontiers before the end of the war without con-sultation with them. I am, however, prepared to seek a decision from my government on this issue and also consult the Americans upon it as soon as I get back to London. I think it is most desirable that all three Governments should come to an agreement on this question.M. STALIN : In that case I am afraid there will be great difficulty incoming to any agreement on these proposed treaties.Mr. EDEN : This is really quite a new issue which you are raising. Youwill remember that the Prime Minister has long since stated publicly that wecannot acknowledge, during the war, any changes of sovereignty that have beenmade since the beginning of the war.M. STALIN : Last night I put forward the question of your recognising atleast the post-Avar frontiers of the U.S.S.R. We might reoccupy the baltic states in the near future, and how are we to know that in that event GreatBritain will not deny to us these frontiers ?Mr. EDEN : The Prime Minister made his statement that we would not recognise changes made during the war when Germany was advancing, and that statement was really to the advantage of the U.S.S.R. The statement was madepublicly to the whole world, and it is quite clear that I cannot now decide this issue, though, as I have said, I am prepared to take it up when I return toLondon.M. STALIN : If you say that, you might well say to-morrow that you donot recognise the Ukraine as forming part of the U.S.S.R.Mr. EDEN : That is a complete misunderstanding of the position. It isonly changes from the pre-war frontiers that we do not recognise. The onlychange in the Ukraine is its occupation by Germany, so of course we accept theUkraine as being part of the U.S.S.R.M. STALIN : This seems to be just the same position as was taken by theChamberlain Government on the question of the Baltic States, and in that event it is difficult to come to any terms on these agreements.Mr. EDEN : I can only say that I am sorry if that is so. Our position isperfectly clear. The Americans have asked us not to agree to any alteredboundaries in Europe, but I am prepared to put the question up to my Govern-ment and to the Americans and then to give you the answer. I cannot give you that answer now without consulting the Americans. If you wish for it andattach great importance to this point, then I will try and get a favourableanswer for you upon it. There is this difference between the present and theearlier negotiations which I should like to make plain. At the time of the earliernegotiations the Baltic States were free and independent States. Since that timethose States have ceased to exist as independent States, and therefore de factothe situation is now a completely different one.M. STALIN : Where is the evidence of that ? You still have their repre-sentatives in London.Mr. EDEN : We don&apos;t accept them as representatives. We neither acceptnotes from them nor allow them diplomatic status. The U.S.S.R. is, in fact,recognised as having the de facto sovereignty of the Baltic States.M. STALIN : That seems to be a very curious situation.
Mr. EDEN : I agree it may seem curious, but I don&apos;t really think that thisis a very important political question. The present position is that there are noindependent Baltic States and that in fact they do form part of the U.S.S.R. Iam prepared to get an answer for you on your question if you wish for it fromthe British Government.M. STALIN : I am surprised and amazed at Mr. Churchill&apos;s Governmenttaking up this position. It is practically the same as that of the ChamberlainGovernment.Mr. EDEN : I have tried to explain to you what the difference is. The baltic states have now ceased to exist as independent States and they are in fact partof the Soviet Union. Do you want me to say that they are recognised de jure aspart of the U.S.S.E. ?M. STALIN : We are in the midst of the greatest war of history and I thinkthese nice formulas about de jure and de facto, &amp;c, are rather out of place.According to our Constitution the three States form part of the U.S.S.E. Thisis the result of a plebiscite in which the great majority of all the inhabitantsvoted in favour of coming into the U.S.S.R. If the U.S.S.R. retained these three republics in their Constitution does the British Government have any objection ?Mr. EDEN: Of course we cannot take objection to what the SovietGovernment do or do not put into their Constitution.M. STALIN: If so, and the British Government does not have any objection, then some method of saying that should be found.Mr. EDEN: My difficulties, and I want to be perfectly frank about this,are twofold. Firstly, the Prime Minister has stated publicly that we could not accept any territorial changes made during the war. It may be that thisparticular change is an exceptional one, and if you wish it I will consult theBritish Government on that basis and let you have their answer. Secondly, underthe Atlantic Charter we have pledged ourselves to take into account the wishes of the inhabitants. It may be that in this case they have been taken into account,but that is a matter that we must check up on before we arrive at a decision.M. STALIN : Yes; they were taken into account before the war.Mr. EDEN : But not before our war started with Germany.M. STALIN : Then I think we shall have to postpone the signing of thetwo treaties.Mr. EDEN : That, of course, is for you to decide. I should like to meetyou, but I cannot do so without consulting my Government and the UnitedStates of America. I should not have thought that that was any good reasonfor not signing these agreements, which will be of value to both our countries,and which offer greater possibilities for the future of our arriving at anagreement upon this question of frontiers, and certainly do not in any wayprejudice it.M. STALIN : It is not only the question of the Baltic States, but of thewhole of the Western frontiers of the Soviet Union.Mr. EDEN : I should like you to understand my position in this matter. Wepromised President Roosevelt, and it was nothing to do with this present visit of mine, indeed before the Russian Government came into the war, not to agreeto any changes in the European boundaries without consultation. You will agree that, if I had made such an agreement with you, you would expect me tokeep it. There is nothing in these proposed agreements which in any wayprevents my putting the question of your Western boundaries up to the UnitedStates of America.M. STALIN : I think that the whole war between us and Germany beganbecause of these western frontiers of the U.S.S.R., including particularly theBaltic States. That is really what the whole war is about, and. what I wouldlike to know is whether our ally, Great Britain, supports us in regaining theseWestern frontiers.,
Mr. EDEN : We in this war are fighting for lots of people&apos;s frontiers. as you know, we went to war because of the aggression against Poland, but we havenever tied ourselves down to any particular frontiers, as you will remember westated clearly in the Polish-Russian negotiations. If, however, you wish us toagree to some specific boundaries now, I will try to get it done, but I cannot doit myself as I am bound by my promise to America.M. STALIN : We are bound by the provisions of our Constitution.Mr. EDEN : Of course you are and we have no objection whatever to that,but we are not bound by your Constitution. Up to this point I have not agreedto any frontiers anywhere in Europe. I didn&apos;t hear of these frontiers which younow propose until I came here last night and I cannot agree to them until I have consulted both my own Government and America.M. STALIN : This attitude of the British Government towards our frontiersis indeed a surprise for me so I think it will be better to postpone the proposedagreements.Mr. EDEN: There is nothing new at all about our attitude. We should expect, if we were to sign these agreements, to consult with you on questions ofEuropean boundaries such as,- for instance, the French boundary and the questionof Alsace and Lorraine, and that is one of the things that this agreement says.M. STALIN : To-morrow, perhaps, our troops might occupy the three baltic states, and then perhaps at the Peace Conference you would take an objectionto that occupation.Mr. EDEN : If you were to do so no one would be more delighted than myself.M. STALIN : I don&apos;t understand.Mr. EDEN : This is the position. In your view and according to yrourConstitution the three States now form part of the U.S.S.R. In our view, at themoment, they are neither within it nor without it. If you wish us to come to adecision upon this I can consult the American Government.M. STALIN : Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. are now allies, and as I under-stand it an ally must support an ally. If anyone were to come co me and ask measures to the desirability of touching the Irish Free State, I should tell him to get out. If Great Britain wanted air and military bases in Belgium and HollandI should certainly give my support to it, because it affected the safety of Britainand raises the question of their security.Mr. EDEN : This is not a question of loyalty, but we have committedourselves to America as I have stated, and the Prime Minister has made a public statement to which I have referred. I am sure that you would not respect meif I were to go back upon my arrangement with President Roosevelt. I can get a decision upon this point before the Soviet troops occupy the Baltic States, evenif they continue doing as well as they are doing now.M. STALIN : If you cannot give us your support on this question of ourour western frontiers, which is the main question for us in the war, perhaps itwould be best to postpone these&quot;agreements and to fall back upon our agreementof July last.Mr. EDEN : That is a matter for you to decide. From the point of viewof Anglo-Soviet relations, there would undoubtedly be a great disappointment inour country and in the Dominions. Nothing in these agreements in any way-weakens the claims that you have put forward as regards frontiers.M. STALIN: We, too, have our public opinion here and they wouldcertainly be horrified if they learnt that Great Britain was not prepared tosupport us on the question of our frontiers in the Baltic States.Mr. EDEN : There is certainly nothing of that sort in the agreements, noris it in the least necessarily the position.M. STALIN : If our people were to learn that, after all their sacrifices,Great Britain, our ally, was reluctant to support the claim of the U.S.S.R. thatthe Baltic States in fact form part of the U.S.S.R., then they would certainlyregard these treaties as scraps of paper.
Mr. EDEN : I don&apos;t think that that is a fair way of putting it. I had never heard of these western boundaries until I got here, and I cannot agree tothem without first putting them to my own Government and to the Dominionsand to America. But that does not in the least prevent us being loyal allies orfrom doing all we can to help you to defeat the Germans.M. STALIN : You were in general informed of the two questions ofimportance : military collaboration and post-war reconstruction, including thequestion of frontiers. If the general question of European frontiers is a difficult one to decide upon, at least that of the Soviet frontiers is in a different category.Mr. EDEN : I have always, as you know, been very strongly in favour of promoting good relations between our two countries, but there are limitations tothe power of a Minister in our country, and I cannot commit the country to yourpropositions without consulting my own Government, the Dominions and theUnited States of America.M. STALIN : I am far from blaming you for your attitude and I know very well of your desire to improve relations between our two countries. I wouldnot like to blame the British Government but I am surprised that upon thisquestion our Allies cannot give us their support.Mr. EDEN : Let me take the case of Canada and the question of the frontier between Poland and Russia. Canada has sent us hundreds of thousands ofsoldiers to help in the war and if they were to hear to-morrow that I had agreedupon the Polish-Russian frontier without any consultation with them they wouldhave every right to the strongest complaint. No Minister who did a thing like that could survive for twenty-four hours.M. STALIN : I certainly do not want to demand the impossible from you and I fully realise the limitation of your powers, but I am addressing myself tothe British Government and I am genuinely surprised. I thought that the atlantic Charter was directed against those people who were trying to establishworld dominion. It now looks as if the Charter was directed against theU.S.S.R.. Mr. EDEN : No; that is certainly not so. It is merely a question of yourputting forward certain views as to your frontiers and of my being unable to give you an immediate reply and asking you to allow me time to get the answer.M. STALIN : Why does the restoration of our frontiers come into conflict with the Atlantic Charter ?Mr. EDEN : I never said that it did.M. STALIN : When you gave your pledges to America we were not thenallies of yours and our relations were very different. At that time the Britishand French Governments were contemplating giving help to Finland against theSoviet Union.  Now you are at war with Finland.Mr. EDEN : And we did that in order to please you.M. STALIN : Yes, I understand that, but the position is now changed.Mr. EDEN : If you were asking for the frontiers which existed in 1939before the war broke out between us and Germany there would be no difficulty atall but now you are asking for frontiers which differ from those of 1939 in variousplaces. I have taken a note of that and will report it to my Government, but i cannot see how these agreements that it is proposed to sign will make it any moredifficult for us to give you the answer that you want.M. STALIN : It makes it look as if I should have to come cap in hand.Mr. EDEN : Not at all, I don&apos;t understand that. These are documents ofperfect equality and don&apos;t represent the conferring of anything by either partyupon the other.M. MOLOTOV : We are talking of common war aims, of what we are bothfighting for. On one of these important aims, our western frontiers, we have no support from Great Britain.
Mr. EDEN : It is not a question of support or lack of support.  For the first: time last night I heard the details of the boundaries which you thought you oughtto have.   It is a technical question, as M. Molotov will realise in his position as foreign Secretary, of the consents that we must obtain.   No English foreign secretary for the last 200 years could have done what you are asking me to do.M. MOLOTOV : It is a question of the decision of the British Governmentand not of yourself.Mr. EDEN: If the Prime Minister and myself were both here we still couldnot give you that decision. It is a question of our meeting the demands of theU.S.S.R,. We are fighting as a family with our Dominions and we must consult them.M. STALIN : Last night, when we were discussing the question of the wholemap of Europe, it was obviously new and a complicated matter, and I did not insist upon your accepting our views, and agreed that they should be referred to your Cabinet, but the western frontier of the U.S.S.R. is in a different category. and should surely be an easy matter as between allies.Mr. EDEN : I agree, of course, that it is in a different category, but it is; still a question of frontiers in Europe and of some complication since these runfrom Finland and the Baltic States in the north to Roumania in the south.I cannot say more than that I will report the matter to my Cabinet How could agree, for instance, to the Polish-Russian frontier without saying a word about it to the Poles first ?M. STALIN : The Polish frontier remains an open question and I do not insist upon settling that now. What I. am most interested in is the position in finland and the Baltic States and in Roumania. With regard to Poland, I hopethat we shall be able to come to an agreement between the three of us. Generallyspeaking our idea is to keep to the Curzon Line with certain modifications.But it is very important for us to know whether we shall have to fight at thePeace Conference in order to get our western frontiers.Mr. EDEN : I am certainly hoping not.   As to Poland, we shall always,v of course, be glad to do anything we can to help in reaching an agreement.   we want to agree to the frontiers before the Peace Conference, but we have not yet reached that point, and it seems to me to be not unreasonable to ask you to let me consult the necessary persons on these very important proposals.M. STALIN : I fully appreciate your position, that you cannot give me any definite answers.Mr. EDEN : I am sorry to appear difficult. I certainly don&apos;t want to be, but under our Constitution that is my position.M^ STALIN : I fully realise that.Mr. EDEN : This is the letter which I promised to let you have as regardsaccession to the agreements by the Dominions [that I handed to M. Maisky, whoexplained the position and translated it]. Unofficially I can say that, in my own view, I think the Dominions would be very glad to- accede. [At this pointM. Stalin for the first time took copies of the agreements before him and started to study them.]M. MOLOTOV : I am of the opinion that this question of the westernfrontiers is the major question for us, and if no definite answer can be obtainedupon it I think it is better to put off the signing of the agreements.Mr. EDEN : That is for you to decide. I think that my Government wouldbe astonished if that were to happen. I came out here with full powers to signagreements on the two points you mention, covering all general matters, but Ihad no previous warning whatever that this matter of the western frontiers wasthe major question. If I go back without any agreement the effect on all alliedopinion will, in my view, be extremely bad.M. STALIN : Do you think any mention of frontiers could be made in thesecond treaty. Perhaps it would be desirable to postpone the consideration ofthis matter until to-morrow.
Mr. EDEN : Frankly, and in all friendliness I think it would be a great pityto postpone indefinitely the signature of the treaties.   The Germans would be -bound to find out about my visit here and if the British Foreign Secretary comes to Moscow especially and then signs nothing as a result it will undoubtedly causevery great rejoicing, but I don&apos;t press that aspect of the question.M. STALIN : It is not our intention that you should go back empty-handed.There is another question that I would like to raise. I think that in a few monthstime Japan will be beaten in the Pacific.Mr. EDEN : I very much hope so and I am glad you think so.  I have greatrespect for your judgment in these matters and it cheers me up considerably.M. STALIN : And if at the same time our troops are successfully pushingthe Germans to the West, would it not then be possible to discuss the question of opening a second front in Europe, either in the Balkans or somewhere else sothat the Germans could be attacked from the West as well as from the East.Mr. EDEN : I am quite willing to discuss that question now. I haveGeneral Nye with me here and would like him to put to you some of our problems on this question. One of the reasons for our attacking in Libya is to get a base in North Africa for a possible attack on Europe at some later date, and we donot at all exclude the possibility of such an attack. Do you really think thatsix months will see the end of the Japanese in the East.M. STALIN : I think that it will, because the Japanese have not muchpower behind them, and if the Japanese were to break out of their neutralitywith us and try to attack us, then I think the end would come so much the sooner. .Mr. EDEN : They won&apos;t do that. They may be very mad, but I do not think they are mad enough for that.M. STALIN : They might do it.(Secret.)IV.RECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE FOREIGN secretary and M. STALIN ON DECEMBER 18, 1941, AT 7 p.m.Present:Mr. Eden. M. Stalin.Sir S. Cripps. M. Molotov.Hon. Sir A. Cadogan. M. Maisky.Ligu.t. - GrGiicrbX N&quot;yc.M. STALIN : If you have nothing new I think we have got out a suitableformula.Mr. EDEN : I have been working on it, but I would rather hear yoursuggestion first.M. STALIN: So far as the post-war agreement is concerned, I thinkArticles 1 and 2 can be merged into a single Article, with Article 2 as the preamble to Article 1. Article 3 can remain as it is and become Article 2. ThenArticle 4 would become Article 3 and run as follows : &apos;&apos; The two contracting parties undertake to work together for thereconstruction of Europe after the War with full regard to the interests ofboth parties in their security as well as to the interests of the. U.S.S.R. inthe restoration of frontiers violated by Hitler&apos;s aggression and in accordancewith the two following principles : &quot; (1) Not -to seek territorial aggrandisement for themselves inEurope, and&apos;&apos; (2) Not to interfere in the internal affairs of other European -countries.&quot;[These suggestions were then taken off to be typed, and M. Stalinpassed to the military agreement.]
Why can&apos;t the military agreement be in the form of a treaty such as you had with Turkey?Mr. EDEN : It is a question of form. In a treaty the King contracts as representing Great Britain and the Dominions, and the latter must either be consulted first or else excluded from the operation of the treaty by the insertion of a special clause which would be undesirable.M. STALIN : How was the treaty with Turkey concluded then?Mr. EDEN : I don&apos;t know for certain as I didn&apos;t do it. Probably theDominions signed, and if you want it to wait three weeks or so it could probablybe done in this case.M. STALIN : I am surprised at your having a treaty with Turkey annow creating a difficulty as to having a treaty with us.   If you have anjdifficulty in entering into a treaty with us, then it is much better to say so.Mr. EDEN : That is not the question at all.   It is simply a matter of time if you want a treaty you can certainly have it.   The Turkish treaty took man;months to negotiate.   If you wish it, we can now sign the agreement as betweeGreat Britain and the U.S.S.R., and then when the Dominions have acceded tit a treaty could be signed in London in proper form and ratified.M. STALIN : I agree to that procedure. There is another point which arise as to the military agreement. In order to make it a live document, and not merelya piece of paper, it is desirable to have something practical done in connexiowith the military agreement. You will remember I originally asked for a seconfront in Europe, but you could not do that, and I accepted the decision, antthen there was a second proposal that some British troops should be sent to th&apos;Soviet Front. I think it is desirable that some British troops should be seninto the Soviet Union, in order to take up positions at a specified part of th&apos;front, but, if this also is impossible, then I make a third suggestion, for a jointoperation in the north against Petsamo and the north of Norway. We would!be prepared to supply the military troops if you would help with the navy and!air force. You might, for instance, occupy one of the fiords, create a base therejand make it a centre for action by the Norwegians. I believe that this woulcreate a considerable diversion, and would alarm the Germans and help us.Mr. EDEN : As to the south, as I explained, we have not at the moment1any forces available; owing to the Libyan campaign having turned out to be moredifficult than we thought, there are none available, but if you will tell us what you would wish to have in the south, then we could discuss the possibilitiesof doing something later. As to your third suggestion for the north, I amcertainly ready to go into it now, and if you could let me know how soon you suggest it should be carried out and at what time of the year, I will get GeneralNye to come and discuss it whenever you like.M. STALIN : So far as the operation in the north is concerned, I think we]might try it in a month or six weeks&apos; time.Mr, EDEN : What co-operation would you want from us ?M. STALIN : The Navy and aviation, and also a few troops if you can sparethem. We would contribute the bulk of troops. The objective would be to takePetsamo and perhaps Northern Norway, and to create in Northern Norway a centre of resistance against the Germans. You might gradually send out therethe Norwegian volunteers. So far as the Germans are concerned, they have not gotmany troops in that area and they are mostly Austrians, and, from the point ofview of morale, they are in a bad state.Mr. EDEN : I would like to send for General Nye to discuss this or see himafter our meeting so that we can get on with it at once. I should like to do this because the suggestion interests me very much.M. STALIN : With regard to the sending of troops to our front, I thinkthat if they were to come in by the northern ports they should go to some placelike the Estonian front, though I would have no objection to using them on theFinnish frontier, but I think you would probably prefer not to do that, and so thetroops could be placed somewhere on the Leningrad front.   If the troops were
to come in from the south they should go to some part of the Ukrainian front.If there are at present no troops available, can you tell me whether you wouldhave some available in the future, and if so, when \Mr. EDEN : As to the south, we had thought that we might have themavailable very soon, but the Libyan battles have proved more stubborn than we expected, and I am sure you will agree that we ought to see the Libyan campaignright through until we reach Tripoli. When that campaign is cleared up, then the question will arise as to whether it would be more valuable to the soviet union to send into the Ukraine any forces we might be able to spare or,alternatively, supplies for the Russian army. As the lines of communication are limited we could not send both, but I am certain we must get the Libyan frontcleared up first. As regards the north and the Leningrad front, I do not thinkthat we could send any troops this winter which would be of any material assistance. We have no troops trained for winter conditions or for using skis,and any we sent would have to be maintained through Murmansk, and that would interfere with the supplies we are sending you. I should not have thought itwas a very economic proposition to send troops up there, but if you like I will put it up to the Prime Minister.M. STALIN : I should not like to insist on that unless you think it ispossible.o Mr. EDEN : Our position on shipping is pretty tight, especially as we haveto help out the Americans with shipping in order to send you supplies. It is taking up 1,500,000 tons of shipping for this northern supply route, but I willlook into the matter here.M. STALIN : If the operation took place which I have suggested againstPetsamo and Northern Norway, would you be able to maintain connexions withPetsamo and bring in supplies for your forces and for ours, and if so throughwhat port ?Mr. EDEN : I can go into that matter now while I am here. Let me nowtell you what my suggestions are as to the second agreement. I have tried tomeet what you asked for last night, that is some reference to frontiers. You will remember that you suggested that we should insert in the document a referenceto the frontier question and I suggest we recast Article 1 so as to read in theform I now hand you. [Redrafted Article 1 handed to M. Maisky and translatedto M. Stalin.] Then as regards Article 4 I suggested we take out the referenceto aggrandisement as there seemed to be some misunderstanding as to this last night and then Article 4 would be altered to read as follows [document handed to M. Maisky and translated to M. Stalin]. Then let me say a word about thefrontier question. What I had in mind was that we would sign here a docomentwhich would be a counterpart of the Atlantic Charter, a Moscow Charter, rather more specific than the Atlantic Charter and between our two Governmentsinstead of between my Government and the United States of America. Asregards the question of the future frontiers of Europe, this should, I think, bediscussed as soon as possible between the three Governments, that is, the U.S.S.R.,Great Britain and the United States of America, and I would write you a letteroffering to initiate these discussions at once not only on the question of the frontiers of the U.S.S.R. but on all European frontiers, and this is the sort ofletter which I.suggest I might write [copy of letter handed to M. Maisky andtranslated to M. Stalin].M. STALIN : [After having it read over to him again amendment to article 1.] I think with regard to this article we would be agreeable to includethe phrase that you suggest. So far as Article 4 is concerned, this should be inthe wording which I have submitted and in the letter all reference to the frontiers of the U.S.S.R. should be eliminated.Mr. EDEN : I see that you do not like my Article 4&apos; together with theletter as much as your own redraft of that article. My difficulty about your draft is that I am not clear what it really means. In my letter I say that we had theprinciples laid down in the Charter and will discuss between the three governments the actual frontiers proposed.   Your draft of Clause 4 either has
no definite meaning or else it means that we bind ourselves to agree to yourfrontiers as they were in 1941, and that is the proposition that we have already discussed at such length. I would like to have Article 4 in the form that I have submitted together with the letter which I propose.M. STALIN : That is difficult to accept.Mr. EDEN : I do not want to be anything but completely honest and openwith you. I do not want to cover up what is really a difference of opinion bywords which may be misunderstood, and I do not really know what your newArticle 4 is intended to cover.M. STALIN: In the new clause I have first of all added the word&apos;-&apos; Security.&quot;Mr. EDEN : I do not take any objection to that.  That is quite all right.M. STALIN: We have already discussed the necessity for &quot;the secondalteration, that in Article 4 We have spoken of the possibility, for instance, ofthe increase of the territory of Yugoslavia, and it seemed that you were notnecessarily against that. We also discussed the incorporation of East Prussiain Poland and the giving of certain islands to Greece and Turkey. And to none of these did you object. In fact, you accepted the necessity for increasing the territories of these countries. All we ask for is to restore our country to its former frontiers. We must have these for our security and safety; for instance,at Leningrad. I want to emphasise the point that, if you decline to do this, it looks as if you were creating a possibility for a dismemberment of the soviet union.Mr. EDEN : That is not in the least the case. If you were to ask me nowto give my signature for definite frontiers for any country, say, Greece orYugoslavia, or even Great Britain itself, I should have to refuse in exactly thesame way. I think you have probably a strong case on the ground of security,and I shall be glad to put it forward, as I said that I would do. But what I cannot do now is to put these definite frontiers into an agreement.M. STALIN: Let me point out that you are apparently prepared to sacrifice the two principles which were in your former text in Article 4, but i must insist that these should be left untouched, because there has been much talkin Europe of our intentions to Bolshevise Europe and to keep other people&apos;sterritory, &amp;c, so that I would like to have these principles clearly stated to removeall apprehension from people&apos;s minds on this point.Mr. EDEN: I, of course, have no objection to maintaining those twoprinciples. They are, in any event, covered by the reference to the atlantic charter. Supposing in Article 4 we were to insert these words : &quot; With full regard to the interests of both parties and to the security of their territoriesagainst further aggression.&quot; That seems to cover the point such as you mentionedwith regard to the security of Leningrad and covers your real need so far as security is concerned.M. STALIN : That is not enough.Mr. EDEN : I cannot say that I acknowledge your frontiers of 1941. I amsorry to appear to be so difficult, but the one thing I have undertaken not to do forany country, including our own, is to agree to definite frontiers after the warwithout consultation with the United States of America and the Dominions.M. MOLOTOV : I think that this would greatly facilitate the consultations with America.Mr. EDEN : If I were to ask them now to give me, an answer, I am sure itwould be: &quot;No; we must consider the matter,&apos;&apos; and I don&apos;t want to get thatanswer from them.M. STALIN: You may have your reasons, but our people, who are fightingwith such heavy losses at the front, losses in blood and tears, if they were to hearthis bargaining that is going on as to the restoration of our legitimate frontiers,it would make my position and M. Molotov&apos;s extremely difficult. We are fightingnot for the interests of the Roi de Prusse, but for our own frontiers.
Mr. EDEN : How could I explain this clause to the Poles ? They would inevitably read it as meaning that we had agreed that the U.S.S.R. should go backto the frontiers which they held immediately before the outbreak of their warwith Germany.SIR S. CRIPPS : Could we know whether the phrase &quot; Having full regard&quot;to the interests of the U.S.S.R. in the restoration of its frontiers,&quot; means the recognition by us of the U.S.S.R. frontiers of 1941 ?M. STALIN : Yes, it does mean the recognition of the right of the U.S.S.R.to their 1941 frontiers.Mr. EDEN : The Poles pressed me very hard at the time of their agreementwith the Soviet Union to agree with them upon their Eastern frontier, but Irefused. If I now agree to this Article I should, in fact, be agreeing to the Polishfrontier as it was in 1941.M. STALIN : This does not entail an agreement on the Polish frontier.This does not affect it and I would give a letter to make that quite clear.Mr. EDEN : Yes, but that is how it will be read throughout the world.M. STALIN : So far as the effect on public opinion is concerned, everyonewould ask the question whether Hitler was right in violating our frontiers whenhe started the war. The British Government is apparently hesitating about this,but I have no doubts about it, nor would the public.Mr. EDEN : I have no doubt about it either, but this agreement is anagreement upon the principles on which we would work together for peace now and after the war, and what you are now trying to do is to put into it a decision as to a particular portion of the frontiers of Europe.M. STALIN : After I observed last night such an uncertain attitude on thepart of the British Government as regards the situation in the Baltic states felt bound to introduce such a clause into the agreement.M. MOLOTOV : We are going to sign a treaty of mutual assistance oralliance and we must know what we are fighting for and where we stand.Mr. EDEN : We are fighting to beat Hitler. Quite apart from the questionof my right to make this agreement, if I signed it I should have any number of questions put to me as to its effect upon Poland, &amp;c, and what was its exactmeaning, and I could not, of course, disclose your private letter, but if youwanted me to put into my letter an acknowledgment of your views, I wouldcertainly be prepared to do that.M. STALIN : My letter as to the exclusion of the Polish frontiers wouldbe sent to General Sikorski, too, and I should be prepared to have it published as well.  My formula must stand.Mr. EDEN : I am afraid I cannot possibly accept it.M. STALIN : That is very regrettable.Mr. EDEN : I have tried very hard to meet you on this and I am preparedto do anything except to agree to definite frontiers, and I cannot do that withoutbreaking pledges I have already made to other people, and I am not going tobreak pledges.M. STALIN : It is a pity.Mr. EDEN : I now understand fully what the point of difficulty is, butit is not in my power to resolve it here and now. I will, however, do my bestwhen I get back to solve it in London. If we do not have these agreements itwill be a great pity and it certainly will not make my task in London any easier,but that position I shall have to accept. It might be wise to leave the matter over until to-morrow to see if we can find anything by way of a solution duringthe night, but I am afraid I do not see any prospect of that.M. STALIN:   Very well, I think that you should consult your PrimeMinister.    When he was in a, position to do so he attacked the ChamberlainGovernment very bitterly in 1939 for the course they pursued as to the Soviet[23309]        . - .;.&apos;.    . &apos;,, -   ; f  :
Uniom and it was just over this question of the Baltic States that negotiationsbroke down. I do not believe that the Prime Minister would object to signingthe agreement on these lines.Mr. EDEN : Unfortunately, the Prime Minister is on his way to America,the Cabinet is in London, and I am here, and it does not make consultationeasy. I am certain that the Prime Minister would take the same view as I do.These frontier questions are really a part of the peace treaty, and we have notyet reached the stage of agreeing what should go into it. I am quite certainthat the Prime Minister could not be more anxious to get this agreement concluded than I am.(Secret.)V.RECORD OF A MEETING BETWEEN THE FOREIGN SECRETARY ANDM. STALIN ON DECEMBER 20, 1941, AT 7 p.m.Present:Mr. Eden. M. Stalin.Sir S. Cripps. M. Molotov.Hon. Sir A. Cadogan. \   Part of the M. MaiskyLieut-General Nye.   J time.Mr. EDEN : I have received a telegram from the War Cabinet in replyto the enquiry which I addressed to them, and I should like to read this telegram to M. Stalin.[Foreign Office telegram No. 74, Haughty, of the 19th December was then. read out and translated by M. Maisky. ]The position is that, while I cannot put my signature to any agreement laying down a definite frontier, I am quite prepared to sign the first agreed text in theform of a treaty, the second text as originally proposed by M. Stalin, and theletter which I have already submitted to him. If that procedure meets withM. Stalin&apos;s approval, I would, of course, raise this question, as soon as I gotback to England, with His Majesty&apos;s Government, the Dominions governments and the Government of the United States of America, and I would try to get agreement upon the course to be pursued.M. STALIN : The first agreement is linked up with the second, and it isdifficult to detach the one from the other. I do not like the idea of transformingthe agreement subsequently into a treaty. When the agreement is concluded itwill have to be published, and to convert it thereafter into a treaty would giverise to a lot of talk and rumours it would, in fact, have the appearance of a sort of two-faced agreement. For this reason I think it better to postpone signature of the agreements. During the next two or three weeks you will no doubt havebeen able to consult the Governments concerned, and we can then sign a propertreaty, or two treaties, as the case may be.Mr. EDEN : So far as the question of treaty versus agreement is concerned,the position is that an agreement is just as binding on His Majesty&apos;s government as a treaty : it is only a question of form.M. STALIN : If the one is as valid as the other, you can surely sign a treatyjust as well as you can sign an agreement.Mr. EDEN : I have explained that this is a &quot; family difficulty&quot; of oursowing to the position of the Dominions Governments. I will, of course, fall in with whatever M. Stalin wants, but it seems to me a great pity to throw into the waste-paper basket these two treaties, which have been drafted by you and whichI am in a position to accept. If I fail to sign these agreements notwithstanding the hopes of my colleagues, it will make it more difficult for us to make progress with the agreements you want, and may adversely affect Anglo-Soviet relations.I could understand your attitude if. it were a fact that the agreements proposed
were such as to prejudice your position in the matter of frontiers, but this is notthe case, and it seems.to me that the agreements constitute a first step to getting the further agreements which you want. I suggest, therefore, that we should sign the agreements as drafted, and that I should give you as well the letter which I have proposed.&apos;:j M. STALIN : Whether the treaties are or are hot signed now, I am sure that Anglo-Soviet relations will improve, since the progress of the war compelsthe two countries to draw closer and closer together. The war is also compellingmany countries to discard their prejudices and preconceived views, and ourrelations will assuredly improve. I do not think that failure to sign the treatiesnow should be regarded in too tragic a light. If the treaty is signed in london in two or three weeks&apos; time, it will come to much the same thing. Our relationswill be based on the July agreement, and they will become closer. I should perhaps have been in a position to sign the agreements, with slight modifications of wording, if we had not had these discussions about the frontier. Thediscussions revealed a situation which I never expected to find. I remember thatEngland had an alliance with Tsarist Russia, which included Finland,Bessarabia and half of Poland. To the best of my recollection no Englishstatesman at that time raised any difficulties about this alliance on the grounds that these territories were included in Tsarist Russia. Now, however, it seems that the question of the Finnish frontier and that of the Baltic States is astumbling-block.!; I proposed the inclusion of protocols to the agreements, but you objected to this, so we dropped the protocols. Next, we dropped our insistence on thecreation of a second front, for the reasons you put forward and which we quiteunderstood. Finally, there was the question of Petsamo and operations in theNorth : lam not quite clear as to the present position about this. But, in viewof the successive concessions which I have mentioned, we must have compensation of some sort, and that compensation should take the form of the recognition ofour frontiers.Me. EDEN : I am very glad to hear what you say about Anglo-soviet relations and your view that these are going to improve, and I am all the moreglad to hear it because in your message to the Prime Minister you said that relations were not good and that the questions of mutual military assistance and post-war reconstruction must be cleared up before any improvement could be hoped for. That is why I came out here to deal with these two points. Asregards the question of the frontiers, I do not regard this as an obstacle to thedevelopment of our future relations, and I have tried hard to explain ourposition on more than one occasion. Since we have been at war we have pledgedourselves to the United States of America not to conclude any agreement onfrontier matters, and that is why I suggested leaving this question until I gotback to London and could put it to the United States Government. The main point is that these agreements, as drafted, in no way prejudice the Soviet Govern-ment&apos;s territorial claims; on the contrary, they would help to further them.! As regards the second point, I have received news that the position is veryserious at Hong Kong.[Mr. Eden here.quoted from telegrams received.] The position in Malayais also very serious, and we are doing our utmost to send reinforcements,- but itmay be difficult or impossible to get these reinforcements to their destinations.In these circumstances, it would have been a help if the Soviet Union could haverelieved the pressure on us. All the Japanese air forces are now concentratedagainst us and the Americans. I understand that you cannot help us in the far east for the reasons you have given me, and for the same reasons we cannot helpyou by the creation of a second front. One of the divisions which we hoped mightform the basis of a British force to be sent to South Russia has now had to be diverted to Malaya.As regards Petsamo, I want to make it quite clear that we are willing to dowhatever we can, and I should like to discuss this matter further and come tosome arrangement about it if it can be done. We must first know what is required of us before we can tell whether it is within our power.M. STALIN :  As regards my message to the Prime Minister to which you referred, I said in this message that Anglo^Soviet relations were not clear,[23309] F 2
and that this lack of clarity was due to the absence of any treaty on war aims and the organisation of the post-war peace. I added that clarity on these pointswould improve our relations. If clarity were not achieved it might prejudice our relations and be a bar to mutual confidence. In my message I did not raisethe question of sending someone to Moscow; all I wanted was to improve andclarify relations. This could have been done either in London or Moscow. but mr. Churchill offered to send you to Moscow, and this I naturally welcomed. -Consequently, the reproach that you have made so long a journey for nothing is not quite justified.Mr. EDEN: Not a reproach, but an expression of disappointment.M. STALIN : I, too, am disappointed that we could not come to anagreement.As regards your repeated references to the necessity for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to consult the United States Government, I must confess that I hadoverlooked this fact and had believed your Government to have more freedomof action in these matters. That is perhaps why it is difficult now to reach anagreement. I do not feel in the least hurt or offended that you cannot establish a second front or send troops to the U.S.S.R. I sent my message of the8th November at a time when your situation was better and mine was worse.I do not now insist on your sending troops to the U.S.S.R., and certainly I donot feel hurt about it as it appears to be impossible. If you could agree to mysuggestion regarding Petsamo I should welcome it, and should regard yourdecision as a fulfilment of the military agreement.Mr. EDEN: As regards the question of the agreements, I do not press forthis Anglo-Soviet relations are more important than agreements. I shall dropthat question now, and when I get back to London I shall see what can be done about it.  It would serve no purpose to continue the argument about it now.M. STALIN : I thank you for your kind promise to do what you can on your return to London. I think that an improvement will take place in the notvery distant future, and I should like to contribute to it as far as I can.Mr. EDEN : As regards Petsamo, I should like to know exactly what isrequired, and I suggest that General Nye should see someone on the SovietGeneral Staff and obtain full particulars to-morrow. Then we can go into thematter again and let you know our decision. We should like to help as regardsPetsamo if it can be done.M. STALIN : Yes, such a meeting would be helpful.Mr. EDEN : General Nye is here : shall I tell him that that is the position ?M. STALIN :   Certainly.    He can meet the Chief or Vice-Chief of theGeneral Staff to-night or to-morrow.Mr. EDEN : As regards the Par East I expect that, in view of the veryserious situation, the Prime Minister will want to know your exact position.I understand you to say that you cannot do anything now but that in the Springthe position will be, or may be, different % Have I got this right, or how exactlydid you put it ?M. STALIN : If the Soviet Union were to declare war on Japan, we shouldhave to wage a real war by land, on sea and in the air. It would not be like the declarations of war on Japan by Belgium and Poland. Consequently we have tomake a careful estimate of the forces involved. At present we are not ready.A considerable number of our troops were removed from the Far East to theWestern front. New troops are being got ready but we shall require about four months before they are fully prepared. I think it would be far better for theSoviet Union if Japan were left to attack us. This would create a better politicaland psychological atmosphere amongst the Soviet people. War would be unpopular with our people if the Soviet Government were to fake the first step.If, on the other hand, we were attacked, the feelings of the Soviet people wouldbe very strong. We have seen this in the present war in the West. Hitlerattacked us, and because we were attacked the Soviet people have shown awonderful unity and great heroism and readiness to sacrifice themselves. Wewould prefer that Japan should attack us, and I think it very probable that she
will do so not just yet, but later. If the Germans are hard pressed it is likely that they will urge the Japanese to attack us, in which case the attack may beexpected about the middle of next year.Me. EDEN : I fear that the Japanese may meanwhile adopt a policy ofdealing with their opponents one by one, and may try to finish with us beforeattacking the Soviet Union.M. STALIN : Great Britain is not fighting Japan alone. She has allies inChina, the Dutch East Indies and the United States of America.Me. EDEN : The main attack at the moment is on Malaya, where our alliescannot help us much.M. STALIN : Cannot China help ?Mr. EDEN: General Wavell has gone to Chungking. The ChineseGovernment have offered to help, but I think their difficulty is a lack of offensiveweapons, and we cannot help them much now in that respect.M. STALIN : Do you think the Chinese want to fight?Mr. EDEN : They say they do.M. STALIN : They are doing nothing. I should like the talks about theFar Eastern situation to be resumed in the Spring, when we shall be moreprepared for them. I believe that the Japanese will attack us earlier, and then the position will be clarified.Mr. EDEN: The way in which you could help us most would be to let us have submarines. We have none in the Far East. The Netherlands Governmenthave a few, but we are having a very unpleasant time of it fighting a warwithout the control of the seas.M. STALIN : Have the Netherlands East Indies no fleet ?Mr. EDEN: They have about 15 submarines and a few light cruisers. Ourweakness is in capital ships, and submarines.M. STALIN : It is very easy to make submarines, and in six months&apos; timeyou and America, with your productive capacity, will have a preponderance in them.Mr. EDEN : We must do all we can to bring this about.M. STALIN : The Libyan campaign must be finished, and it would be verynice to press on to Bizerta. Do you think it would be immoral to occupy Bizerta ?Would it be a violation of democratic morals ? Vernon Bartlett would be disappointed and opposed to any such action, but that wouldn&apos;t &apos;t matter much.Mr. EDEN : When democracy is at war most things have a knack of becoming moral.  We shot up the French fleet at Oran.M. STALIN : That was quite right. War has its own logic the logic ofa life and death struggle and you can occupy any point without scruple.Mr. EDEN : We have occupied Timor in the last two days.M. STALIN : Well done !   The Japanese would have done so if you had not.Mr. EDEN : The Libyan campaign is going quite well, and we have already taken about 10,000 prisoners, 4,000 of them Germans.M. STALIN : The Germans do not surrender to us, or only a very few ofthem. At Klin we offered them quarter under the white flag, but they rejectedour offer in a written message from the German burgomaster of the town, so wehad no alternative but to destroy them.  The same thing happened at Kalinin.Mr. EDEN: Thank you for letting us visit Klin. We saw a few german prisoners, and were very much impressed by their wretched appearance and clothing, which was quite unsuitable for winter conditions.M. STALIN : Hitler said in October that they were quite prepared for awinter campaign.
Mr. EDEN : The next six months are going to be difficult. We have got tostick it out, and we shall do so But it is a very uncomfortable situation. you may like to know that I have received a telegram from.the Chiefs of Staff sayingthat we shall go through with the Libyan campaign and shall not call it off inorder to send reinforcements to the Far East. The Far East must hold out until we can afford to send reinforcements.M. STALIN : I think that is quite sound. The weakest link of the Axisis Italy, and if this link is broken the whole Axis will collapse. If the Britishhad attacked Italy in 1939, or before then, they would now be masters of thesituation in the Mediterranean.Mr. EDEN : We were bluffed.M. STALIN : Certain democratic illusions prevented your taking action in1939 or earlier %Mr. EDEN : Perhaps partly illusions, but partly a gross over-estimate ofItaly&apos;s strength. You may like to know that the Germans and Italians are tryingvery hard to send reinforcements to Libya. They sent four ships, escorted bybattleships, cruisers and destroyers. We made contact with them and went into action, but lost them in the dark. The escorting ships must have comprised alarge part of the Italian navy. We believe that they were escorting german troops, and that that is why the escort was so large.M. STALIN: The Italians are fighting very badly on-our front, andaccording to prisoners we have taken the Germans treat them like niggers and very often shoot them. In time, Italy will get sick of such an alliance withGermany.Mr. EDEN : The prisoners we saw said that their clothes were no worse than those of their comrades.M. STALIN: Except for the S.S., who are better clothed. But there areonly a few S.S. regiments.[The discussion then turned to the question of issuing a communiqueregarding Mr. Edeirs visit, and M. Stalin produced the draft textcontained in telegram No. 34. HECTIC, of the 20th December. Seetext at Annex X to Document I.](Secret.)VI.RECORD  OF  FAREWELL MEETING  BETWEEN  THE  foreign secretary AND M. STALIN ON DECEMBER 22, 1941, AT 5 p.m.ON Monday, the 22nd December, the Secretary of State, accompanied bySir Alexander Cadogan and General Nye, called on M. Stalin for a farewellinterview at 5 p.m. at the Kremlin.  M. Molotov and M. Maisky were also present.Mr. EDEN began by expressing his thanks for the kindly reception givento the Delegation and the excellent hospitality extended to them by the SovietGovernment.M. STALIN enquired about the situation in the Far East, and the Secretaryof State gave him the latest available news. M. Stalin expressed the opinion ithat it would have been best to attempt to hold Kowdoon, and he asked whetherthe Chinese could not have given effective assistance. It was explained to him that the Chinese had not been in a position to do much, and that without air superiority it was impossible to hold the leased territory. There was only on every inadequate aerodrome that we could use.Speaking of the Chinese, M. Stalin said that they were good fighters, butlacked powers of organisation. It would be a good thing to send in british officers to train and organise them;
GENERAL NYE said that a number of British Officers had been held ready,and should have gone into China on the outbreak of war. Moreover, general wavell should now be in Chungking.M. STALIN : As proof that the Chinese did not resent help from the out-side, M. Stalin said that some time ago the Chinese had asked him to send a russian army corps, to form the nucleus of a Russo-Chinese army. He thoughtthat, if we could help the Chinese to organise a force of 10 to 15 divisions onmodern lines, we should get a very good return.Mr. EDEN agreed, but referred to the difficulty of getting the requisitematerial into China.Mr. Eden gave M. Stalin a summary of the latest news of the Libyancampaign.M. STALIN expressed satisfaction, and the hope that we should press the campaign to a conclusion. He had no confidence himself in the French, and hoped to see us, if it were possible, pressing on to Bizerta.Asked how he interpreted Hitler&apos;s dismissal of General Brauchitsch,M. Stalin said that in his view it altered little. In actual fact, Hitler hadbeen in command the whole time. Things had gone wrong, and he had had tofind a scapegoat, and had hit on General Brauchitsch.Summarising the results of the last few days&apos; conversations, M. Stalin saidwe had to acknowledge that there had been, on both sides, a considerable degreeof mistrust, but he believed that these conversations had gone very far to dispelit, and he looked forward to their good results.Mr. EDEN heartily endorsed these sentiments, and the party then tookleave of M. Stalin and M. Molotov. Mr. Eden expressed the hope that it mightbe possible one day to welcome M. Molotov in London.M. STALIN, in saying good-bye, asked Mr. Eden to convey to the PrimeMinister his greetings, and his thanks for the latter&apos;s birthday message to him.
