In view of the importance of the. forthcoming Man-Power Debate in theHouse of Commons, I wish to submit for the consideration of the Cabinet theform of the statement to be made.2.     I suggest it should consist Of -&apos; ....   &apos;I - A comprehensive review.of-the policy that has been adopted and thesuccessive steps taken since the present Government^ took office with regard to the calling-up of men for the Forces aha the supplyof labour-for industry.This has never been done and is in my view overdue.II - A statement of the-results achieved so far as they can befmade publicIII - A statement of the position disclosed by the man-power survey sofar as it, can be stated publicly.IV - The steps which the Government propose to take to meet the situation.The statement under this head should include the following announcements(l) The introduction of legislation imposing on all persons of eithersex aged 18 to 60 a liability to national service, either in the armed Forces, in Civil Defence or in Industry.It should be explained that the Bill will contain a generaldeclaratory clause to the above effect and will amend the NationalService Acts to extend the military age for men from-41 to 60 andto make them applicable to women.     At the same time the defence regulations will be amended by Order in Council to enable persons to be called up for whole or part-time service in Civil Defence andfor part-time service in the Armed Forces (i.e. Home Guard).It should further be explained that men above the age of 4-1 will notbe called up for general service, but for non-combatant andsedentary duties and that women will have all the statutory safe-guards of the National Service Acts, i.e. conscientious objection,-hardship etc that it is proposed to proclaim the 20-25 age groups,that married women will be exempt from calling-up for the Forces,that women will not be required to use lethal weapons unless theyvolunteer to do so, and that so far as practicable they will be posted near their homes.(2) The calling-up for the Armed Forces of young men aged 18gr*It should be announced that the first half of the 1923,-cJlass will be registered on Saturday, 13th December, and their caliing-up begun in January next, and that special steps will be taken to observe the spirit of the Government pledge that youths under 20 will notbe sent overseas.
(3) The replacement of the system of block reservation byoccupation by a system of individual deferment.It should be explained that the transition will take placegradually and will be effected by raising the age of reserva-tion for all occupations by one year at a time at monthly intervals commencing on 1st January next, individual defermentbeing granted only to men engaged on work of national importance.ft should also be explained that the existing defermentmachinery of the Ministry of Labour will be developed by further decentralising it into 45 Districts and establishing45 District Boards to give decisions on individual defermentjand that the scheme will have the two-fold object of transferringmen from less essential work to more essential work and ofobtaining men for the Armed Forces.(4) The drastic review of existing deferments.Steps have already been taken to cancel the deferment of allpersons under 25,- except in certain &quot;scarcity&quot; categories;&quot;other deferments will be reviewed by the District Boards.(5) The continuation^ of fortnightly regis.tr.ations of&apos;women by age groups up to age 40 and&quot; including the 19 and 20 year olds.It should be stated that in order to intensify the pace at which .women are moved to vital war work the instructions containedin the Appendix to W.P.
