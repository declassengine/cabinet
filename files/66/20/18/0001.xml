THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1941.SECRET.w.P. (41) 295.December 1, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SPANISH PROPOSAL TO ACQUIRE 300,000 TONS OFFRENCH SHIPPING.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.A SCHEME has been under discussion since August last between theSpanish and French authorities for the transfer to the Spanish flag of 300,000tons of French shipping now idle in the Mediterranean. The reason for theproposal probably is that these ships are mainly oil burning, and the french have no oil. Part of the tonnage transferred would then be used in the Frenchinterest. The Spaniards seem always to have insisted that the ships, if acquired,should ply strictly in accordance with our regulations, i.e., with navicerts,and the French seem to have accepted this under the impression that we mightgrant navicerts for trade to unoccupied France as well as to North Africa. Thereis, of course, no foundation whatever for this belief, and His Majesty&apos;s embassy at Madrid have been instructed to make this clear to the Spaniards.The view of the departments concerned is that it would be desirable toremove this large block of tonnage from the Mediterranean provided there were no benefit to the enemy, and it is suggested that the proposed deal should thereforereceive British approval on the following conditions : *(a) the ships operating in the French interest should only ply betweenAmerica and French North Africa under arrangements agreed byus, or engage in such other Colonial trade as we may from time totime agree to;(&amp;) ships at present in North, South or Central American ports, includingtankers in the French West Indies, should not be part of the deal;(c) no Spanish ship of over 750 tons should engage in trade with france or enemy or enemy-controlled territory;(d) no Spanish ship should in future be transferred or chartered for morethan single voyages to enemy or to French citizens or to companiesunder enemy or French control;(e) no French ship chartered by Spain should enter the Mediterranean orproceed East of Corunna along the North coast of Spain;(/) the transferred ships must take out ships&apos; navicerts;(g) payment should be made in dollars into the special account of the FrenchGovernment in New York, which is allowed to be used for payments for supplies for French North Africa;(h) His Majesty&apos;s Government should be offered some shipping advantage in the shape of an arrangement to put Spanish tonnage into servicesbeneficial to us up to an agreed amount.11569   [23215]IV
2It is most unlikely that the parties would agree to all these conditions,even supposing that His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Governmentallowed trading with French North Africa to be resumed. The Spaniards have,however, asked for our views, and it is accordingly proposed to despatch to madrid the draft telegram annexed to this paper.A. E.Foreign Office, December 1, 1941.ANNEX.Draft Telegram to His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Ambassador, Madrid.YOUR telegram No. 1526 of the 28th October : Proposed transfer of Frenchshipping to Spanish flag.As explained in telegram No. 1663, Arfar, of 3rd September, we wereprepared to consider agreeing to the transfer on certain admittedly stringentterms in view of the advantage of getting these ships out of the Mediterranean.Negotiations between the French and the Spaniards appear, however, to havebeen conducted on the basis of a false assumption, namely, that there is some prospect of our allowing a part of the ships to be used for supplying MetropolitanFrance. We have no such intention. It is true that supplies are reaching france in escorted convoys, but this is because we cannot at present prevent it. It is our policy to stop, not widen, this leak in the blockade.2. If negotiations proceed in spite of the communication which you were instructed to make in Arfar telegram No. 2106 of 2nd November, you may informthe Spaniards that we would agree to the transfer on the conditions set out inArfar telegram No. 1429 of 28th July, but you should also make it clear initiallythat we should require as a condition of our consent some shipping advantage in the form of an arrangement to put Spanish tonnage into services beneficial to us up to an agreed amount. You should start by asking 100,000 tons or one-third of the amount of tonnage covered by the Franco-Spanish Arrangement.3. If, as is possible, we stop issuing navicerts for French North Africa asa result of political developments, our conditions will leave little possibility ofthe French using their share of the shipping in trade with French territory. If,in spite of this, negotiations continue, you should keep me informed.
