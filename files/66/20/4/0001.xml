R E T. ^/ COPY . MO. r-J CjW.P.(41) 282. ?24TH NOVEMBER, 1941.WAR   CABINET,REPORT ON VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD PRIVY SEAL,The Prime Minister has asked me to circulate tomy colleagues some impressions and conclusions derivedfrom my recent journey across the Atiantic3   A few wordsare needed by way of introductionI was in the United States from the 25th ofOctober to the 14th of November with the exception of the1st to the 4th of November when I visited Canada,,My time in the States was divided betweenWashington and New York,    Besides attending the I.L.O.Conference and visiting two munition plants I devoted mytime to making contact with as many people as possible.I had two long talks with the President,    I also sawseparately every member of his Cabinet and was greatly impressed with their helpfulness and active goodwill aI also conversed with Judges, Senators,, officials bothBritish and American, publicists, and Labour leaders bothA.P. of L. and C . 1.0.In Canada I visited Parliament,  an Air training centre,  and Munitions works and had talks with the PrimeMinister and most of his Cabinet, with the High commissioner and the leading British officials, and with the governor general.The impressions and conclusions set out belowwhich I have recorded as briefly as possible are thereforederived from a number of sources and are subject to the limitations of my judgment in assessing the value of theinformation received and to the restricted time and geographical scope of my visits1*    The I.L.O. Conferencep    The proceedings of theConference have&quot;already been reported briefly.    Theimportant points to be noted were:  the unanimity of the delegations from thirty-five nations representingemployers and wo inkers as well as Governments,  the factthat the Conference was addressed by the President, andthe passing, on the motion of the U.S. delegation, of aresolution affirming the victory of the Preo Peoples as anessential condition for the realisation of the ideals ofthe I.L.O., and providing for investigation into post war economic.and social problems by that body in co-operationwith Governments and other organisationsa    It was

noteworthy that the neutral South American delegationssupported this as strongly as did those of &quot;belligerentcountries.    Arrangements were made for a Free french representative to address the Conference and an invitationwas extended to the U.S.S^R., &quot;but time did not allow forthe receipt of a reply.    The sending of a Cabinet Ministerto the Conference was much appreciated,)    I kept close contact with the Representatives for the Dominions,2*   Public Opinion in America.   jlhere was agreement among all those whom I met that American public opinion wasmoving forward steadily in favour of participation in thewar and had shown considerable advance in the last fewweeks.-   There is a time lag of some weeks between the-East and the West except the Far West, but the movement is general.   Nevertheless the War does not absorb morethan a very small part of the attention of the ordinarycitizen.    Interventionist sentiment is probably strongestin the working classes..    Isolationism is still fairlystrong but declining.    Much of its support is derivednot from persons who are really isolationist, hut fromhaters of the President, haters of England (mainly a section of the Irish) and persons under enemy influence.The line of German propaganda is to admit their ownfaults, but to claim that Britain is equally bad, and thatthe war is a contest between the tyrec    Many men of judgmentconsider that opinion is now ahead of the President&apos;section.    It is certainly ahead of the Senators andCongressmen who think in terms of a possible futureelection.    There is considerable anxiety in America as tothe food situation in Britain which is expressed to one by working people.    Many people cannot understand why foodsent under lease and lend, is not distributed free.    Thereis growing faith in our victory but a desire is expressed to know the means by which it is to be attained^   though there is increasing appreciation of the Americanos own interest in the war, undoubtedly the greatest single factor in Influencing opinion has been British resistance to air attack.The feeling against Japan is very strong andintervention in the Far East would meet with little opposition.3.    British Propaganda.    It is generally agreed that ourown friends in America are our best propagandistsa    It isa mistake to send out a large number of persons to makegeneralised speeches to public meetings,.    While apersonality may be effective for a few weeksy no one whohas been out of Britain for Ions is any good.    Specialisedspeakers  on the other hand addressing their oppositenumbers   are effective, e*g\. The Master of the Rolls withlawyers, Will Lawther and Jack Jones with miners or other groups of workers.    Generally speaking if our case is fairly put to the leaders of any section of Americansociety they will cause it to permeate the rank and file..The numbers of British in the States whetherofficial or. unofficial (apart from children)  should bekept to a minimum.    There are still too many titledpeople whose presence does harm,    There are too many youngmen.    There are some rich idlers whosedu Lid/mental effect is out of all proportion to their numbers;,Above all&quot;no one should be allowed to visitAmerica whether in an official capacity or otherwiseunless he or she likes the American people,.    Those who donot are soon found out and arc thereafter useless andprobably harmful.    Owing to the publicity given in our ownS -

communiques to the part taken in the fighting hy troops from the Dominions, Poland and&apos;other countries and to american flying men,  there is anjdea that the British are doing none of the fighting.    This is most prejudicial.    i suggest that steps should &quot;be taken to correct this.We should endeavour to get rid of the &quot;Aid to britain&quot; atmospheree    Our common interest in the victory of democracy should he the theme *-4.    British Missions.,    There appeo.r to he too many ofthese and also too many persons connected with them.    Ithas a had effect,  in an already overcrowded city such asWashington,  to have so many British.    I understand that a treasury official is engaged in cutting staffs.    I suggestthat he should he instructed to hear in mind the pointmentioned ahove of ability to get on with Americans.    Itwas suggested from several quarters that it would he desirable to appoint someone of ministerial rank to hehead of all the British Missions under the Ambassador. Theposition would ho somewhat similar to&apos;that held hy LordNortlieiiffe and lord Reading in the last war. Fraction is farmcro often generated on the lower plane ^tween departmentalofficials than between heads.    The absence of collective responsibility of American Ministers tends to their departmentsfollowing separate and sometimes contradictory policies; hence the desirability of a co-ordinating imo,a r-r. o\-r side. A memberof the U.S. Cabinet suggested to me that Ministers werenot approached sufficiently and that too much was left to official contacts lower down.    There was generalappreciation of the heads of our missions05.   Production^    From my limited observation productionseemed now to he-accelerating satisfactorily.    I was shownencouraging graphs hy the head of the Production Office.There was some apprehension as to the effect of theLabour disturbances on the programmes    I was advised notto take the strike situation too tragically.    It must heremembered that Labour relations in America are comparable to those in this country forty years ago,Many trade unionists and most employers arecomparatively unacquainted with the ordinary methods of collective bargaining which obtain here.    In particularthere are very few employers&apos;  organisations while labour is still split on the craft versus industrial unionquestion.    The continuance of the &quot;frontier attitude&quot; in american life together with the existing judicial and police system makes resort to violence more frequent thanin countries with a more settled tradition.    I was assuredhy leaders of both union organisations that the hulk oftheir members were solidly: behind the war productioneffort.6.    Post war problemsThere is a very keen interest in post&quot; war problems both among the general public and amongCabinet Ministers.    The Atlantic Charter has set out theprinciples upon v/hich the Free Peoples intend to proceed.It would not be wise in my view to seek tc elahorate these principles in a public statement or document.    Too muchconcentration on post v/ar problems affords an    opportunityfor those who will not face up to war to salve theirconsciences by planning a new world.    On the other hand,it is essential that we should not leave this work to others*    It cannot be postponed   till after the war asmuch of it is i^xtriotfoly bound up with immediateproblems of relief, etc,    Those who support the President

in the U.S.A. are also those most concerned with thesequestions.There is also a large body of opinion in thedominions and at home, comprising people of all political...... -faiths, who desire to he assured that work on the methodsof application of the principles of the Atlantic Charteris proceeding.    This view was expressed by importantMinisters and was constantly voiced at the I.L.O.Conference.    I think that there is danger of friction ifthese matters are approached only through &quot;discussion orcorrespondence on the official level.    It would in my view be far easier to obtain agreement through Ministerialcontacts.    In talking with Ministers specially interested^such as the Vice President,  the Secretary of State andMr. Welles,  I did not find it difficult to agree with themin their general approach to post war problems, such associal security and nutrition.    I gathered that thePresident while very interested was necessarily toooccupied with immediate problems to give his attention todetails but expected his Ministers to proceed on thegeneral lines already approved so that proposals fully considered might be brought before him in due course.    Itwould       in my opinion be useful if the Minister without portfolio and Vice President Wallace were to be the mainchannels of communication on all questions concerning orclosely connected with post war social and economic problems on behalf of the two Governments.It is, I think, most desirable that the american people should get accustomed to thinking of themselves asbound, through the facts of the situation, to take a big-share of responsibility for the postwar settlement and asjointly concerned v/ith us to maintain the democratic wayof life.     The more they envisage the end the more must they provide the means.7. In Canada I visited the Uplands Air TrainingStation which struck me as highly efficient and of value,apart .from its technical side,  in providing a meeting place for picked young men from Britain,the Dominions and theU.S.A.      There was much more awareness of the war in&apos;Canada than in the U.S.A.. and ordinary life hasp of course,been   .  much more interfered with.      I talked at consider-able length with Mr. King and his colleagues on labour questions which are not dissimilar to those in the UnitedStates.     The two. &quot;works which I visited impressed mefavourably.     The general.spirit of determination among all the people I met in Canada was admirable.8. I was able to see something of the work on the U.S.bases at Bermuda which is proceeding very rapidly.      Ihad ample evidence, of the cordial co-operation betweenthe British and American Services and of the absence of friction.     The civil Government is also co-operating well.9* While I received every courtesy and facility in thecourse of my journeys to and from America,  I cannot stresstoo strongly the need for developing to the utmost ourown means of communication.     At present important peoplelose much time in transit.     Others-less important except to themselves lose more time and temper^     Diplomatic bagsand other communications are delayed.(Intld-,) C.R.A.
