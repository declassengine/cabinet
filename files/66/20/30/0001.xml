(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY73 GOVERNMENT).SECRET.W.P.(hl)  307.29th DECEMBER.  19^1.COMMAND IN THE SOUTH WEST PACIFIC,Report hy the Chiefs of Staff,We have a good many doubts about the scheme as awhole, but since the Prime Minister and our delegates in washington have been convinced that it is a war-winner,we think it probable that many of our ioubts would bedispelled if we had an opportunity of discussing it withthe authors.      In any case we feel that things have goneao far that we have no alternative but to advise HisMajesty&apos;s Government to approve the scheme in principle.In these circumstances all that we have felt able to dois to invite attention to those features of the schemeabout which we are in doubt, and to put up suggestions whichmay be helpful to the Prime Minister and our delegates in washington.2m The scheme shows a tendency towards arearesponsibility rather than world-wide strategic      Ineffect, it establishes a body to control the war against japan, and does not establish a similar body to control the war against Germany.      Nor does it provide for anyoverriding body which will be responsible for the strategy of the war as a whole,  and for allocating theallied resources in men and material to the varioustheatres.     We think that such a body is essential.3. We have disctissed the composition of the &quot;jointbody&quot; in Washington and we are not clear as to what isintended.     We consider a military side to be essential,but we infer from the telegram that a poli+ic-il side isalso intended.      This would be valuable and we suggestthat it should be on similar lines to that, set up in theMiddle East.      The military representatives should besubordinate to the Chiefs of Staff in this country.      Itis most important that they should not be &quot;Henry Wilsons&quot;.We think that it would be necessary to have representatives on this joint body of those Allies and of the Dominionsinterested in the South-West Pacific Area.

h* With regard to the sphere of  this Command, wethink that there is much to he said for the exclusion of burma.     Its main &quot;base is India and its only port lies in the Indian Ocean and thus not under the Supreme Command,On the whole, therefore, we think that the &quot;balance is against including Burma until the position is stabilisedor offensive action in that part of the theatre is possibleWe are strongly of the opinion that the whole ofAustralia should be included in this Commands      It isthe main base and it would not be advisable to includepart of the country only in the Command.-5. With reference to the staff of the supreme commander, we consider that it should be a combined staffof the three Services,  and the Allies and dominions should be represented on it.     We note that it isproposed to have an American Deputy Commander-in-Chief0We are agreeable to the Headquarters being at Surabaya.We do not see that there wil 1 be any scope underthe new arrangements for either Mr., L*uff Cooper and hisDefence Council or for General PownaM as Commander-m-ChiefPar East.We do not think that an Act .ng Commander-in-ChiefIndia is a good solution.      There should be a permanentincumbent and the Chief of Imperial General Staff will consider with the Secretary of State for India who shouldbe appointed.(Signed)      A,F, BROOKE,W.R.    FREEMAN,VoCoAaSoH.R.  MOORE.,Great George Street, S*W.1*,29th December, 19*4-1.
