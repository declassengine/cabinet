Act  ^   H 1^1.        S .    jUw .THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.SECRET.W.P. (41) 288.   (Revise.)November 29, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.FORTHCOMING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT is important that the limits of the discussions which it is proposed thatI should have with Stalin in Moscow should be defined in advance and their objectives fixed. For this purpose it is desirable that two memoranda should be approved before I leave, dealing respectively with the political and militarysubjects which will form the basis of my conversations with Stalin. It is forconsideration whether these memoranda should actually be communicated toStalin.2. Political Memorandum. We have to aim at exorcising certain suspicionsin Stalin&apos;s mind.  These appear to be (a) That we wish to exclude Russia from what we should like to be an anglo-American scheme for peace, and post-war settlement;(b) That in making peace we shall ignore Russian interests; and(c) That we are not really ready at the peace settlement to take sufficientlydrastic measures against Germany to render her harmless for manyyears to come.3. A draft of the proposed political memorandum is attached hereto(Annex I). It covers the following subjects, on all of which we have reason to suppose Stalin will wish to explore our views : (a) Joint declaration of policy.In order to meet the three grounds of suspicion referred to in the preceding paragraph, we should invite the Soviet Government to agree in general terms ina joint declaration reaffirming the intention of the two countries to continue thewar until the defeat of Germany, and declaring mutual agreement to collaboratenot only in the peace settlement, but also in maintaining that settlement and inthe planning of post-war reconstruction. Such a declaration should endorse the atlantic Charter and the passages in Stalin&apos;s speech of the 6th Novemberregarding Soviet war aims.   A draft is attached (Annex II).(b) Non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. &quot; -The proposed declaration should also embody a mutual undertaking not tointerfere in each other&apos;s internal affairs or in those of other nations.11558   [23195]Copy No.
2(c) Disarmament of Germany.We should be ready to discuss with the Soviet Government means of effectingand maintaining the disarmament of Germany as forecast in the Atlantic Charter.(d) Post-ivar reconstruction and co-ordination of post-war economic policy generally.We ought to be able in our memorandum to invite the Soviet Government toparticipate at the appropriate moment in all discussions on the subject both now and in the future. But Soviet participation in particular discussions, such asinternational commodity schemes and those to be conducted by the I.L.O., willrequire the concurrence of the United States Government.(e) Possibility of British assistance in the economic rehabilitation of Russia.We cannot do more than undertake to examine the possibilities in collabora-tion with the United States Government.(f) Reparations and restitution.His Majesty&apos;s Government have not made up their own minds yet on thesubject, but it lodks as though the Soviet Government would press for some formof &quot;restitution,&quot; since they have told us that they consider that if they haveto destroy their fleet they will require the Germans to make it up to them out ofthe German fleet. Again, in conversation with Lord Beaverbrook Stalin asked :&quot; What about getting the Germans to pay for the damage?&quot; The Treasury andother departments concerned have embarked on a preliminary examination of thisquestion, but no progress has yet been made in the formulation of any definite policy. The matter will now have to be expedited because our politicalmemorandum must contain some expression of the views and intentions of HisMajesty&apos;s Government on this subject.For the present-all that we can say to the Soviet Government is that HisMajesty&apos;s Government recognise the justice of requiring Germany to makerestitution as far as possible for the spoliation of which she has been guiltyduring the course of the war but that His Majesty&apos;s Government will desire toexamine and discuss this subject further with the Soviet Government at a later stage when circumstances make it easier than the present to reach definite conclusions.(g) Strengthening of the lesser European States through the creation of FederalUnits.It will be seen from Sir S. Cripps&apos;s telegram No. 122 of the 17th november that he attaches significance to the fact that reference has been made in theSoviet Press to the mention hy President Benes of the proposed confederationbetween the Czechs and Poles with which, the President said, the U.S.S.R.&quot;ought to conclude a treaty.&quot;We have been considering for some time how we could promote the confederation-tion of various minor Powers so that they would be strong enough, bothstrategically and economically, to be able to maintain themselves against pressure from Germany, or any other aggressive great Power. The most promising field for such a development is, of course, in Eastern Europe. The Polish andCzechoslovak Governments are already discussing&apos; the methods by which theycould achieve such closer union after the war and have made some progress.The Greek and Yugoslav Governments are discussing a similar arrangement for the Balkans. We have already encouraged these developments and have been considering for some time how far we should encourage such federal arrangements and propose their extension to other territories. Our memorandum shoulddefinitely advocate the encouragement of such confederations as will corresponds to strategic and economic necessities.(h) Our Obligations to the United States of America and our Allies.We must make it clear that account will have to be taken of thesethroughout the discussions.
4. Other questions affecting the Peace Settlement. There are other questions which are not yet ripe for inclusion in the proposed memorandum, but which we must be prepared to discuss with the Soviet Government if they raisethem.   The chief of these are the following :- (a) The question of the fate of Germany.It may be necessary to be prepared to exchange ideas with theRussians on this subject. Sir S. Cripps has warned us that the SovietGovernment may have definite plans for the decentralisation andpartial dismemberment of Germany.(b) Safeguarding of Russia&apos;s western frontiers in the Baltic area and elsewhere.Sir S. Cripps has warned us that it must be assumed that theSoviet Government have definite and concrete plans on this subject.If so, they may want us to approve their annexation of the baltic states and Eastern Poland, and to help them to secure special rightswith regard to Finland, the Dardanelles and access to the persian gulf, and an ice-free port in Northern Norway. It will be difficultat this stage to give the Soviet Government much satisfaction on these points, and presumably we shall have to decline for the present to go beyond the first and second clauses of the Atlantic Charter.5. Military, Memorandum. This should give as full data as possible of our resources in troops, &amp;c, how they are being used, the problems of transport and supply and, indeed, all the data necessary to give Stalin a clear and convincingpicture of our war effort or the limitations on the military assistance we can give,and should then show what we have available for use on the Russian southern front and the factors covering its use.6. Relation of United States Government to these discussions. There alsoarises the question of how much to say to the United States Government and when.This problem can most conveniently be considered under two heads:(a) information and (b) consultation.(a) Information.(i) Inform the United States Government at once of Stalin&apos;s pressingrequest to discuss war aims and post-war reconstruction and theproposal that I should visit Moscow to discuss these matters.(ii) Give them, in as much detail as possible, our plan for the line we proposeto take.(iii) The political memorandum and draft joint declaration prepared as thebasis of discussion with the Russians should be communicatedverbatim at the earliest possible moment for information, but not forconcurrence.(b) Consultation.The United States Government will have to be consulted as regards thefollowing in the fairly near future, but preferably not before our memorandum is communicated to the Soviet Government:  (i) The association of the Soviet Government in the negotiation of all inter-national commodity schemes in which they are likely to be interested,as well as in the studies of post-war reconstruction to be undertaken by the I.L.O.(ii) the extent to which the United States Government will be prepared todiscuss the peace settlement in advance with the Soviet Government.Lord Halifax&apos;s views will be necessary regarding the choice of opportunityat which the United States Government should be consulted.A. E.Foreign Office, November 29, 1941.[23195]
Annex I.DRAFT MEMORANDUM FOR COMMUNICATION TO THE SOVIETGOVERNMENT.His Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious for early consultation with the SovietGovernment in order to determine the best means of uniting their efforts for thewinning of the war and for devising and maintaining a durable peace.2. The conduct of the war must be the subject of a confidential exchangi ) Jof views, the result of which clearly cannot be given out to the world.3. Plans for the peace settlement, on which the views of the United StatesGovernment will, of course, be essential, should perhaps in great part remainknown only to the three Governments.4. But it seems highly desirable that the Soviet Government and HisMajesty&apos;s Government should forthwith mark their association in a public declaration in the same way as the United States Government and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have already, by the Atlantic Charter, together subscribed to certainguiding principles. Thus would be manifested the determination of the three great Powers to strive together for the utter defeat of totalitarian aggression,and for the restoration and maintenance of peace.5. Plainly, the first objective is the total defeat of Germany, and it issuggested that the two Governments might pledge themselves not to lay down their arms until the German military power has been so broken as to render itincapable of further threatening the peace of the world, and not to makepeace with any Government in Germany that does not clearly renounce allaggressive intentions.6. Secondly, as regards the after-war period, it will be desirable to plan to keep German)^ deprived of the military means of aggression against othercountries.7. As regards the Peace Settlement and the planning of post-war recon-struction, the Atlantic Charter, of which the Soviet Government have alreadyintimated their acceptance, might be taken as a starting-point.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government for their part would wish to associate themselves with the statement made by M. Stalin on the 6th November, when hedefined the war aims of the Soviet Government and their attitude towards othercountries.   M. Stalin&apos;s statement ran as follows : &quot; We have not, and we cannot have, such war aims as the seizure offoreign territory, the subjugation of foreign peoples, whether it concerns the peoples and territories of Europe, or the peoples and territories of Asia,including Persia. Our first aim consists in liberating our territories and ourpeoples from the German Fascist yoke.&apos;&apos; We have not, and we cannot have, such war aims as the forcing of ourwill and our regime upon the Slavonic or any other enslaved Europeanpeoples, who are expecting our assistance. Our aim consists in helping thesepeoples in their struggle for liberation against Hitlerite tyranny, and laterpermitting them freely to settle their own destiny in their own land. no interference in the internal affairs of other people.&quot;9. At this moment it will probably be found premature to attempt to reach any conclusions as regards the post-war territorial settlement, having regard to Jclause 2 of the Atlantic Charter, which deprecates any territorial changes thatdo not accord with the freely expressed wishes of the peoples concerned. On theother hand, His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise the need in any eventualsettlement to strengthen the smaller countries of Europe so as to put them, botheconomically and strategically, in a position to resist successfully pressure byGermany. For this purpose they welcome the negotiations between the Czecho-slovak and Polish Governments for a confederation. They would hope that thisfederal system might be extended so as to include other States of Central Europe.
It is understood, moreover, that this is the intention of the Polish andCzechoslovak Governments. His Majesty&apos;s Government also hope that the variousBalkan States may combine to form a similar system. Such confederations should contribute to the establishment of such a permanent system of general securityas is foreshadowed in the eighth clause of the Atlantic Charter.10. In the matter of economic reconstruction His Majesty&apos;s government hope that the Soviet Government will participate in the co-ordination of post-war economic policy generally, and His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that the SovietGovernment will be ready at the appropriate moment to participate in discussions on the various aspects of this far-reaching subject.11. His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise the justice of requiring Germanyto make restitution as far as is possible for the spoliation of which she has been guilty during the course of the war. This is a subject, however, which HisMajesty&apos;s Government would desire to examine and discuss further with theSoviet Government at a later stage when circumstances will make it easier thanat present to reach definite conclusions.12. His Majesty&apos;s Government will for their part be prepared to assist, inso far as lies in their power, in the economic rehabilitation of the Soviet Unionafter the war.13. On all of the above matters the association of the United StatesGovernment is essential and the Soviet Government will no doubt agree withHis Majesty&apos;s Government that, with this end in view, the United StatesGovernment should be kept fully informed of their discussions.14. It is, of course, recognised that there are many other questions affectingthe peace settlement which will have to be discussed between the British and soviet Governments in consultation with the other Allies and the United Stateswhen the elements of appreciation are sufficient to make it possible to reach conclusions.ANNEX II.Draft Declaration.THE [President of the Council of People&apos;s Commissars of the U.S.S.R.]and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Anthony Eden, representingHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, desire to make known certainprinciples on which they are agreed as regards the collaboration of theirrespective countries in the struggle against Hitlerite Germany and the restora-tion and maintenance of peace.1.   The bases of this collaboration are and will remain *(a) The Agreement between the two Governments signed at Moscow on the12th July, 1941.(b) The   fundamental   principles   of   the   declaration,   made   on   the14th August, 1941, by the President of the United States and thePrime Minister of the United Kingdom, with which the Governmentof the U.S.S.R. proclaimed its agreement, through the Ambassadorof the Union in London, at the Inter-Allied meeting held on the24th September, 1941.2. The two Governments hereby undertake to collaborate in every possible way until the German military power has been so broken as to render it incapable of further threatening the peace of the world, and not to make peace with any government of Germany that does not clearly renounce all aggressive intentions.3. The two Governments hereby declare their agreement to collaborate inthe peace settlement to be effected at the end of the present war, and also in themaintenance of peace and the planning and execution of post-war reconstruction.This must include the establishment and maintenance of conditions whichwill ensure that Germany is not again in a position to disturb the peace of theworld.
4. As regards the territorial questions to be dealt with in the peace settlement, the two countries will base their policy on the principle laid down inthe joint declaration of the President of the United States and the PrimeMinister of the United Kingdom that they &apos;&apos; seek no aggrandisement, territorialor other.&quot; At the same time His Majesty&apos;s Government associate themselves withthe following statement made by M. Stalin on the 6th November, 1941, whichhereby assumes the nature of a joint declaration : &quot; We have not, and we cannot have, such war aims as the seizure offoreign territory, the subjugation of foreign peoples, whether it concerns the peoples and territories of Europe, or the peoples and territories of Asia,including Persia. Our firm aim consists in liberating our territories andour peoples from the German Fascist yoke.&quot; We have not, and we cannot have, such war aims as the forcing of ourwill and our regime upon the Slavonic or any other enslaved Europeanpeoples, who are expecting our assistance. Our aim consists in helping thesepeoples in their struggle for liberation against Hitlerite tyranny, and laterpermitting them freely to settle their own destiny in their own land. no interference in the internal affairs of other people.&quot;5. The two Governments are convinced that the collaboration between themboth in war and peace provided for in the present Declaration will be of benefitnot only to their respective peoples but to the future of the world. It is theirearnest desire that all the countries now united in resistance to totalitarianaggression should participate in such collaboration.

For this purpose I propose to communicate to M. Stalin two memorandadealing with the political and military subjects for discussion on the following lines  3. Political Memorandum. We have to aim at exorcising certain suspicionsin Stalin&apos;s mind.  These appear to be (a) That we wish to exclude Russia from what we should like to be an anglo-American scheme for peace, and post-war settlement;(&amp;) That we should be prepared to make peace with a Germany controlled by the Army, if they were to overthrow the Party;(c) That in making peace we shall ignore Russian interests; and(d) That we are not really ready at the peace settlement to take sufficientlydrastic measures against Germany to render her harmless for manyyears to come.4. I propose, therefore, that the political memorandum should cover thefollowing subjects : (a) Joint declaration of policy.In order to meet the four grounds of suspicion referred to in the preceding paragraph, we should invite the Soviet Government to agree in general terms ina joint declaration reaffirming the intention of the two countries to continue thewar until the defeat of Germany, and declaring mutual agreement to collaboratenot only in the peace settlement, but also in maintaining that settlement and inthe planning of post-war reconstruction.
