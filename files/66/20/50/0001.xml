(42) 19. \JJanuary 10, 1942.WAR CABINET.OFFICES OR PLACES OF PROFIT UNDER THE CROWN.Report by the Minister without Portfolio.AT their meeting on Thursday, the 20th November, 1941 (W.M. (41)116th Meeting, Conclusion 4), the War Cabinet considered the procedure necessaryfor dealing with the Report from the Select Committee on Offices or Places of profit under the Crown, and appointed a committee comprising The Minister without Portfolio,The Chancellor of the Exchequer, andThe Secretary, Department of Overseas Trade,with the following terms of reference : (a) To consider the recommendations in the Select Committee&apos;s Report fordealing with the position of offices or places of profit under the Crownduring the continuance of the present war, and to make proposals for amending legislation.(b) To consider and report on the proposals for normal peace-time legisla-tion contained in the Report of the Select Committee.&quot;2. The Committee have held two meetings, at each of which they have hadthe assistance of the Attorney-General and the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury. They have now completed that part of their work which arises from paragraph (a) of their terms of reference and have requested me to make an interim report to the War Cabinet embodying the conclusions which tso far reached.The Discussion in the House of Commons on the Select Committee&apos;s Report.3. The Select Committee&apos;s recommendations and suggestions for dealingwith the position of offices or places of profit under the Crown during theemergency period resulting from the war are contained in Part II of the SelectCommittee&apos;s Report. In considering these recommendations and suggestions wehave naturally taken account of the fact that the House of Commons will expectan early discussion of the Select Committee&apos;s Report as a whole. In thisconnection our conclusions are as follows :  (i) That it would be desirable for an early discussion to be held in theHouse on the Report of the Select Committee as a whole,(ii) That the discussion should take place on a motion to be moved by thechairman of the Select Committee or a member thereof. The questionof the form of motion is now under discussion,(iii) That in the course of the discussion the Government should definetheir attitude towards the recommendations and suggestions made inPart IT of the Select Committee&apos;s Report.[23332] b
(iv) That in the course of the discussion the Government should promise toconsider the introduction, when convenient, of legislation for amending and clarifying the permanent law on the subject ofdisqualification for membership of the House of Commons in the lightof the views expressed in the discussion. We do not think that theGovernment should make any definite pledge to introduce legislation on this subject during the war.Part II of the Select Commtttee&apos;s Report.4. I have now to state our conclusions on the recommendations and sugges-tions contained in Part II of the Select Committee&apos;s Report. The action whichwill be necessary if our recommendations are accepted is summarised inparagraph 9 below.5. The House of Commons Disqualification (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1941.This Act is dealt with in paragraph 87 of the Committee&apos;s Report. it provides that, if the First Lord of the Treasury certifies that the appointmentof a person being a Member of the House&apos; of Commons to an office or place underthe Crown is required in the public interest for purposes connected with the prosecution of any war in which His Majesty may be engaged, the person towhom the certificate is issued shall be free.&quot; during the present war period, fromany disqualification for membership of the House of Commons which would otherwise have attached to his tenure of the office or place in question. Copiesof certificates under the Act are required to be laid before the House. Fourteencertificates have already been issued. A list of the holders and their offices isgiven in the Appendix hereto. Unless continued, the Act will expire on the6th March. 1942. with a saving for certificates previously issued.On this Act, the recommendations and suggestions of the Select Committee &apos;are as follows :  -(i) That, if the Act is continued in force after the date limited for itsexpiry, provision should be made whereby the Act again expires atthe end of another twelve months unless again renewed (with or without amendment) for another period not exceeding-twelve months,(ii) That a certificate issued under the Act to a Member might be requiredto state, not only that the appointment of the Member.to the office or place in question is required in the public interest for purposesconnected with the prosecution of the war, but also that it is in thepublic interest that the Member should retain his seat.(iii) That provision might be made for  the formal communication of certificates under the Act to Mr. Speaker, who would inform theHouse thereof from the Chair.(iv) That a reasonably wide limit might be placed on the number of certi-certificates permitted to be given during the year the Act is to be in force,and that provision might be made enabling the permitted numberof certificates to be increased by an Order in Council on an addressby the House.(v) That consideration might be given to limiting the exemption fromdisqualification to some stated period of time unless extended in anyparticular case by an Order in Council on an address by the House, orby a resolution of the House.Our conclusions upon these suggestions and recommendations are asfollows :  (i) That the Act should be continued in force for a further period of twelve months beginning on the 6th March, 1942, and should thenexpire, unless again renewed (with or without amendments) for another period not exceeding twelve months.(ii) That this suggestion should be rejected.   It seemed to us that it would put a very great burden on the First Lord of the Treasury if he were required to express an opinion on the question whether &quot;it is in thepublic interest that a Member should retain his seat. The PrimeMinister has expressed his agreement with this conclusion.
(in) That it would be desirable to give effect to this suggestion if mr. Speaker&apos;s concurrence could be obtained, but not otherwise. Wesought the guidance of Mr. Speaker, who is of opinion that the course proposed would be of little value as a means of giving publicity to thecertificates, and that it should not be adopted. We think thatMr. Speakers view should prevail upon this point. Mr. Speakersuggested, however, that arrangements should be made for the certi-certificates to be printed in Hansard. We think this a valuable suggestion,and we recommend that effect should be given to it.(iv) That the Act should be amended so that the number of certificates whichmay be in force at any one time should not exceed twenty-five, subjectto a power to increase this number by Order in Council on an addressby the House of Commons.(v) That this suggestion should be rejected.   It would be impossible to limit the period of validity of certificates without providing for anextension. But if the extension were to be by Order in Council on an address by the House of Commons, or by a resolution of the House, itmight have the effect of promoting a gratuitous debate upon the actions of a public servant at a time when&apos; such a debate was highly understandable.6. The Ministers of the Crown (Emergency Appointments) Act, 1939.Section 1 (2) of this Act provides that any Minister to whom the Act appliesshall not be disqualified, by reason of his office, for membership of the House. TheParliamentary Secretary to his department is similarly protected. The Act maybe applied by Order in Council to any Minister appointed for the purpose of exercising functions connected with the prosecution of any war in which HisMajesty may be engaged. The Act has already been applied to several Ministersappointed for war purposes (e.g., the Minister of Economic Warfare). There isno provision in the Act for limiting its duration.The Select Committee recommend (paragraph 83) that the Act should be amended by the addition of a definite provision for its expiring not later thanthe present emergency.We recommend that the Act should be amended by the addition of a provisionfor its expiry on the termination of the present emergency. The date of thetermination of the emergency would, in this case, as in other cases, be fixed byOrder in Council.7. Duration of Emergency Legislation.The Select Committee considered generally the duration of all those provisions relating to disqualification for membership of the House of Commonswhich are limited to expire with the present emergency. They recommend (para-graph 81) &quot; that the necessary steps should be taken to bring those provisions toan end at the earliest time reasonably possible, rather than that they should beleft in force until the official or technical termination of the present emergency.&apos;1Our conclusions on this recommendation are : (i) That it might not prove practicable to arrange for the simultaneoustermination of all those provisions relating to disqualification for membership of the House of Commons which are limited to expirewith the present emergency.(ii) That while it would be desirable to fix the earliest possible date for thetermination of each of the provisions in question, it would not bepossible to decide what date or dates would be appropriate, except inthe light of circumstances existing at the end of the war.(iii) That while no undertaking could be given as to the date on which anyof the provisions in question would be terminated, the Governmentshould make it clear to the House that they share the view of theSelect Committee that every such provision should be terminated assoon as is reasonably practicable.[23332] b 2
8. Position of Members holding Offices or Places such as would in normal Timesdisqualify them for Membership.Paragraph 86 of the Report contains the following recommendations: &quot; That a member of the House temporarily in the service of the Crownin connection with the prosecution of the present war should be entitled to claim and receive the same protection against attack or criticism in theHouse in respect of his duties in that service as is customarily given to civilservants, so long as he refrains from inviting such attack or criticism byspeech or action connected with such service That such Members should bear in mind the peculiar responsibility resting upon them through theirtemporarily holding positions which in normal umes would disqualify themfor membership of the House, and that, while the House does not impose upon them any restrictions of the liberty enjoyed by members of the Housegenerally, they should refrain from addressing the House or voting orotherwise taking part in proceedings connected with their service underthe Crown, unless convinced that their doing so will receive the general assent of the House or is urgently necessary in the national interest.&quot;In sub-paragraph 4 of paragraph 88 of their Report the Select committee recommend : &quot;That the attention of all members of the House of Commons be specially drawn to paragraph 86 of this Report relating to restriction on and protection of Members holding offices or places such as would in mormal times disqualify them from membership.&quot;We recommend : (i) That the Government should indicate to the House that they approve ofthe principles laid clown in paragraph 86 of the Report from theSelect Committee.(ii) That  the  Government  should  make  special  arrangements  to  haveparagraph 86 of the Report brought to the attention of every member to whom a certificate is issued under the House of commons disqualification (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1941, and should informthe House of these arrangements. Where the Member is attached toa particular government department, the most convenient arrange-ment would probably be for the Minister in charge of that departmentto be charged with the duty of drawing the Member&apos;s attention tothe paragraph.9. If our recommendations are accepted, the following action will benecessary :  (i) A Bill should be introduced and passed into law before the 6th March,1942, making provision whereby : (a) The House of Commons Disqualification (Temporary Provisions)Act, 1941. is continued in force for a further vear beginningon the 6th March, 1942.(6) The number of certificates under the Act which may be in force at any one time is not to exceed twenty-five, subject to a powerto increase this number by Order in Council on an address bythe House of Commons.(c) The Ministers of the Crown (Emergency Appointments) Act, 1939,is limited to expire upon such date as His Majesty may byOrder in Council declare to be the date on which the emergencywhich was the occasion of the passing of that Act came toan end.(ii) Arrangements should be made for the printing in Hansard of certificatesissued under the House of&quot; Commons Disqualification (temporary provisions) Act, 1941.(iii) The Government should indicate, in the course of the discussion in theHouse of Commons on the Report of the Select Committee, that, while no undertaking can be given as to the date on which any of the
emergency provisions relating to disqualification can be terminated,they share the view of the Select Committee that each of the provisions in question should be terminated as soon as is reasonably practicable,(iv) In the course of the discussion the Government should further indicatethat they approve of the principles laid down in paragraph 86 of theReport as to the position and conduct of Members holding offices orplaces such as would in normal times disqualify them for membership,(v) The Government should make arrangements to have paragraph 86 ofthe Report brought to the attention of every Member to whom acertificate is issued under the House of Commons Disqualification(Temporary Provisions) Act, 1941, and should inform the House ofthese arrangements. Where the Member is attached to a particular department, it should be the duty of the Minister in charge of that department to draw the Member&apos;s attention to paragraph 86 of theReport. In other cases the necessary action might be taken by thePrime Minister.(Initialled) A.
