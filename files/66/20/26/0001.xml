(THIS DOCUMENT ISJTHE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIO MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT. )TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY, &apos;it is requested tnat spei ial cvi-e may betaken ta 2 J 3tnsure the secrecy of this document.MOST secret.P.(41) 305.----- ^19TH DECEMBER,  1941. - COPY NO. war CABINETALLIED CQt-ORDIIIATIONDraft telegram to H.M. Ambassador, Washington,prepared at an interdepartmental meeting.1.      There are several indications that President islikely to raise with you the question of machinery for allied co-ordination.      This matter is receiving much attention inParliament and press here and the need for some governmentalstatement may arise at short notice,      I therefore send you the provisional views of War Cabinet,2&quot;      Higher Direction of Allied Y/ar Effort.,Speed of developments in this war and widespreadnature of conflict would make it, in practice, extremelydifficult to secure the effective ox^eration of anything inthe nature of a Supreme War Council embracing all the Allies.No doubt some of the difficulties would be overcome ifmembership were confined to the principal powers.      But thiswould lead to great difficulties with the Dominions, whowould be bound to press for representation,and probably also with the smaller Allies,      We suggest therefore that everyeffort should be made to avoid the formal establishment atthis stage of a Supreme War Council.      Occasional conferenceson which all the Allies and the Dominions are represented willbe necessary and useful.      But it seems clear that decisions on individual questions of importance must be taken as a resultof direct consultation between executive heads of ^Q countriesimmediately and vitally interested.      Such consultations would no doubt sometimes take the form of ad hoc meetings, held atthe most-convenient place in each case. ;-1-

3o      Military Co-ordinatloin^It is not the purpose of the telegram to deal withthis aspect, which we know is very much in your thoughts.We would only say that arguments in paragraph 2 above seemto apply equally to any proposal for establishment ofpermanent organisation on the lines of the Allied military committee of 1939-1940, and that better solution may lie in development and extension of present system of MilitaryLiaison Missions and occasional meetings between the Chiefsof Staff as required,  as well as an extended application of system to areas of strategic responsibility worked out inA.B.C.1.      Under this system day to day consultation on theconduct of the war in any one area takes place in capital of country responsible.      (With the extension of the war tothe Far East, Singapore may perhaps be regarded as a capital for this purpose).4.      Utilisation of Allied Resources.Here again we feel that it would be best to avoid,at any rate at first, establishment of any formal allied co-ordinating body or bodies, and to proceed by way of thedevelopment and adaptation, not necessarily on preciselysimilar lines, of existing liaison missions and Committeesand their extension to cover other subjects,  as and when necessary.      Similarly, we think it would be unwise at this&apos;stage to take any final decision on country to be regarded ascentral point for&quot; consultations on whole or part of this field.But in case discussions on this point become inevitable, we wish to bring following considerations to your notice.5.     A number of bipartite Committees with Representativesof this country on the one hand and of various Allies (not including the United States) already sit in London and control the allocation and use of shipping of the Governmentsconcerned.      The existence of these arrangements, which worksmoothly and successfully;    our close relationship with

1*1continental maritime countries and their ship owners, and theexperience we have gained during the last two years, all makeit very desirable to maintain this machinery on this side ofthe Atlantic.      In this connexion it must be remembered thatseat of Government of the smaller Allies, many of whose maincontributions to the common war effort is in shipping, is inLondon.      Moreover, the shipping problems which arise fromthe varied and complicated programmes of imports, both militaryand civil, for the Middle East, Persian Gulf, and thiscountry, as well as the shipping obligations imposed upon us by current and immediately prospective military operations,cannot be adequately resolved elsewhere than in London, wherethe programmes are constructed.      This consideration appliesequally to the planning of leading programmes and to the day to day adjustments which have to he made,      Any change,especially in the near future, must lead to grave disturbancesand most adversely affect the -plans for current operations,6a      In fields of raw materials,  food and oil, theneeds of this country and of the other areas for which theUnited Kingdom Government are responsible, are so extensiveand so complicated that it is inevitable in present circumstances that the supply programmes should be constructed in London.Moreover, though consultations on these supply questionsmust continue to take place both in Washington and in London,the question of shipping priority is fundamental to them,and can only be decided at the centre from which the shipping to carry them is controlled,,7.      On the other hand the co-ordination of production programmes and of the allocation of war-like stores may well,have to be centred in due course at Washington,      It raisesvast problems concerned with the utilisation of the industrial capacity of the prorinr.i no- countries.      It is also closely connected with the whole strategical picture.  since thosewho assume responsibility for planning production and

allocating deliveries,  in effect become responsible forseeing that the equipment required to carry out strategicalplans is delivered at the right time to the various areas of strategic responsi&quot;bi 1 ity.      It is likely to be some time beforethe U.Sr  administrative machine can bo adapted to dealadequately with these vital matters.       We consider therefore that it would be a mistake to disturb at once the organisation which we have developed to handle them,,      The movement of thecentre of gravity on these matters across the Atlantic is nodoubt inevitable but it should be gradual,,8.      Whilst considering that arrangements for allied co-ordination in these fields can be allowed to developgradually, we would welcome measures to strengthen ourliaison with the U.S., such as the appointment in the immediatefuture to London of representatives authorised to enter intodefinite engagements on behalf of the competent U.S.  agencieson such questions as shipping,  food,  raw materials,  oil,  andon questions of export policy,  such as the supply of manufacturedgoods (including essential civilian needs) required tomaintain the war effort of the Empire and of the smaller Allies,If such representatives were appointed, we should be only tooglad to take them to the very fullest degree into our confidence.      For instance, American representatives alreadyattend the meetings of the Tanker Development Committee, and aproposal that the U.So  should have a representative at meetingsof the Oil Control Board has already been put forward , We alsothink it would be of great, assistance if, now that U.S.  have entered the war, there were closer co-ordination than in thepast,both between the representatives of the various U.S.agencies in this country,and also between our various missions and representatives in Washington.      We feel that the highest possible degree of directive responsibility should boconcentrated at the apex of these two organisations,and that each should be served by the administrative machinery necessary&quot;to secure adequate co-ordination0-4-

9.      Communications -Whatever the arrangements made, the pressure ontransatlantic communications, already causing serious delays,will be intensified.      Perhaps the most valuable contribution towards better A iglo-American co-ordination would be animprovement in air communications*      This cannot be achievedunless the U.S.  can provide aircraft with the necessaryrange and carrying capacityc
