Printed for the War Cabinet.   January 1942.SECRET. Copy No.   31W.P. (42) 6.January 3, 1942.WAR CABINET. i-      VGREECE :  THE BLOCKADE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.A SERIOUS situation has arisen in Greece. The large number of reports which have been received leave no doubt that starvation conditions already exist in that country, and according to one account as many as 2,000 people are dying-daily in Athens alone.2. The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government is based on the fact that thelegal responsibility for the occupied countries of Europe rests upon the occupying powers. In actual practice the industrial and other benefits which the germans are obtaining in Norway, Holland, Belgium, &amp;c, have led them to make certain minimum provision for feeding these countries. In the case of Greece, however,the Germans derive little benefit from their occupation apart from their use ofthe country as a military base. Moreover, the transport of supplies has been rendered extremely difficult by the total disorganisation of Balkan land cornmuni-cations culminating in the Yugoslav rising.3. Although, therefore, the Germans have enough wheat available in central Europe to relieve Greek distress, they have no incentive to transport itto Greece, and the difficulty of doing so is considerable. The Italians are power-less in the matter, and it has thus come about that the situation originallyproduced by the depredations of the German invaders has got very largely outof hand. Reports on Greek morale have hitherto suggested that it is still high,but it would be foolish to imagine that a death rate on the present scale can persistwithout German propaganda having its effect. The Greeks will no doubt continueto hate the Germans, but they will hate His Majesty&apos;s Government as well. Thiswould cause us very great embarrassment both in the event of future militaryoperations in Greece and (certainly) after the war. Even now it is far fromimpossible that the Greek Government will resign, which would create a most damaging situation.4. There is the further consideration that the Turkish Government, seeing the plight to which Greece has been reduced through her gallant resistance tothe German and Italian invasion, may not be strengthened in her resolve to defendher own territory against a possible German aggression.5.   We are in any case already experiencing acute political difficulties :- -(a) The Greek Prime Minister has felt compelled to telegraph an urgentappeal to President Roosevelt and to write a very strong letter to thePrime Minister.(b) The Minister of State at Cairo, who himself urges the despatch of wheat to Greece from Egypt, telegraphs that he is besieged by the local Greekleaders, and fears he cannot hold the position much longer.(c) The United States Government have urged us, through Mr. Winant, toconsider the despatch of wheat to Greece via Turkey.11596   [23306]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT -
6. It is the United States intervention which I consider the most serious.Although they have hitherto supported the principle of the blockade and nowexpressly disclaim any wish to dictate to us, I fear we cannot expect to maintainthe blockade in opposition to the known views of the United States, and thoseviews will certainly become known as the crisis develops. It is, indeed, only theUnited States Administration^ support which has prevented United Statespublic opinion from getting out of hand before. I consider, therefore, thatwe must (1) Enlist the full co-operation and support of the United States Governmentfor our blockade policy as soon as possible; and(2) Take such immediate measures as will hold the Greek situation and makeit possible for the United States Government to confirm their public support for the principle of our blockade.7. We are already sponsoring (a) a limited scheme of purchases in Turkey(insitie the blockade), (6) a child emigration scheme (still on paper only), (c) aproposal to allow free and safe passage to Axis vessels carrying food to Greece.These are small-scale efforts and will not reduce the death rate. I can thereforesee no alternative to the Minister of State&apos;s proposal, which involves connivingat exports of wheat from Turkey to be replaced by ourselves. I realise thedifficulty of preserving secrecy and the likelihood of complications with our other allies, but I must ask my colleagues to take into consideration the fact that, ifwe do nothing, we shall almost certainly have to make much wider concessions in the end under pressure from the United States. As regards opinion in thiscountry, I think it likely that we shall be under pressure here, too, as soon asthe facts of the situation become known and the public discovers that our policyis even partially responsible for starving the most gallant of our Allies. I havealready had a strong letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury on the subject.8. I would accordingly propose that my Department should be authorisedto concert with the Ministry of Economic Warfare as to the best method of promoting shipments of wheat from Turkey to Greece on the general under-standing that His Majesty&apos;s Government have no connexion with such shipmentsand are involved only to the extent of a private undertaking to the TurkishGovernment to replace the grain so shipped.A.
