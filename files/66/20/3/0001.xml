TO BE KEPT UNDER LOOK AND KEY, /It is t^u&amp;ated that special care may be taken to it        14Sftsyy^ Xm saarecy of this document,-nnniTMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)T    S E C R E T.. W.P. (41) 831. COPY NO. ,   ^tf22ND NOVEMBER,  194.1.WAR CABINET.UNITED STATES BASES:    DEFENCE QUESTIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I have seen the Memorandum hy the Chiefs of StaffComrnittee, W. p. (41) 277, with regard to the proposed agreement on Defence problems in those Colonies in which bases have beenleased to the United States.2. As is stated in paragraph 4 of the Memorandum,Newfoundland,  in which also there are leased bases, wasexpressly excluded from the negotiations and the Agreement, butit is clear that questions similar to those dealt with in theAgreement will also arise in Newfoundland and it is likely thatthe Agreement,  if approved in the case of Colonies, will beregarded to a considerable extent as a precedent for Newfoundland.3. The proposed Agreement is in consequence a matter ofconsiderable interest to Canada, which has assumed certainresponsibilities for the defence of Newfoundland during the warand has sent troops to the Island.      Moreover,  it has been agreed by the Joint United States - Canada Defence Board thatNewfoundland, as the gateway to Canada, falls within theCanadian sphere of defence.      The question which will particularlyinterest Canada is    therefore, who will command&apos; in the event of combined operations by British and United States forces.4. Articles 20 and 21 of the proposed Agreement regardingthe Colonies provide that the nationality of the officer toassume command of the combined local defence forces is to bedetermined by the general considerations of the strengths of theforces involved, combined with the tactical or strategicalimportance of the locality to each of the countries concerned,and that initially the commander of the combined forces will bean officer of the United States armed forces.      In the case of new foundland, however, the Canadian Government are contemplatingthat, if any question of command arose, the commander should bea Canadian officer.      This would also be important from our point of view having regard to   the constitutional position of new foundland and the question of its future status.      If theAgreement regarding Colonies were applied to Newfoundland,  theposition at the moment is that a Canadian commander would presumably be appointed,  since, for the present,  the canadian troops in Newfoundland outnumber United States troops there.

It is, however^ open to the United States to increase thenumber of their troops in the Is,land,  and in fact it &quot;is their intention,- if the necessity were to arise, to increase their forces to the strength of a division.      Moreover,  they haverecently appointed a Major-General to command the United states troops in Newfoundland, whereas  the present Canadian commanderis only a Brigadier,.      It seems likely, therefore, that theywould make every endeavour to ensure -chat the commander shouldbe a United States officer if the necessity for jointoperations arose35. Mre Mackenzie-King, when he was in this country, made itclear to me in conversation that he felt strongly that a canadian officer should be appointed if any question of jointcommand arose, and that he would propose,  if necessary,  totake up the matter personally with President Roosevelt.6. Canada is also interest-ed in the proposed Agreement in another way, since there is at present a Canadian battalionat Jamaica which, under the proposed arrangements, will come under the command of a United States off ice jr..7.        In the circumstances, I strongly support the recommendationof the Chiefs of Star; . in paragraph 5 or their memorandum that the Canadian Government should be made aware as soon aspossible of the position0      I suggest also that we should leave Mr. Mackenzie King in no doubt  that were like himself,think it essential to secure,  if possible, that the command in Newfoundland should devolve upon a Canadian officers(Intldo) CrDominions Office, SoWo2 2nd november e r, 1941a
