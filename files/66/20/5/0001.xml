TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. 22It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.THIS D0CU1IENT IS THE IROFERTY OF his miTAFNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVBRIMiKT.j *J^ &quot;     &quot;&quot; copy no.p2.2..*.p.(41) 283.22 NOV1947 india; keeease of satyagraka prisoi-sers.Ileiaoranduiii by the Secretary of State for India.^i&quot; In my telegram of the 21st November, No. 14944 (sent in pursuance-, ofWar Cabinet Conclusions 116(41) dated 20th November&quot;, 1941) the Governor-General was instructed to refer back if he felt that a public amiouncementof the decision to release Satyagraha prisoners ;?as necessary, or if he felt that the semi-official for::.:., of instructions from the Central Governmentto the Provincial Governments re contended in that telegram -was lessappropriate than official action.    His telegram of 22nd November, No.2948SI .    (attached as Annex A) shows that he still finds it essential that anI I    announcement of cordon policy, to be followed by all Governments in India,I       should be i?iaa!e&quot;as&quot;^b&quot;on&quot;&quot;&apos;as possible by the Government of India.I would urge the view that His Majesty&apos;s Government should no longerhold out against this earnestly expressed desire of the Governor-general for an announcement without which his Government might, in thecircumstances, be exposed to a serious loss of prestige.    Thevalue     of   the proposed act of clemency  is expected to be animprovement in the war effort which, in its all-India aspect, is a matterof concern for the Central Government rather than the Provincial Governments.As regards the form of the instructions to the Provincial GovernmentsI think that there is no gainsaying the objections to blurring in any waythe responsibilities of the Government of India, in this ratter; but I should wish to suggest that though it is very desirable that the instructions issued by the Central Government to Provincial Governments should, intheir form, strictly comply with requirements of the Statute, there isno need in a public announcement about the matter to rub in too pointedlyany features of these instructions which right provoke undesirablecontroversy or speculation in the minds of a public not fully instructedin the intricacies of the legal problem.In these circumstances I append:-(a) As Annex B.    A draft reply to the Governor-General&apos;s telegram.2948S.(b) As Annex C.    A suggested draft, slightly varied from theoriginal draft by the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Committee (W.P. (41) 275),of anannouncement by the Government of India.IL. s. A.INDIA OPPECE,22nd November, 1941.

ANNEX A.19654-telegram from Governor.-General to Secretary of Statefor India.SECRET.Dated New Delhi 18.00 hours, 22nd November, 1941.XXXIMMEDIATE.2948. S.Your personal telegram 14944 of November 21st.    Satyagraha prisoners.I consider it essential that an announcement of conoon policy to &quot;befollowed by all Governments in India should be made as soon as possible by Government of India.    The natter lias aroused great public interestand we already stated in the Assembly, following the wording of yourpersonal telegram 14733 of November 17th, that this Government wouldgive careful consideration to question without unnecessary delay and ina sjrnpathetic spirit.    If after this impression Is created that thematter has been left to the Provinces the idea Will gain ground thatwe have been overruled in some respect and prestige of my Government willbe greatly affected.   Action should therefore clearly take the formof an official instruction from Government of India to provincial governments accompanied by a parallel personal communication from myselfto Governors explaining that H.H.G. have accepted policy.    This coursewould seem to be more in accordance with principle mentioned inparagraph No.l of your telegram that Government of India should take theresponsibility for a policy which is actually theirs and I see no good reason for, and indeed every objection to, attempting to obscure this responsibility in the manner suggested in your paragraph No. 3*    In viewhowever of different points of view urged in these two paragraphs thefact that use of Section 126 A is to receive further consideration,I still think that word &quot;advise&quot; used in our original draft announcement would best meet the needs of the case.    This would not obscure the factthat responsibility was that of Central Government, while at the same time it would not commit us to any particular view of the appropriateness of using Section 126A in a matter of this kind and would sufficiently saveresponsibility of the Provinces in regard to local working out of scheme.2.   As regards Nehru, our proposal was that his release should besimultaneous with that of other prisoners (including Abul Kalam Azad) andit does not appear that Hallett attached particular importance to keepinghim in jail for some time longer if policy of release of other prisonersis to be pursued at all.    If his sentences were to be made concurrent Iunderstand that with ordinary remissions he would be due for release aboutthe end of December.   My Council was clearly of opinion that proposed policy would lose most of its intended effect if Nehru&apos;s release were held up.I therefore strongly favour release with Satyagrahis, and this must Ithink form an integral part of contemplated amiouncenent.

ANNEX B.DRAFT TELEGRAM.From Secretary of State for India to governor-General.MOST  MEDIATE.My telegram 21st November, 14-944.   Satyagraha prisoners.Cabinet have now considered this matter further and in the light ofyour reply to paragraph 4 of my telegram -withdraw their objections to public announcement by your Government.    They agree also thatrequisite communication from Government of India to provincial governments should be of nature more closely conforming -with provisions of Section 126A than that recommended in paragraph 3 of my telegram.2.    It is important, however, to- distinguish between the form which action by the Central Government should properly take and the emphasis which it is necessary to lay on the form of that action ina public -announcement.    His Majesty&apos;s Government maintain their objections to the use of the word &quot;advise&quot;, since this is a functionno-where conferred on the Central Government vis-a-vis provincial governments.    They consider therefore that the action of your government should take the form of official confidential directionsresting on the authority of Section 126A and that the amouncementmight be in some such form as that in my immsdiately following telegram, which you will see corresponds to that originally proposedby you as amended by your telegram of 17th November, 6467, with the modification that the sense of the additional paragraph thereproposed is brought up into the introductory paragraph.    In the viewof His Majesty1 s Government the first sentence of the second paragraphof this draft announcement indicates sufficiently clearly that thedecisionis that of the Central Government.3.   His Majesty&apos;s Government are content to leave it to you to decide, in consuHtation with the Governor of the United Provinces,in what manner to dispose of Nehru&apos;s case and the terms of theannouncement in regard to him and Kalam Azad.

ANNEX C.Revised draft Announcgmerrb.The Government of India have no intention of relaxing the measureswhich they have already taken and which they will continue to take againstactivities or propaganda calculated to inpede the war effort or topromote mass disorder.    On the other hand they are animated hy a sinceredesire to secure the greatest measure of public support and unity in meeting the threat to India1s security created by the war.   For thisreason they are anxious that no person should be kept in jail inconnection with the Civil Disobedience campaign, whose detention is not necessary in the interests of the prosecution of the war; and they considerthat no necessity now remains to hold in custody persons who have been convicted or detained either for participating in.the Civil disobedience movement or for having given notice of their intention to do so.   within this category they include not only persons who merely recited prescribedslogans but also those who accompanied such recital with a speech not materially adding to it3 substance.The Government of India have communicated their conclusion to allProvincial Governments and the Governments of the Chief Commissioners&apos;Provinces who will accordingly release all prisoners who fall within the categories described above as soon as the varying administrativerequirements of the respective Provinces permit.   The Local Governments will exercise their discretion in determining the order in which individualprisoners shall be released, the period over which the process of releaseshould be spread and the measures required to ensure that public order isnot prejudiced; in the United Provinces where the number of such prisonersis far larger than elsewhere the process will inevitably take longer thanin other Provinces.
