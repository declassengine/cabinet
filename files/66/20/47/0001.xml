A. FREE FRENCH.(i) Navy.Ships recently Commissioned and to Commission shortly.The Free French have manned five Tugs in the Suez Canal area. the eighth Corvette which it had been hoped to commission before the end of the year&apos;s  now due to complete in January.It is under consideration to allocate^ further four M.L.&apos;s to the French. Ifagreed, this will constitute a flotilla of eight.The Triomphant, Chevreuil and Cap des Palmes are remaining in the Pacificunder the orders of Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet.The Submarine Surcouf is under orders to proceed to the Pacific in the nearfuture.2. Training.During the last quarter another hundred men have passed throughH.M,S. Royal Arthur and one hundred are still there.Seven cadets have completed their six months at Dartmouth. Their reports are very satisfactory.   A further six will join in January.3. Recruiting.The number of recruits from Vichy ships at Alexandria is small, but the totalnumber received from all sources during the quarter may be considered satisfac-tory, viz., thirty officers and 670 men.4. Her Majesty The Queen paid a visit to the Convalescent Home atBeaconsfield and was received by General de Gaulle and Admiral Muselier. Asmall hospital has been started for the F.N.F.L. in a house which was placed attheir disposal in Regent&apos;s Park.5. General de Gaulle, accompanied by Admiral Muselier, paid visits to french ships at Dundee and Portsmouth. The General also inspected free french ratings who were under training in H.M.S. Excellent.6. Depot.The existing Depot at Portsmouth, which consists of the Ouragon, A miensand Arras, is no longer sufficient for requirements. The question of providing a camp near Portsmouth sufficient to accommodate 300 to 400 men is underconsideration.The reception depot, which was formerly at Ranelagh, has been removed toClapham Common.7. Mercantile Marine.Admiral Muselier has been nominated Commissioner for the Free FrenchMercantile Marine and negotiations to determine respective functions of himself and the Ministry of War Transport are still in progress. About forty merchant ships are now manned by Free French crews.8. Admiral Muselier sailed in the Lobelia on the 24th November to inspectthe Free French corvettes based at Newfoundland. He also visited Iceland andNova Scotia. Subsequently the Admiral, flying his flag in the Mimosa with theAlysse, Aconit and Surcouf in company, visited St. Pierre and Miquelon andrallied the inhabitants to de Gaulle.9. Censorship of Mail.Letters written by the Free French personnel continue to show a high morale and a spirit of optimism.10. Frenchmen in the Royal Navy.All Frenchmen in the Royal Navy are now attached to the PortsmouthDivision. A few transfers to the F.N.F.L. have been effected and there remain25 officers and 380 men, as against 33 officers and 550 men at the beginning ofthe year,

Employment.At the beginning of October a draft qf 41 all ranks (including 26 officers)left for Syria, and in December a second draft, consisting of 2 officers and45 other ranks, left for the Middle East.In October the Camp absorbed the military section of the Raneiagh Depot,which is now only maintained for naval personnel. The O.C. Depot at Raneiagh,(Commandant Bruyeres) formally took over command of the whole camp atCamberley.As yet, very little of the training equipment requisitioned on the31st October has been supplied, consequently training is somewhat curtailed.However, the Training Group of units has been organised as if the equipment-were available, and instruction is carried out in all arms on a small scale. Thetraining scheme concerns about 30 officers and 360 other ranks, formed into thefollowing units : Mixed Squadron 2 M/C units.1 Tracked Vehicle unit.Artillery 1 class for 40-mm. Bofors A.A. gun.1 class for 75-mm. Field Gun.Signals 1 unit.Infantry 3 Rifle Platoons.1 Marine Section.An air co-operation exercise was carried out with No. 400 Squadron inOctober, and signals training with aircraft continues to be carried out with the help of neighbouring R.A.F. Squadrons. Weapon training continues normally,and an improvement has been noted in the standard of shooting : Lewis guns inparticular are well handled. An experimental anti-gas exercise was held inco-operation with the British R.E. unit stationed in the same camp, and a successful P.A.D. exercise was held under the supervision of the Sub-AreaP.A.D. Officer. P.A.D. is now being given proper attention and a French officerhas been appointed as Camp P.A.D. Officer after attending a course at a P.A.D.School. .Instructional courses with British Schools and Training Units continue.A party of A.A. gunners attended a British Practice camp for firing instruction.Four French artillery officers were taken to Larkhill to see a demonstration of25-pdrs. in A/Tank and normal roles.   At this demonstration 2-pdr. and 75-mm.- guns were also fired at moving tank targets.On the 14th November General de Gaulle paid a visit to the Camp. Theceremonial parade was the occasion for bestowing decorations on all the 186Frenchmen escaped from Germany via Russia, as well as on a number of other officers and men of all three services. In December General Legentiihomme ,(National Commissioner for War) visited the Camp and gave the officers alecture on the campaign in Syria. . &quot;&quot; 114. Security. &apos; .Realising the need for greater security precautions at Camberley, the hewCO. applied for a Free French Security Officer to be attached to the Camp.
This officer, who works under the orders of the Free French Security Officer-inLondon, has now established personal contact with the local British SecurityOfficer at Camberley.15. Welfare.Satisfactory.   A&apos; new Welfare Officer (Chaplain) has been appointed at the camp.16. Morale.Morale continues good.(iii) Air Force.17. Expansion of the Free French Air Force Order of Battle.Since the last quarterly report No. 340 Free French Fighter Squadron hasbeen formed for service in Fighter Command. The Squadron, which is equipped with Spitfires, is the first Free French Squadron to form in the United Kingdom.Sufficient ground personnel to man both flights have been provided by Free French-Naval and Air Force personnel, all of whom have passed through Royal Air ForceSchools of Technical Training.18. Outstanding Achievements.One Free French officer serving in a R.A.F. Fighter Squadron now has tohis credit 19 enemy aircraft destroyed and two probably destroyed. He wasdecorated with the Distinguished Flying Cross in October 1941.Although no definite information has yet reached this country, it is known that the Free French Bomber Squadron serving in Middle East Command hastaken an active part in operations in the Western Desert, and has been frequentlymentioned in Middle East Command communiques.19. Training.During the period under review : 43 Free Frenchmen entered Initial Training Wing.1 Free Frenchman entered Elementarv Air Observer School.2 Free Frenchmen entered Air Observer School.5 Free Frenchmen, on completion of Signals Training, have enteredAir Gunner School for completion of training as Wireless Operator/Air Gunner.43 Free Frenchmen successfully qualified as service pilots.The Free French Maintenance personnel who were accepted into Schools of technical Training during the previous quarter have all completed their,conversion courses and have been posted for duty with No. 340 Free FrenchFighter Squadron.20. Recruiting.During the period under review, twelve officers and 59 other ranks wereincorporated into the Free French Air Force in the United Kingdom.21. Morale.The morale of Free French pilots has remained very good. The morale of ground crews has been mixed mainly as a result of a certain amount of discontentdue to the difference in pay of Free French Naval and Air Force mechanicsserving side by side in No. 340 Squadron. Negotiations are proceeding to removethis Gause for discontent.22. General.During the period under review, negotiations have been in progress betweenAir Ministry and the Free French Headquarters on the subject of the pay of,Free French personnel. It is proposed to bring Free French personnel into line with R.A.F. personnel in regard to the payment by Trade Groups. At urgent,all Free French personnel are in receipt of Group V rates of pay.
In November, General Odic, lately Commander-in-Chief of the French AirForce in North Africa, offered his services to General de Gaulle. Another recentarrival in the United Kingdom was Lieutenant-Colonel Luguet, who wasappointed Chief of Staff of the Free French Air Force.On the 10th December, a Caudron Goeland aircraft, flown by two airmenwho had been employees at a Caudron factory, made a descent at Dungeness.The two airmen have now been enlisted in the Free French Air Force, and it isunderstood that with minor repairs the aircraft can be made serviceable.The United States Government has agreed that requests for equipment forthe Free French can be included in the Lend-Lease Act. Approval for anydemands made by the Free French must be given by Air Ministry, who will thenagree to the equipment concerned being allocated from British supplies underthis Act.B.-POLISH.(i) Navy.23. Ships recently Commissioned and to Pay Off.The American Submarine, manned by a Polish crew in the United States, has reached this country. She has been renamed Jastrzab. It is under considera-tion to pay off the Submarine Wilk and employ her crew in other units of thePolish Navy until another Submarine may be available.Owing to frequent mechanical defects and old age it is under considerationto pay off the Burza for an indefinite period. No fresh manning commitment isin view for the present.24. Recruiting.Sixty-nine recruits from Canada have now arrived in the United Kingdom.In addition, twelve officers and eighty-seven ratings are expected from north russia very shortly. As these have previously served in the Polish Navy they arenot expected to require further training. They will be absorbed into existingcrews which are somewhat below complement.From, preliminary advices received from Russia, it is hoped that, in additionto the above, the first groups of an expected total of one thousand recruits maybe expected to reach this country early in April. Arrangements for their reception and subsequent training are under consideration.The Blyskawica has completed her long refit and rearmament and afterworking up has rejoined her flotilla. The Chief of the Polish Navy has expressed his great satisfaction at the manner in which the work has been carried out.The Destroyers Garland and Piorun were detached from their usual north atlantic Escort duties at the end of September and joined Force (H) for a fewweeks. The operation took them as far East as Sardinia. They were presentduring the air attack on their convoy, in the course of which H.M.S. Nelsonsustained damage, and helped to escort her back to Gibraltar. This is the first occasion on which Polish warships have come into action with any enemy in theMediterranean. The morale and health of both crews was markedly improved by their time in a warmer climate.25. Health.Negotiations are in progress for the acquisition of a Rest House nearGlasgow. This will be invaluable for those men who are suffering from the effectof three years&apos; active service, most of which has been away from their own country.26. Pay.- The revised rates of Polish Naval Pay and Allowances have been accepted in a good spirit in spite of the fact that most of the officers and petty officers have suffered substantial reductions.27. Anglo-Polish Marriages.It may be worthy of note that a large number of junior officers and ratingshave contracted marriage with British girls, noticeably in the last three months..

On two occasions the 14th Lancers, acting as enemy, surprised thedefence, once crossing a river in boats and taking Home Guard posts by surprisefrom the rear and once, when attacking an aerodrome at dawn. On this latteroccasion 2 platoons, by silent approach and skilful use of ground, surprised thedefence, which was occupied opposing a third platoon. At the beginning ofDecember, the Polish Reconnaissance Battalion took part in a Scottish Commandexercise under one of our Brigades. The speed and boldness with which thePolish Commander handled his battalion and the high standard of mechanicalefficiency of his vehicles were most noticeable.(b) Artillery Practice.Field Artillery practices have been carried out, including one with a troopof 25-prs., including anti-tank shooting.The Polish Heavy A.A. battery practised satisfactorily at Burrowhead before taking over a gun position in A.D.G.B.(c) Tanks.Tank training in manoeuvre and shooting have taken place in the LomondHills area.

This includedtheir Field Regiments which are armed with 75-mm. equipments, only 4 25-pr.guns having so far been issued, and these have been used for instructionalpurposes, including practice. The two Field Regiments are, therefore, quite ready to receive, for immediate use, the 25-pr. equipments.37. Equipment.(a) The following major items of equipment have been received since the last

Visitswere also made by the President of the Polish Republic and General Radovich,of the Yugoslav Army.. .. .47. Note by Inspector of Allied Contingents.The Polish troops. in this country go on from strength to strength.   It hasbeen decided, as a policy, to work towards a Polish Armoured Division by formingfirst one Polish Army Tank Brigade, and issues of tanks towards this end are[23334] c
proceeding. The pace of the subsequent progress depends upon the available supply of equipment, and upon the reinforcement of the Polish Army Corps byex-prisoners of war from Russia. The additional personnel required has been calculated as about 10,000.Polish officers and men are being put through preliminary instruction and exercises for training as parachutists, but the difficulties in providing aeroplanesto finish this training still exist.(iii) Air Force.48.

Note by Inspector of Allied Contingents.- The Dutch troops are making steady progress in all forms of militarytraining, and are an admirable body of men, with the well-known characteristics of their race. They have been very anxious to re-organise their contingent tomake it more mobile, but this has been put in the background by their very naturalwish to send some of these well-equipped and well-trained troops to the dutch east Indies. When it has been decided what can be sent abroad, the questionof the organisation and role of the rest will be taken up.(iii) Air Force.Naval Air Service.71. Order of Battle (see also Appendix V).No. 320 Dutch G.R. Squadron has been withdrawn from operations for aperiod of two months from the 20th December, 1941, in order to accelerate thetraining of replacement crews.72. Outstanding Achievements.In offensive strikes against enemy shipping, two ships have been sunk by no. 320 Squadron.73. Training.During the quarter 25 Dutch Naval Air Service personnel entered Service Flying training schools in the United Kingdom, having completed their elementary flying-training in the Netherlands East Indies.7 Dutch Naval Air Service personnel entered Initial Training Wing.26 Dutch Naval Air Service personnel successfully qualified as service pilots.It has been decided that the Training Flight attached to No. 320 Squadronwill be disbanded as soon as the Squadron has a full complement of trained crews.Thereafter crews will be sent for operational training to a Royal Air Force O.T.U.74. Recruiting.From the Dutch Navy and from Dutchmen who escaped from Holland, asmall number have joined the Dutch Naval Air Service.75.

The machine-gun company and 3 inch mortar units carriedout practice at the field firing range with most satisfactory results.&apos;
The artillery and anti-tank batteries carried out practice at Sennybridge,and the anti-tank battery fired with Bren attachment at Wedgnock range.In November the anti-tank battery visited the Whitworth Works at birmingham, to show the Factory personnel the 2-pdr. anti-tank gun and itsmechanism. As a result, the management hope for increased output of the weaponthey are supplying due to the keenness shown by their personnel after the visit.83. Security.Satisfactory.84. Welfare.Satisfactory. The question of the Czechoslovak Y.M.C.A..Canteen referredto in the last Quarterly Report has now been settled satisfactorily, the canteenhaving been changed from Category &quot; B &quot; to Category &quot; A.&quot;85. Morale.Good. Encouraged by the Russian successes and the fact that Czechoslovaktroops are taking part in the fighting in Libya.86. Visits.Visits have been paid by the G.O.C.-in-C, Western Command, and the inspector of Allied Contingents. On the 5th November the G.O.C.-in-C,Western Command, invested three Czechoslovak officers with British decorations,the Brigade Commander receiving the C.B. (M), the Artillery Commander theC.B.E. (M) and one officer the O.B.E. (M).87. Note by the Inspector of Allied Contingents.The Czechs are still feeling the lack of recruits. They are about to readmitto their contingent some 100 men, formerly segregated as undesirable soldiers for political and domestic reasons and enlisted in our Pioneer Corps, and expect toget a further 50 shortly.   It is to be hoped that they will now fit in,This contingent is well trained and efficient, and the Reconnaissance unit and Batteries are shortly to be stepped up in equipment, which they well deserve.In spite of the vicissitudes which their country is going through, these menretain their high spirits and confidence.(ii) Air Force.88. Order of Battle (see also Appendix V).During the period under review two Czechoslovak Fighter Squadrons were re-equipped with Spitfires. All three Fighter Squadrons are therefore nowequipped with Spitfire aircraft; :89. Operations (see also Appendix VII).Owing to adverse weather conditions there is little to report in regard toNo. 311 Squadron. The standard of operational crews remains high, but the squadron no longer benefits from several outstanding pilots and air observerswho have recently completed their operational tour of duty.90. Outstanding Achievements.A Czechoslovak pilot officer serving in a R.A.F. Squadron and flying aBeaufighter aircraft, with a Czechoslovak Sergeant as Observer /Radio,encountered five Ju. 88&apos;s during.a patrol on the night of the 12th October, 1941;destroyed two of them and damaged a third.91. Casualties (see also Appendix IX).; Two Czechoslovak Sergeant Pilots previously reported missing over enemy territory in July and August 1941 escaped and made their way into Spain. Oneof these pilots has now reached this country, and the other is at present awaitingpassage to the United Kingdom from Gibraltar.
92. Training.During the period under review 12 Czechoslovaks entered Initial Training Wing.1 Czechoslovak entered Air Observer School.8 Czechoslovaks entered Air Gunner School.11 Czechoslovaks successfully qualified as service pilots.93. Recruiting.Eighteen Czechoslovak Army officers and forty-nine Czechoslovak other rankshave been commissioned and enlisted for service with the Czechoslovak Air Force.Ten Czechoslovaks have been recruited from the Pioneer Corps and one has arrived from Russia.94. Morale.The morale of No. 311 Squadron is excellent and that of the three Czecho-slovak Fighter Squadrons remains at the same high level.95. General.Eleven Czechoslovak pilots and Wireless Operator /Air Gunners, themajority of whom have completed their operational tour of duty in the Czecho-slovak Bomber Squadron, have been posted during the quarter for duty on the trans-Atlantic Ferry Service.E.- NORWEGIAN.(i) Navy.96. Admiral Diesen, having relinquished his appointment as Commander-in-Chief at the end of August, proceeded on a visit to British ships in theMediterranean. He sailed in November and has not yet returned. CommodoreCorneliussen was promoted to Rear-Admiral and appointed Commander-in-Chief.Captain Danielsen, formerly Chief of Staff, was also promoted to Rear-Admiraland appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief.97. Ships recently Commissioned.The fourth of the corvettes originally allocated to the Norwegians wascommissioned in October.The Submarine P. 41 was commissioned by the Norwegians at the end ofNovember and has been renamed TJredd.Two more M.T.Bs. have been allocated to the Norwegians.A fifth corvette has been allocated and is expected to commission early inJ anuary.The Glaisdale, a Hunt Class Destroyer, has also been allocated to the norwegians and is expected to complete in March.The Tunsberg has been commissioned as Norwegian Naval Depot Ship,Liverpool.The Torpedo Boat Draug is to be placed in reserve, but will be kept ready for service if required.98. Training. .       ,During the past quarter a further two hundred and forty Norwegians have passed through H.M.S. Royal Arthur. The majority of these are men who haveescaped from Norway in small craft. The chief difficulty lies in their lack of knowledge of English, but most of them are keen to learn and make good progress.Their good physique is especially noticeable. One hundred Norwegian ratingsare being trained at Dumbarton as gunners for ships of the Norwegian MerchantMarine.99. Cadets.. Eight cadets have passed out of the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. their reports on the whole were up to the average, rheir first appointments are asMidshipmen in HM. ships.&apos;  A further eight are to join iii January.

The Crown Prince inspected each unit of the Brigadeduring an exercise with the 51st Division at the end of October.113. Note by Inspector of Allied Contingents..The Norwegian troops have made a marked improvement in their trainingduring the last few months. This is particularly noticeable in the junior leaders,who now really lead their men with confidence and intelligence. These youngmen have taken full advantage of our courses, and have fine material to command.They are all very busy, and happy as may be, in their present location on thecoast of Aberdeenshire.There is a project afoot to form a special Reconnaissance Unit to be trained in Iceland, for which these troops would be very suitable.(iii) Air Force.114. Training. ...During the quarter under review 9 Norwegian Air Force personnel enteredSignals School for training as Wireless Operator/Air Gunners.Pilot training continues to be given to Norwegian personnel in Canada.Arrangements have been made to give General Reconnaissance and operational training to Norwegian Air Force personnel, who will be required tojoin No. 330 Norwegian G.R. Squadron when re-equipped with Hudson aircraft in the Spring of 1942. The first crews have already entered the School of general reconnaissance in Canada.115.

Ships Due to Commission Shortly.Arrangements have now been completed for the Section Beige to man thetwo corvettes Godetia and Buttercup, and they are due to commission at the endof January. In order to complete the crews it has been necessary to pay off theQuentin Roosevelt. There are now sufficient ratings trained in all specialisedbranches for the purpose to provide complete Belgian crews Tor these corvettes.It is hoped to provide a crew for a third corvette by March.119. Training. -Reports from training establishments have been almost unanimous inpraising the Belgians for their keenness and quickness of learning. NineMidshipmen, ex-cadets from the Belgian Training Ship Mercator, have completed their training at Greenwich and are now due for promotion to Acting Sub-Lieutenants, R.N.R.

Note by Inspector of Allied Contingents.The Belgian troops, hitherto much scattered, have been concentrated inHereford and Malvern. They are doing very well the new Armoured CarSquadron shows great promise and their Battery has recently been re-equipped with 25-pdr. as a recognition of their efficiency.Their morale is an ordinary subject of conversation, particularly amongst theirsenior officers and their Government, who are apt to use it as an argument whenthey want new equipment. Personally, considering all they are going through,and their natural impatience, I think their morale has been quite satisfactory.They are conscious also of having a definite fighting value, which helps.They are to get tanks when the supply justifies it, and have been allowedto send some officers and N.C.O.&apos;s to our A.F.V. courses.
(iii) Air Force.133. Order of Battle.No. 350 Belgian Fighter Squadron formed in the United Kingdom on the12th November, 1941. This Squadron is manned by Belgians as far as air crewpersonnel is concerned, but at present the ground personnel is provided by theRoyal Air Force with the exception of a few Belgian tradesmen. arrangements are being made to train Belgian maintenance personnel, and it is hoped thateventually all the ground crews will be Belgians. The Belgian Flight in No. 131Squadron has been disbanded, but the Belgian Flight in No. 609 Squadron is retained.134. Training.During the quarter 38 Belgians entered Initial Training Wings.8 Belgians successfully qualified as service pilots.*        6 Belgians entered Schools of Technical Training.135.

Two Hunt Class Destroyers have been allocated for the Greek Navy.The crews are expected to arrive in this country from the Near East about March.Arrangements for their accommodation on arrival are under consideration. Itis not yet possible to say what training will be required in different specialisedbranches.It is also expected that two submarines will be manned, possibly in the U.S.A.The Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, has reported on the valuable workperformed by Greek Destroyers employed on convoy duties.(ii) Air Force.139. Operations.The Greek &quot; Anson &quot; Flight attached to No. 201 Group in the Middle Easthas done good work.140. Training.Small numbers of Greek flying personnel are. being given flying training in southern Rhodesia, and at least nine have already qualified as service pilots.About 120 more from the Middle East will enter Rhodesian Schools at the rateof 16 every 7 wTeeks.141. Recruiting.By the end of 1942 the Greeks hope to obtain from their Nationals in Africarecruits to bring the strength of their Air Force up to 1,400.142. General.A second Greek Fighter Squadron will be formed in the Middle East itmaintenance personnel is available in the Spring of 1942.  The Greek Authorities
have also made a request to be allowed to form one or two Medium bomber squadrons towards the end of 1942, and to increase the Coastal ReconnaissanceFlight serving in Middle East Command to the strength of a full Squadron.H. YUGOSLAV.Air Force.143. Training.Yugoslav Air personnel, wherever recruited for pilot or observer duties, willbe trained in Southern Rhodesia. It is hoped that an agreement will shortly bereached with the Union of South Africa for Yugoslavs to be trained in AircraftMaintenance and W/T in the Union. The Yugoslav air crew personnel nowunemployed at Amman will shortly be sent to Southern Rhodesia.144. Recruiting.The Yugoslav Authorities expect to recruit up to 1,800 of their Nationals for service in the Yugoslav Air Force during the course of 1942. It is, however,doubtful whether this total will be reached.145. Morale.The morale of Yugoslav personnel has not been very satisfactory. TheHurricane Flight serving in a R.A.F. Squadron under Middle East Command hasbeen temporarily disbanded.Great George Street, S.W.1,January 17, 1942. &apos;   &quot;
Summary of Morale and Progress.A. Comments. .REPORTS from all quarters testify to the continued increase in efficiency ofthe Allied Naval Forces in this country. Their keenness and loyalty are highlysatisfactory. The great majority of officers and men are as contented and happyas can possibly be expected despite their prolonged absence from home and theiranxiety about their countries and families. They are, with few exceptions,popular. Many of them have friends on shore. This state of affairs is very largely;due to the sympathetic consideration and friendliness shown to them by nearly every section of the British Navy and by many people on shore. It is, however,evident that many of the public and even some of our own Naval personnel donot yet fully understand the good work which is being done by the Allied Naviesand Merchant Navies, and that they do not show as much interest in their doingsas they might. This is apt to cause occasional discouragement. As far.as thepublic is concerned, more publicity is needed and an Inter-Allied PublicityCommittee has been formed to stimulate Press and B.B.C. interest. It is alsonatural that where duty consists of prolonged unexciting routine work, the menare apt to get depressed and discouraged.2. The spirit of the people in the Allied Merchant Services is also generallyhigh, but as the opportunities to show them recognition are fewer than in thecase with the Navies, the situation is not quite so satisfactory.3. Lack of knowledge of English is often detrimental to the best resultsbeing obtained from courses in specialised Subjects, particularly visual andW/T signals.4. Difficulty is experienced in obtaining sufficient British Liaison Officersof a suitable type, i.e., officers with sea experience, knowledge of foreign languages(although, except in the case of the French, this is of minor importance) andpossessing the necessary tact and discretion. Many of them are, however,excellent.5. Particular attention is drawn to the very satisfactory development of theSection Beige, built up out of somewhat crude material. Reports received are. full of praise of the men. The officers, who have not yet commanded their men, arestill an unknown quantity, but it is believed they will be adequate, especially the junior officers late of the Belgian sailing Training Ship Mercator, who arecompleting training at Dartmouth and Greenwich and who will then do Gunnerycourses.6. A ction taken. With reference to the comment above about our relationswith the Allies, the attention of Senior Officers has been called to C.A.F.O. 314/41and C.A.F.O. 1568/41. As any trouble that occurs is mainly in connection withthe Free French, the difference between them and other Frenchmen has been particularly emphasised.Port Amenities Liaison Officers have been directed to pay as much attentionto the requirements of Allied Navies as to our own. They have been asked to help,where they can, in furthering the welfare of the Allied Mercantile Marines inour ports.It is under consideration that whenever possible units of the Allied Naviesshould be selected to take part in special operations where a &apos;&apos; scrap &apos;&apos; is likely.Atttention has been drawn to A.F.O. 1394/41, which deals with facilities forinstruction in English, so that full advantage may be taken of the provisionsoffered, and that even in small ports classes may be formed and encouragementgiven.Further endeavours are being made to select suitable Lieutenants and sub-Lieutenants, R.N.V.R., for the Liaison Officer pool.
General.Strength of Allied Naval Forces (including Greeks and Yugoslavs, but excludingAmericans and Russians).The total number of Allied Naval personnel has increased by about 1,100 inthe last quarter and now numbers 15.930.   Total number of ships and vesselsmanned is 175.Successes.Successes have been achieved by the Dutch Submarine 0. 21, which sank aGerman Submarine, from which twelve survivors were picked up, a Vichymerchant ship of some 5,300 tons and two schooners by gunfire and ramming.The Isaac Siveers was in company with British ships off Cape Bon whentwo Italian Cruisers, one Torpedo Boat and an E-boat were sunk and renderedgood service. An aircraft of the Netherlands Fleet Air Arm sank an enemysupply ship.! Netherlands Submarines in the Far East have so far sunk eight Japanesetransports and supply ships, two tankers and one destroyer. The Dutch naval air Arm has scored hits on a Japanese Cruiser and on a tanker.The Polish Submarine Sokol is credited with a probable hit on an enemyDestroyer in the Bay of Navarino. She also torpedoed an enemy merchant cruiser and damaged another merchant ship in the Mediterranean by gunfire.The Norwegian M.T.B. 56 sank a merchant ship of about 9,000 tons.The Submarine Glaucos of the Royal Hellenic Navy torpedoed and probably sank a 3,000-ton merchant ship off Crete.Losses.Losses to be reported this quarter are several aircraft of the Dutch naval air Arm. These were lost in operations in the United Kingdom and bring thetotal losses to fourteen.   One definite success is reported above.Two Norwegian Minesweepers were also lost.Two Dutch Submarines have been lost in the Far East.Seamen in the Allied Armies.There are still far too many seamen in the Allied Armies, but political andmilitary opposition to releasing them is strong, and the number we have beenable to rescue is small.Training.The following Table (which is not necessarily complete) shows the numbersof Allied officers and men who received training in different Royal Naval estab-lishments during the quarter. The Allied Naval authorities have frequentlyexpressed their appreciation of the pains taken by those in charge of the courses in teaching both officers and men whose lack of knowledge of English sometimesmakes it no easy task.

Every opportunity is taken of impressing on local people the value of the work being done by Allied seamen.2.
