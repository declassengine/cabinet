THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1942.SECRET. Copy No.w.p. (32) 11.January 6, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.INTER-ALLIED AND INTER-IMPERIAL CO-ORDINATION.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India and the paymaster-General.THE appointment of a Supreme Commander in the South-West Pacific area,supervised or directed by a Joint Body sitting at Washington, raises in an urgentform the whole question of inter-Allied and inter-Imperial co-ordination.2. From that point of view it is worth while considering what was done inthe last war, for, even if the conditions are profoundly different, there are certainunderlying principles which may yet be applicable, even if in a modified form,3. The first principle governing inter-Allied co-ordination, as eventuallyachieved in the last war, was that all final decisions were those of the Governmentsconcerned, as represented on the Inter-Allied Supreme War Council. Thedecisions were taken by the Council and normally carried out through theordinary machinery of their administrations. The Council only included thefour main Powers, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and the United States.Neither Japan, Belgium, Portugal, Greece nor the Dominions took part in its decisions, although their representatives Avere very, occasionally present ad hocfor consultation when some subject of especial interest to a particular Governmentwas under consideration. It met at intervals of about a month at Versailles,London, or wherever convenience dictated.4. In coming to their decisions the Supreme War Council made use of the plans and recommendations prepared for them by the permanent Inter-AlliedStaff at Versailles. The one essential purpose of this organisation was to secureplans framed ab initio from an inter-Allied point of view, and not merely asad hoc compromises between the views of the separate General Staffs of the nationsconcerned. The work of the Inter-Alliecl Staff covered the whole field of the war effort, including supplies, transport, &amp;c. In the field of strategy it covered all theatres of war. Thus its plan of operations for 1918, adopted by the supreme council on the 30th January, 1918, included a proposed offensive in Palestineas well as a defensive in France and elsewhere. There was no political section,but Lieut.-Colonel Amery was attached as political adviser and also as liaison with the War Cabinet.5. The Inter-Allied Staff was purely advisory and had no executive functions of any kind. At one stage Marshal Foch was given the control of a central reserve on the Western Front as chairman of a Committee of the VersaillesStaff, but this was never put into effect. When Marshal Foch became Commander-in-Chief on the Western Front (with a co-ordinating role as regards the italian front) he took such orders as he ever received from the Supreme War Council.[23307]    &apos; &apos;
26. In exercising his functions Marshal Foch used his own personal staff.There was ho sort of Inter-Allied Staff directly concerned with the exercise ofhis command, though, no doubt, General Weygand, in the capacity of theMarshal&apos;s personal assistant, kept him in touch with that body through the chiefFrench representative on the Versailles Staff.7. So far as inter-Imperial co-ordination was concerned, this was secured by the sessions of the Imperial War Cabinet in the spring of 1917 and over, aconsiderable part of 1918. This was, in effect, the body which, while it was in session, decided British war policy, and to that extent the United kingdom representatives on the Supreme War Council may be said to have spoken for thewhole Empire. During the Peace Negotiations the Dominions and India wereseparately represented, like the lesser Allies. At the same time all the issues of major policy decided by the Council of Ten and the &quot; Big Three &quot; were previouslydiscussed with them from day to day in the British Empire Delegation, so thatthe views of the United Kingdom delegates in fact represented a co-ordinatedEmpire policy. The Empire delegates also, in their individual capacity,occasionally served on the panel of British representatives.8. It will be seen that the problem of co-ordination in the last war, thoughimportant, was relatively simple. The only enemy Navy was confined to port by our North Sea Fleet. Air operations were purely subsidiary. In the closingphase there was only one main military front. Even on this there were really only two major combatants on the side of the Allies French and British; the Dominiontroops and the Americans up to very near the end were in effect contingentsattached to the two main armies. There was no threat to the security of these islands, the Dominions, India or America.9. The present situation is entirely different. The naval issue extends overall the seas and is, and must for some time remain, unfavourable to us in onemajor theatre. The development of the air arm has completely modified navaland military tactics and strategy, besides creating a separate strategy of its ownNot only these islands, but India and most of the Dominions and Colonies of theEmpire, as well as the American possessions in the Pacific, are directly threatened.The major theatre of land operations, in Russia, is militarily entirely disconnectedand can only secure even supplies by devious and limited routes. The Russianoutlook is in any case self-centred and not disposed towards more than a very general measure of co-ordination. The two major Powers for whom co-ordinationis essential, and who are temperamentally disposed to work together, are theBritish Commonwealth and the United States. In their case again, the strategicalproblem falls into two quite separate fields, the Atlantic-Mediterranean and theFar Eastern, only linked by the question of the broad allocation of effort asbetween the two.10. The conclusion from these facts would seem to be : (a) that eo-ordina-tion of the whole Allied effort can only be planned on the broadest possible lines and more in the field of supply than of strategy; (b) that Anglo-american co-ordination should be closer, more continuous and be more directly concernedwith actual strategy; (c) that even within the wider field of Anglo-american co-ordination there is probably need for specially close co-ordination for the war against Germany and the war against Japan treated separately; in each caseco-ordination with other Allies directly concerned, e.g., Russia for the war againstGermany, and China, the Netherlands, and the Southern Dominions for the war against Japan, could be provided in the machinery both of political decision andof technical planning.11. Such a breaking up of the task of co-ordination is also largelynecessitated by geographical and political considerations. In the last war thetwo leaders most concerned, Mr. Lloyd George and M. Clemenceau, could meetmonthly without inconvenience, and could send over leading colleagues to eachother at a moment&apos;s notice. In the present case the three leading men concerned are separated by vast and dangerous distances. Two of them, President Rooseveltand M. Stalin, are, for various reasons, confined to their own part of the world,so that the three leaders can never actually meet for discussion, while such visitsas the Prime Minister has recently undertaken to America can only occur atcomparatively rare intervals.
12. It would therefore appear that wherever any body of the nature of a supreme political executive should meet, some at least of its members would be acting as delegates for the actual national leaders. On the other hand, in viewof the obvious political objections to the centralisation of all co-ordination inone capital, it will be necessary for the Supreme Council to meet at differentcentres, and probably to keep some standing political nucleus apart from anyjoint planning staff or staffs if not at all three centres, at any rate in Londonand Washington.13. The kind of organisation required to meet the requirements of socomplex a situation might possibly be something on the following lines : (i) On the Political side.(a) A very occasional meeting of the &quot; United Nations,&quot; such as have already taken place, to pass resolutions of a general character affecting policyin its broadest aspects.(b) A Supreme War Council of the three major Allies meeting alternatelyin London, Washington and occasionally Moscow or elsewhere asconvenient, at fairly frequent intervals. For this purpose the PrimeMinister would have to make available a representative of Cabinetstatus to represent him when not able to attend in person. Just as lord Milner in the last war used to pay frequent visits to Versailles,so the Prime Ministers representative might, in the intervals betweenSupreme Council meetings, spend part of his time in Washington,keeping in touch with the whole Supply organisation, with theDominion representatives in Washington and with the Joint planning staff to be set up there. President Roosevelt would no doubt appoint a corresponding representative over here, while Russia might be content to be represented by her Ambassadors.(ii) On the Planning side.(a) A joint planning staff for the whole Alliance seems unnecessary. russia would certainly not pay much attention to its recommendations otherthan those affecting the allocation of supplies. Even as between theUnited States and the British Commonwealth the broad allocation of forces as between the two main theatres of war is so much a matterof high policy that it is best left to the Governments concerned, guided by their Chiefs of Staff and by the recommendations of the two joint planning staffs suggested below.(&amp;) Two Joint Anglo-American planning staffs, one in London to deal withGermany and other European enemies, the other in Washington todeal with the war against Japan. Their normal duty would be to study the strategical situation from the point of view of the alliance as a whole, to draw up general plans or make detailed recommendations, the decision upon these being taken by the supreme war Council or by the two Governments directly concerned and carriedout through the ordinary machinery of their Chiefs of Staff.14. In the case of General WavelEs command in the South-Western pacific area, it has now been arranged that he should receive his orders through an&quot; agency &quot; consisting of the United States Chiefs of Staff together with theWashington representatives of the British Chiefs of Staff, the ultimate decision upon their recommendations resting with the President and the Prime Minister.This would seem to afford a better method of ensuring the proper channel of authority for the transmission of the final decisions of Governments than that adopted at Versailles in the last war. But it would still be desirable to supple-ment this agency by a joint planning staff as suggested above in order to ensurethat plans should be thought out ab initio from the inter-Allied point of view and not as a result of mere compromise or adjustment between two sets of Chiefsof Staff, each with its own staff looking at the problem from a separate angle.It seems essential that the purview of this organisation, especially on the navalside, should cover the whole field of operations against Japan, and&apos; not be limitedto the geographical area demarcated for General wavell&apos;s command. A corres-ponding organisation could no doubt be equally well set up in London with a
joint planning staff working directly for and under the supervision of a body consisting of our Chiefs of Staff with representatives of the American Chiefsof Staff.15. It is essential that the Dominions and India should come into the picture much more than they did in the last war, or have so far in this. For one thing, they are playing a much larger part both in the fighting services and in munitions. For another they are much more conscious of their separate andequal status as members of the Commonwealth. Lastly they are, most of them,directly threatened and are concerned not merely with sending contingents to awar which we direct, but as Australia has recently demonstrated -with theproblem of their own safety and with the reactions of their own public.16. There are practical reasons why it is more difficult than it was in thelast war to bring together an Imperial War Cabinet. Nor could such a bodyremain in sufficiently regular session to meet the real need of the situation, whichis that the point of view of the Dominions and of India should be continuouslyin the minds of the United Kingdom representatives on the Supreme WarCouncil. The simplest solution would seem to be that the Dominions should,through whatever representatives they select, and to such extent as each may desire, take part in the discussions of the Defence Committee of the War Cabinetin London and be associated with the work of the Joint Planning Staff here, while,similarly, other representatives of the Dominions would be associated with theJoint Planning Staff at Washington and with the work of the Prime Minister&apos;sWashington representative on the Supreme War Council. This need not, ofcourse, preclude Dominion Prime Ministers or other Ministers attending theWar Cabinet when convenient, or from directly taking part on occasion in the meetings of the Supreme War Council (they did so on one occasion in the last war). India is already represented on the Defence Committee by the Secretaryof State for India and his Military Secretary, and constitutionally appropriatearrangements could no doubt be made for similar representation at Washington.17. Somewhat similar arrangements could no doubt be made to associate the lesser Allies with the work of one or other of the Joint Planning Staffs. In thecase of General Wavelhs command it is understood that they are to be, directlyrepresented at his headquarters or upon his actual staff.18. The kind of organisation sketched out above has been specially devised to overcome, as far as possible, the difficulty created by the great distances betweenthe centres of government of the various Allied Powers. Even so it will be an indispensable condition for its effective working that there should be adequateair services particularly between London and Washington to permit of theswift continuous interchange of documents and of liaison personnel.19. No mere machinery of co-ordination will itself do anything beyondduplicating effort and wasting time unless somebody provides the initiative, the ideas and the determination to see those ideas worked out and agreed to in action,as well as in pious resolutions. With our wider range of interests, our widerpurview of the strategical situation, our longer experience of war, and of this war in particular, that task naturally and rightly devolves upon us. It is forus to make up our minds how this war is to be won, and to use the machineryof co-ordination in order to see to it that others come to the same conclusions and march in step with us.L. S.
