THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.SECRET.W.P. (41) 279.November 21, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document,WAR CABINET.Copy No.ACCOMMODATION FOE MARRIED COUPLES DETAINED under defence REGULATION 18b.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. DURING the first nine months of the war, all persons detained under defence Regulation 18b were accommodated in prison establishments because this was the only accommodation available. It has always, however, been thepolicy that the detention of such persons is preventive and custodial in character,and not in any way punitive, and accordingly instructions were issued inJanuary, 1940, in a White Paper (Cmd. 6162) which laid down that the conditionsof their confinement in prison should be as little as&apos; possible oppressive, due regard being had to the necessity of ensuring safe custody and maintaining order and good behaviour. Certain minimum conditions are laid down in this document,including a provision that detained persons shall be allowed to associate with one another at meals, labour and recreation, and that they shall be permitted at least one visit a week and, subject to censorship, to write two letters a week, and toreceive as many as arrive. It is also laid down that provision shall be made for regular outdoor exercise, games and recreation, and that smoking will be allowedat exercise and recreation and in rooms, except during the hours of associatedlabour. In other respects the detainees receive, under the provisions of the white paper, very much the same treatment as persons awaiting trial.2. In the summer of 1940, the number of persons detained under the regulation was increased by some 1,300 people, whose detention became necessaryin the circumstances of that time. It was impossible to accommodate these largenumbers satisfactorily in prisons, and it had always been felt thataccommodation in camps was preferable for persons detained under this regulation if it could be arranged. Accordingly, in July, 1940, a Camp atAscot Race Course was brought into use for the accommodation of detainees, anda second camp at York was taken into use in October. In March, 1941, the twocamps were merged at Huyton, near Liverpool, where a housing estate, affordingmuch better accommodation than the hutments available in the previous camps,,was taken over.3. In May, 1941, in pursuance of the powers given by the Isle of Man(Detention) Act, which had received the Royal Assent on the 10th April, thebulk of the persons detained under the Regulation were transferred to the isle of Man. They are accommodated there in two camps, one for men and one for women, consisting of boarding houses built for summer visitors; and a great many amenities, such as facilities for games and recreation and access to the sea,are available. Subject to the general control of the camp authorities, the campsare self-governing in the sense that each house runs itself under the charge of a house leader elected by the other inmates.[23177]
4. In the women&apos;s camp, which the 18b women share with alien women,almost complete freedom of movement is allowed, including access to the villageand. shopping facilities.5. Certain persons, however, have not been sent to the Isle of Man becauseof their importance as leaders of the Fascist movement, or because their detentionin conditions allowing a lesser degree of freedom is necessary on security grounds.The total number of persons now detained under the Regulation is 671. Ofthese, 44, including Sir Oswald Mosley and 9 other leaders of the British Union,are detained at Brixton, 18 who have recently been removed from the Isle of Manfor disciplinary reasons are detained at Liverpool and 24 women are detained atHolloway Prison.6. The conditions of detention of the persons detained at Brixton andHolloway have been made as little irksome as possible consistently with thecharacter of a prison establishment. The detainees are accommodated in aseparate part of the prison; they have been allowed, during the long daylighthours of the summer months, to remain outside, subject to weather conditions,until 8 p.m., and now that winter has come on they are allowed to have lightin their cells until 10 p.m., instead of the hour of 9 p.m., which applies to theother inmates of the prison. In other respects their conditions of detentionare governed by the White Paper, but they are, in fact, given very much morefreedom of association than that document prescribes.7. It has always been felt that the position of husband and wife detainedunder the Regulation was one that demanded special consideration. Arrange-ments have been made, in the few cases where men detained in Brixton Prison arethe husbands of women detained in Holloway, for the husbands to meet their wives periodically in a room set apart in Holloway Prison in complete privacyand without the supervision which normally applies to visits in prison.8. In the Isle of Man, visits between a detained husband in one camp andhis wife in the other are also allowed at reasonable intervals, though it has notbeen possible, in the conditions in a camp, to make arrangements for these visits to take place in private and without supervision. The ordinary duration of thesevisits is, however, about three hours.9. I have always taken the view that the proper solution of the problem ofthe married detainees was the provision of accommodation which would allow them to live together. Excluding the cases of Sir Oswald and Lady Mosley and admiral Sir Barry and Lady Domvile, which are considered separately in paras. 12-17 below, there are 13 married couples at present detained under the regulation. These 13 couples (with the exception of one I.R.A. couple) aredetained not in prison but in the Isle of Man the husbands at the men&apos;s campand the wives in the women&apos;s camp. It would obviously be extravagant to forma special Camp for such a small number and the only alternative is their accom-modation in one of the existing camps. It is impracticable to provide married quarters in the male 18b camp, and, apart from other difficulties about theirprovision in the women&apos;s camp, there would be great objection on security grounds to allowing men detained under Regulation 18b the liberty of movement whichobtains in the women&apos;s camp, where the detainees are free to move about the village and consort with the local inhabitants.10. Some months ago a mixed camp for enemy aliens of both sexes, mostlyrefugees, was started in the Isle of Man; this camp, which is at Port St. Mary,adjoining Port Erin, is an isolated block of private hotels, boarding houses, &amp;c,built for summer visitors, which has been shut off from the rest of the village of port St. Mary. It has hitherto been too full to permit of the accommodation in it of 18b detainees, and there are obvious objections to the introduction of persons,many of whom (e.g., members of the British Union) are anti-Semitic, to a campin which over 75 .per cent, of the inhabitants are Jewish. At present, however,the accommodation in this camp would allow of a separate house being providedfor the 18b married couples, and these couples have themselves jointly requested that they may be allowed to go there. While there may be objection from theexisting inmates of the camp if these people are transferred to it, their transfer1seems to be the only practicable arrangement that can be made.  From the security
aspect there is: no ob j ection to the transfer: It is recognised: that the opportunities of escape from.this camp are greater than from.the&apos;other camps, but it is not likely that persons who elect to take up married quarters there will endeavour to escape; no attempts at escape have, in fact, so far been made from this camp. Itwould be necessary, however, as in the case of the existing inmates of the camp, tomake admission to the camp the subject of individual selection, and there wouldbe a sanction for their good behaviour in their liability to be returned to separatedetention.11. I propose, therefore, if my colleagues approve, to make arrangements which will allow as many of these married couples as may prove on selectionto be suitable to be transferred to this camp. In the event of either husband orwife not wishing to live with the other, I would propose to leave them both wherethey are.12. There remain the cases of Sir Barry and Lady Domvile and Sir Oswaldand Lady Mosley, who are at present detained, the husbands at Brixton Prisonand the wives at Holloway. In the ordinary way it would, I think my colleagues will agree, not be appropriate for individual cases for which the Home secretary is responsible in his quasi-judicial capacity to be brought before the WarCabinet. I mention these cases because special considerations of policy arise inthe case of Sir Oswald and Lady Mosley.13. I have recently received from the Advisory Committee a reportrecommending the release of Lady Domvile, and I propose to accept thisrecommendation, so that no question concerning this case arises in this connexion.14. As regards the Mosleys, it is not necessary in this memorandum to go into the details. The cases have been fully considered by the AdvisoryCommittee, and in reports dated respectively 29th July, 1940, and 4th October,1940, the Committee recommended without hesitation that the detention of bothSir Oswald and Lady Mosley should be continued.15. In the light of the findings of fact by the Advisory Committee my predecessor and I were bound to give special consideration to the arrangementsfor the detention of Sir Oswald and Lady Mosley, both on security and on general political grounds. In the summer of 1940, when arrangements weremade to transfer to camps the great bulk of the persons detained under regulation 18b, it was decided that it would be inappropriate that Sir oswald mosley and other leaders of the British Union should be included in the personstransferred to camps where, apart from the considerations just mentioned, theywould have had opportunities, under the greater freedom of camp life, of exercising an undesirable influence on the other detainees and hardening them intheir Fascist attitude. Sir John Anderson accordingly decided that they must remain in prison, and I have taken the same view.16. In deciding now whether there is any alternative to their continued detention in prison, there are two overriding considerations, one of a practical and the other of a political character. As regards the former, it must be accepted that the conditions of life in prisons, which were not designed for the continuanceof married life, are such that it would, to say the least, be extremely difficult toarrange for the detention of Sir Oswald and Lady Mosley in prison in conditionswhich would enable them to live as husband and wife.&apos; As regards the latterconsideration, I am firmly persuaded that public opinion would strongly resent any arrangement which could be represented as giving to Sir Oswald and lady Mosley any preferential treatment as compared with that given to other persons detained under Regulation 18b.17. If- these principles are accepted, it follows that the only alternative tothe continuance of the present arrangements is to transfer Sir Oswald and lady Mosley to the mixed camp in the Isle of Man, where they would be segregatedfrom their followers, who are detained in a separate camp. It is relevant to mention in the first instance that, in a petition submitted to me so recently as the27th September, Sir Oswald Mosley, in asking that arrangements might be madefor husbands and wives to be interned together, specifically asked that the internment, though outside London,; should not be so remote as to impose:

Apart from his owndesires, his removal to the Isle of Man would be unpopular with the authoritiesand ^population of the island. Although the Security Service are preparedto agree to his transfer to the Isle of Man with his wife, there is the risk;that,though it could be represented that he was not being given any preferential treatment, an arrangement of this kind might be misunderstood, both in thiscountry and abroad, particularly in Russia, and might be interpreted as an indication that the Government was taking the first step towards &apos;&apos; appeasement &apos;&apos;with the Fascists.H.
