In view of the rapidity with which events are moving in the Far EastI did not feel justified in delaying the communication to you of the conclusionsat which I have already arrived, although I have not completed the tour of visitsthat I had intended. I have spent the greater part of two months in Singaporewhere I have had the advantage of consultation not only with the local authorities,military and civil, but also with His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to China and HisMajesty&apos;s Minister at Bangkok, who were good enough to come here for thepurpose. I have visited the Netherlands East Indies, Burma and India, and am now about to go to Australia and New Zealand. I hope later to pay a visit to hong Kong, which has proved impossible in the time at my disposal. If I should wish to alter or add to my report I shall be able to communicate such alterationsor additions by telegraph.2. The disadvantage of not having paid these visits is less than that ofbeing in ignorance of the results that have attended the experiment of appointing a Minister of State in the Near East. Captain Lyttleton&apos;s experience and advicewould, of course, have been of the greatest value, but counsels of perfection must give way before the imminence of war.3. The Far East seems likely to play a part of increased and increasing importance both in the present war and in the future of the world. This newimportance is due principally to two causes, the first material and the secondpsychological. The first is the revolution that has recently taken place in the case and speed of communications the second is the change in the mental attitudeof oriental populations.4. The chief reason why the peoples of Asia have played so small a partin the history of the modern world has been the vast distances that divided them from one another, which rendered collaboration impossible, war unnecessary, andisolation easy and desirable. A hundred years ago Japan was still able to main-tain the system which rendered it impossible for foreigners to land upon hershores or for natives to leave them; and fifty years ago the Dowager Empress of[23187] &apos; b
2China was still holding at arm&apos;s length the representatives of the most powerfulcountries, and could give careful consideration to a proposal for the massacreof all Europeans in her capital, while the King of Burma could cheerfully embark,without allies, on a war with the British Empire.5. The blissful ignorance enjoyed by the peoples of these countries couldonly be maintained so long as the natural barriers of oceans, mountains and desertscontinued to divide them both from one another and from the remainder of the human race. We have witnessed in our own time the gradual disappearance ofthe functions which those natural barriers have performed in the past. the telegraph, the telephone, steam, the internal combustion engine, and finally theaeroplane have gradually but completely robbed the oceans, mountains and desertsof their power to divide countries from one another.6. It is worth noting, however, for the purpose of this report, that despite their recent development communications are temporarily suffering from suchgreat interference as seriously to affect the position in the Far East. Owing tothe fact that Great Britain is practically cut off from the Continent of Europewritten communications with India and other parts of Asia which before thewar took a few days how take at least as many weeks. Urgent matters are, ofcourse, dealt with by cable, but while it is difficult to convey a correct andconvincing picture of a political situation in a despatch, it is quite impossibleto do so in a telegram, and the inevitable result must be that those who areresponsible for carrying out British policy in Asia are less closely in touch thanthey have been for a long time with those who are responsible for framing that policy in London. And this unfortunate, if inevitable, state of affairs occurs at a mount when events in Asia may prove of more vital importance to Great Britainthan at any previous period.7. The second reason for the increased importance of the Far East is thefact that many of the principal nations concerned have recently passed throughthat trying experience which is not inaptly described as &quot; awakening/&apos; Themeaning of the word is, roughly, that peoples become aware of their existence asa nation among other nations. In the last century the Chinese believed that theworld was inhabited by themselves on the one hand and a number of unimportantbarbarians on the other, while for the Japanese the earth ended at the sea shorewhich surrounded their islands. These illusions were rudely shattered by the.nations of the West and we are now faced by vast populations of industrious,intelligent and brave Asiatics who are unwilling to acknowledge the superiority of europeans or their right to special privileges and powers in Asia.8. Japan, which had been the most backward, became the most forwardnation in seeking by the adoption of Western methods to hold her own with theWestern Powers. The striking success which she achieved secured imitators.Apart from developments in India and Persia, with which this report is not concerned, we have seen Burma demanding and receiving a constitution, and still asking for more; we have seen Siam changing her ancient name to Thailandin a spirit of nationalism, and we have seen the Philippines accorded by theUnited States Government complete independence in principle which is to be converted into practice within a few years.9. It is now thirty years since China overthrew her Manchu rulers andproclaimed herself a Republic. But greater developments have taken place withinChina recently as the result of Japanese aggression, and according to all observersthe Chinese people are more united as a nation to-day than they have ever been before, an event which, remembering that they consist of over 440 million of thehardest working and most intelligent people in Asia, may have far greaterconsequences than it is possible to foresee.10. The Dutch East Indies also contain a population half as great againas that of Great Britain, among whom the rumbling of nationalist aspirationsbegins to be audible.11. This awakening of the peoples has been followed by a fundamental change in their conditions. From being entirely agricultural they have becomelargely industrial populations and as such they must be recognised as importantcompetitors of Europe in the markets of the world.
12. Nor has this growth of self-awareness been confined to the inhabitants of Asia. Great Britain is the European Power most closely concerned in Asiaticdevelopments, but the portion of the British Empire most vitally affected by events in the Pacific is the Commonwealth of Australia. It is not too much to saythat the security of Singapore is of greater importance for Australia than thesecurity of Gibraltar is for Great Britain. Thoughtful Australians are well aware of this fact, and the number of thoughtful Australians is increasing. &quot;Withthat increase comes the desire and the demand, more often and more clearly-expressed, to be consulted with regard to and to be allowed to influence any-political or military decisions which may affect that part of the world which lies closest to the Antipodes.13. Both Australia and New Zealand have magnificently demonstrated theirdevotion to the cause of Britain and have earned the right to full partnershipin the direction of foreign and colonial policy which is likely to affect the fate of the dominions.14. Within this changed, and ever changing world of the Pacific the affairs of the British Empire were being conducted at the outbreak of war by machinerythat has undergone no important change since the days of Queen Victoria. FourGovernment Departments were principally concerned. Two Ambassadors and oneMinister reported to the Foreign Office on the affairs of Japan, China and Siam,while the same department was kept informed by Consul-General of eventspassing in the Netherlands East Indies, in the Philippines and in French Indo-China. The Governors of the Straits Settlements and of Hong Kong reportedto the Colonial Office. The Dominion Office was represented by high commissioners in Australia and New Zealand, and the recent bestowal uponBurma of a Secretary of State of her own brought the India Office into the picture..Here, then, already existed a system under which four different types of officialreported to and received orders from four different departments of State, and,save for the fact that the Ministers responsible for the departments met weeklyin Cabinet, no effort was made to co-ordinate the activities of the officials or the policies of the departments concerned.15. That such a system was impracticable in wartime soon became apparent,and efforts were made to supply deficiencies whenever and wherever they appeared.These were undertaken upon no preconceived basis and were applied locally andspasmodically without any relation to one another, and -usually without prior-consultation with the authorities on the spot. The result has been to add to thenumber of Government departments involved and to multiply the number of officials employed.16. The Ministry of Information, rightly perceiving the necessity for controlling and co-ordinating propaganda in the Far East, set up a Far EasternBureau, which was at first situated at Hong Kong and later at Singapore. Thehead of the bureau is responsible only to his own Ministry and his task has notbeen rendered easier by the competition of other departments in the realm of propaganda.-17. The Commander-in-Chief, Far East, soon after his arrival suggestedthat the Commander-in-Chief, China, should set up a Services Public relations office, which he proceeded to do, placing at the head of it a retired naval commander who had spent the last twenty years as a magistrate in the FijiIslands. This office known to the press correspondents from its initial lettersas &quot; Aspro &quot; maintained no liaison with the Ministry of Information^ bureauwhile performing many of its duties. A good deal of confusion consequentlyarose, and the press correspondents were the principal sufferers.18. Later, the Ministry of Economic Warfare came upon the scene.Hitherto the Far Eastern Bureau of the Ministry of Information had been carrying on all propaganda, including some of a most secret nature. This latterbranch of its activities was suddenly transferred to the newly-arrived representa-tives of another department. It is much to the credit of the officials of bothdepartments concerned that they have succeeded in reaching a completely amicableand workable agreement between themselves. The virtues of the individuals^however, should not be allowed to screen the vices of the system.[23187] b 2
19. The Ministry of War Transport has also appointed representatives in hong Kong, and the Treasury have created a Financial Commissioner for theFar East with headquarters at Shanghai.20. Meanwhile a system has arisen, more by chance than by design, underwhich the Commander-in-Chief, China, performs certain duties which seldomfall to the lot of a Naval Officer. Since the fall of France, in the words ofVice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton himself in a memorandum on his duties withwhich he was good enough to provide me, &apos;&apos; relations between British authoritiesin the Far East and the Government of Indo-China have been particularly the concern of Commander-in-Chief, China.&quot; In the discharge of these diplomaticduties the Admiral signed a treaty Avith Admiral Decoux on the 18th January,1941. He admits regretfully in the same memorandum that the &quot; Governmentof Indo-China has felt itself compelled to depart considerably from both the letter and the spirit of this agreement&quot; but adds that it has been retained in force.21. It has also been part of his duty &quot; to sponsor the Free French movementin the Far East,&quot; and the manner in which he has succeeded in maintaining thehappiest relations with the Free French while signing agreements with therepresentatives of Vichy testifies to the truth of the tradition that there is not ask to which a British sailor cannot successfully turn his hand.22. Commander-in-Chief, China, has also certain diplomatic relations withThailand since the Naval Attache to the legation at Bangkok is a member of his staff. These relations have been mainly concerned with the supply of commodities,such as oil, to Thailand.23. Here again the success with which Sir Geoffrey Layton has carried out,these duties is no justification for a system under which foreign policy is framedand diplomatic negotiations are conducted by a Vice-Admiral. I am unawarewhether the policy of uniting Vichy French and Free French in Indo-Chinaagainst Japan had the approval of the Foreign Office. The representative in singapore of the Ministry of Information was certainly in ignorance of it. his instructions were to pour scorn on the representatives of Vichy, which led himto describe the Vichy radio transmissions from Saigon as &apos;&apos; The Voice of Tokyo &apos;&apos; a phrase which incurred the censure of the Commander-in-Chief, China, as notbeing in accordance with his policy.24. An additional reason why the conduct of these political affairs shouldnot be left in the hands of the principal Naval Officer on the China Station isthat, in the event of hostilities, that officer would presumably be at sea and there-fore no longer available. Similar arguments apply to the Commander-in-Chief,Far East, who has also felt bound on occasion to intervene in political affairs andwho would doubtless be glad to be relieved of such responsibilities.25. The Foreign Office, hitherto unrepresented at Singapore, have recentlyproposed to send out an ex-Consul-General on whom the status of Counsellor inthe Diplomatic service would be conferred. His duty was to be the maintenanceof &quot; contact, by means of personal visits, between His Majesty&apos;s representatives in China, Japan and Siam and His Majesty&apos;s Consular Officers in the netherlands east Indies, the Philippines and Indo-China, on the one hand, and the governors of the Straits Settlements, Burma and Hong Kong and Commanders-in-Chief, far east and China, on the other.&quot; His functions were to be entirely consultative,not executive.26. The Foreign Office were good enough to consult me with regard to thisappointment and I asked them to defer it pending the receipt of my report. I felt that it would increase rather than diminish complications and would addanother ineffective wheel to the machine. The fact that the new official would be finferior in rank to all those between whom it would be his business to maintaincontact would render it difficult for him to do more than &quot;repeat to one the viewsthat had been expressed to him by the others. His functions being purely con-consultative would debar him from taking over the diplomatic duties hithertoperformed by the Admiral. In practice he would become little more than acourier.   In theory it is surely unsound to attempt to co-ordinate from below.
27. There also exists at Singapore, under the control of the Commander-in-Chief, China, a Far Eastern Combined Intelligence Bureau. On this bureau,which collects and disseminates information, not only are all three services repre-sented, but there are also officers from the Dutch and the United States services,who convey such information to Batavia and Manila and supplement it from sources at their own disposal. This bureau is performing most useful work, butthe lack of a civilian branch creates a danger of the political, diplomatic or economic value of information received not always being correctly estimated, andit may well be that a representation of the Foreign Office on this body might serve a very useful purpose.28. It will be apparent that the organisation described above, consistingas it does of a number of Government departments working through their repre-sentatives each within their own sphere, independently of one another and sometimes in ignorance of each other&apos;s action, could not be expected to produceentirely satisfactory results. But to say that it is working very badly would beto convey a false impression. What is surprising is that the system or rather the lack of system is working as well as it is. The reasons for this are two first the high quality and devotion to duty of ail the officials military and civilianconcerned; secondly their patriotic determination in time of war to co-operate with one another and to sink minor differences. In peace time the mostconscientious worker may be pardoned for thinking it more important to improvean imperfect machine than to produce the goods, but under the urgent stressof war the demand for the goods is imperative and it has been magnificentlyresponded to by all the British officials in the Far East. None of those officials,however, would deny that the conditions under which they work stand in need of reform. That this is so, the appointment of a special mission of enquiry shouldalone afford sufficient proof. It is not proposed to lengthen this report by citingconcrete instances of the errors, delays and misunderstandings that have arisen.The minutes of the Far Eastern Committee which has been sitting during thelast year in London, and which in itself represented an attempt at reform andan acknowledgment of the need for it, show the large number of cases which are referred for settlement to London whereby months of delay are incurred. Manyof these cases could, if the machinery existed, be settled on the spot with a saving of time, labour and expense and an increase of efficiency. Study of the minutesof the Far Eastern Committee further reveals that in many cases where referenceto London is clearly necessary, such reference is at present often made from one quarter alone in the Far East which necessitates further enquiries being made from London of other quarters in the Far East, and thus prolonged delay is incurred. If the various interested parties in the Far East had one superiorofficial on the spot whom they could consult in the first instance, he having heardall the views expressed could present the problem in a digested form to london for settlement, supplying London with all the facts and arguments and renderingit unnecessaxy for the authorities at home to make further enquiries.29. It is also important to remember that the lack of co-ordination whichhas called for this enquiry has been detected during a period in which the warin Europe had not yet spread to the Pacific. Among those in the Far East whohave been consulted there were some who held the view that so long as this stateof affairs continued there was no immediate cause for anxiety, and that thesystem which had been allowed to work so long might well be allowed to continueworking. There was, however, not one individual among those consulted whobelieved that it could possibly be allowed to continue if war broke out betweenthe Great Powers in the Far East.30. There would then immediately arise a situation similar to that whichhas necessitated the appointment of a Minister of State in the Near East.Indeed, the causes which rendered that appointment necessary would exist in anaggravated form, because there are certain to be more important and a larger number of political issues which will need handling upon the spot, and the distance from London being far greater will increase the difficulty of dealingwith them at home.31. In the Mediterranean there were no interests of important Allies to beconsidered; in the Pacific, the United States, Russia, China and Holland are all
vitally concerned. In the Mediterranean Australia was fighting for the Empire;in the Pacific she will be fighting for her life. Canada also is a Pacific Power,and in such a war the ports of South Africa must prove of the first importance.32. The necessity, therefore, for an improved system in time of war may betaken as admitted. But it does not follow that what will be suitable in war isdesirable in peace. On the other hand, the introduction of an entirely new systemafter war has broken out is. if possible, to be avoided. The problem thereforeresolves itself into seeking for a system which shall be an improvement upon thatwhich exists and which shall admit of easy adaptation to war conditions whenthe occasion shall arise.33. The first proposal for reform which deserves serious consideration isthe creation of a State Department with a Secretary of State to deal with far eastern affairs. This proposal has much to recommend it. It is at least question-able whether modern conditions will admit of the indefinite continuation of theForeign Office system under which, for instance, the Head of the AmericanDepartment can be an official who has never set foot on the American Continent,and an official who has never visited the Far East or had any dealings, with theChinese can be appointed Ambassador to China. This system has often provedbrilliantly successful, but it is not one which would recommend itself, on its face value, to any body of experienced men of affairs. The age is one of ever-increasingspecialisation and speeding up. Statesmen must rely upon the advice ofspecialists, and they should be able to count upon finding them in the highestposts of tlae civil service. The creation of a Far Eastern Department would entail the creation of a Far Eastern Service from which would be drawn all thosewho now fill diplomatic, consular or colonial posts in the Far East.34. I will not expatiate on the merits of this scheme because I do not intend to recommend its adoption, but I would urge that it should receive very serioiisconsideration because I do believe that it will provide the ultimate but not theimmediate solution of the problem.35. I do not recommend its adoption at the present time because the benefits of it could hardly be felt in less than two or three years, and its introductionwould be inevitably accompanied by considerable temporary dislocation andpossibly confusion which would be most undesirable in time of crisis.36. The proposal which I had in mind before leaving London and whichI tentatively laid before some of the officials with whom I discussed the matter was the creation of a Council for. the..Far East, situated at Singapore, on whichshould be represented all the territories and interests concerned, and which should sit under the Chairmanship of a Cabinet Minister. Such a Council would notbe dissimilar from what, I understand, exists in Cairo under the chairmanship of the Minister of State. The services would be represented on it as well ascivilian interests, and all matters connected with the prosecution of the war would come under discussion.37. Until, however, the war spreads to the Pacific, such matters would bevery limited in number and would hardly justify the creation of a standing body to discuss them. There does exist a Defence Council at Singapore on which thefighting services and the civilian officials of the Colony are represented. It has met seldom, and the infrequency of its meetings testifies to the lack of any urgent need for its existence.38. The suggestion to set up such a Council in existing conditions has notbeen received with enthusiasm by any of those before whom it has been laid.There is apprehension that it might easily develop into a cumbersome andunwieldy body. It would, for instance, be difficult to have only one representativefor such a large dominion as Australia which would need to have its commercial,economic and labour as well as&quot;iTs purely military interests watched. If Australiawere represented, Canada and even South Africa might claim to be, and some-thing in the nature of an Empire Parliament might come into being whichwould have to be consulted and treated with due deference and which might easily prove a formidable cause of confusion and delay.
39. Difficulties would also arise in connection with the representation of burma and India, neither of which could easily be excluded. Questions of colourand religion would be inevitable and serious political complications might ensue.40. i found in the pursuit of my enquiries that complaints of lack ofco-ordination between British Authorities were far less common than complaints of a lack of co-operation between ourselves and our Allies. Complaints of this nature came to me from our own authorities, from those of our Allies and perhapsmost frequently from such more or less detached spectators as American press correspondents who, constantly travelling from one country to another, are struckby the lack of collaboration and even of common information. The Governor-General of the Netherlands East Indies a highly competent official expressedsome surprise as well as considerable relief when I told him that Great britain was anxious to avoid war with Japan. He told me that he had had no previouswarning of America&apos;s decision to freeze Japanese assets, although such a decision was of the greatest importance to the- Netherlands East Indies, whose whole tradewith Japan was conducted in American currency, and when he asked what information I had with regard to negotiations reported to be proceeding betweenthe United States and Japan I was bound to admit that I was in completeignorance even as to whether such negotiations had ever been opened anignorance which he shared. In the same connection His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Chungking recently drew the attention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the lack of co-ordination in the help given to China by Great Britain and the UnitedStates.   (Sir A. Clark Kerr&apos;s telegram No. 421 of 24th August.)41.   This lack of inter-allied co-operation would not be remedied in any wayby the creation of a Council upon which, presumably, only^the,yjiricjisJjiterests)of the JBjjtijh-JEmpixe- would be represented.    Nor could the extension of(representation to the Allied Powers be contemplated, tending, as it would, tothe creation of a miniature League of Nations.42. The multiplication of authorities, councils and committees is, inprinciple, to be avoided, and for all these reasons it would seem undesirable atpresent to set up a council of the nature contemplated. At the same time, it mustnot be forgotten that for the reasons given in paragraph 30 something of the kind would certainly be required in case of war. On this point opinion is almostunanimous. There would seem to be no necessity for prior discussion concerningthe composition of this War Council. Such discussion might provoke claims from many quarters tTraT^wuiiTcr be difficult to deny and might prove embarrassing togrant. It will be a Council of War and its membership must be dictated by the exigencies of the moment. The most important member of it will clearly be theChairman, or President, to whom should be left some latitude in the selection ofhis colleagues.43. Although it is undesirable to set up this War Council in anticipation of the outbreak of war, there is every reason for taking any action in advancewhich will facilitate its creation when the time arrives; The Council itself cannotbe kept in cold storage and produced on the appropriate day, but the same doesnot apply to the Chairman or President. His will be a task of great difficulty and high responsibility. He cannot be too well prepared for it. If an interval is toelapse between his selection and the time when he will be called upon to performhis duties, that interval could not be better spent than in making himself closelyacquainted with the territories, the personalities and the problems with whichhe will have to deal. Not only could he thus prepare himself for the moreimportant duty, but he could at the same time fulfil a very useful function.There would, therefore, seem to be every reason why the individual in question should be selected with the least possible delay, should be furnished with thenecessary staff and should receive his instructions.44. The territory with which he will be concerned comprises a vast portionof the earth&apos;s surface. On the one side it is bounded by the western seaboard ofthe American Continent, on the other by the wastes of Siberia and the sub-continent of India. Not only should he therefore maintain the closest relationswith the countries that lie between these landmarks, but he should also keep intouch with what lies beyond them, as both the United States and India are closely
concerned with all that passes in the Far East. How far it may be possible or desirable for him to maintain liaison with Russia must be decided in the light of future events.45. I have said above that, in my first conception of the Council, I envisageda Cabinet Minister as being the suitable head. Further reflection has caused meto alter this view. I see both practical and constitutional difficulties in the way.A Cabinet Minister is responsible to Parliament and, while he need not be alwaysavailable, it should be possible for him to appear in his place without too lengthya delay. Cairo is still within two or three days of London, but two or threeweeks divide London from Singapore.46. Further, this official will be dealing with foreign, colonial, Burmese and dominion affairs, for all of which Secretaries of State must continue to bear thefull responsibility. In theory, all Cabinet Ministers are, with the exception ofthe Prime Minister, equals, and as such they cannot take orders from one another.It will be the duty of the official in question to interpret and cany out the policyof the Ministers in charge of the departments concerned. It will certainly not be his duty to have a policy of his own. He must therefore be subordinate to those whose policy he is carrying out, to whom he should report and to whom he mustbe responsible.47. I have referred above to the diplomatic activities of the Commander-in-Chief, China, who has been conducting negotiations with the Free French andwith the representatives of Vichy. These duties were performed by Sir GeoffreyLayton, not because he had any desire to intervene in spheres other than naval,but because there was no one else in Singapore to perform them. This gap willbe filled by the new official, but it must be the policy of the Foreign Secretary thathe will carry out and to the Foreign Secretary he must apply for instructions.48. It may be objected that a situation will be created in which there willbe one servant with many masters. It may sound illogical in theory, but needcause no difficulties in practice. The official will experience no embarrassment in deciding upon which subjects he must report to whom. During this brief missionI have frequently had occasion to write or telegraph to one or other of mycolleagues about some point that arose concerning their departments.49. The relations between the suggested official and other Ministers con-cerned would be on exactly the same footing as his relations with the secretaries of State. His duty would be to assist..and advise the representatives in the far east of all Government Departments. Owing to his higher status and presumablycloser acquaintance with&quot; the minds of Ministers he would doubtless often feelqualified to authorise action which a lower official would feel bound to referhome just as an Ambassador will take a decision where a Charge d&apos;Affaireswould ask for guidance. He should be encouraged to assume responsibilities ofthis nature, and the representatives of Government Departments should be instructed to apply to him for decisions in cases where it seems important toavoid delay.50. Differences of opinion occasionally arise between the representatives oftwo or more Government Departments. These should be submitted to the newofficial for arbitration. It would, however, perhaps be wise to leave to the con-tending parties the right of appeal to their respective Ministers if they weredissatisfied with the decision.51. Normally, relations between Government Departments and their repre-sentatives in the Far East would remain unaltered. The latter would report and receive instructions in the usual way through the usual channels. Only in exceptional cases of emergency would recourse be had to the new machinery.52. It would perhaps be well at this juncture to give concrete examples ofthe kind of work the new official might perform.53. I have been struck, in the course of my enquiries, by the lack which appears to exist of any economic co-operation between the various interested parties and the absence of any machinery to secure it. This was especiallyemphasised to me by Dr. Gregory, economic adviser to the Government of India.
He suggested that a real and urgent need existed for getting together theprincipal people concerned, if possible in an informal manner, in order to discussthe situation. Anything, however, in the nature of an official conference withthe publicity it would involve and the political difficulties it might raise was tobe avoided. On my return to Singapore I discussed the matter with Sir GeorgeSansom, Adviser to the Far Eastern Mission of the Ministry of economic warfare, who shared entirely the views of Dr. Gregory, and we decided, afterobtaining the assent of the Governor of the Straits Settlements, that I should invite the Viceroy and the Governors of Burma and Hong Kong to send represen-tatives here early in December to talk over certain matters. His Majesty&apos;ammbassadors in Chungking and Tokyo, His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Bangkok, andthe Consul-General in Batavia are also being invited to send representatives.54. It was generally agreed that the demand for some such action existed,but there was no machinery to focus that demand. It was the business of nobodyin particular to give voice to it, and if anybody did decide to give voice to it,there was nobody in particular to whom he could apply. I myself hesitated atfirst to assume the responsibility, but having re-read my terms of reference I felt-no doubt that the proposed conference would prove the best possible method of continuing my investigations.55. Another incident may be quoted as affording evidence of the natureof the reform that is required. Some time ago the chief representatives here ofthe Ministries of Information and Economic Warfare came to see me with a plan that they had worked out in agreement as to the best means of co-ordinatingtheir activities. Their reason for consulting me was that they thought my previous experience as Minister of Information might be of value. I approvedof their plan and suggested a slight alteration which would link them up more closely with the Foreign Office. I then sent a telegram to the three departmentsconcerned, asking for approval of the plan. After a delay of exactly four weeksI received a reply to the effect that the Ministers concerned approved of the plan in principle. A suggestion, however, was put forward that must lead to furthercorrespondence.56. Under the high pressure of work resulting from war conditions thedepartments are not in any way to be blamed. To obtain an agreed reply from three Government Departments must take time, and it- is perfectly right thatwhen a proposal is put before a number of civil servants they should suggest animprovement on it. But a great^deal of time as well as labour would have been saved had I been in a position to say to these highly-placed and experiencedrepresentatives of Government Departments that I approved of their plan, thatthey could proceed to put it into operation, and that I would report to the depart-ments what had been done and take the responsibility.57. There is further to be considered the relations which should exist between the new official and the military authorities. I have met with the greatestkindness and co-operation from the latter since I have been in the Far East. Ihave visited the various military establishments and discussed matters with the commanding officers and their staffs.58. The system under which two Commanders-in-Chief, one for the far east and one for China, live side by side at the Naval Base at Singapore doesnot appear to be a sound one in theory, and has in practice led to considerableinconvenience. There are also a General Officer Commanding, Malaya, and an air Officer Commanding, Far East, at the other end of the island.59. The impression that I personally formed from such enquiries as I made into the state of the defences of Malaya and of Burma led me to the conclusionthat the former was somewhat overinsured at the expense of the latter. when expressed this opinion to the Commander-in-Chief, India, he told me that heshared it. He also strongly held the view that the defences of Burma should come under the control of the Commander-in-Chief, India. This view was supported by the Viceroy and by the Governor of Burma.60.   Apart from the political aspect of the question, which is important fromthe Burmese angle, my own view is that a war in the Far East is more likelyto include Burma and Malaya, excluding India, than to include Burma andIndia, excluding Malaya.  If the first alternative is accepted as the more probable[23187] c
it&apos; would seem logical to retain Burma and Malaya under the same command inorder to avoid having two Commanders-in-Chief conducting one campaign.Further, if Burma were withdrawn from the area controlled by the Commander-in-Chief, Far East, the latter would be left with nothing but the land defencesof Malaya and Hong Kong to concern him-hardly a sufficient territory tojustify so extensive a title.61. The new official whose appointment this report recommends would, ofcourse, have no authority whatever in military matters, but he must certainlykeep himself fully informed of the military situation in preparation for the timewhen he might find himself presiding over a Council of War before which therewould come up for decision matters the military and political aspects of whichmight be inextricably combined.62. He would also be at liberty to express opinions from time to time on military problems, either to the War Cabinet or to the Service Minister concerned,as I have ventured to do in the preceding paragraphs.63. He would, moreover, keep in the closest possible touch with the militaryauthorities, continually discussing with them the political and diplomaticsituation in order that they might be in full possession of the latest informationderived from the various sources at his disposal, both at home and abroad.64. Apart, however, from the duties referred to above, it would be theprime function of the new official to keep the War Cabinet furnished with acomplete picture of the whole situation in the Far East. There is nobody chargedwith that duty at the present time, and the War Cabinet are presented with thecomponent parts of a jigsaw puzzle many of which are missing and all of whichare supplied and painted by different hands.65. It will equally be his duty to keep the authorities in the Far Eastinformed of the views and plans of the War Cabinet, a task that cannot be accomplished by cable or despatch, and which can only be performed by somebodypossessing the necessary background and experience.66. In addition to the possession of these qualities, it would seem that theproposed official must devote a great part of his time to travel, since the situationin every country undergoes rapid transformation in time of war. Nor, as already indicated, should his travels be confined to the countries with which he will beprincipally concerned. He should keep himself acquainted with developmentsboth in India, the United States and, if possible, with Russia, and he should return at intervals to England.67. This definition of duties leads to consideration of the type of individualto be selected. For reasons already given I do not recommend that he should be aCabinet Minister, and the same objections apply in a lesser degree to an ex-Cabinet Minister or a member of the House of Commons.68. On the other hand, no junior official, such as a Counsellor or even a minister in the diplomatic service, however brilliant his personal attainments,could cope with the position. He must be a man who in his conferences withAmbassadors, Governors and Commanders-in-Chief can speak on terms of equality and who, when he visits India, will be received by the Viceroy and in washington by the President. A former Ambassador or some exceptionallydistinguished civil servant would seem to provide the type of man required.69. It remains to confer upon this official a local habitation and a name also a staff. With regard to the first it would seem certain that his headquartersmust be at Singapore.70. So far as his title is concerned I would propose that he should be called the Commissioner-General for the Far East, a sufficiently vague and compre-hensive term which can be made to cover any duties he may be called upon to perform. It has also the advantage of distinguishing him from high commissioners, of whom there are many already.71. The staff that the Commissioner-General will require will not benumerous. It is, however, of the first importance that he should have an exceptionally able and experienced principal assistant who will be obliged toact for him in his absence and on whom a great deal of work of a highly responsible
character will fall. Allusion has already been made to the growing importanceof the part played by Australia in Far Eastern affairs and the desirability of associating that Dominion more closely in the control and direction of policy.An effort might therefore be made to find a suitable Australian to fill the post of principal assistant.72.   Under the principal assistant I suggest that there should be three officexs.^-,of equal standing to deal respectively with foreign, colonial and defence affairs.The Commissioner-General and the principal assistant will require privatesecretaries who with the necessary clerical staff should complete the mission.73. It may be well to recapitulate the argument. The importance of theFar East in world affairs has much increased but British organisation in theFar East has not kept pace with this development. Reform is necessary, butdrastic reform is undesirable in time of crisis. If war spreads to the Pacificit will be necessary to set up a Council of War similar to that which has been setup at Cairo. Preparation should now be made for the creation of this council by the selection of its Chairman who can meanwhile perform certain importantduties.74.   I therefore recommend :  (1) That there be appointed a Commissioner-General for the Far East witha small staff and permanent headquarters at Singapore.(2) That he shall keep the War Cabinet informed of Far Eastern affairs and keep officials, military and civilian, in the Far East in touch withthe policy of the War Cabinet.(3) That he shall prepare the way for the establishment of a Council of war should it become necessary.(4) That he shall report direct to, and receive instructions from, the variousMinisters whose departments are represented in the. Far East on matters that concern those departments.(5) That those Ministers shall authorise him to use his own judgment withregard to matters where he considers it necessary to take decisionsprior to consultation with them.(6,) That he shall assume responsibility for certain-diplomatic and politicalXL     activities hitherto performed by Commander-in-Chief, Far East, andm     Commander-in-Chief, China.I have, &amp;c.DUFF COOPER.106 Jervois Road, Singapore,October 29, 1941.
