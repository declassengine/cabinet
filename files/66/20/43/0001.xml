Return to Washington.October 29, 1941.To The Right Hon. &quot;Winston S. Churchill,P.C., C.H., M.P., Prime Minister.Report by the British Management and Labor Delegation, following their visit to the United States of America, September and October, 1941, at the invitation of the Office of Prodtiction Management.I. Objects of the Visit.THE general terms of reference conveyed to the members of the Delegationindividually in your letter of invitation provided the basis for our discussions3nd observations during the tour.II. Itinerary.The itinerary was prepared by the Office of Production Management and handed to the Delegation on their arrival in Washington. The original itinerarywas amended from time to time, in accordance with the&apos; instructions received bythe Office of Production Management Representative attached to the Delegation,during the course of the tour from Washington.Wednesday, September 17.. The Delegates, having arrived in New York in separate parties as Clipperaccommodations permitted, were informally greeted by Mayor La Guardia.Thursday, September 18.The Delegation proceeded to Washington and on arrival were received byMr. W. S. Knudsen, Mr. Sidney Hillman and the leading executives at the Office[24-94] B
of Production Management, where they were entertained for luncheon, which was followed try a Press Conference.The Delegation were entertained at tea by Sir Ronald Campbell at theBritish Embassy.Friday, Saturday and Sunday, September 19, 20, and 21.These days were devoted to the making of individual contacts between theLabor Delegates and Labor leaders and with members of the various BritishMissions in Washington.The remainder of the itinerary, indicating the firms visited, the nature oftheir products and the dates of our visit, is covered in Schedule A attached hereto.III. Impressions.A. Aircraft.Whilst deliveries of aircraft from the United States to the allies are currently being made, we gained the impression that those concerned with aircraft production were aware that the deliveries to date were disappointing, and thatthe demands of the immediate future were likely to be in excess of their ability to deliver.The Delegates were greatly impressed, not only with the vast conception,planning and execution of plants for the manufacture of aero engines and fighters, bombers and training machines, but with the way in which the best lineproduction knowledge and experience was being applied to the reproduction ofstandardized equipment.The jigging and tooling for line production flow was as impressive as the design and production of special machine tools welding and riveting equipment to provide for rapid component production and sub-assembly erection. In thisconnection, we have drawn the attention of the British authorities concerned in washington to -1. The new riveting machines seen in the new Douglas Factory at Long Beach,which machines were built by the Erco Company at Riverdale,Maryland.2. The aero engine cylinder head machines, which did all the machiningoperations to the cylinder head, as utilized by the Curtiss Wright AeroEngine Company in their new factory in Cincinnati and manufacturedby the Greenlee Tool Company, llockford, Illinois.Both these machines impressed us as being the type of machine which, ifduplicates could be quickly obtained for our own aircraft factories, would helpconsiderably in expediting delivery, reducing cost and conserving labor.B. Tanks.The production of tanks to date has perhaps been even more disappointing,having regard to the urgent need for them, than that of aircraft, but in additionto the obvious time required and the inevitable delay in the planning for produc-tion on so vast a scale, the tank output has been further delayed by the necessityfor preparing almost entirely new designs, the development of which in thiscountry was comparable probably with our own experience since the outbreakof the war.In this connection, we submit that there would seem to be a necessity forthe closest possible co-ordination and the most frequent interchange of all know-ledge and experience that may affect the nature of the armament and the typeof engine. The importance of this will be the more readily appreciated when itis realised that the greater the production program and the more vast the toolingand production, inevitably the more difficult, more slow and more costly will bethe introduction of modifications and changes of design.C. Ship Building.The same measure of experience and imagination as has been applied tothe mass production of aircraft and tanks is being applied to ship building. Itwas most encouraging to find in the shipyards on the west coast, both in san francisco and Seattle, which we were privileged to visit, that production on a scale and at a rate hitherto considered impossible was well in hand.
When the schedules are in full swing, some of these yards contemplatelaunching a cargo vessel every ten days and a destroyer every fourteen.The features which impressed us the most in this connection were 1. The general use and development of welding processes, including the automatic.2. The flow production and component assembly.3. It is hoped that we may be profiting from current American knowledge and experience, and that rigid rules, insurance requirements and the like, that have proved such a costly impediment in the past, are beingwaived at home, as here, and for all time.The Seattle Tacoma Shipyard at Seattle, with ten destroyers on the stocks,impressed us as being one of the most efficient and economic shipyard layoutsfor war production which we have seen and which might possibly be reproduced in Canada.D. Small Arms Ammunition.We were privileged to see the new Government plant managed by Remingtonin Denver, which had just started producing, and a duplicate plant in the courseof erection at New Brighton, near St. Paul, Minnesota. With the enormousproduction facilities which these and similar plants, which we understand arein the course of erection, will afford, shortages should be overcome.E. Bombs.One of the most impressive factories visited was the A. 0. Smith factory inMilwaukee, world-famed in connection with the production of automobile framesand welded steel pipes, tubes and similar products. The production in this factory of welded steel tube bombs at the rate of approximately one a minutemade us feel that it was ia pity that these were destined for the United states army, and, therefore, not likely to find the targets for which they were made as quickly as if they had been shipped to us.We recommend a study of the method of production of these bombs by those concerned in the United Kingdom and believe that the views of the President,Mr. Ray Smith, on mass production of ships are worthy of the immediateattention of those concerned with current, and more particularly post-war, shipbuilding interests in the United Kingdom, despite the fact that these proposals,if adopted, may cut seriously across existing methods.F. Internal Combustion Engines.The enormous strides being made in connection with the development ofthese products, of such basic importance to the war effort on the land, on the sea and in the air, made visits to such factories as General Motors Cleveland DieselEngine Division, the Buda Engine Company, the Nordberg Company and others of special interest, particularly when it is borne in mind that we were able to seethe &quot; in line &quot; production of diesei engines for submarines in which there wasno cast iron, and the production of radial air-cooled diesel engines for tanks(and subsequently for airplanes) and the preparation of equipment for the&quot;in line&quot; production of 1,700 H.P. (14-cylinder, twin banks of 7 cylinders) forradial aero engines at the rate of 60 per day.The necessity will be appreciated for insuring in this connection, as in allother of the war products, that no effort be spared to guarantee that, whateverproduct is being produced, it is the product that is proven, accepted and required.Failure to do this will make of no avail the existing, rapidly and enormouslyincreasing production, but will cause a wastage of material and man-power whichshould be avoided.G. Other War Products.Motor vehicles, locomotives and other products essential to the war effort which we have been privileged to see in production have convinced us of thedesirability for the closest interchange of knowledge and experience. The gasmasks being produced in the Chicago factory of Johnson and Johnson impressedus as being superior products for civilian requirements to those made in theUnited Kingdom, and yet the manufacturers seemed to know little of the. respec-tive merits of the United Kingdom and United States masks.[24-94] B 2
A. Productive Effort.In all comment, suggestion and criticism which anyone from the UnitedKingdom might make here, it must always be borne in mind that there is a vastdifference between the conditions ruling in a country at war and a country notat war.It has been disappointing to find that the wonderful production facilities available, taking them by and large, are closed down over the weekend. Wecannot help but feel that, as the growing knowledge of the seriousness and urgency of the position becomes more generally established, there will be a greater urgeand demand to make the effort one hundred per cent.The conception, planning and preparation for production is, as one would expect it would be in a country that has set new standards for the world in thisconnection, extremely admirable and encouraging. It is questionable as towhether the production planning has not been of a more long-term nature thanthe planning of the orders to utilize the facilities so planned.The only aircraft firm which claimed they were ahead of schedule had justdischarged 1,000 men, had over 125 airplanes on the ground tested awaitingpropellers, and the executives seemed uncertain as to whether their production facilities were really going to be fully utilized.If the design of the machines made by this company were obsolete or inexcess of requirements so as to justify no further future indents upon them, itwould seem a pity that their organization, personnel and material should, havingregard to the pressing need of conservation, either be wasted or left en Fair.B. Management.It is interesting to note that all the United States Government plantsvisited are operated and managed by firms of repute.It would be idle and foolish for any Britisher to comment upon the efficacyof American management. However, it&apos; has been our privilege to meet a veryrepresentative cross-section of American industrial management, and it is perhaps safe to say that, whilst we have met those managing and exercising their ability to the best because of &quot; the cause,&quot; we have met those whose primaryincentive was &quot;profit.&quot;It would seem desirable that the Administration of the United States ofAmerica should, as quickly as possible, appreciate the amazing, but neverthelesstrue, accomplishments of British political administration in this respect, wherethe &apos;&apos; vicious spiral &apos;&apos; has been, to no small extent, arrested by the generally sharedconviction that none shall profit from the sacrifice of the mass.No greater handicap to management of war production can present itself, inour judgment, than the uncertainty of continuity of demand, and it is pre-dominantly necessary, even without commitment, that there be some tacitassurance that those who produce efficiently and effectively what is requiredto-day are reasonably assured of a continuity of production flow, during the war.Whilst it would be true to say that American management are confused anddisturbed by the &quot; manoeuvres &quot; of the competing trade union movements of theAmerican Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, itwould seem that, either by legislation or otherwise, they have something to learnand to take cognizance of from the older experience of British employer organiza-tions, who meet their opposite numbers, representing labor, trade by trade, andwho can, therefore, expect and exercise that understanding, discipline and respect for contracts that is so essential to co-operative understanding and effort.C. Trade Unions.During the current and past few years, it would be no exaggeration to saythat a very large percentage of industrial disputes in the factories of the UnitedStates of America were due not to disagreement between management and labor,but to an over-keen competition for membership between the American Federationof Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the two predominatinglabor organizations in the United States of America, each enjoying roughly amembership of five million, a competition which has not only created all thatsentimental division between the respective members long associated with the human species, but created costly production dislocation.
We submit that if, at this time, either by legislation or otherwise, it were found possible, in the establishment of the great principles for which the twoorganizations in question were primarily created, to find a basis on. which the finances, the management and the direction of these great representative bodiescould be constituted more to Securities and Exchange Commission requirements,then all who are members or would be members might be convinced that theirgreat influence was to be used, as were their funds, for the betterment of the vastmass of the workers. A measure of unification and co-operation would rapidlybecome the predominating feature of their personnel, policy and functioning.It may be difficult, perhaps nigh impossible, to disassociate a trade union movement, conceived, based and operated for the benefit of the members whosupport it with their effort, their money and their minds, from the political problems confronting the country to which they belong. However, it would notbe an exaggeration to say, were these organizations unified, that there would bea greater measure of patriotic sentiment and understanding.D. Designs.During the course of our observations, there has been afforded to us ampleevidence of the necessity for insuring that if the best is to be obtained from thosefactories best equipped to deliver the goods, there must be a minimum of changesif the maximum of wastage of productive effort, labor and material is to be avoided.Whilst we realize that the exigencies of war are unbounded, we cannot helpbut believe that the continued availability or supply of essential equipment thatis good enough is to be preferred to the delayed production of equipment thatis of a later design.E. Factory Equipment.It has been our pleasure to observe that, by and large, in all the great factoriesthrough which we have been privileged to pass, the equipment, almost without exception, has been entirely new. This is evidence in itself that the shortest,the cheapest and the most efficient way to the production in the greatest volumeof those commodities essential to the effective prosecution of the war cannot beobtained by the adaptation, the retooling and re-equipping of those machineswhich the lay-mind all too fondly imagines can be quickly adapted and designed for war production.Whilst free from the war-time problems of dispersal and black-out as theUnited States production effort is, and profiting as it does from the uniqueclimatic conditions in many parts of this vast country, we believe that we have seen many machines that contribute materially to the saving of man-power, of jmaterial and of time that should be utilized without delay in our own great warproductive effort.From the point of view of aircraft, we submit that a greater concentration on production of fighter aircraft in the United Kingdom and a still greater con-centration on production of bomber aircraft in the United States of America hasmerit, if for no other reason than that the longer time required to produce bombers and the greater availability of material and labor in the United States of America,would permit bombers to be made in this country and flown from the UnitedStates of America to the United Kingdom or other centers of war.V. Possible Results of Visit of the Delegation.A. Labor Contacts.Whilst, the Delegation, as they have stated whenever occasion permitted,primarily came to the United States to &quot;Look, Listen and to Learn,&quot; wherethey have been given an opportunity, and the desire has been expressed (as it hasbeen frequently) they have addressed assemblies and have in individual conversa-tion endeavored to leave behind a message that not only indicates the nature ofthe unanimous support of our nation behind our Prime Minister, but also the urgent necessity for the maximum of productive effort on the part of the&quot;Arsenal of Democracy.&quot;The labor members of the Delegation have met in each center individual members, and in most cities collective assemblies, of either the American[24-94] b 3
Federation of Labor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, or both, and fromthe candid honesty and sincerity of their remarks, they have left, without question, a stamp upon the minds of those to whom they have spoken that it willbe difficult to erase.Whilst it would be foolish, in this great country, to assume that so few canaccomplish much with so many, it is the unanimous view of the Delegation that,if it were found possible for British Labor to give of their time and persuasion,on behalf of the friendly and co-operative administration of the United Statesof America, to the bringing about of a unanimity of thought and action by theAmerican Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations forthe &quot;common effort &quot; in this time of national emergency in the United States ofAmerica, much might be accomplished. We feel a &quot; iead &quot; from without mayaccomplish much within.B. Management Contacts.Whilst, for obvious reasons, it has been more difficult for the managementmembers of the Delegation to make that class of contact that the labor members have been privileged to make, the management members, whether they have beentalking to gatherings of the Chamber of Commerce, manufacturing associationsor individual executives, have, to the best of their ability, endeavored to convince those with whom they met that nothing short of a one hundred per cent,effort would suffice to meet and defeat the &quot; common enemy.&quot;Even allowing for the vast differences ruling in our two countries, it hasbeen disappointing to find that on the management side the will to profit fromthe circumstances, the desire to lay the blame for the problems of the day at thefeet of the Federal Administration, and the lack of desire to co-operate the one with the other to establish once and for all time an understanding and a mutual confidence with those who, if not as partners, are as essential to the contribution of the net results as management itself, is something that requires an early,sensible and clearly defined educational effort.VI. Suggestions for Consideration.A. Pooling of Knoivledge.The experience accruing to the active users of war equipment in the war effort must, of necessity, be quickly conveyed to the &quot; arsenals &quot; producing this equipment. How, then, it well might be asked, should there be any doubt as tothe wisdom or otherwise of using a radial air-cooled engine operating on highoctane gas or petrol as the power unit in a tank? It is beyond the function orability of the members of this Delegation to express an opinion, but when doubtsare expressed to them by the leaders of the industry of which the party fittingsuch an engine are members, one wonders whether all that is known is being fullyutilized.Whilst doubtless good reasons exist, we nevertheless wonder whether the reduced productive effort and apparent uncertainty as to continuity of demand,as observed in one factory making training machines, may not have the effect ofcausing a wastage of material and productive effort; and similarly the lack of knowledge as to the respective merits of the United Kingdom and United Statesgas masks raises the question as to whether the arrangements for complete inter-change of technical knowledge, data and experience are as efficient as theyshould be.B. Standardization of Designs.Standardization of designs, it may well be said, would represent in war timethe apotheosis of desire, but if the maximum benefits are to accrue from thegreatest and most efficient methods of production, and if the wastage of produc-tive effort and of scarce and costly materials is to be avoided, surely no secret,no inhibitions, no national, vested or biased interest shall be permitted to preventthe maximum of production for the benefit of the largest number.C. Propaganda.A few weeks is little enough to enable a Delegation to glean either themeasure of or the resultant effect of British propaganda in the United States
of America, but whilst we may, individually and collectively, have an answer to the question &quot; Where is Hess, and was his visit to Britain purely british propaganda? &quot; there would seem no reason, in our judgment, why photographsof Hess in Scotland, if need be surrounded by men in kilts, should not have beentaken and published in the United States of America. Mere evidence of hismenu hardly, in our judgment, suffices.We have organizations in this country, whose business it is to circulatenews and to distribute propaganda but without any knowledge of what the prussian organization is in this respect, and despite the fact that during ourpresence here their news has been the predominating news, we are impressed with the efficacy in which they secure its distribution.We have heard with regret of Fifth Columnist rumors, particularly thosehaving reference to the possibility of Great Britain making a separate peace and the British abuses of Lease-Lend materials, and if such factual information could be published as would prove the falsity of these rumors, our interests,we believe, would be the better served.The amazing interest in and the consummate ignorance of the large masses, Iboth of management and labor, regarding the British effort and sacrifices, jconvinces us that if a similar United States Delegation were invited by the Prime 1Minister through the President to visit our country, with the knowledge which (we have of how such a party should and can be handled, much good and more /enlightenment would result. This point was raised by the President whilsttalking to the Delegation.D. Films.Without any intimate knowledge of the arrangements for the release anddistribution of our war-time films, it has been extremely interesting to us to note that, whilst the Stars and Stripes are freely displayed in the Government-owned and paid-for factories of this country which we have visited, with but one exception (the United States Naval Arsenal at Detroit, operated by theHudson Motor Car Company) none have seen such illuminating and convincingfilms as &quot; Target for To-night.&quot; If the benefits that accrue and the interestin the  &apos; Common Cause &apos;&apos; be aided by the showing in the United States NavalArsenal above referred to of the Oerlikon Gun in use by His Majestj^s Navy,then, indeed, it would seem worth while arranging, whatever the existing treatiesor trade arrangements may permit, that at least those from whom so much is sought and expected in the armament factories of America should be taughtand enlightened by a more close and detailed intimation of the benefits of their service and the products to which they contribute, by the use of suitable films.E. Post-War Aims.Often have we been asked, &quot; What and where will Britain be will sheadopt some form of &apos; ism &apos; when this war is over ? &quot; Individually and collectively,we have not hesitated, with all the determination of our convictions, to reply that with the coming of peace Britain will be found still cherishing the Motherof Parliaments, freedom of speech, and all those basic principles for whichDemocracy stands, and that whatever party may be in power, be it old or new,the basic principles upon which the British Empire has been established will still be maintained and cherished by the people of our country.If it were found possible to create a small United States-United KingdomCommittee under a United States Chairman, to prepare a carefully conceivedplan for the financial, economic and commercial rehabilitation of the world; greatreassurance to many in doubt would be afforded.The details of such a plan could well be withheld until the psychologicalmoment arises for their announcement, but the advice of its broad principles,embodying as they must solutions not only to the problems created by the war,but to those basic problems that have burdened mankind for too long will, webelieve, have beneficial repercussions of a far-reaching nature.F. Factory Constrtictions.The amazing speed and efficiency with which many of the plants which wehave visited have been constructed in an astonishingly short space of time, manyof them on land which was either agricultural or swamp six or twelve months
prior to the date of our visit, affords proof of the desirability for the closeststudy by the United Kingdom of the enormous use made by contractors of specialised mechanical equipment of all types and kinds.G. Housing.Whilst it has been interesting to note the vast housing developments whichare taking place in conjunction with the construction of new war factories, theproblems and conditions in this connection, as in connection with the problemof transportation of work people, are so different to those existing in the UnitedKingdom that further comment would seem unnecessary.H. Incentives.Whilst various forms of payment by results, incentive bonuses, &amp;e, havebeen tried in the United States as in the United Kingdom, it is interesting to observe that the plant in which the greatest individual effort seemed apparentwas in the Naval Arsenal near St. Paul, Minnesota, in which attractive formsof incentive in the way of Government Defense Bonds were being offered weekly.VII. Return to Washington.On their return to Washington, the Delegation had interviews withMr. Knudsen&quot;and Mr. Hillman, which interviews were followed by a press conference at the Office of Production Management.After luncheon at the British Embassy with Lord Halifax, the delegation were received by Vice-President Wallace.On Wednesday, the 22nd October, they were received by President Roosevelt.From these interviews and contacts in Washington, we were encouraged tobelieve that the results accruing from our tour were regarded by our hosts aseminently satisfactory.The Delegation wish to place on record their thanks and appreciation for thegreat assistance and courtesy extended to them by the Officials of the Office ofProduction Management, who were responsible for the preparation and executionof the trip, particularly Mr. Paul A. Porter, who, in his capacity as Senior Officeof Production Management Official, contributed greatly to the success of the trip,as well as to the War Department for so kindly placing an Army Transport Planeat the disposal of the Delegation.In conveying our thanks and appreciation to you, Mr. Prime Minister, forthe opportunity which you have afforded us by appointing us as members of thisDelegation, we wish to record that if any Government Departments or individual industries should desire any further information in connection with the points raised in this report, which it is within our power to give, w^e shall, of course,be only too glad to do so.We have the honor to be,Your obedient servants,GEORGE ISAACS..  &quot; JAMES KAYLOR.ALLAN A.

Defense Production Effort.November 3, 1941.To The Right Hon. Winston S. Churchill,P.C., OH., M.P., Prime Minister.Report by the British Management and Labor Delegation on their visit to inspectthe defense production activity in the Dominion of Canada.I. Objects of the Visit.THE Hon. C. D. Howe, Minister of Munitions and Supply, on behalf of theDominion Government, extended an invitation, which was conveyed through theusual diplomatic channels, to the above Delegation, whilst they were in Chicago,to pay a visit to a cross-section of the Canadian defense industries, after thetermination of their tour in the United States of America.II. Itinerary.Toronto, October 27th.The Delegation left New York on Sunday, the 26th October, and were met inToronto on Monday morning, the 27th, by Mr. Frank M. Ross, Mr. J. Crone,Mr. Howard Chase and Mr. Bryson.Canadian Acme Screw and Gear. Shortly after their arrival in Torontothe Delegation were taken to the works of the Canadian Acme Screw and GearCompany, which were producing fuses and gears on an efficient basis.John Inglis Company. The Delegation then went to the John Inglis Com-pany, where there was a very considerable production on well-planned lines of marine boilers and engines, Boys anti-tank rifles, Bren machine guns and Colt-Browning aircraft machine guns.The Delegates took luncheon in the factory cafeteria with the Directors ofthe John Inglis Company.Research Enterprises, Limited. In the afternoon, they visited ResearchEnterprises, Limited, at Leaside, Ontario, a Government-subsidized factoryworking on a wide range of highly-specialized products, such as optical glass,scientific instruments, secret radio devices, and the like.Small Electric Motors, Limited.-Thej also paid a visit to the neighbouringplant of Small Electric Motors, Limited, who are specializing on the productionof especially designed motors for the Services.[24-95]
2Hamilton. The Party then motored, to Hamilton, where they wereentertained at dinner by the Mayor and leading industrialists of that City, atwhich members of the Delegation spoke.Tuesday, October 28th.Otis-Fensom Elevator Co. At 9-30 a.m. on Tuesday morning, the Delegationvisited the Otis-Fensom Elevator Company, who, both in their own shops and in the Government-subsidized shops, were actively and impressivelyengaged in the manufacture of 40-MM. Bofors anti-aircraft guns and barrels.Dominion Foundries and Steel, Limited. At 11 -15 a.m. a visit was paidto the factory of the Dominion Foundries and Steel, Limited, where was seen the production of Armour Plate, 3-7 anti-aircraft barrel forgings, merchantplate, tin plate and steel castings, on a very impressive scale.Canadian Westinghouse, Limited. After taking luncheon with the Directorsin the Staff Cafeteria, the Delegation then visited Canadian Westinghouse,Limited, where both in their own shops and in the adjoining Government-subsidized factory the manufacture of 3-7 gun barrels was being carriedon in impressive quantities, but which quantities will be considerably increased as the new plant gets under way.Dundas.John Bertram and Sons, Limited. The Delegation then left for Dundas,where a visit was paid to the factory of John Bertram and Sons, Limited, whosewell-equipped plant was producing a wide range of machine tools, both of theirown design and of other American and British machine-tool manufacturers underlicense.Hamilton. In the evening, the party were entertained at dinner at theHamilton Club, at which the Directors of the firms visited and others werepresent.Montreal. On Tuesday evening, the party left Hamilton by train forMontreal, arriving in that City on Wednesday morning, the 29th.October 2$th.Dominion Engineering Works, Plant No. 1.--At 9-45 aim. the Delegationvisited the Number 1 Plant of the Dominion Engineering Works at Lachine (nearMontreal), where a wide range of naval and military engineering work was beingexecuted, and the manufacture of diesel engines for His Majesty&apos;s Navy and mercantile Marine was noted with interest.Robert Mitchell Company, Limited. At 11-30 a.m. the Robert MitchellCompany&apos;s plant was visited, where the production of 25 pdr. and 2 pdr. shellcasings on up-to-date lines was being carried out in an extremely encouragingway. All were impressed with the speed and energy with which&quot; all in this factoryappeared to be working. It was interesting to note that approximately seventy-five per cent, of the employees were French Canadians.The Delegation were entertained at luncheon at the St. James Club by the directors of the Dominion Engineering Company, at which luncheon some of the delegates spoke.Dominion Engineering Works, Plant No. 2. After luncheon, the partyvisited the Dominion Engineering Plant No. 2 at Longueuil (near Montreal), atwhich 2 pdr. anti-tank guns. 6 pdr. anti-tank guns and 2-7 Mark VII NavalMountings were being made in a most impressive manner.October 30thFairchild Aircraft, Limited. On Thursday, the party left Montreal forSorel by road, and en route stopped to inspect the Fairchild Aircraft, Limited,Longueuil (near Montreal), in which the production of Bolingbroke bomber aircraft was being carried out, if not on as spacious a scale as we had observed in the American aircraft plants, at least as expeditiously. Here again, theevidence of the will and desire to co-operate and give of their best by the FrenchCanadian workers was noticed, over ninety per cent, of the workers in this factory being of French Canadian extraction.Sorel.Sorel Industries. Our visit to the Sorel Industries was divided into two sections.
sIn the morning we visited the shipyards, where the production of corvettes,minesweepers and naval and mercantile ships was being executed on a surprisinglyintensive scale. The preparation of the new railway launching dock to greatlyfacilitate the launching or repairing of ships on a much larger scale was wellin hand, and it was contemplated this would be in full operation before the endof the year.The Delegation were entertained to luncheon by the Directors of SorelIndustries, at which Mr. Joe Simard, the eldest of the three French Canadianbrothers, spoke, and to which Delegates suitably replied.After luncheon, the Delegation were taken to the Sorel Industries GunFactories, at which were being produced 25-pdr. equipment (guns and carriages),4-inch Mark 19 Naval Guns and 4-inch Mark 5 Naval Guns. The size and equip-ment of these factories favourably impressed the Delegation.Indeed, it seems only fair to record that the enterprises of the SimardBrothers, who for two years prior to the outbreak of war embarked on the building and equipment of this enormous plant, visualizing as they did the importance andnecessity of going in for production of such essential war equipment in Canada,in our opinion not only displayed great initiative and courage, but has rendereda more valued service to the Empire cause than would otherwise have beenpossible.In the gun plant, the manufacture of finished guns and carriages, from thesmelting of the ore, takes place in factories and under working conditions thatleave nothing to be desired.The Delegation returned to the Hotel Windsor, and it being the last eveningin which they would all be able to assemble, they entertained to dinner theirCanadian Government friends and associates aforementioned, and a suitablestatement was issued through the Publicity Director of the Department ofMunitions and Supply for Dominion-wide distribution, briefly summarizing the impressions gained by the Delegation.III. Impressions.After seeing the enormous factories and defense plants in the United Statesof America, either in operation or in the course of construction, the delegation were not only agreeably surprised, but greatly encouraged in finding that thedefense production program which they had an opportunity of inspecting,coupled with the inspection of the statistics and data made available to themcovering the Dominion-wide defense production effort convinces them that theDominion&apos;s effort in this direction is worthy of the highest praise and certainlyis far greater than is realized by the average Canadian or British citizen.Those with a knowledge of the pre-war engineering activity in the Dominion,coupled with a knowledge of the enormous difficulty confronting a country so large and with such a small domestic demand, will appreciate the more thedifficulties which have had to be overcome and the efforts that have had to bemade to reach that stage of defense production now attained in Canada.From our observations, we would like particularly to record what animportant part and extremely successful part has been played by the UnitedKingdom Representative, Mr. J. Crone, who has not only given the benefit ofhis specialized technical experience, but has won, in a most remarkable way, theconfidence and enthusiastic support of all those industrialists with whom he hascome into contact and we understand there are few, if any, whom he has not met, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, in the Dominion.A. Factory Publicity.We were much attracted by the extremely impressive posters which were much in evidence in the various factories visited, and we suggest that an exchangeof posters between the various Empire countries, and possibly the United Statesof America, would not only be of interest, but the source of added inspiration,and many of the designs might be found capable of reproduction in other empire countries.B. Research Production.Whilst we are not in a position to indicate in what other markets overseaswork such as that being carried out by the Research Enterprises, Limited, is
being duplicated, our visit to this plant forcibly brought before us theimportance of insuring that key industries of this type were situated to provide an adequate production away from bombing risks.The effect on the post-war United Kingdom export trade to the dominion of the enormous stimulation that the war has of necessity given to the secondaryindustrial activity of the Dominion makes it desirable, in the opinion of the delegation, that a study of the post-war problems resulting from this and likecauses should receive the early consideration of those best able to study same.C. Inter-Exchange of Visits.Whilst, of course, it is appreciated that there is frequent personal contactby Ministerial Officials and technical officers between Ottawa, Washington and london, we believe that if a more frequent exchange could be arranged betweenthe senior technical and production officers of the various plants on war workof a like nature, as between the United States of America. Canada and possibly the United Kingdom, beneficial results would accrue by the greater exchange of knowledge, experience and practice which would be made available in such a wayto the largest possible number concerned.D. Films.The closest co-operation of the Services in assisting in the production offilms of interest to the war workers in the industries on this continent and possibly in other Empire countries would, we are convinced, have the effect of stimulating the individual manual, mental and financial effort.E. Defense Production Effort.Whilst during our stay in Canada we have only been able to cover a smallsection of the country, we believe that neither on the grounds of time nor expensewould a more extensive tour, at this juncture, be justifiable. FrOm ourobservations and the data made available to us, we can only speak in the highestterms of the efforts being made by those in the industries and by those whosebusiness it is to organize and maintain the industries on their war effort.In the opinion of the Delegation, it is regrettable that the impressive effort,to which reference is made in the aforegoing, is not more widely appreciated.We would like to place on record our thanks and appreciation for the valuable assistance that was extended to us by those representing the Ministryof Munitions and Supply, particularly Mr. Frank M. Ross, Mr. Howard Chase,Mr. J. Crone and Mr. Bryson, who so materially contributed to the success ofthe tour.We have the honor to be,Your obedient Servants,F. C. BRABY.PERCY LISTER.J. STANLEIGH TURNER.ALLAN A. H. FINDLAY.JAMES KAYLOR.GEORGE ISAACS.WILL LAWTHER.C. K. F. HAGUE.
