(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).SECRET. t .W. P.(42)17. 1 COPY NO.   r*]9 th January., 1942. \&apos; - WAR   CABINET.&apos;(j FREEZING OF PART-TIME VOLUNTEERS IN THECIVIL DEFENCE SERVICES.-    -Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister ofHome Security, the Minister of Health   and the Secretaryof State for Scotland. &apos;.1*   The Home Policy Committee on 6th January approved a.draft Orderin Council amending&apos; Defence Regulation 29B: in order to enable part-time civil defence volunteers to be &quot;frozen&quot; in their present:services;. The approval was given on the understanding that theprocedure for hearing appeals should be settled by the ministers concerned in consultation with the Ministry of Labour and NationalService.2.    A meeting took place between the Ministers concerned at whichalternative methods&quot;were considered,- the first proposed by theMinister of Labour and National Service and the second by theMinisters responsible for the maintenance of. the civil defence organisation of the country. T    . &apos;-5.    The two&apos;procedures have this common feature:    The individual member who is to be &quot;frozen&quot; will&quot;, at all&apos; times &apos;have an opportunity -of tendering his resignation to the appropriate-civil; defenceauthority and explaining the grounds of hardship upon, which hedesires to be released.    If these grounds are deemed sufficient andhis services can be dispensed with without seriously jeopardisingthe efficiency of the organisation of which he is a member, the resignation will be accepted without further&apos; ado.4.     A difference of view emerges at the point at which the civil defence authority declines to grant release. &apos; The reason may bethat the individual hardship alleged is not sufficiently convincingor (exceptionally) that the establishment is seriously undermannedand the Authority cannot afford to part with any of its membersuntil the Minister of Labour and National Service has provided a substitute volunteer, who may require a period of training, or hasdirected some other person under&apos;Defence Regulation 29BA to trainand take the place of the man who wishes to resign.5.    On the industrial analogy the Minister of Labour and NationalService is of opinion that, as the average part-time civil defence%worker is for the greater part of his time an industrial workert heshould have the same opportunity of access to che HardshipTribunals in this matter as ho has in other forms of compulsion formilitary service, for industrial employment, or in respect of a direction under Defence Regulation 29BA to undertake for the first time Civil Defence obligations-    Whether the Hardship tribunal should make its recommendation to the Minister of Labour and NationsService or to the Minister responsible for the particular branch ofthe Civil Defence organisation is not a matter of controversy.6*    The Ministers responsible for civil defence do not regard the
issue whether the private citizen should be directed to join thecivil defence services (or enter war industry) as being in.the samecategory as the question whether a voluntarily enrolled member of a[service on a war footing- should be allowed to leave it in time of   &quot;Jwar.    It would in their view be as inappropriate that a civil defence volunteer should appeal to an outside body against a decision not to release him reached by those responsible for the service, asit would be for a member of the Armed Forces of the Crown to begiven access to civilian tribunals for the purpose of securing hisdischarge.    In the parallel case of the Home Guard,, once the openperiod fdr resignations has expired, the release ,of individual members will be at the discretion of the military authority.    Apart Ifrom that, hardship tribunals, with their industrial background and limited role of adjudicating upon individual circumstances, do not seem to be appropriate for the particular purpose in view.    On theother hand the Ministers responsible for civil defence do not feelthat the alternative set out below which.they are willing to. accept,will have industrial repercussions, or embarrass the Minister of.Labour and National Service in his dealings with these volunteers,or others associated with them, in their main capacity as x-^ersonsgainfully occupied in industrial employment.7.    The whole-time personnel in the Civil Defence Services were&quot;frozen&quot; without consultation and have only such right of appeal for release as derives from the power reserved to the Ministers .    . jmaking the Freezing Orders to dispense with the services of individuals.    This power can be-exercised by the Minister, althoughthe officer appointed by the authority.to be in charge of theservice may have declined to release the applicant.    The procedurehas worked satisfactorily, notwithstanding that loss of opportunity I;to take up better-paid employment resulting.from the freezing of whole-time personnel must have created far greater personalhardship than any likely to arise from freezing part-time personnel.The latter will still follow their normal livelihood and, indeed,may be directed into other and better paid employment while stillremaining part-time volunteers frozen in civil.defence.8.   Local authorities-are accustomed by long usage to appeals beingmade to Ministers against their actions in individual cases of appointment or dismissal.&quot;   They are not^ however, accustomed tojustify to local Hardship Tribunals that the.needs of their GivilDefence organisation are such that in the national interest thesemust override, . perhaps only temporarily, the hardship to theindividual who is required to remain in his post.    With a view to meeting the objections of the Minister of Labour and NationalService to Ministers being judges in their own cause, the Ministers fconcerned are - prepared to agree that the right of appeal against the refusal of the appropriate civil defence authority to grant leave to resign should lie to the Regional Commissioner, except in thePolice Service and in Scotland, where different considerations applyjand,the appeal should lie to the Secretary of State.    The Regional\.Commissioner represents the machinery of Government as a whole and^not the interests of any particular Department of State.    He would naturally consult v/ith the Regional Controller of the Ministry ofLabour and National Service in cases in which industrial issues were!raised.9.    It should be noted that a strong esprit de corps and servicetradition have grown up in Civil Defence.  ,It is felt that part-time -members would neither appreciate, nor desire to see introduced^
machinery,for terminating their employment which differed fromthat applicable to their paid colleagues in the same service.    if that machinery is unexpectedly found to work unsatisfactorily asa result of the new use to which it is to be put, it could be quickly altered in the sense proposed by the Minister of Labourand National Service.    The Ministers submit that it should beallowed to have a trial.10.    &amp;s the present difficulties, have arisen because of thefortnight&apos;s delay proposed to be given to members of the home guard before &quot;freezing&quot; takes effect in their case, considerationhas again been given to the possibility of allowing a similarperiod of grace for part-time Civil Defence volunteers anddispensing, as in the Home Guard, with any external machinery for .dealing with applications to resign.11.   No one can determine what numbers of part-time volunteers arelikely to leave civil defence if an open period is permitted.    Itis fair to assume, however, that resignations on a large scalewithin the next fortnight or so would create even greaterembarrassment to the Civil Defence Services than to the Home Guard.Provisional freezing must therefore come into force at once.    If,however, the Minister of Labour and National Service could undertaketo re-direct back into their respective Civil Defence functions anypart-time volunteers who resigned, whose return was desired by thecivil defence authorities, and could arrange that any appeals onhardship grounds against directions to return were disposed of byhis Tribunals within a fortnight, we should be prepared for our part to accept an arrangement under which resignations tendered within a fortnight after the announcement of freezing would be accepted atthe expiry of a fortnight.    If the number of appeals allowed by the tribunals were substantial in any area it would of course benecessary for directions under Defence Regulation 29BA to be givento a corresponding number of persons who had hitherto notundertaken obligations to civil defence.It would be understood that at the end of the period of provisional freezing the part-time volunteer who remained in thecivil defence service would be in the same position as regardsresignation as a whole-time member or a member of the Home Guard.That is to say, release in all cases would be at the discretion ofthe civil defence authorities or the Minister concerned.    Thiswould have to be made clear at the time the decision to freezepart-time volunteers is made public.12.    To summarise(i)    the Ministers greatly prefer that there should be no right of access to hardship tribunals but that thedecision whether part-time members of the civil defence services should be allowed to resign should be dealtwith in the same manner as applications for leave to resign made by whole-time members of the services.. (ii) if the Cabinet are unable to agree  bo this, the ministers responsible for civil defence are prepared to agreethat an unconditional opportunity to resign, within ashort period of a public announcement, should be- givento all part-time civil defence volunteers.Resignations should not, however, be allowed to take
effect for a fortnight.   Within that period the Minister ofLabour and National Service, under Defence Regulation 29BA,would direct, preferably the volunteers who resign, or alternatively a corresponding number of suitable persons tojoin the services on a part-time basis.H.M.E.B.T.
