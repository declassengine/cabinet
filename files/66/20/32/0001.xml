Memorandum by Minister of War Transport.in W.P.  (hi) 308 the First Lord of the Admiralty asks that8 suitable merchant ships should be converted to AuxiliaryAircraft CarrierSo I naturally feel the greatest sympathy with any steps taken to improve the defence of merchant shipping.Nevertheless, I feel bound to point out to the War Cabinet thestringency of our present shipping position.The target programme for imports into the United kingdom in 1942 is 33 million tons.    Before the outbreak of war in theFar East, we expected to be able to lift 29 million tons in ships under our control, including assistance from the United  states on the scale we have enjoyed in recent months.    The achievement of this target, therefore, involves additional assistance fromthe United States to the extent of U million tons of imports.Since those estimates were prepared the spread of war to the pacific has imposed a greater strain on our own shipping resources and has greatly increased the United States need forher own tonnage;    demands for shipment to Russia have also increased.The general import prospects are, therefore, much less favourable than they were a month ago.j but the Admiralty requestcannot only be considered in relation to the general prospects for the type of ship required is exactly that of which we havethe greatest need.    Our greatest shortages are of fast ships for trooping, for carrying equipment with troops in militaryconvoys^ and refrigerated ships for carrying meat.On present indications it will be necessary to reduce the meat ration throughout 19^2 by an average.ge of 2jd.  and throughout19k3 to an even greater extent.It will be seen that we can very ill afford to spare theships for which the First Lord is askingsIf, notwithstanding it be decided that it is  essentialthat these vessels should be taken and converted to AuxiliaryAircraft Carriers, I must ask that there should be an immediate,adjustment between naval and merchant shipbuilding construction in favour of the latter,  in such a way as will make up so farand as rapidly as possible the loss of carrying power. ways and means would obviously have to be discussed between the two departments, but it is clear that there will be an inevitableloss to merchant ship output if 8 fast vessels, already in an advanced stage of construction, are permanently diverted.Ministry of War Transport.1st January^ 19U2a
