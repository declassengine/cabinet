THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   December 1941.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (41) 296.December 2, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.1I AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.FAR EASTERN POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Presidents attitude, as shown in Washington telegram No. 5519, is forthcoming and helpful and it is important that we should respond withoutdelay. I have already telegraphed asking Lord Halifax to ascertain whetherthe President would prefer that his enquiry to the Japanese should be madeby the United States Government alone or whether it would be agreeable to him that we should make a simultaneous enquiry. If the latter,- Sir R. Craigie willbe instructed at once and it will be desirable that the Netherlands Governmentshould take corresponding action. The President accepts as axiomatic that, inthe event of a direct attack by Japan on ourselves or on the Dutch, the UnitedStates, the Dutch and ourselves would be all together. I would urge, therefore,?that we should now lose no time in removing the awkwardness which at present^exists in our relations with the Dutch owing to our reluctance to promise fulland unhesitating support to them if the Netherlands East Indies are attacked.I feel strongly that there should be no further equivocation on this point andthat we should inform President Roosevelt of our attitude.2. To turn to Thailand, the Presidents promise of support in the event ofour undertaking an operation in the Kra Isthmus will, I hope, enable mycolleagues to decide to carry out that operation at the appropriate moment.I will return later to the action which ought to be taken vis-a-vis of Thailandto pave the way for that operation when it is decided on.3. The more immediate question is the reply which we shall send to president roosevelt&apos;s enquiry as to what action we shall take in the threehypotheses put forward in paragraph 6 of Washington telegram No. 5519. Thefirst two of these hypotheses seem to me to be in fact one. All our information is to the effect that reinforcements have been arriving for some time and arestill continuing. The. only point therefore is whether the Japanese reply to president roosevelt&apos;s enquiry is satisfactory or not. If it is not, then I would suggest that the proper reaction would be simultaneous warnings to Japan bythe United States, the Dutch and ourselves that further aggressive action on her part will be taken at her own peril.4. As regards the third hypothesis, namely, a Japanese attack on Thailandother than an attack on the Kra Isthmus, our own reply would presumably bethe occupation of the southern portion of the Kra Isthmus.11571   [23218]
5. To turn back to Thailand^ the President makes the same suggestion asthe New Zealand Government have, already done, that we should try to obtain from the Thai Government an invitation to defend the Kra Isthmus. It is unlikely that any useful purpose would be served by such an attempt unless a warning has previously been given to Japan by the United States and ourselves.Even in that event, the approach might easily produce the wrong result so long-as we are not in a position to offer Thailand direct military assistance in theprotection of the rest of their territory other than the Kra. We should, ineffect, be asking the Thai Government to adopt the heroic course of partialextinction in order to ensure their ultimate independence.6. It would no doubt suit us well, if the Thai Government decided to resistJapan and were compelled to abandon Bangkok, that they should transferthemselves to British territory while their troops retired southwards to link up with our own with the object of denying the whole of the Kra Isthmus to theJapanese and destroying communications to the north of the Isthmus. But, forthe reasons stated above, sucrr an arrangement would appear to have littleattraction for the Thai Government.7. For the moment, it doesmot appear possible to do more than to acquaintSir J. Crosby with the possibility of the Kra operation and ask for his views asto the best method of ensuring that the Thai Government will not resist us andwill, if possible, give us their active assistance.A.
