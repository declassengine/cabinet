SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL EXPENDITURE-,I,Memorandum addressed to the Prime Minister for theconsideration of the War Cabinet on 20th August, 1941cI,    Mary complaints about the production and unusualdesign c ? the Albemarle aircraft have reached the SelectCommittee from various sources, including men actually engagedin its manufacture.      These complaints related principally toprolonged delays, mismanagement a nd waste,2.    So far as the Select Committee can determine, theamount of money and time already spent greatly exceeds anycorresponding expenditure to the same stage of development forother types of aircraft, whether ultimately successful orunsuccessful,      The materials used for the airframe  - wood andsteel tubes as opposed to fabricated light alloys -- are notthose in current use for aircraft designed to meet  theconditions of modern warfare^      The Select Committee are notauthorised to consider the operational needs of the Royal Air-Force, nor are the reasons of policy; which lea to thisdeparture from present practice; within their scope,      But itis their &quot;duty,  under the terms of reference laid upon them bythe House of Commons, to inquire into war expenditure..3.    In order to assess the value which the country isobtaining for its money,  it is obvious that the background ofpolicy and operational need must be taken into account in tLu.formulation of a judgment upon cost,      The Sub-Committee on air Services, therefore, took evidence from official witnessesrepresenting production and design, and from the firm entrusted with the manufacture of this  aircraft, whose works theyvisited.      The Air Ministry,  however,  were not prepared -co offer a statement on operational needs and,  therefore,  the Sub-Committee have no complete picture before them.4.    As a result of their inquiries the Sub-Committee came to the decision that the project should be abandoned and thatthis was a matter which called for an urgent report to theHouse of Commons.      A report was drafted by them and lair!before the Select Committee with the intention that it shouldbe presented to the House in the normal manner,      following the Select Committee&apos;s usual practice, the draft was subjected to the closest scrutiny on grounds  .-x security; and theopinion of the Ministry was asked for on those passages(concerned strictly with facts given in evidence,  as opposed tothe Sub-Committee&apos;s conclusions)   the publication of whichmight in any way convey information of value to the eneny.5.    The reply received indicated that the enemy iscertainly aware that this aircraft is being developed, but thatany public revelation of the state of the progress of its development and production would be of &quot;very substantial assistance&quot; to him.      The Select Commit tee were already seized,of this possibility,  although they doubt the strength of theDepartment&apos;s contention.      They are convinced, however-; thatthe facts of the case are such as should be brought in fall tothe attention of the House of Commons and that they would beheld to be failing in their duty to the House if they did notat some time do so.      Were they now to follow the course of immediate presentation the procedure of the House - ... matter

which is completely outside the control of the Select Committeewould automatically entail full publication to the world.They have, therefore, resolved,  as the result of a narrowdivision&apos;;  to proceed at the present time under the special powers,  conferred hy the House upon the Co-ordinating Sub-Committee,  of addressing a memorandum to the Prime Minister forthe consideration of the War Cabinet,THE HISTORY&quot; OP IhE ALH3M. J?L.h6.      The Co-ordinating Sub-Committee are aware that  thehistory of this case must be well known to the War Cabinet,but they here briefly recapitulate the facts elicited inevidence by the Sub-Committee on Air Services as a necessarybackground to their conclusions-^( a)   .5:5.aspns for the original ^decision,70      The Sub-Committee could not establish whether theidea of a wood and stool bomber originated, with the Air ministry or with the industry, but the first proposal was made by a formof designers in February 2938,      At that time the&apos; Ministry were faced with the necessity for the rapid expansion of the AirForce and the reasons which weighed with them in adopting this s c lie me were; -(i)    That the supplies of aluminium might become limitedas maximum production was approached,( ii)    That the essential plant for the fabrication of lightalloys was definitely in short supply.;    and as the supplies offabricated aluminium come.forward they are required for expanding the production of existing metal types.(iii)    That,  owing to the change over to light alloyconstruction, many firms which built aeroplanes in the last war would not be building them now, and that there would thereforebe a large volume of wood working facilities and labour whichmight he utilised in the national effort.( iv)    That the existence of these aircraft would form anadditional reserve,  and that the capacity to build them might beof vital importance if existing aluminium supplies were at anytime cut off or the capacity to fabricate alloys  &quot;^&quot;&quot;^Ivrestrict ed0( v)    That  the scheme would not interfere with other aircraft production, nor compete in the priority field,8,,      It was part of the scheme that a great quantity ofthe work should be sub-contracted in order to bring within thescope of aircraft production many small firms and much labour which would not otherwise be used.      It was stated that therewas&apos; a general desire for the construction of this machine,  andit was suggested that not only the Air Council and all the woodworking industries, but various public men advocated the making of greater use of these existing facilities.      The policy of theAir Ministry was,   first,   to have aid  ^ a 3; rang machinosconstructed in wood and, secondly,  to have available a bombermainly of timber and steel tubes.,9o It is argued that repairs are more easily effected in a wooden machine, and that the quantity of steel required is relatively small, but most of the wood has to be imported from Canada,      It is admitted by those competent to know that

a wooden aeroplane, more especially a wooden bomber, is not soefficient either in speed, or load-carrying capacity as a metalmachine.      A light alloy structure superseded wood because it provided better aircraft.      This fact is fundamental to a consideration of the problem.      The evidence regarding similarexperiments in ether countries was that the French had triedreversion to wood; but in a small v/ay and not very successfully;Capronis had built a typo with eve a more wood than the JLlbemarlejthe Germ ins .had apparently   ;one nothing so fa:.-;    nor had theU,S.A., hut tho;/ were looking on at our experiments withinterests      In addition to the Albemarle, another woodenmachine - the Mosquito, a fight-er - is now being built.(b)    The technical -problem,,I0o      Serious concern over the shortage of light alloys set the problem of seeing what could he done with wood and steeltubes,  and whether the aircraft which might be built, usingthese materials, would he technically so Inferior that it wouldnot he worth building -- in spite of the other considerations set out above,      When they decided to proceed with this development, the Ministry never imagined that a first classaeroplane would be produced,      Among other disadvantages therewould always he the penalty of weight.II,.      The procedure in developing- a new aircraft underpeace conditions, the form having been settled in earlydiscussions on the firm?s proposal, was first to hold aconference on a full scale &quot;mock-up&quot; of the aircraft in wood.When this was approved and the various technical featuresagreed, the firm proceeded to the construction of one or twoprototypes,      These    were then tested, and their operationalqualities assessed by the user,.      Upon t.iese tests a decision was made;    and, if they were favourable, preparations for production were begun,12,      This lengthy process could not be followed in wartime.      Since the expansion policy was put into force,  theMinistry have consistently ordered practically &quot;off the drawingboard&quot;;    that is to say, preparations for production have been   vmade before the prototype has been completed or te:-;ted0      Thisaccelerated procedure rests on the assumption that technicalcapacity and knowledge of aeroplane construction are adequate,and of necessity involves financial risks, since components areimmediately ordered and the contractors start their tooling and manufacturing processes at once.      It is claimed that theexperience of the last two or three years has justified theprocedure.13.      In this case,  one of the biggest difficulties, amongmany encountered; was that the weight was underestimated by thedesigner and the wing area had to be increased.      It is claimed,however,  that the present design will he good for short-rangebombing hut that its primary use will he for reconnaissance,It has a most complete equipment for this ijurpose-      The nearestmetal type of aircraft is the Wellington bomber,      In comparisonwith this,  the Alhemarle has approximately the seme bomb-loadcapacity, hut owing to its greater weight has not the samerange and is not intended for the same purposes,      In fact,  itcannot apparently be used as an alternative to the Wellingtonexcept possibly for short range bombing.

( c)    The date sequence.14,      The programme of design and production may &quot;brieflybe set out as follows:-February 1938May - June 19 3818 August 1938September 1938September 1938March 194013 November 193930 January 1940March - September1940June194028 September 194015 November 19404 February 19414 May 1941June 19411 August 1941First proposal made..Discussions between hhe Ministry andthe firm,Contract with Armstrong-Whitworth for two prototypes.Conference on the &quot;rnock-up&quot;.Design and construction of prototype.Contract with Gloster Aircraft for198 aeroplanes.Second contract with Gloster aircraft for 800 aeroplanes.First prototype undergoing trials;extensive changes necessary - wingsize had to be increased.Fall of France;    long term contractsheld up.Official tests started;    plane madeforced landing;;    several weeksnecessary to reconstruct damage.Further slight damage;    put right ina few days.Plane crashed owing to accidentaldetachment of part of wing covering.Second prototype had accident withgear wheel which stopped furthertesting;    now under repair.Expected to be ready for further testsStatement from Ministry that testsare still proceeding on take-off.In short, after a period of 3 years and 5 months, tests of theprototypes are not yet complete.15.      The Sub-Committee were informed that originally itwas intended that this aircraft should be built by Armstrong-Whitworths,   the de S 1  TIMS 2? S tj    but  this arrangement was changedand contracts for production were placed with Gloster aircraft the schedule of deliveries as originally planned with thelatter firm was that the first aircraft should be delivered inJune 1940;    by the end of 1940 just over 100 were expected;and by the end of July 1941 there should have been completed atotal of 496 - or about half the full number ordered.      Theremaining half were expected to be completed by January 1942.

16o    In fact... by June 1941 ?  only 2 out of some 430expected had been delivered.      The Sub-Committee were informed that on the present revised delivery schedule 40aircraft may be completed by the end of this year? December 1941?instead of over 900;    and that thereafter deliveries shouldbe at the rate of about 50 a months      Tnis schedule,  ifattained? would, result in 600 aircraft by the end of 1942 andthe completion of the 1.. COO ordered by June 1943c173    Inquiry into the causes of this delay of 18 months in the completion of the contracts olicixed the followingcommentSo(i)    The parent firm had been changed three timesc(ii)    The various contractors and sub-contractors had tobe educated to do things they had not previously dozie.(iii)    The fail of France led to long range programmes being put aside owing to the urgent need of getting all possiblemachines into the air immediately^,      At this time the greaterpart of the orders for the Ir.000 aircraft had been placed and sub-contractors were working or their tooling up and manufactur-ing processes^      During the  iutumn of 1940- the Ministry wereconcentrating on the  y* rarity types;    pressure for the Albei^-arleonly began about December 1940,      This machine has not got ahigh priority,  and it is only because it does not compete withother aircraft that the manufacturers have had no real difficulty with materials (except in the case of bolts).      Onthe other hand they claim that the lack of priority coupled with the considerable modifications and revisions of requirements set the whole programme bach by many months,(iv)    The unlucky time spacing of the various accidentshas been damaging to continued progress;    and added to this,last winter was extremal?/ baa for flying.      To these two latter circumstances the delay of ten months since the firstofficial trials started are attributed^(d) The..views&quot;- of witnesses oh the value of the aircraftP18,    It has been admitted that the technical troubles havebeen extensive and that to remedy them much remaking of jigsetc.  has been necessary..      But it is claimed that the troubleshave not been worse than in the case of some other types;    andthe Ministry are nox prepared to take a decision until thepresent trials are completed...      The manufacturers stated thatthey had no worriesc      They have flown the machine, they know its qualities and they have no reason to doubt that itwill do what is required of it;    though they did describe itas a shoddy aircraft,,     When pressed on this latter comment?they stated that shoddinoss was a criticism of the way it wasmade rather than of the qualities of the aircraft, and thatit was superior to types still being made - such as the Anson.The official witnesses were loss sanguine,      The best theycould say was that it would be a reasonably good aeroplane,but whether it would bo sufficiently good to&apos;justify going intomass production was not yet certain,.      Its qualities were known and it would do what was expected of it. but itsdegree of usefulness had yet to be determined,,      It was statedyhowever,  that the Air Staff still want this machine

9 0 0( e ) Cost So19,    Tho views and decisions set out above do not appearto have been considered in relation to the cost of this air-craft to the Exchequer.B      The facts are these,     A detailed statement of tho total costs up to the 27th May has beensubmitted,,      This shows that payments of  5*6 million hadalready been made before one machine had been delivered for operational use1.      It; has been stated by the Ministry that thepresent rate ox expenditure is  500,000 a month, so that bythe end of July well over  5 million has been spent.      Thismonthly figure relates solely to the expenditure on the airframeand does not take into account the engine and equipment.      Thetotal estimated value of the contracts for the airframe wasabout  16 million, to which must be added anything from another 7-10 million for engines, equipment,,  etc.. , making the completetotal around  25,000?000 - and probably more0      It is interest-ing to note that the price has not yet been fixed,(f) Conclusions^20,    In the light of these facts and giving full weight to all the extenuating circumstances only one conclusion seems possible - that the criticisms made to the Select Committeeabout the waste of time and money in the construction of this aircraft are fully justified whatever may be the decision onthe continuance of the contracts,21,    The original decision to try this experiment cannotbe the subject of comment or c:?iti oiism by the Select Committee,But,  once the decision has been taken, it is their duty toconsider whether this has been put into operation with suchefficiency as to avoid waste of money,      From the evidence available they cannot escape the impression that there hasbeen dilatoriness and insufficient energy displayed.      Theaffair has already caused widespread criticism of what is described by those who have been connected with this work aswasteful expenditure, and the grave misgivings caused by suchstatements cannot but have a bad effect upon production and progress.      Had the contractors been kept up to their originalschedule of deliveries,  it can hardly be doubted that much money would have been saved to tine taxpayer and that the Air force would have had at its disposal a number of machines at a timewhen it might have been able to use them to the maximum of their capacity.      Whether the likelihood of such use will still be present in the summer     of 1943, when the contract should becompleted, is another matter,22o    A long time has elapsed since the original proposal was made:  circumstances have completely changed, and some ofthe arguments then put forward have lost their validity,Labour is now in short supply and industries are being concentrated in order to &quot;bring about the most efficient use ofwhat is available.      Work on the Albemarle is not the only use to which the wood-wcrking industries are being put,      the engines and equipment now being made for this aircraft can be.used for other more valuable types of machine.      The evidenceindicates that this aircraft can hardly be considered as asatisfactory substitute for any existing metal type,      Duringthe long period of delay more advanced types of aircraft have proved successful and are now in full production.      On the otherhand,  it cannot be denied that,  if the final tests should provesuccessful,  it would provide an addition to our air strength;but the value of this addition must depend upon the time at whichit is made.

230    The Sub-Committee on Air Services were informed as recently as 1st August that the tests which it had been statedwere to begin in June wore still being made, and that theMinistry of Aircraft Production were still unable to give a date by which all tests were.&apos;likely to ho completode      In viewof the high monthly rate of expenditure on the airframecontracts alone and the fact that tests have now been inprogress for a period of ten months on an aeroplane which at best may he rated no higher&apos; than as a reasonably good machine 9it is pertinent to ask how the-Ministry can justify thecontinuance of this expenditure and the failure to come toa decision on further production.24o    It is fully recognised that the Ministry have beenfaced with a number of difficult prohleniSo      A considerablesum of money and much time and effort have already beenexpended in getting together the material,  jigs, tools andfixtures reqtiired for mass production;    many xDremises havebeen taken over to make component x^arts;    and all this has hadto he done whilst design and development were proceeding.      Adecision to cut their losses by stopping work and therebybreaking up a complex organisation and putting a certainnumber of factories temporarily out of production cannotlightly be takenc      But on the other hand it cannot fairly be delayed any longer,,      Even if the present tests prove thatthe design is now suitable to be put into production, it muststill be considered whether by the expenditure of another 20 million, in addition to the money already spent.,  thonation will got a product worth the outlay,,25c    It is already 3 years and 5 months since the birthof this idea.      Six millions have been spent and  300,000 isbeing further expended each month.      It will be over 5 years before the 1,000 machines ordered are delivered by which timethe expenditure will be over  26,000?000o26o    The Select Committee have come to- the conclusionthat this case,  in all its aspects, calls for immediate and urgent reconsideration^20th August, 1941*

*&quot;)    nFurther Memorandum addressed to the Prime Ministerfor the consideration of the War Cabinet, on 30thOctober, 1941,lo      On 21st August the Oc-ordinating Sub-Committee addressed &quot;a Memorandum to the Prime Minister for the consideration of theWar Cabinet on the sxxbject of the &quot;Albemarle&quot;. aircraft to whichthey again request attention.    On 19th September a suggestion wasconveyed by the Prime Minister, and subsequently announced by him in the House of Commons, that Lord Beaverbrook and Colonel Moore-Brabazon should be heard on the Memorandum with particular referenceto the operational aspects of the questions raised.    The SelectCommittee accepted this suggestion;    and on 22nd October the two ministers,, to whom the Committee wish to express their gratitude,were heard0,2a      From the evidence given by them it is understood that theoriginal order for 1,000 aeroplanes has recently been reduced to500e    They expressed the view that the production of this numbershould be proceeded with, notwithstanding that only about 150 areexpected to be delivered by the end of August, 19420    While it is realised that some of the parts are already in existence,  theCommittee note that this anticipated rate of delivery is slower than that indicated in their previous Memorandum^    The Committeeare not satisfied that the scheme, even as amended,  is likely tosecure the best utilisation of the finance, man-power and materials involved    In expressing this view they do not necessarilyquery the ministers  conclusion so far as it concerns the limitedpurpose of aircraft production alone;    but there are wider issues involved,    The national effort requires the most efficient use ofall materials and particularly of all labour that can be madeavailable.    Many of our war industries are still seriously short ofworkers.    It is from this aspect,  that of the n tional needs as awhole,  that the Committee are anxious that the matter should be againreviewed,  and they ask that the War Cabinet should so consider it.30      The Committee are not satisfied whether, even if an experiment of this kind -was justified, this particular experimenthas been oxpeditiously and efficiently carried outn^.^.^^J^ber^MJ^410
