THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (4,2) 20.January 17, 1942.WAR CABINET.CENTRAL PLANNING AUTHORITY.Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio.ON the 13th February, 1941 (W.M. (41) 17th Conclusions, minute 5), the WarCabinet approved proposals defining the scope of the duties of the Minister ofWorks and Buildings in preparing for the physical reconstruction of town and country after the war. Lord Reith was authorised to assume and this was included in the statement which he subsequently made in the House of Lords that the Government would be favourably disposed towards the principle of planning, as part of a national policy, and that some &quot;central planning authority&quot; would be required. The Government are thus pledged to theestablishment of a &quot; central planning authority &quot; to deal with the physicalreconstruction of town and country after the war.2. On the 11th July, 1941 (L.P. (41) 30th meeting, minute 3), the lord president&apos;s Committee considered the recommendations contained in the interimreport of a Committee under the Chairmanship of Mr. Justice Uthwatt, and onthe 17th July the Government, in an announcement in Parliament of their decisions upon those recommendations, undertook to introduce legislation on thecontrol of development during the war and on the replanning and reconstruction of damaged areas. A draft Bill (the Town and Country Planning(Reconstruction) Bill) is being prepared to give effect to this pledge.3. The circumstances which led up to the giving of these two pledges andto the preparation of the Bill are set out more fully in Appendix A to thismemorandum.4. Parliament has shown a sustained interest in the question what steps theGovernment are taking to implement these pledges, and it has from time to time been necessary to give temporising answers in both Houses. A motion byLord Samuel stands on the Order Paper of the House of Lords for the secondSitting Day after the 25th January to the effect that the establishment of a centralplanning authority and the introduction of legislation for the amendment and extension of the Town and Country Planning Acts should be no longer delayed.It is most undesirable that a further temporising answer should have to be given on this occasion. Moreover, before the second reading of the Town and country planning (Reconstruction) Bill, Parliament must be informed of the Government&apos;intentions as to the central planning authority and as to the general lines ofthe policy which the authority will pursue. It is, therefore, urgent that a decision should now be taken.5. In considering what recommendations they should make on this subject,the Committee on Reconstruction Problems have followed the principle that plans for the physical reconstruction of town and country must form part of a comprehensive policy for urban and rural development throughout the country as a whole, based on positive principles as to industrial location and as to themeasures to be taken for securing a proper balance between urban and rural development.[23331] b
26. The Committee on Reconstruction Problems have, subject to the roserva-tion stated in paragraph 7 below, agreed (R.P. (41) 4th Meeting andR.P. (41) 27) :-(i) That the Government should announce a policy for urban and rural development on the lines set out in Appendix B to this memorandum,(ii) That the work of the various departments concerned with urban and rural development should be unified in a committee of Ministers, tobe called the National Development Executive.- (iii) That the terms of reference of this body should be :  &quot; To concert the formulation of departmental plans affectingj physical reconstruction and development after the war. in the lightI   of approved Government policy on the social and economic problems involved, and to co-ordinate the work of the departments concernedwith the execution of those plans.&quot;(iv) That the Executive should sit under the chairmanship of a cabinet minister without departmental responsibilities, and should consist ofthe following Ministers :  The Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Minister of Labour and National Service.The Secretary of State for Scotland.The President of the Board of Trade.; The Minister of Health.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.The Minister of War Transport.The Minister of Works and Buildings.The Minister of Town and Country Planning.(v) That the Executive should be assisted by an interdepartmental com-mittee consisting of senior officials representing all members of theExecutive, the chairman of the interdepartmental committee being-responsible to the chairman of the Executive.   The functions of the interdepartmental committee would be to secure, so far as is possible by action taken at the departmental level, that the national policy fori  urban and rural development is carried out as a single and consistent-vj   whole, and to prepare and submit to the Executive the materialnecessary to enable them to decide on major questions of policy. involved.(vi) That the establishment of the Executive should not divest the individual ministers who compose it of their responsibility for taking actionwithin the spheres of their respective departments.(vii) That a new Ministry of Town and Country Planning should beestablished to supervise the formulation by local authorities, inEngland and Wales, of town and country planning schemes which willadequately reflect tho national policy for urban and rural development.The Ministry would be recognised as the department which localauthorities must consult on the general lines of town and country planning, and it would exercise the powers of the central government under the Town and Country Planning Acts, including the powers which will be available under the legislation shortly to be introduced to give effect to the First Report of the Uthwatt Committee, and itwould lay down the general principles to which town and country planning must conform.(viii) That the Secretary of State for Scotland should be responsible for theexercise in Scotland of the functions which the proposed new Ministerof Town and Countrv Planning would exercise in England andWales.(ix) That the proposed new Ministry should be established in legislation tobe introduced separately from the Town and Country Planning(Reconstruction) Bill and to be passed into law before the Parlia-mentary debates on that Bill,(x) That on the establishment of the proposed new Ministry the council ofMinisters sitting under the Minister of Works and Buildings shouldbe dissolved.
(xi) That the public announcement of the proposed arrangements should indicate that the pledge to establish a central planning authority is tobe implemented both by the establishment of the National DevelopmentExecutive and by the setting up of the new Ministry.The Minister of Labour and National Service reserved his position withregard to the establishment of the proposed new Ministry.8.   The War Cabinet is requested :  (i) To approve the recommendations recorded in 6 (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and(vi) above.(ii) To decide whether a new Ministry of Town and Country planning should be established to exercise in England and Wales the functions. I        set out in 6 (vii) above,(iii; If the decision on the last point is in the affirmative, to approve therecommendations recorded in 6 (viii), (ix), (x) and (xi) above.(Initialled)A. G.Richmond Terrace. S.W.I.-January 17. 1942.23331B 2
THE Minister ot Works and Buildings has been charged with the responsi-bility of consulting the departments and organisations concerned with a view toreporting to the Cabinet the appropriate methods and machinery for dealing withthe issues involved in the physical reconstruction of town and country afterthe war.2. On the 13th February, 1941, the Minister of Works and Buildings was authorised (W.M. (41) 17th Conclusions, minute 5) to proceed with this work onthe assumptions (a) that some central planning authority would be required, and(b) that the authority would be able to proceed in the light of a positive policyin regard to such matters as agriculture, industrial development and transport.These assumptions were announced to the House of Lords by the Minister ofWorks and Buildings on the 26th February, 1941. Subsequent statements madeon behalf of the Government, and, in particular, a statement made on the17th July, to which reference is made in the following paragraph, have made itclear that the Government are committed to the establishment of a centralplanning authority.3. On the 25th April. 1941, a committee under the chairmanship ofMr. Justice Uthwatt reported on the measures which should be taken now or before the end of the war to prevent the work of reconstruction thereafter beingprejudiced. The report (Cmd. 6291) was presented to Parliament on the17th July, and in a statement made in both Houses on that date the government undertook to introduce legislation dealing with control of development duringthe war and on the replanning and reconstruction of damaged areas. TheGovernment further announced that the following arrangements had been madein order to ensure that current administration of town and country &quot;planningstatutes should conform as closely as possible with developing long-term plans for the reconstruction of town and country after the war : (i) Within the framework of the general study of post-war problems whichis being undertaken by the Minister without Portfolio, the Ministerof Works and Buildings would retain special responsibility for long-term planning policy in the sphere of physical reconstruction,(ii) To co-ordinate this work of forward planning with the currentadministration of existing statutes, a council of Ministers wasappointed, consisting of The Right Hon. Lord Reith (Chairman).The Secretary of State for Scotland.The Minister of Health.The purpose and terms of reference of the council were : &quot; To ensure that the administration of the Town and country planning Acts and of any legislation implementing the recom-mendations made in the First Report of the Uthwatt committee shall proceed in conformity with long-term planning policy, asit is progressively developed.&quot;(iii) Pending the more complete formulation of long-term policy and theestablishment of the central planning authority in its final form theMinister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland would continue to be responsible for the current administration of theexisting statutes and of any new legislation implementing the first report of the Uthwatt Committee. These statutory powers would,however, be exercised in conformity with long-term planning policy as it is progressively developed; it would be-the function of the new council of Ministers to ensure that no action is taken under existing powers which would tend to prejudice the course of future recon-struction.4. The council of Ministers is supervising the preparation of a Bill (theTown and Country Planning (Reconstruction) Bill) to implement the pledge ofthe 17th July.
THE Government, will secure that the physical reconstruction of GreatBritain is carried out with a view to the utilisation of the land to the maximumsocial and economic advantage of the community.2. Working to this main objective, the principal aims of the Governmentwill be to secure the speedy provision of houses for those who need them, the redevelopment of devastated areas, the clearance of slums, the relief of over-crowding, the provision of all necessary public services, and the general promotion of rural development in the light of a positive policy for the maintenance of a healthy and well-balanced agriculture.3. The Government will review, having regard to subsequent developments and experience, the objectives stated in paragraph 4 of Section 428 of the Reportof the Royal Commission on the Distribution of the Industrial Population(Cmd. 6153), viz. :-(a) Continued and further redevelopment of ,congested urban areas, where necessary.(b) Decentralisation or dispersal, both of industries and industrial popula-tion, from congested areas.(c) Encouragement of a reasonable balance of industrial development, so faras possible, throughout the various divisions or regions of GreatBritain, coupled with the appropriate diversification of industry ineach division or region throughout the country.&quot;The Government will consider, in the light of the review, the steps that shouldbe taken to realise these objectives.4. In furthering their policy for urban and rural development, the Govern-ment will seek to avoid measures which would interfere with the overriding aim off raising the standard of living to the highest possible level. In particular, theGovernment (a) Will seek to ensure that fresh development is planned with due regard tothe use which can be made of existing capital equipment and existingpublic services, and will not wantonly countenance the break-up of oldand valuable industrial concentrations.(b) Will seek to avoid the diversion of productive agricultural land to other purposes if there is unproductive or less productive land that could resonably be used for those purposes.
