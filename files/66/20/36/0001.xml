THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  January 1942.SECEET. CoPy No-TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT&apos;S GOLD RESERVE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 21st October the Cabinet considered a memorandum (W.P. (41) 243)reviewing the history of the proposal to remove the gold reserve of the egyptian government, for reasons of safety, to India; and recommending that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should facilitate this operation by giving the guarantee against loss in transit without which the Egyptian Government were unwilling to take action.The Cabinet, moved by the consideration that news of the removal of the goldat that moment might give rise to alarmist and defeatist rumours, withheldapproval of the recommendation, while directing that it should be further considered in about six weeks&apos; time.The stage reached by the campaign in Libya now makes it opportune to reconsider this matter. The gold is safe; so that its removal in present circum-stances could not be ascribed to lack of confidence, and should not thereforeproduce the effects previously apprehended. Our Ambassador and the NationalBank of Egypt favour the removal of the gold. I therefore confirm my advice that His Majesty&apos;s Government should give the required guarantee, and proposethat Sir M. Lampson be instructed to complete the necessary arrangements.A. E.Foreign Office,January 2, 1942.W.P. (42) 5.January 2, 1942.11595   [23305]
