COMBINED OPERATIONS.Norway.1. H.M. Destroyers Inglefield and Intrepid, covered by H.M.S. Sheffield,raided Helle Fiord, between Bergen and-Trphdheim, on the night of the 6th/7th.A medium-sized merchant ship and two trawlers, were sunk off Floro and aGerman canning factory was shelled. Little opposition was encountered and our ships suffered neither damage nor casualties. Long-range Blenheim fighters of coastal Command provided continuous daylight escort and, while the raid wasin progress, Whitleys of Bomber Command successfully bombed the aerodrome atSola (Stavanger), hitting runways, administrative buildings and hangars; twoof the latter were left burning fiercely.  All our aircraft returned safely.NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.2.   A raid on the Norwegian Coast has been successfully carried out by light forces of the Home Fleet in co-operation with the Royal Air Force.A large enemy convoy, heavily escorted, has reached Tripoli (L).Shipping losses have been light.Enemy minelaying persists off the East Coast.Home Waters and North Atlantic.3. H.M.S. Scottish (Armed Boarding Vessel) was attacked by Focke Wulfaircraft off the Tagus on the 2nd. She drove off the aircraft, but received minor damage and suffered two casualties.On the 4th H.M.S. A lecto (submarine Depot ship), sustained damage in heavyweather.It is estimated that 15,000 tons of enemy shipping have been damaged by our aircraft during the period under review. Details are given in the air situation.Mediterranean.4. On the 4th, reconnaissance aircraft reported one Italian battleship andthree cruisers, accompanied by destroyers, 100 miles south-west of Greece steeringsouth-south-west. On the following morning this force was reported to have turned -north, and a convoy of nine large merchant ships was sighted enteringTripoli (L) harbour.On the morning of the 30th December H.M. Submarine Proteus claimed onehit on a 4,000-ton escorted transport to the west of Cephalonia, and in the samelocality on the same day H.M. Submarine Thorn claimed three hits on a ladentanker of 6,000 tons. On the 5th January Proteus, to the northward ofCephalonia, off Sta. Maura, attacked two 8,000-ton transports, one of which, withtroops on board, was sunk.H.M.S. A jaw, escorted by six destroyers, carried out a successful bombard-ment of Bardia on the night of the 30th/31st December. General Auchinleck has reported that maintenance difficulties in the forward areas in Libya were beingovercome, largely due to the efforts of the Royal Navy in keeping Tobruk supplied with quantities of stores.During an air raid on Malta on the night of the 3rd HM. Destroyers Zuluand Havock were slightly damaged; Havock had one officer and two ratings killed and two ratings wounded.During the week ten French ships (upward of 45,000 tons) passed Gibraltareastbound and fifteen ships (43,166 tons) westbound.Far East.Pacific.5. Air reconnaissance on the 31st December reported three cruisers, ninedestroyers, six U-boats, one depot ship, twelve transports and six miscellaneouscraft in the Gulf of Davao in the Southern Philippines.   On the 3rd January
eight American aircraft attacked this force. One destroyer was sunk, three hits were claimed on a battleship and other naval units were hit. All the aircraftreturned safely. The Japanese have admitted that one cruiser was damaged inthis attack, and have also reported the loss of one U-boat in the Pacific.6.   Small islands in the Hawaiian group and Canton Island in the Phoenixgroup have been bombarded, presumably by U-boats.South China Sea.7.   The Dutch submarines 0.20 and K. 16 are overdue at Singapore andSourabaya respectively.About 100 enemy small craft were observed in Penang harbour on the 5th.Antisubmarine Operations.8. In the Atlantic a merchant ship attempted, unsuccessfully, to ram aU-boat 100 miles north-west of the Butt of Lewis, and an American destroyerattacked a contact off Newfoundland.In the Mediterranean two aircraft attacks were carried out, in one of which two hits were claimed.A U-boat has been attacked off Vancouver Island.-Enemy Intelligence.Main Units.9. There is no important change in the position of German and Italianmain units. The Cavour class battleship which was sunk in the air attack onTaranto&apos; and subsequently raised has now left the port, and it is consideredprobable that she has proceeded to Genoa or Trieste for extensive repairs.U-boats.10. There has been little activity by U-boats in the period under review,though it appears that several are moving westward in the Atlantic and others are on patrol in the Azores area.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. A Dutch merchant ship reported that she had been shelled by a U-boatsouth of Java; otherwise there have been no U-boat attacks during the week.On the East Coast three ships have been sunk by mines and two others havebeen damaged. Aircraft have unsuccessfully attacked shipping in the Faroes,and one ship in a northbound coastal convoy was slightly damaged on the east coast.The mercantile losses during the month of December, reported to date, areas follows : * 	Atlantic		Pacific.

Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. During the week ending the 7th January 886 ships, including 207 allied and 15 neutral, were convoyed. Two cruisers, 4 anti-aircraft ships,77 destroyers (including 24 United States destroyers) and 91 sloops, corvettesand minesweepers were employed on escort duties. During the month ofDecember 4,116 ships were convoyed, of which 17 were lost by enemy action.Since the beginning of the war 493 ships have been lost out of 98,367 ships whichhave been convoyed.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending the 3rd January totalled 648,000 tons, compared with 841,000 tons during theprevious seven days, and an average of 868,000 for the past ten weeks. Of theweek&apos;s total, 271,000 tons were oil of various grades.British Minelaying.13. During the week mines were laid by surface craft off the Butt of Lewis,and minelaying by aircraft has been carried out in the North Sea and off FrenchBiscay ports.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.14. On one night in the week enemy aircraft were minelaying in the thames estuary, and E-boats have been active in the outer War Channel off Smith&apos;sKnoll and to the east of South wold.Twenty-four magnetic and four acoustic mines have been destroyed, and the mine totals are now : Magnetic 1,712, Acoustic 1,222, and Contact 1,068.Foreign Waters.15. About 14 mines are reported to have been swept off Sourabaya (Java),but it is not yet known whether the port is open.Enemy Merchant Shipping.16. Japan has informed the Union of South Africa that the Hikawa Maru,9,326 tons, Asahi Maru, 9,326 tons, and Takasago Maru, 9,347 tons, are being used as hospital ships.British Contraband Control.17. During the month of December only 2,240 tons of goods destined for theenemy were seized in prize. The cargoes consisted almost entirely of food-stuffsfrom Vichien ships.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.18. The&apos; German withdrawal is now ii. its fifth week. During the past week the Russians have continued to make good progress.Central Sector.19. North-west of Moscow the Russians have made further progress in thedirection of Rzhev.South-west of Moscow the Germans have again been forced to make bigwithdrawals. They are now on a line running from Borovsk west of MaloYaroslavets to just north of Kaluga, thence in a pronounced salient throughYukhnov and Suchinitchi to Belev.
The above advances, according to the Russians, constitute a pincer move-ment. In the Mozhaisk area, between the arms of the pincer, the Russians hope to pin the Germans to their ground and destroy their forces on this whole sector.Further south strong Russian attacks against Kursk continue.Ukraine.20.   In Northern Ukraine the Russians have broken through between Oboyanand Byelgorod.There has been no change in the situation in the Donetz Basin or along theRiver Mius, but the Russian General Staff are confident of early progress inthese sectors.Crimea.21. The Russian General Staff state that not only have the attacks onSevastopol been repulsed with heavy losses, but that the Russian counter-attacks in this area have gained some ground. At the eastern end of the Crimea, russian army, Naval and Air Forces have co-operated in a successful attack on the Kerchpeninsula, with the result that the area East of Feodosia is now clear of theenemy.Libya. .       \22. The outstanding event of the past week has been the capture of Bardiaby a force under the command of Major-General I. P. de Villiers consisting ofthe 2nd South African Division, part of the 1st South African Division and the1st Army Tank Brigade. The higher direction of the operations was in the handsof Major-General C. M. WiHoughby-Norrie, commanding the 30th ArmouredCorps.Before the first assault, the position was subjected to a heavy bombardmentfrom the land, sea and air. The land attack began in the early hours of the31st December, and by mid-day the first objectives had been reached. A counter-attack by German infantry supported by tanks was repelled. The second phasebegan on the night of the lst/2nd January, and culminated in a moonlightbayonet charge. On the following morning the garrison, which was under the command of Major-General Schmitt, surrendered unconditionally.Including wounded, over 8,000 prisoners were captured, of whom 1,800 wereGerman. In addition, 1,150 of our own prisoners, of whom 650 were NewZealanders, were recovered. Our losses were light, amounting to only 60 killed and 300 wounded.23. The Sollum-Halfaya position still remains to be reduced. It has beenlately subjected to a heavy scale of aerial bombardment, and leaflets invitingsurrender have been dropped. The garrison is apparently receiving supplies by air at night, but their administrative position must be critical. Naqb-el-Terras,2^ miles south-west of Sollum, was captured on the night of th? 5th/6th January.24. In Western Cyrenaica pressure has been maintained on the enemy aboutJedabya by the comparatively small force which General Ritchie is as yet ableto deploy in the forward area. In the tank battles of the 28th and 30th December,described in last week&apos;s Resume, the enemy succeeded in countering our attemptto envelop his southern flank. Most strenuous efforts are now being made tobuild up a supply organisation capable of maintaining a strong force. Theopening of the port of Benghazi, which it is hoped will be possible in the courseof the next few days, will greatly ease the administrative situation.On the morning of the 7th January our patrols reported that Jedabya was clear of the enemy, and our forces have followed up, although very bad weather and poor visibility have hampered their progress considerably.The Far Bast.Malaya.25.   General Wavell arrived at Singapore on the 7th January.26. During the past week activity has increased considerably, and theJapanese are pushing their offensive strenuously on all fronts, though not without considerable losses.
27. In the East, the 9th Indian Division has withdrawn to the area Raub-Bentong after destroying the ferry at Jerantut.28. In the West, the enemy penetrations up the Perak, Bernam and SelangorRivers constitute a threat to our lines of communication, and have alreadynecessitated some further withdrawal by the 11th Indian Division to the southof Slim River. The number of enemy tanks operating in this area is estimated to be 30. For this new feature of operations the Japanese are using smallsteamers and river craft, which they were reported last week to be concentratingat Penang. Sharp engagements have taken place in which heavy losses have beeninflicted on the Japanese.29. The 45th Indian Infantry Brigade, less transport and some ancillarytroops, has arrived at Singapore.Borneo and Sarawak.30. The Japanese landed at Labuan on the 1st January and at Westonon the 3rd. All but 50 of the 2nd/15th Punjabis, who were at Kuching, havearrived in Dutch Borneo, and have been placed under Dutch command.Philippines.31. Manila was occupied by the Japanese on the 2nd January. TheAmerican and Filipino troops have withdrawn to the north-west of the city,and are occupying strong positions. The fortified island of Corregidor, coveringManila Bay, is still in their possession. The enemy landed at Jolo, 100 miles south-west of Mindanao on the 2nd January. Contact with the enemy has beenestablished along the whole length of the new position.Intelligence,Western Pacific.32. The Trans-Pacific Air Reinforcement route via Hawaii-Canton Island-Fiji-New Caledonia and Australia was opened on the 28th December.Norway.33. A report suggests that the mountain division which was believed to bereturning to Germany f rom Finland may now have been sent to Narvik. Anothermountain division from Finland has already been reported to be resting atKirkenet,.The Germany army of occupation in Norway remains at a strength of eightdivisions. This figure does not include the mountain divisions referred to above,which are probably not regarded as occupational troops.AIR SITUATION.General Review.34.   Brest was bombed on five nights.Bad weather hampered our air operations in Libya. Many enemy aircraft were destroyed and damaged on the ground at Castelvetrano (Sicily). heavy attacks were again directed against our aerodromes in Malta.Germany and Occupied Territory.Bay.35. Bomber Command despatched 24 and Fighter Command 133 offensive sorties.   Attacks on shipping are reported under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;36. Spitfires attacked alcohol distilleries at Colleville (near Fecamp) andFontaine le Dun (near Dieppe); in both cases essential buildings were hit.Hampdens, on roving commissions, successfully bombed and machine-gunnedfactories, trains and a railway station in north-west Germany.
Night.37. Bomber Command despatched 508 sorties, compared with 424 lastweek, and lost only three aircraft. A total of 514 tons of H.E. bombs (including17 of 4,000 lbs. and 52 of 2,000 lbs.), and 24,000 incendiaries were dropped.Unsuitable weather prevented operations on two nights. The principal effort was directed against the Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen, which were attacked on each of the remaining nights of the week.38. On the night of the 5th, 140 aircraft dropped 203 tons of H.E. bombs and 7,200 incendiaries on the dock area at Brest, and, on four other nights, atotal of 126 aircraft dropped a further 186 tons of H.E. bombs and 12,680incendiaries on the same objective. Visibility was generally poor, but, duringthe heaviest raid, occasional gaps in the cloud enabled the crews to observebomb bursts in the dock and dry-dock areas and along the torpedo boat quay.They also saw large fires followed by explosions in the town and Port Militaire.39. St. Nazaire and Cherbourg docks were bombed on two nights, several large fires resulting at each of the targets. The submarine pens at St. Nazaireare believed to have been straddled.United Kingdom.40. Fighter Command despatched 1,343 sorties by day and 300 sorties by night. Enemy activity was on a small scale and confined to operations in coastal areas.Coastal Operations.41. Coastal Command flew 193 patrols (282 sorties) and provided 23 convoy escorts (30 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Commandtotalled 359 (906 sorties).42. Spitfires seriously damaged a guard ship off Le Treport. Wellingtons,engaged in the main attack on Brest, set fire to two flak ships in that area.Hudsons reported two hits and two near misses on a merchant vessel of5,500 tons in convoy off the Frisian Islands, and dropped bombs from a low levelon a 6,000-ton merchant vessel off Terschelling, causing a large reel explosiontwo minutes after the attack; two hits amidships were claimed on a 2,500-ton merchant vessel in convoy off Norderney.43. Five Hudsons and a Beaufort attacked single merchant vessels at night in the Bergen area. One of these (of 1,000 tons) appeared to have been hit, but other results were unobserved owing to evasive action necessitated by intenseflak and searchlight activity. An enemy aircraft attempting interception was probably destroyed : two Hudsons failed to return.44. A total of 47 aircraft was despatched to lay sea mines off St. Nazaire,La Pallice and the Frisian Islands, and in the Gironde river.45. Enemy activity by day included a shipping attack off Dungeness andanother in the Lisbon area. Three night attacks were made on shipping offRattray Head, the Faroes and Land&apos;s End and minelaying in the thames estuary was reported on one night.Mediterranean.Libya.46. Blenheims continued their close co-operation with, our ground forcesuntil the fall of Bardia on the 2nd, and, after being grounded for two days bybad weather, maintained continuous attacks on the Halfaya defences during thenext four days. In the frontier area three Blenheim squadrons with fighter escort attacked 2,000 dispersed M..T. south-east of Jedabya, starting five firesand blowing up an ammunition waggon. Night operations by Wellingtonsconsisted of attacks on jetties, stores, dumps and M.T. near Ras El Ali, west of el Agheila. Owing to bad weather, results were difficult to observe, but at least13 vehicles were destroyed and others were demaged. Hits were also made onthe jetty, and fires were started among buildings.
47. Anti-shipping sweeps in the Gulf of Sirte were mainly uneventful, buta small ship of 800 tons was attacked and hit by Blenheims. Other aircraft,unable to locate shipping, attacked the Beuret El Hsun area, obtaining hits onbarracks, gun emplacements, and in M.T. parks, where fires were started. Twomedium-sized merchant ships were attacked at night off eastern Tunisia by naval aircraft, and one of them was last seen stationary, with a destroyeralongside.48. Minelaying and attacks on shipping in Tripoli (L) harbour were only partially successful, owing to bad weather. The capture of forward aerodromes in Cyrenaica brought Tripoli (L) within range of Wellingtons based on Egypt.49. Beaufighters made two attacks on M.T. on the coast road west of el Agheila, in the course of which they destroyed 15 vehicles, damaged 40 andinflicted heavy casualties on personnel. Standing fighter patrols over Benghazidestroyed an enemy bomber and damaged three others, and prevented any effectiveattack on the harbour. Escorts were provided for our reconnaissance aircraft,and, in the course of an engagement east of El Agheila, Tomahawks probably destroyed four and damaged one enemy fighter, for the loss of seven of their ownnumber. Continuous fighter patrols were maintained over the Jedabya area, butonly one major combat resulted. Five Kittyhawks attacked a formation of16 Ju. 87&apos;s escorted by six Me. 109&apos;s and forced the former to jettison theirbombs. They destroyed four Ju. 87&apos;s and one Me. 109 and probably destroyed two and damaged four of the remainder. One Kittyhawk was lost. This is thefirst report, received of the Kittyhawk in action; this single-engined fighter is a development of the Tomahawk.50. Enemy aircraft were more active than last week, and made ineffectivedaylight attacks on Gambut, Bardia, Tobruk and Benghazi. The latter townwas also attacked by night and a small oil dump and an empty hangar wereburnt. Other night attacks were made on Tobruk, in which 17 aircraft took partbut caused no damage, and on three of our landing grounds, in which a Blenheimwas destroyed and five M.T. vehicles and another aircraft were damaged.51. Towards the end of the period there was some reconnaissance activityover the Delta area.Malta.52. Heavy attacks by day and night were continued against our aerodromes in Malta. Takali and Halfar were rendered unserviceable on the 6th and 7th,while our operations were considerably restricted at Luqa, where the surface wasbadly cratered, and seven medium bombers were destroyed and seven others damaged. There were some casualties to service personnel, and a number of buildings were damaged. The heaviest raids took place on the 4th when a forceof about 30 bombers and fighters twice attacked Luqa, and 56 aircraft attackedTakali.53. Our fighters were often unable to operate owing to bad weather, butshot down at least three enemy aircraft, while A.A. defences destroyed a fourth and damaged several others.Italy.54. A small force of Wellingtons made a night attack on Naples, startingfires in or near the railway station and near the I.M.A.M. air frame works.Sicily.55. As a result of a photographic reconnaissance, ten Blenheims made adaylight raid on Castelvetrano aerodrome. Seventy-five closely packed transport aircraft were bombed from a low level, and at least 30 were destroyed by fire and many others were seriously damaged. Heavy casualties were inflicted ontroops by machine-gun fire. Nine Wellingtons followed up this attack duringthe night, and dropped over 13 tons of bombs over a period of nine hours. fires were seen all over the aerodrome, and 14 aircraft were seen to be burning.A petrol dump exploded, starting an extensive fire on the edge of the aerodrome.From these two successful attacks one Wellington is missing.
Greece and Crete,56. Three Wellingtons from Egypt made night attacks on the harbour atSalamis. The submarine base was hit, and bombs were seen to burst on a jetty,and near a munition factory and the torpedo depot. Supplies were again droppedfor our troops at liberty in Southern Greece and Crete.57. The landing ground at Selina Kastelli, south-west Crete, was bombed by one Wellington, which observed fires and explosions after the attack.Leaflets were dropped at Heraklion and Retimo.Russia.58. German Air Force operations have continued with little variation fromthose reported last week. Heavy snowfalls in south Russia have probably addedto existing operational difficulties and made it impossible to bring the maximumscale of attack to bear.59. It is reported that Russian aircraft are extensively fitted with skis for operations under winter conditions, but there is no evidence to show that german air Force units are also thus equipped.The Far East.Malaya.60. The Japanese have brought Gong Kedah, Machang, Butterworth,Taiping and Ipoh aerodromes into use. Kuantan aerodrome, 180 miles from singapore, is also in their hands.61. On the 1st, three Netherlands East Indies Glenn Martins sighted fourlaunches, each towing two to five small craft, in the south Bernam Estuary(30 miles S.S.E. of Bindings). Two of these aircraft failed to return and twoBlenheims, despatched later to attack the launches, are missing. Two Catalinasbombed, and machine-gunned Gong Kedah aerodrome, hitting the runway and setting fire to at least two enemy aircraft.62. On the 3rd, Blenheims attacked two ships engaged in towing small craft, off Kuala Selangor, and sank one. They later machine-gunned a numberof small craft ten miles south of Penang, setting one of them on fire.63. On the 1st, single enemy aircraft twice attacked the Tengah district;two Swordfish were destroyed on the ground and the aerodrome wras renderedtemporarily unserviceable. Several raids were made on Port Swettenham,where a fire was started in a rubber go-down. Throughout the 2nd and 3rd,enemy fighter patrols were active over Kuala Selangor and machine-gunnedmovements of our ground forces.64. On the night of the 2nd, Tengah was again attacked; a building wasburnt out and severely damaged, and a direct hit was made on a bomb-proofoperations room. Raids on Singapore took place also at night on the 4th/5th, andin daylight on the 6th, but damage is reported as negligible.65. Enemy aircraft attacked Kluang on several occasions; four of our aircraft were destroyed on the ground and three were damaged, but the aerodromeremained serviceable. Heavy bombing raids were continued by the enemy againstroad and rail communications near Rawang, and the railway between that place and Tanjong Malin was rendered unusable. On the night of the 2nd, seven aircraft bombed and machine-gunned Tanjong Malin; one of these aircraftcrashed.Burma.66. On the 3rd, the American Volunteer Group attacked Raheng aerodrome(Thailand, 200 miles east of Rangoon). Three enemy aircraft were shot down,and four were destroyed on the ground, all without loss to ourselves.67. On the 4th, over 30 Japanese fighters attacked Rangoon; one was shot down and one damaged. The American Volunteer Group lost three aircraft, butthe pilots are safe.   There were raids on the 5th and 6th on Mino-aladon
aerodrome, but the damage was slight and there were no casualties. Rangoonwas again raided, on the 7th, and minor damage to the aerodrome resulted. Tavoywas bombed without damage. Martaban (75 miles east of. Rangoon) was also attacked but details are not yet known.Sumatra.68. On the 1st, three enemy aircraft bombed Labban Bilik (140 miles.E. of Medan) and caused damage to small shipping. Several raids were madeon Medan, but little damage resulted. On the 6th, enemy aircraft attackedPakanbaroe (150 miles W.S.W. of Singapore); the damage is not yet known.Philippines.69. Since last week&apos;s Resume went to press, reports have been received thatManila was bombed on the 28th of December by 63 bombers, and that on the next day 60 aircraft bombed the fortress of Corregidor. On the 1st of January,Japanese dive-bombers were reported to be dominating all roads leading toManila, and, on the 2nd, Corregidor was again raided by 60 bombers.Pacific.70. On the 1st, aircraft of the Royal Australian Air Force attackedKapingamarangi Island (about 450 miles north of the Solomon Islands) andstarted two large fires.71. On the night of the 3rd and on the 4th, 33 enemy aircraft dropped bombshear two aerodromes at Rabaul (New Britain Island, 300 miles north-east ofNew Guinea). No damage or casualties resulted. Vanakanae Aerodrome,Rabaul, was attacked by nine flying-boats on the 6th.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.72. There were only two bombing incidents during the week. At Tweed-mouth the railway was damaged and some persons were killed, and at WestHartlepool the premises of Northern Smelting and Chemical Company were damaged.Casualties.73. Estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 the 7th Januaryare four killed and six severely injured.

During the raid on the 23rd/24th of October the Deutsche WerkeShipbuilding Yard was hit three times. A joinery shop was completely destroyedby fire and other sections of the works were affected. Production still continuesbut approximately 1,000 of the employees were unemployed until repairs had been effected.Hamburg, The Hamburger Fremdenblatt of the 6th of December publishesthe names of 63 persons killed in the raid on the 30th November/1st December.General.
