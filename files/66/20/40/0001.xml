plS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT.)COPY NO. C3fWAR CABINS.?THE ALBEMARLE AIRCRAFTeI^January.   1942aJoint Memorandum &quot;by the Minister ox Supply3 theSecretary of State for Air and the Minister of aircraft Production^There are two separate hut inter-related points  in thefurther Memorandum on the ALBEMARLE aircraft, addressed to thePrime Minister hy the Select Committee on National Expenditureon 30th October (boo W,?.(42) V-S)(i)   Whether the completion of any Albemarles represents the best utilisation of labour and materials,(ii)    Whether,  in any eventP as many as 500 of these machines should be completed^The answer to these two points is given below:-20   ,  When the future of Albemarle production was reviewed inSeptember, 1941, the Air Ministry agreed in advance to acceptthe cutting off of Albemarle production at whatever point theMVAtfPo regarded as most economical^3.      Production of Alberaarle airframes is divisible into three main stages:-(a) The fabrication of the materials - eeg, ,  steeltubing,  steel forgings,  plywood sheet0(b) Machining of these material and assembly of the parts thus produced into units forming the maincomponents of the complete airfr-amec This work is wholly carried out by sub-contractors,,(c) Final assembly,  erection and flight testing,,    this work is wholly carried out hy the main contractors40      Examination of Progress Reports as at 31st August,  1941,revealed the following position in connection with each of these three stages:-(a) The fabrication of the materials was substantiallycompleted for 500 aircraft,,(b) Work was completed or in hand for an average of 300Albemarle airframes0(c) The work of final assembly had hardly begun,,

5n      The expenditure incurred up to 31, 8041 and theestimated expenditure necessary to corrrolete 500 Albemarleairframes is :-IncurredFurtherBx&quot;oendituremired,. 7,685,000 s  15,370 per airframe 4,780,000 a   9,560 per airframeA total of  24,950 per air frameThese figures excludeaccessories,   turrets,111!inofj trumeritthethebutthe cost of guns, radioengines, airscrewSj engineequipment  and otherinclude the cost of installing the equipmentairframe,    It is expected that payments in respectcancellation of the contract in excess of 500 machines&quot;ill be approximately 350,000and that saleable materialvaiueat  250,000 will be recovered,6,,      The cost of a Whit ley airframe on a comparable&quot;basis is  20,740,7-      It is estimated that had the Albemarle contractsbeen completely cancelled,  saleable material valued at 1,250.,000 would have been recovered, &quot;but that expenditureof . 1:750,000  -onId have been incurred in payments underbreak clauses plus substantial overhead charges entailedj,n the course of liquidation.Complete cancellation would therefore have involved a total expenditure in excess of 7f million pounds for noultimate output whatever.    By continuing with the productionof 500 Albemarles a further expenditure of about 4^ millionpounds will produce 500 servicable airframes - a definitecontribution to the war effort,8,      The same expenditure - i, e.  about 4f: million-pounds - would produce less than one half of the number ofWhitley airframes which are of comparable type.    Moreover,the Albemarle uses, material   fabricating capacity and asub-contracting organisation which are substantially ofdifferent type from that employed in the production of otheroperational aircraft,,The material fabricators and the sub-contractors forthe Albemarle are not equipped with the plant, the type of skilled labour or the technical experience which would benecessary if they were to change over to the manufacture ofthe normal all-metal type of aeroplane.Even if the Albeioarle had been abandoned and theexpenditure, whether measured in money or man-power, had been applied to Whiitvoys,  the equivalent in Whit leys could not havebeen produced so rapidly,  as the necessary plant tn -p-^orieatematerials for additional Whitleys does not exis Ls-2-

Similarly, If the labour still required to complete the 500 Albemarle airframes had been diverted to other forms of armament production, it is highly unlikely that, quite apartfrom the loss involved on materials in the complete abandonment ofthe Alhemarle project, any contribution to the war effort wouldhave resulted comparable with that which will accrue from thecompletion of the 500 machines proposed,9a      Albemarle deliveries will play a useful part inalleviating the aircraft shortage over the next eighteen months,,The first ,300 Alhemarles are to be produced as bombers and willxbe used to form advanced training squadrons in Bomber Oommand andfor air gunnery schools.    These squadrons will afford valuabletraining for aircrews until an adequate supply of Liberators is available.It is hoped to produce the last 300 Albemarles in theform of transport aircraft which will also be suitable for use astugs for gliders and for dropping paratroops.    The necessarydevelopment work is in hand and shows condierable promise.    At alater date, Albemarle deliveries in this form would be a welcomecontribution to aircraft supply, as without them it would be amatter of great difficulty to provide the aircraft needed, forthe transport and air-borne forces roles.B.A.H.M.S.J.T.C.M.-B.5th January.  1942a
