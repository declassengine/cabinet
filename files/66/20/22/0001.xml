Anti-Submarine Operations.6. H.M. Destroyer Farndale sank an Italian U-boat off Bardia and tookprisoner six officers and forty-seven ratings. Aircraft made three other attacksoff the Libyan coast. To the westward of Gibraltar a number of attacks were carried out by air and surface craft, but although hits were claimed by aircraft in two cases, there was no definite evidence of destruction. Another attack wasmade by a United States destroyer south of Newfoundland.Far Bast.Malaya7. Early on the 6th December two Japanese convoys of twenty-fiveand ten ships respectively, each escorted by cruisers and destroyers and boundto the westward, were sighted by aircraft off Cambodia Point, FrenchIndo-China. On the 8th, landings were made from fifteen ships on the northernMalayan coast, as reported in the Military Situation. Aircraft reconnaissanceon the 9th sighted one battleship and three cruisers, with eleven destroyers andtransports off Kota Bahru, and an aircraft-carrier off Singora, Kra Isthmus.On the 10th, H.M.S.

Four attacks were made onPrince of Wales, which was hit by four or five torpedoes and one large bomb.She heeled over slowly and capsized in about twenty minutes. Approximately 130officers and 2,200 ratings have been rescued and landed at Singapore. TheCommander-in-Chief is missing. During the engagement at least seven enemy aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire.Philippines.8. Large-scale landings are being attempted on Luzon, with naval and air support. The Japanese Battleship Haruna (1911. Eight 14-2-inch, 29,300 tons)has been hit by United States bombers to the north of Luzon.

The United States Navy Department announce that one Japanese light cruiser, one destroyer and ten aircraft were destroyed during an attack on the island on the 10th.Honoluhb.13. Japanese aircraft and U-boats attacked Pearl Harbour at 1830 on the7th. The Battleship Oklahoma (1912. Ten-14-inch, 29,000 tons) was hit andcapsized and the Battleship Tennessee (1915. Twelve 14-inch, 32,300 tons) was set on fire. One destroyer in dock was blown up and another destroyer and theMinelayer Oglala (1907. 4,200 tons) were set on fire. Casualties among UnitedStates Naval Personnel were heavy. One U-boat and at least two enemy aircraft are reported to have,been destroyed.[23249] . B
Enemy Intelligence.14. The German main units in the Baltic have been engaged in intensiveexercises during the week.U-boats.There has been a concentration of U-boats in the Gibraltar area throughoutthe week, and a smaller number have been working in the North-western approaches, but otherwise there has been little activity either in the North or south Atlantic. Fifteen or sixteen U-boats are believed to be operating in theMediterranean.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.15. Two ships, possibly three, of a homeward-bound convoy have been torpedoed and sunk 300 miles west of Ireland. Apart from this the shippingcasualties reported during the period were all caused by mines. Two small vessels were sunk off Cromer and. in the same vicinity, a larger ship was beached andis likely to become a total loss. A small coaster was sunk near Cardiff. no reports have yet been received of shipping casualties in Far Eastern waters.The shipping losses in November (details are given in Appendix I) weretwenty-six ships and six small craft totalling 100,491 tons, of which twenty-three ships and five small craft (88,003 tons) were British. This total is about 97,000tons lower than in the previous month. With the exception of March 1940(98,000 tons), it represents the lowest monthly loss since the beginning of thewar. U-boats sank eleven ships, five of which were to the eastward of the BelleIsle Strait and one as far south as the latitude of Walfish Bay. One ship andtluee small craft were mined in Home Waters. Seven ships were sunk by E-boats off the Norfolk coast. Aircraft sank seven ships and three small craft, of whichsix were off the East Coast, one off Southern Ireland, one off the Faeroes and twooff the northern coast of Tunisia. In addition, four ships and two small craft,totalling 15,198 tons, which are included in Appendix I were reported inNovember although lost in previous months.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. During the week ending the 10th December 978 ships, including244 Allied and 26 neutral, were convoyed. Three cruisers, seven anti-aircraftships, one armed merchant cruiser and one ocean boarding vessel, 82 destroyers(including 22 United States destroyers) and 83 sloops, corvettes and minesweeperswere employed on escort duties. Since the beginning of the war, 94,684 ships have been convoyed, of which 478 have been lost by enemy action.Imports into the United Kingdom during the week ending the 6th Decembertotalled 973,000 tons, compared with an average for the past ten weeks of922,600 tons.   Oil imports were 276,705 tons.British Minelaying.17. During the week mines have been laid in the Butt of Lewis area. Mine-laying by aircraft has been carried out in daylight off the Frisian Islands.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.18.   E-boats have again laid mines in the East Coast War Channel.Minelaying by aircraft took place on two nights of the week off the East-Coast, between the Humber and! the Tyne.Forty-three magnetic and six acoustic mines have been destroyed during theweek.  The mine totals now are : magnetic 1,593, acoustic 1,182 and contact 1,063.Enemy Merchant Shipping.19. According to a Norwegian broadcast, the Norwegian Vestra (1,422tons) was sunk by a British aircraft on the 4th December. The Swedish Equator(4,595 tons) is reported to have sunk after grounding.
The German Eisenach (4,423 tons), which was scuttled on the 31st Marchat Punta Areans, Costa Rica, has been refloated.Two Italian tankers, the Anteo (6,772 tons) and the Rapcdlo (5,812 tons), havebeen seized by the Colombian Government at Cartagena. An agreement hasbeen signed by which eight Italian ships (totalling 40,000 tons) now in Brazilianharbours are transferred to Brazil.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Leningrad Sector.20. It was recently learnt that the German thrust east of Leningrad caused the Russians no anxiety, as they considered the German supply situation in this area to be very insecure. The Russian report of the recapture of Tikhvin, some120 miles east of Leningrad, is thus no surprise. It, moreover, is of greatimportance, as it leads to the possibility of reopening rail communication between Leningrad and Vologda, and also of denying to the Germans thepossibility of linking up with Finnish forces on the River Svir.Central Sector.21. On the 8th December the German official communique contained the phrase &quot; from now onwards the continuation of operations and the manner inwhich they will be conducted will depend upon the beginning of winter on theEastern front, where only local operations are now taking place.&quot; These words,taken in conjunction with other evidence, strongly suggest a forcedstabilisation on most of the Russian front. There are many reasons why theGermans should have decided upon this course : intense cold, bad road conditions,maintenance difficulties, lack of reserves and the need for finding suitablewinter quarters for their troops; last, but no least, the stubborn and courageousresistance of the Russians. There is also just a possibility that only bystabilisation would the Germans be able to find troops to resume the offensivetowards Rostov.22. It is reported that a large part of the Russian reserves in the Moscowsector have not been employed, and that the armament, equipment and trainingof the Russian troops in this sector are good.Taganrog Sector.23. Fierce fighting continues around and to the north of Taganrog, wherethe Russians are maintaining the initiative. The town itself is still in german hands.Crimea.24. Operations against Sevastopol continue, but the situation there is described as satisfactory. On the Kerch Peninsula the Germans are said to bedigging in and they do not apparently intend to cross the Kerch Straits for thepresent.This situation may be due to the Russian pressure west of Rostov. It is also reported that certain German units in the Crimea have been replaced byRoumanians.......... ^       ....C onclusions.25. The picture to-day is distinctly heartening as there are definite pointersthat the serious situation which till now existed, especially on the Central Moscowfront, has been largely overcome by the Russians, and that the Germans maywell be forced to stabilise their front.In the South, the Russsian ability to follow up rapidly their initial successat Rostov has been a serious blow to the Germans, who have not been able to makeany counter-attacks up to the present.
Finally, the air situation is encouraging, for it appears that the russian air force has now gained superiority on most of the front, particularly in the moscow sector.Operations.Libya.26. Last week&apos;s Resume covered the period up to 2nd December. TheTobruk corridor had been cut and the bulk of our armoured and mobile forces had been withdrawn from the Sidi Rezegh area southward to the line of theTrigh el Abd to reorganise.Throughout 3rd December, the move eastward of enemy mixed columnscontinued while an Italian force was reported to be digging in about El Gobi,evidently with the object of securing a footing on the left flank of our mainarmoured force. These enemy forces were continually and effectively engagedby our mobile columns, which contained both field and anti-tank artillery.A New Zealand brigade fought a successful action against one of the enemycolumns west of Menastir, killing 100 Germans, capturing 100 Italians anddestroying 2 tanks.Throughout this period, in spite of very bad weather, concentrations of enemyvehicles and columns on the move were continually bombed by the R.A.F.General Auchinleck considered at this time that General Rommel may havebeen under the misapprehension that we had &quot; shot our bolt &quot; and that he was preparing to relieve his troops in the Halfaya area, before attempting to cut of four forces south of the Trigh el Abd. Plans were accordingly made to repeat theoperation wdiich had so nearly succeeded ten days before and again bring aboutthe junction of our main armoured force with the Tobruk garrison, with theobject of cutting off and ultimately destroying the remaining Axis armoured forces between Sidi Rezegh and the frontier. Owing, however, to the change inthe enemy&apos;s plan three days later, this project was not destined to be carried outin its original form.Operations on 4:th and 5th December.27. During the morning of 4th December the enemy attacked El Duda, thesouthern extremity of the Tobruk salient, from the West and South-East andwere repulsed with heavy losses. In the afternoon the attack was renewed andthe enemy succeeded in gaining a footing in the position, whence a counter-attack by infantry and &quot; I &quot; tanks failed to dislodge them.During the night, however, the lost ground was reoccupied and, by the morning of 5th December, the situation was completely restored. In theseengagements, 15 of our infantry tanks were destroyed or damaged, of which some have been recovered, while the enemy undoubtedly lost very heavily. Bythis time over 2,500 prisoners taken in recent engagements were held at Tobruk,of whom about 40 per cent, were Germans. It was estimated that these would bring the total of prisoners taken during the campaign to 8,000.Further South, an Indian infantry formation, in co-operation with cruisertanks, attacked the Italian force which had been established at El Gobi. Theenemy were driven out of their position with the loss of 15 tanks and 150mechanical transport vehicles. Four hundred prisoners were taken and55 thousand gallons of motor fuel destroyed. The enemy withdrew north-eastward but returned on the following day and launched an unsuccessfulcounter-atfack against the position held by our infantry North of El Gobi.Throughout the day, our mixed mobile columns and armoured cars were particularly active and successful in their operations against the enemy&apos;s forces on the Trigh-Capuzzo and in the Sidi Rezegh-El Adem area, where largenumbers of troops and vehicles were being concentrated.Operations on 6th December.28. On the previous day General Rommel seems to have decided that ouroffensive power was greater than he had supposed. He therefore abandoned hisplan to relieve his troops in the frontier area in favour of an attack upon the leftof our main armoured force.
By the morning of the 6th December, what remained of the Axis armoured forces were in the El Adem area.Early in the day, the 15th German Armoured Division advanced southwardstowards El Gobi, leaving the 21st Armoured Division and the remnants of theAriete Armoured Division just East of El Adem. A chain of anti-tank gun positions had, in the meantime, been established on the line El Adem-El Gobi.In the evening an attack on El Gobi was mounted but failed to develop.In the course of the operations against the various enemy armoured forces,23 Italian tanks and 100 M.T. vehicles were destroyed. In addition, a Germanbattery of artillery was annihilated, and General Neumann, the commander ofthe 15th Armoured Division, is reported to have been seriously wounded.Further North, the Tobruk garrison had reoccupied Sidi Rezegh and had joined hands with a force of armoured cars which had advanced from the South.Large quantities of enemy equipment were found abandoned and intact, as wellas part of the artillery which had been lost on the 1st December. In addition,700 wounded New Zealanders were found and evacuated.Patrols from Tobruk were pushed eastward and by nightfall they had gainedtouch with South African patrols moving westward from the Bardia area. Inthe course of the day these latter patrols had picked up a number of hungryGermans in the wadiis north-west of Bardia.Commenting on the day&apos;s operations, General Auchinleck telegraphed : &quot;it looks as if the enemy has decided to raise the siege of Tobruk and withdraw onGazala, but he is evidently prepared to fight on the line El Adem-El Gobi, eitherto cover his withdrawal, or possibly in the hope of still being able to deal us acrippling blow.&quot;Operations on 7th December.29. During the morning both German armoured divisions were located some10 miles west of El Gobi, where they were attacked by strong forces of tanks and infantry, supported by artillery, from the North-East, South-East and South-West.By midday seven of the enemy&apos;s tanks had been destroyed and steps werebeing taken to intercept the withdrawal westward of the remainder.During the night there were indications of a withdrawal north-westward ofall the Axis forces between El Adem and El Gobi. Orders were accordinglyissued for a general advance round the enemy&apos;s Southern and Western flankdirected on the El Adem-Acroma road. Meanwhile, the Tobruk garrisonlaunched simultaneous converging attacks on the enemy positions about El Adem.By the following morning troops from El Duda had reached a point 2 miles north of El Adem. The second attack, however, directed southwards from theoriginal perimeter East of the Tobruk-El Adem road, encountered very strong opposition and was brought to a standstill.Operations on 8th and 9th December.30. On the 8th December it became apparent that the enemy was fightinga delaying action round and south of El Adem to cover the westward withdrawal and reorganisation of his forces, which had originally been investing Tobruk.Throughout the day, Indian and South African formations advanced steadilynorth westwards against the enemy&apos;s Eastern flank, which was driven back to within 10 miles of El Adem. At the same time, mobile columns of all armsworked round the enemy&apos;s Southern flank and by the afternoon were some 20 miles north of Bir Hakeim. The enemy fought a stubborn rear-guard action,deploying some 50 tanks.On the 9th December, El Adem was occupied and some progress was made further West, while the pressure of our armoured forces and mixed columnsagainst the enemy&apos;s covering force and its rear echelons was maintained. Duringthe night, the enemy is believed to have withdrawn his remaining tanks, probablyamounting to about 40, Westward.At the time of writing, the enemy investing force West of Tobruk was stillstanding firm. An attempt on the afternoon of the 9th December, by the Polish-ongade Group, to drive back the enemy opposite the Medawer Salient gainedsome initial success, but failed to make further progress during the night.East of Tobruk and in the frontier area mopping up continues.[23249] &apos; &apos; c
Intelligence.Far East.36. It is possible that the Japanese strategical object is to seize theAmerican Islands in the Pacific, including Oaho, on which is the American base of Pearl Harbour. These attacks may be designed to ensure freedom of movement for the main military operations which are taking place in the area Thailand-Philippines-Borneo-Malaya.37. With regard to Russia, there are reliable indications that Japan wishes to maintain a correct neutrality, for it would not be in her interest to become involved in the North whilst her operations in the South are in progress.38. Japan will probably attempt to keep her campaign in China as quiet aspossible, but her interest in cutting the Burma Road must not be forgotten. Itdoes not seem likely, however, that the latter operation will be undertaken untilshe has achieved her strategic object in the South.Conclusions.31. The battle is not yet won, but we have regained tactical initiative and forced the enemy to withdraw in a state of considerable disorganisation. Tobnikhad been relieved and, but for Bardia and the two isolated strong points in thefrontier area, all the ground east of the line Tobruk-El Gobi has been cleared ofthe enemy.Far East.Malaya.32. On the 8th December the enemy made scattered landings in the KotaBahru area (N.E. Malaya) and infiltrated rapidly towards Kota Bahru aerodrome,against opposition from land and air forces. By nightfall 10th December the8th Indian Infantry Brigade in this area had been compelled to fall back to aposition 10 miles south of Kota Bahru, after destroying the aerodrome.Reinforcements of one battalion and one field battery arrived on the10th December.  Enemy forces in this area are now estimated at one division.During the night 9th/ 10th December an enemy landing from one transport was unsuccessfully attempted at Kuantan on the east coast. One battalion hasbeen sent to reinforce the 22nd Indian Infantry Brigade, which is holding theKuantan area.33. Simultaneously enemy landings estimated at two divisions took place at Singora, Patani and Nakawn Sri Tamarat in South Thailand. These divisionsmoved south wards across the Isthmus against the 11th Indian Division, which isholding the Kedah-Perlis frontier area (N.W. Malaya). Contact was establishedjust across the Thai border. Our troops, after inflicting casualties, are now with-drawing to prepared positions.Sarawak.34.   The Miri oilfield denial scheme has been completed.Hong Kong.35. On the 8th December the Japanese crossed the International Boundaryon broad front and our troops withdrew towards the inner (Gin Drinkers) lineaccording to plan.  All demolitions were successfully carried out.The enemy advanced in two formations along the Tai Po and Castle Peakroads. They have succeeded in capturing a redoubt slightly in advance of the inner defences. It is feared that a British platoon have become casualties. Theenemy suffered losses in his advance down Castle Peak road.The position appears to be consolidated for the time being with our troopsentrenched in the inner defences on the mainland.
Available Japanese Forces.39. At present Japanese forces in the South China area are distributed as follows : Indo-China-Central Thailand : 4 Divisions, 1 Mechanised Brigade.Southern Thailand-Malaya : 2 Divisions.Canton Area : 3 Divisions, 1 Tank Battalion.Hainan : 2 Divisions.Formosa : 3 Divisions, 1 Tank Battalion.The operations in South Thailand and Malaya can be supported by three orfour divisions from Hainan and Formosa, and in addition a further twelvedivisions from Central and Northern China and Japan can be made available for operations in the South or elsewhere. There are also indications that an expedition has been prepared in Japan for action either against the Philippinesor the Netherland East Indies. This expedition would not affect presentdispositions in the South, which, apart from those forces in the Canton area and north Indo-China, are probably directed against Malaya.40. The Japanese forces which invaded Thailand probably consisted of two divisions and a mechanised brigade. Advanced elements of these forces enteredBangkok at 1000 on the 9th December, 1941. These forces may now be used to reinforce the divisions attacking Northern Malaya.It is estimated that a force of approximately one division has landed in theSingora-Patani-Kota Bharu area, where it appears to be making some progress.Another division is reported to have landed at Nakawn Sri Tamarat. these divisions are probably the advance guard of a force to be concentrated in theSingora area for an attack on the West coast of Malaya as soon as preparationsare complete. There are also indications that part of another division has landed at Prachuab Khirikun.   This may constitute a threat to Mergui.It is possible that some of the divisions from Hainan and Formosa are now on their way South and may be used to carry out further operations on the east coast of Malaya.Western Pacific.41. Ocean Island and Nauru have been subjected to aerial bombardment,and Japanese have landed on the latter Island. Phosphate plants in both placeshave been demolished according to plan.Burma.42. The second flight of 16th Indian Infantry Brigade has left India forRangoon.AIR SITUATION.General Review.43. Operations against targets in Germany and occupied territory were again considerably restricted by bad weather, but several successful attacks weremade against enemy shipping in Home Waters.Enemy activity against this country remained at a low level.In Libya our day and night bombers contributed materially to the success ofour operations, and our fighters destroyed many enemy dive-bombers.We were compelled to abandon some of our aerodromes in Northern Malaya.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.44. Bomber Command despatched 20 sorties and Fighter Command flew228 sorties over occupied territory and against shipping. Attacks on shippingare reported under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;[23249] c 2
45. Spitfires made successful attacks on alcohol distilleries in northern france. At Houtteville four storage tanks were exploded and a large fire started,at Periers fires were started in the buildings and storage tanks, and at &quot;Vertonand Theitreville the still towers were set on fire. Spitfires also attacked thepower station at Dieppe, W/T buildings at Ushant, goods trains near Abbevilleand at Kermaria in Brittany, and landing grounds near Abbeville, wherebuildings were hit and two Me. 109s destroyed on the ground.46. Hampdens scored hits on the railway station and goods sheds atWittmund near Emden, and on the aerodromes at Gilze Rijen and Soesterbergin Holland.47. During these operations our fighters destroyed in combat five enemy aircraft and damaged four.  We lost 17 fighters.Night.48. Owing to continued bad weather, bombing operations were carried outon one night only, when 253 aircraft were despatched to attack industrial targets at Aachen, the naval base at Brest, and the docks at Ostend, Dunkirk, Calais andBoulogne. Two hundred and fifty tons of H.E. bombs and over 13,000 incendiaries were released.49. Aachen was attacked in very unfavourable weather by 69 aircraft, whichreleased nearly 80 tons of H.E. bombs and over 6,000 incendiaries. Observationof results was difficult but a factory was set on fire and bursts were seen in thetown.   Other targets in Western Germany were also attacked.Forty-three tons were dropped on naval targets at Brest. The usualsmoke screen made accurate pin-pointing difficult, but bombs were seen to fallon or near the enemy warships, and near the torpedo wharf.At Calais, where visibility was good, 34 tons were released. bursts were observed in the dock area and many large fires were started. Similar results were reported in the dock areas of Ostend, Dunkirk and Boulogne, on which atotal of 45 tons were dropped.50. Pamphlets were dropped in Holland, in the industrial centres ofNorthern France and in the Paris and Orleans areas.United Kingdom.51. Fighter Command flew 1,445 sorties by day and 361 sorties by night.German Air Force activity, which remained at a low level both by day and night,was generally confined to anti-shipping operations, though a few bombs were dropped in coastal areas.Coastal Operations.52. Coastal Command flew 165 patrols (309 sorties) and provided 29 convoy escorts (40 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Commandtotalled 370 (1,061 sorties).53. Hudsons and Beauforts made several successful attacks by day and night on enemy shipping, with the following results : Description.	Estimated Tonnage.	Locality.	Results.Merchant Vessel ...

54. In addition, a Hampden scored a hit on a tanker in the mouth of the Ems.Hurricane bombers hit a 300-ton trawler off Fecamp and set another small vesselon fire, and Spitfires attacked four small ships off Havre, leaving one of themlisting heavily.55.   Eight Hampdens laid mines off the Frisian Islands in daylight.56. The enemy made only one attack on shipping during the week. Theylaid mines off the East Coast on two nights of the week.Central Mediterranean.57. Wellingtons made two heavy attacks of over five hours&apos; duration onNaples, and dropped a total of nearly 40 tons of H.E. bombs and incendiaries. A4,000-lb. bomb burst in the torpedo factory and started a fire, which increased in intensity and was still burning when the last aircraft had left the target. Manykits were made on the Arsenal, on the I.M.A.M. airframe factory and in the dock and railway areas.58. Four Blenheims attacked the railway sidings at San Giovanni, wherea train of 24 petrol tankers was completely burnt out. Shipping was also bombed and machine-gunned. Beaufighters, patrolling in the vicinity of Pantellariaaerodrome to cover the arrival of delivery aircraft, shot down an Italian bomber.59. Night attacks were made on Malta on several nights of the week byformations of between 10 and 20 Ju. 88&apos;s operating from Sicily and probablybelonging to a German night-fighter unit. Some minor damage and a- fewcasualties were caused at Halfar aerodrome. Enemy daylight activity was negligible.Libya.Day Bomber Operations.60. Daylight bombing was maintained by Blenheims and mary lands on a heavy scale, except on the 5th and 10th, when severe sand and dust stormsprevented operations. During the earlier part of the period their attacks were directed against enemy tanks and transport in the Sidi Rezegh, El Adem andAcroma areas. On the Sidi Rezegh-Capuzzo road large fires and explosions were caused among about 700 vehicles, and in the El Adem area where five squadrons,with fighter escort, operated on the 6th, bombs were seen to fall among tanks andtank carriers which were loading at the time. A large building used as anA.A. post was demolished. Later in the week, with the object of dislocatingtraffic moving westward from the battle area, further attacks were made on M.T.near Acroma; a tank and many vehicles were destroyed and an extensive firebroke out. Hurricane bombers took part in these attacks, and destroyed 11vehicles.61. The aerodrome at Derna was twice attacked by a squadron of Marylandswhich destroyed at least ten aircraft on the ground, and shot down an Italianfighter. Two squadrons made individual attacks on Tmimi landing ground,where bombs fell among dispersed aircraft, and fires were started among M.T.62. Ships and stores at Bardia were also attacked, and a small merchant ship was probably sunk off Derna. A successful low-level attack was made onthe barracks at Horns, in Western Libya, by Blenheims from Malta.Night Bomber Operations.63. Wellingtons followed up these daylight attacks with heavy raids by night. On the 3rd-4th and following night a total of 72 tons of bombs was dropped on troops and transport in the El Adem area, and many violentexplosions and petrol fires resulted. Weather prevented operations on the night of the 5th-6th, but on the two subsequent nights strong forces attacked theEl Adem-Acroma-Gazala road, starting large fires in a bottle-neck near Gazala.Derna aerodrome and M.T. on nearby roads were attacked on the night of the8th-9th and following night. Naval Albacores released delayed-action bombs onthe dock area of Bardia, where a supply ship was reported to be unloading,thirty-six tons of bombs were dropped by Wellingtons from Malta on storesdepots west of Tripoli. (L.). At least six large buildings were destroyed andmany fires broke out, which merged into a large blaze visible from 80 miles away.
Fighter Operations.64. Our Hurricanes and Tomahawks patrolled the battle area, and intercepted many formations of Ju. 87s, escorted by German and Italian fightersoften forcing them to jettison their bombs. In the course of two days, the 4thand the 5th, 22 Ju 87s and 12 fighters were destroyed, 15 aircraft probably destroyed and 20 damaged; our losses were 11 fighters, with at least three pilotssafe.65. Hurricanes made several low-flying attacks in the Jedabya area,destroying four and damaging at least six aircraft. On the Jedabya-El Agheilaroad two staff cars, three road tankers and three large vehicles were alsodestroyed,, and 26 vehicles were damaged. Beaufighters and Blenheim fightersinflicted heavy damage on transport in the Marawa and Derna areas.Enemy Activity.66. The principal feature of the enemy&apos;s operations has been the high scale of effort reached by dive bombers and single-engined fighters, which have beenintensively engaged during the week. Twelve German fighters attacked three ofour landing grounds in the Maddalena area, causing a few casualties. They alsoshot down an empty ambulance aircraft which was taking off, and damaged a transport aircraft.The Far East.M alaya.67. Heavy enemy air attacks were made on our aerodromes in NorthernMalaya, where the enemy appears to have air superiority. Several of our fighters were destroyed on the ground, and we have withdrawn from the aerodromes atAlor Star, Kota Bahru, Sungei Patani and Kuantan.68. Singapore was attacked by enemy aircraft on the 7th and 9th December.Penang was bombed three times on the 10th, but little damage was done.69. On the night the 7th/8th, our aircraft attacked Japanese ships off thenorthern coast of Malaya, two of which were set on fire. On the 9th, elevenBlenheims bombed Singora aerodrome, where 40 bombers were seen on the ground.The results of the attack were unobserved.70. Nine of our aircraft are reported missing, and five Japanese aircraft were shot down over Northern Malaya.Hong Kong.71. The enemy has made spasmodic air raids on Kowloon and the aerodrome at Kai Tak, and on the south coast of Hong Kong Island. Some casualties wereinflicted on civilians and a lesser number on military personnel.Russia.72. Intensive operations by the Russian Air Force have accompanied theRussian successes and provide further evidence of the present German fighterweakness in Russia, due to withdrawals of units to Germany for refitting or for employment elsewhere. It is also likely that the intense cold recently experienced in Russia may have affected the servicing and operational readiness of aircraft to some extent, although this consideration does not appear to apply to theRussians, owing to their greater familiarity with operations under such condi-tions, and to the fact that their own aerodromes have not been within the battlezones.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By day.73. The only incidents occurred at South lighthouse, Fair Isle, in the shetlands, which was bombed and machine-gunned on the 8th and 10th December.Slight damage was caused.By night.74. Bombing was confined to the nights the 7th-8th and the 8th-9th, mostlyon the North-East coast.Damage.75. On the 7th-8th at Grimsby the fish docks, a fish merchant&apos;s store and houses were damaged by I.Bs., some of an explosive type.76. On the 8th-9th private property was damaged at Whitley Bay,Monkseaton, Newcastle and Pelaw. At South Shields the river jetty was damaged and a ship under construction slightly damaged. In Kent railwayservice was temporarily suspended between Ashford and Wye.Casualties.77. Estimated casualties for the period ending 0600 Wednesday, the10th December, are 18 killed and 15 injured.
