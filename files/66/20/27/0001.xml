BRIDGES.Secretary.Great George Street, S.W.1. ,22nd December, 1941.OUTWARD TELEGRAM(CYPHER)FROM FOREIGN OFFICE TO WASHINGTONNo. 7127. D: 12.40 a.m. December 21st, 1941,December 20th, 1941.IMPORTANT.    MOST SECRET.1,      The President is likely to raise with you themachinery for Allied co-ordination.      I therefore send you theprovisional views of War Cabinet.2.      Higher Direction of Allied War Effort.,The broad policy for the conduct of the war mustbe decided on the highest level.   &apos; Speed of the war calls for rapid decisions, which can only be x^reached by: directconsultation between the executive heads of the countriesdirectly concerned.      Occasional conferences of all Alliesand Dominions will no doubt be useful to deal with general issues of principle.      But the formal establishment now ofa Supreme War Council in permanent session would raiseambarrassing questions as to who should be represented on it?and in any case would not work.

3c      The Dominions. The position of the Dominions calls for special consideration.      There are clear indications thatthe Dominion Governments, especially Australia, will expect tobe brought more fully than in the past into any machinery setup for the higher direction of the war,      We think that,  sofar as possible, co-ordination between the Dominions should beeffected here,      This might involve some form of representation in London at a higher level than at present.      This will,of course, involve consultation with the Dominion Governments.There may also be occasions on which one or more of theDominic.is should have representation on bodies set up to dealwith regional or specific questions.      (The observation inthis last sentence may be applicable to the smaller allies).The position of India will have to be looked atseparately^,4a      Military Co-ordination,,i It is not the purpose of this telegram to deal with military co-ordination, which we know is very much in yourthoughts.,      Obviously strategy of war must be looked at as awhole and can only be planned and considered on highest level(see &quot;paragraph 2).      Presumably these high level discussions would assign to a particular power the predominant role in a given set of operations.      That power would then have completeoperational responsibility even though provision of somey of theresources required might lie with some other power.      Thissystem differs, of course, fundamentally from the arbitraryallocation of areas of strategic responsibility on ageographical basis which would seem to have many dangerousfeatures.50      Utilisation of Allied Resources,Here again we feel that it would be best to avoid,at any rate at first,  establishment of formal Allied co-ordinating bodies, and to proceed by way of the develoiomentand adaptation of existing liaison missions and Committees andtheir extension to cover other subjects, as and when necessary.It would also be unwise at this stage to take any finaldecision as to the country to be regarded as central point for consultations on whole or part of this fieldo6,      But we attach the utmost importance to strengtheningin every possible way the existing system,      In particular, we hope that all British Missions in Washington, and all UnitedStates Missions in London,  civil and military alike, will beplaced under the direction of a single head who can spealcwith authority on behalf of his Government,      We are thinkingin terms of someone of ministerial standing, responsible &quot;tohis Government as a whole, but v/ithout derogating from theposition of the Ambassador,7.      It would also be of assistance if the United states could appoint to London in the immediate future representativesauthorised to enter into definite engagements on behalf ofthe competent United States agencies on such questions asJ shipping, food,  raw materials,  oil, and on questions ofIexport policy, such as the sirpply of nanufactured goods,^[/(including essential civilian needs) required to maintain^the - .I war effort of the Empire and of the smaller Alliesc      If such( representatives were appointed, we should be only too glad&apos; to take them to the very fullest degree into our confidence.For instance, an American representative already attends the meetings of the Tanker Advisory Committee, and a proposal that the United States shoiild have a representative at meetings of the Oil Control Board has already been put forward.

So      A number of bipartite Committees with Representativesof this country on the one hand and of various Allies (not including the United States) already sit in London and control the allocation and use of shipping of the Governments concerned.The existence of these arrangements, which work smoothly andsuccessfully;    our close relationship with, continental maritimecountries and their ship owners, and the experience we have gained during the last two years, all make it very desirable tomaintain this machinery on this side cf the Atlantic.      the seat of Government of the smaller Allies is in London, and inmany cases shipping is their main contribution to the war effort.      Moreover, the shipping problems which arise fromthe programmes of imports, both military and civil, for theMiddle East, Persian Gulf, and this country., as well as theshipping obligations of current and prospective militaryoperations,  cannot be adequately resolved else- -here than inLondon, where the programmes are constructed-.      this consideration applies equally to the planning of loadingprogrammes and to the day to clay adjustments which have tobe made-.      Any change,  especially in the near future, mustlead to grave disturbances and most adversely affect the plans for current operations,,9.,      In fields of raw materials,, food and oil, the needsof this country and of the other areas for which the UnitedKingdom Government are responsible,  are so extensive and socomplicated that in present circumstances  the programmesmust be constructed in London.      Moreover, though there mustbe consultations on these programmes both in Washington and inLondon, questions of shipping priority are fundamental to thempand can only be decided at the centre from which the shipping to carry them is controlledc10-j    Production of War Material,The planning of war production programmes (heD whattype of munitions each country should concentrate onproducing) may in due course have to be centred in Washington.^But at the moment our production is at least as great as thatof the United States of America, and we should avoid taking decisions now which would lead to disturbance of our programmes,just as they are getting into full swingo      The movementacross the Atlantic of the centre of gravity on these mattersis, no doubt,   inevitable, but it should be gradual.lie    The allocation of finished munitions must bedetermined on broad strategic groundsc      The arrangements forthis will therefore largely depend on those for military co-operation-ordination (see paragraph 4 above)0      We should not atpresent like to commit ourselves to the view that suchallocations should necessarily be made in Washington^12 o    CommunicationscThe pressure on transatlantic communications,already causing serious delays, will be intensified by^ourcloser relations with the United States of America.      perhaps the most valuable contribution towards better Angle--american co-ordination would be an improvement in air communications.This cannot be achieved unless the United States can provideaircraft with the necessary range and carrying capacity0

13.    Union of Soviet Socialist Hcpuhlicst,  The above iswritten mainly in terms of the United States of Americaand this country, but the same principles would seem to be applicable to the spheres in which co-operation with theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics can be arrangedo(IVDTV)
