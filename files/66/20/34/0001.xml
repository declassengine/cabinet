COMBINED OPERATIONS.Norway.1. On the 27th December a successful raid was carried out oh the norwegian coast. The raid was directed mainly against enemy shipping anchored offVaagso, an island situated in latitude 620 North.Light forces of the Home Fleet arrived off Vaagso Island at 0830, just before daylight, and, under cover of a smoke screen laid by Hampden aircraft of Bomber Command, the Military Forces, consisting of Commandos and. someNorwegian troops, were landed ten minutes later in naval assault landing craft.Coast defence batteries, manned by Germans, opened fire on our ships, but were silenced by bombardment from the warships and bombing by Hampdenaircraft of Bomber Command. The latter also machine-gunned the batteries andnearby barracks on Ragsundo Island.There were two main military landings, one on the small island of Maaloyand the other at the south-western extremity of the town of South Vaagso.The entire garrison of Maaloy were either killed or taken prisoner, and militarystore houses and ammunition dumps were blown up. A battery of four gunswas destroyed.At South Vaagso the Germans put up a stiff resistance, and in the streetfighting we suffered some casualties before the town could be brought completelyunder our control. An enemy tank was put out of action and oil cisterns andammunition stores were destroyed. A wireless station, and certain industrialplant, owned by a Quisling and known to. be operating for the Germans, were destroyed.A total of eight enemy ships, including five merchant vessels, two armed trawlers and one armed tug, totalling 15,650 tons, were destroyed. The merchantvessels beached themselves to avoid capture and were destroyed by our naval forces; the armed vessels were sunk.An offensive patrol in conjunction with this operation was carried out byBlenheim aircraft of Bomber Command. They attacked a convoy of enemy merchant ships off Egersund. Many bombs fell among them and.one ship was sunk.While the operations were taking place at Vaagso, Blenheim aircraft of bomber Command were attacking Herdla,. near Bergen, the nearest enemyaerodrome, 100 miles down the coast. Direct hits from a height of 250 feet were obtained on the wooden runways of this aerodrome and an M.E. 109 was destroyed.The huts and wireless station nearby were machine-gunned. From all theseBomber Command operations eight of our aircraft are missing, but one memberof a Hampden crew was rescued.The damage to the Herdla runways undoubtedly reduced the scale of air attack on our ships, which were protected by a fighter escort of Beaufighters andBlenheims of Coastal Command. During a series of combats, which preventedany successful attack being made on our ships, three H.E. lll&apos;s were destroyed and one H.E. 111 was probably destroyed.   Three of our fighters are missing.Our ships suffered only very minor damage and all returned fit forimmediate service.Our casualties were slight. Over 120 Germans were killed, and 95 german naval and military prisoners and 9 Quislings have been brought back.The entire operation went according to plan and all objectives were attainedwithin the time allowed, all forces withdrawing at 1445.naval SITUATION,General Review.2. Light forces of the Home Fleet took part in the Combined Operationsdescribed in paragraph 1, and also in an operation in the Lofoten Islands.H.M. Submarine H. 31 has been lost in Home Waters. Two German U-boatshave been sunk in the Eastern Mediterranean.Shipping losses have been light.
Home Waters and North Atlantic.3. While the above Combined Operation was taking place anotheroperation extending over several days was carried out in the Lofoten Islandswhich resulted in the temporary disorganisation of the enemy&apos;a sea communica-tions in this important area. One of the harbours in the vicinity was used asa fuelling base during the operations, and landings were made by one ofour Commandos and Norwegian troops at four different points on Moskenes,where 27 German prisoners, two Quislings and 266 Norwegian refugees, includingwomen and children, were taken off. Our forces were constantly reconnoitred by enemy aircraft, but we suffered no damage or casualties. A German patrol vessel was sunk and one enemy aircraft was shot down.H.M. Submarine H. 31 is overdue from patrol and must be considered lost.An enemy aircraft which ineffectively attacked a coastal convoy off Hartie-pool on the 27th was shot down by the fire of the convoy escort and anotheraircraft was damaged.The Spanish s.s. El Condacla (3,472 tons) has been intercepted by H.M.Trawler Alouette and sent to Gibraltar under armed guard.North America.4. On the 24th December Admiral Muselier reported that he had landedon the Islands of St. Pierre-Miquelon on orders from General de Gaulle and hadreceived an enthusiastic reception.Mediterranean.5. Between the 12th and 22nd H.M. Submarine Torbay shelled and sankfive enemy schooners off Suda Bay and Methoni (S.W. Greece). She also torpedoedan Italian destroyer inside Navarin Harbour on the 23rd.H.M. Corvette Salvia has not reported since picking up survivors from thes.s. Shuntien (torpedoed off Tobruk on the 23rd) and must be considered lost.At Haifa, on the 24thr the British tanker Phenix (5,907 tons) was burnt out.The fire spread to the Norwegian tanker Vilja (6,672 tons) which was damaged,but her tanks are intact.A convoy, escorted by cruisers and destroyers, arrived at Alexandria from malta on the 29th, having lost one ship (s.s. Volo, 1,587 tons) which was sunk by -Boat on the 28th. Attacks by enemy aircraft were driven off by naval aircraft.One torpedo bomber was shot down for the loss of one Martlet.On the 30th H.M. Gunboat A phis successfully engaged two enemy coastaldefence guns in the vicinity of Bardia.During the week upward of 2,300 tons of French shipping passed Gibraltareastbound and 10,000 tons westbound.Benghazi.The Northern Mole at Benghazi has been blown up in many places and theCentral Mole blocked by sunken ships. The Southern Mole is intact for 1,300 feetfrom the base and the bridge between the town and the Southern Mole isdemolished, but pontoons are available; there are no lighters or cranes.Far East.Pacific.6. Submarines of the United States Asiatic Fleet claim to have sunk twotransports and probably a third, also one minesweeper and a supply ship.South China Sea.7. The Netherlands Submarine K. 14 has sunk three large transports and a tanker off Sarawak. A Japanese destroyer of the Amagiri class (1928, 1,700 tons,six 5-inch) has also been sunk by a Netherlands submarine.The Netherlands Submarine K. 17 is overdue from patrol and must beconsidered lost.awaii.8. The American destroyer Drayton claims to have destroyed a JapaneseU-Boat south of Oahu on the night of 24th/25th.
Anti-Submarine Operations.9. On the 23rcl H.M. Destroyers Hasty and Hotspur sank a German U-boatto north-east of Bardia and 3 officers and 40 ratings were taken prisoner. Onthe 28th a German U-boat was sunk by H.M. Destroyer Kipling to north-east ofMersa Matruh, 2 officers and 28 ratings being taken prisoner. Aircraft claimeda hit in an attack to the northward of Tobruk, and two other attacks were madeby aircraft in the Eastern Mediterranean without definite result.Enemy Intelligence.Main Units.10.   There is no change in the position of German and Italian main units.Italy.11. No convoy has got through from Italy to Libya during the week, but three small ships and three Lighters have been sighted at Ras-el-Ali (26 miles west of El Agheila) apparently landing supplies at a temporary jetty.U-boats.12. Activity of U-boats in the Eastern Mediterranean has continued. Theyhave operated chiefly on the routes of supply from Alexandria to ports in cyrenaica, but patrols have probably also been maintained in the JEgean southof the Dardanelles, as a Russian tanker has been reported torpedoed in that area.There has been no activity in the South Atlantic and little evidence of movements in the North Atlantic, though latest reports indicate a possible recrudescence of activity in this area.Far East.13.   There is no known change in the disposition of the Japanese fleet.TheJapanese claim to have captured 50 Allied merchant vessels of a total tonnageof 130,000, but this has not yet been verified.The American Asiatic Fleet has left Manila.Japanese Naval Claims and Losses.14.

Enemy destroyers stood half a mile out to sea,supported three and a half miles beyond by a line of cruisers&apos; and battleships
Two groups of transports, with an aircraft carrier between them, lay betweenthe cruisers and destroyers. The landing force was embarked in 50 landing craft,each holding about 150 men and armed with one or two machine guns. the landing craft then made for the shore in line on a five-mile front, whilst the beaches were shelled and air support provided by aircraft from the carriers.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.15. Tavo ships were sunk by U-boats in the Eastern Mediterranean and a russian tanker is reported torpedoed and sunk in the ^gean. A homeward-bound tanker was torpedoed in the North-West Approaches on the 31st.Shipping off the East Coast was attacked on three days by enemy aircraft,one ship being sunk and one damaged; a Dutch ship was also damaged in the st. Geo.rge&apos;s Channel.One ship was mined and sunk off Yarmouth.In the Far East a Russian ship was bombed off the Philippines and a smallAmerican ship was bombed and sunk at Manila.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. During the week ending the 31st December, 840 ships, including207 Allied and 28 Neutral, were convoyed. Two anti-aircraft ships, 55 destroyers(including 15 United States destroyers) and&apos; 83 sloops, corvettes and mine-sweepers were employed on escort duties.Imports into the United Kingdom during the week ending the 27th Decembertotalled 841,000 tons, compared with 890,000 during the previous seven days, andan average of 947,000 tons during the past ten weeks. Of this amount226,000 tons were oil of various grades.British Minelaying.17. There have been no minelaying operations by surface craft in the past week, and only slight minelaying by aircraft in the North Sea and Baltic. Inthe Mediterranean minelaying operations by aircraft were carried out on foursuccessive nights off the coast of Libya.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.18. Mines were laid by enemy aircraft in the Thames Estuary on three nights and on one night between the Tyne and Yarmouth.Forty-three magnetic and nine acoustic mines have been detonated duringthe week, twenty-two of them in the Humber and its Approaches, eleven in theYarmouth War Channels, nine in the Barrow Deep, and four in the AldeburghWar Channel.The mine totals, including those dealt with in Foreign Waters, are now1,688 magnetic, 1,218 acoustic, and 1,068 contact.Foreign Waters.There is evidence of a minefield of moored German mines about twenty to twenty-five miles north-eastward of Tripoli. Another minefield is suspected closeoff the Libyan coast about 30 miles to the east of Tobruk.During the evening of the day on which Benghazi was occupied by allied forces, enemy aircraft dropped twelve mines, eleven of them outside the harbour and one on the mole. Two have since exploded spontaneously. Minesweepers havesailed from Tobruk to sweep a channel into the harbour.Enemy minefields are suspected off Navarino and in the approach to theGulf of Athens.Four magnetic, two acoustic and four moored mines were swept off Malta.Three magnetic mines and one moored mine have also been detonated off Tobruk.The United States authorities have established searched channels for new york and Casco Bay, Maine, and declared a mined area in Chesapeake Bay.
Enemy Merchant Shipping.Northern Waters.19. During November the number of enemy ships of over 1,000 tons whichpassed through the Straits of Dover were two Eastbound and three Westbound,all of them by night.The Bay of Biscay.The German s.s. Joao Pessoa, 3,203 tons, arrived at Bilbao and the Italians.s. Eugenio C, 4,078 tons, arrived at Castro Urdiales on the 25th December to load iron ore.The tanker which was beached off the Spanish coast after being attacked by our aircraft, as reported in last week&apos;s Resume, is believed to be the Norwegiantanker Ole Jacob, 8,306 tons, which was captured by a raider in the Indian Oceanin November 1940 and re-named Benno.The Mediterranean.Six German ships, a total of 24,000 tons, have been reported trading betweenSpain and France since the 20th December.The Ketty, a Greek schooner, arrived at Tobruk with enemy cargo on the19th December and was seized in prize.Eight Greek ships, totalling 22,828 tons, which were sunk during operations in Greek waters last April have now been raised and seized in prize by the enemy.The Indian Ocean.There are three German ships and one Italian in Goa, Portuguese Indies,the s.s. Braunfels, 7,847 tons, s.s. Drachenfels, 6,342 tons, s.s. Ehrenfels,7,752 tons, and the s.s. Anfora, 5,452 tons.The A atlantic.The German tanker Germania, 9,851 tons, which is at Teneriffe, is reportedto be taking in oil.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Leningrad Sector.20. South-west of Tikhvin the Russian attack continues, and has made some progress in the direction of Lyuban.Central Sector.21. The Russians have advanced along practically the whole front fromKalinin to Tim. North-west and west of Moscow the Germans have again been forced back, while to the south-west the Russians have started to attack in theNarofominsk area. West and south of Tula the Germans have been forced tomake considerable withdrawals (in some cases 60-70 miles). Further South theRussians are threatening Kursk from the North-East and East.Ukraine.22. In the Donetz Basin the Russian offensive has made little progress.There is no change in the position on the River Iviius.Crimea.23. The German and Roumanian attack on Sevastopol still continues, but so far has been unsuccessful. The Russians have succeeded in landing at two points on the Kerch Peninsula.
Conclusions.24. The Russians still retain the initiative, and the pace of their advanceshows no signs of slackening. On the contrary, the long German withdrawal inthe Tula area has been followed up with extreme rapidity. There is still no indication as to when and where the Germans will be able to stabilise their front.Libya.25. Last week&apos;s Resume covered the period up to the capture of Benghazion the 24th December. Extensive demolitions had been carried out by the enemy in the harbour area and all the lighters and cranes had been removed or destroyed. Some wharves were, however, still usable and the power station wasundamaged. Isolated detachments of the two Italian infantry divisions were still being rounded up north of Benghazi, but surviving elements and whatremained of the two motorised divisions had succeeded in making their way southtowards Jedabya.a 26. During the operations prior to the capture of Benghazi, our motorised&apos; forces captured a large number of prisoners, but found it expedient, afterdisarming them, to leave them to be collected and evacuated later. During thenext three days heavy rains delayed all movement and the progress of the forcesadvancing towards Jedabya, where it was apparent that General Rommel was preparing to make a determined stand, was slow.27. By the 26th December, however, our forward troops were in contact with the enemy. A small force of motorised infantry and artillery was in actionsome 15 miles north of Jedabya and a force of about 70 tanks ^ from the7th Armoured Division was endeavouring to advance round the enemy&apos;s southernflank. General Rommel appears to have concentrated the bulk of his availabletanks, numbering about 60, to counter the latter movement, which threatened hislines of communication. Engagements between our own and the enemy&apos;s tankssouth-east of Jedabya continued for three days, so far without decisive results.Up to the 29th December, however, the balance of tank casualties seems to havebeen in our favour. For instance, on the 28th December 22 enemy tanks were destroyed and about 20 damaged, while only 14 of our own were lost.28. . No details have yet been received of the operations on the 30th December,but tank casualties on both sides are believed to have been heavy.29. In the Frontier area, an assault on Bardia began at 0500 on the31st December after three hours&apos; air and artillery preparation. Details of the attack are not yet available. The enemy continues to hold out in the Half ay aposition.The Far East.Malaya.30. In the North-East our rearguard which is covering the withdrawalalong the railway from Kelantan has had minor encounters. Small parties ofthe enemy have moved south&apos; by the coast road towards Kuantan, where theyare in contact with our forces. Part of our forces in this area are withdrawingwest of the Kuantan River.31. In the North-West the withdrawal of the 11th Indian Division has been successfully completed and all bridges across the Perak River were demolished.Our troops are now in contact with the enemy about Kampar, 20 miles southof Ipoh. A concentration of 250 small craft, including 50 barges, was reported at Georgetown (Penang) on the 27th December, and 800 M.T. were reported tobe on the polo ground on the 30th December.32. The estimated Japanese strength in the Malaya theatre is nowfive divisions and one tank regiment.Burma.. 33. An unsuccessful attempt to dislodge the Japanese from Bokpyin onthe coast, midway between Victoria Point and Mergui, was made on the27th December.   We suffered some casualties and a further attack was about to
AIR SITUATION.General Review.43. On two nights our bombers carried out heavy attacks on targets inGermany and occupied territory. Unfavourable weather prevented offensive operations on the remaining five nights. A daylight raid was made against the scharnhorst and Gneisenau at Brest.In Libya our air forces concentrated their attacks on military objectives in the Jedabya and Bardia areas.Enemy attacks on Malta increased. In Malaya a considerable proportionof the enemy effort was directed against rail communications and aerodromes.be staged, when it was learnt that the Japanese had evacuated the place on the night 28th/29th December. It was occupied by our troops on the morning ofthe 30th December.34. In the raid on Rangoon on the 23rd December casualties amounted to approximately 1,000 dead and 700 injured. There was a large exodus of labour from the city, which largely accounts for the small number of casualties-50-caused by the raid on Christmas Day. Labour is now returning and work hasbeen resumed in the docks.Hong Kong.35. The Governor, on the advice of his Naval and Military Commanders,capitulated on the 25th December.  No news has been received since that time.Thailand.36. The situation in Thailand is at present quiet, and there have been norecent indications that an attack on Burma is imminent. There has, however,been some movement of Thai forces towards the Thai-Burma frontier.Borneo and Sarawak.37. The Japanese have occupied Kuching after a series of air raids on thetown. Oil denial schemes have been put into operation and successfullycompleted. There has been no communication from Sarawak since the25th December.38. Elements of the 2/15 Punjabs from Kuching have arrived at Sinkawang,on the coast of North-West Dutch Borneo.Philippines.39. The Japanese have increased their pressure in Luzon and havereinforced their landings. The United States commander considerably shortenedhis front by withdrawing towards Manila, which was declared an open city onthe 26th December, and was heavily bombed on the 27th December.40. All possible reinforcements are being sent from other Philippinegarrisons to Mindanao, where a landing by Japanese troops at Davao was reported on the 26th December.Intelligence.France.41. The number of German divisions in France is still estimated to be 24,of which only two are south of the R. Gironde.Bulgaria.42. ^Numerous rumours are in circulation of the passage of!German troops to Bulgaria, but although a number of long-term preparations have been put inhand, there is no concrete evidence whatever that the Germans are massingtroops on the Turkish frontier. The total number of German divisions in the balkans still remains at 13.
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.44. Bomber Command despatched 45, and Fighter Command 211, offensive sorties.   Attacks on shipping are reported under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;45. On the 30th, Flalifaxes bombed the battle cruisers at Brest, dropping58 tons of H.E. bombs. Visibility was good and the usual smoke-screens did not come into operation until the end of the attack, but the effectiveness of the bombingcould not be assessed, as evasive action was necessitated by the intensity andextreme accuracy of the anti-aircraft fire encountered. All our bombers were hit.Very effective cover was provided by nine squadrons of Spitfires, which destroyedsix enemy fighters, probably destroyed six more and damaged five. In addition,our bombers destroyed one enemy fighter, probably destroyed another and damaged a third. We lost three Spitfires and three Halifaxes, but our air/sea rescueservice picked up six members of the crew of one Halifax, who liad been located50 miles north of Brest by aircraft search.Night.46. Bomber Command despatched 424 sorties, compared with 185 last week.A total of 410 tons of H.E. bombs (including 10 of 4,000 lbs. and 33 of 2,000 lbs.)and 27,400 incendiaries were dropped. Dusseldorf and Wilhelmshaven were theprincipal targets on the two nights when operations were possible.47. The heaviest attack of the week was against Dusseldorf, upon which96 aircraft dropped 112 tons of H.E. bombs (including three of 4,000 lbs.) and11,000 incendiaries; rail centres and docks were reported to have been straddled,a bridge is believed to have been hit, and many large fires were started in the city.48. Wilhelmshaven was raided by 74 aircraft, which dropped a total of77 tons of H.E. bombs and 6,660 incendiaries. Bomb-bursts followed by fires were seen in the centre of the town, across the docks and near the main railway station.49. The rubber and chemical works at Huls (four miles north-west ofKrefeld), was raided by 65 aircraft. Bright moonlight and snow facilitatedidentification of the target area, where many fires were started. The 55 tons ofH.E. bombs released included 19 of 2,000 lbs.50. Fifty-two tons of H.E. bombs were dropped on Emden, and five bombsof 4,000 lbs. were observed to burst among buildings beside the Binnen Hafen,on the railway dock and in the old town.51. Boulogne and Brest were raided on a lighter scale, and a number of secondary targets were also bombed.*United Kingdom.52.   Fighter Command flew 1,322 sorties by day and 206 sorties by night.53. On the night of 29th/30th a moderate attack was made on the Newcastlearea, but, apart from this, enemy operations over this country were on a verysmall scale. Two night bombers were destroyed during the week, one by fighters and one by A. A. fire.Coastal Operations.54. Coastal Command flew 189 patrols (254 sorties) and provided 23 convoy escorts (59 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols by fighter command totalled 336 (1,000 sorties).55. Hudsons and Beauforts made several attacks on enemy shipping. A5,000-ton merchant vessel off Texel was hit amidships and another, of the sametonnage, is believed to have been damaged. In the course of a raid on La Pallicea tanker was probably hit, but the results of attacks on other shipping in the portwere not observed.56. The enemy made a daylight raid on shipping off the Faroes on the 25th.Attacks on shipping were reported off Hartlepool on two nights and off Aberdeenand Harwich on another. Minelaying was carried out on three nights in the thames Estuary, and in the Tyneside area on one night.
Mediterranean.Cyrenaica.57. During the week our air forces have concentrated their attacks on enemytransport and military targets in the Jedabya area. Fifteen Wellingtons made an attack on the night of 24th/25th December on M.T. convoys near El Agheila.On the three following days Hurricanes machine-gunned M.T., A.F.V.S and artillery south-east of Jedabya, Blenheims attacked M.T. on the road west of thetown, and Tomahawks attacked transport between Jedabya and El Agheila; twopetrol lorries and many vehicles were destroyed and more than 50 vehiclesdamaged. On the 28th, reconnaissance aircraft reported three concentrations of enemy M.T., each of 1,000 vehicles, in the area between Jedabya anda point 25 miles to the south, and another group of 500 M.T. was observed movingsouth-east.58. About 20 enemy aircraft on Jedabya landing ground were attacked by four squadrons of Blenheims, and direct hits were made on two of them; twoconcentrations of about 100 vehicles were also effectively bombed. On the30th December two Blenheim squadrons with fighter escort bombed 30 tanks and about 200 M.T. attacking our ground forces south-east of Jedabya; direct hits were made on troop-carrying vehicles, one tank was set on fire, and very heavy damage was inflicted on the M.T. On the following day 15 tanks with M.T. were attacked and two tanks were hit.59. At Bardia, for four days preparatory to, and during, an assault byground forces, Blenheims heavily attacked enemy gun positions, M.T. and pillboxes inside the perimeter, and obtained many direct hits. A reconnaissance to locate a boat in Bardia harbour resulted in the boat being sunk by artillery fire.60. The withdrawal of enemy air, units from Cyrenaica to Tripolitania was completed during the week, but the Italians are believed to have extricated notmore than half their aircraft. There was very little enemy activity over the mainbattle61. Long-range bombers, probably operating from Greece, laid mines inBenghazi harbour, and made occasional single raids on aerodromes at Derna andEl Gazala.Tripolitania.62. On three nights of the week Tripoli (L) was bombed by a total of30 Wellingtons from Malta; airect hits were observed on the main quay and onthe railway stations, and two hits and one near miss were made on shipping. in another raid, seven Wellingtons bombed barracks and M.T. sheds at Misurataand machine-gunned aircraft on the ground. Naval aircraft laid mines outsidethe harbours of Tripoli (L) and Zuara.63. In daylight raids, Blenheims successfully bombed a minesweeper offTripoli (L), and made a direct hit on a vessel in Zuara harbour. This vessel blewup with^ a terrific explosion, possibly damaging the mole. Many successful attacks were also made on transport vehicles between Tripoli (L) and Misurata,and between Tripoli (L) and Zuara.Malta.64. Enemy activity over Malta was considerably increased. Attacks weremade every day and every night, the night attacks generally lasting throughoutthe hours of darkness. Small forces of Ju. 88s. were normally employed. Noimportant damage resulted.65. In daylight, small formations of Ju. 88s., heavily escorted by italian and German fighters, attacked the Grand Harbour, and Luqa and Takaliaerodromes. During the raid on Luqa on the 26th December five of our bombers and one fighter were destroyed on the ground, and four bombers and onefighter damaged; further aircraft were damaged in subsequent raids.
66. Hurricanes intercepted the attackers whenever possible, and sometimesdrove them off before any bombs were dropped; nine enemy aircraft were destroyed (three by A.A.) and four others probably destroyed. Seven Hurricaneswere shot down, but two pilots were saved.Greece and Crete.67. A force of Wellingtons was despatched to attack the Greek Naval base at Salamis and oil installations at Piraeus. Owing to bad weather only three aircraft succeeded in reaching the targets, and eight others bombed the aerodrome at Heraklion (Crete) and Suda Bay. On the night of 30th/31st December the attack was repeated, and ten Wellingtons bombed Salamis, hits being obtained on the submarine base and a munition factory; three other aircraft started alarge fire among oil tanks at Piraeus and caused explosions at a chemical factory.Supplies were dropped in southern Greece for British troops still at liberty.Russia.German A ir Force Operations against Russia.68. The main centre of German Air Force activity during the past weekhas been in the Crimea, where close support forces have been engaged on a heavyscale in the attack on Sevastopol. It is thought, however, that the Russian landingoperations in the Kerch peninsula may to some extent have diverted the maineffort of air attack away from Sevastopol. Long-range bombers, have also operatedagainst shipping in the Sevastopol69. The concentration of effort in the Crimea has left only a small force which can be employed against Russian pressure on the remainder of the southern front, but some attempt has been made to interrupt Russian communications,especially railways, in this70. On the Moscow front, low-level attacks have been made againstadvancing Russian columns, but these appear to have occurred only in isolatedareas; the forces at the disposal of the German Air Force, particularly close-support units, are at present inadequate to maintain a scale of effort likely tointerfere seriously with the Russian advance, which is receiving considerable support from the Russian Air Force.71. There is no evidence that any operations of an important nature havebeen carried out in the northern sector.The Far East.Malaya.72. The initial scale of effort directed against Malaya, which during theopening days of the Japanese attack was in the neighbourhood of 100 sorties daily,has fallen to between 30 and 40 sorties daily. Nevertheless, the number of aircraft at Patani, Sungei Patani, Kota Bahru and Singora, the principal aerodromes in operational use against Malaya, has been considerably increased since aboutthe 22nd December.73. On the 25th, Japanese aircraft maintained continuous attacks on rail communications at Segamat (95 miles N.W. of Singapore) and, on the following-day, similar targets were bombed at Tampin (18 miles N. of Malacca) wherethe railway was cut, Kuala Lumpur, where only slight damage resulted,Tanjong Malim (36 miles NN.W. of Kuala Lumpur), Seremban (33 miles.S.E. of Kuala Lumpur) and at Tapah (30 miles S.S.E. of Ipoh).74. On the 28th, pill-boxes at Kuantan were ineffectively bombed and machine-gunned, and at Port Swettenham enemy aircraft sank a tug and damaged a wharf and a train.75. On the following day aerodromes at Kluang (50 miles N. of Singapore)and Kuantan were bombed; little damage resulted at the former and none at thelatter. A total of 30 aircraft was engaged in three attacks on Singapore Island,but caused no damage of consequence.
76. On the 30th Kuala Lumpur and Port Swettenham were attacked, anda runway (since repaired) and petrol dump at Tengah aerodrome were hit. Therailway and adjoining buildings at Kuala Lipis were hit, and some damage wassustained by civilian property at Jerantut (27 miles S.E. of Kuala Lipis). Atrain was hit at Betong (10 miles N.W. of Kuala Lipis). In the evening,Singapore Naval base and A.A. gun positions in south Johore were raided.77. Apart from numerous reconnaissances, our main activity took place onthe night 27th/28th, when six Blenheims bombed Sungei Patani aerodrome, where130 enemy aircraft had been observed. Subsequent photographic reconnaissancedisclosed that seven enemy fighters had been destroyed and five fighters and threebombers damaged on the&apos; ground. This aerodrome was again bombed, by fourBlenheims, on the following night and by two Catalinas on the night 30th/31st.Burma.78. On the 25th, Rangoon was raided by 82 Japanese bombers escorted by30 fighters. The aerodrome at Mingaladon (50 miles N.N.W. of Rangoon) wasalso attacked. Over 20 enemy aircraft Were shot down. We lost four fighters,while the American Volunteer Group lost two. Only slight damage resulted from the raid.Borneo.79. Singkawang was bombed on the 25th by approximately 25 heavy bombers. The aerodrome at Kuching (now in Japanese hands) was put out of usebefore evacuation. Slight enemy air activity over Labuan (120 miles N.E. of Miri)on the 26th, was reported.Philippines.80. Apart from the bombing of Manila, the main weight of Japanese air activity has been in direct support of ground operations. Practically no information is available on the size of the effort operating against the philippines, other than that the raids delivered against Manila on the 27th and28th December were carried out by 30 to 40 aircraft, and 26 aircraft respectively.The land-based aircraft operating against the Philippines from Formosa, Basco,Vigan, Aparri and Legaspi, are thought to number only about 250, but assistancemay now be forthcoming from the aircraft in the Canton area, which, since thefall of Hong Kong, will have been to a large extent liberated. It is also probablethat the Philippine operations are having a greater measure of support fromship-borne aircraft than those being carried out in Malaya.Other operations by Japanese Aircraft.81. In addition to the above operations the Japanese have been extending the area of their activities so Widely as to include Kunming in South China,Medan in Sumatra, Minehasa in the Celebes and Serong in Dutch New Guinea.The last two, it is assumed, were undertaken by ship-borne aircraft. The attackon Kunming on the 20th. in which ten bombers operated, was intercepted by aircraft of the American Volunteer Group which shot down four. The attack onMedan on the 28th, originally and wrongly reported as accompanied by paratroops,was made by 17 bombers, thought to have been operating from the Malayanfrontier.Apart from a report which states that Wake Island was bombed by 17land-based heavy bombers on the. 20th, there is no information of air activities in the Pacific during the week.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.82. No bombs were dropped on land during daylight, but houses and theCoastguard Station at Fairlignt were machine-gunned on two consecutive days.
By Night.83. On the night of the 29th/30th December, raiding was considerably-heavier than of late. While the majority of bombs fell on Newcastle and the surrounding districts, others were scattered in Durham and Yorkshire, and as farafield as Roxburghshire, Cumberland, Lancashire, Lincolnshire and Leicester-shire. Damage, which was nowhere extensive, was confined to private property.The only other incident was on the night of the 27th/ 28th December, when a single aircraft bombed Scarborough, causing superficial damage.Casualties.84. Estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours, Wednesday-day, the 31st December, are 10 killed and 26 seriously injured.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. in combining the figures for non-tankers (which are compiled as at the end of the month) with those for tankers (which are compiled as at the 15th of the month) certainslight differences have had to be brought into a common form.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom iu November 1941 ; these comprised 51 tankers of 385,000 gross tons.(b) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A substantial part of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage, e.g., to the middle east (see note (3)).   In recent months the proportion of this tonnage which did no importing to the United Kingdom (Armed Merchant Cruisers, RoyalFleet Auxiliaries, Hospital Ships, &amp;c.) has amounted to rather more than one-half.(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair.   They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eire.
