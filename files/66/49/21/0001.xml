. - fTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  April 1944.W.P. (44) 221.24.th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.INDIAN MINISTER AT WASHINGTON.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.SINCE the end of 1941 an Agent-General of the Government of India hasbeen stationed in Washington. He is attached to the Embassy, with the localdiplomatic rank of Minister. Sir Girja Shankar Bajpai has held the post since it was created.2. When Sir Girja was appointed it was laid down in his instructions thatthe Agent-General should normally not deal with the United States Governmentin regard to political matters, which were to continue to be handled through diplomatic channels. In March 1942, however, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadorreported that, as developments in the Far East had greatly increased the numberof political questions arising between the Government of India and the. UnitedStates, he had encouraged Sir G. Bajpai to handle these questions-direct withthe State Department, with the result that he had come to occupy a positionsimilar to that of the Dominion Ministers in Washington. Lord Halifaxsuggested that the Agency-General should be made into an independent Missionheaded by a Minister. He urged that it was of the greatest importance that the agent-General should be freed from the suspicion fostered by certain circles inAmerica that in his arguments and exposition of conditions in India the Agent-General simply echoed the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government.3. Lord Linlithgow, however, was strongly opposed to the proposal mainly on the broad ground of principle, that the change would not accord with theconstitutional fact that His Majesty&apos;s Government are responsible for India&apos;external relations, and that, as India can have no foreign policy of her own, itwould not be proper and might not be safe for her to have her own independentdiplomatic representatives. In view of Lord Linlithgow&apos;s objections we did not feel able to proceed with the proposal, but in consultation with the present Viceroywe have had the matter examined afresh; and the Government of India now recommended that the change should be made. We realise that there are objections,which may be briefly stated as follows : The establishment of diplomatic status while ultimate responsibility rests with His Majesty&apos;s Government may (a) even with a well-understood conventiondefining the allocation of business trench on the responsibility of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, (b) lead to a demand for reciprocal American representation in.Delhi, and for the exchange of diplomatic representatives with other countries,(c) attract criticism on the ground that the change of name does not imply realresponsibility, and possibly foster an agitation for the appointment of a non-official as Indian Minister.4. The Government of India, however, consider that these arguments are entirely outweighed by the importance of taking steps now to place India on theworld stage, at least, as a Dominion with an independent diplomatic voice. Intheir view it is better to take the present opportunity to train Indian diplomatists&quot;under British guidance and to direct Indian thought from its present introverttendencies towards foreign affairs, than to be rushed at a later stage, whenconventions between His Majesty&apos;s Government and India will be more difficultto establish; and if increasing demands for the exchange of diplomatic representatives have to be conceded, Indian representation in the diplomatic field[27298]CONFIDENTIAL. Copy No.     ^6
will increase Indian self-respect. They believe that these considerations outweighdifficulties of procedure and co-ordination.5. We are in complete agreement with the Viceroy and his Government.We do not under-estimate the force of the objections, which bear a strongresemblance to those urged against Dominion representation between 1920 and1926, and we do not deny that there is a considerable difference between theposition of Canada at that time and the present position of India. Moreover, wewould agree that the strength of the case for separate representation for canadian  the early 1920&apos;s was that there were many questions between the Dominion andthe United States which could be more easily settled direct than by reference to &quot;HisMajesty&apos;s Government. It cannot be claimed, we think, that questions of purelyIndian interest, capable of settlement by direct consultations between the Govern-ment of India and the Government of the United States, are as numerous as werequestions of purely Canadian interest. But there are some, and the number islikely to increase.6. We attach as an Appendix to this Memorandum a set of instructions on which the Government of India propose that an Indian Minister should work. This Directive contemplates what appears to us to be a logical threefolddivision of the responsibilities in relation to India of His Majesty&apos;s ambassador and the Minister (a) purely Indian matters with which the Minister will deal;(b) borderline oases with which he will deal in consultation with the ambassador; and(c) wider questions which must be dealt with by the Ambassador.The arrangement by which the Minister will repeat to the India Office thereports which he makes to the Government of India on any matters&apos; save thoseof purely Indian domestic concern will ensure that His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave the opportunity to intervene on any occasion when this may be necessary.7. It will be observed that the Minister is to be accredited for India andnot merely British India. We feel that this is the wisest solution, for theconstitutional niceties of India&apos;s position are not widely appreciated in theUnited States, and the State Department might be inclined to make difficulties over accepting a Minister expressly accredited for British India in the fear that they might lay themselves open to criticism for countenancing in some waythe partition of India. This will mean that the Indian Minister will beresponsible for handling matters which arise from the exercise of the functionsof the Crown Representative, for example, the protection of the subjects ofIndian States. To give him the necessary authority for this, we propose thatthere should be a standing instruction from His Majesty&apos;s Government to theMinister to accept as approved also for the States, and States&apos; subjects (IndianBritish protected persons), instructions from the Government of India expressed as concurred in by the Crown Representative. We feel that there might be some difficulty however in authorising an Indian Minister to handle personalmatters affecting Indian Rulers and their families, such as may arise forinstance, on the occasion of a visit to the United States by an Indian Ruler,and we would propose that there should be an arrangement between theMinister and His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador that the latter should for the presentcontinue to deal with such cases. The Viceroy and the Government of Indiaagree with these proposals, and we have incorporated instructions accordinglyin the Directive.8. The question of publicity presents special features in view of the factthat publicity about India and on behalf of the Government of India and publicity about the British record in, and policy towards, India, must inevitably be closely interwoven though the broad division of responsibility for these functionsrests respectively with the Agent-General and the Embassy (and BritishInformation Services). Following a special enquiry it was recently agreed bythe India Office, Foreign Office, Ministry of Information and Government ofIndia that, notwithstanding the notional delimitation of spheres of responsibility,the most intimate co-operation and the maximum of harmonisation between the embassy (and British Information Services) and the Agent-General are inpractice required.   This is now firmly established.
9. It is not only in regard to publicity that a precise definition of therespective responsibilities of the Ambassador and Minister is difficult; and we agree with the Government of India that a more exact delimitation of theMinisters sphere of action than that attempted in the Directive must be leftto the evolution of conventions agreed to by him and the &quot;Ambassador. As wehave said, Lord Halifax has already encouraged Sir Girja Bajpai to handlecertain political questions and Sir Girja has signed the United NationsDeclaration on behalf of India, represented that country at Hot Springs and onU.N.R.R.A., held conversations in regard to Indian disabilities under the AsiaticExclusion Act, and taken part on behalf of India in discussions about reciprocalLease/Lend. As our colleagues are aware, India was a signatory to the Treatyof Versailles and was an independent member of the League of Nations fromits inception. The step now proposed seems to us a logical development in herevolution. It is in fact on the broad consideration that the time has come toencourage India to play a more definitely independent part in the sphere ofinternational relations that we commend to our colleagues the proposal that an indian Minister independent of the Embassy should be accredited by His majesty o represent India in the United States of America.24*A April, 1944.L.
