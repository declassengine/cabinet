IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 242.4:th May, 1944.ECONOMIC POLICY TOWARDS TURKEY.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.IN reply to British and American representations on the subject of Turkishexports of strategic value to the enemy, the Turkish Government assured us thatthey would do &quot; everything within the limits of their material possibilities &quot; tocomply with our wishes. The embargo on the export of chrome to the Axisfollowed almost at once, while as regards other commodities the Minister forForeign Affairs said that he was aiming at reducing Turkish exports to germany by 50 per cent, of the 1943 totals; no contracts with the Germans coveringTurkish products would be signed unless certified as essential by the Ministry forForeign Affairs; and, in any case, none but Government contracts would beconsidered essential.2. The question now arises whether we should ask the Turks for further assistance and, if so, how we should present our request.3. Apart from chrome, the principal Turkish exports to the Axis in 1943were &apos;Metric Tons.Cotton          ............... 10&apos;351Cotton waste ...       ...       ... 1,554Mohair         ............... 1,438Skins.........-     .........- 2,894Copper         ...      ......... 7,384Pig iron        ............... 9,508Iron and steel ingots        ......      --. 966Oilseeds        ......      ......... 17,924Vegetable Oils        ............ 2,068Dried Fruits ...      ...      .....- 6,945Tanning Materials............ 25,859Fish.................. 17,9164. The quantities are so small compared with German needs that even animmediate embargo on all these goods would have no appreciable effect on germany&apos;s military power of resistance this year. But some are major Germandeficiencies and where, as in the case of cotton, Germany has practically noreserves, every little counts.5. We could exercise considerable economic pressure on Turkey by cutting off supplies which she cannot obtain from the Axis, such as wool, cotton, jute,electrolytic copper, tin and tinplate, rubber, hides, coffee, Copper sulphate, andferro-alloys. Indeed we have already made a beginning on these lines by suspend-ing the export of manufactured copper to Turkey until she lets us have equivalentamounts of blister; and raw wool and cotton piece-goods until the Turks stopexporting woollen rags and raw cotton to the Axis.6. There are other measures we could take such as blacklisting certain important firms, which has been most successful in Switzerland.7. The Turkish harvest of 1943 was better than the average, and a threat to cut off food supplies from overseas would not be effective. Nor would a threat to cut off the small quantity of oil (97,000&quot; tons in 1943) which Turkey obtainsfrom the Allies.--L O/WAR CABINET.[27417]
28. It would not in my opinion be worth while to embark upon an attempt toprevent Axis purchases in Turkey by buying on behalf of the Allies the wholeoutput of certain commodities. Such an attempt would be most expensive andprobably ineffective. Except by cutting the lines of communication we cannothope to stop all Turkish trade with the Axis.9. I recommend that for the moment we concentrate on obtaining an embargo on the export to the Axis of the most important remaining Turkishsupplies (cotton, mohair, skins and copper). I suggest that the easiest andquickest way of achieving this aim would be to negotiate immediately an agree-ment whereby we and the Americans undertake to supply certain goods and to buy certain Turkish products in return for the additional embargoes we desire.Meanwhile, we would maintain and, if necessary, add to our present exportprohibitions. In order to save time we have asked our Ambassador at Angorafor his views on this suggestion.S.Ministry of Economic Warfare, W. 1,tth May, 1944.
