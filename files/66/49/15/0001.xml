NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. The floating dock at. Bergen has been attacked by one of H.M. midgetsubmarines.An explosion in the Bombay docks has caused serious losses to shipping and damage to port- facilities.Carrier-borne aircraft have successfully attacked Sabang.Two U-boats have been sunk and one probably sunk.Home and Norwegian Waters.2. A convoy from North Russia, consisting of 38 ships, arrived in home waters without loss.3. On the 14th, one of H.M. midget submarines attacked the floating dockat Bergen with depth charges. When nine miles away on her return to base,heavy explosions were heard. The dock was used by E-boats and U-boats. Onthe following day H.M. S/M Venturer attacked two ships escorted by four A/Strawlers off Egersund (S.W. Norway). The result of the attack was not observedbut a heavy explosion was heard.Mediterranean. &apos;4. During the week ending the 18th, over 19,500 tons of supplies wereunloaded at Anzio. On the 12th, H.M. destroyer Undine bombarded enemy positions in the Anzio area.On the night of the 11th/12th, N.E. of Algiers, the U.S. destroyer Holder,escorting an eastbound convoy, was torpedoed during an unsuccessful attack by aircraft on the convoy.   She was towed into port.5. In the Adriatic, on the night of the 11th/12th, Allied coastaTforces sank a convoy of six small craft off Murter Island (Yugoslavia) and H.M. destroyersshelled Gruz and searchlight positions on Lokrum Island (near Dubrovnik).Three nights later our coastal forces sank a small tanker in tow of a tug and captured a lighter off Murter Island.   Seven Italian prisoners were taken.6. In the iEgean, H.M. S/M Ultimatum sank two caiques off Crete on the10th, and coastal forces sank a small ship off Kos on the night of the 16th/17th.Owing to the disaffection in ships of the Greek fleet at Alexandria it hasbeen necessary to retain certain of HM. ships in the port, and the number of available escorts has been appreciably reduced.East Indies.7. On the 14th, the British s.s. Fort Stikine (7,142 tons), loaded with cotton and T.N.T., blew up in the Victoria dock at Bombay. There were two separateexplosions and large fires broke out in the Princes and Victoria docks. H.M. ships, Jalapadma (motor transport ship) and El Hind (L.S.I.) and H.M.I.S. Padmavati(L.N.D. vessel); a dredger and some 40 lighters were destroyed and it is feared that about 13 cargo ships, totalling some 60,000 tons, will be a total loss. Inaddition, H.M.S. Braganza (base ship) and at least four other cargo ships were damaged. Extensive fires broke out among godowns and about 45,000 tons of grain were destroyed. The number of dead is not yet known, but casualties are estimated to exceed 1,200 injured. On the 17th, three ships discharged 865 tonsof cargo in the Alexandria dock, which was undamaged. &apos;8. On the morning of the 19th, carrier-borne aircraft from H.M.S.Illustrious and the U.S.S. Saratoga, covered by the Eastern Fleet, carried out. anattack on Sabang in northern Sumatra. Forty-seven fighters and 38 bombers were flown off, and 30 tons of bombs were dropped in the port and on Lhongaairfield. . Two Japanese destroyer escorts and two cai-go ships were seriously damaged and an oil fuel cistern was left burning. Many hits were made on the dockyard, barracks, W/T, radar and power stations, and hangars and 22 aircraft were destroyed on the airfield. One Hellcat was shot down but the pilot wasrescued by H.M. S/M Tactician under fire from shore batteries. Three enemytorpedo bombers subsequently approached the Fleet aud were all shot down by fighters.///
Pacific.9. On the 11th, U.S. forces occupied Hulungau Island (Admiralty Islands)without opposition. On the night of 13th/14th, Allied M.T.Bs. sank four and damaged two barges in Wide Bay (New Britain).On the night of 12th/13th, Allied M.T.Bs. and gunboats shelled enemy positions on the south-east shores of Bougainville and destroyed an ammunitiondump. On the 16th a U.S. destroyer shelled enemy positions in Empress AugustaBay (Bougainville).Anti-Submarine Operations.10. Thirty-five attacks have been reported, of which 16 were made by surface craft, 11 by carrier-borne aircraft and eight by shore-based aircraft.On the 14th H.M.S. Pelican (sloop) and H.M.C.S. Swansea (frigate) sank aU-boat west of Cape Finisterre. Four officers and 37 ratings were takenprisoners. On the 16th the U.S. destroyers Candy, Joyce and Peterson, escortingan eastbound U.S. convoy, sank a U-boat 150 miles E. of New York. Eightprisoners were taken. A Canadian Catalina probably sank a U-boat SW. of iceland (C) on the 17th.Enemy Intelligence.U-boats.11. The North Atlantic remains quiet and there are fewer U-boatsoperating.Enemy Attack on Shipping.12. U-boats are reported to have attacked three ships of which two are known to have sunk. A tanker, in an eastbound U.S. convoy, was sunk offNantucket Island. In an eastbound Mediterranean convoy, two ships were torpedoed off Derna; one was sunk and the other abandoned and on fire. two ships were damaged by mines off Naples, one of which was beached and the otherreturned to harbour.Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ending the 16th, 824 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 263 were in ocean convoys and 561 in British coastal convoys. Two escort-carriers, 65 destroyers (including 24 U.S. destroyers) and106 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Seven homeward-bound convoys, consisting of 191 ships, and two outward-bound convoys, consisting of 72 ships, reached their destinations. Two ships ina homeward-bound convoy were sunk by U-boat.Allied Minelaying.14. Mines have been laid by ships and aircraft off the Frisian Islands, theFrench coast and Biscay ports.Aircraft laid mines in the Danube and in the iEgean Sea. In the Far East,aircraft laid mines off the China coast and in rivers in Burma.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.15. On one night of the week E-boats were suspected of minelaying off theEast and South Coasts.The mine totals are : 4,745 ground and 4,524 moored.Enemy mines were located off Casablanca on the 10th.On the 15th, during a raid on Anzio by ten enemy aircraft, minelaying tookplace and ten mines were subsequently destroyed.In the Adriatic seven mines were destroyed between Dubrovnik and Split.Between the 14th February and the 10th April, 120 mines have been destroyed in the western approaches to the Strait of Bonifacio.Enemy Merchant Shipping.16. Photographic evidence in the three months November, December and January last shows slightly greater activity in merchant shipbuilding in Germany,mainly owing to the resumption of work on many vessels whose completion had[27315] B
been long delayed. The &apos;&apos; Hansa &apos;&apos; programme appears to be proceeding at thesame level with five ships completed and five laid down in the period concerned.Other ships completed include a Sperrbrecher, a large cargo ship, two coasters,a trawler and a ferry.In the occupied countries 14 corvettes are completed or nearing completion.17. It is estimated that about 60,000 tons of iron ore have been shipped from Spain to west French ports during March, an increase of about 24,000 tonsover the figure for February.During the week, over 20 of the smaller ships and three of the larger ships were reported to have entered or cleared from Bilbao.18. It was reported on the 18th that the Rumanian ships Basarabia andTransilvatnia, both of 6,672 tons, which had been at Istanbul since June 1941,had been ordered by the German authorities to proceed to Sebastopol. When,however, they were ready to put to sea, Turkish police guards were placed onbeard each ship and essential parts of the machinery were removed.The German tanker Claudia (3,741 tons) entered the Dardanelles on the 14thbound for the Black Sea, and the German tanker Bertha (1,810 tons) passedIstanbul and entered the ^aegean on the 16th.Black Sea Intelligence.19. The enemy sea-going tonnage in the Black Sea amounts to only about12 ships totalling 30,000 tons. Besides these there is a large number of small&quot;craft.Russian submarines and light craft are operating in the western Black sea on the Crimean route. On the night of the 5th/6th, Russian M.T.Bs. damagedan R-boat off Odessa and sank an F-lighter off Almechet on the 9th. On the 12th,Russian light craft sank an F-lighter and anM.L. off Cape Tarkhan (W. Crimea).Between the 10th and 14th, Russian aircraft are reported to have sunk three cargo ships, two E-boats, four M.Ls. and ten F-lighters.MILITARY SITUATION,The Russo-German Campaign.     (An outline map is included as an inset.)N-orthern and Central Sectors.20. In spite of further German reports of defensive successes south of Pskovand east of Ostrov, there is still no confirmation from the Russians of any majoractivity in these areas.Tarnopol-Stanislavov Sector.21. The resistance of the German garrison at Tarnopol has. now come toan end. It had been surrounded for some days, and although the Germans claim that some parts of it escaped, it seems evident that a large proportion was destroyed or captured.As a result of the German attacks between Tarnopol and Stanislavov thefront line now runs roughly southwards from Tarnopol to the Dniester. this represents an appreciable gain of ground for the Germans, and at one time there seemed a slight possibility that they might press the Russians fur/ther back andso threaten the Russian forces between Stanislavov and the Carpathians. Russiancounter-attacks, however, have already regained a little of the lost ground, andalthough the Germans claim to have made some progress east and south ofStanislavov, the Russians appear to have the situation well in hand.Stanislavov-Ribnitsa Sector.22. Apart from a very slight Russian advance west of Jassy there has been no change of position in this sector. ...Lower Dniester Sector.23. The Germans have completed&apos; their withdrawal across the LowerDniester, and the Russians have already established bridgeheads across the riverin the Tighina area.
Crimea.24. Sweeping on across the Crimea, the Russians have now hemmed theGermans and Rumanians into the extreme south-western corner of the peninsula,where the enemy now hold only Sebastopol and its immediate neighbourhood.In their rapid retreat the enemy must have suffered heavy losses both in men andequipment. It is not yet clear what proportion of the original forces have succeeded in reaching Sebastopol. The town is within the range of Russianartillery, and as the Russians now have the use of the Crimean airfields, it isalso likely to be heavily bombed from the air.General.25. Along most of the front conditions have been quieter than in previousweeks and the most outstanding events have been in the Crimea. Here interestnow centres in Sebastopol, where the Russians held out for so long againstpowerful German attacks in 1942.It is, however, also of importance that the Russians have apparently been ableto check German progress between Tarnopol and Stanislavov and have themselvescaptured Tarnopol after a stubborn resistance by the German garrison.Italy.26. The week has seen increasing activity, particularly in the bridgeheadwhere there have been two successful raids carried out by U.S. troops. enemy attacks, directed against the sectors held by British troops to the west of the perimeter have been repulsed. On the main front regrouping has continued andour patrols and artillery have continued to be active.Main Front.27. In the Adriatic sector the enemy has twice again distributed leafletsby artillery. One patrol by our troops penetrated as far as Mount Amaro (10 miles .W. of Lama) on the 16th, and a number of other raids have been carried cut.On the 19th, 16 prisoners were captured during a raid by our troops on buildings close to Arielli. On the same night a strong enemy raid was directed against our positions near Orsogna.The situation is quiet in the Cassino area. - British tanks shelled enemypetrol dumps six miles south of Cassino, causing large fires on the 19th. On thesouthern sector of the main front French artillery destroyed an enemy ammunitiondump four miles north of Minterno on the 18th.Bridgehead.28. In addition to normal patrolling, U.S. troops have carried out twosuccessful raids. The first was directed against two strong points three miles.W. of Littoria. Sixty-one prisoners were captured for the loss of two tankson mines and one man wounded. On the same night a patrol by U.S. troops blewup an enemy dump of small arms ammunition three miles east of Carroceto. Thesecond raid was directed against some buildings three miles N.W. of Littoriaon the 18th. We suffered no casualties; eight prisoners were captured. Duringthe afternoon and evening of the 18th enemy raids, which were repulsed, developedacross the River Moletta against British positions. These raids were laterfollowed by two small attacks of about company strength which were also repulsedwith heavy casualties to the enemy.Yugoslavia.29. Reports received during the past week show that heavy fighting is con-tinuing in four main areas. In addition, sabotage and interference with enemy communications have been carried out.In Croatia fierce engagements have taken place in the Bihac area.In Bosnia a further German thrust towards Mrkonjicgrad has been repulsed by the Partisans.In Serbia the Partisan offensive has resulted in fierce fighting west and S.W.of Kraljevo.In Montenegro continued action by Marshal Tito&apos;s forces-aimed at gainingcontrol of road and rail communications to the coast has achieved further success in the Cetinje area.[27315] b 2
Greece.Resistance.30. A German drive in Northern Morea started in the Patras area on the12th.   It appears to be directed upon Kalavryta.There have been reports of two minor engagements between E.L.A.S. forces and the Germans in Western Macedonia. Three German trains have been destroyed by E.L.A.S. action.Civil War.31. On the 17th, 1,000 E.L.A.S. troops were stated to be closing in onE.K.K.A. bands north of Naupactus.On the 14th, an E.L.A.S. force of similar size attacked Zervas troops N.E. ofAmphilochia (25 miles south of Arta).Burma.Arakan.32. There has been an intensification of Japanese activity near theMaungdaw-Buthidaung road, and N.W. of Buthidaung. Several enemy attacks on our positions S.W. of Buthidaung have been repulsed.In the Kaladan Valley, activity has been restricted to patrolling.Chin Hills and C hind win.33. On the 16th, the Japanese made a heavy attack upon our positions onthe Imphal-Tamu road. Our troops were forced to withdraw, but enemy casualties were severe. Further attacks in this area were repulsed. Eight miles.E. of Imphal, an enemy counter-attack has been repulsed.Twelve miles east of Palel, our forces attacked and occupied an enemyposition, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy in so doing. West of Palel,attacks have been launched upon our positions, without success.About ten miles north and N.E. of Imphal there has been fighting and our troops have made a little progress along the road to Ukhrul. During the last few days there have been reports of considerable enemy patrol activity in thearea 12, and 14 miles N.W. of Imphal.Eighteen miles west of the Impbal-Tiddim road the Japanese have destroyeda bridge on the track leading to Silchar.Kohima-Dimapur A rea.34. Moving from Dimapur, our troops have attacked and cleared the roadblock ten miles N.W. of Kohima.The Japanese are reported to have penetrated our forward positions west of Kohima, but no details are, as yet, available.Long-Range Penetration Groups.35. Our L.R.P.Gs. continue to harry enemy lines of communication inCentra] Burma by demolition and ambush.Pacific.New Guinea.36. Australian forces from the Ramu Valley have entered Bogadjim andhave made contact with the American forces advancing along .the coast fromSaidor:   In its later stages, the Australian advance was unopposed.Admiralty Islands.37. Organised Japanese opposition in the Admiralty Islands has nowceased. &apos; ,Solomons.; r 38. On the Torokina perimeter, there has been minor activity only.Japanese shell-fire has caused some damage on one of the American airfieldsinside the perimeter.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.39. The scale of .effort from this country reached its peak between dawn onthe 18th and dusk the following day, during which period 6,400 bomber and fighter sorties were flown in operations directed mainly against the german aircraft industry and against the railway system and Military Objectives inFrance.   Five thousand tons of bombs were dropped.One attack of moderate strength was made on London.The Mediterranean Allied Air Forces flew 13,175 sorties. In Italy, successful attacks were made on bridges and railway communications. Heavy attacks weremade on railway centres and other targets in Rumania, Yugoslavia, Hungary and bulgaria.United Kingdom.40. On the night 18th/19th, about 90 long-range bombers crossed our coastin the Cromer area and made a sharp attack on London, which was reached by themajority of the raiders; ten other aircraft carried out intruder operations overLincolnshire and are believed to have shot down three of our bombers. On two other nights, harassing attacks were made over S.E. England by a total of 27fighter bombers. Fourteen enemy aircraft were destroyed, including two byAA. fire.In daylight, two enemy reconnaissance aircraft were reported in the Isle of wight area, one of which was shot down.Home Waters.41. Minelaying operations by aircraft of Bomber Command, four of whichare missing, resulted in the laying of 597 sea-mines by 190 aircraft.In attacks on convoys off the Frisian Islands, Beaufighters sank two armed trawlers and severely damaged a third and a small ship.Two Mosquitoes despatched to patrol Copenhagen shot down four Ju. 52equipped with mine detonating rings and destroyed three enemy aircraft on theground.   On another day, a Mosquito shot down two enemy aircraft off Denmark.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.42. On the 13th, 18th and 19th, Fortresses and Liberators, operating ingreat strength and heavily supported by fighters, concentrated on the destructionof aircraft factories, ball-bearing works, aircraft assembly pools and airfields inGermany. A total of more than 4,000 tons of bombs was dropped on these and similar targets, among which were the following  Augsburg (469 tons) ;* Oranienburg (382 tons); Cassel (324 tons); Rathenow(314 tons); Schweinfurt (306 tons); Lippstadt (257 tons); Werl (252 tons);Paderborn (237 tons); Lechfeld (221 tons) ;* Brandenburg (190 tons); Oberpfaffen-hofen (133 tons); Luneburg (124 tons) ;* Eschwege (113 tons) and Gutersloh(101 tons).Sixty-three heavy bombers and 16 fighters did not return from these opera-tions, on which 2,186 bomber and 2,556 fighter sorties were flown. In combat,78 enemy aircraft were destroyed by fighters, 10 probably destroyed and20 damaged on. the ground, 50 more were destroyed and 34 damaged.Military Objectives in Northern France were bombed by Liberators and by medium and fighter-bombers; approximately 600 tons were released. We lost oneSpitfire bomber and one Liberator. Escorted medium bombers, two of which are missing, dropped 415 tons on coastal gun-positions at Dieppe, Havre, Fecamp andNieuport and attacked the rail centres at Malines (226 tons) and Namur (123 tons).On the 15th, during sweeps, in difficult weather conditions, by 623 long-rangeU.S. fighters (33 missing) over North and Central German airfields, 18 enemy aircraft were shot down and 40 destroyed on the ground.&quot;Night.43. On the night 18th/19th, a total of 824 Lancasters, Halifaxes andMosquitoes was despatched.   Their task was the disruption of railway facilities* Vide Appendix VII.
at Eouen and Tergnier and in the Paris area. Very powerful and well-concentrated attacks were delivered by 798 aircraft in good weather. the heaviest weight (1,524 tons) fell at the Sotteville marshalling yards, Rouen, mthe direct water and rail route between Paris and Havre-Dieppe. Nearly700 tons were dropped on the railway centre at Tergnier,* 110 miles N.E. of paris. The marshalling yards at Juvisy* and Noisy-le-Sec, both on the easternoutskirts of Paris, received 1,129 and 710 tons of bombs respectively. From these operations, 11 bombers did not return, three were shot down over England byhostile &quot; intruders &quot; and one crashed.Mosquitoes, in two attacks on Berlin, dropped 53 tons.

In all operational theatres covered by the Mediterranean Allied AirForces up to 18th April, Allied aircraft fleiv a record total of 13,175 sorties forthe loss of 99 aircraft; 167 enemy aircraft were shot down.Italy.45. The main weight of the Allied attack was concentrated on railway communications with a heavy scale of effort directed against bridges.Fighter-bombers took a prominent part in the attacks on road and railway bridges and railroad tracks; their operations were extensive and widespread, full advantage being taken of the weak enemy fighter opposition. Successful attacks were made in the areas of Rome, Sulmona, Orte, Perugia, Arezzo and Florence.A total of 23 bridges were hit, six were probably hit and seven suffered damage to the approaches. Railway centres were also attacked in the Rome area, in central Italy^and near Florence, and damage was caused to tracks and rolling-stock, and main lines were cut. Further operations carried out againsttransportation targets resulted in the destruction of, or damage to, 208 M/Tvehicles, eight trains and 15/20 oil wagons. An attack was made on Viterboairfield by 74 Mitchells with excellent results, the target being well covered. Inthe Udine area, airfields were attacked by escorted Lightnings, 11 enemy aircraftbeing destroyed on the ground and six shot down in combat; four Alliedfighters are missing.Enemy long-range bombers maintained fairly sustained operations by night,but always on a low scale. Ju. 88 based in Northern Italy carried out occasionalharassing attacks on the bridgehead, and laid mines off Nettuno and in NaplesHarbour.Yugoslavia, Albania and Greece.46. Two heavy attacks were made on the Belgrade/Zemun airfield by atotal of 178 heavy bombers; hangars said grounded aircraft were hit. Savarailway centre was bombed by 125 Fortresses, and smaller forces attacked theBelgrade/Rogosarkski and Ikarus aircraft factories with good results. Fromthese operations four Allied bombers and two fighters are missing and three enemy fighters were shot down. On the night 12th/13th, 22 Wellingtons and11 Liberators dropped mines in the Danube between Budapest and Belgrade anda tanker was set on fire.Formations of about 36 Fortresses attacked a cement factory and the harbour at Split and the railway centres at Brod and Nis; the targets were well covered.A total of 138 sorties were flown by Spitfires on offensive reconnaissances;69 M/T vehicles, eight locomotives and nine schooners were destroyed or damaged and two oil barges were set on fire.   Two Spitfires and one Fortress are missing.Hungary.47. An attack was made on Gyor airfield and Gepgyar aircraft assemblyworks by 163 Fortresses, on Budapest/Ferihegy Vecsis airfield by 121. Liberators,on Budapest/Tokol airfield by 124 Liberators and on Duna Repulogepyar air-craft components factory (6 miles S. of Budapest) by 93 Liberators. These raids were well executed and the targets effectively covered; at least 44 aircraft* Vide Appendix VII.
on the ground were destroyed or damaged, and in the air enemy opposition was encountered resulting in 40 enemy aircraft being shot down for the loss of16 Allied bombers and three fighters.By night, a total of 102 Wellingtons dropped 140 tons of bombs on theBudapest marshalling yards; two Wellingtons are missing:Bulgaria.48. The railway centre at Sofia was bombed by 251 Liberators which dropped 426 tons of bombs; the target was well covered. Plovdiv marshalling yards were attacked at night by Wellingtons. Twenty-one enemy fighters were shot down, and one Liberator and one Wellington are missing.Rumania.49. A heavy attack by 271 Liberators was made on Bucharest railway centrebut results were obscured by clouds; a smaller raid by 57 Liberators was also madeon Nis railway centre. The same weather conditions resulted in scattered bombingby 138 Fortresses on the town of Ploesti.Turnu- Severin airfield and railway centre and Brasov (85 miles N.N.W. ofBucharest) airfield and railway centre were bombed by 151 and 148 Liberatorsrespectively and the targets were well hit.In &quot;all these operations 1,604 tons of bombs were released, 26 enemy fighters were shot down, and 15 Allied bombers and four fighters are missing.Russia.50. Considerable air support was given by the Russian Air Force to theoperations in the Crimea. On the 11th and 12th operations were mainly directedin support of the advancing troops, with attacks on a small scale againstFeodosia and possibly against other Crimean ports. On the 13th, the major effortappears to have been switched from close support to the bombing of ports and theharassing of German attempts at evacuation. By the 13th, the Russians claimedundisputed air supremacy. On the 16th, the Russians claimed the destruction of28 German aircraft on the ground, resulting from an attack on Capt. Khersonetzairfield (immediately west of Sebastopol).Four attacks were delivered during the week by the Long-Range bomber force, on Constanza, on Sebastopol twice, and on, Galatz. Both attacks onSebastopol and the attack on Galatz are claimed to have caused extensive damage,mainly through fire.On the main South Russian front between the Dniester Estuary and Jassy, a fairly high scale of German activity was maintained. It is considered that theG.A.F. now disposes of some 600 aircraft of all types in this relatively small sector.This is thought to be the largest concentration achieved by the G.A.F. on anysector of the Russian Front since 1943, and is perhaps an indication of theimportance attached by the German High Command to holding the present line.Burma.51.   In the Upper Chindwin, Chin Hills, Assam and Imphal totalof 441 bomber and 403 fighter-bomber sorties were flown. Attacks were madeon enemy positions, camps, transport and dumps.Operations were carried out and effective support provided for our land forces in the areas of Arakan, Myitkyina nad Katha.

Following a low-level raid by Bostons, personnel and stores at Tad]iand on nearby islands were bombed by Liberators and medium bombers, which dropped a total of 253 tons of bombs. About three-quarters of &quot;a camp and supplyarea between But and Dagua was reported to have been demolished after anattack by Liberators, during which 224 tons of bombs were dropped.
Gun positions, stores and dumps near Hollandia in Dutch New Guineawere bombed by about 100 Allied aircraft, which dropped 217 tons and destroyedeight Japanese aircraft in combat. On the following day, more than 200escorted bombers were despatched to the same target; bad weather was encountered and a number are missing but details are not yet available.Liberators dropped 186 tons at Hansa Bay and 36 tons at Uligan Harbour,while medium bombers attacked Karkar Island and other objectives in theMadang area.Composite forces of heavy and medium bombers released 290 tons at Aitapeand carried out attacks in strength against Wewak and Boram. Wagar, nearBogadjim, was machine-gunned by Airacobras in support of Allied troops.New Britain and New Ireland.53. Two attacks on Kavieng airfields were made by Dauntless and Avengers,which also raided a new landing-strip on the shores of Atalikikun Bay. the routine bombing of airfields near Rabaul and of the supply dumps at Tahili Baycontinued on the usual scale.Bougainville.54. Gun emplacements on the south-west coast, targets on the Torokinaperimeter and the Japanese encampment near Empress Augusta Bay were targets for light bombers, which flew 215 sorties between the 11th and 14th.      *Caroline Islands.55. On the 13th, Liberators attacked Truk Atoll, dropping 55 tons of bombs and, on the 16th, bombed Satawan airfield in the Monoi Group (30 tons) with good effect.Kurile Islands.56.

Five large aircraft on the field appearto have been destroyed, and three more damaged.Arniimswalde. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the13th April shows that severe damage was caused to the aircraft engine works ofPomeresche Motorenbau in the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 11th April. At least three machine shops, the possible final assembly shop and the main offices werepartly destroyed and other buildings were damaged.

Of eight buildings to which externalrepairs at least had been completed, four have been destroyed or severely damaged. Eleven other buildings and five barrack huts have been destroyed and seven/ten aircraft are seen to be damaged.Rpstock. An immediate interpretation of photographs, taken on the 15thApril after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 11th April, shows that the main weightof the attack has fallen on the southern part of the town, where heavy damage has been caused to business and residential property: this area had escaped inthe previous general devastation. The Ernst Heinkel Flugzeugwerke G. m.-b. H.(sub-factory) and the adjoining power station have been severely damaged, andmany hits on the goods yard have damaged sheds, tracks and rolling stock. Inaddition the gas works has received further damage. Some craters have been caused on the Rostock-Marienehe airfield.Stettin.

Two large hangars, and five workshops were severely damaged, one medium hangar destroyed and another damaged, and twopersonnel huts destroyed with four more partly destroyed. Photographs taken during the attack indicate tJhat three aircraft on the ground were probably destroyed or damaged.Luneburg Airfield. An immediate interpretation of photographs, taken onthe 18th April after the U.S.A.A.F. attack earlier in the day, shows that the weight of the attack fell on the north side of the airfield where four large hangars,barracks, and administrative and stores buildings have been damaged in varyingdegree. Approximately 75 craters have been made on and around the tarmacapron in this area, and three aircraft on the ground have been damaged.Berlin. A responsible source reports that production in the resultof air attack has been reduced by at least 40 per cent, from what it was a yearago. This has been caused not only by the destruction of a number of works whoserestoration is impossible, but also by the fact that workers have left the areanotwithstanding inducements for them to remain, and many skilled workers havedeserted their posts. Better flak protection is openly demanded. If suchimproved defence to their factories is not forthcoming, the workers &apos;&apos; go slow &apos;&apos;and let it be known that their slogan is &quot; better flak defence, better work.&quot; Thesituation in West and North-West Germany is believed to be the same. In fact,the only areas in which industrial production approaches normal are Bohemia,Moravia, Silesia, Poland and East Prussia.   -France.Paris I Juvisy-sur-Orge.-Photographs show that the attack on the18/19th April caused a heavy concentration of craters on the tracks of the marshalling yard.
