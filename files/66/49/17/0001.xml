THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT     ^   Q :Printed for the War Cabinet.  April 1944.SECRET. - Copy No. 6 0W.P. (44) 217.21s  ^pniZ, 1944.WAR CABINET.COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.1. The aim is to create the most favourable conditions for the restorationand expansion (by at least 50 per cent, over pre-war) of our export trade. Themethod is to negotiate with the Dominions and with foreign countries.2.   The main requirements of our post-war Commercial Policy are : (a) A widespread clearance of the pre-war obstacles to world trade. Thisis of special importance for this country, which must import manyessential foodstuffs and raw materials. These can only be paid forby a very large expansion of our exports of manufactured goods.(6) A &quot;multilateral1&apos; commercial convention. A series of &quot;bilateral&quot;agreements, particularly if confined within the bounds of the UnitedStates Trade Agreements Act, would be too slow and too restricted.A reduction in the United States tariff alone is too limited an objective. We need a world wide cut in high tariffs and in othertrade barriers, especially in import quotas.(c) No more Most-Favoured-Nation arrangements of the old type. We should give no commercial advantages to other countries, without a simultaneous quid pro quo.(d) We must retain the right to protect ourselves from external shocks (suchas an economic collapse in the United States) by limiting our importswhen, for any reason, our international payments would otherwise be seriously out of balance.3. The present proposals for Commercial Policy are outlined in Section ii of this paper. They link up closely with the proposals for Monetary Policy.They were discussed, at great length, by an official committee under theChairmanship of Sir Arnold Overton in 1942-43; with Dominion officials inLondon in June 1943; with United States officials in Washington in September1943; and again with Dominion officials in London last month. At each stage inthis long journey the War Cabinet has authorised the next step. In particular,in April 1943, the War Cabinet provisionally approved our taking the initiative in Washington in putting forward proposals on the lines recommended by theofficial committee, subject to a preliminary exchange of views with theDominions. And in July 1943 the War Cabinet&apos; approved a paper, on the same lines, to be used by our representative in Washington and to be handed toMr. Cordell Hull. &apos; -- II. -4. Tariffs and Preferences.-The proposals contain provisional suggestions for the simultaneous reduction of tariffs and preferences. But Article VIIprovides that the economic arrangements to be made must be &quot;mutuallyadvantageous,&quot; and there can be no question of preferences being reduced, exceptin return for a widespread reduction of all forms of trade barriers, including notonly the American but other high tariffs, and including not only tariffs but otherimport restrictions. If we fail to get a satisfactory agreement, we shall be free if we and the Dominons wish to maintain, or indeed extend, the presentpreferences.5. We should press for a uniform tariff ceiling. Failing this there shouldbe, as a first step, a graduated cut, which reduces high tariffs substantially, andmoderate tariffs only moderately, and leaves low tariffs untouched.[27322]
6. In return for a sufficient concession on tariffs, and on quantitative restrictions (see 9 below), preferential margins might be reduced either(a) by a uniform percentage cut, or (b) by lowering non-preferential rates of duty, but leaving preferential rates unchanged. In the latter case nopreferential rate of duty would be raised, except where it was desired to raise&apos;a revenue duty. In either case we should urge that no preferential margin need be reduced below, say, 5 per cent, ad valorem. [As regards (b) above, it would no doubt be preferable, from the United Kingdom point of view, to lowerpreferential rates of duty in equal proportion to non-preferential rates, but Ihave reason to believe that this would be strongly opposed, not by the Americansonly, but also by certain of the Dominions.]7. For infant industries a temporary measure of special tariff protectionshould be permitted, under proper safeguards as to its amount and duration, andthe type of industry for which it should be allowed.8. Subsidies.-*We should retain freedom to protect home production by subsidies to any extent we may find necessary. Levy-subsidies (as under the pre-war Wheat Act) would be allowed, provided the levy did not exceed the rate of duty permitted under the tariff rules. Export subsidies would be banned, wxcept perhaps in certain exceptional and clearly defined cases.9. Quantitative Restrictions on Imports, subject to certain clearly definedexceptions, would be forbidden. But, on the basis of an objective criterionrelating to our monetary reserves, we, or any other country, would be free to restrict imports to any extent necessary to defend our balance of payments.10. State-trading. State-trading, including long-term contracts and bulkpurchases, would be fully permitted, subject to safeguards against discriminationor excess protection.11.   Membership of the proposed Commercial Policy Organisation. TheConvention would take effect, when States accounting for a prescribed percentageof world trade had adhered, sufficient to ensure that no effective rival bloc couldbe formed.  The benefits of the reductions of trade barriers would not be extended&apos; to non-members, except in return for equivalent concessions by them.12. Transitional Period. The reductions of tariffs and preferences and theother obligations of the proposed Commercial Convention would not come intoforce until a specified date, and countries would be free to adopt an import pro-gramme, involving the use of quantitative restrictions, for a further period to be defined. Thereafter, the quantitative regulation of imports would be subject tothe conditions at 9 above.III.13. These proposals, if adopted, would clear the way for the necessaryexpansion of our exports. They would permit us to regulate imports during the transition, and thereafter whenever our balance of payments required.14. They would also enable us to maintain a healthy and well-balancedagriculture. Those methods for protecting agriculture (such as tariffs and import restrictions) which raise prices to consumers would be subject to internationallimitation. Subsidies, which do not raise prices to consumers, would not. other methods (such as the levy-subsidy arrangements under the Wheat Act or importsthrough State-trading) would also be permitted, provided they were not used toraise prices to the consumer by more than a specified amount.IV.15. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that, when we discuss thissubject with the Dominion Prime Ministers, we inform them that we regard theseproposals, in paragraphs 4 to 12 above, as being in the best interests of thiscountry and of the British Commonwealth and Empire, and as a good basis forfurther discussion with the United States at the official level.Such discussion would aim at agreement on a Declaration of Principles on commercial Policy, similar to that already reached on Monetary Policy.H. D.Board of Trade, Millbank, S. W. 1,21st April, 1944.
