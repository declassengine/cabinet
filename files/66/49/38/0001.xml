THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTHE EGYPTIAN CRISIS, 194412th April, 1944. (1)From Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 721.)King Farouk summoned me this afternoon.2. He read and handed me memorandum, of which text is given in my immediately following telegram.*3. His Majesty followed this up with the following verbal declaration,which I took down at his dictation : For the first time with this new Government, at the head of which is going to be a man known to be a friend of yours and of the British, I feelthat it is more [sic ? now] possible to put an end to all misunderstandingsbetween us and start with a new page and put once and for all our relations on the basis of mutual understanding.&apos;&apos;His Majesty added that he and I had crossed swords in the past; hence theabove declaration.4. Elaborating the above (our conversation was throughout on a mostamiable basis, on which I purposely kept it), His Majesty said it came to this :- There could not be two Kings of Egypt (I hurriedly interpolated, to hisconsiderable amusement, that we had already found one was quite enough!).5.   I made it clear forthwith that I was not prepared to make more thanpurely preliminary comment.6.   My first : That it was a pity His Majesty had faced us with this bomb-shell withoutpreliminary warning through Hasanein or otherwise. That it might in the eventhave proved to make His Majesty&apos;s position easier had he known our view inadvance.7.   My second :  That whilst no Egyptian Government or Prime Minister was perfect, thepresent Administration had admirably fulfilled their role of loyal war-time allyand to our complete satisfaction; and when others were waivering they hadrobustly [ 1 group omitted] confidence in us and held firm during the testingmonths of 1942 when the enemy was at the gates. From our (external) point ofview it was clear beyond dispute that Nahas Pasha and his Government had notonly been above reproach, but done all in their power to sustain and help thewar effort.8. Along the same train of thought I could imagine no more inopportunemoment than the present, when the fate of Egypt and&quot; the whole world hung inthe balance, in cold blood to provoke a change in the Government here. Thatsimply did not make sense and I imagine London would feel the same way.9. Furthermore, was His Majesty so sure of his facts and of the truth of the allegations about Nahas Pasha&apos;s recent tour of Upper Egypt % I had been assured that the report(s) of his having insisted upon or being accorded Royal honoursby the army or receiving salutes were quite unfounded.10. His Majesty insisted that he had ample grounds for his complaints thathis Prime Minister was deliberately infringing upon his Royal position.11. I made His Majesty admit that the paper he had handed me could inno sense be regarded as a decision : and that nothing would be done upon it untilI had had time to consult His Majesty&apos;s Government, but that he begged for speed.12. I said that I would naturally submit a full report of our talk, but thatit was fair to warn him the answer might be once more &quot; a lemon &quot; of apronounced kind (referring to our earlier letter about Yemen). It was, therefore,all the more important that His Majesty should rigorously prevent any leakage* No. (2).[27348] b
of what he had proposed to me to-day until I was able to see him again and continue our &quot; friendly and informal &quot; exchange of view. His Majesty [ ? groupomitted] he entirely agreed.13. At one point he referred to my exchange of letters with Nahas Pashaof 5th February, 1942, and seemed to argue [ ? group omitted : ? that] that wouldeliminate all possibility of my anticipated lemon. I pointed out that; if he read the text more attentively, he would see that it had been carefully drawn up, andthat, whilst our policy might be [ ? group omitted], and certainly was not tointerfere internally, circumstances were quite conceivable where we might bothbe justified and have to do so in support of that very policy.14. Finally, i drew from him list of members of his proposed interim government. He was evidently somewhat reluctant to disclose these names, andI was not surprised when he gave them, to wit: Hasanein Pasha (PrimeMinister), with a Cabinet largely composed of ex-officials and officials (HassanSadek, Saba Habashy, Has...... Rifaat, Shousa, Under-Secretary of Health)and nonentities (Amr Pasha, the Racquets champion, &amp;c), a collection obviouslycutting no ice whatever in the country. I at once pointed out to His Majestythat the idea of such a regime at a time like this was surely not serious?   Wehad had enough of minority Governments (Hassen Sadek and Hussein Sir......),and there must be in office someone carrying the country with him.   Why notlet Nahas Pasha go to the country and test the [ \ group undecypherable :? people&apos;s] vote ?   This idea naturally did not at all smile [sic] upon Hi*sMajesty.15. As I felt it undesirable to pursue the discussion, I repeated that myremarks must be regarded as strictly personal and preliminary. I must alsoemphasise that i thought this more [sic % most] inopportune and likely to draw a sharp response from us. But as to that i must defer further comment untilI had my instructions.16. I repeat that our talk was throughout markedly friendly. But it isclear that His Majesty does not in the slightest degree appreciate that the waris still in the balance or that we need worry ourselves any further with thepolitical stability of our base here in Egypt.17.   My considered comment will follow as soon as possible.(2)From Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 722.)Following is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram : *&quot; Your Excellency will recall that in May of last year I expressed the concern I then felt about the present Ministry on account of the grave accusations-tions publicly brought against its integrity. The Ministry&apos;s attempt^ todefend itself in Parliament left public opinion unmoved and did nothingwhatever towards dispelling doubts and suspicions with which its conductof affairs was regarded throughout the country.&quot; I drew your Excellency&apos;s attention to Toss of prestige and moralauthority which the Ministry had suffered because of the reflection on itsintegrity and indicated that a change of Government was desirable. in deference, however, to the British Governmenfs wish that the ministry should continue in office because of services it was rendering to the Alliedwar effort, &quot;and in order to demonstrate how much I had the successful prosecution of the war at heart, I undertook to keep the Ministry for thetime being and to maintain official relations with it.&quot; This engagement on my part has been fulfilled in letter and in spirit.It has been my constant endeavour, as a loyal Ally to Great Britain, to do everything in my power to encourage the Ministry to give all possible help to hasten victory of Allied Arms.&quot; After agitation roused by charges of corruption, it was hoped thatthe Government would have the wisdom and prudence to put its house inorder, and to govern the country with such propriety that the publicconscience would no longer be troubled with doubts regarding all our administration. Unfortunately, the desired reforms have not taken place.On the contrary, the corruption of the Administration is more flagrant than ever and has become a grave public scandal without precedent in the history
of Egypt. This is a known arid admitted fact by high and low throughoutthe length and breadth of the country.&quot; But corruption is not the only charge now levelled against the present government. Of late the Ministry has embarked on a course of action aimeddirectly and openly at bringing the throne into public contempt. YourExcellency has no doubt followed with concern the recent moves andutterances of the Prime Minister. You will have noted his behaviour inforestalling my visit to Minieh and Assiut after this had been announced in the Press. Your Excellency may also have observed the Royal ceremonialwith which Nahas Pasha has arranged that he should be everywhere received,and you are no doubt aware of the forced collection of money from inhabitants of several provinces to be devoted to the creation of charitable institutionsbearing the name of Nahas Pasha. I would also draw your Excellency&apos;sparticular attention to Nahas Pasha&apos;s speeches regarding the recent malariaepidemic and privation bordering on famine in Upper Egypt, speechescontain denials of gravity of the situation and by implication has threatenedthe veracity of the King who it is well known took his Prime Minister and ministers to task on this subject some time ago. That the situation was indeed grave is not open to argument, nor need I dwell on this matter having in mind your Excellency&apos;s own communique regarding distribution ofsupplies in stricken areas. I could give many recent examples of otherimproper and disquieting actions of the Government; public moneys havebeen used for propaganda purposes in favour of the Wafdist party.Attempts are being made to subvert elementary schools&apos; teachers, AzharUniversity, police and army and to transform them into political instrumentsin the interests of the Wafd.&quot; Your Excellency will, I am sure, agree that meetings and actions ofthe Prime Minister, of which I have given some instances, cannot fail to havea disturbing and disintegrating effect on the Administration, and may, ifa termination is not put to them, affect the peace and tranquillity of [group undecypherable :   ? Egypt].&quot; In the light of the above facts of widespread and notorious corruption,mal-administration of the country, subversion of certain elements of thecommunity [ ? group omitted : ? and] open and flagrant, disrespect towardsthe throne, I have decided after careful reflection that my duty towards my country and its people compel me to make a change of Government.&quot; Your Excellency will perhaps be interested to know of my intentions as regards successors of the present Government. Before doing so, I would,however, like to say that a loyal and generous fulfilment of the terms of theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance is a matter on which His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Government may confidently rely.&quot; It will be my constant and personal concern to ensure that my Govern-ment will at all times strive its utmost to help its Ally to bring the war toa victorious conclusion.&quot; As an immediate successor to the present Government, my intention is to appoint a Ministry composed of men of integrity with &quot;no markedparty affiliations, known to be well disposed to Great Britain and who can therefore be relied upon to collaborate wholeheartedly with the Alliedauthorities worthy of the war effort.&quot; This Ministry will with all due speed and in ia matter of a few monthshold, free elections. It will thereafter resign and a Government will beappointed in accordance with the will of the people of Egypt as freelydeclared in polling booths throughout the country.&quot;From, Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 731.)MY telegrams Nos. 721* and 722.tI approached this question from the angle of war interest. What are thefacts? Leaving aside the question of their internal shortcomings, present government have given and continue to give all that we want from that angle.They stood by us in the bad days before Alamein. There could be no worse timefor a change or the turmoil of an election.   Wafd are far from perfect but they13th April.(3)
continue to deliver the goods and I believe (though I cannot prove it) that they still have a majority. They could and no doubt would be most tiresome in opposition. In short, if the stability of Egypt as a base remains imperative andour policy holds good that we must have a loyal Government backed by amajority in the country, it stands to reason it is better to keep them in.2.   Following seems the choice of courses of action :  (a) To let King Farouk go ahead without opposition. This I rule out for reasons given in paragraph 1 above, out of loyalty to Nahas Pashaand particularly because our experience of minority Governments isnot encouraging.(6) Tell him we strongly disapprove, and that, whilst not prepared to preventhim, his blood will be on his own head. This I like no better. Itwould weaken us and only lead to confusion.(c) Short of force use every argument and effort to deter him urging theinexpediency of forcing what threatens to be a crisis until the war situation is clearer. If he still insists on a change of Government,press him to allow Nahas Pasha to go to the country. If he refusedthat, then hold him responsible for full implementation of the treaty and for the internal security of our war bases. I do not like thiseither though preferable to (a) or (b) but it would mean [group undecypherable: ? complete] disregard of our &quot;advice&quot;&apos; a most undesirable precedent. It would weaken our position. But we would at least have made it clear to the public that we had stood up for thosewho had stood by us.(d) Be prepared if necessary to use force to prevent dismissal of the present government, at least until the war situation is clearer and the momentmore opportune.3. This is the course I personally should prefer, provided that we areprepared at this juncture, and with a somewhat discredited Government, to takerisks involved. For I am bound to point out that the situation is by no means soclear cut as it was in 1942. The enemy being no longer at the gates, King Faroukhas less opportunity for mischief. His Majesty is more popular than he was in1942 and use of force against him would rouse more resentment now, especiallyin the army. Moreover, he is now offering us every assurance of loyalty including an interim Government specially chosen from well-known pro-British elements.There is also the difficulty of Nahas Pasha&apos;s own position created by the termsof his letter to me of the 5th February, 1942.4. I find it difficult to be more specific in my recommendations withoutknowing the degree of importance now attached to this area by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the general scheme of things. I should hope that the actual use of force against King Farouk would not be necessary to bring him to heel.15th April. (4)From Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 749.)Substance of your telegram No. 510* communicated to Hassanein forKing Farouk&apos;s information this evening with a strong message to the effect thatI counted on His Majesty&apos;s doing nothing pending receipt of instructions.Failing such an assurance, I would have to ask for an audience to-morrow withHis Majesty, which I particularly wished to avoid in view of the flutter it would inevitably cause among the public at such a juncture.Hassanein entirely agreed that an audience would be inexpedient at this moment and gave an assurance that no action would be taken before receipt of instructions unless disorders occurred, in which case the Palace would communi-cate with me before doing anything. He expressed the earnest hope that HisMajesty would not be kept waiting much longer for answer. I venture again toemphasise the need for speed in view of the possibility that one side or the othermay get out of hand.I am putting a discreet word of warning through Amin to avoid anything which might furnish any pretext.* Not reproduced.
(6)From Prime Minister to Lord Killearn.(No. 520.)My immediately preceding telegram.*I am not sure how far Nahas Pasha is aware of the King&apos;s intentions norhow much he knows of what passed between the King and you, and I must leave it to you therefore to decide exactly the form in which you put to Nahas therequest referred to in my message to the King.* No. (5).17th April.

Meantime, my telegram No. 7491must, I think, have crossed your telegram No. 519.* In it, I reported that I hadon Saturday evening obtained a pledge of sorts from the Palace to take no actionpending my instructions from home, and that the Government had beensimilarly warned to do nothing provocative.2. In the circumstances, I should prefer not to see King Farouk until Ireceive His Majesty&apos;s Governments final instructions, meantime holding thePrime Minister&apos;s message to His Majesty in reserve for use in case of need,Please inform me urgently if you agree. Incidentally I am a little nervous of sentence 4 thereof which if delivered at this stage might tempt either side to provoke the other into violent action.* No. (5).t No. (6).% No. (4).From Prime Minister to Lord Killearn. T. 844a/4.(No. 519.)Your telegram No. 731.*You may, if you see fit, give the following message to King Faroukfrom me: &quot; The issue which has unhappily arisen between Your Majesty and theNahas Government is so important that I must have an opportunity of bringing it before the &quot;War Cabinet. I have convened them for this purpose for an early date next week.&quot; I trust therefore you will not take any violent action in the interval.&quot; I am instructing His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to take all measuresavailable to him to ensure that Nahas Pasha equally refrains from suchaction.&quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government would almost certainly range themselves against whoever strikes first.&quot; Considering that Egypt has through our exertions been spared thehorrors of invasion and of becoming a battlefield, and remains an unravaged,peaceful and prosperous land, we have a right to address you on thissubject.&quot;Please see my immediately following telegram, t* No. (3). f No. (6).
From Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 759.)My telegram No. 754.*Hassanein has just (1.30 p.m.) rung up the Oriental Secretary to say that king Farouk has signed rescript revoking the present Ministry.2. This is clear breach of faith of the Palace pledge to take no actionpending seeing me again.3. I am seeing His Majesty this afternoon when I shall deliver the PrimeMinister&apos;s message in your telegram No. 519t and emphasise the gravity ofprecipitate action by His Majesty which he must hold up or take full consequences.* No. (7). f No- (5)-(9)From Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 760.)My telegram No. 759*I saw King Farouk at 1.45 p.m; to-day and gave him the Prime Ministersmessage, leaving him a copy in full.2. I remonstrated with His Majesty for having broken his definite pledge to me through Hasanein on Saturday evening that he would take no actionbefore seeing me again and learning the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government.His Majesty admitted his pledge, but argued that circumstances had forced his hand. The news had got out (he did not blame us for that) and it had becomeimperative to act immediately as Nahas Pasha was due to-day in Alexandriawhere there would be a repetition of his Upper Egypt performance.3. I observed that this seemed on the face of it to be jumping to conclusionsahead of events. Anyway I must [group undecypherable : ? warn] him formallyof the unwisdom of hasty action before knowing the views of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment which might reach me at any minute now. And I drew his special attention to paragraph 6 of the Prime Ministers message.4. His Majesty said that he would ponder this message and would send mean answer within the next hour.5. I warned His Majesty that, as stated in the Prime Ministers message,I should forthwith be getting in contact with Nahas Pasha and warning himonce more against any provocative actions.6. On my way out, I saw Hasanein Pasha and repeated the same languageto him.* No. (8).(10)From Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 762.)My telegram No. 761.*Hassanein has just telephoned King Farouk&apos;s reply to the Prime Ministersmessage as follows: &quot;His Majesty will wait for His Majesty&apos;s governments views before taking a decision.&quot;2.   At my request Hassanein repeated the word &quot; decision.&quot;3. I informed Hassanein I had [group omitted : ? warned] the government against any provocative action. I understand that Nahas Pasha&apos;s programme has not been to go to Alexandria until to-morrow (Wednesday). In reply toHassanein&apos;s enquiry I did not know Nahas Pasha&apos;s present intentions.* Not reproduced.
(12)From Prime Minister to Lord Killearn. T. 874/4.Your No. 762*Cabinet will meet to-morrow (Wednesday) evening. It will very likelysupport a democratic administration against a Palace clique headed by anOriental despot who on every occasion has proved himself a poor friend toEngland. Meanwhile however make sure that the Commanders-in-Chief have attheir disposal sufficient forces to deal with any trouble in Egypt as well as cope with the Greeks.* No. (10).(13)From Chiefs of Staff  to Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East,  repeatedA.F.H.Q., Algiers.(C.O.S. (ME) 467.)1. Recent telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to Foreign Officeindicate possibility of political crisis closely resembling that of Black Book periodof May 1943.  Your CC/228* dated 5th May, 1943, refers.2. We shall be glad to receive your appreciation of the military implications-tions of the present situation.3. Your should indicate whether, in your estimation the forces now at yourdisposal are sufficient to meet any emergency which may arise in Egypt inaddition to your other commitments.* Not reproduced.(14)From General Paget to C.I.G.S.(CS. 2670.)Reference Telegram 721* from Ambassador, Cairo, to Foreign Office, dated12th April.In paragraph 3 Ambassador favours use (?) of force if necessary to military dismissal of present Government. I am strongly opposed to any actionwhich may lead to use of force by us against the Egyptians from point of viewof security of Middle East base. Effect of use of force on this security would inmy opinion be much more serious than consequence of dismissal of present government. In particular Egyptian Army stands by King and if antagonisedby use of force would create serious security problem for us. I have so informedAmbassador.* No. (1).(15)From Lord Moyne to Foreign Office.(No. 994.)Ambassadors telegram No. 731.*A special meeting of Defence Committee was held to-day to considerthe consequences resulting from situation as exposed in above-mentioned and.preceding telegrams.(11)From Foreign Office to Lord Killearn.(No. 524.)Your telegram No. 754.*I agree.You may at your discretion omit fourth sentence of suggested message.* No. (7).
Service members of the Defence Committee were strongly opposed to the useof force in any way to impose a course of action on the King as they consider theprobable results would constitute a greater threat to the security of our base inEgypt and to the general war effort in the Middle East than any disturbanceswhich might arise from the Wafd being out of office. They considered we shouldalmost certainly have active opposition from the Egyptian Army if the King werecoerced, and at the very best we would lose the services of 20,000 men nowco-operating in securing our base. Commander-in-Chief is telegraphing his views to the War Office separately.The effect also on other Middle East countries might well be serious. Thespontaneous and unanimous reaction of all Arab countries to French action inBeirut last November shows the increased extent to which the Arab world is nowsusceptible to events in any one member of it. Admittedly, the reaction in other states to strong measures in Egypt on our part is unlikely to be so violent as thatdisplayed on the occasion of the Lebanon crisis, but it would be unwise to count too much on this. We are, however, in Egypt on considerably weaker ground legallythan were the French since her independence has been fully recognised by us since1936. Furthermore, Nahas Pasha when taking office on 5th February, 1942,insisted on an exchange of letters, of which the following are relevant sentences.He stated in his letter : &quot;I accept this mission on the basis that neither theAnglo-Egyptian Treaty nor Egypt&apos;s situation as a sovereign and independentcountry permit her Allies to intervene in her internal affairs and particularly inthe constitution and resignation of Cabinets.&quot; The Ambassadors reply contained the following words : &quot;I assure your Excellency that the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is to secure sincere collaboration of the Government of Egypt as anindependent Allied&apos;country in the execution of Anglo-Egyptian Treaty without interference in internal affairs of Egypt or in the constitution or changes of herGovernment.&quot; It would be hard to make out now a case of overriding military necessity as we could in 1942. We should also lay ourselves open to strong criticism on the part of the French. What the King wishes to do is, I am informed, within his constitutional rights, whereas the action of the LebaneseGovernment, if mandate is held to be legally operative, could have been regardedas ultra vires.Finally, possible Egyptian reactions should not be lost sight of.In view of the opinion of Service Chiefs and of other considerations advancedabove, it seems to me that the use of force is not practicable.An additional alternative to those in telegram No. 731* was discussed,namely, to explain to Nahas that considerations no longer exist which would justify our acting in contradiction to our undertaking given him in the ambassador&apos;s above-quoted letter. We can therefore only support a retention of office by persuasion. If, however, he wishes us to press his claims it was thoughtthat we should not do so to the extent of threatening the King and should, if need be, accept dismissal of the Government on basis of last paragraph of the King&apos;saide-memoire.The Ambassador said he would consider it an unwarranted risk to attemptbluffing the King by suggesting coercion unless we were prepared to fulfil ourthreat.* No. (3).(16)From Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 767.)Memin telegram No. 994.*I do not propose to comment as my views are already fully before you. Myonly modification would be to insist upon course C of my telegram No. 7311 i.e.,either retention of Nahas Pasha or allow Nahas Pasha himself to go to the polls.2. I did, however, tell the meeting that I should most warmly welcome a really free election were such possible. But that, in my opinion, this idea was notpractical politics least of all under a government headed by Hassanein, well-known as out and out henchman of the Palace, who would see to it that nahas pasha who by his dismissal would stand automatically condemned in the eyes of the electorate did not get any support at the polls.* No. (15).f No. (3).
From Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, to Chiefs of Staff.(CCL/393.)Reference your COS (ME) 467*1.   Present political crisis in Egypt may result in following circumstances : Case A. If present Government goes out of office the WAFD Organisa-tion would become hostile to us. Outbreaks of strikes and riots would occurwhich would necessitate our taking over certain VPs. and essential services.Egyptian army and air force would almost certainly remain on the side ofLaw and Order and continue active co-operation with us, and the chances are that the police would do likewise.Case B. If the WAFD Government is maintained in power by means ofBritish ultimatum and the King abdicates or is deposed, provision must bemade to deal with possible disorders and non-co-operation in Cairo or else-where. Trouble must be expected in the Egyptian Army, and in the worstcircumstances it might become necessary to disarm them.2. For Case A our requirements would be 11 Infantry Battalions or similarunits for protection of VPs. including railways and to provide a mobile reserve.3. For Case B provided Egyptian Army and Air Force were merely non-co-operative, and not actually hostile to us, we would require a total of 22 infantry battalions or equivalent 3 Armoured Regiments and 5700 AA and CD Troops forroles, and in Case A plus taking over minewatching and AA and CD duties nowperformed by Egyptian Army. If Egyptian Army and Air Force became activelyhostile, a further 14 and 4 Fd. Regiments would be required, giving total of 36Infantry Battalions, 3 Armoured Regiments, 4 Fd. Regiments and 5,700 AA and.CD Troops. Additional static Guards would be required on ports, oil installa-tions, depots and other VPs., but we anticipate being able to provide these fromtroops already stationed in the areas.4. Upwards of a 150,000 local personnel are employed in the various serviceinstallations throughout Egypt and some disturbance of this labour is likely in both Cases A and B. This would affect the efficiency of the M.E. Base andthe working of the ports. Furthermore reliance is more than ever to-day being-placed on the R.A.F. M.E. Maintenance Units manned mainly by civilians toproduce aircraft to meet wastage in R.A.F. Squadrons of M.AA.F.5. After allowing for the transfer of formations already detailed for overseas and the commitment in connection with the present Greek situation wehave the following armed forces in the M.E. :46 Inf. Div.56 Inf. Div. less one Bde.31 Ind. Armd. Div. less one Armd. Regt.3 Ind. Inf. Bns.3 Med. Regts.2 An-Tk. Regts.Belgian Bde. Gp. of the above 46 Inf. Div. is in Palestine on IS. duties and31 Ind. Armd. Div. is in Syria. 56 Inf. Div. less one Inf. Bde. considerablyunder strength could be made available. Also AA troops required if disband-ment of Regts. now in progress were postponed although number of searchlightsnow manned by Egyptians might present difficulties. Belgian Bde. could onlybe used for Guard duties.6. In Case B, R.A.F. would expect main trouble from Egyptian Air Forceand two Egyptian Balloon Squadrons. Balloon Squadron personnel could not bereplaced at short notice and gaps might be left in Canal zone cover. Egyptian AirForce could be countered with present resources.7. To sum up we could find the forces necessary for Case A but for Case Bwe should require reinforcements from without the ME. Command to the extentof 18 Inf. Batts., 3 Armd. Regts., and 1 Fd. Regt.No. (13).
(18)From General Wilson to General Paget, repeated Chiefs of Staff.(F. 34427.)With reference to possible political developments in Egypt as given inC.O.S. (M.E.) 467* of 18th April, I feel that it would be most detrimental tothe war effort if this were permitted to cause any interruption of or interferencewith the flow of reinforcements and units now scheduled for movement fromMideast to Central Mediterranean. Any further allocation of troops for internal security would have equally bad effect.May I have report of situation and your intentions?* No. (13).20th April. (19)From Prime Minister to General Wilson. T. 891/4.(OZ. 2065.)With reference to your telegram F. 34427* of 19th April to General Paget,you might look up our correspondence on a similar occasion over the Black Bookcrisis this time last year. I have advised this course to General Paget and others.In this case I am playing for time a little, in order to get the Greek mutiniesout of the wav.* No. (18).(20)From Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 788.)Your telegram No. 519.*Hasanein asked the Oriental Counsellor to call on him and handed him at p.m. the following message from King Farouk for me to communicate to thePrime Minister : &quot; In telegram from the British Prime Minister which your Excellencyhanded to me on 18th April, I was asked to refrain from taking any actionagainst Nahas Government and was told that His Britannic Majesty&apos;sGovernment &apos; would almost certainly range themselves against whoeverstrikes first.&apos;&quot; It has now come to my knowledge that Nahas Pasha intends atto-night&apos;s sitting of the Chamber of Deputies, very likely to be transformedinto a secret session, to question the King&apos;s constitutional rights which havebeen applied and enforced since the promulgation of the Constitution andto argue that the King will be acting unconstitutionally in the event of histaking any action within the limits of his rights.&quot; All reports reaching me agree that whatever the nature and [sic ? of]. discussions this evening may be Nahas Pasha&apos;s intention is to deliver anattack on the King.&quot; I would therefore request your Excellency to telegraph the situation as set out above immediately to Mr. Churchill and to say that in this caseNahas Pasha &apos; is striking first &apos; and that action must at once be taken toprevent any parliamentary debate or decisions which would infringe theKing&apos;s prerogatives or be detrimental to his dignity or prestige.&quot;2. The Oriental Counsellor told Hasanein that we had already receivedsimilar reports and that Amin Osman, on being asked about them, hadcategorically denied any such proceedings taking place in the Chamber this afternoon. The Deputies, Amin Osman said, had been summoned for this after-noon^ unusual session (as a rule they do not meet on Thursdays) in case thepolitical situation became critical to-day. But as things were, only ordinary business would be transacted.
3. Hasanein reminded the Oriental Counsellor of the occasion when AminOsman had conveyed us an assurance from the Prime Minister that Hilali wouldnot continue discussion of Hasanein&apos;s private debts and nevertheless Hilali had continued. He begged that the Ambassador should again get a categoricalassurance from Amin Osman that no direct or indirect attacks would be madeon the King in the Chamber this evening.4. I have since spoken once more to the Secretary-General emphasising the urgency of avoiding anything provocative or which might be interpreted by the palace as giving pretext for action. He has assured me categorically that onlynormal business will be transacted in this afternoon&apos;s session; that Nahas Pashawill not himself attend; and begged me to add that, unlike the Palace, theGovernment stuck to their word.(21)From Prime Minister to Lord Killearn, Lord Moyne and the T. 892/4.Three Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East.(No. 560.)The War Cabinet had under consideration to-day various telegrams fromthe Middle East about the dispute between King Farouk and his Government.They also re-read the telegrams which had passed on a very similar occasionalmost exactly a year ago. They recommend that all parties should re-readthese telegrams. They show most clearly the quite needless fears entertainedby the then Commanders-in-Chief, and the gloomy prophecies which were madeby the military authorities. They also show the anxieties expressed by the thenMinister of State, the decisions which were taken here to override these points of view, and the happy results attained by firm action by His Majesty&apos;ambassador, not excluding the possible use of force.2. A new complication has arisen on this occasion in the Greek trouble,which involves some of our troops, and which I should like to get settled beforeundertaking further labours. On the other hand, the improvement in theAllied war position is very great since this time last year. While therefore theuse of force to bring pressure upon the King cannot be excluded, it is notprobable that it will be required. It is however desirable to gain a little timeto wear down the Greek mutineers.3. The following message should be delivered, at his discretion, by LordKillearn to King Farouk : &quot;The War Cabinet have heard with much concern that Your Majestycontemplates dismissing from office the government of Nahas Pasha,although this Government has a large majority in the Chamber which has still three years of its lawful term to run. From a parliamentary and constitutional point of view this would appear to be a very doubtful andpossibly dangerous course to embark on. If however Your Majesty feels that an immediate General Election would clear the air and if the PrimeMinister is persuaded to submit himself to the electors, a dissolution forth-with would not be a subject on which His Majesty&apos;s Government would feel it right to express an opinion. The one course which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment feel it would be especially necessary to avoid would be the installation in office of a Palace Minister or other Minister not possessinga majority in the Legislature, and the keeping of this new Minister in power for the purpose of managing the election. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would find it impossible to defend such procedure in public, and would feel bound to instruct their Ambassador to tender formal advice against such a course. The War Cabinet desire me to say that they would appreciatean expression of Your Majesty&apos;s views upon &quot;this matter, which might become exceedingly grave, before any further steps are taken to bring itto a head.&quot;4. Meanwhile the Commanders-in-Chief should take all necessary stepsto make sure that their forces are marshalled and ready to give support to the ambassador should he require it. If you think &apos;&apos; managing the election &apos;&apos; too strong, you are at liberty to substitute &quot; preparing for the election.&quot;
(23)From General Paget to General Wilson, repeated Chiefs of Staff.(CS/2671.)For General Wilson&apos;s eyes only from General Paget: Reference your F. 34427* of 19th April.Agree with your views and for this reason have informed C.I.G.S. I amstrongly opposed to any policy which might involve us in use of force againstEgyptians. See also telegram CCL/393t of 20th April in reply to CCS.

T. 899/4.(No. 800.)Your telegram No. 560.*If I may say so, your telegram No. 5611 fills the bill admirably and I shall be acting under it during the course of to-day. My first step will be to ascertain from Nahas that he is ready if necessary to go to the polls. I think he will; but Isuspect, rather than see him return with a crushing majority, the young monarchwill prefer to leave him where he is.2. If however His Majesty is recalcitrant (I rashly predict it is ninechances out of ten that in the last resort he will not be) then I feel we shouldconcert as publicly as we can with the Egyptian Government what our programme and time-table should be. I shall try and keep them in the forefront as much aspossible : but knowing as you do so well, you will appreciate how unwilling anyEgyptian is to shoulder responsibility or come into the open.3. You have once more dealt me a broad hand for which I am most grateful :I shall use my utmost endeavour to do it justice and deliver the goods. I should prefer now to see how the tricks fall before making more detailed recommenda-tions. We have always a good joker in reserve in Prince Mohammed Ali whofortunately happens to be heir-apparent and has always been 100 per cent, pro-us.4.

But with referenceto Commander-in-Chief&apos;s telegram of 20th April I feel that I should record thatat the meeting with Commander-in-Chief I brought out important point that achange of incumbent of throne was a very different thing to its abolition which Ihad never had in my mind (the throne being an important asset to us if properlyrun).From Prime Minister to Lord Killearn. T. 893/4.(No. 561.)You will have seen my No. 560* of the present date. Let me know exactly what you would like to do, and what you think can be done. It is curious how, sofar, exactly what happened last year has been repeated. However the Palace mayhave learned mischief by experience. General Stone exercised a defeatistinfluence last year.   Is he playing any undue part now?* No. (21).
(26)From Lord. Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 809.)Your telegram No. 560.*I was received by King Farouk at 5 p.m. this afternoon. I gave him the message from the War Cabinet.2. His Majesty at once observed that for reasons already stated in writing(my telegram No. 7221) it was quite impossible to hold an election under nahas pasha. There was in fact nothing new to tell me since his written note. Hehad only contemplated, a Palace Ministry to make &quot; free &quot; election possible.In short, repeated His Majesty once more, everything he had to say was alreadycontained in his written note.3. His Majesty then said that he had a question to put to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment; thus at his dictation I took down as follows :  &quot; Is the British Government prepared to choose definitely between theKing of Egypt and Nahas Pasha staying in power? &quot; When I asked forelucidation His Majesty dictated the following: &quot; this means that king farouk, apart from acting as he thinks best in the interest of his country,is thinking essentially of defending his honour.&quot;4. His Majesty added that if the answer was in favour of Nahas Pashahe trusted that our exchange of letters with the latter of 5th February, 1942,would &quot;be withdrawn.&quot; To which I replied that in such event that would presumably be a matter for Nahas Pasha&apos;s consideration.5. I said that I must crystallise His Majesty&apos;s answer into a form I couldsubmit to you. Surely he would like to ponder a little ? His Majesty said no, his reply was clear.   So I put him these two questions : (a) &quot;Are you prepared to let Nahas Pasha himself go to the country? &quot;Reply : &quot;I could not think of inviting him to go to the country atpresent owing to complete lack of free election.&quot;6.   I then put my second question (&amp;) &quot; Is Your Majesty prepared to carry on with the existing Government ? &quot;To this His Majesty replied that he must first- know the answer tothe questions he had put earlier, to His Majesty&apos;s Government.7. Pending such answer His Majesty renewed his formal undertaking thatno action should be taken meanwhile.8. His Majesty was calm and collected and friendly throughout he explained that he was absolutely detached. It was fate and not he himself whichhad made him King of Egypt and faced him with these problems.9. I pressed, him repeatedly to give an affirmative answer to me on otherpoint in War Cabinet message. He said that he had nothing to add to what hehad already stated.10. Before leaving I said that with His Majesty&apos;s permission I proposedto see Hassanein Pasha and tell him of your message and of what had passedwith him. He agreed. For account of that conversation see my immediately following telegram.!.11.   Copied to Lord Moyne and Commanders-in-Chief.From Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 810.)My immediately preceding telegram.*Hassanein Pasha, on reading your message, at once observed that he wasrelieved that resulting from it he would be absolved from shouldering theunpleasant burden of premiership. He had only agreed reluctantly to accept itin the hope that it would put Anglo-Egyptian relations upon a durable basis.2. tie seemed startled and taken aback when I read to him King Farouk&apos;squestions recorded in paragraph 3 of my immediately preceding telegram.*   I* No. (21).f No. (2).% No. (27).(27)* No. (26).
told him that I was afraid that King Farouk could not realise the extreme gravity of that question or of the consequences of the reply which His Majesty might receive tiiereto. It seemed to me only fair to His Majesty that, in reporting as 1must exactly what His Majesty had [group undecypherable : ? said] I should beable to add thai I had suggested to him, Hassanein, that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment might reasonably look for some more considered answer from His Majestyon a matter of such gravity.3. Hassanein confirmed that King Farouk would never consent to nahas pasha going to the country. To which I retorted then why not keep him in office ? There should surely be ways and means of doing that amicably withouttoo much loss of face. For example, why should not King Farouk take the line that in making his initial move to change the Government he had been unaware of [group undecypherable : ? nature of] [group undecypherable : ? impending]events so clearly indicated by drastic security measures in United Kingdom sinceannounced by the press? And that in the light of this subsequent knowledgeHis Majesty could see such a movement just now was not in the spirit of the alliance or of that co-operation with us which His Majesty had so wisely followedthis time last year.  No one wanted a row just now certainly we did not.4. Hassanein argued that this would be very difficult as everyone knew the Palace attitude. He, Hassanein, had striven to keep the clash between the palace and Wafd and to keep us out of it. He did not see how the fact couldbe disputed that it was our intervention that had once more saved the Government.How could that be known without marring relations, present and future, betweenEgypt and Great Britain ?   He was afraid of a repetition of 1919.5. I said all that should have been considered before the Palace made themistake of initiative without first sounding us. It was the Palace who hadgratuitously plunged us into this crisis : they must surely have tJhought of thepossible consequences. In any event, position now was that there was a formalmessage of the War Cabinet to King Farouk, the [group undecypherable:?delivery] on [sic:? of] which to His Majesty I should be reporting to-night.If he, Hassanein, had any reasonable suggestion to make, I should naturally beready to consider it. Meantime, let there be no talk of an ultimatum a phrasethe Pasha had used twice, only to withdraw it hurriedly when I referred him tothe terms of your message.6. I impressed upon his Excellency that if there were any further message from King Farouk I must ask to have it with the minimum delay.   For &apos;(1) you would expect it quickly; and(2) the situation might [group undecypherable : ? easily] get out of hand.And here I remonstrated with him at the apparent state of nerves at the palace as evidenced by at least two alarms they had indulged in during this week.(28)From General Wilson to Prime Minister, repeated C.I.G.S. T. 908/4.Reference your signal No. OZ 2065* of 21st April.1. I am bearing in mind the instructions which you gave during the BlackBook crisis. Especially those contained in your signal OZ 1237t of 1st May, 1943.Nevertheless I think I should inform you of possible military repercussions tothe present Egyptian crisis.2. I have just received a telegram from three Cs.-in-C, Middle East, inwhich they state that the present crisis in Egypt may result in the followingcircumstances :  Case A. If present Government goes out of office the WAFDorganisation would become hostile to us. Outbreak of strikes and riotingwould occur which would necessitate our taking over certain VPs and essential services. Egyptian Army and Air Forces would almost certainlyremain on side of law and order and continue active co-operation with us and chances are that the police would do likewise.Case B. If WAFD Government is maintained in power by means ofan ultimatum and the King abdicates or is deposed, provision must be made. to deal with possible disorders and non-co-operation in Cairo or elsewhere.Trouble must be expected in Egyptian Army and Air Force and in worsecircumstances it may become necessary to disarm them.* No. (19).f Not reproduced.
3. In the event of Case A developing, C.-in-C. Middle East would require11 Infantry Battalions or equivalent to protect VPs and communications. these troops could be found from formations at present in Middle East.4. If Case B develops, the Middle East Command would require reinforce-ments to the extent of 18 Infantry Battalions, 3 Armoured Regiments and 1 FieldRegiment. These reinforcements could not be provided from elsewhere in mediterranean theatre without seriously affecting military operations.5.   I entirely agree that we should get Greek mutinies out of the way first.New subject.6.   I am leaving for Italy to-morrow returning here 26th April.T.O.O. 211745Z22nd April. (29)From Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 815.)My telegrams Nos. 809* and 810. tShould you look for my recommendations on these two conversations, it isthat, unless in the interval more formal reply is received from King Farouk, weshould reply as soon as possible that His Majesty&apos;s question is not one to whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government feel they can be properly expected to make any reply.They note to their regret that His Majesty is adamant against inviting his prime Minister to go to the country. On the other hand, their concernregarding any decision by His Majesty to dismiss his Prime Minister, despitehis large majority in the Chamber, is already formally before His Majesty.In the circumstances and with a view to obviating exceedingly [grave (sic)&apos;\developments apprehended in the last sentence of their message of 20th April,His Majesty&apos;s Government find themselves obliged to ask for an immediate and definite reply from His Majesty in regard to his intentions,* No. (26). f No- (27)-23rd April. (30.)From Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 818.)On my instructions, His Majesty&apos;s Minister and Oriental Counsellordiscussed yesterday evening, very tentatively, details of military measures inthe event of force having to be used in emergency.2. General Stone emphasised the importance of our being assured thatNahas Pasha would fully co-operate, and that Prince Mohammed Ali would accept the succession if King Farouk were to abdicate or be deposed.3. General Stone also stressed the importance of the time factor. though he could provide guard for various essential points in Cairo by 24th April,enough troops would not be available for full military action in Cairo before27th April at the earliest. Even with the force then available there would be an element of gamble.4. General Stone said that it was desirable to decide beforehand whereKing Farouk should be sent in the event of abdication or deposition. He greatlyfavoured his being sent by air from Cairo west, as that would involve the shortestpassage through parts not in our military control. May I be informed of this?I remember that in 1942 Canada expressed willingness to take him but SouthAfrioa would be easier.(31)From Prime Minister to General Wilson.

(32)From Lord Killearn to Foreign Office.(No. 827.)Plassanein Pasha has just handed me attached message from king farouk :- &apos;&apos; In answer to War Cabinet message communicated by your Excellencyto His Majesty the King on the 21st April, I am commanded by His majesty o inform your Excellency that he has decided to leave the present Govern-ment, [group undecypherable] office for the time being.&quot;2. I asked his Excellency to thank His Majesty for this wise decision which I was sure you would receive with the greatest relief.3. I agreed, on the other hand, with his Excellency that cock-crowing on either side should be avoided. To that end I suggested that the indication thatcrisis was over had better come at first from the Palace, and we agreed thatNahas Pasha should be urged to ask for an audience at which His Majesty wouldhave a frank discussion with him, but be scrupulously gentle with him takingthe line that, whilst the conduct of the Government had not been pleasing toHis Majesty, they should now make a fresh start. King Farouk would say therehad been criticism of what the Government had been doing and he hoped thatthat would be put right. I emphasised that [group omitted : ? if ] such anaudience took place there should be no provocation by His Majesty who mustuse the utmost restraint. Being a born optimist what I still hoped for wasgenuine friendly co-operation between the two. Egypt must really show theworld that she was grown up.5. Hassanein said, that Nahas Pasha on his side must also co-operate.His Excellency urged that Nahas Pasha should cease his inflammatory [group undecypherable] [group undecypherable: ? rebellious] [group undecypherable:? speeches] and he spoke of the desirability of getting rid of Ministers of defence and Education. Of course, until the [group undecypherable]ed it was essentialthat things should first slip back into normal.6. I said that as regards the Minister of Defence he was past his work andthe Chief of the General Staff also was not up to his job. My own view was that,both should go.[group undecypherable: 1 But] I agreed that time must be allowed toarrange both palatably. As to the Minister of Education I was clear that it wasnot practical politics to expect the Government to part with their ablest member and technician. Hassanein said why not make him President of the Chamber -a suggestion which I did not follow up. i&quot;Y. We left it that I should at once see Amin Osman (Hassanein preferredthis to me going to Nahas Pasha himself at his house owing to the flutter itwould cause), tell him to inform Nahas Pasha of King Farouk&apos;s communication,impress upon Nahas Pasha importance of avoiding any cock-crowing, and endeavour to arrange Nahas Pasha should ask for audience on the lines proposed.(33) iiiFrom Prime Minister to general Wilson and General Paget.        T. 939/4.Let me know how many tanks there are in Egypt and Palestine, includingthe workshops. They need not all be battle-worthy as in most cases the work theymay have7to do will only be street demonstrations. Three or four camps of about50 each, adequately guarded, should come into being in the next week or so, say
near the Pyramids, Abbassia and other places where they cannot fail to be noticed. Interested enquirers should be told that large-scale exercises are intended in the near future. Let me know what you can do. Please don&apos;t talk interms of dozens of battalions. Let me know also about the RAP. available. Theywill not be needed except to buzz around.T.O.O. 241905Z(34)From General Wilson to Prime Minister, repeated C.I.G.S. T. 942/4.Your special unnumbered signal 231655Z.*1. Your instructions noted.

It is entirely due to theconfidence and support you once more so generously gave me.Is it not a telling commentary of our predominance that pending a reply from London neither side dared to act during the ten days ? That seems to mealmost the most striking and pleasing feature of the episode.2. Now that we have another breathing space I shall endeavour to knocktheir heads together and induce a little realism and common sense. Both sidesat this moment seem chastened and receptive.25th April. (37)From Prime Minister to Lord Killearn. T. 957/4.Bravo. I was sure you had them measured right. Tell Nahas from me thatI am expecting him to put things right between himself and the Court so thathis Government can have another fair start, and that I very much object to being drawn into internal Egyptian affairs.
