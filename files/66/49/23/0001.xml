THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY OF SUBORDINATE  LEGISLATION.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Machinery of Government Committee.1. The vast mass of legislation which will be necessary before the end of thereconstruction period will place a severe strain on the Parliamentary machine,and it will probably be desirable for the Government to formulate proposals foralterations in Parliamentary machinery in order to economise time. TheMachinery of Government Committee recently appointed a Sub-Committee of officials under the Chairmanship of the Solicitor-General to give preliminary con-sideration to the problem from this point of view.2. One way of economising time is to exclude from Bills as much detail aspossible, leaving it to be worked out subsequently by subordinate instruments. Itis, however, evident that the House of Commons would not be prepared to acceptthe extended use of this device unless the House is enabled to exercise a closerscrutiny than at present of such subordinate legislation. The tendency at present is, on the contrary, for private Members to press for as much detail as possible tobe included in Government Bills and for such subordinate instruments as are pro-vided for to be made subject to Affirmative Resolution procedure. The.Sub-Committee have accordingly presented an interim report* recommendingimproved machinery for the Parliamentary scrutiny of subordinate legislation,as a means of saving Parliamentary time in the passage of Bills.3. The Machinery of Government Committee have considered t this report,and modified the proposals in some respects, in the light not only of the problem of future Parliamentary time but also of the demand expressed in the Motion^ now on the Order Paper in the names of Mr. Molson and over 100 other Members.They now present the modified proposals for the War Cabinet&apos;s consideration, inorder that a line may be determined for the Government spokesman in the debatewhich will shortly have to. take place on Mr. Molson&apos;s Motion.Appointment and Constitution of a Scrutiny Committee.4. The Machinery of Government Committee consider that the main demandembodied in this Motion i.e., that there should be a Select Committee with theduty of scrutinising subordinate legislation should now be met. The first question is whether there should be a Joint Committee of both Houses or separateCommittees. The case for a Joint Committee is a very strong one. Appearancebefore two committees would be a serious strain on the time of officials. It wouldbe embarrassing if two Committees reported on different lines. A Joint Com-mittee would tend to acquire a corporate sense and technique of its own. There isthe further point that the House of Lords has for long had a Special OrdersCommittee which has performed its functions admirably and acquired high* M.G. (44) 7.f M.G. (44) 7th Meeting.\ &quot;That this House would welcome the setting up of a Select Committee, without powerto send for persons, papers and records, whose duty it should be to carry on a continuousexamination of all statutory rules and orders and other instruments of delegated legislationpresented to Parliament, and to report from week to week whether, in the opinion of theCommittee, any such instrument is obscure or contains matter of a controversial nature or should for any other reason be brought to the special attention of the House.&quot;Printed for the War Cabinet.

2prestige, and it would be an advantage if its traditions were carried into a joint select Committee and set from the outset a suitable standard of objective and non-partisan deliberation. It must be recognised, on the other hand, that the idea ofa Joint Committee may not commend itself to the House of Commons.5. The Machinery of Government Committee recommend that the case fora Joint Committee should be stated in the debate on behalf of the Government, butthat if there is pressure in the House of Commons for separate Committees, thedemand should be acceded to. It is possible that if there is a separate Committeein the Commons the Lords will be content with their existing Special OrdersCommittee (which is limited to instruments requiring an Affirmative Resolution).6. The Committee or Committees should in any case be set up bySessional Order, should reflect the relative strength of the parties, and, subjectto that, should be kept as small as possible. It would be for the Governmentto nominate the membership and the chairman.Evidence.7. The Motion on the Order Paper proposes that the Committee should nothave power to send for persons, papers and records. The Machinery ofGovernment Committee consider that, unless officials attend, unnecessarymisunderstandings are likely to arise and the work of the Committee will suffer.Officials should therefore attend but not Ministers. The Committee should nothave power to demand the presence of particular officials, and departmentalpapers should enjoy absolute privilege from production before the Committee.The Committee should not hear evidence from outside persons and bodies having a special interest in the subject-matter, since the proceedings would not be inthe nature of a trial or enquiry into merits.Explanatory Notes.8. In some cases the need for attendance of officials might be avoided bycirculating to the Committee notes of an informal character explainingparticular items which call for elucidation. Such notes would not be published.Adoption of this suggestion might lead to abandonment of the demand forextension of the practice of issuing footnotes to statutory rules and orders otherthan Defence Regulations.Type of Legislation to be scrutinised.9. The Sub-Committee recommended that the Committee&apos;s scrutiny shouldbe confined to subordinate legislation made under future Acts. The Machineryof Government Committee feel, on the other hand, that, though there is,much tobe said on merits for excluding from the Committee&apos;s purview subordinate legisla-tion under existing Acts, in particular the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts, anattempt to limit the proposed concession in this way would not be acceptable tothe House of Commons, and that it is better to go the whole way at once. the subordinate legislation to be referred to the Committee should include allinstruments which are made subject under the parent Act to either affirmative ornegative resolution procedure, and also other instruments which are required tobe laid before the House. Careful definition will be necessary here since thereare certain types of instrument, particularly under existing Acts, which no one would suggest as suitable for scrutiny by the Committee. The criterion to beadopted would be such that the decision whether particular regulations underfuture Acts should or should not be subject to scrutiny would be made byParliament in passing the parent Act.Scope of Scrutiny.10. The function of the Committee would be to assist private Members indischarging their duty of keeping a watch on subordinate legislation made bythe executive, by enabling private members as a whole to know which out of thevast mass of subordinate instruments call for special attention. It would therefore not be for the Committee to pronounce upon the merits of the policylying behind the subordinate legislation in question. The precise terms ofreference will require further consideration when the sense of the House hasbeen taken, but the Machinery of Government Committee consider that the
functions of the Scrutinising Committee might be defined by requiring them toreport to each House on whether the subordinate legislation-(1) Imposes a charge on the public revenues or contains provisions requiringpayments to be made to the Exchequer or any Government Depart-ment or to any Local or Public Authority in consideration of anylicence or consent or any services to be rendered, or prescribes theamount of any such charge or payment.(2) Is made in pursuance of an enactment containing specific provisionsexcluding it from challenge in the Courts, either at all times or afterthe expiration of a specified period.(3) Contains any matter so foreign to the intention of Parliament inconferring the enabling power that the attention of Parliament oughtto be drawn to it.(4) Comprises any other special feature to which the attention of Parliamentought to be drawn.The Machinery of Government Committee do not consider that the purelylegal question whether or not the subordinate legislation is intra vires should as such be referred to the Committee. That question must remain one for theCourts.Procedure in Parliament.11. The Scrutinising Committee would present its report to both Houseswithin the time-limit for moving a negative resolution or for passing an affirmative resolution (normally 40 days excluding adjournments of more than four days). No change in Parliamentary procedure thereafter is recommended.In the case of negative resolutions no further action would follow unless a prayerwere moved by a Member. A debate on the affirmative or negative resolution orother suitable occasion, in the light of the Scrutinising Committee&apos;s report, wouldbe the stage at which policy would be debated and the Minister, uncommitted byany previous appearance before the Scrutinising Committee, would make hisexplanation.Effect of proposal on use of Affirmative Resolutions.12. A concession on these lines would make it possible for the Governmentto resist demands for affirmative resolutions in future legislation in all but very exceptional cases. There would no longer be any question of subordinate legislation escaping the notice of private Members and, from the point of viewof the private Member opposed to a particular subordinate instrument, negative resolution procedure is fully as effective as affirmative resolution procedure.13. These recommendations differ in some respects from those of the donoughmore Committee of 1932, when, however, the circumstances were widelydifferent from to-day, and also from the arrangements for the existing Houseof Lords Special Orders Committee (which, for instance, is required to considerthe question of vires and also whether any &quot; matter of principle &quot; is involved-a phrase which the Machinery of Government Committee consider too elasticfor inclusion in the proposed Scrutinising Committee&apos;s terms of reference). TheCommittee consider, however, that the differences are defensible and that therecommendations taken as a whole reasonably meet the demand put forward by large sections of the House of Commons without sensibly hampering the executive in the proper exercise of its powers.14. It is to be emphasised in conclusion that these recommendations arein no way connected with the question whether, as a matter of principle, extensiveuse of delegated legislation is or is not a good thing, or whether closer control byParliament over delegated legislation is or is not desirable. They proceed on the purely practical considerations, first that, whether it is desirable or not, future legislation will be of such a scope and nature that subordinate legislationthereunder will inevitably be on a far larger scale than ever hitherto, and second,that the passage through Parliament of both the parent and the subordinate legislation will be constantly opposed and obstructed, and Parliamentary timebecome seriously clogged, unless the Government make some such concession asthe Scrutinising Committee recommended above. :Of/ices of the War Cabinet, S.
