THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.SECRET. Copy No,W.P. (M) 213.19th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.EGYPT.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.I circulate herewith, for consideration by the War Cabinet, a note by theForeign Office on the political crisis which has arisen in Egypt and is described in recent telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador.W. S. C.19th April, 1944.Note.. In May of last year King Farouk endeavoured to get rid of Nahas Pashaand his Government on the ground that they had been shown by the famousso-called &quot; Black Book &quot; (published by one of Nahas&apos; ex-Ministers) to be corruptand unworthy to continue in office. His Majesty&apos;s Government were unimpressedby these charges; they regarded a change of regime as definitely undesirablehaving regard to the war situation and the loyalty of Nahas to the.Allied cause;and they advised King Farouk who accepted their advice to retain his PrimeMinister in office and to collaborate with him.2. This collaboration has proved increasingly difficult. For his part nahas pasha has continued to work loyally with us; but his administration has deteriorated and in particular mismanaged supplies, with a consequent loss of ameasure of public support, though it remains the only party with a substantialpublic following. The King has now, without warning, confronted us withwritten proposals that he should dismiss Nahas and install in his place a Govern-ment composed of His Majesty&apos;s nominees to conduct a so-called, &quot; free election.&quot;The charges against Nahas are corruption, maladministration and an attemptto usurp the King&apos;s position and prerogatives. While there may be substance in some of these charges (though probably little in the last) we do not considerthat they should be used at this stage of the war to oust Nahas Pasha and launchEgypt on a period of political uncertainty under Royal auspices.3. Lord Killearn has indicated his preference for a policy of insisting, by force if necessary, on the retention of Nahas in power, though he warns us that conditions are less favourable to such a policy than in 1942. Having regard to the undoubted fall in Nahas Pasha&apos;s stock in the country, and to the fact that thequestions at issue are largely those of Egyptian internal politics, we feel that every effort should first be made by oral representation to dissuade His Majestyfrom his present course; and that as an alternative to a blunt refusal of his present proposals we should&apos;urge on him the necessity of preparing for a generalelection, conducted by the present Government, though with such safeguards of freedom of voting as His Majesty may desire to suggest.Foreign Office, 17th April, 1944.12345   [27305]
