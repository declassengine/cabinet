(44) 83)27th April, 1944WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 243)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 20th April, to0700 27th April,1944[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Copy No./n/Cabinet War Room
naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   There has been considerable activity in the Channel.Carrier-borne aircraft have successfully attacked shipping off the norwegian coast.Norwegian Waters.2. Early on the 26th, aircraft from H.M. ships Victorious, Furious, Searcher,Emperor, Pursuer and Striker, covered by ships of the Home Fleet, attacked asouthbound convoy off Bodb. All four ships of the convoy and one of the escortswere damaged. No enemy aircraft were encountered but there was considerableA/A fire.  Five aircraft are missing but one of the pilots is safe.On the 22nd, the Norwegian S/M Via torpedoed a 2,000-ton ship in convoy off the Naze.Home Waters.3. There have been indications of increased enemy interest in the channel and East Coast areas. There has been a steady movement of enemy tank landing craft westward through the Strait of Dover; aerial reconnaissance has beencarried out all round the coast from Sea pa to Plymouth, and activity by enemylight naval forces has considerably increased.4. On the night of the 18th/19th H.M.S. Stevenstone (destroyer) and twoM.T.Bs. attacked and damaged a number of E-boats which were, operating off the isle of Wight. Others were driven off by H.M.S. Montrose (destroyer) east ofCromer. One M.T.B. was damaged during an inconclusive engagement with fiveE-boats off Start Point early on the 22nd. On the night of the 23rd/24th three groups of E-boats operated off Beachy Head. M.T.Bs. engaged one group, and h.M.S. Campbell (destroyer), escorting a coastal convoy, engaged another group and claimed to have inflicted damage. Later H.M.S. Halsted (frigate), escortingships in tow of tugs, engaged a third group. The enemy&apos;s only success was in sink-ing a Dutch tug. On the same night four M.T.Bs., patrolling north of Cherbourg,were heavily engaged by three torpedo-boats, and later three M.T.Bs. patrollingoff Barfleur attacked three destroyers, two of which were hit. One M.T.B. was sunk, and there were ten killed, four wounded and 17 missing.On the night of the 25th/26th H:M. ships Black Prince (cruiser) and Ashanti(destroyer) with H.M. Canadian destroyers Athabaskan, Haida and Huronattacked three Elbing class destroyers off the north coast of Brittany and sank oneof them. All of our destroyers sustained minor damage; one rating was killed and one officer and four ratings were wounded. Ashanti and Huron collided afterthe action, but were not seriously damaged.5. On the evening of the 20th Dover batteries opened fire on a north-bound convoy and claimed four straddles. The convoy subsequently entered Dunkirk.Return fire from enemy batteries did no serious damage.On the evening of the 22nd the Naval Air Station at Dundee was attacked byone enemy aircraft.   One Walrus was damaged but there were no casualties.Mediterranean. /6. During the week ending the 25th, 15,395 tons of supplies were unloadedat Anzio.Early on the 20th the U.S. destroyer Eberle intercepted four E-boats off Anzio; one E-boat was sunk and another damaged. On the 21st the U.S.destroyer Davis shot down an enemy aircraft.. Early on the 21st humantorpedoes made an abortive attack on shipping at Anzio. The torpedoes usedwere of a new type based on a normal 21-inch torpedo fitted with a dome control in place of a warhead; to this torpedo is clamped a second 21-inch torpedo whichis released as required by the occupant of the dome. One of these &quot;mothertorpedoes &quot; was recovered, four torpedoes were washed, ashore, and six were destroyed by patrol craft. Four German prisoners were captured. On the night of the 24th/25th coastal forces operating south of Leghorn sank four enemylanding craft, three lighters and a tug.  On the same night two enemy destroyers
operating in the same area were damaged in our minefield, and coastal forces and aircraft later sank one of them.On the 20th the US. destroyer Lansdale, escorting an eastbound US. convoyeast of Algiers, was sunk by aircraft. :On the night of the 22nd/23rd enemy light forces bombarded Bastia but no damage was done.7.   The Dutch S/M Dolfijn sank two caiques in the iEgean.On the 23rd, loyal Greeks boarded the disaffected corvettes Apostolis and.Saktouris and the destroyer lerax at Alexandria; the mutineers surrenderedafter a short resistance. At Port Said the cruiser Giorgios Averoff has not yetW been subdued.East Indies.8. The situation in the Bombay docks has materially improved. TheAlexandra dock is working normally and clearance at the Prince&apos;s and. Victoriadocks is proceeding satisfactorily.9. On the 14th H.M. S/M Storm torpedoed and probably sank an escorted3,500-ton ship off the Andaman Islands. On the following day she fired twotorpedoes at a 4,000-ton ship escorted by a destroyer and two other vessels;the destroyer was sunk and it is possible that the cargo ship was hit.Anti-Submarine Operations.10. Of the 12 attacks reported during the week six were made by shore-based aircraft and six by warships. The only successful attack was carried out by theNorwegian S/M Ula, which sank a U-boat off the Norwegian coast.Enemy Intelligence.11. It is considered that all the German heavy ships which are operative inthe Baltic have now completed working up.12. A survey of German naval shipbuilding (excluding U-boats) in Germanshipyards and in those in occupied territories since - the end of 1942 shows that20 destroyers (7 Narvik class, 12 Elbing class and one Tjerk Heddes class),26 escort vessels, 94 minesweepers and 42 tank landing craft have been completed,and that 14 destroyers, 8 escort vessels, 13 minesweepers and 33 tank landing craftare under construction. In addition, about 20 cargo ships have been convertedand commissioned as sperrbrechers since September 1942. No warship larger than a destroyer is being completed at present but destroyer building has beenspeeded up. German yards are maintaining their output of small naval craft and the building of tank landing craft has recently been resumed.U-boats.13. The week has been a very quiet one in all areas. Up to six U-boats are on passage from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean and three are patrolling betweenFreetown and Lagos. About 12 U-boats are operating on the convoy route toN. Russia.Enemy Attack on Shipping.14. One ship, a straggler from a homeward-bound convoy, was torpedoedby a U-boat in the N.W. Approaches. On the 20th, east of Algiers, two ships were sunk and two were damaged in an eastbound US. convoy whichwas attacked by about 25 aircraft, and one ship was sunk by aircraft whilst in convoy from Corsica; three aircraft were destroyed. A U.S. ship was damaged,probably by a mine, off Anzio.Protection of Seaborne Trade.15.   During the week ending the 23rd, 881 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations.   Of these, 249 were in ocean convoys and 632 in British coastal[27356]- b
convoys. Two escort carriers, 60 destroyers (including 24 U.S. destroyers) and94 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Three homeward-bound convoys, consisting of 125 ships, and three outward-bound convoys, consisting of 124 ships, reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.16.   Mines have been laid by surface craft off the French and Dutch coasts.Aircraft laid mines in the Baltic and the Heligoland Bight, and off theDutch and French coasts and Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.17. E-boats were operating off the S.E. coast on three occasions during theweek but there is no evidence of minelaying. On two nights aircraft weresuspected of minelaying between the Humber and the Thames Estuary and on one night off Portsmouth. Ten ground mines were destroyed off the Norfolkcoast; 14 moored mines were destroyed off the Dorset coast and 18 in the easternapproach channel to Portsmouth. The mine totals are 4,760 ground, 4.598moored.18. Between the 11th and 16th, 23 moored mines were destroyed in theStrait of Bonifacio. A small dangerous area off Bastia was declared on the 25th.Enemy aircraft were suspected of minelaying off Anzio on the night ofthe 22nd/23rd. From the 15th to 23rd, 36 mines were destroyed in theAnzio-Naples area. On the 23rd H.M.S. Circe (minesweeper) was damaged bya mine and was towed into Naples.Enemy Merchant Shipping.19. During March, 14 enemy ships, totalling 21,523 tons, were sunk or captured or became total losses; of these, five ships of 5,938 tons were casualties in the Mediterranean. In addition four ships of 23,529 tons were seriously damaged.Two German ships, believed to be the tankers Meocphalte (2,578 tons) andS-pramea) (2,560 tons), have succeeded in passing up the Channel and wererecently located at Dieppe and Flushing respectively.During the week four of the larger ships and a number of the smaller ships were reported to have entered or cleared from Bilbao. One Spanish and three german ships have been active in the ore trade between Sagunto and Barcelona.Danube Traffic.20. The following figures give some idea of the quantity of internationaltraffic handled at the various ports in Germany and Austria through which theRiver Danube flows, and which has been adversely affected by recent Alliedminelaying.The principal upstream traffic consists of agricultural and petroleum products and minerals exported from Turkey, Bulgaria, Rumania, yugoslavia and Hungary, and bound for Bratislava (Czechoslovakia), Austria and Germany,the density of traffic reaching its peak between Budapest and Bratislava. imports into Austria from the Lower Danube amount annually to some 570,000 tons, ofwhich half are petroleum products, whilst exports up the river from formerAustrian ports consist of 55,000 tons of agricultural products, timber and miscellaneous goods, of which 30,000 tons are loaded in Bratislava and 20,000 tonsin Vienna.Imports entering Germany at Passau during the current year amounted to1,334,000 tons, including 500,000 tons of minerals. Ratisbon (Regensburg), inBavaria, is the most active port on the river, and as the furthest point which canbe reached by large barges it is of great importance as a transhipment centre.Imports entering Austria from Germany are estimated at 350,000 tons,including 120,000 tons for Vienna, 30,000 for other Austrian ports, and200,000 tons for Bratislava and beyond. They consist of iron and steel products,fertilisers, salt, cellulose and manufactured goods. Cargoes loaded in Austriafor downstream ports total 70,000 tons, nearly all from Vienna, which, as thebusiest port in Austria, has extensive facilities for the storage and refining of oil.
Losses due to Allied minelaying are reported to have caused the cessation of passenger traffic in the Hungarian section of the river.Royal Australian Navy.21. The strength of the R.A.N. at the beginning of the war was : Two 8-in.cruisers, four 6-in. cruisers, five destroyers and two escort vessels; manned by5,440 officers and men.In April 1944 the strength was: Two 8-in. cruisers, two 6-in. cruisers,ten destroyers (including six manned by R.A.N. for R.N.), two frigates, threeescort vessels, 29 auxiliary A/S and M/S vessels, one minelayer, and over 90miscellaneous craft. In addition 60 minesweepers have been built in Australia,36 for the R.A.N., 20 for the R.N., manned by the R.A.N., and four for theRoyal Indian Navy.On 29th February, 1944, R.A.N. personnel consisted of 8,615 members of thepermanent naval forces, 25,299 reservists, and 1,810 members of the Women&apos;royal Australian Naval Service; totalling 35,724.The &quot; Queen Mary &quot; and &quot; Queen Elizabeth.&quot;22. Since May 1942 these two liners have been employed mainly on the atlantic troop ferry service. They have both made over 20 voyages on this route and have carried respectively 339,730 and 344,741 service personnel. Duringthe earlier part of the war, when they were based on Sydney (Australia), theycarried 104,952 personnel. Their total carryings up to March 1944 are 789,423personnel, and the total mileages steamed are 403,835 and 301,684 respectively.23. Tthe state of the Allied Navies on the 1st April, 1944, is shown inAppendix A.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.Northern and Central Sectors.24. S.W. of Narva the Germans have made a number of fairly heavy localattacks, presumably with the intention of eliminating the Russian bridgeheadacross the River Narva. Although they claim to have made some progress theRussians state that these German attacks have been repulsed.Southern Sector.25. Enemy pressure has been maintained in the area east and S.E. ofStanislavov, where the Germans are attacking the right flank of the Russiansalient which reaches forward into the Carpathians as far as the Czechoslovakfrontier. The Germans no doubt hope to force the Russians to withdraw before they have time to consolidate their recently won territory. A successful german attack here would serve the double purpose of reducing the danger of a russian advance westwards north of the Carpathians and of weakening the Russianposition further south, in Rumania. There is probably some truth in theGerman claims to have made progress in their attacks, in which Hungarianforces have also taken part, but they have not succeeded in forcing any generalRussian withdrawal from the salient.Crimea.26. There has been no change in the position in the Crimea, although theGermans have reported strong Russian attacks at Sebastopol on the 24th.Evacuation of German and Rumanian troops has apparently begun, but for thetime being, at least, the enemy can be expected to do everything in his powerto prevent a Russian breakthrough. Whether any attempt will be made to holdSebastopol indefinitely remains to be seen, It would be extremely difficult, butthe Germans might think that the possibility of denying the port to the Russianswas worth the risks involved.[273561
General.27. A comparative lull has settled over the greater part of the front. Nodoubt this is due largely to the Russians&apos; need to re-group their forces and to reorganise their communications after their recent rapid advance.Italy.28.   The general lull prevailing over all the Italian fronts has continued.In the Adriatic sector there has been the usual patrolling and small-scaleactivity from both sides. Artillery and mortar fire, including the renewed use by the enemy of propaganda shells, are reported.In the Cassino area there has been no change. During the night of the21st/22nd strong enemy artillery fire was directed on Highway 6; on the 23rd,considerable enemy movement seen west of the town was engaged by our artillery and mortars; we also succeeded in destroying an enemy ammunition dump by gunfire.In the bridgehead U.S. forces S.E. and S.W. of Cisterna have improved their position in minor operations against stiff enemy resistance. An enemy counter-attack in company strength was successfully repulsed by U.S. forces and anattempt to infiltrate into our positions was held south of Carroceta.Yugoslavia.29. A German offensive started in the S.W. on about the 10th. Afterclearing the lines of communication from Sarajevo to Hercegovina, the enemythrust into Partisan-held territory in Montenegro from the N.E. and S.W. the partisans have counter-attacked strongly and the fighting continues.Considerable battles have continued in the Jajce (Bosnia) area and to theN.E. near Bihac (Croatia).Between the 22nd and the 24th Partisan forces supported by Commando andU.S. special forces carried out successful raids on the islands of Mljet andKorcula. Enemy casualties amounted to 393 killed, and 505 German prisoners were taken; Partisan forces sustained 55 killed and 250 wounded. The raidingparties were subsequently evacuated with much booty; enemy forces have returnedto Mljet.Greece.30. German drives have been reported throughout the Peloponnese, whereE.L A.S. forces have apparently offered little or no resistance, and in Macedoniaand Thessaly.The reduction in German strength in Greece and Yugoslavia appears to have resulted, perhaps as a measure of defence, in a general increase of activity bytheir remaining forces.Burma.A arakan.31. The Japanese have made several attacks upon our positions on theMaungdaw-Buthidaung road. These have all been repulsed and mostly at a heavy cost to the attackers. On the 24th our troops attacked Japanese positionssouth of the road, and made a slight advance. West African troops have movedsouth-westwards from the Kaladan Valley. They now occupy&apos;a village fromwhich the enemy has been cleared, eight miles east of Buthidaung.Chin Hills and Chindwin.32. Our troops have made some progress along the road to Ukhrul. In theBishenpur area attacks on our forces have been repulsed, and enemy attempts topass round the western flank of our positions south of Imphal have thus beenfrustrated. During the night the 23rd/24th Japanese attacks made against our positions north of Imphal have also been repulsed and we have gained furtherground. After a lull, enemy activity has increased in the Kohima area. Heavyhand-to-hand fighting is reported to have taken place in the town on the 23rd.
Long-Range Penetration Groups.33. The Long-Range Penetration Groups are continuing their guerrillaactivities. Their main recent successes have been the destruction of two railway bridges S.W. of Indaw; one bridge on the Bhamo-Myitkyina road; a bridge onthe Banmauk-Mansi road, and the mining of a long stretch of road and railwaybetween Mawlu and Indaw.New Guinea.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)34. On the morning of the 22nd Allied forces carried out successful landingsat Hollandia (about 400 miles N.W. of Madang), Tanahmerah Bay (28 miles .W. of Hollandia), and Aitape (220 miles west of Madang). The landings,which were preceded by air and naval bombardments, encountered little initialresistance. The townships of Hollandia and Aitape are already in U.S. hands and three airfields near Hollandia are now heing used by our aircraft. Thelandings were carried out under the close support of the U.S. South Pacific fleet and an Australian squadron.Australian troops have entered Madang.AIR SITUATION.General Review.35. Home-based aircraft continued their heavy attacks on enemy targets inGermany and Occupied Territory.In Italy, heavy attacks have been maintained on enemy railways.U.S. heavy bombers have attacked aircraft factories at Vienna, and railway centres at Bucharest and Ploesti.In Burma, a high scale of effort has been directed on targets in the areas ofImphal and Kohima.In New Guinea, Allied aircraft heavily bombed airfields and communications.United Kingdom.36. In daylight, only one enemy aircraft was reported overland; this aircraft flew over the Isle of Wight and was destroyed by a Spitfire as it came in to land at Maupertus airfield.On the night of the 20th/21st, about 50 enemy aircraft operated over theEast Coast and, in the early morning, a further ten came in over East Anglia.Two nights later, eight enemy.aircraft, operating as intruders off the East Coast,destroyed seven returning Liberators. On the night 23rd/&apos;24th, of about90 long-range bombers off the South Coast, 70 made landfall over coastal districts.On the following night, a few enemy aircraft operated over eastern counties. Onthe night 25th/26th, about 100 long-range bombers operated off the south coast: about 60 of these made landfall. On the next night, about 35 enemy aircraft operated over South Coastal districts and two over East Anglia. during these operations 11 enemy aircraft were shot down.At night, several enemy reconnaissance aircraft flew over Northern Scotland;one of these was shot down off Wick. A number of others operated in daylightoff the South Coast.Home Waters.37. On the 20th, a Wellington, operating off the coast of Holland, obtained a bomb hit on a 2,000-ton ship and left her seriously damaged and on fire. In the evening, a force of 24 Beaufighters attacked a 2,000-ton ship and four escort vessels off Borkum; the ship was torpedoed and sunk and three of the escortswere damaged.   One Beaufighter is missing.Early on the 23rd, a Wellington attacked several E-boats off Ijmuiden,damaging at least two. Two hours later, a Wellington attacked a convoy of11 ships off nor deney; one ship received a direct hit and was set on fire.On the night of the 24th/25th, a Wellington attacked and possibly damage done of seven small ships off Ijmuiden. On the 26th, Beaufighters attacked a convoy off the Frisian Islands; one ship was torpedoed and blew up, one escort vessel was set on fire, and other ships and escorts were hit with cannon fire.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 274 were despatched, laid 837 sea-mines in enemy waters for the loss of six aircraft.

Over 2,300 tons of bombs were dropped on military objectives in Northern France, 940 tons on railway targets in France and Belgium,811 tons on coastal defences, and 185 tons on other targets, including six airfields,river bridges and a radar installation. In addition, nearly 1,000 rocket projectileswere fired at the same targets. Fifteen bombers and seven fighters are missing and nine enemy aircraft were destroyed.Night.39.

Photographs have since been taken of Cologne, Paris/La Chapelle, Ottignies,Lens, dusseldorf, Brunswick and Laon, and the results of the attacks are givenin Appendix VII.Over Karlsruhe, there was 5/10th to 10/10ths cloud. Reports indicate that afair weight of the attack fell on the town, although there was a tendency, in the later stages, for the attack to spread to the north and west. The attack on Munichwas carried out in good visibility. The markers were accurately placed and therewas a good concentration of bombing. Two Mosquitoes, engaged on reconnais-sance, reported very large fires burning.At Essen, there was good visibility with slight haze. The bombing wasaccurate and concentrated, and large fires quickly developed. At Schweinfurt,the weather was clear, but a smoke screen was in operation. Reports indicate thatthe bombing was somewhat scattered. At Villeneuve St. Georges, the visibilitywas good over the southern aiming point, where a good concentration of bombingwas achieved, but over the northern aiming point visibility was hampered bysmoke and haze, and results were not so good.Small-scale attacks were made on the permanent-way depot at Chambly, nearParis, and on the German Air Force signals equipment depot at Vilvorde, nearBrussels.   One aircraft is missing.Mosquitoes, of which 434 were despatched, bombed Berlin, Hamburg,Cologne, dusseldorf and Mannheim, provided bomber support and carried outintruder patrols. One hundred aircraft dropped leaflets on towns in France,Holland and Belgium. Eight enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of sixMosquitoes and one Wellington.Italy.40. In all operational theatres covered by the island .A .F. up to the 25th A pril,Allied aircraft flew a total of 11,204 sorties for the loss of 77 aircraft; 132 enemy aircraft were destroyed.The main Allied bombing effort was directed upon enemy communications,and, in particular, on railways and bridges.The principal weight of attack on communications was provided by medium,light and fighter-bombers, the heavies being largely engaged on other targets;however, Fortresses and Liberators made successful attacks on the railway yards at Ancona, Mestre, Parma (56 miles N.N.E. of Spezia), Ferrara (56 miles SW.of Venice), Padua and in the Trieste area; several bridges were also attacked.The lighter aircraft carried out a great number of attacks in the Rome area,Central and Eastern Italy. Maurauders made several very effective attacks onviaducts and bridges, the heaviest of these being in the Poggibonsi area, and near Florence at Incisa in Valdarno. Mitchells and Baltimores carried outheavy attacks on railway centres and bridges in Central Italy, some of theprincipal targets being in the Orvieto and Aquila areas, and at Piombino.Further attacks in Central Italy and in the area around Rome were made ona very extensive scale by Thunderbolts, Invaders, war hawks and Kittyhawks,on railway centres, tracks and bridges. In Eastern Italy, similar operations were carried out but on a somewhat lighter scale. As a result of these attacks manyrailway tracks were cut, bridges and viaducts either hit or the approachesblocked, and a number of locomotives, wagons and M.T. destroyed.U.S. heavies attacked shipping at Venice, dropping 138 tons on dock and harbour installations, and other targets in the Trieste area, where about 280 tons were dropped, and an aircraft factory (259 tons) at Turin, where buildings and hangars were hit. At night, small scale attacks were made on the harbour at genoa by Liberators, and Wellingtons bombed the docks at Leghorn, San Stefanoand Piombino, Beaufighters severely damaged a 2,000-ton ship in the gulf of Lions and another off Perpignan, and shipping was attacked off Elba andLeghorn. A large number of dumps, some of which were completely destroyed,were attacked, and enemy positions and guns bombed. The airfields at Rieti,Perugia and Foligno were attacked by 48 Kittyhawks, and the landing-groundat Canino (18 miles W.N.W. of Viterbo) by 24 Invaders; 31 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground, 16 damaged and a further two shot down while taking off.In operations over Italy, medium, light and fighter-bombers flew a total of3,500 sorties, for the loss of 16 aircraft.On the night 24th/25th, about 35 enemy aircraft attacked Naples city andCapodichino airfield. A number of wagons were damaged, but no shipping was affected, and there were no military casualties.   One enemy aircraft was shot
down by AA.   A few other enemy aircraft attacked military targets in theAnzio area.Yugoslavia and Albania.41. Many attacks were made on enemy shipping; several merchant vessels,schooners, barges, and a large motor launch were damaged. Other effectiveattacks were made on bridges, radar stations, dumps, and M.T., and about250 barrels of petrol were set on fire. Severed locomotives were destroyed and anumber of railway wagons damaged; an aircraft factory at Belgrade was bombed by 19 Fortresses.Austria.42. On the 23rd, 521 escorted U.S. heavy bombers, based on Italy, attackedaircraft factories and airfields in the Vienna district at Wiener/Neustadt,Wien/Schwechat and Bad Voslau. A total of 1,143 tons of bombs was dropped and photographs show that very severe damage was done. A number ofworkshops and other buildings were either demolished or considerably damaged,and over 40 aircraft on the ground were either destroyed or damaged. during these operations, about 150 enemy fighters were encountered, of which 47 were shot down.   Sixteen heavy bombers and four escorting fighters were lost.Rumania.43. On the 21st, 86 escorted Liberators bombed the railway centre atBucharest, dropping 189 tons; results could not be observed. About 60 enemy fighters were encountered, of which 20 were destroyed; five U.S. heavies and oneescorting Lightning are missing. On the same day, 27 Liberators bombed therail centre at Turnul-Severin; escorting Mustangs shot down 15 enemy fighters;one Liberator and four Mustangs are missing.On the 24th, the railway yards at Bucharest were attacked by 213 escortedLiberators; 390 tons were dropped and excellent results are reported.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Brunswick. An immediate interpretation of photographs (which do not cover the central and western portion of the city) taken on the 24th April, afterthe attack of the 22nd/23rd April, shows that in the region south of the citycentre considerable damage has been done in the business and residential area.In the south-eastern marshalling yards, there have been many hits, and, in one area, repairs are already being undertaken. Industrial damage includes theworks of Vereinigte Eisenbahn-Signalwerk A.G. (Priority 2) railway equip-ment, which has suffered heavily.dusseldorf. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the24th April shows that, as a result of the attack on the 22nd/23rd April, furthersevere damage has been caused.    The Rheinmetall-Borsig A.G.  plant atDerendorf (Priority 1 -I--finished guns, gun turrets, &amp;c.) has suffered heavily,and the hydraulic power station, the drop forge and press, a foundry, machineshops and assembly shops, are among the buildings and the works affected.Other   plants   severely   damaged   include   Schiess  Defries   A.G. Oberbilk(Priority 1 H--machine tools, magnetic mines); Mannesman Rohrenwerke A.G.Rath (Priority 1 iron and steel tubes); Press and Walzwerk A.G. (Priority 2 ;steel, pressed and rolled goods). There have been many direct hits in theDiisseldorf-Derendorf marshalling yards and damage has been done to rolling-stock and buildings as well as railways. A considerable amount of furtherbusiness and residential damage has been caused, though the earlier devastationleft little to be destroyed in the centre of the town.Erding. Photographs taken on the 24th April show that, as a result of the attack earlier in the day, two large hangars have been severely damaged, offices,blocks or living quarters almost completely destroyed and a large central hangardamaged. The south-west area is largely obscured by smoke, but it can be seenthat large fires are still burning in hangars and workshops and storage buildings.At least seven medium and six small aircraft have been destroyed or damagedon the ground.Landsberg Airfield. Photographs taken on the 24th April about two hoursafter the attack, show that, of the seven large hangars, one has been destroyed,two others very severely damaged and a further two damaged less severely. Sixother buildings, including workshops and barracks, Were still on fire. Therailway track serving the hangars has been cut in many places and seven aircraft on the ground have been damaged.Oberpfajfenhofen. While photographs, taken on the 23rd April after the fighter attack on the 5th April and the bomber attack on the 13th April, showthat only slight damage was done to buildings, photographs taken during the attack indicate that 19 aircraft on the ground were destroyed or damaged.Photographs taken on the 24th April after the attack earlier in the day,show many buildings still burning. In the northern dispersal area, two of thethree large hangars have been destroyed and a large assembly shop previouslydamaged has now collapsed. In the western dispersal area, damaged buildingsinclude two large assembly hangars which have suffered severely. preliminary examination shows that 18 aircraft on the ground have been destroyed by fireor direct hits, while four more were still burning, and, as many more aircraft are seen near bomb craters, it is likely that an additional number may be damaged.Schweinfurt. Photographs taken on the 24th April show, that, as the resultof the attack on the 13th April, two of the five ball-bearing works have receivedfurther damage. The Kugelischer Works has received two direct hits on anundamaged machine shop and additional destruction to two others. other buildings have been damaged. At the V.K.F. Werke II severe damage has beendone to the possible assembly or machine shop at the eastern end of the plant.Further commercial and residential damage has been done in the town.Friedrichshafen. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F.- attack on the24th April, show that considerable damage has been inflicted on the works ofZahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen A.G. (gears for aircraft engines) and on the
Dornier Werke assembly plant and airfield at Lowenthal. At the first-named, atleast nine buildings, including the gear-cutting machine shop, another largemachine shop, the alloys shop and the press shop, have been damaged.At Lowenthal, the large assembly shop has been very severely damaged over half its area and buildings affected round the airfield include two large hangars,two workshops, and at least 13 small buildings and huts, while a large block whichprobably forms the main administrative and office building has been badly damaged by fire. In addition, there are more than 170 fresh, craters, on the landing ground.Some business and residential damage has been caused in the vicinity of bothplants and the main railway line to Ulm has received at least four direct hits. ;- Immediately to the N.W. of the Zahnradfabrik works, an unidentified %industrial plant has been heavily damaged.Photographs taken during the attack indicate that four aircraft on the,landing ground were damaged.Aachen. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken after the attack on the 11th/12th April, shows that severe damage and destruction has been caused in the centre of the city and in the districts to the west and south-west.Damage to railway property is particularly severe. In the main station andsidings (priority 2), the passenger station has been 75 per cent, destroyed, thelocomotive sheds 50 per cent, destroyed, and the goods depot 25 per cent,destroyed. Several sheds have been damaged or wrecked, rolling stock has beenderailed and damaged and two trains have been burnt out. In the othermarshalling yards (priority 1) to the west of the city, two large shops have been partly destroyed and more rolling stock destroyed and derailed. Industrial,business and residential damage is considerable throughout the city. In thesouth whole streets have been devastated, and several factories have been destroyed.Berlin I Erkner. Interpretation of photographs taken on the 19th April,shows that damage resulting from the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 8th March is very severe. The V.K.F. ball-bearing factory has suffered heavily and nearly everybuilding in the works has received some degree of damage, much of it severe.The plants of Rutgerswerke A.G. (tar, chemicals and explosives) and BakeliteG.m.b.H. (raw materials for plastics) have also been severely damaged. Inaddition, there is heavy residential damage in the town and the railway station and engine shed have been badly affected.Berlin/ Wildau.-A final interpretation of photographs, taken on the19th April, confirms and elaborates the damage to Berliner Maschinenbau A.G.caused by the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 8th March. The bolt and tool manufactoryhas been almost entirely destroyed, and buildings damaged in varying degreeinclude the forge, two mechanical shops (partly destroyed) and several locomotiveshops.  There is also some residential damage in the area.Bernburg. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the19th April, after.the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 11th April, shows that an assemblyshop and several smaller buildings of Junkers Flugzeug Motorenwerke A.G.(Ju.88 assembly) have been damaged. Two aircraft shelters on the airfield havebeen severely damaged by direct hits and taxi-tracks have received nine or tenhits. Photographs, taken during the attack, show two aircraft on the groundon fire and indicate that 13 more were probably damaged. .CoblenzjMosel Marshalling Yard. Damage resulting from the U.S.A.A.F.attack on the 19th April is seen on photographs taken later on the same day.The engine shed has received at least three direct hits and a medium-sized shednearby has been damaged. The tracks west of the engine shed have receivedten direct hits and the spur three direct hits. There is some residential damage nin the area. . ,Cologne.-Photographs, taken the morning after the attack on the 20th/21stApril, show the greater part of the city obscured by smoke. It can, however, beseen that fires were burning in the Gereon marshalling yard. In Ehrenfeld, fourfactories and the gasworks, and in Unsfeld, two factories and the tram depot,were damaged or still burning.; Photographs obtained after the smoke had cleared, show damage to beheaviest in the Ehrenfeld district, where many factories have suffered severe damage. Further industrial damage has been caused in the east and north-east of the city centre. The city centre itself has been almost entirely devastated. Thecathedral has not been damaged. !, .
Gutersloh Airfield. Photographs show that, as a result of the U.S.A.A.F.attack on the 19th April, the most extensive damage was caused to a group ofbarracks, office and stores huts north-east of the main airfield buildings. . slight damage has been done to one hangar. A direct hit has cut the railway trackthrough the airfield building area and derailed several trucks; there are about60 craters spread across the landing-ground from east to west-Kassel. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the20th April, after the U.S.A A.F. attack on the 19th April, shows that the aircraftcomponents plant of Fiesler Flugzeugbau G.m.b.H. at Bettenhausen (F.W. 190)has been severely damaged. All three machine shops had been hit and have suffered heavily, and nearly every building has received some damage.The adjacent works of Spinnfaser A.G. (priority 1+ and the largestmanufacturer of textile yarns from staple fibre in Europe) has also been severely damaged and several large buildings have received direct hits.At Waldau, several of the main buildings of the Fieseler Aircraft Assemblyplant (F.W. 190) have been damaged, and, in addition, buildings on the factoryairfield have been affected.Lippstadt Airfield. Photographs taken on the 19th April after theTJ.S.A.A.F. attack earlier in the day, show that the main weight fell on the hangarworkshop and barrack area on the southern boundary of the airfield, where one large and one medium-sized hangar, the control tower building and several medium and small workshops and storage sheds, have been damaged. The barracks area has been the worst affected and many buildings have been destroyed or severely damaged. Other damage comprises the compass-swinging base, which has been destroyed, a large hangar in the north dispersal area which has been completelygutted, and three small buildings on the south-west boundary. The railway southof the airfield has received at least eight hits.Oschersleben. Photographs taken on the 19th April after the U.S.A.A.F.attack on the 11th April, show that many of the major units of theAgo Flugzeugwerke G.m.b.H. (Me. 109 assembly), which suffered in the attack onthe 20th February, have again been hit. Four buildings have been completely destroyed, and the main workshop and two assembly shops severely damaged.Several other buildings have been affected in varying degree.Paderborn airfield and air park. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F.attack on the 19th April, show that the main weight has fallen on the buildings in the north-east corner of the airfield and on the landing ground in this area.Four large hangars and six workshop buildings have been severely damaged anda small hangar has been destroyed. In addition store and personnel buildings and buildings in the M.T. yard have received several direct hits. There are64 craters on the landing ground, 17 on taxi tracks and hangar aprons and 13 onthe light railway serving the airfield buildings : several railway wagons havebeen derailed.France.Aulnoye. Photographs show the principal damage caused on the 10th/11th April to be in the south-western two-thirds of the marshalling yards. the carriage and wagon repair shops have been severely damaged and two floatingtop tanks destroyed. There are at least 50 direct hits in the yard itself, causingextensive damage to rolling-stock and impairing permanent way on about two-thirds of the tracks.   A three-track flyover has been severely damaged.Lens. Photographs taken after the attack on the 20th/21st April, are of poor quality, but it can be seen that the locomotive and carriage repair shops havebeen severely damaged, that the approaches to the locomotive repair shops havebeen disrupted, and that the main tracks to Douai have been hit in several places.Paris jJu-may. Photographs show that the attack on the 18th/ 19th Aprilalmost completely devastated the marshalling yards, the concentration of cratersin the area being the greatest yet achieved in attacks on this type of target.Amongst the great destruction caused to rolling-stock, permanent way and electrical equipment, approximately 16 locomotives have been immobilised, and both the Sud-Ouest and Sud-Est main lines have been severed at many points.Paris I La Chapelle. Photographs show that, during the attack on the20th/21st April, severe damage was caused to tracks, installations and rolling-stock in the southern end of the marshalling yard.  The bridge south of the yard
is severely damaged if not severed, and industrial premises nearby, one of whichmanufactures railway components, have been severely damaged.Paris I&apos; Noisy-le-Sec. Photographs show that the main weight of the attackon the 18th/19th April has fallen across the centre of the marshalling yard, withsmaller concentrations on the eastern exits. There is severe roof damage to bothlocomotive round-houses as well as to two repair shops. Three carriage repairshops have also been damaged, the transhipment sheds have been partlydemolished, and there are many hits on the reception and sorting sidings,destroying tracks and rolling-stock and cutting all roads in more than one place where lines diverge.   The passenger station has also been damaged.Rouen/Sotteville. Photographs, taken after the attack on the 18th/ 19thApril, show damage, throughout the marshalling yard, to tracks, rolling stock,buildings and facilities, to be extensive and severe. Amongst seriously damagedbuildings are the Quatre Mares loco, repair works, the wagon repair shops,and the engine shed and workshops, a footbridge over a constriction of lines, anda road bridge over the south end of the yard have also been hit.St. Cyr. Photographs taken on the 19th April, show the attack on thesignals equipment depot to have been highly successful. Five large and important buildings have been two-thirds destroyed and another entirelydemolished; five more buildings have sustained roof damage, one hut has been destroyed, and there are several craters on the adjoining airfield, which, however,is only partly covered by the photographs.Laon.- Photographs taken on the 23rd April, show that, in the attack on the night of 22nd/23rd April, damage is mainly in the area around the sortingsidings where damage has been caused to transhipment sheds, carriage and wagonrepair shops, the goods depot and rolling stock.Belgium.CharleroijSt. Martin: Marshalling Yard. Photographs taken after theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 18th April, show that all tracks in the yard were cut in many places and that no movement was possible. The railway vrorkshops,covering an area of nearly eight acres, have been devastated, one engine round-house has been completely and the other partially destroyed. Approximately75 wagons have been destroyed and 160 damaged.Malines. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken after theAmerican attacks on the 19th and 22nd April, shows that the works in the loco-motive repair shops arsenal have been approximately three-quarters destroyed and every building has been affected-: there is also a heavy concentration of cratersin this area. One of the three sheds of the locomotive shed has been gutted:13 bays of another have been half destroyed, and. the third shed has been damaged.At least 20 wagons have been damaged in the marshalling yard, where thereis another heavy concentration of craters, and seven direct hits have cut the brussels-Louvain tracks.The Erla aircraft works, immediately S.W. of the locomotive arsenal, whichare housed in the former premises of Usines Boxmeyer and S.A. de Waal, andwhich are probably repairing Me. 109 wings, have been severely damaged.Ottignies. Photographic cover obtained after the attack on the20th/21st April, is not very satisfactory, but &quot;it can be seen that about 20wagons in the marshalling yards to the north of the railway station have been destroyed or severely damaged and that nearly all tracks have been damaged.In the north-east extension of the yards, ten more wagons have been destroyed and many tracks damaged. The railway line running north to Brussels has probably been cut in four places.
