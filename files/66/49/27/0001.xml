THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.SECEET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 227.25th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport.1. The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs has asked (W.P. (44) 192)that the Cabinet should consider post-war monetary and economic policy so thatthe United Kingdom Government may be able to give Dominion Prime Ministersan indication of their views.2. I need hardly remind my colleagues that shipping plays a very important part in our economy, and that it is intimately affected by general economic policy. In particular, the volume of international trade is of primaryconcern. If trade between the nations nourishes and expands, our shipping willprosper and our fleet increase. On the other hand, if international tradedwindles, no amount of Government support can long maintain our shipping and shipbuilding industries.3. It is universally admitted that our hopes of post-war prosperity are dependent on a greatly increased volume of exports. In the years immediately before the war the contribution to our invisible exports by British shipping was of the order of 100 million a year. Every effort should be made to increase this figure, and it can only be done if the trade is there to carry.4. Quite apart from the importance of shipping and shipbuilding as a source of foreign exchange and of employment to our people, these industries are a vital factor in our ability to defend ourselves. The maximum volume ofseaborne trade in peace time is, therefore, of the highest strategic importance.Consequently any decision artificially to foster any particular industry at theexpense of shipping would react adversely on our defence potential.5. The interests of this country are in general best served by fosteringinternational trade on the widest and least restricted basis, and I am convincedthat the multilateral approach of the &quot;Washington proposals&quot; is the right course to adopt rather than the alternative of a complex of bilateral (andprobably discriminatory) agreements.6. I have recorded my views with special reference to the very greatimportance of this issue to the future of British shipping, but I do not wish to urge a sectional view. I am sure that the public interest is in this respect thesame as&quot; the interests of the Shipping Industry. It is mainly through an expansion of world trade that we can hope to raise the standard of living ofour people.Ministry of War Transport,25th A pril, 1944. .[27347]
