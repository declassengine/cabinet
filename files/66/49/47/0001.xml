This Ouou...o.rt is ti,ej^Ky jjjs Britannic Majesty&apos;s Government.THE GREEK CRISIS(APRIL  1-25,  1944.)(1)Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador&apos; to the Greek Government, Cairo.(No. 121.   Most Secret.) 1st April, 1944.Your telegram No. 189 [of 30th March : Situation in Greece].The King of Greece discussed the situation with Sir A. Cadogan on29th March.2. The King complained that he was being pressed to include communists in his Government. He was not inclined to do so at present, although he wishedto broaden the basis of the present Government. He complained that his suggestion that six politicians should be brought over from Greece had not been complied with.3. His Majesty then referred to the military agreement, which he admittedhad so far been observed. He hoped it might be extended and strengthened, and thought it would be better not to try and reach a political agreement, therebystirring up political trouble. Above all, he deprecated further discussion of hisown position and of the monarchy.4. The King said he had decided to refuse to sign the Constitutional Actand to stand on his declaration of November last. He was prepared to retainDamaskinos as &quot;his representative,&quot; and in actual fact as a member of theGovernment, though he was against giving any publicity to the appointment.5. Tor your own very confidential information, the King stated that sincetaking his decision to refuse to sign the Act he had received a private letter fromTsouderos advising him to refuse, I am at a total loss to understand Tsouderos&apos;smotive in giving such advice.6. Finally, the King said that the answer which the Prime Minister had given in the House last November (see my telegram No. 250) to a questionconcerning the position of His Majesty had had a most beneficial effect in Greece,and hinted that he would appreciate some further statement of this kind. Inpresent circumstances this appears out of the question.7. The King&apos;s attitude is, you will agree, extremely unsatisfactory andunhelpful. I do not, however, feel in a position to take any further action inthe matter until you are able to report the exact terms of the King&apos;s reply toM. Tsouderos and the latter&apos;s reaction.8. What is the position as regards the politicians who are to come out from greece ? Do I understand from paragraph 3 of your telegram under referencethat they are already on the way ?(2)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 198.  Most Secret.) 3rd April, 1944.Your telegram No. 121.I feel I nmst express myself with some bluntness. The King of Greece isplaying with fire. He is endangering not only the interests of the monarchy but those of his country by not realising in time the rapid trend of events.12334   [27363] ^ b
2. Let me briefly sum up what has been happening here politically duringthe last forty-eight hours. For details of what has occurred in Greek armed forces here, see my telegram No. 202.3. E.A.M. have realised the danger to them of a united front betweenpoliticians in Athens and the Greek Government in Cairo. They have realised that the outcome of an agreement would be the reinforcement of the Governmenthere and the end of their experiment to set up a separate Government in the mountains. They have therefore used the interval in order to strike at theGreek Government by subverting the Greek forces. Their agitation has had some success, and within the next few days it may have more.4. M. Tsouderos at this juncture finds, himself in a dilemma. He had secured a good basis of collaboration with his colleagues as a result of messagesof support from the archbishop and politicians in Athens, but this agreement was based on his success in inducing the King to sign Constitutional Actappointing the archbishop as Regent. Some weeks have now passed duringwhich time M. Tsouderos has received no final reply from the King, merely a preliminary view from him of a negative character. This he concealed from hiscolleagues in order to avoid an explosion, but they suspected him of concealingit, and in any case they are incensed that they should be kept waiting so longfor the King&apos;s reply. This situation could have been held but for recentE.A.M. agitation in the army. M. Tsouderos&apos;s colleagues now feel themselveshandicapped in dealing with the extreme Left and wish to make M. Tsouderosthe scapegoat, and so the foolish suggestion has been put to him that he should give way to his very weak [ ? group omitted] M. Veniselos, who is incapable ofriding any storm. (There is also a school of thought in the army which wishes to make Karapanaghiotis the scapegoat like M. Canellopoulos last year.)5. M. Tsouderos explained this to me at some length this morning, when I found him for the first time in a state of real agitation. He explained that theKing&apos;s delay was not only destroying unity here but also amongst politicians inAthens to whom he had been able to send no satisfactory reply. He feared the worst if the King continued in his present course. In reply to my enquiry he told me he had kept the King fully informed, and that the latter could not be under any serious misapprehension. The only explanation was that he had someother policy in mind. He feared in fact that the King might be contemplatinghis replacement by the Royalist politician M. Mavromichalis, a man of straw.Such a step would take the lid off the present smouldering volcano, and we shouldhave chaos here in Greek affairs.6. I exacted a promise from M. Tsouderos that he would to-day telegraphthe King in very blunt language, and I promised him that I would telegraph toyou in similar terms.(3)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 199.) 3rd April, 1944.My telegram No. 198.M. Tsouderos has just informed me that he is telegraphing his resignationto the King of Greece to-day and is recommending M. Veniselos as his successor.2.   My immediately following telegram contains my comments.(4)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 200.   Secret.) 3rd April, 1944.My immediately preceding telegram.I have for some time past suspected that M. Veniselos was up to someintrigue though my evidence was too indefinite to report. For example,Group Captain Vilos, who was sent to Athens on a purely service mission, was reported to have been given a secret political mission by M. Veniselos, though thelatter denied the truth of this report both to M. Tsouderos and to his Government.A further suspicious circumstance was the arrival here of M. Vassiliadis (see my telegram No. Ill), who has been hand in glove with M. Veniselos since hearrived.   I suspect now that M. Sophoulis, the head of the Liberal party, which
M. Veniselos belongs, was privy to this conspiracy, feeling that, if he could removehis most formidable rival, M. Tsouderos, it would be easy to take over from hisyoung lieutenant, M. Veniselos, when Athens was liberated.2. These, of course, would probably have come to nothing had E.A.M. notprepared the way by their subversive propaganda among the armed forces. This,coupled with the silence of the King, gave M. Veniselos his opportunity. two days ago he encouraged his henchman, M. Vassiliadis, to propose to M. Tsouderosthat he should resign in favour of M. Veniselos. M. Tsouderos did not respond.Meanwhile, the situation became more tense. M. Veniselos prepared a foolishbroadcast in which he cast himself for the role of mediator between ColonelBakirdzis and the Greek Government. M. Tsouderos cut out this part of the broadcast but passed the rest. It is now clear that this broadcast was apreparation for this morning&apos;s coup. Shortly after I had left M. Tsouderos earlythis morning, the latter was invited by MM. Veniselos, Karapanayiotis andVoulgaris to a meeting at which they requested his resignation in favour ofM. Veniselos. M. Tsouderos, feeling himself unsupported by the King and unabletherefore to satisfy his colleagues and deal with the restlessness in the army witha united Cabinet behind him, immediately accepted the suggestion made to himby his colleagues.3. It is too soon to judge the consequences of all this. The King mayrefuse to accept M. Veniselos, in which case there will almost certainly be troublehere. Nobody, save M. Tsouderos, could have held the position together duringthe last few months, and I fail to see anybody else here who can. The King, byrejecting the advice given him by his Prime Minister last November when thelatter went all out in favour of His Majesty&apos;s Governments recommendation tothe King, and by again rejecting the advice conveyed by the whole of the GreekGovernment, has placed M. Tsouderos in an impossible position. He had, in fact,no room in which to manoeuvre, as the King would not give him the cards he required.4. In M. Tsouderos the King has lost the one man who might have securedhis return to Greece. I doubt whether he will find anybody else here who is eitherwilling or competent to do so. It is the King and not M. Tsouderos who will lose,as the latter will now be free to adopt an independent line and may emerge later in a more powerful position.5. Greek crises usually require a scapegoat. Last year it wasM. Kanellopoulos; this time M. Tsouderos has accepted the role for himself. Itmay be that for the present, if the King accepts Veniselos, the trouble in thearmy will dilappear, but any co-operation between the King and M. Veniseloswill be virtually impossible. I suggest, if the King asks you for advice in this new crisis, you should recommend him to telegraph at once his full agreement to signing constitutional act of his acceptance of M. Veniselos ad interim pendinghis own return to Cairo, when the whole situation can be examined on the spot.(5)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 202.) 4th April., 1944.My telegram No. 198, paragraph 2.Agitation of E.A.M. elements referred to in paragraph 2 of my telegramNo. 189 has unfortunately caused some trouble in the Greek armed forces, the mostserious of which is in the Second Field Regiment of which a number of officersand over 200 men declared in favour of Political Committee and have been removed from their regiment without resistance to a separate camp., two small units have done the same and there has been some trouble among elements in Cairo.2. The Ninth Army and Air Force agitators who handed the Presidentof the Council a memorandum calling on the Greek Government &apos;&apos; to make their contribution to the unification of the national forces and the formation of aGovernment based on Political Committee of National Liberation&quot; started the trouble on 31st March. Their immediate arrest was decided upon by the GreekGovernment but they were subsequently released owing to defection of theirguards.[27363] &quot; b 2
3. There is fortunately no trouble in the First Brigade and certain otherunits which are aware that they are to proceed to Italy.4. The only cure for the trouble is action in the field and I hope that thepresent incidents will not compromise the chances of other units, besides the FirstBrigade, leaving for Italy.5. After consultation with me General Headquarters are taking steps to arrest a number of ringleaders on grounds of military security.(6)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 203.) 4th April, 1944.My telegram No. 197.A message has been received stating that M. Sophoulis is satisfied with the cairo Government as it is and does not propose to come out himself or send a representative, but that M. Papandreou and Popular party both acceptTsouderos&apos;s proposal. Since knowledge of discussions in Athens has becomewidely known, the Germans have ordered the arrest of Papandreou but he has succeeded in hiding. We are informed by C.I. whose representative is in close contact with Papandreou that they think they can arrange to bring him out.I have asked them to do so as soon as possible.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.Your telegram No. 121, paragraph 5.I am quite sure Tsouderos sent no such letter.  King must be misconstruingcompletely something else which the President of the Council had written to him.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 207.   Secret.) 4th April, 1944.My telegram No. 202.MM. Veniselos and Karapanayiotis came to see me this morning. To avoidmisunderstanding I informed Veniselos that I was not seeing him as Presidentof the Council as Tsouderos remained in office pending the King&apos;s decision. Thiswas agreed.2. The two Ministers said that they had come to tell me that disordersin certain army units and in Cairo were due entirely to Communists. they themselves would have been quite prepared to use force to restore order, but asthey were in a foreign country they had to appeal to the British Militaryauthorities to do so for them.3. I said that I had been in consultation with the latter and had authorisedthem to make such arrests as military security required. I would be glad to knowwhether this had the full approval of the Greek Ministers. They signified their agreement. Turning to Karapanayiotis I made it clear that this would meangeneral clean up of the agitators against whom I considered that he as Ministerof War should have taken action in the past. He looked sheepish and didnot reply.4. In conclusion I informed them that we intended to do everything in our power to safeguard the Greek Brigade from contamination before they left for italy.  Morale there was very good and I hoped any agitators would receive the(7)(No. 205.  Most Secret.)4th April, 1944.(8)
welcome they deserved. I enjoined on them the need for keeping calm while weacted as we thought fit and I told them I would pass no communication from themto Colonel Bakirdzis in Greece until order here had been fully restored. Anyweakness towards Bakirdzis at this moment would be intolerable, as I suspectedhe had had a hand in these disorders which had caused our own authorities somuch embarrassment.  This also was agreed.f (9)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 208.   Secret.) 4th April, 1944.My immediately preceding telegram.H.R.H. Crown Prince sent for me to-day to learn latest developments. he expressed full agreement with steps we were taking. He told me he had telegraphed through open channel yesterday urging the King to return withoutdelay and asked me if I agreed. I replied that the new situation clearly demandedhis presence as soon as possible, but I thought it also demanded cognisance of his announcement of appointment of M. Veniselos as President of the Councilad interim. Rather to my surprise he said he thought this was right, and asked if I would transmit a telegram to His Majesty from him giving similar [groupundecypher able ].2. My immediately following telegram contains text of message from HisRoyal Highness.3. He told me he had been urged by some people to visit Greek Brigadeat once, but was doubtful whether this would be wise. I advised him to leavewell alone at the moment.   He agreed with evident relief.(10)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 209.   Secret.) 4th April, 1944.My immediately preceding telegram.Following is text of message from His Royal Highness the Crown Prince toHis Majesty King of Greece : &quot; In my opinion the necessity of your return most urgent.   Suggest youappoint interim Prime Minister pending your arrival.&quot;(11)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 211.   Secret.) 5th April, 1944.My telegram No. 209.General Kallergis, former Director-General of the Army, and one of theprincipal trouble makers, was arrested last night. To-day the office of the GreekProvost-Marshal in Cairo, which had been occupied by 300 rebels, had to besurrounded by British troops and Egyptian police in order to compel evacuation.Show of force had immediately the desired effect, and personnel were removedwithout trouble in lorries to isolation camp.2. The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior have in consequence of theseincidents requested Lord Killearn to arrange [group omitted : % with] british military authorities for the removal of all Greek troops in the suburbs of Cairoto some place where they can be properly controlled by British forces should theyattempt any further breach of public security.
3. Colonel Bourdaras, former Chief of Staff, and an energetic and patrioticofficer, has been appointed to Provost-Marshal with the task of rounding up theremaining ringleader still at large.4. Similar action is being taken at Alexandria, where Merchant Marineseaman agitator Karayiannis has barricaded himself in house with thirtysupporters and is defying the police.(12)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office,(No. 212.   Secret.) 5th April, 1944.M. Tsouderos has just informed me that five ships of the Royal HellenicNavy in Alexandria have declared in favour of a republic, and have demandedthe resignation of every member of the present Government. They couple this demand with a request to M. Tsouderos to hand over to M. Roussos in order thathe may head a republican committee to negotiate with Colonel Bakirdzis forformation of a Coalition Government. M. Roussos has arrived in Cairo from alexandria in order to receive M. Tsouderos&apos;s capitulation. The latter hasrefused to see him. M. &quot;Veniselos has handed in his resignation to M. Tsouderosas Minister of Marine.2. I have sent urgent message to Admiral Rawlings in Alexandria asking for confirmation.3. M. Tsouderos would be grateful if you will inform the King of theHellenes.(13)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 213.) 5th April, 1944.President of the Council has just informed me that all members of theGovernment have now tendered their resignations but would remain in officead interim pending acceptance by the King.(14)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 214.   Secret.) 5th April, 1944.My telegram No. 212.Account seems to be inaccurate and much exaggerated.2. Admiral Alexandris denies the story regarding Roussos but says thatthe situation is very difficult and some action must be taken to avert disaster.3. Admiral Rawlings and Admiral Alexandris are arriving here early this afternoon. I am seeing Admiral Alexandris as soon as he arrives at Tsouderos&apos;surgent request in order to persuade him to allow Tsouderos to put his name tothe King as head of a purely service Government.4. Meanwhile, the new Greek Provost Marshal (see paragraph 3 of my telegram No. 211) and the British authorities are continuing the clean up. Nofurther incidents have been reported. The situation in the Cairo area appearsto be well in hand.5. I will telegraph later in the day after the meeting I am attending withthe Commander-in-chief.
Prime Minister to General Wilson, repeated to General Alexander.(Special Unnumbered.   Top Secret.) 5th April, 1944.It is now more than three months since we agreed that a Greek Brigadeif necessary without its vehicular equipment should be sent from Egypt to italy to take part in the Allied offensive. I am told that one company has already gotthere and that the others will be got there during the month. Why is thereall this delay and difficulty in moving this handful of men 1 They are very liablein Egypt to be contaminated by revolutionary and Communist elements inEgypt. Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to do. Now do pleasetry to get them shipped off out of Egypt as soon as possible and assembled insome suitable town in Southern Italy. I feel this small matter which has largepolitical significance ought not to have hung fire so long.(T.O.O. 052220Z)(16)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 215.  Secret.) Qth April, 1944.My immediately preceding telegram.The proposal to recommend to the King that Admiral Alexandris should form a purely service Government was abandoned before the Admiral arrivedthis afternoon in Cairo. I therefore confined my talk with him to the actualstate of affairs in the Greek Navy. (Please see my immediately following telegram.)2. At lunch to-day M. Tsouderos told me that after many consultations with his colleagues and with senior officers it had been agreed that the king should again be pressed to nominate M. Veniselos as President of the Council.M. Tsouderos is telegraphing the King to-day warning him that there is noother way of holding things together.3. Yesterday the King requested M. Tsouderos to remain in office whileM. Veniselos came to London to report to him on the situation. NeitherM. Veniselos nor any other member of the Government has agreed to this solution.   It would be dangerous for the King to return to it.4. M. Tsouderos explained to me this morning that the real cause of the unrest in the army and in the navy was the determination of both services that,the King should not return to Greece before a plebiscite. This feeling has beenskilfully exploited by E.A.M. for their own purposes but they could not havehad any success if the question of the King had already been settled. The present crisis, therefore, was essentially Republican and not Communist in spite ofcertain Communist manifests. This was clearer in the navy than in the army,but applied to both services.  The position is the same in the air force.5. In these circumstances it was useless for M. Tsouderos himself tocontinue even temporarily in office owing to his long and close association withthe King. He had come to this conclusion with reluctance but with a firmconviction that his departure now was in the general interest. He had hoped to steer the King through to the end of the war without an upheaval, but during recent months the King had at [sic : % on] several occasions rejected his advice and gone his own way with disastrous consequences.6. What he feared most at the present moment was that the King would again reject his advice and refuse to appoint M. Veniselos at once. Either a refusal or delay on the King&apos;s part might create chaos in Greek affairs here. Hebegged that His Majesty&apos;s Government would [group undecypherable:? specially] give the utmost help. There were two things which he feared theKing might do in a mood of indignation. He might either abdicate or make anarbitnary appointment. In either case the consequences would be a majorcalamity at this moment.   It would play straight into&apos;the hands of E.A.M.7. His best hope was that M. Veniselos should carry on until suitableleaders arrived from Athens in order to form a representative Government. Thatwas the hope of all his colleagues but while they waited the King must enable theposition here to be held in the way indicated above.  In particular M. Tsouderos
emphasised that the King must not return to Cairo at this juncture owing to thelatest developments.8. When Greek affairs get into a tangle [group undecypherable : ? it is]difficult not only to decide between fact and fiction but to know whether any onefact at the moment will not be out of date a few hours later. Rumour has beenbuzzing between Cairo and Alexandria and the wildest stories have gainedcurrency. I have done my best to give you an accurate account of a rapidlvchanging position.(17)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 216.  Secret.) Qth April, 1944.My telegram No. 215.Admiral Alexandris gave me the following account in the presence of AdmiralRawlings. He said nothing disturbing had happened in the fleet, but strong feeling was running amongst the lower decks on the subject of lack of co-operationbetween Cairo Government and guerrillas in Greece. This feeling had been carefully fostered during the preceding months by such subversive organisationsas E.A.S. Communists. These same agencies had tried several times during the summer of 1943 to create disturbances but these had been stopped. This timeagitation was widespread and he was sure that 99 per cent, of the crews atpresent in Alexandria were affected. As all the Greek ships called in periodicallyat Alexandria and had had their crews worked on by these organisations, he was satisfied the same applied to those at [group undecypherable:   ? sea].2. The slogan of f&apos; co-operative guerrillas &quot; had been particularly effectiveowing to the measure of recognition accorded to Tito&apos;s administration. Thelast straw had been the announcement of the formation of Colonel Bakirdzis&apos;scommittee. It was not a question of personalities, and he was sure that the menwere in such a state that they would accept any committee set up in Greece. Theidea had been spread that M. Tsouderos was opposed to the policy of co-operationwith the guerrillas. The long delay in reaching an agreement since the visit of the six Greeks in August 1942 had been exploited in support of this allegation.I pointed out that M. Tsouderos had been handicapped by the impossibility, for security reasons, of giving publicity to the negotiations he had been conductingfor co-operation with all parties and organisations in Greece and Tsouderos&apos;sdifficulty of carrying the King with him. Admiral Alexandris agreed that itwas a very unfair situation and that M. Tsouderos was much the most able of thepoliticians.3. Admiral Alexandris first heard of the trouble in the navy on 3rd april and summoned the captains of the ships to report. All said that the majorityof the crews expressed a wish that co-operation between the Government andguerrillas should be effected as quickly as possible; the extremer elements were opposed to any limit of [group undecypherable] Greece. He thought the extremeelements might find their opportunity if uncertainty continues. For psychologicalreasons a change of Government was inevitable and practically all favoured theappointment of M. Veniselos as President of the Council although extremistswere against him. I thought this change would keep the people quiet. I regardedM. Roussos as largely responsible for the agitation and considered he should bebrought into the new Government and made to share responsibility of thesituation he had helped to create. i4. In answer to my question Admiral Alexandris denied the truth of thereport (see my telegram No. 212) that the navy had demanded a republic andresignation of the whole Government in favour of a committee under M. Roussosor of [group undecypherable Is (see paragraph 4 of my telegram No. 211).Admiral Alexandris considered he should have been arrested last year. I thought the measures taken now in operation might lead to trouble but could not be suspended as it would be a sign of weakness. It was, however, desirable that anearly statement should be made on the subject of the arrests (arrangements arebeing made to inform the Greek forces through service channels of the positionand of the reasons for action taken).

Tsouderos the following message from me : I was much shocked to hear of your resignation, which seems to leave Greece^orlorn at a moment of peril for its national life. The King, whom I have justseen, tells me he has not accepted your resignation. He is coming out to alexandria next week.   Surely you can await his arrival.2. I have also asked General Wilson to expedite to the utmost possibledegree the movement of the Greek Brigade into Italy.3. I understand the Greek navy is placed under the General Command ofthe British. Commander-in-Chief in the Levant. I have asked the Admiralty totell him that he is responsible for making sure that no disturbances are causedfor political purposes, and that there can be no question of politicalpronouncements made by the sailors.4.

M. Veniselos in his place. Yesterday he had asked M. Tsouderos to remain in office and M. Veniselos to come and see him in London. He had now telegraphedcancelling these two proposals, and in their place he was going to acceptM. Tsouderos&apos;s resignation and appoint M. Veniselos as Prime Minister in his place.  A communique had indeed been issued to this effect at noon to-day.2. M. Aghnides asked that you should be told of this change, and hopedthat you would give M. Veniselos all possible encouragement, since there werereports that he was now hesitating to accept the premiership.3. I also informed M. Aghnides that the Secretary of State and thePrime Minister both felt that it was highly desirable that the King should returnto Cairo as soon as possible in order to take control of the political crisis. I will inform you as soon as we know when the King proposes to leave.(22)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 218.  Most Secret.) Qth April, 1944.Southern Department^ letter R3105/9/G of 6th March.In conversation with member of my staff on 4th April the Soviet Counsellorspoke in favour of E.A.M.-E.L.A.S., and said that Zervas had wrongly provokedcivil war and had prevented agreement at recent negotiations on the question ofa united command and the appointment of a Political Committee, As E.L.A.S.was by far the larger body, he considered that it was up to Zervas to fit in withits requirements. Zervas had not fought the Germans at all, all the fighting was done by E.L.A.S. Zervas was compromised with the Germans by the activitiesof E.D.E.S. in Athens.2. The Soviet Counsellor said that M. Tsouderos was &apos;&apos; not so bad asPuritch,&quot; but he should long ago have come to an agreement with political forcesinside Greece. He had failed to agree with the six delegates of the resistanceorganisations who came to Egypt last summer, and he was delaying consequentrelations with the Political Committee. The Soviet Counsellor seemed to thinkthat the Political Committee was at least of equal importance with the CairoGovernment.3. All these arguments are purely local E.A.M. propaganda which theSoviet Counsellor appears willingly to have swallowed whole.4. I report the foregoing as it is perhaps not altogether irrelevant to thepresent difficulties.(23)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 219.) Qth April, 1944.My telegram No. 215.I read my telegram under reference to Commanders-in-chief at their meeting this afternoon at which the Minister-Resident was also present.

We should consequently be grateful for any assistance which can be givenin inducing the King of the Hellenes to accept without delay the appointmentM.

Throughout his conversation Admiral Alexandris was careful not totouch on the constitutional issue, and I refrained from questioning him as hewas obviously anxious to keep himself clear of politics. If he could have spokenfreely I have no doubt that the admiral&apos;s account would have approximated more closely to that of Tsouderos.(25)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 222.   Secret.) 7th April, 1944.Trouble unfortunately spread early this morning to First Brigade wheresoldiers&apos; committees have taken over control. Commander-in-chief is advisingA.F. Headquarters that brigade is now unfit for service and cannot be sent toItaly.2. Position in navy has also deteriorated. Crew of the destroyer Pindusare reported to have thrown their commander and another officer overboard.(26)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 223.  Secret.) . . 7th April, 1944.My immediately preceding telegram.What is happening here among the Greeks is nothing less than a revolution.2. It is under such conditions that a makeshift Greek Government in exile,suffering from all the weaknesses which that implies, has been trying to cope with the situation. It has failed completely but has been handicapped by being able to make no legal change without the sanction of the King at a distance.When the King refused the first advice given by M. Tsouderos to appointM. Veniselos, the situation inside the Government became chaotic. M. Tsouderosrealised from the outset that every day he remained without appointment of a successor the position would deteriorate. Deserted by. his colleagues when thestorm broke, he had no authority over the armed forces who regard him as the instrument of the King. An immediate change was essential for a Governmentto recover any authority.3. Delay in obtaining any successor to M. Tsouderos explains the farcicalproceedings of the last three days. First M. Veniselos was recommended to theKing. The answer was a request for M. &apos; Veniselos to come to London.Immediately the Government returned to the King with the demand thatM. Veniselos should be appointed, and, in order to stop wild rumours circulatinghere among the Greeks, announced the fact to the press. Before the King hadbeen given time to reply to this renewed request, the situation in the army and navy had further deteriorated and M. Veniselos gave an independent statement to the press that he could no longer accept office even if the King offered it to him.4. This morning under the shadow of further trouble in the navy andoutbreak in the Greek brigades, the Cabinet met again. A candidate furtherLeft had to be found and M. Roussos was pressed by the whole Cabinet to accept.His name was immediately telegraphed to the King. This fact was also givento the press at once by the Greek Government.
5. This choice will be even more distasteful to the King than that ofM. Veniselos. In previous telegrams I have expressed my views on the character and conduct of M. Roussos when he was in office. He is old, infirm and untrust-worthy according to any reasonable standards, but he is more acceptable to the left than any member of the present Government and for that reason he hasbeen asked to assume temporary responsibility as the last hope of preventing thenavy from going the same way as the army and saving that much, at any nate,from the wreckage.6. I find it hard to believe that the King will accept M. Roussos unless heis by this time convinced that there is no alternative and that the suggestion thatM. Tsouderos should continue in office is unworkable. The latter has asked meto warn you that if the King refuses to accept M. Roussos or delays his reply,there is strong chance that M. Roussos with wide backing will set up a RepublicanCommittee. The army, which by its supreme folly has now ruled itself out ofthe war effort, would readily go Republican but, what is much more serious,the navy would probably follow suit.7. I wish to add that during the whole of this crisis which has been latentfor weeks past I am satisfied that M. Tsouderos has been wholly guided by theinterests of his country. During the last few days he has behaved with a dignity and directness which is unusual in Greek political life. I hope the press will be guided accordingly.  A recent Times article was most unfair.(27)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 224.  Secret.) 7th April, 1944.My telegram No. 215, paragraph 7.I understand that British Security authorities here have telegraphed toM.I. 5 saying they cannot accept responsibility for the King&apos;s personal safety ifhe returns to Egypt in the present circumstances.(28)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 226.  Most Secret.) 7th April, 1944.Your telegram No. 124.Following is text of M. Tsouderos&apos;s reply to the Prime Minister : *&apos;&apos; I thank you warmly for the friendly message which you haveaddressed to me to-day. Never for an instant could I have thought to leaveGreece forlorn at.a difficult moment. My [group undecypherable: % attitude]during the last few days has been dictated by the interests of my countryand those of the Allies to which I am devoted. When these disturbancesbegan the majority of my colleagues asked for my resignation because they said that this would restore calm in the armed force. If I had not thensubmitted my resignation, the state of affairs which has since developed inGreek armed forces would have been ascribed to my ambition to retain power.I should have been blamed for this by my colleagues and by the Greek people,and a topic would have been given for enemy propaganda to use to the Greekpublic. The present uprising in a section of the armed forces and theformation of Bakirdzis Committee have an anti-Royal character and are theresult of a Communist plot. The feeling of dislike for myself is only due toconviction that I am loyal to the King and that I have delayed coming toan understanding with E.A.M. You know that I am not responsible forthis delay. For the real condition of affairs in our country I would referyour Excellency to my letter of 7th March. I think it is due to misfortuneof distance that I have not explained them sufficiently, and that His majesty the King has not been able to accept the suggestions which I urgentlysubmitted to him on grounds of crisis in the Government and negotiations with were being undertaken with persons in Greece, I was convinced thatthese suggestions were sound by my knowledge of the situation here and bya correct appreciation of affairs in Greece. On this latter point I had beenfully informed a month ago by Archbishop of Athens, whose sound proposals
will be known to you. -I shall remain at my post as the laws of - Greecerequire and as you desire until this present crisis has found lawful solution,and you may rest assured that I will not recognise any arrangement whichlacks lawful sanction. If the King waits until he returns to Egypt before he resolves this crisis, I fear that by that time there may be no longer any opportunity of resolving it. I have sent a telegram to him to-dayrecommending that he should come to an immediate decision in London forthe solution of the crisis.&quot;(29)     - his Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 227.  Most Secret.) 7th April, 1944.Following for Sir Orme Sargent: &apos;King of Greece&apos;s return here at present would certainly provoke freshtrouble. Tsouderos and all his colleagues are strongly of this opinion. Hewould find himself isolated and unable to do anything and would be a graveembarrassment to us.2. Crown Prince consulted me last night. He is now most anxious thathis brother should not return at present on the ground that he could do nothing.Please do everything in your power to stop his return. In the circumstances inwhich we are living here at the moment, advice of people on the spot should, i submit, be accepted.  My views are shared by everybody here.(30)Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo.(No. 131.) 7th April, 1944.Following from Prime Minister : Your telegrams Nos. 222, 223, 224, 226 and 227.I have discussed situation with the King. He is resolved to return to Cairo,leaving by air Sunday evening, and notwithstanding your telegram No. 227 (whichI have shown the King) I consider he is right to do so. If, as you say, whatis happening in Cairo is a Greek revolution, I cannot advise him to stay away and allow the issue to be decided in his absence.2. I recognise that Tsouderos has lost control of his Cabinet and of thesituation generally, but it is essential, pending the King&apos;s return, that thesituation should be held and that a stop should be put to this disorderly search for a new Prime Minister. Clearly M. Tsouderos and his Government must remain technically in office until the King arrives and can take a decision on the spot. In order to steady the position I suggest that you, supported by GeneralPaget and by Admiral Rawlings, should at once interview Tsouderos and theGreek Government and inform them with my authority that I count upon themto put a stop to the present discussions and intrigues and to hold the presentposition until the King&apos;s arrival.3. All local Greek politicians and agitators should at the same time be warned that we shall not hesitate to take adequate measures of security to preventagitation and demonstrations which might threaten law and order in Egypt andthe position and authority of the King and the Greek Government. On theKing&apos;s arrivalyou will do all you can to assist the King to re-establish his authority and to form a new lawful Government which will be able to control the situation for the time being. The military authorities are being asked togive you all possible assistance for this purpose.4. You should inform M. Tsouderos in reply to his message to me trans-mitted in your telegram No. 226 that I count on him to remain at his post untilthe present crisis has found a lawful solution, and that the King and I are agreedthat this lawful solution cannot be found until the King has arrived in cairo and reviewed the situation on the spot.5. For your own information the King contemplates the possibility, if allelse fails, of forming a Government of officials to carry on until such time aspoliticians can be brought out of Greece.   He is resolved not to transfer the
Premiership to M. Roussos, since he considers that this would be tantamount toa capitulation to E.A.M. and its political committee in Greece.6. As regards your telegram No. 224, I am informing M.I. 5 that the Britishsecurity authorities in Cairo are responsible for the King&apos;s personal safety, andthat they must take whatever special measures may be necessary in order toensure this.7. This is an occasion for you to show those qualities of imperturbabilityand command which are associated with the British Diplomatic Service.(31)Prime Minister to General Paget, repeated to General Wilson andGeneral Alexander.(Special Unnumbered.   Personal and Top Secret.) 7th April, 1944.I bear you have advised A.F.H.Q. that the Greek Brigade is unfit for service as a result of recent disorders and should not therefore be sent to Italy.2. I said in my telegram to General Wilson of 5th April that the Brigadeshould be shipped to Italy at the earliest possible moment. It is now all themore important that this should be done without delay. Mutinies amongforeign troops under your command cannot be tolerated and General Wilsonis being asked to provide a place where these Greek troops can be brought to afull realisation of their duty. On their voyage by sea measures must be takento prevent mutinous action. Probably the protecting destroyers could providethe necessary authority.3. Please see to it therefore that the Greek troops are sent off as soon aspossible. Don&apos;t hesitate to arrest ringleaders. Of course it is better to avoidbloodshed if possible.4. You should see the telegrom I am sending to Mr. Leeper to-day inwhich I suggest that in order to steady the position, he, supported by you andby Admiral Rawlings, should at once see Tsouderos and the Greek Governmentand inform them in my name that I count upon them to put a stop to the present discussions and intrigues and to hold the present position until the King&apos;arrival. I am also instructing Mr. Leeper to do all he can to assist the king to re-establish his authority and to form a new lawful Government which willbe able to control the situation for the time being. You should give him allpossible assistance for this purpose.(T.O.O. 072150Z)(32)His majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 228.) 7th April, 1944.Please pass the following message to the King of Greece fromM. Tsouderos : &apos;&quot; In view of Reuter&apos;s report that your Majesty hopes M. Veniselos willre-examine his decision after receiving telegram of yesterday&apos;s dateentrusting to him the Presidency of the Council&quot;, M. Veniselos came to seems this afternoon and requested me to inform your Majesty that if Reuter&apos;sreport reflects your wish, he will accept. But he is not prepared to accept this new office with members of the former Cabinet and he requests authority from your Majesty to form a new and small Council of Ministers, probablycomposed of five members, which would to-morrow take the oath before HisRoyal Highness the Diadoch, representing your Majesty.&quot;As I understand the position, the Ministry of M. Veniselos would be composed of : &quot; M. Roussos : Vice-President.&quot; M. Politis : Minister for Foreign Affairs.&quot; M. Mouratiadis : Minister of Finance.&quot; M. Scoufopoulos : Minister of Merchant Marine.&quot; M. Veniselos would keep the three Service Ministries.&quot; This telegram cancels telegram which I sent this morning.   I shouldbe grateful if your Majesty would reply very urgently by the same channel.&quot;
(33)General Wilson to Prime Minister, repeated to C.I.G.S.(Special Unnumbered.   Top Secret and Personal.) 7th April, 1944.Your telegram already received T.O.O. 052220.1. The delay in moving Greek brigade from Middle East to Italy has been due solely to transportation difficulties. The amount of shipping available is limited and up to now has been fully employed in move of other troops fromMiddle East which were more urgently required as reinforcements for the battlein Italy.2. (a) Since January 1944 the following have been moved from Egypt toItaly : 4 British division, Polish corps troops, 5 Polish Kresowa division.(b) The following further moves from Middle East to Italy are now beingcarried out: 10 Indian division, 2 Polish Armoured brigade group, 6 SouthAfrican armoured division.(c) All above formations are of higher fighting value than the Greeks andhave been urgently required by General Alexander for his operations. I have,therefore, given the move of these formations priority over that of Greek brigade.. 3. Possibility of getting Greeks to Italy more quickly has been constantlyunder review here. I put forward to Middle East a project for Greeks to moveby road to Tobruk carrying out a training programme on the way. This wouldhave fitted in well with Plan &apos;: Zeppelin.&quot; Unfortunately, this project had to be abandoned as it was not possible to ship the brigade&apos;s vehicles from Tobruk. .4. Present arrangements are that Greek brigade will embark on XIF 13,which is due to sail from Egypt on 18th April. Latest information from general headquarters, Middle East, indicates that they do not consider brigade fit tomove to Italy as result effect of recent disturbances among Greeek forces in Egypt.In view of instructions contained in your telegram, I am pointing out toGeneral Paget the political importance of this move, and am instructing him thatbrigade should embark unless their state of discipline is such as to make thisimpossible.5. I realise the political need for getting these Greeks away fromundesirable political influence in Egypt: and I regret the delay in carrying outyour wishes in this matter. The delay has only been due to the giving of priority to operational needs of Allied Armies in Italy.r (T.O.O. 071115Z)(34)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 229.) 7th April, 1944.My immediately preceding telegram.I hope you will be able to obtain very early reply from the King and telegraphit to me most immediately, clear the line, if possible en clair, in order that political crisis may be solved to-night.(35)Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo.(No. 134.   Personal, Private and Secret.) 8th April, 1944.From Prime Minister : Your telegrams Nos. 228 and 229 [of 7th April].You will have received my No. 131 [of 7th April] and. you will also be aware of my various telegrams to the military commanders. Weather permitting, theKing will leave Sunday night. Meanwhile, it is M. Tsouderos&apos;s duty to stand to his post. Of course, if he can get M. Sophocles Veniselos to stay with him, allthe better. When the King arrives, the British Security Service must ensurehis personal safety. He may require a few days to make up his mind and muston no account be hustled. I am asking the military commanders to move theGreek brigade as fast as possible to Italy. They will, of course, weed outrecalcitrant elements.  In the same way the Admiral is expected to preserve the
discipline of all ships under his command, using no more force than is necessary.For you yourself, there is a great opportunity. You should stick to the line i have marked out and not be worried about the consequences. You speak ofliving on the lid of a volcano. Wherever else do you expect to live in times likethese? Please, however, be careful to follow very exactly the instructions youare receiving from me, namely, first in priority, order and discipline to be main-tained in the armed forces; secondly, the safety of the King&apos;s person to be ensured; thirdly, every effort to be made to induce Tsouderos to hold office till the King returns and has had time to look around; fourthly, try to get Veniselosto remain with Tsouderos; fifthly, celebrate Easter Sunday in a manner piousand becoming.(36)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 232.) 7 th April, 1944.My telegram No. 222.Commander-in-chief, Middle East, has decided, owing to the present stateof indiscipline in the Greek army, which prejudices military security in theMiddle East Command for which he is responsible, to assume direct controlhimself. He is therefore informing M. Karapanayiotis that henceforth he will deal direct with Colonel Bonssis as his chief staff officer for matters affectingthe Greek army.2. The Commander-in-chief consulted me before taking this action. Iapproved, and promised to deal with any protests the Greek government might make.3. M. Veniselos, if entrusted by the King of Greece with new Governmenton lines of my telegram No. 228, may feel himself affronted and be difficult, butI hope to manage him successfully.(37)Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, to Chiefs of Staff, repeated to A.F.H.Q.,Algiers.(CCL/392.   Top Secret.) 8th April, 1944.1. Situation Greek Naval Forces, Middle East, deteriorating and gives cause for anxiety. The first Greek Destroyer has now refused to obey operational orderto proceed to sea and will probably resist coercion by force. Committee in controlstate will only obey British orders on certain conditions, which include incorpora-tion of E.AM. in Government and release of all prisoners. Subversive elementscontrolled by central committee, Cairo, at present unlocated, have gained control by fear of all naval ships and establishments. All possible steps are being taken tocontrol situation in Alexandria, and one 6-inch cruiser and one fleet destroyerhave been ordered to proceed there with utmost despatch.2. Report from mutinous Greek Brigade states that soldiers have taken updefensive positions round their camp and show no signs of coming to heel.Brigade commander ordered to disarm brigade, but this order not yet carried out;arrangements in hand for disarming of brigade by force, if necessary, and subsequent isolation of personnel at El Daba. General Wilson asked if he can accept brigade in North Africa.3. Situation in air force remains quiet, but it must be anticipated that, ifuse of arms becomes necessary in either of other services, trouble will break outin air force as well and that this might occur in any case.(38)Prime Minister to General Wilson.(Special Unnumbered.   Personal and Top Secret.) 7th April, 1944.You will have seen my telegrams to-day, Friday, to Mr. Leeper and to GeneralPaget. The minor - but none the less lamentable misfortunes which I foresawin my T.O.O. 052220 have now come to pass.   I do not consider that we should
desist from our efforts to get these troops into Italy as soon as possible, vehiculartransport being arranged locally when they arrive. Whether they can beembarked or not without, bloodshed must rest with.the Commander-in-Chief,Middle East; but the sooner they are out of where they are the better. you cannot convince me that the movement of three or four thousand men withoutvehicles can be any obstruction to the large movements which are proceedingand which you describe.   I am seeing Alexander to-morrow, Saturday, I hope.(T.O.O. 080130Z)(39)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 234.

I told themthat I was speaking to them at your urgent request and with your full authority.2. They have undertaken to stay at their posts until the King returns andto persuade their colleagues to do likewise. They have undertaken also at my request to support the three British Commanders-in-chief in any measures theythink necessary to take for the sake of military [group undecypherable:? security].3. For security reasons, I have only disclosed the date. of the King&apos;departure from England to the Crown Prince and Tsouderos. It so happens that further deterioration in the situation has made the Ministers so scared thismorning that they now desire the King&apos;s return clearly in order to throwresponsibility on to him. I have therefore told them that I will press for hisearliest return, thereby making it clear that responsibility for this step must rest with him. They cannot accuse us of foisting him on them. Can heythereforecome by the quickest possible route?4. I will, of course, assist the King when he arrives to the best of myability. I should be grateful if you would ask him to pay heed to what I say to him as he can count upon my loyalty to his best interests.5.   I have asked for further arrests to-day of certain agitators.6. I have been in conference during the morning with Commanders-in-chief,who have seen this telegram.(40)General Wilson to Prime Minister, repeated to C.I.G.S.(Special Unnumbered.  Top Secret and Private.) 8th April, 1944.Reference your special unnumbered signal T.O.O. 080130.1. Since telegraphing yesterday, have had report from Paget that situationin Greek forces has deteriorated to such an extent that disarmament by forcemay have to be resorted to.2. To despatch Greek units to Italy in present mutinous state would constitute a grave risk to other explosive elements, Poles, Yugoslavs, already inA.A.I. Alexander cannot spare British troops to keep order among mutinousAllies. Therefore suggest best solution appears to be to send such units as canbe salved in Greek brigade to New Zealanders to keep in order. But it wouldappear doubtful whether Alexander will be able to depend on them for active operations.  No doubt you will be discussing this question with Alexander.3.   I propose to isolate mutinous units in French North Africa or Libya.4. I have not communicated above to Paget in view of your signal to him,I will inform you as soon as I hear from Paget which units are fit to move toItaly.(T.O.O. 081100Z)
(41)Prime Minister to General Wilson.(Special Unnumbered.  Personal, Private and Secret.) 8th April, 1944.1.   Your 081100.I agree the situation has reached a point where we could not send them toItaly. I have had repeated to you my telegram to General Paget. In my view the events of the next few days will make the position much clearer. Evidentlythese troops should be disarmed by being encircled and deprived of supplies. Theyshould then be removed from contact with Cairo and treated considerately, our object being to get some fighting out of them. For this purpose it should be explained to the men what a shocking effect on the reputation of Greece will beproduced by its becoming known that they have mutinied on the eve of being sentto the front.   I have asked Paget to keep me constantly informed.2. I am very glad that agreement has been reached on the consultative committee about the King, Badoglio, &amp;c. As you know, this takes the form Ihave always desired, though I should probably not have succeeded in getting myway without the unexpected help of the Soviet Government, given albeit in theirindecorous manner.

Why do you leave out water ?Will this not bring the desired result quicker ? Obviously, these troops shouldbe disarmed. I agree that the hope of getting them to Italy may have to be abandoned. Keep me fully informed of plans for disarming. We cannot toleratepolitical revolutions carried out by foreign military formations for which weare ultimately responsible. In all cases large numbers of British troops shouldbe used so as to overawe and minimise bloodshed.(T.O.O. 082040Z)(43)General Paget to Prime Minister, repeated to General Wilson andGeneral Alexander.(CIC/332.

Before using force I am having situation made clear to all ranks and am hopeful that they will realise that further resistance is uselessand can only lead to bloodshed, which naturally am very anxious to avoid. Allaction being concerted with other Services and Mr. Leeper. Have asked general wilson to accept Brigade for further training North Africa when order restored.If delay in doing so I shall move Brigade Desert Camp, Daba.

See also my latest telegram to Mr. Leeper, which I&apos;have had repeated to you. You may find some arguments in it which might beused to the Greek Brigade.

I am sure firmness and patience, backed by overwhelming force, will bring these men back to their duty.(T.O.O. 102131B)(50)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 238.   Most Secret.) 10th April, 1944.My telegram No. 234.I spoke to M. Tsouderos at length to-day about the King&apos;s return. Hepromises to help him in every way possible, and to see that he is given time to.take his bearings after he arrives. His advice to the King will be to follow thepractice usual in Greece on these occasions and consult those individuals herewho have at one time or another held ministerial rank. This would make a goodimpression, and would at the same time give the King a few days in which todecide without being criticised for it.2. I told M. Tsouderos that if the King came to the conclusion that it wasbest for him to form a new Government, I felt sure that I could count upon himto accept as first period was going to be particularly difficult. At a result of present disorders British were shouldering heavy responsibilities in Greek affairs,and they must ask every Greek here who was called by the King to sharewith them what had now become a general responsibility for most rapidre-establishment of order.3. M. Tsouderos said he would [group undecypherable : ? accept] taskwithout hesitation if he were asked, unpleasant though it would be. If the Kingdecided to turn to him again he would, however, ask that all British services hereshould be instructed to give them their strong support and not listen tointrigues against him which would immediately be set on foot by many Greekshere. He would also ask you for support of the British press so that it might be quoted back into [six groups omitted] Tsouderos to rise to a big occasion as Ican see nobody else here on whom the King can place the same reliance. I donot think that a Government of officials would serve the King&apos;s interests unless he had a man of real political experience at the head.4. I have reason to hope that M. Papandreou is now on his way here. Heseems to be the best of the Athenian politicians.(51)Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo.(No. 138.   Personal and Secret.) %th April, 1944.Following from Prime Minister : 1. I was very glad to get your No. 234. You have done very well in a difficult situation and I am sure that a continuance of firmness on your part willgive the much-needed grit to the Greek politicians who are of any merit.2. Our relations are definitely established with the lawfully-constitutedGreek Government headed by the King, who is the ally of Britain and cannotbe discarded to suit a momentary surge of appetite among ambitious emigrenonentities. Neither can Greece find constitutional expression in particular sets of guerrillas, in many cases indistinguishable from banditti, who aremasquerading as the saviours of their country while living on the local villagers.If necessary I shall denounce these elements and tendencies publicly in order toemphasise the love Great Britain has for Greece, whose suffering she sharedin a small measure, being alas not then armed as we are now. Our only desireand interest is to see Greece a glorious, free nation in the Eastern Mediterranean,the honoured friend and ally of the victorious Powers. Let all, therefore, workfor this objective and make it quite clear that any failure in good conduct willnot be overlooked.
3. I bad been working very bard to arrange the movement of the Greekbrigade to Italy. Here they might still take part in the entry into Rome whichis to be expected during the summer. This brigade, the 1st Greek Brigade,representatives of the army which had beaten back the Italian invader and were only felled by the treacherous and brutal intervention of the German hordes, hadand still has the chance of raising the name of Greece high in the world. It is alamentable fact that they should have signalised this opportunity by anundignified, even squalid, exhibition of indiscipline which many will attributeto an unworthy fear of being sent to the front.4. In the same way the Greek Navy, which is full of daring seamen and isplaying a worthy part upholding its country&apos;s good name, should not suddenlyhave tried to meddle with politics and presume to dictate a Constitution to theGreek people. I believe that both of these two forces can be brought back to ahigh sense of national honour and duty if courageous leadership is forthcomingbacked by overwhelming force in reserve.5. All the time I have been planning to place Greece back high in thecounsels of the victorious nations. Witness how we have included them in theItalian Advisory Council and tried to send a brigade to take part in the impending victories in Italy. Greeks who are in safety in Egypt under ourprotection, equipped with our vessels or armed with our weapons or otherwise insecurity under the military authority of the British Commander-in-chief,Middle East, will place themselves in an abject and shameful position before allhistory if they allow their domestic feuds to mar their performance of the solemnduties to their country of which they have become the heirs. They may easily,by selfish, excitable behaviour, reduce Greece to a country without expressioneither at home or abroad and their names will be stained as long as history iswritten.6. The King is the servant of his people. He makes no claim to rule them.He submits himself freely to the judgment of the people as soon as normalconditions are restored. He places himself and his Royal House entirely at the disposition of the Greek nation. Once the German invader has been driven out,Greece can be a Republic or a Monarchy, entirely as the people wish. Why thencannot the Greeks keep their hatreds for the common enemy who has wroughtthem such cruel injuries and would obliterate them as a free people, were it not for the resolute exertions of the great Allies?7. You should use all these arguments freely in my name if necessary, both to the troops and to the sailors as well, of course, to the politicians who havebeen clattering around you. You may make it clear to them that this is the policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government and that we seek no advantage for ourselves andhave no interest but in the upholding of Greek independence, freedom and honour.8. A copy of this message is being sent to General Wilson, and you shouldpass copies to General Paget and Admirals Cunningham and Rawlings. you should associate them with you in your consultations with wayward or disorderlybodies. Above all you should make it clear unitedly that no mutinous demonstra-tions will be tolerated in forces which have been constitutionally placed under theAllied High Command, and that we are not in the least afraid of using the forcewe possess against lawless violence. We cannot have the main operations of thegreat Allies disturbed at this juncture. You should also pass a copy of the above to Lord Killearn for his information.  But I count on you to rise to the occasion.(52)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 240.   Secret.) 10th April, 1944.Following for the Prime Minister :  Your telegram No. 138.Arguments given for use amongst Greeks are most helpful. the commanders-in-chief have this in hand so far as Greek Army and Navy areconcerned.2. At our meeting this morning we agreed that your paragraph 6 would form an admirable statement for the King to issue on arrival here. Our proposals is that, when I meet him at the airfield, I should put this to him and ask whether he will agree that the announcement of his arrival should be accompanied bythis brief statement, which exactly expresses the constitutional position andshould help to bring a great many Greeks back to earth.
3.   I have consulted M. Tsouderos, who is equally pleased with the wordingand approves of the proposal we wish to put to the King.4.   The King can open very well if (a) he states his position publicly in a few dignified words;(6) he then puts this into practice by consulting his Ministers one by one-fatiguing but remunerative.5. When we are out of the wood here, which is still a bit of a jungle, I wishto put to you suggestions for dealing with E.A.M. in any public statement thatmay be made (see your paragraph 2). They have traded on prevailing ignorance of their misdeeds. A little plain speaking, at the right moment, from thecountry which the Greeks justly regard as their closest friend will do more than anything else to blow sky-high this propaganda of falsehood which lies behindour present troubles.(53)General Paget to Prime Minister.(CIC/335.  Personal and Top Secret.) Uth April, 1944.Thank you for your telegram No. OZ. 1868 of 9th April. Have appointedColonel Bourdaras to command 1 Greek Brigade in place of Colonel Pappas,who refused to obey my order to return to the Brigade and is now in arrest.Bourdaras has good record as soldier. He accompanied me to-day to Alexandria,and was with me when I met representatives of Greek Brigade who had askedto see me. I explained situation to representatives, and quoted from yourtelegram No. 138 of 9th April to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to GreekGovernment. I left them in no doubt as regards paragraph 8. Situation inBrigade is controlled by political extremists, including private soldiers. Majorityof senior officers appear to be under close arrest and some of the men. ThinkBourdaras might be shot by extremists in their present temper if he enteredcamp and attempted to address Brigade. If this happened, I should have to open fire. Do not wish to risk this until King has had opportunity to makepronouncement. Essential also co-ordinate action wth Navy and R.A.F. am therefore keeping Bourdaras out of camp for present. Hope my interview withrepresentatives to-day may have good effect.(54)Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo.(No. 144.   Personal and Top Secret.) 12th April, 1944.Following from Prime Minister :- For Commanders-in-Chief and others concerned : -1. There can be no question of making terms with mutineers about political matters. They must return to their duty unconditionally. They must submit tobe disarmed unconditionally.2. It would be a great pity to give any assurances about the non-punish-ment of ringleaders. It may well be that Courts-Martial, held under theauthority of the British Commander-in-Chief, will record severe sentences. Thequestion of clemency would rest with the King. Let me know how this standsbefore taking any decisive action.(55)Prime Minister to General Paget.(OZ. 1916.   Personal and Top Secret.) 12th April, 1944.Thank you for your CIC/335. Continue to keep me informed. See alsomy 144 to Mr. Leeper.
(56)Foreign Office to His ^Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo.(No. 143.   Secret.) \2th April, 1944.Following Personal from Prime Minister : Your telegram No. 240.By all means let the King of Greece see my whole message, and authorise him to express paragraph 6 as his own words if he chooses. There is no need for him to be hustled or denied opportunity for reflection. I agree with you that astatement should be made on his arrival, but this can be kept secret for a few hours, till he has settled down in his villa.(57)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 244.   Most Secret.) 11th April, 1944.My telegram No. 239.Novikov came to see me last night. He said that he had come forinformation.2. He asked why we were arresting so many Greeks. I replied that this was done on grounds of military security. He said there has been civilian as well as military arrests. What was reason for that? I said the reason was one I had given him; certain civilians had also been tampering with the army. Why hadwe only arrested members of the Left? Because, I said, they happened to beoffenders.   The Right would be treated in the same way if they offended.3. After listening patiently to a good deal more of this I pulled him uprather sharply. We were Allies I said, and in the common fight against Germanywe had our different tasks assigned to us. The defence of the Middle East was aBritish military task, and we intended to carry out our responsibilities there. I suggested that he should [ ? group omitted] us to do it.4. Novikov in reply asked whether I was implying that he had no right toreceive the Greeks who came to state their case. I said he had perfect right to seeanybody he liked, but I for my part had the right to say I hoped&quot; he would trust his principal ally rather than a number of unrepresentative Greek agitators. I askedwhether a Russian General, finding himself in the-same position as General Paget,would have acted with greater patience. I felt sure he would have been more severe, and we would not have criticised him for carrying out his military duties.Novikov hastened to say he was not criticising, merely asking for information.(58)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 247.) 12th April, 1944.My telegram No. 240.Following is text of the statement issued by His Majesty the King of theHellenes to-day:- &quot;T have returned to Cairo because the political crisis demands animmediate solution. When the enemy have been driven from onr land and greece has regained her liberty, the whole nation will be called upon to decideby a free vote upon the future regime under which they desire to be governed.Like every other citizen of Greece, I am at the disposal of the people and submit myself freely to their judgment as soon as calm conditions have been restored. Since the enemy are still tyrants in our country, we must haveoutside Greece a Government as representative as possible, made up of alltrends of patriotic opinion to the exclusion only of those who havecollaborated with the enemy. Such a Government will, of course, largely be composed of Greeks who have lived in their country under enemy occupation,and are thus conscious from their experience in the cities and in free mountainGreece of the real national interests of to-day. Arrangements are now inhand to bring these representatives here. We must all work together and concentrate our hate upon the enemy until the day of liberation. Let us putaside all internal and political discussions in the interests of the war effort ofthe United Nations.&quot;
(59)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 248.) 12th April, 1944.Second paragraph of King of Greece&apos;s declaration was made in full consulta-tion with Commander-in-Chief and myself. He accepted draft we submitted to.him after having heard from Commander-in-Chief an account of the situation inthe Greek armed forces.2. His Majesty yesterday received Tsouderos alone and later other membersof the Government. To-day, he has been receiving one by one members of theformer Government who happen to be in Cairo. He told me to-day that onTsouderos&apos;s advice he has agreed to see Nephouloudis, a former Communist Deputy,in order not to exclude any political party from his consultations. He questionedme about this to-day, and I told him that I thought he was acting wisely.(60)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 249.   Secret.) 12th April, 1944.At a meeting of the Commanders-in-Chief this afternoon, which was attended by Lord Killearn, Lord Moyne and myself, the Greek situation wasreviewed in all its bearings.2. It was agreed that if the orders given by the Commanders-in-Chief tothe Greek Brigade and Greek Fleet were not obeyed within the next few days,an ultimatum would have to be issued in both cases and, if not accepted wouldhave to be followed by the use of force.3 The consequent use of force would be serious and many-sided. Apartfrom the lasting ill-effect on Anglo-Greek relations, the probability of verybitter criticism in America and in Russia must be faced. A serious Egyptianproblem is also involved, especially in the case of Alexandria where Egyptiancasualties and damage to property could not be avoided.4. For these reasons it was agreed that the immediate task [group undecypherable : ? was to] make every endeavour to avoid a clash. The Brigadeis under control of fanatical extremist soldiers, though they are certainly a minority. They have been roughly estimated at 30 per cent. The position inthe fleet is probably not very dissimilar. Our task is to turn the majority away[group undecypherable: ? from the] minority who alone have everything to loseby obeying orders. This is being attempted by leaflets and by broadcasting. Thestatement issued by the King of Greece is also being made known to them.5. There is no guarantee whatever that these steps will be effective thoughthe ambassadors agreed that they must be tried. If they fail, the use of force can hardly be avoided.6. A suggestion has been made to us that the British, American and SovietAmbassadors to Greece should be authorised to make a joint statement to theeffect that &quot; in all matters pertaining to Allied policy regarding the present political disturbances in, and employment of Greek armed forces in the middle east, the United States and Soviet Governments are in complete agreement withthe British Government.&quot;7. While feeling we should report this suggestion, we see the serious disadvantages in inviting the Soviet Government to play any part even of this nature in this theatre. It also seems most unlikely that they would agree to any declaration sufficiently explicit to serve a useful purpose. Moreover, the time factor probably rules it out.8. &quot;We are gravely handicapped by the absence of any Greek personalitywho can assist us. At the moment we have not in statu quo got a Greek Govern-ment. As soon as the King has entrusted the formation of a Government to anew Prime Minister, we shall insist on the lattefr immediately meeting the delegations of the brigade and fleet and explaining to them that the new government is inviting representatives of all [group undecypherable : ? shades]of patriotic opinion to co-operate.
(61)General Paget to Prime Minister.(0/91645.   Personal and Most Secret.) ISth April, 1944.Situation Greek brigade shows signs of improvement. Twenty-seven mensurrendered to us last night. They report rations in camp finished and that my interview with representatives had sobering effect on extremists. Leafletsgiving King&apos;s proclamation dropped on camp this morning by aircraft. Willsend you further report to-morrow.(62)Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo.(No. 145.   Personal and Secret.) 14th April, 1944.Following from Prime Minister to Mr. Leeper and all principalsconcerned : i1. Your telegram No. 249. Surely you should let lack of supplies work its part both in the camp and the harbour before resorting to fire. Your paragraph 3is obvious but should not deter you from using the weapon of blockade to thefull and defending yourselves against attempts to break out. Do not worrytoo much about these external effects.2. Do not show yourself over-eager to parley. Simply keep them roundedup by artillery and superior force and let hunger play its part.3. Your paragraph 6. On no account accept any assistance from Americanor Russian sources, otherwise than as specially enjoined by me. You have ampleforce at your disposal and plenty of time. It is much more important that theyshould be reduced to proper discipline than that any particular Greek Govern -ment should be set up. It would even be harmful if a brigade and a flotilla hadbeen permitted to meddle in political issues.4. General Paget&apos;s 0/91645, which is my latest information, reports thatthe situation of the Greek Brigade shows signs of improving and that they havefinished their rations. You should take full advantage of these tendencies and keep me informed.(63)Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo.(No. 146.   Secret and Personal.) 14*A April, 1944.Following from Prime Minister : 1. If the mutineers remain recalcitrant for some days and only return totheir duty when a Greek Government is formed to their liking, they will have tobe proceeded against for attempting to dictate to the Civil Government and foracts of indiscipline against the British Supreme Commander under whoseauthority they have been placed. There can be no question of making terms withmutineers or letting them think they have had any part in political changes.2. Do not be influenced by possible anti-British sentiment among the localGreeks. It would be a great mistake to end this grave business up in a pleasantkiss all round. That might come later as an act of clemency from the King andhis new Government. We have got to get these men into our hands disarmed,without conditions, and I trust without bloodshed.(64)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 252.   Secret.) 14th April, 1944.My telegram No. 248.King of the Hellenes sent for me yesterday evening and told me that, as aresult of his consultations, he was entrusting to M. Venizelos the formation of
new Government. He would ask him to keep it small for the present until newblood could be introduced from Greece. He would also insist that it should be composed not of M. Venizelos&apos;s friends, but of suitably chosen people.2. After dinner the King sent M. Venizelos round to see me. He was full of goodwill, but I need hardly warn you he is weak and easily influenced. He askedfor my full support and that of all our services at this difficult moment. I pro-promised him every assistance.3. I then told M. Venizelos that there were two things I must ask him to doat once. He must next day make a statement backing British Commanders-in-Chief up to the hilt. Their orders must be obeyed and there could be no compromise-mise on that point. He must go the whole way with us. I also suggested that, asGreek Easter came this week, he should send Archbishop Karystos in Eutene, theChaplain-General of the Greek forces, to the camp of the Brigade. He is aneloquent and fearless speaker and has hitherto been successful in stirringemotions of the soldiers.  M. Venizelos promised to send him at once.4. The other request I made was for a list of the delegates to be invitedhere from Greece. Our services were ready to bring them here at once and theremust be no delay. The invitation must come from legally constituted Government.He promised I should have such a list during the following morning.5. I told M. Venizelos that, after consultation with General Paget, I had suggested to the King, who had agreed, that when the delegates arrived from greece, the conference should take place in the Lebanon and not in Cairo. Wecould not have delegates from E.A.M. here until, as a result of the conference,they had joined the Government on agreed terms. If they refused to co-operatethey would be sent back to Greece. M. Venizelos heartily assented. I said that,if he needed my assistance during the conference, I would go to Beirut and be inclose touch.  He begged me to do so.6. M. Venizelos will bring me later to-day a list of his Ministers, with their offices. The Government will probably be rather more than four Ministers. last night he spoke of M. Exintaris as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I think thiswould be appropriate at the moment. M. Exintaris began life as a diplomatist.He is calm and tactful and a non-[group undecypherable : ? controversial]character.7. The King himself has definitely made a good beginning. He has been anxious to help us in every way and I think he appreciates what we have beendoing to help him. According to our information, which M. Venizelos confirms,the King&apos;s declaration has made a favourable impression among Greeks generally&apos;8. I think the King has in existing circumstances made the right choice.He realises that M. Tsouderos can be more useful later than at present. I regret that change has become necessary, as M. Tsouderos is much the better man. i hope the British will pay a tribute to M. Tsouderos for his services. He is ourvery good friend and it is important that we should have reputation for standing by our friends.9.   I will telegraph further any later developments.(65)General Paget to Prime Minister.(CIC/341.   Personal and Top Secret.) 14th April, 1944.One Officer seven other ranks surrendered to us last night from GreekBrigade. They report dropping of pamphlets has produced very sobering effecton extremists and great encouragement to loyal element.Reconnaissance to-day shows some guns pointing into camp instead of as previously outwards. This may indicate increased dissensions in the Brigade.Further leaflets dropped by aircraft to-day and seen to be well distributed amongthe troops.   Food reported very short except for sheep and camels.Probable that Chaplain-General, Greek Forces, will visit camp to-morrowto address the Brigade. 16th April being Easter Sunday for Orthodox ChurchI think he will get a hearing and be a good influence.
2i Q(66)&apos;v-.&apos;0 General Wilson to Prime Minister, repeated to C.I.G.S.(Special Unnumbered.   Personal and Top Secret.) lAth April, 1944.Reference your Special Unnumbered Signal T.O.O. 082050.1. I have been informed by Paget that all Greek Army Units are affected bydisturbances. All these units will-have to be purged thoroughly of extremistelements and reorganised before they can be used in active operations.&apos; - 2. I have pointed out to Paget the need for getting these troops out ofEgypt as soon as possible and isolating them from Communist influences in bigtowns. I have proposed Tripolitania or Cyrenaica west of Tobruk as suitableareas for isolating them. I have said that I am prepared to accept the GreekBrigade later for training with a British formation with a view to sendingthem eventually to Italy, but this will be conditional on their future discipline.3. I think it is better that these Greeks should be sent first to Cyrenaicaor Tripolitania. If they come to French North Africa, they might contactFrench Communists in Algiers.4. I have seen your telegram Number Foreign Office 138 of 9th april to Mr. Leeper repeated Resident Minister Algiers, stating that in view of Greekpolitical situation you may find it necessary to denounce E.A.M. activitiespublicly. Both Paget and I think that if an open breach with E.A.M. becomes necessary it would make things difficult and dangerous for our military mission in Greece. Our missions are trying to prevent any further outbreaks of civilstrife among the various guerrilla bands and are doing their best to stimulateresistance against the enemy.We are unfortunately mainly dependent on E.A.M. organisation not only for activities in Greece against enemy troops and communications but also for providing harbourage for our personnel. I think it is important that we should try to keep the movement active throughout this summer.5. There can be no doubt of harm which E.A.M. sympathisers andagitators have done amongst the Greek forces in Middle East. But I thought Ishould inform you of my views on possible reaction inside Greece from purely military aspect, now that His Majesty&apos;s Governments relations with E.A.M.are under consideration.(T.O.O. 141910Z)(67)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Of/ice.(No. 255)Your telegram No. 146. 15th April, 1944.Following for Prime Minister : I would like you to know how close the co-operation is between all serviceshere. We are all in agreement that orders must be obeyed without any corn-promise or parleying. I impressed this on Venizelos from the moment he took office and I shall hold him to it absolutely.2. I have never been without hope that by a united and firm front we shallwin a complete and bloodless victory and teach the Greek armed forces a lessonwhich will be to their own good. I am not in the least swayed by any temporaryunpopularity we may incur here. What Greeks are worth having on our sidewill respect us for it.3. Our object is to produce a situation in which loyal Greeks will them-selves deal with their own mutineers without our having to use force ourselves.We are making some progress and will continue until we win through. when that has happened the punishment of the guilty must be drastic.4. It is most helpful to have your solid backing and we shall do our utmost to produce the result that you desire.
(68)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 256.  Secret.) 15th April, 1944.Extreme left elements, by active and unscrupulous propaganda, have,temporarily at any rate, paralysed the whole of Greece&apos;s war effort in theMiddle East. They are the same people who, under the name of E.A.M., havedivided Greek resistance movement at home. This state of affairs should be checked by a clear plan of action. I submit the following proposals for dealingwith it:  2. Mutinies in the Greek forces here are being dealt with [group undecypherable : ? as a] purely military question, no political considerationdeterring us from compelling obedience to orders by Commander-in-Chief andpunishing the guilty. There is a not unreasonable hope that success will beachieved without having to resort to the use of our preponderance of force.3. Meanwhile arrangements are in hand for bringing all political parties and guerrilla organisations to a conference in the Middle East in order to secure an all-embracing coalition Government. It may be that the acute cleavage whichE.A.M. have produced here may make an agreement easier, provided that wedefeat conclusively their action among the Greek forces. Unless we do this, anyattempt at an understanding can be ruled out. The moderate parties would loseconfidence in themselves and in us and the extremists would feel no need to comeinto line.4. I submit therefore that as soon as possible before the forthcoming conference opens, His Majesty&apos;s Government should approach the United Statesand Soviet Governments, preferably - on the highest level, and speak in thefollowing terms : *5. &quot; British Commanders-in-Chief will discharge alone and to the full their military responsibilities in the Middle East in putting down acts of indisciplinein the Greek forces under their command. His Majesty&apos;s Government do not seek to involve their Allies in harassing matters for which they accept full responsibility. They wish, however, to call on their Allies to join them in helping to put an end to internal strife in Greece which is hampering the war effort of the United Nations, and which has been skilfully fostered by the enemy.The three-Power declaration in support of the Greek Governments effort to stopcivil war between the guerrillas helped powerfully to achieve the desired result.A similar declaration is now called for in order to encourage all Greek parties and organisations when they meet in conference to achieve a united politicalfront against the enemy until their country is liberated.&quot;6.   Above is a rough outline of the proposal I am submitting to you.I sounded the King on it and found him in hearty agreement.7.   Advantages I see are the following :  (a) If Russians play, E.A.M. can hardly refuse to co-operate with other parties on agreed terms.(b) It would put an end to any imprudent action taken by my Sovietcolleague here. M. Novikov, with no knowledge or experience of greek affairs, has, I suspect, been encouraging revolutionariesover-much.(c) If E.A.M. still refuse to present a united front with all other parties,we shall be free to break with them, and expose what they have donein destroying Greek unity, both in Greece and in Middle East.8. With progress of Russian armies in Roumania there is now a pressingneed to secure as united a front as possible amongst Greeks. E.A.M. can begiven their last chance to join this front, but if they refuse, we should, I suggest,rally our friends and be prepared to break once and for all with those who havenever sincerely co-operated with us and have been mainly responsible for thepresent discords in Greece and Middle East.(69)Prime Minister to Gsmeral Wilson.(Special Unnumbered.   Top Secret and Personal.) lQth April, 1944.1. The first thing is to have the mutineers quelled and the troops and sailors disarmed and sent elsewhere under guard where they are out of touchwith agitators..
2. The question of the Government of Greece is a political matter, and isbeing settled by the best constitutional procedure available.3. The relations with E.A.M. will be related to these settlements(paragraph 2).4. You will no doubt have seen my telegrams on all these three subjects.I have given up any hope of the Greek Brigade fighting for several months.(T.O.O. 161535Z)(70)Prime Minister to President Roosevelt.(No. 648.   Personal and Top Secret.) IMh April, 1944.You will be aware of the disturbances which have broken out among theGreek Armed Forces in the Middle East and of the difficulties which have arisenwith the Greek Government in Cairo.2. The outbreak in the Greek Army and Navy followed closely on theestablishment in the mountains of Greece of the Political Committee sponsored by E.A.M., and there is little doubt that the extremist elements who have long been working to subvert the allegiance of the Greek forces to their legitimateKing and Government seized on this as a heaven-sent opportunity for open andviolent action. The dissident elements are undoubtedly opposed to the king and in favour of a republic, but throughout the disturbances there have been almost no direct attacks on the King&apos;s personal position, and the only specificdemand put forward is that the Greek Government should take immediate and effective steps to recognise and associate with themselves the Political Committeein Greece.3. This crisis came at a particularly unfortunate moment since M. Tsouderoshad already sent an invitation to a number of moderate politicians in Athensurging them to come to Cairo to join the Government. He had also invitedrepresentatives of E.A.M., the Communist-controlled organisation which has created and now dominates the Political Committee. Tsouderos was thus doing everything in his power to create a truly representative Greek Government.4. In this programme he had the support of his colleagues and they appearto have had no hand in provoking the disturbances in the Greek forces. But theywere extremely jealous of Tsouderos&apos;s position and used the trouble in the greek army, which was at first on a small scale, to get rid of him. Feeling that he had lost control of the situation, Tsouderos resigned and proposed Venizelos for thepremiership. The trouble in the Greek Army rapidly spread to the Navy andassumed the proportions of a full-scale mutiny in both forces. The politiciansin Cairo realised that the matter had gone beyond one of personal rivalries orambitions, and their only thought was to find some candidate for the premiershipsufficiently notorious for his left-wing views to be acceptable to the mutinouselements in the forces.5. The King of Greece was reluctant to accept a new Government whosecomposition was in effect dictated by the mutineers. He considered that orderin the Greek Armed Forces must be restored before any lawful reconstruction of the Government could be undertaken. I entirely agreed with him andinstructed our Ambassador to the Greek Government to do his utmost to induce the Greek Ministers to remain at their posts until the King could get back to cairo and take stock of the situation. This, I am glad to say, they agreed todo. I also gave instructions to the military authorities in the Middle East todeal firmly with indiscipline in the Greek Forces under their command. Order inthe Greek Army and Navy has not been completely re-established, but thedissident elements are being isolated, and once the ringleaders are under arrestthe mutiny should rapidly subside.6. The King of Greece has now reached Cairo and, after studying theposition for himself, has formed a Government under M. Venizelos. For thefuture I have informed our Ambassador to the Greek Government that he shouldbe guided by the following considerations: &quot;Our relations are definitely established with-the lawfully-constitutedGreek Government headed by the King, who is the ally of Britain and cannotbe discarded to suit a momentary surge of appetite among ambitious emigrenonentities. Neither can Greece find constitutional expression in particularsets of guerrillas, in many cases indistinguishable from banditti, who are
masquerading as the saviours of their country while living on the localvillagers. If necessary I shall denounce these elements and tendenciespublicly in order to emphasise the love Great Britain has for Greece, whosesuffering she shared in a small measure, being alas not then armed as weare now. Our only desire and interest is to see Greece a glorious, free nationin the Eastern Mediterranean, the honoured friend and ally of the victoriousPowers. Let all, therefore, work for this objective and make it quite clearthat any failure in good conduct will not be overlooked.&quot; I had been working very hard to arrange the movement of the GreekBrigade in Italy. Here they might still take part in the entry into Romewhich is to be expected during the summer. This Brigade, the 1st GreekBrigade, representatives of the army which had beaten back the Italianinvader and were only felled by the treacherous and brutal intervention ofthe German hordes, had and still has the chance of raising the name of Greecehigh in the world. It is a lamentable fact that they should have signalisedthis opportunity by an undignified, even squalid, exhibition of indisciplinewhich many will attribute to an unworthy fear of being sent to the front.&quot; In the same way the Greek Navy, which is full of daring seamen andis playing a worthy part upholding its country&apos;s good name, should notsuddenly have tried to meddle with politics and presume to dictate a constitution to the Greek people. I believe that both of these two forces canbe brought back to a high sense of national honour and duty if courageousleadership is forthcoming backed by overwhelming force in reserve.&quot; All the time I have been planning to place Greece back high in thecounsels of the victorious nations. Witness how we have included them inthe Italian Advisory Council and tried to send a Brigade to take part inthe impending victories in Italy. Greeks who are in safety in Egypt under our protection, equipped with our vessels or armed with our weapons orotherwise in security under the military authority of the British Commander-in-Chief. Middle East, will place themselves in an abject and shamefulposition before all history if they allow their domestic feuds to mar theirperformance of the solemn duties to their country, of which they have become the heirs. They may easily, by selfish, excitable behaviour, reduce Greeceto a country without expression either at home or abroad, and their nameswill be stained as long as history is written.&quot; The King is the servant of his people. He makes no claim to rule them.He submits himself freely to the judgment of the people as soon as normalconditions are restored. He places himself and his Royal House entirelyat the disposition of the Greek Nation. Once the German invader has been driven out, Greece can be a Republic or a Monarchy, entirely as the peoplewish. Why then cannot the Greeks keep their hatreds for the common enemywho has wrought them such cruel injuries and would obliterate them as a free people, were it not for the resolute exertions of the Great Allies? &quot;7. In sending these instructions I have asked Ambassador Leeper to make use of all these arguments freely in my name, if necessary, both to the troops andto the sailors, as well, of course, as to the politicians, who have been clatteringaround him. In making it clear to them that this is the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, I have asked him to emphasise that we seek no advantage for ourselves and have no interests but in the upholding of Greek independence,freedom and honour.(71)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 258.  Top Secret.) &apos; 16th April, 1944.My telegram No. 224.M. Venizelos told me yesterday of his first interview with my Sovietcolleague. He told M. Novikov that he hoped to receive the support of the SovietGovernment in the difficult task with which the King had entrusted him.2. M. Novikov replied that surely the Red Army was giving every help tothe speedy liberation of Greece. M. Venizelos, according to the account he gaveme, assured the Soviet Ambassador that he was full of admiration for the achieve-ments of the Red Army, but the question he had put referred to difficulties here.
3. M. Novikov rather clumsily retorted that his Government had been taking great interest in Greek affairs, but that recent events here might change,their [group undecypherable: ? attitude]. He referred particularly to arrestswhich had been made. M. Venizelos said that these arrests had been made by theBritish authorities on purely military grounds. To this M. Novikov replied&apos; thathe had already heard this form of pretext.4. M. Venizelos&apos;s comment to me was that M. Novikov had been mixinghimself injudiciously in Greek affairs and accepting everything that the extremeLeft told him. He said he had reported this conversation to the GreekAmbassador in London, who may be able to supply you with a fuller account ofwhat occurred.(72)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 259.   Secret.) \Uh April, 1944.My telegram No. 246.M. Papandreou, who arrived here yesterday, came to see me to-day. He istall, has a good presence, knows what he wants and is not afraid to say so. Heis the first Greek who has arrived from Greece who impresses me as a leader. Iam glad to say that the King, with whom I compared notes afterwards, has the-same impression and is equally pleased.2. M. Papandreou&apos;s views on the present situation are roughly as follows :E.A.M., when they began the struggle against the Italian occupying forces,served the interests of the nation. Since then they have betrayed the nation bytrying to monopolise power by preventing formation of a national army insideGreece.   This must be stopped at once.3. &quot; One people, one Government, one army &quot; must be the programme of anational Government to be formed here as quickly as possible. There must be nodelay. The representatives of the guerrilla organisations must be told to comeat once. They should be given a date by which negotiations will begin. If theydelay the National Government must be formed without them, leaving placesopen for them if they will join in on an agreed basis. It is desirable inthe national interest that E.A.M. should participate, as they possess a certaindynamism which should be harnessed to the common cause. If they refuse, thereasons for their refusal should be explained boldly and clearly to the nation.4. The present guerrilla organisations must be transformed into a nationalarmy. In their present form they are a disaster to Greece and offer no seriousresistance to the Germans. They enable the Germans to raise security battalions in order to fight the Communists. With a national army security battalionswould disappear.5.   He would ask three things from His Majesty&apos;s Government : (a) Full support to be given to the national Government when formed and only to the national Government.(b) Complete cessation of arms to E.A.M. if they refuse to join.(c) Co-operation with General Headquarters, Middle East, in the creationof a national army.6. I asked M. Papandreou whether he thought that E.A.M. would acceptthe programme he outlined. He said he was not sure. Much would depend on the drive and determination shown by those who were working for the programme.There had been too much delay and hesitation in the past. If that now ceased itwas not too late to retrieve the situation.7. He told me that he was frankly horrified by the position here. Themutiny in the armed forces must be suppressed. On that basis alone could a proper Government be formed. I asked him, as one who had just arrived from athens, to write a statement for Greek First Brigade and Fleet telling them their duty. He promised to do so at once, I told him that it must first be approved byCommander-in-Chief.  He agreed.8. I saw the King later. He was extremely pleased with his own interview with M. Papandreou and said he was the obvious Prime Minister for the occasion.M. Venizelos was a mere stop-gap and the sooner the change could be made the better. I gathered from the King that he had already broached the question withM. Papandreou and felt that the latter would probably persuade M. Venizeloshimself that this was the best course.   I should not be surprised if M. Venizelos,
after a few days&apos; enjoyment of his high office, gladly transferred responsibility to firmer hands.9. M. Papandreou asked me not to judge his people by what I hadexperienced here. He said they were wholly for Allied cause, and for Britain inparticular, and that if resistance in Greece could be put on a proper national basis we would quickly notice a difference.(73)Prime Minister to Lord Gort, Governor and Commander-in-Chief,Malta, and to Naval Commander-in-Chief.(OZ. 1986.   Personal and Top Secret.) 17*A April, 1944.You are responsible for preserving order in this British port. It isintolerable that events like those described in paragraph 2 of No. 121914 Aprilfrom V.A. Malta should take place in Malta harbour. There can be no questionof naval ratings meddling in politics. It is far better that their ships shouldnot go on patrol, and, if necessary, the personnel should be disarmed and interned.Make sure that, in this case, overwhelming force is available on the spot, so thatthere is no chance of resistance being successful. This saves bloodshed. Utilizeof course to the full friendly or loyal elements. I repeat, no indiscipline can be tolerated in a British harbour. Never mind whether they will &quot;fight with theAllies.&quot; Their first duty is to obey the orders of the British Naval Commander-in-Chief, under whom all Greek naval forces in the Mediterranean are placed.No compact with mutineers. The future Government of Greece is not to bedecided by groups of sailors on particular ships, the most of which we havegiven them.I am quite sure I can count on you to act with firmness as well as with tact.A full explanation of what has already occurred should be furnished me bytelegraph. Also report whether you have sufficient forces available and arrange-ments will be made to support you.(74)Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo.(No. 154.

Molotov pointing out that mutinies in the army and navy could not be tolerated, and asking for his support.

Novikov.(75)&quot;Prime Minister to Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean.(Personal and Top Secret.) 17th April, 1944.You should leave the senior member of the Averoff in no doubt that hisguarantee that the use of firearms will be avoided will not be reciprocated by us.We shall fire on mutineers wherever it is necessary. No officers or sailors of theGreek navy have the slightest right to meddle in the formation of the new Govern-ment. Their duty is to obey the orders they receive from the Greek government recognised by the great Allies.(T.O.O. 171642B)

Then will be the time to addressour Allies on future collaboration. I have as you know already sent a message to M. Molotov.(77)Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, to Admiralty.(Top Secret.) 18th April, 1944.  .Greek ships in Egypt are still in a state of disaffection amounting tomutiny. The present policy is to persuade the Greek Authorities to put theirown house in order, the use of British force to overcome the mutineers being reserved        last resort.2.   The following guiding principles are to be observed : (a) Greek officers are not to be relieved of their duties by Greek action without the authority of the Greek Commander-in-Chief.(b) There is to be no truck with committees or other mutinous bodies.(c) No political questions are to be discussed with the Greeks.3. The line to be taken in event of Greek truculence is that their dutyis to obey the orders of the Allied Commander-in-Chief under whose orders theGreek Naval Forces are placed and that it is not for groups of sailors on boardGreek ships however to decide on the future Greek Government.4. Any assurance given by the Greeks that the use of firearms will be avoided should not be reciprocated. It should be made perfectly clear that weshall fire on mutineers wherever it is necessary.(T.O.O. 181151C)(78)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 260.   Secret.) 17 th April, 1944.At a meeting of Commanders-in-Chief this afternoon, at which I was present, Admiral Cunningham reported a most unsatisfactory conversation hehad had with Admiral Alexandris, the Greek Commander-in-Chief. As thelatter, in spite of having received instructions from Venizelos to order CaptainToumbas to collect a party to board and seize two Greek ships, failed to passon the order, the operation had to be cancelled for to-night. Admiral Cunninghamfelt it was imperative that the Greeks themselves should carry out this operationinstead of calling on us to do it.2. On the political side, I strongly supported this view and suggested thatthe Admiral and I should at once see the King and ask him to force Venizelosto see that his orders were carried out. Admiral Cunningham and I accordinglyvisited the King and explained the position. I told His Majesty that Isuspected that Venizelos was now entirely defeatist about E.A.M. and would do everything he could to evade any action which [ % group omitted : ? if ] E.A.M.triumphed, would endanger his life. I suspected that he was trying to reinsurehimself already with E.A.M. and was therefore quite unfit for the post heoccupied. In spite of this I felt that His Majesty with our support should notlet him escape his responsibilities.3. The King who remained calm throughout, though he did not hesitate to express his contempt for those who were shirking at this moment, agreed withthis view. He said that he did not wish, if he could avoid it, to bring Papandreou[27363] &apos;       f(76)
in as Prime Minister until the mutiny had been quelled, although the latter would be ready to take over at once if called upon.4. As Venizelos happened to be waiting in another room, the King calledhim in to face us. Venizelos, when confronted by His Majesty with AdmiralAlexandris&apos;s defection, admitted he must be dismissed for disobeying orders and proposed to replace him by Admiral Voulgaris, Minister for Air in the lastGovernment. He said that he had already sounded him and hoped to have hisanswer by to-morrow.5. As we all regarded this delay as quite unsatisfactory, Venizelos was compelled to go to Admiral Voulgaris at once and extract a positive answerfrom [ ? group omitted :  ? him] to-night.6. After dinner Venizelos telephoned to me to say that Admiral Voulgarismust have further time to consider and would give his answer to-morrow. Irefused to accept this and insisted on a positive answer at once. Half an hourlater I received it. Admiral Voulgaris will fly to Alexandria early to-morrowmorning having agreed to carry out the operation. There may be furtherattempts at evasion to-morrow.7. These are the people we are dealing with at the moment, but we havea chance of getting what we want even out of them, thus saving the Greek navyfrom complete disgrace.(79)President Roosevelt to Prime Minister.(No. 523.

No one could be more loth than I am to pander to the political fanaticismof Greek sailors, but my object hitherto has been to persuade the Greeks to settheir own house in order and until this has been attempted to defer action byBritish forces.5. I have overwhelming force at Alexandria, which is the heart of the trouble, and am confident that the Naval mutineers can be overcome there if wehave to resort to British action.__(T.O.O. 181114C)(84) .General Paget to Prime Minister.(CIC/345.   Personal and Top Secret.) 18th April, 1944.Since my last report to you on 14th April there have been no major develop-ments in situation of 1 Greek Brigade. I decided not to allow Greek Chaplain-General to visit camp, as address by him was bound to be political as well asreligious and would weaken my statement to mutineers that my order forsurrender is a military one and is not concerned with politics. Loyalists whocontinue to surrender in small numbers to our posts by day and night state foodnow very short, but extremists still prepared to resist if we use force. Althoughsituation is causing great inconvenience to me, I consider we should continue toavoid use of force for as long as possible and am still hopeful of avoidingbloodshed.2. Greek Brigade and Greek Sacred Squadron in Syria have sent memessages of loyalty and devotion to duty.

He has had a further talk to Papandreou, whom he wants to appointPrime Minister as soon as possible, Venizelos having already proved himselfincompetent and unreliable in this crisis. He wishes Papandreou, however, tocome in under [group undecypherable : ? both Governments&apos;] auspices and notto be regarded as purely a King&apos;s man or as one who had intrigued for himself.3. He therefore asks whether, when he makes the change, he could tellVenizelos that, in view of the critical situation and heavy responsibilities whichhad fallen on the British Commander-in-Chief, you had asked him to appointsomebody to share those responsibilities with us who had recently arrived from greece and had therefore played no part in recent events.(87)Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, to Admiralty.(Top Secret and Personal.) 19^ April, 1944.For Prime Minister from Lord Gort: Your OZ. 1986 received by me after my arrival in Algiers.

Elas are now reported tobe attacking small Zervas forces in Makrynor[group undecypherable] (infgroupundecypherable] Tos) and they have also launched a full-scale attack on Ekka in
the course of which Colonel Psaros has been killed in action. It may thereforebe considered that civil war between the Andartes in Greece has begun again.2. I have agreed with Commander-in-chief that publicity should be with-held until we can choose the right moment in connexion with the situation here.Announcement would be made coincident with any action taken by Commanders-in-chief.(90)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 265.  Top Secret.) 20*A April, 1944.My telegram No. 263.Central Committee of Communist Party and of E.A.M. have both telegraphedto the Greek Government that, unless Political Committee, now reformed underthe presidency of Svollos, is also invited to forthcoming conference, they themselves cannot send representatives.2. All these three bodies are in reality one and the same thing. the argument that E.A.M. and Political Committee are somewhat wider than theCommunist party is, on the present showing, purely propaganda. It is onlyamong the deluded Greek forces in the Middle East and uninformed opinionabroad that this propaganda is believed.3. Before showing the above message to M. Venizelos I consulted the king of Greece this morning. He agreed that a refusal to accept would play into thehands of E.A.M., who would accuse the King and his Government of sabotagingthe conference and the whole conception of national unity. I told His Majestythat M. Venizelos would swallow any-blackmail in order to appease revolutionariesand that, though I must pass on this information to him as Prime Minister, Iwould do so on condition that he kept it to himself, and would tell him that, ifhe failed to do so, I should not be able to collaborate with him further. The Kingapproved.4. I doubt if M. Venizelos has ever kept a political secret in his life.I need only quote one instance. When the Prime Minister last December informed him that he would try to get the Greek Brigade sent to Italy it was known to every Greek in Cairo the following day. I am therefore telling him the bareminimum until the day when he can be replaced by somebody in whom we can have confidence.5. Arrangements are being made to bring representatives of guerrillas andof political parties in Athens to the Middle East. They should be here by the endof the month. It is proposed to hold the conference in Syria and to make sure that delegates do not come to Cairo.(91)General Paget to C.I.G.S.(0/94167.   Personal and Top Secret.) 21st April, 1944.1. I consider that I have now allowed Greek Brigade enough time to come toheel, and in view of this and possibility of political crisis arising in Egypt Iintend to enforce disarmament on Greek Brigade. Attempt was to have beenmade to-night by loyal Greek officers to board two ships in Alexandria harbourwith a view to regaining control, but they have jibbed and postponed untilto-morrow night: If loyal Greek officers jib again to-morrow I have agreed withCommander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, that we both issue ultimatum on Sunday,23rd, and enforce surrender on Monday, 24th. If loyal Greek officers take action and are successful in boarding two ships, they will require two days to prepare to board remainder. I shall not, in this case, take action against Brigade untilTuesday or Wednesday.
(91a)First Sea Lord to Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, repeated toGeneral   Wilson.(Personal and Top Secret.) 22nd April, 1944.From First Sea Lord : You must be the best judge of how this matter should be carried out, butin the event of the Greek Commander-in-Chief being unwilling or unable toproduce sufficient forces to carry the insubordinate ships by boarding, have youconsidered torpedoing the Hephaistos by M.T.B. after due warning to surrenderor abandon ship ?2. I feel this drastic show of force would induce all the remaining ships to surrender for fear of bringing the same fate on themselves.3. It has the further advantage to my mind of not involving risk to the lives of British sailors in bring mutinous Greeks to their senses.4. It would, of course, be necessary to make all arrangements to sweep thedecks of Flephaistos with machine-gun fire should they open up on the M.T.Bs.(T.O.O. 221654B)(92)C.I.G.S. to General Paget.(88950.

You are clearly in the best position to judge what action should be taken against the mutineers, and you are authorised to take whatever action youconsider necessary; but you should consider how far instructions to Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, may influence any plan you have in mind.(93)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 266.  Top Secret.) 22nd April, 1944.My telegram No. 259.King of the Hellenes outlined to-day plan on which he is working. He willawait the result of to-night&apos;s operation when the Greeks themselves are toattempt to seize two mutinous ships. If that attempt fails and British have todo the job afterwards, he will quickly bring in M. Papandreou as PrimeMinister; if he succeeds, he may wait for a few days before invitingM. Papandreou to take over. One argximent he will use is that, before delegates from Greece arrive for political conference, he must have at the head of theGovernment a leader who has been all the time in Greece.2. His Majesty asked me to see M. Papandreou and speak to him with complete frankness. I was to tell him that I knew fully what was in the King&apos;mind as regards himself. I did so at once. He told me he was ready to takeover at any moment the King desired. During the past week he had seen manyGreeks, and he wanted me to know how grateful he and they were to BritishCommanders-in-Chief for the patience they had shown under. very tryingconditions. He himself would never forget this proof of British friendship to greece. If, owing to failure of his own people to deal with these mutinies,British had to use force themselves, he would explain the whole position franklyto his fellow-countrymen.3. He then outlined first steps he would take on assuming office. He would invite M. Venizelos to remain as Minister of National Defence and wouldprobably add two [group undecypherable : ? members] to Government. Hewould then be ready to take charge of political conference and face E.A.M.delegates, but he asked me particularly whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would at once make a brief statement welcoming formation of his Government and supporting the objects of political conference. This would greatly strengthenhis hands before he met E.A.M.4. He thought it unlikely that E.A.M. would join a real national coalition[group undecypherable] the King and he were most anxious that we should bring their representatives to Middle East and make no statement against them in
public until he had their [group undecypherable: ? promise] to play straight.If they proved false he would denounce them before the Greek people and would ask us to associate ourselves with his attitude.5. M. Papandreou concluded by saying that moral paralysis which hadseized upon the Greeks here could only be cured by determined leadership. Hehad complete faith in himself as he knew he was acting as the standard-bearerof the real spirit of resistance inside Greece. His task was to conduct a crusadefor National Unity both here and by broadcasts into Greece.6. His words have ring of sincerity. I am told that he had reputation ofbeing the best speaker in the Greek Parliament. It will not take long to testhis co-operation as man of action as there is every need for quick and determinedaction.   The King is certainly placing his faith in him.(94)Flag Officer, Levant and Eastern Mediterranean, to Admiralty.(Top Secret.) 22nd April, 1944.Request you will pass following message to Greek Ships and Authoritiesin Company: &quot; His Hellenic Majesty&apos;s Fleet from Greek Commander-in-Chief&apos;s Orderof the Day after the Royal Decree of the 20th April.

(96)Prime Minister to General Paget.(OZ. 2127.  Personal and Top Secret.) 22nd April, 1944.1. Should it be found necessary to fire on the mutineers&apos; camp, considerwhether you should not begin with a few ranging shots on their batteries, whichare pointing at you. If they do not reply, you might give an interval and thenlet them have a stiffer dose, telling them at the time the; weight of fire which weare going to bring upon them if they persist. We are ready to use force to theutmost; but it would be better to avoid slaughter if possible. It is proposed thatthe blame shall fall on the British and not on the slender, tottering GreekGovernment. His Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to take this to theiraccount, as they have much more to give to the Greek nation than the Greeks canever give to us.2.   How is it that they are not already short of food ?.(97)Foreign Office to His Majesty&apos;&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo.(No. 173.   Personal and Secret.) 23rd April, 1944.Following from Prime Minister : -Your No. 266. I like all I hear of Papandreou. If you and the King think fit to advise him, you may count on us to support you. Mind you let us know in good time when you want the B.B.C. to say and me to tell Parliament if asked.(98)General Paget to C.T.G.S., repeated to General Wilson.(0/94667.  Personal and Top Secret.) 23r^ April, 1944.Your 88950/C.I.G.S. of 22nd April and my 0/94167, 21st April.Although loyal element Greek Navy carried out successful boarding operationnight 22nd/23rd April, I now intend to deal with Greek Brigades early to-morrowmorning, 24th April in view of : (i) Necessity for being prepared to deal with Egyptian situation, which may develop at any time,(ii) Deterioration of situation in other Greek units and regions (?) whichhave so far remained loyal.(99)General Paget to Prime Minister.(CIC/348.   Personal and Top Secret.) 23rd April, 1944.Thank you for your telegram OZ. 2127 of 22nd April.My plan is as you suggest. It will be necessary to capture two Greek postson high ground to start with in order to get close observation over camp. Thiswill be done just before dawn by Infantry only. As soon as it is light a smoke-screen will be put over camp for ten minutes. There will then be pause whilesmoke clears away and leaflets will be dropped on camp, stating that smoke will becontinued for further period of half hour, under cover of which all those who wishto do so should leave camp and come into our lines. If at the end of half hourmutineers are still holding out a few shells will be fired at one of the gun positionsfollowed by pause to allow of surrender. This process will be continued until allguns knocked out. If mutineers still refuse to surrender, it will be necessary toassault camp with infantry under cover of fire of tanks and artillery. Tanks willbe used in sniping role and will not go in to camp as mutineers are well supplied,with Piats and anti-tank guns. Brigade undoubtedly very short of food, but havebeen able to get some supplies from local Arabs. It has not been possible tocordon camp sufficiently closely to prevent this.
2i9A41(100)General Paget to Prime Minister.(CIC/349.   Personal and Top Secret.)   . 23rd April, 1944.Reference my telegram No. CIC/348 of 23rd April.Remainder of mutineers Greek ships surrendered evening 23rd April. Ihave, therefore, postponed use of force against one Greek Brigade for 24 hours in hopes that I can get Brigade to follow suit without bloodshed. I shall flyto Alexandria to-day to meet representatives of Brigade for this purpose. I feelthat serious consequences of use of force justify this delay in taking action. AlsoCi- Lord Killearn informs me that he has reason to hope that Egyptian political crisiswill not come to a head at present.(101)Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, to Admiralty, repeated to General Wilson.(Top Secret.) 23r^ April, 1944.The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East Forces, has issued an ultimatumexpiring at 1800C to-day, Sunday, to the mutinous Greek Brigade. If termsare not complied with they will be enforced by British troops early to-morrow,Monday.2. Although I would have preferred this action to be deferred until all three British services could act simultaneously or until the need for such action by one or more services had proved unnecessary, I have agreed to the Army going ahead in view of the special circumstances now obtaining in Egypt.3. I have the assurance of the Greek Naval Commander-in-Chief that hewill not allow this Army clash to affect his plans for finishing off the operationbegun last night.(T.O.O. 231136C)(102)Comrwander-in-Chief, Greek Navy, to General Ships and Establishments, R.H.N.,repeated His Majesty the King of Greece, Prime Minister of Greece, F.O.L.E.M.,Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean.(Confidential.) 23rd April, 1944.All mutinied ships of fleet in Alexandria have unconditionally surrendered to-day, Sunday, 23rd April, at 2000 hours. Mutinous element has been handedover to justice. Greek warships have returned to the path of honour and duty to their country.(T.O.O. 232109C)(103)His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to the Greek Government, Cairo, to Foreign Office.(No. 268.   Top Secret.) 24 A April, 1944.My telegram No. 266.Yesterday evening M. Venizelos visited me. The King of Greece had previously warned me he thought the object of the visit would be to discover my views about M. Papandreou.2. His Majesty&apos;s surmise was correct. M. Venizelos asked whether it was true that I had discussed with M. Papandreou a governmental programme forthe present emergency and whether I had reported this to London. I replied Ihad certainly listened to M. Papandreou&apos;s views and had reported what I thoughtwould be of interest.I presumed that M. Venizelos had likewise discussed the matter with this new arrival from Athens. Was he suggesting I should only report ideas for a programme which came from him?3. M. Venizelos said that so long as M. Papandreou was outside the Govern-ment he had no importance. He only represented a small party in Greece. I said I was not interested in parties but in getting leading Greeks together herein order to form a strong Government.4. I then told M. Venizelos, as he seemed to be asking for it and as I knew the King wished me to help him on this, that my own view was that the head of
the Greek Government at the time of the political conference should be somebodywho had just arrived from Greece so that he could speak with full authorityabout the state of feelings there.5. M. Venizelos, without any hesitation, and apparently without anyill-feeling, said he would at once send his resignation to the King in order tomake way for M. Papandreou. I said this was an unselfish and patrioticaction on his part and that I hoped he would continue to serve in theGovernment under the new Prime Minister; to this, however, he demurred, sayingthat he could be more useful if he attended the conference as a delegate of his party and not as a member of the Government. I asked him to reflect further on this.6. I immediately reported this conversation to the King, who later in the evening received M. Venizelos&apos;s resignation.7. I felt it necessary to push the matter in the right direction seeing the big part we are now playing in Greek affairs. I have no doubt M. Venizelos&apos;sfriends will criticise my action, but the main thing is to get the desired solutionwithout waste of time. Now that the mutinies are practically over, the changeof Government will come at the moment the King desired.8. May I, in conclusion, be permitted to pay a tribute to the handling ofthe mutinies by Commanders-in-Chief ? I am confident that this will make abig impression on the Greeks generally.(104)Prime Minister to General Paget.(OZ. 2152.   Top Secret and Personal.) 24*A April, 1944.Your CIC/348 of 23rd April.I approve your proposed course of action.(105)Prime Minister to General Paget.(OZ. 2161.
