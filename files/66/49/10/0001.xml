SECRET.D.P.M. (44) 14.7 th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.Committee on Preparations for Meeting with Dominion Prime Ministers,CO-OPERATION IN THE BRITISH commonwealth memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE question of the machinery of co-operation within the BritishCommonwealth has not been included as a separate item in the outline agendasent to the Dominion Prime Ministers, since it has been thought desirable to leave it to Mr. Curtin, who has been responsible for public statements on the subject,to raise the matter if he thinks fit. An opportunity would occur for this under item 4 of the agenda.The best available account of Mr. Curtin&apos;s suggestions is contained in an extract from a speech which he made at the Triennial Conference of theAustralian Labour Party in December 1943. A copy of this extract is annexed.It will be seen that the changes in the present system which Mr. Curtin proposesare two :  .....(a) The recognition of the Dominion High Commissioners in London and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs as a standing Sub-Committeeof the Imperial Conference.(b) The establishment of a joint permanent secretariat of the ImperialConference to be located normally in London, but to be an ambulatorybody.It is implicit in this statement, and clear from other statements which mr. Curtin and Dr. Evatt have made, that the essential objective which theyhave in mind is to secure for Australia a more effective voice in the framing ofpolicy. The emphasis is not on the need for a common policy but on ensuring that, so far as possible, the Australian view is listened to and accepted. Withthis object in mind, they wish to see that, at every level at which matters are discussed, there is an Australian there to present the Australian point of view.At the same time the whole system of co-operation is to be &quot; subject to the sovereign control of the policy of Australia by its own people, Parliament and government.&quot;Mr. Mackenzie King has made the Canadian position clear in answer indirectlyto Mr. Curtin, but directly in reply to Lord Halifax&apos;s recent speech at Toronto.Lord Halifax had emphasised the need for a common Empire foreign policy inorder to ensure that the members of the British Commonwealth might, by actingtogether, be able to exert their full influence in the post-war world, to a greaterdegree than could be exercised by the United, Kingdom or any other single memberacting independently.In reply to this, Mr. Mackenzie King said, in a speech in tjie CanadianHouse of Commons on the 31st January : &quot; We are certainly determined tosee the closest collaboration continue between Canada, the United Kingdom andother Commonwealth countries.....When, however, it comes to dealing withthe great issues which determine peace or war, prosperity or depression, it mustnot in aim or method be exclusive . . ... Our commitments on these great issuesmust be part of a general scheme, whether they be on a world basis or regionalin nature.^He also made it clear that, for his part, he was satisfied with the existing system of consultation and did not wish to see changes made.Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s objective is in a sense not dissimilar from that ofMr. Curtin in that he emphasises the need for control of Canadian policy bythe people of Canada, and for enabling*Canada to exercise an effective Canadianinfluence in world policy. He does not, however, consider that this can best beachieved by a close linking of Canada&apos;s policy with that of other members of
the British Commnwealth. His idea is that the best means of avoiding thepossibility of conflict between the United States and Russia is not by setting upa third great Power to hold the balance, but by linking all countries great and small together in a world-wide organisation. In such an organisation, Canadacould play a leading part among the smaller Powers, while at the same time,through her special links with the United States and with the United Kingdom,as a member of the British Commonwealth, Canada would be able to exert anindirect influence on the great Powers. His view is doubtless affected by theposition of Canada as an American nation, necessarily bound to take constantaccount of relations with the United States, and also by the fact that themajority of the Canadian population is not now of British origin or descent.The New Zealand Government has expressed no definite view in public,though they might reasonably be expected to support the Australian view, at least to the extent of being willing to co-operate in any closer formal organisation forattaining a joint Empire policy.Field-Marshal Smuts has emphasised, from the international point of view,the line of thought taken by Lord Halifax as to the need for another great Power,or rather co-operative body of States to counterbalance the two great Powers ofRussia and the United States. He would contemplate for this purpose a strengthening of links not only between the nations of the British Commonwealth,but also with other countries of North-Western Europe.The United Kingdom Government have been careful to refrain fromcommitting themselves to either side in this controversy. They have indicated that for their part they are ready to consider changes in machinery with a completely open mind, but that such changes must be approved by all concerned.As indicated above, it is assumed that Mr. Curtin will introduce this topicand will no doubt indicate the changes which he wishes to see made. It issuggested that the views of the other Prime Ministers should then be invited, andfrom what is said above, it is to be expected that Mr. Mackenzie King willindicate his objection to any form of closer formal organisation. No doubtMr. Eraser and Field-Marshal Smuts will also have views to express.It will then be for the United Kingdom Government to set out their views inthe light of the discussion. If, as seems likely, there is no general acceptance ofMr. Curtin&apos;s suggestions, it would be well to be prepared with some compromisesuggestions which, while not wholly unacceptable to Mr. Mackenzie King, might go some way to meet Mr. Curtin&apos;s points.One such proposal might be for a regular annual meeting of Ministers con-cerned with foreign policy. It has in the past and is-likely in the future to prove impracticable to arrange for a meeting of Prime Ministers more frequently than once in four years at best. This gap might usefully be filled in to some extent by a meeting of Foreign Ministers. If, as may perhaps be assumed, a world organisation is set up with regular annual meetings, corresponding roughly tothe Assembly of the League, the idea of exchanges of views between EmpireForeign Ministers, as a preliminary to such a general assembly might well com-mend itself to Australia, New Zealand and South Africa; and being on a purelyconsultative basis, might prove acceptable even to Canada. A technical difficultymight arise from the fact that at present in three of the four Dominions thePrime Minister himself is in charge of foreign affairs or &quot;external relations.&quot;But this system could hardly be continued in any event if there is to be an annualinternational gathering requiring his presence.An additional possibility is some kind of formalisation of the presentsystem of meetings between the Dominion High Commissioners in London and theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs. This is, in fact, included by Mr. Curtinas one of his proposals. It is open to certain objections, e.g., that DominionGovernments do not always make very appropriate selections of High Commis-sioners and also that High Commissioners are apt to lose touch with their own countries, or at any rate to be regarded in those countries as being out of touchwith local opinion. It may, moreover, be found that this proposal would go beyond what Mr. Mackenzie King is prepared to accept. Nevertheless, we should,I suggest, have it in mind, perhaps on a somewhat less formal basis than hasbeen suggested by Mr. Curtin, in case the course of the discussions seems toindicate that it would be generally acceptable.There remains Mr. Curtin&apos;s proposal that there should be established a joint permanent secretariat of the Imperial Conference. This proposal is not a newone. When it has been put forward on previous occasions it has failed to secure acceptance by the Dominion representatives on account of their suspicions thatit involved setting up centralised machinery for determining Empire policy. It[27299] B 2
seems likely, more especially in view of the present mood of Canadian publicopinion, that Mr. Mackenzie King would still regard any such proposal as unacceptable. It could, however, of course, be pointed out that the secretariatwould not be concerned with policy and would be no more than an office for theexchange and collation of information and for the preparation of agenda forconferences. Possibly this conception of its functions might reconcileMr. Mackenzie King to the idea, and there . is, of course, no reason why we ourselves should oppose any scheme which would make for closer machinery. Butif, as I expect, Mr. Curtin&apos;s proposals on this point are not generally acceptable,a possible modification of the idea, which might not be open to the same objectionsfrom the Canadian angle, would be for us to suggest that the Dominion Govern-ments should attach officials to their High Commissioners&apos; Offices with the function of maintaining close liaison with the Foreign Office, Cabinet Offices andthe Joint Planning Committee of the Chiefs of Staff. This would give them a chance of keeping in touch with defence and foreign policy during the formativestage. Australia has, in fact, already such officers, and similar facilities were offered to the other Dominions in 1942. But it might be worth while renewingthe offer, to continue into the post-Avar period. Some Dominion governments might accept; others might refuse. But we should, at any rate, have shown ourgoodwill, and uniformity is, in any case, not essential.I submit these suggestions for the consideration of my colleagues.(Initialled) C.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,7th April, 1944.ANNEX.Extract, from Mr. Curtin&apos;s Speech at the Triennial Conference of the AustralianLabour Party, 14 /t December, 1943.In my opinion, the following principles should govern consultations oncommon policy:  (1) The Australian and other Dominion Governments should have full knowledge of all essential facts, developments and trends of policy.(2) They should obtain this knowledge in time to express their views before decisions are taken.(3) They should have the opportunity through their accredited representa-tive, of presenting to and discussing with the War Cabinet, importantcommittees, the Prime Minister and other Ministers, any suggestions as to the new policy or views on the policy under consideration thatthe Government may from time to time desire to submit.The High Commissioners in London and the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should normally be a standing sub-committee of the Imperial conference to handle matters in the intervals when they cannot be dealt with by PrimeMinisters or Ministers. It should be presided over by the British PrimeMinister or his deputy. It would co-opt, where necessary, British Ministers,or Dominion Ministers visiting London.Corresponding to meetings of Prime Ministers, there should be meetings ofother Ministers as occasion may require, to deal with important/questions of mutual interest, such as trade and communications. Again, such conferencesneed not necessarily be held always in the one place. On occasions, the questionsmay only affect certain parts of the Empire.In addition to periodical meetings of Prime Ministers and Ministers, thereis also the permanent accredited representation of the Governments to each other in the form of High Commissioners. These constitute a continuous personal linkto supplement the direct correspondence between Governments. The high commissioners are also able to represent their Governments on bodies created forthe consideration of special aspects of Empire interests and relations. an illustration is the Committee of Imperial Defence, which is usually presided overby the British Prime Minister. On a lower plane are the staffs of High Commis-sioners, who should be regularly rotated with other members of the services ofthe part of the Empire from which they are drawn. This arrangement should be supplemented by attachments and exchanges between the staffs of corresponding
departments throughout the Empire. Dominion officers serving in London can beused by the accredited representative of the Government as a valuable adjunct inliaison with British departments.Of primary importance-on the staff level is the secretariat of the ImperialConference. This would normally be located in London, but it would be anambulatory body, and function for conferences at the place of meeting. AllDominions would be represented on the secretariat. It would be responsible forseeing to the preparation and presentation of information on subjects to beconsidered by the conference from time to time. It would follow up the decisionsof the conference in regard to the completion of action or re-submissions to the% conference. It would provide the conference with an agency for continuity inits detailed work, which is important, in view of changes which occur in Govern-ments and Prime Ministers. The secretariat would not supersede the presentestablished direct channels of communication between Governments, though its members would be directly responsible to their respective Prime Ministers.Outside the scope of Governmental machinery, great benefits are to beobtained by regular visits between representatives of Parliamentary Associations,the press, trade unions, cultural, professional and commercial organisations.o
