PART I. ALLIED NAVAL CONTINGENTS.French Navy.Reference was made in the last Quarterly Report* to the progress beingmade by the former North African and Free French factions in &quot;gettingtogether.&quot; Further information on this matter is not very encouraging., and themost that can &quot;be said is that each side is content more or less to ignore the othersocially, but would probably not allow their feelings to interfere with any opera-tions on which they might be mutually engaged.2 Three of the former Free French Corvettes, at the request of the naval staff in Algiers, recently visited Casablanca. Officers and men had lookedforward to these visits and finding themselves once again in French surroundings,but they were received so coldly that they were glad when the time came to leave.3. The Richelieu, after about four months with the Home Fleet, visitedRosyth in order to give short leave. In the middle of March she proceeded, byway of Algiers, to join the Eastern Fleet.Success.4. The S/M Casabianca sank a 1,000-ton A/S vessel and scored a hit on a4,000-ton Merchant Ship while on patrol off Toulon at the end of December.Operations.5. The Cruiser Gloire has taken part in the bombardment of the Italiancoast. Other Cruisers have been employed, both in the Atlantic and mediterranean.6. The Fantasque and Malin took part in the operations at Anzio. TheMalin and TerriMe carried out a successful action in the Northern Adriatic onthe 29th February. Two Merchant Vessels, one Escort and two E-Boats were sunk.7.   The S/M Rubis has completed further successful minelaying patrols.Allocation and Commissioning of Ships.8. Of the remaining three &quot; River &quot; Class Frigates, two have now completed their working-up and are attached to Western Approaches. The thirdcommissioned on the 9th March and is due for acceptance trials on the 3rd April.9 The ex-Italian S/M Bronzo has been taken over in the mediterranean and renamed Narval.10. The first three of the six Destroyer Escorts, allocated by the UnitedStates, have now been commissioned as Senegalais, Algerien and Tunisien.11. The S/M Vineyard is to be manned on completion. She will take theplace of Minerve, which was damaged by Allied aircraft, and is not to be refittedat present.12. It has been decided to allocate a further four Corvettes and twoFrigates, but the actual ships have not yet been selected. Although the french have plenty of ratings available, numerically, in North Africa, they appear to lackspecialists in many categories and, the fact that it is not intended to hand these ships over to them before the second half of the year, suits their manningsituation.13; On request of the French Naval Staff it has been agreed to return theCapricieuse to the French, and a crew is at present being formed to man her. Ithas been found necessary to bring some officers and specialist ratings from north africa.14. Twelve French Minesweepers, at present manned by R.N.P.S. crews, areto be taken over by the French in the United Kingdom, but here again, owing to shortage of specialist ratings, particularly electricians, only six can be manned inthe near future. Two crews are at present under training, and the first vessel isto be commissioned early in April.[27340]* CCS. (44) 6.
15. Eight British Motor Minesweepers are to be taken over in the,Mediterranean.Loss.16. The S/M protection was lost while on patrol off Toulon at the end ofDecember.Refit.17.   Refits completed in the United States comprise Sloops. Submarines.Dumont d&apos;Urville. Amazone.La Grandiere. Antiope.Chevreuil. A cargo.Glorieux.18. The three 8-inch Cruisers, Duquesne, Suffren and Tourville are allapproaching the time when they will require refitting if they are to be kept in service. It has been decided that the pressure of work in the United Kingdomand United States yards will not permit this in the near future, and it isintended that they should be kept running as long as possible on French resources and then laid up.19. The Ouragan, V Incomprise, and la Melpomene, are to be laid up, as there is now no useful employment for them in their present state and their refitscannot be undertaken.20. The French have also agreed to La Flore and Mistral being laid upwhenever the Admiralty may decide that the time has come to pay them off.21. All these ships, together with A was and Epinal (laid up at Portsmouth),will be placed under the orders.of Flag Officer Commanding, Reserve Fleet, andlaid up at Hartlepool with a French Care and Maintenance party.Polish Navy.22. The Soviet-Polish situation continues to cause anxiety and unrest inthe Fleet. It must not be forgotten that of the 3,000 men in the Polish Navy,800 were prisoners of war in Russia eighteen months ago. These men all came from homes situated East of the Curzon Line, and the proportion of men inthe Fleet, therefore, who would find themselves Russian, if the Curzon Linebeoame the frontier, is high.23. The Polish Admiral, on General Sosnknowski&apos;s instructions, has causedit to be known that anything in the nature of a demonstration would be&apos;&apos; suicidal&apos;&apos; to the Polish interest in the long run, and for the moment it may besaid that the co-operation of the Fleet with ourselves is unimpaired.24. The Dragon completed work-up and joined the Home Fleet, but is toproceed to Chatham to effect certain changes in the A./A. armament.25. The Krakowiak and Slazak are still operating in the Mediterraneanbut are expected to return to the United Kingdom shortly.26. The Piorun took part in the bombardment of the Italian coast in theSalerno area.   She has now returned to this country.27. The S/M Dzik carried out a successful patrol in the ^aegean during january, sinking a 6,000-ton Merchant Ship.28. The&quot; Sokol is back in this country after nearly a year in the Mediter-ranean and the Dzik is due very shortly.29. The Polish Naval Staff, having expressed a wish to pay off the destroyer Burza, in order to ease their manning situation and enable moretraining to be carried out, it has been decided to reduce her to care andmaintenance.   Her refit, which was due, has been deferred.30. The Blyskawica was in collision with the Musketeer and is now under-going repairs. - -
Royal Netherlands Navy.31. The Gunboats Flores and Soemba, having been so much engaged inthe bombardment of the Italian coast, it was found necessary to bring them backto this country for the renewal of their guns, which had become worn out. the guns of the Sumatra are being used for this purpose.32. H.M. The Queen of the Netherlands inspected these ships on their arrival at Portsmouth.Ships Commissioned and Paid Off. .33. One more Motor Minesweeper has been commissioned and two more arecompleting. In order to provide the necessary crews four old Minesweepers havebeen paid off. The Dutch are to take over the remaining five M.T.B&apos;s of theSecond Flotilla at Dover. When this has been carried out they will be manningtwo complete Flotillas at that Port.Submarines.34. 0.24 is at present refitting in the United States and 0.21, which it hadbeen intended to refit in this country, is also to proceed to the United Statesowing to the difficulty in finding a yard for her.35. It had been intended that the Zeehond should be stationed at Bermudafor A/S duties, but it has now been decided to keep her in Home waters. TheDutch Authorities have asked the Admiralty for a new construction S/M in theplace of Zeehond, and this matter is now under consideration.Depot Ship.36. The Orange Nassau, which has been stationed at Holyhead since coming to this country, has been moved to the Thames.Royal Norwegian Navy.Successes.37. The Destroyer Stord is credited with the destruction of the S/M whichhad torpedoed the Hardy on the 30th January.38. The S/M TJla, on patrol off Southern Norway on the 20th February,attacked a convoy of eight Merchant Ships. Two explosions were heard, and later it was observed that a search was being made. Five days later, in the same area, she attacked a 2,000-ton Merchant Ship. Two explosions were heard and four minutes later the target had disappeared.39. The-M.T.B&apos;s operating from Lerwick have carried out successfulpatrols off the Norwegian coast. One patrol vessel was left on fire and two merchant Ships of 1,400 and 600 tons were sunk.Loss.40. M.L. 210 was sunk, and M.L. 573 was damaged, when minelaying inthe Channel on February 15th. The Commanding Officer, one officer and threeratings of M.L. 210 were killed and ten of the crew were injured.Ships Commissioned.41. The Destroyer Shark, renamed Svenner, was commissioned on the8th March.42. In order to provide the crew for this ship, and also on account of theirage and-limited usefulness, the Town Class Destroyers Lincoln and St. Albanswere paid off. . &quot; ;43.   The S/M Variance, now building, has been allocated to the Norwegians.44. The Frigate Shrewsbury Castle has been allocated to take the placeof the Corvette Potentilla, which has been returned to the Royal Navy.
Change of Base.45. The 54th M.T.B. Flotilla, which has been based at Lerwick, has been moved to Great Yarmouth. During their time at Lerwick the boats of thisFlotilla have done much good work off the Norwegian coast and their ships&apos;companies have proved themselves keen and efficient.Royal Navy (Section Beige).46. Two more Motor Minesweepers were manned by Belgian crews onthe 1st February, making six of these craft now in service and a total of tenvessels manned by Belgian crews.47. At present there are 70 Belgian officers and 385 Belgian ratings in theRoyal Navy.48. Due mainly to the demands of the Belgian Army, no further manningcommitments are at present in contemplation.Royal Hellenic Navy.Allocation of Ships.49. After the last of these reports was rendered on the 1st January an alteration was made in the renaming of the Destroyers Avonvale and Cowdray.These are now called JEgean and Admiral Hastings respectively, instead of theother way round. Echo was allocated in place of Arrow and has been renamedNavarinon.50. The refits of the JEgean and Admiral Hastings have been delayed, andthe expected dates of completion are at present mid-April and end of June. Thelong time which the crews are spending at the R.N. Barracks, Chatham, with little to keep them occupied, is having, as must be expected, a certain effect on theirmorale, although they appreciate the necessity of priority for other work atpresent.51.   The Salamis has proceeded to Scapa for her working-up.52. The Corvettes Kriezis and Tombazis, having completed theirworking-up, have been employed on Convoy Escort in Western Approaches.Loss.53.   L.S.T. 37 (Lesbos) was lost by grounding in the Mediterranean.54. The Destroyer Kanaris was in collision with Hawkins on the19th March. She got back under her own power to Alexandria and will be repaired locally.Royal Yugoslav Navy.55. The working-up of the Corvette Nada was not satisfactorily accom-plished in the United Kingdom. Only a very moderate degree of efficiency wasreached, and, just when it had been decided that no further purpose would be served by keeping her here any longer, about 30 per cent, of the crew declaredthemselves for Marshal Tito and left the ship. In accordance with the generalpolicy which had been adopted on this question in the Mediterranean, it wasdecided that these men should not be treated as deserters or offenders, and theywere segregated from other Yugoslavs by being sent to R.N. Barracks,Portsmouth, thence to be sent out to Malta.56. The Nada, being thus so short of complement, she was sent out to theMediterranean in Convoy instead of as a Convoy Escort. She is proceeding to malta so that her crew can be made up to strength again, and it is intended that,after a further period of working-up, she should operate from Gibraltar.57. The manning of further Yugoslav ships in the Mediterranean is stillcomplicated by the existence of the two factions, Royalist and Partisan, and theactual disposition of these forces cannot yet be stated.
Danish Section of the Royal Navy.58. The rate of recruitment into the Danish Section has been very slow; infact, it has been almost at a standstill.59. There are now in the British Naval Service 13 Danish officers and just over 80 ratings.60. Two Motor Minesweepers were manned on the 1st March, and it ishoped to be able to man another pair in the course of the next two months.mPART II.-ALLIED ARMY CONTINGENTS.French Forces.61. The two French parachute battalions now form part of a British S.A.S.Brigade at present stationed in Scotland. These battalions are now mobilising.Both battalions&apos; are making good progress in their training, but their standardof administration and attention to detail as judged by British standards, althoughslowly improving, are still weak. The morale of all ranks is high and theydisplay enthusiasm for their operational role.62. Difficulties, have arisen with.the French National Committee over theprovision of reinforcements for these battalions. Adequate numbers have been dispatched from North Africa, but a considerable number of rejections havebeen necessary on physical grounds. The battalions are practically up to strengthbut deficient in signals and other specialists.63. The French are training a number of Liaison Officers to work with british and American Field Force Units in operations overseas. At present there are understood to be 157 officers already trained, out of- a French ceilingfigure of 250. The eventual number will be settled as soon as estimates of require-ments have been received from British and American Army Groups.64. Changes have been made in the French Mission in London which will result in the replacement of Generals d&apos;Astier de la Vigerie and Mathenet byGeneral Koenig, whose name is associated with Bir Hakeim; The duties ofGeneral dAstier de la Vigerie and Mathenet were not clearly defined and it hasbeen difficult to determine their respective responsibilities. It is to be hopedthat General Koenig will be charged with full responsibilities.65. 20 Military Mission in United Kingdom has been disbanded, and infuture their responsibilities will be shared between MIL (War Office) and european Allied Contact Section, SHAEF.Polish Forces.66. General Sosnkowski is in Italy on a visit to the Polish Corps (fromMiddle East) now operating in the Eighth Army.67. The Polish Commando troop has distinguished itself in operations in italy and isvremaining there for the present.68. During the last few months parties of Polish Jewish soldiers from theArmd. Div. have deserted and come to London. The total numbers amount tosome 200. Unrest amongst the Jews is organised and supported by British and polish Jewish. organisations in London and has the sympathy of some JewishMembers of the House of Commons. There is possibly Russian influence behind the unrest. The deserters were induced to return to Scotland with a view totransfer to the British Pioneer Corps. No further transfers will be permittedand disciplinary action has been taken against the most recent Jewish deserters,which it is hoped will prevent further trouble. The Polish Unit cannot afford to lose trained and fit men.69. 1 Polish Armd. Div. is now mobilising and will move to Yorkshire for final training provided the Division is brought up to strength with first reinforce-ments:   To bring the Division up to strength will necessitate transferring the
necessary men from the Cadre formations and Schools. The Polish Authoritiesare reluctant to do this. But it has been made clear to them that failure to doso will mean the exclusion of the Division from 21 Army Group and from opera-tions in North-West Europe.70. Negotiations for the employment of the Polish Parachute Brigade,which is composed of fine fighting material, in operations in France are inprogress.  In the west, the Brigade has been reserved for operations in Poland.Dutch Forces.71. The Princess Irene Bde. has had good opportunity for training in theFrinton Area. Proposals have been put forward for some minor changes in their organisation; and it is expected that they will shortly receive reinforcements in the form of 100 Dutch Marines from the United States.72. The Bde. is moving back to Harwich early in April where it will complete its mobilisation.73. The Bde. was recently inspected by General Montgomery, and the morale and keenness of the Bde. has been raised to a high level as a result.Norwegian Forces.74. Planning between the Scottish Command and Norwegian Staffs for operations in Norway has been proceeding for some months and has reached an advanced stage.75. The Norwegian Bde. has been carrying out snow exercises with 52 Div.Unfortunately owing to operational requirements in Italy it was found impossibleto issue the latest snow equipment to the contingent in time for them to use it on this exercise. It was, however, made clear to them that this failure wasnot in any way due to their being second priority to 52 Div., and that they might hope to get the equipment as hoped in April.Belgian Forces.76. The Belgian 1st Group has been doing useful training with 61 Div.in Kent and is showing satisfactory progress.77.   Mobilisation is now in progress.78. Proposals are under consideration for forming a medical unit basedon a Light Field Ambulance.79. The Belgian Para. Coy. has joined the British S.A.S. Bde. in Ayrshirewhere it has done active training and is now mobilising. This Company isreported to be in all respects above the average standard of British ParachuteCoys.80. The Belgian Commando has distinguished itself in operations in Italyand is remaining in that country for the present.Czechoslovak Forces.81. The Czech Independent Armd. Bde. Gp. is making good progress inits training and will be moving to Yorkshire for advanced training in the nearfuture. The Bde. is being equipped with Cromwell tanks and a number of them have recently been delivered, causing considerable satisfaction to the Czechs, whosemorale is high.82. Approximately 150 Czech officers are being sent to Russia to replacecasualties and to assist in the formation of new units/ Many of these officers are surplus to establishment, and not only will the Independent Armd.Bde. Gp. not suffer from the loss of these officers, but, on the contrary, it is expectedthat efficiency will improve as a result of the commissioning of good cadets toreplace any posted officers who may be withdrawn.
83. In Scottish Command exercise &quot; Snow-Shoe,&quot; British Units were placed under command of Norwegian Bde. However, since the exercise there has beena change in the Commander of the Bde., Colonel Just taking over from ColonelHolterman.84. War Establishments for an operational Bde. Hq., which will be includedin and when necessary thrown off from the present somewhat unwieldy Bde. Hq.,have been agreed. The question of a Signals Section is still under considerationby Norwegian and Scottish Commands.85. The Norwegian Para. Coy. has done useful work, acting as ski-inginstructors to 52 Div.86. Two advanced Parachute courses of one week&apos;s duration each have beenarranged for the beginning of April, after which they will return to their presentlocation in Scotland.General.87. A statement showing the strength, organisation and location of AlliedContingents in the United Kingdom is attached at Appendix II.PART III.-ALLIED AIR CONTINGENTS.General Note on Morale.88. Although morale in the Allied Air Forces has on the whole remainedhigh, certain criticisms are contained in paragraphs 101, 102, 120, 161 and 163.French Air Forces.Armee de VAir.General.89. M. le Troquer, until recently the French Minister for War andAir, and General Bouscat, Commander-in-chief of the French Air Force,expressed a wish to visit the United Kingdom to discuss French participation in allied Military Councils connected with Second Front operations, the employmentof the French Air Force in these operations, and air matters generally whichmight arise in French territory liberated by the Allies. As all these questions were embraced in a Draft Agreement between the British and United states government and the French Committee of National Liberation, the Air Ministrycould not agree to discuss these matters, although they would have welcomed sucha visit, if confined to inspections of the French Air Force in the United Kingdomand to discussion as to its training and welfare.  The visit was not made.90. The French Committee of National Liberation has established an AirMission in London headed by General Valin with General Jacquin as Deputy,to study questions connected with setting up eventually a Territorial AirCommand in France to reorganise the French air force, aircraft industry, air bases and air transport. This Mission has not yet been officially recognised as its duties appear to overlap those of General d&apos;Astier de la Vigerie&apos;s and GeneralMathenet&apos;s Missions.91. The London Headquarters of the French Air Force has been strengthened particularly by the appointment of General Jacquin as Deputy toGeneral Valin and of Colonel Bodet as an additional Chief of Staff.Progress of Development in the United Kingdom.92. The personnel of the two Day Fighter Squadrons, referred to in para-graph 90 of the 27th Report, arrived from North Africa in January and wereformed at R.A.F. Station, Ayr, in A.D.G.B. as Nos. 329 and 345 (French)Squadrons on the 3rd and 30th January, 1944, respectively.93.   On the 2nd February, No. 329 Squadron, the pilots of-which had by then completed a short O.T.U. course, joined Nos. 340 and 341 (French) Squadrons[27340] c
at R A.F. Station, Perranporth, in order to form with them a French FighterWing that could be transferred to the 2nd Tactical Air Force for impendingSecond Front operations.   The three squadrons have already operated as a wing.94. With a view to the early transfer of this French Wing to the 2ndTactical Air Force, No. 145 (French) Airfield Headquarters was formed atPerranporth on the 20th January, mainly with French personnel of the ServicingEchelons of the three squadrons. Unfortunately, it was found impossible to make this Airfield Headquarters fully efficient and mobile, in the short time available,with a body of Frenchmen whose knowledge of the English language and ofR.A.F. procedure was small, and in whose ranks was a large number of seniorN.C.Os. possessing only a low R.A.F. trade classification.95. In order not to deprive the Flying Echelons of the opportunity to take part in impending operations, on which General de Gaulle has been so insistent,immediate and drastic action had to be taken to make the airfield efficient bythe target date, and accordingly all French non-flying personnel, except a smalltoken body of about fifty, were posted away and their places taken by R.A.F.personnel. The future employment of approximately 350 Frenchmen so with-drawn (and now accommodated in the French Camp at Camberley), has not yetbeen decided, but every effort will be made to maintain their morale and fit themto play their proper part. Personnel of the regular French Air Force now coming to this country, owing partly to the great difference between French andBritish service customs and methods and standards of training are less ablethan are other Allies to accommodate themselves to R.A.F. practice. It oftentakes time as well as patience and tact to discover a modus vivendi.96. No. 345 Squadron is still at Ayr, while the pilots are completingoperational training.   It should shortly be ready for operations.97. The first of the two French Heavy Bomber Squadrons referred to inparagraph 89 of the 27th Report is now expected to form on the 15th May andthe second a month later. The target of twelve French Squadrons in the R.A.F.Target Force will then have been reached.Operations (United Kingdom).98. Nos. 340 and 341 Day Fighter Squadrons in the A.E.A.F. have flownover 1,300 hours on operations and No. 329 Day Fighter Squadron two hours,one enemy aircraft being destroyed, three probably destroyed and three damaged.No. 342 Light Bomber Squadron in the 2nd T.A.F. has continued to makesuccessful low-level attacks on France, making 448 sorties.Operations (Overseas).99. Nos. 326, 327 and 328 Squadrons have flown 3,058 hours on operations.The destruction of one enemy aircraft being credited to the first Squadron;From the time the Squadrons joined the M.A.C.A.F. up to the 20th December,1943, these Squadrons have been credited with 25 enemy aircraft destroyed&quot;9 probably destroyed and 12 damaged.100. There is nothing of interest to report about the French SquadronsOverseas which are sponsored by the R.A.F. but outside the R.A.F. Target Force.Morale.101. In the United Kingdom morale in No. 342 Light Bomber Squadrontends to vary from day to day, but has, on the whole, been good. Although inNos. 340 and 341 Squadrons morale has been very good, at the close of the periodit fell considerably and that in No. 329, the third Squadron at R.A.F. Station,Perranporth, is low. The pilots appear to think that the R.A.F. Group andStation Commanders and staffs are not well disposed towards the French andthe appointment of a British officer to lead the French Wing and the with-draw-al of French personnel from the Airfield Headquarters have also, for. thetime being, had a depressing effect.102. Amongst Frenchmen in training in the United Kingdom there is some impatience at the long training insisted upon by the R.A.F. and many donot appreciate the necessity.103. M.A.C.A.F. report that morale in the three Target Force DayFighter Squadron is &quot; good to very good&quot; and in French units outside this force,on average, good.
Supplies.104. Supplies and services furnished to the French Air Force throughE.A.F. channels are now covered by the Mutual Aid Protocol signed on the8th February, 1944.105. Five Oxford Ambulance Aircraft were despatched to french equatorial Africa, and five Wellington transport aircraft will shortly be sentto the same destination. Approval has also been given to the supply of fiftyTiger-Moths for use by the French Air Force in their Eefresher School atKasba-Tadla.Records.106. A R.A.F. (French) Record Office was formed in London on the1st January, 1944, to keep the records of the French Air Force and Naval air arm personnel in the United Kingdom and to raise their R.A.F. documents.Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services.107. The Air Ministry has assumed responsibility for the kitting andtraining of the Auxiliaires Feminins Militaires de 1&apos;Air (French W.A.A.F.)which used to be a section of the French A.T.S. under the administration of theWar Office.Aeronautique Navale.108. On the recommendation of the United States Chiefs of Staff, the combined Chiefs of Staff have agreed to form three additional French naval air Arm Squadrons in North-West Africa. It is very doubtful whether theFrench Naval Air Arm has sufficient personnel to man and support these squadrons without encroaching upon the reserves that they have agreed to keepfor the maintenance of the two Coastal Squadrons operating with the RAP.109. Nos. 343 (Sunderland) Squadron and 344 (Wellington) Squadronmade respectively 112 and 199 sorties from bases at Dakar. They shared with one British Sunderland Squadron the task of ensuring the safety of shippingalong 1,000 miles of coastline northwards from Freetown.110. Three attacks were made on enemy submarines, no damage beingreported in the first two. Reports on the third attack are not yet available.During January these squadrons were credited with two probable &quot; kills &quot;following attacks-on U-boats in the latter part of 1943.111. Morale in both squadrons is excellent. The A.O.C., West Africa,reports that both squadrons are efficiently organised, operationally andadministratively, and training is adequate and well-run. The standard, he says, is at least up to that of similar British squadrons. Some difficulties havebeen experienced in introducing British maintenance procedure, but the positionis improving. Individually, the French mechanics are more skilled and experienced than is generally the case with R.A.F. personnel.112. No. 343;Squadron is still unable to carry out its own major inspectionsand strong pressure has been brought on the French Naval Headquarters tosupply the skilled personnel necessary for this duty.Polish Air Force.Operations.113. In Bomber Command one flight of No. 300 Squadron was engaged upto the 8th March on mine-laying operations. 124 sorties were made and in twentyoperations 237 mines were laid in three &quot;gardens&quot; in enemy waters, wherereports show that a high rate of sinkings resulted. In January the squadron&apos;ssorties were 98 - 2 per cent, effective, which is a record in Bomber Command. Thesecond flight has during the period been converting to Lancaster aircraft and thefirst flight has now started to do the same.114.   In A.D.G.B. three Day-Fighter Squadrons and one Night-fighter squadron flew 634 hours on offensive sweeps by day (and the&quot; Night-fighter squadron 22 hours by night), during which two enemy aircraft were destroyed.[27340]       ^ c, 9
115. In 2nd Tactical Air Force five Day-Fighter Squadrons have flown sincethe 21st December, 1943, over 3,930 hours on operations (2,283 sorties), destroyingduring the period since the 20th December, 1943, one enemy aircraft. No. 305Light Bomber Squadron has made 76 sorties, but is not yet up to the standardof other Mosquito Squadrons in the Group, and this is due largely to frequentchanges in equipment and the fact that the pilots are finding their work on lightaircraft strange after that on Wellingtons and Mitchells. The Squadron,though operational by day, has yet to prove itself fit for night operations onMosquitoes.116. In Coastal Command No. 304 Squadron made 240 sorties, duringwhich six attacks were delivered on enemy submarines. The Squadron hasmaintained a consistently high operational standard and in February wascongratulated by the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief.117. In Transport Command ninety-six Polish aircrew personnel who havebeen engaged in transport and ferrying duties are reported to have shown a finespirit.118. In Balloon Command the Polish Flight continue to give very satisfac-tory service.No. 318 (F.R.) Squadron.119. This Squadron has now completed its training in the Middle East andis shortly to be transferred to Italy for active operations.Morale.120. In Squadrons in Bomber and Coastal Commands morale remains highand it is good also in the Fighter Squadrons in A.E.A.F. In No. 305 squadron in 2nd T.A.F. it is less good, owing to the difficulties referred to above and to atemporary shortage of trained reserve aircrews. The fighting spirit, however, ofthe individual members of the crews leaves nothing to be desired.121. In the Middle East (No. 318 Squadron) and amongst Poles in transport and Balloon Commands morale and discipline have been good.Re-equipment.122. The conversion of the first flight of No. 300 Squadron from Wellingtonto Lancaster aircraft, referred to in paragraph 118 of the 27th Report, wasimpeded by the necessity of sending during February six of the crews to theM.A.A.F. to strengthen No. 1586 Polish S.D. (O) Flight, but, now itselfreinforced, the flight should be ready for operations early in April. The secondflight is also being converted to Lancaster aircraft.Transport Pool.123. P.A.F. Transport Pool, consisting of Liaison Officers, Aircrews,Servicing Section and Staff Pool, is in course of formation in Transport command for the purpose of training Polish personnel in the organisation, administration and operation of air transport. They will be employed within transport command at the discretion of the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief. The Poolwill be built up gradually as and when personnel and aircrews are found to besurplus to the requirements of Polish commitments in other Commands. the target establishment will probably be fixed at about fifty crews with administra-tive staff and a small cadre of technicians. A considerable time must elapse before this target can be reached.Special Duty Flight.124. Six additional crews with six Halifax aircraft were despatched toNo. 1586 (Polish) S.D. (O) Flight in M.A.A.F. during February, bringing its strength in aircraft up to nine Halifax and three Liberators. The Establish-ment is to be reviewed in May 1944.Reorganisation.125. Two of the four Type C Mobile Signals Units included in the sevenunits referred to in paragraph 119 of the 27th Report are not now to be manned by Poles.  This leaves the P.A.F. with five Mobile Signals Units.
Recruiting and Man-power.126. Eighteen officers and 157 other ranks from the Polish Land Army inthe Middle East have arrived in the United Kingdom for aircrew training, and198 other ranks for training in aircraft maintenance. The number for aircrewis sufficient for immediate needs, but still more recruits are required for groundduties.Royal Dutch Naval Air Service.Operations.fi- 127.   No. 320 Squadron has been engaged against military targets inNorthern France, making 480 sorties in the quarter (plus twelve in the first threeweeks of December, not already reported). Of twelve targets attacked by twoMitchell Squadrons (one R.A.F. and No. 320 Squadron, the Dutch leading),representing 20 per cent, of all targets saturated by the Group, were so effectuallydealt with that for the time being further attacks were unneccessary.No. 321 Squadron.128. No reports have been received of the operations of this Double CatalinaSquadron based on Ceylon. The difficulty of providing replacement crews referredto in paragraph 128 of the 27th Report remains, although there is every likelihood that a nucleus (two pilots, one navigator B, one W/O AG. and one A.G.) will be despatched from the United Kingdom every third month.Morale in the United Kingdom.129. A Dutch officer has again assumed command of No. 320 squadron and he appears to be consolidating the improvement in morale effected by theR.A.F. officer who was in command for a short period (see paragraph 127 of the27th Report); it is now certainly satisfactory.130. Morale is high among the few Dutch aircrew personnel serving in transport Command.Post Hostilities Planning.131. A Combined, Dutch Navy and Army Committee has been formed to plan and co-ordinate the expansion of the Dutch Air Force for the war against japan after the defeat of Germany, and the Air Ministry is giving the Committeesuch assistance as is possible in the formation of its plans.Royal Dutch Army Aviation (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations and Morale.132. No. 322 Day Fighter Squadron flew 594 hours on operations. Itsmorale has been good and sometimes excellent. Its Servicing Echelon has beenabsorbed into No. 147 (British : 3 Squadron) Airfield Headquarters in No. 85(Base) Group.Recruiting.  .133. General recruiting of both flying and maintenance personnel continuesto be spasmodic and all too small. For service when trained with the R.D.N.A.S.a number of Dutch Naval Ratings and Merchant Navy seamen have been secured,for training as Wireless Operator/Air Gunners and Air Gunners.Royal Norwegian Air Force.Operations.134. In the 2nd Tactical Air Force Nos. 331 and 332 Day Fighter Squadronshave since the 1st December, 1943, flown over 1,480 hours on operations destroyingsix enemy aircraft, probably destroying, one and damaging one.135. In Coastal Command. No. 330 (Sunderland) Squadron made 59 sortiesfrom Sollum Voe oh routine anti-submarine patrol and convoy escort duty with87 per cent, effectiveness. The Mosquito Flight of No. 333 Squadron made56 sorties on ship, reconnaissance along the Norwegian coast, destroying three
enemy aircraft, and the Catalina Flight made 15 sorties, mainly on anti-submarinepatrol, convoy escort and special duties.Recruiting.136. Still fewer recruits have been forthcoming although there has been asmall trickle from Sweden. There is some prospect of obtaining increasednumbers from this source.Morale.137. Morale is reported to be good in all Norwegian Squadrons and in theBeaufighter Squadrons it is described, as high and even excellent. It is also highamongst some forty Norwegians serving in Transport Command.General.138. The R.N.A.F. Headquarters have asked for No. 330 Squadron to be equipped with Beaufighter (torpedo-bomber) aircraft, but it is not at presentpossible to do this, there is still great difficulty in finding replacement crews (tenmembers) for this squadron.The Belgian Air Force (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations and Morale.139. In A.E.A.F. Nos. 349 and 350 Day Fighter Squadrons have flown on operations 815 and 82 hours respectively with A.D.G.B., and No. 349 Squadron36 hours with 2nd T.A.F.140.   Two enemy aircraft were destroyed.   Morale has been very high.141. Eight enemy aircraft were also destroyed by Belgian pilots serving inR.A.F. Squadrons.142.   Morale amongst 10 Belgians serving in Transport Command is good.Recruiting.143. Thirty-six officers have been commissioned and 150 airmen enlisted inthe R.A.F.V.R. (Belgian Section). Recruits for the Belgian Armed Forcescontinue to reach United Kingdom from enemy-occupied Europe, but theproportion allotted by the Belgian Ministry of National Defence to their AirForce, especially of potential aircrew personnel, appears to have been reduced.Inspectorate-General.144. An Inspectorate-General of the Belgian Air Force has been set up, and colonel L. F. E. Wouters, C.B.E., M.C., has been appointed Inspector-general with the rank of Air Commodore, R.A.F.V.R. He has relinquished his appoint-ment of Belgian Military and Air Attache to His Majesty&apos;s Government, whichhe has held for eight years.Meteorological Branch.145. Approval is being sought for the establishment, within the R.A.F.Meteorological Branch, of a Belgian Meteorological Section to be the nucleus of a service which can be expanded rapidly when the Allies invade the Continent, andin addition to assist the Authorities in the Belgian Congo to develop Meteoro-logical facilities for air routes in Central Africa.146. Already during 1942 and 1943 16 Belgian Officers and airmen were transferred to the R.A.F. Meteorological Branch for training as forecasters andassistants. Three Officers and 3 other ranks will shortly -be seconded to theBelgian Ministry of Colonies. They will proceed to Stanleyville and open aMeteorological Office there. A network of Reporting Stations in the belgian congo is being developed.Visits.148. M. Pierlot, the Belgian Prime Minister and Minister of NationalDefence, apart from visiting the RAF. Belgian Initial Training School, where he expressed himself as satisfied with the organisation and progress, attended aBelgian parade at a R.A.F. Operational Station in February and decorated theBelgian flag with the Croix de Guerre to commemorate the destruction of 100enemy aircraft by Belgian pilots.
148. It will be noted that in Appendix No. IV this claim is not reflected, butthe figures in this Appendix of enemy aircraft destroyed are essentiallyconservative, and adjustments are made from time to time after the records of claims have been thoroughly scrutinised. The accuracy of the Belgian claim isnot disputed.Czechoslovak Air Force (R.A.F.Y.R.).Operations.149. In A.E.A.F. Nos. 310, 312 and 313 Day Fighter Squadrons have flown1,188 hours on operations with A.D.G.B. and 1,599 hours with the 2nd T.A.F.150. When 20 Czechsiovak volunteer pilots were sent to Russia in February(see para. 147 of the 27th Report) it was feared that No. 313 Squadron, theground staff of which was R.A.F., would have to be disbanded. The CzechoslovakInspector-General, however, pleaded that this Squadron should be allowed toremain as a Czech Unit, and this has been agreed. Should abnormalcasualties be suffered, British pilots will have to be posted to this Unit.151. In Coastal Command, No. 311 (Liberator) Squadron made 115 sorties.The following engagements are worthy of mention.152. On the 24th December the German blockade runner Alsterufer was attacked by one aircraft, in face of concentrated flak, and struck by four rocketprojectiles and at least one 500-lb M.C. bomb and set on fire. The crew aban-abandoned the ship, which shortly afterwards sank. In the naval activity leading up to this action, another aircraft, in spite of heavy anti-aircraft fire, attacked a group of enemy destroyers and claimed one hit with a 500-lb. bomb. After the attack one of the destroyers was seen to be on fire.153. An enemy Merchant vessel was attacked on the 28th January and aU-boat on the 2nd March.154. On the 10th March two aircraft located a U-boat, escorted by four destroyers and eight Ju. 88&apos;s. While the enemy aircraft attacked one Liberator,the other Liberator attacked the destroyers. Then the first Liberator also attacked the ships, dropping a stick of bombs and depth charges while still pursued by the eight Ju. 88&apos;s, one of which is claimed as probably destroyed. This aircraft was damaged and the navigator wounded. Results of the attacks could not be observed.Morale: &quot;155. In the Fighter Squadrons morale is reported as good, and sometimesof the highest order. In the Coastal Squadron it has been uniformly highamongst both flying and ground personnel. Relations between the Czech andBritish ground personnel remain cordial. Morale amongst 25 Czech aircrewpersonnel in Transport Command is good, and this is noteworthy because mostof these are in No. 24 Squadron, which has not been so fully occupied during recent months as it has been in the past.Recruiting.156.   Only 15 recruits have been enlisted during the period.Royal Hellenic Air Force.157. No. 335 and No. 336 Day Fighter Squadrons have been employed with no. 212 Group on shipping protection and local defence. Each Squadron hasflown, during the period, about 540 operational sorties. Both Squadrons are nowarmed with Spitfire aircraft, and this has given great satisfaction.158. No. 13 Hellenic (G.R.) Squadron appeared at the beginning of theyear not to be reaching the standard of efficiency required, and was withdrawnfrom operations for re-training. It has been re-equipped with Baltimore LightBomber aircraft and it will, it is expected, shortly be active once again. A marked improvement has been observed since the recent appointment of a newCommanding Officer.
159. About 120 recruits have been selected for the Air Force from refugees from Samos.160. Morale has been fairly satisfactory in the fighter squadrons, but isstill low in No. 13 (Ff.) Squadron.Royal Yugoslav Air Force.161. The Yugoslav Fighter Flight is still operating with No. 94 R.A.F.Squadron on shipping protection duty. Owing, however, to the growing tension between the Partisans and the Government supporters it is doubtful whetherthis Flight will be able to operate much longer.162. Morale and discipline in the Fighter Flight is nevertheless still good,notwithstanding the highly charged political atmosphere.163. Marshal Tito&apos;s ratification is being sought of the minutes of a meetingheld at Headquarters, M.A.A.F., on the 1st March, concerning the formationwithin the R.A.F. of a Yugoslav contingent of his supporters. If his agreement is obtained a number of Partisans, who have recently arrived in the Middle East from Bari, will be enrolled in the R.A.F.V.R. together with those dissidentR.Y.A.F. personnel in the Middle East who may wish to join. The formationof a Yugoslav Holding Unit at Benina has already been authorised.164. It is possible that the R.YA.F. itself may be so reduced in numbersthat it will have no alternative before it but to offer its remaining personnel for service, as individuals, with the R.A.F.1
