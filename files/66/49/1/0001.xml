THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVT.SECRET &apos;W.P.(44)20115th April 1944 ^ Copy no economic policy memorandum by the secretary of state Tor India.The secretary of state for Dominion Affairs has suggested in his paper W.P.(44) 192 that the&quot;acceptability or otherwise&quot; of the outcome of thediscussions so far carried on between officials shouldbe discussed with the Dominion prime Ministers.   Itseems to me essential,  if only in fairness to theDominion prime Ministers, that they should have some idea of the case against those proposals.   For thatpurpose I would strongly urge that the Memorandacritical of those proposals by myself, the Ministerof Agriculture, and sir Hubert Henderson, should be circulated to the prime Ministers   along with&apos;the memoranda in favour of the proposals.L. S. A.INDIA OFFICE.13th April 1944.
