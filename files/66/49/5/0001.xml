Copy No.secret.P. (44) 20515th April, 1944WAR CABINETMINIMUM AGE FOR MILITARY SERVICE IN AN OVERSEASTHEATRE OF war memorandum BY THE SECRETARY. OF STATE FOR WAR1. In a Memorandum which was circulated to the War Cabinet on 26th August,1943 (W.P. (43) 378), I set out reasons leading up to a request that the War cabinet should agree that the House of Commons be asked to approve a change of policy withregard to the minimum age at which troops may be sent overseas, namely, that suchminimum age be reduced from 19 years to 182. This question has become increasingly urgent owing to the allotment to the army for 1944 being only 150,000 men against our demand for 319,000 (W.P. (43) 464,paragraph 11). As a result of this, a large part of the Home Field Army will be usedto provide reinforcements for operations overseas (W.P. (43) 539, page 8, paragraph 10).As far as the infantry is concerned (and it is in this arm that the majority of young menare serving), more men will be required than exist in the Home Field Army, or will be forthcoming from intakes in time.3. It therefore becomes imperative that every trained man should be made avail-able for service overseas. The number between 18J and 19 years of age at 31st May,1944, is estimated at 16,000.4. At their 129th (43) Meeting on 20th September, 1943, the War Cabinet deferredconsideration of my Memorandum &quot; pending further consultation between the Ministerof Labour and the Secretary of State for War &quot;. This consultation was held inDecember, 1943, and it was then agreed that I could proceed on the assumption that men of i8i would go overseas with 21 Army Group.5. I am now getting many enquiries from parents whose sons (under 19) are inmobilized units, and who in consequence have had to sign certificates which statethat they are under orders for overseas. It is at present not possible for me to givesatisfactory replies to these enquiries, and I feel that the time has come for a formaldecision to enable a public statement to be made.6. I accordingly invite the War Cabinet to agree to the proposal in paragraph 1above.P- J- G.The War Office,15^ April, 1944.105  4/44  w.o.p.   17399This document is the property of His Britannic Majesff*s^GcivernmentPrinted for the War Cabinet, April, 1944
