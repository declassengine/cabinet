THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 245.1st May, 1944.WAR CABINET.NEW CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMME, 1944.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THE war has now reached the stage when we can reasonably claim to foreseethat within a more or less short space of time the main naval effort will be directed against Japan. Indeed, we can now begin to look beyond the war against Japan,and so far as concerns naval construction we must look beyond it, for ships must now be ordered longer than ever in advance of the commencement of work, sincethe time needed to assemble materials has become progressively longer as generalproduction planning has grown more complex. The programme set out below,therefore, takes account, firstly, of our estimated needs for finishing the war in theFar East, and, secondly, of those ships which will have to be ordered, though notnecessarily laid down, in the coming financial year if we are to make a timely startin providing a balanced and up-to-date post-war Fleet. In drawing up theseproposals it has been assumed, as there seems to be good reason for assuming,that after the defeat of Germany reductions in other war industries will make available increased supplies of man-power for providing the requirements ofthe Fleet.2. The 1943 New Construction Programme has been gravely upset. Ordersfor L.C.T. have had to be placed with warship-building firms and we have hadto embark on a large programme of L.S.T. ;* this has disorganised the programme as originally planned. The preparation of the Fleet Train has also to be fittedin and a number of our older ships must be refitted and, re-equipped to make themsuitable for an intensified Naval and Air war in the Far East.Outline of Programme.3.   The 1944 programme is as follows : Redesign the 4  &apos;&apos; Lion&apos;&apos; class battleships and proceed with theproduction of 6 Triple 16-inch Turrets of revised, design./   5 6-inch Cruisers./  22 Fleet destroyers.!   20 Submarines.\     5 Sloops (including 3 authorised in previous programmes).\ 32 Small type M.T.Bs.\, ^Miscellaneous small craft.&quot;Landing ships and craft are dealt with in paragraph 23 below.A aircraft Carriers.4. In the 1943 Programme the Cabinet approved the construction of fourFleet Carriers, Malta, New Zealand, Africa and Gibraltar. The plan for building these ships has been thrown out and delayed for the reasons given inparagraph 2 above. A still further interruption will occur if a follow-upprogramme of L.S.Ts. has to be carried through in the United Kingdom. Itwould, in any case, not be possible to build all these four ships without prejudicingcapacity which will be necessary for the proposed Battleships. The first two ofthese Fleet Carriers will not be laid down until some date in the first half of 1945[27385]* W.M. (43) 171st Conclusions.   Item I.b
2and it is proposed to postpone the laying down of the other two in order to leavethe way clear for laying down two Battleships as soon as the state of the designwork enables this to be done.5 Of the eight Light Fleet Carriers included in the 1943 Programme(which will be larger and faster than those of the 1942 m Programme and supplementary Programme), only four are at present being actively progressed.The need for a large number of aircraft carriers is, however, still great, and onthis ground there is every reason for building the remaining four of these vessels.It must be recognised, however, that forthcoming operations may result in suchheavy losses in cruisers that additional cruiser construction, over and above that proposed in this paper, may have to take priority even over the building of moreaircraft carriers, important though these are. If this possibility is realised, Iwould submit revised proposals to the War Cabinet at the appropriate time.Otherwise the full programme of Light Fleet Carriers approved in 1943 will be executed.Battleships.6. The Vanguard, due to enter service in 1946, is at present the onlybattleship under construction. Every effort will be made to accelerate hercompletion.The Lion, Temeraire, Conqueror and Thunderer remain suspended fromprevious programmes.7. In present circumstances a battleship takes several years to constructfrom the date of keel laying. Eighteen months must be allowed before keellaying to settle, in the light of the most recent experience, the detailed designboth of the turrets and of the ship, and to progress the work on the turrets.I estimate that by 1950 our effective battleship strength will be reduced tothose surviving out of 14 K.G.V.&apos;s.1 Vanguard.2 Modernised Nelsons.8. We are unlikely to come through unscathed in the Pacific war. On theother hand, the Admiralty consider that we should ultimately need 12 capital ships if our post-war Navy is to be a well-balanced Fleet. It is desirable,therefore, to proceed now with the preliminary work to allow us to reinstate the battleship programme in the near future.9. I therefore ask for approval to revise the design of the ships and theturrets and to proceed with the construction of 6 16-inch turrets to the newdesign, to enable us to lay down the Lion and Temeraire with the ships of the1945 Programme.Cruisers.10. In the 1942 and 1943 Programmes I called attention to the need for aircraft Carriers, and stated that, in order to provide the necessary air component of the Fleet, I was prepared to forgo the construction of Cruisers. Accordingly,no Cruisers were included in the 1943 Programme, and we also cancelled Cruisersoutstanding from previous programmes.11. Our new construction in Cruisers as it now stands is confined to thecompletion of 3 in 1944, 3 in 1945 and one in 1946; a total addition of 7 ships toour present strength.12. The modern Cruiser takes some 3 years to build; and, iassuming that facilities cannot be made available until 1945, it is necessary to review our Cruiserstrength of 1948. Our effective strength in Cruisers at that date will amount tothose that survive out of the following : -Heavy Cruisers (8-inch)   ......      ...      ...      ...      10Medium Cruisers (6-inch and over 6,000 tons displace-^ment)    ...&quot;    ...      ...      ...      ... 27Light Cruisers (6-inch and under, less than 6,000 tonsdisplacement)   ...       ...      ...       ...       ... 14Of these, the 8-inch cruisers will be over age, having seen some 20 years&apos;service,.and m the Medium Cruiser Class those surviving out of the 5 Leanderswill have seen 14 to 17 years&apos; service.  The losses experienced so far average about
5 Cruisers a year, so that, if this can be taken as an indication of what we may expect in the future years of war, the strength shown above may be reduced bysome 20 Cruisers.13. Whatever the future losses may prove to be, the Admiralty consider thatwe can no longer forgo the construction of cruisers required by 1948 to replace the older ships and maintain the surface striking-power of the Fleet.14. In the 1943 Programme the Admiralty were inclined to favour a cruiserwith 5-25-inch guns, to the exclusion, for the time being, of the 6-inch-guncruiser. Further experience and investigation of the design problems involved,however, show that the greater need, for the present at least, is for a 6-inch gun.I, therefore, include 5 6-inch Cruisers in this programme. I expect that the) necessary facilities will become available to lay down and commence work on these ships in the second and third quarters of 1945.Since these 5 cruisers will only replace one year&apos;s wastage at the rate hithertoexperienced, additional cruiser construction may be needed if we experienceunusually heavy losses this year (vide paragraph 5).Destroyers.15. As in the past, our destroyers will be required to play a prominent partin all future operations. The casualty rate is always high and, in consequence,the build-up of strength is slow. I propose to continue our policy of the past by including in this programme as many Destroyers as our capacity allows.16. Facilities should become available for the construction of 14 Battle class and 8 Weapon Class destroyers; the last of these would be laid down in theAutumn of 1945.  I ask for these 22 destroyers.Submarines.17. Our deficiency lies in submarines possessing the long range required forFar Eastern operations. As stated in the 1943 Programme, we nave developed a new design, the &quot;A&quot; Class, which is suitable for this purpose and embodiesall the modern equipment developed as a result of experience throughout theWar. The existing programmes include a total of 46 &quot;A&quot; Class submarines.Submarine losses have averaged 20 a year over the past four years and this experience must be taken into account in settling the further provision to be made.18. The &quot; A &quot; Class submarine takes on the average somewhat over twelvemonths to build, so that any now approved may&apos; be expected to enter service during 1946.I include 20 &quot; A &quot; Class submarines in this Programme. We have cancelledorders, approved in previous programmes, for 10 &quot; U &quot; Class submarines, since these do not have the long range now required.Sloops.19. During the last two years we have cut down the construction of Sloopsin order to use the capacity for Frigates and Corvettes, which can be producedmore quickly. In view of the present favourable trend of the U-boat war, wehave already cancelled 56 of the Corvettes (including 36 from Canada) and 61 ofthe Frigates approved in previous programmes.20. Unlike the Frigate and Corvette, which are essentially anti-submarinevessels, and nothing more,. the Sloop provides good A.A. protection, by virtue ofher 6 4-inch guns on three twin mountings, as well as fulfilling all the require-ments of an anti-submarine vessel. These ships are designed to operate in ar,independent role all over the world. They possess good endurance and areasonable turn of speed.The amphibious assaults in the Eastern Theatre which may be staged overlong distances will need the best A.A. protection we can provide. Apart fromthe Fleet Destroyer, the Sloop is the best equipped vessel for meeting these requirements, and we therefore intend to deploy as many of these vessels in theEastern Theatre as possible.21. I ask for approval to order 5 Sloops of the Modified Black Swan Class,of which 3 can be reinstated from programmes approved by the War Cabinet in1941 and 1942.[27385] b 2
Coastal Forces.22. The Admiralty do not expect to need to place any further orders to supplement the strength of our coastal forces. Formal approval is, however,sought for the construction of 32 Small-Type M.T.B.S to provide for wastage andalready ordered with Treasury sanction, to ensure continuity of production.Landing Craft and Ships.. 23. We are continuing to build all those types of landing craft required forforthcoming operations. I have therefore included provision in the programme for such numbers as will, broadly speaking, absorb capacity for a further twelvemonths, but I should propose to review the situation as soon as the outlook is reasonably clear and make a more specific submission to the Cabinet then. Thedetails of the interim provision are set out in Table I of the Annex to this paper.The construction of further L.S.T.S when the ships already authorisedcomplete has been the subject of discussion by the Defence Committee. the follow-up programme required is 78 -36 to replace wastage and 42 to increasethe assault lift from three to four divisions. The construction of furtherL.S.T.S in the United Kingdom could only be at heavy cost in merchant and war-ship building, and no final decision has been taken. 36 further L.S.T.S could,however, be built in the Dominions without interfering with the present warshipand merchant ship programmes. These would replace wastage, and, as I considerthat it is desirable that we should be able to replace our own wastage from ourown sources, I ask authority to place orders in the Dominions for these further36 L.S.T.&amp;.Small Craft.24. As usual I seek approval for the large number of miscellaneous small craft required for the servicing of the Fleet and all the other maritime activities in which we have to engage.Ships of previous Programmes cancelled.25. As mentioned in paragraphs 18 and 19 above, we have cancelled orders,approved in previous Programmes for 10 &quot; TJ &quot; Class Submarines, 56 Corvettesand 61 Frigates. In addition, it is not now intended to proceed with the follow-ing ships authorised in 1943 and earlier Programmes, but not ordered : 16 Small M.T.B.S (50-foot, authorised in 1942).10 Steam Gun Boats.4 Boom Defence Vessels.6 Fleet Minesweepers.Other Vessels.26. My colleagues will observe that there are a large number of warshipcategories not represented in this programme. This is because the Admiraltyhope that programmes already approved will meet our need in these types. If,however, losses should prove so heavy as to falsify this expectation, I shall seekapproval for the necessary replacements in a later supplementary programme.27. Statements are appended showing the estimated cost of this programmeseparately and in conjunction with previous programmes.A. V. A.yAdmiralty, S.W. 1,1st May, 1944.

A certain amount of expen-diture has already been incurred on the turrets of the original design; only a portion of this workwill be of utility in the revised design.No provision has been made for two (of four) Heavy Fleet Carriers of the 1943 Programme (see paragraph 4 of Memorandum).See also footnote to Table I.
