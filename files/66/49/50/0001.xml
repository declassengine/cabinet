THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.SECRET. / Copy No. 3f&quot;W.P. (44) 250.11th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.POLITICAL SITUATION IN INDIA.Memorandum by Secretary of State for India.I think that my colleagues may be interested to see the attached note by theViceroy on the political situation in India. In a covering communication theViceroy says that this note is not intended as a final statement of his views, but rather as an indication of his present assessment of the situation as a result of six months in office.L. S. A.India Office, 11th May, 1944.Note on the Political Situation in India by the Viceroy, dated April 1944.1. It is quite a small percentage of India&apos;s population that takes an active,or even passive, interest in politics at any time; and the proportion is at presentprobably smaller than usual. The great majority of Indians are on the wholemore prosperous than usual; cultivators get high prices for their grain, andmany have paid off their debts and are living better than is normal with them,and labourers find little difficulty in getting employment at good wages. Itwould probably not be wrong to say that India as a whole is in easier circum-stances than for some time, though this does not mean that poverty is not stillwidespread and the general standard of living still deplorably low. The prestige of the &quot; Sirkar &quot; is probably higher than for some time; it has shown its ability to maintain law and order, and to effect some control of prices; also the war is going well.2. The politically conscious minority comprises on the Hindu sidepractically all educated men and women lawyers, doctors, those engaged in business, students and so forth. They are almost entirely supporters of Congress,which commands the support of the Press, the political machine and the purse-strings of big business. Many of their supporters realise the barren andineffective policy of the Working Committee; but they seem to have no ideasbeyond the release of the leaders and a return to the old factious politics andwrecking tactics of opposition. The cry for the release of the leaders is largely a matter of injured prestige, due to the sentiment that it is an insult that the&quot; chosen of the people &quot; should be in confinement, whatever their policy. &quot; Thepeople,&quot; so constantly on the lips of Congress politicians, really means littlemore than the high caste Hindus, though by use of the Press and the politicalmachine they can always produce evidence of popular support. The adherentsof Congress recognise that the Government still has the support of the majorityof the people in the maintenance of law and order, and has the power to carryon without concession to or release of the leaders. This knowledge makes thembitter and frustrated. There is certainly a great deal of bitterness amongst theeducated Hindus, which shows itself in a certain satisfaction at our militarysetbacks and losses, and does its best to magnify them.The leaders themselves from their places of confinement show no signwhatever of changing their policy or wishing to co-operate.  Mrs. Naidu, recently[27445] &apos;
2released, has been quite uncompromising as to their intentions. Mr. Gandhihimself maintains his attitude of injured innocence and righteous self-approval.3. Amongst those who are not avowed supporters of Congress, or have broken away from, it, there seems little or no power of leadership. The oldliberals such as Tej Bahadur Sapru, Jayakar, Maharaj Singh-do not impressme as having any constructive ideas, force of character, or ability to command afollowing. Raj agopalachariar is the ablest of those who have broken away from congress, but has no following and little prospect of securing one.Of the other parties, I know little of the Mahasabha or its leaders, but donot imagine there is much spirit of compromise or co-operation there.Dr. Ambedkar has a certain following amongst the Depressed Classes, but it isnot influential. M. N. Roy is a more forcible character than most of the indian political leaders, he has the elements of a party, and with Government supportmight gain more followers. But generally there is no party or leaders outsideCongress and the Muslim League at present able to command any large following,or to influence elections.4. Generally speaking, the educated Muslim class is less politically mindedthan the Hindu and less educated but the Muslim League under Jinnah is making every effort to enrol all Muslim opinion under its banner and to makeit militant. Jinnah has seized the opportunity of the Congress eclipse tostrengthen the position of the League, with great success. While his party is inthe ascendant and growing in power, he has no intention of coming to terms with Congress and is anxious to prevent the Government doing so. It is probablyfor this reason that he is opposing Government in the Legislature, and he feelshe may make himself strong enough to threaten Government and force it to cometo terms with him. Beyond Pakistan, I do not think he has any constructiveideas, and I doubt whether he has any clear constructive ideas about Pakistanitself. He is an ambitious politician, and does not really represent the solidconservative Muslim spirit. He has probably, however, the power to stir up alot of trouble and the will to do so in pursuit of his ambitions.5. There seems little prospect at present of the two main parties coming-together, and even supposing they did agree to unite in forming a &quot; national government,&quot; I feel that it would be a &apos;&apos; Pull devil, pull baker &quot; affair, moreintent on communal advantage than on administrative efficiency and economic progress.Is there any prospect of forming a Centre Government party, which would command popular support and a majority in the Legislature; and which wouldbe content to concentrate on administrative problems and -leave the constitutional problem to be settled gradually? I see little hope of such a party at present,but it might possibly develop. I think such a government might have to enlist the support of the Muslim League, but it would not be easy to negotiate withJinnah except on the basis of recognising Pakistan more explicitly than theCripps offer does. There is a sad lack of trained administrative ability in india at present, but a good deal which could be trained.As a corollary of such a Central Government, one would presumably hope toget Coalition Governments started in Section 93 Provinces.6. On the whole, the only policy at the moment seems to be to keep thepossibility of a Working (rather than Political) National Government in mind,but to sit tight and await developments.It is possible that the Congress leaders may make a move, though I think itis most unlikely that they will withdraw the Quit India motion;, they would possibly like to start an argument about the terms on which they would withdrawor modify it. But their minds are unchanged, and they are still out to wreckcompletely the present system, not to develop it gradually into self-government.Jinnah may think himself strong enough to challenge Government on the pakistan issue and demand recognition of it or the withdrawal of support fromthe war effort. This might be dangerous but is unlikely at present. Jinnahmight also challenge Government by development of his &quot;private army.&quot;** This refers to threats which have been made from time to time that the Muslim Leaguewould organise a force to defend its interests by force of arms if the need arise. No muslim league &quot; private army &quot; yet exists but there is a League organisation of &quot; National Guards &quot; forgiving assistance in Civil Defence, and at a recent session of the Muslim League in Karachi twothousand of the guards from all parts of India dressed in grey uniform took part in a procession.
7. The combination of Congress and the Muslim League in the present sessionof the Legislature to defeat Government measures is largely, I think, anacknowledgment of the success of Government in maintaining law and order,tackling the food problem, keeping prices stable and, in fact, establishing itself in the minds of the people as an effective and reasonably beneficent &quot; Sirkar.&quot;To sum up, I am afraid I can see no clearer policy than to work towards a Central party with more popular support than the present Government, andto await events. I do not see any prospect at present of forming a body to considerthe constitutional problem, whose opinions would carry any weight in India,and I do not think it worth while to attempt to do so.Meanwhile there is an immense amount of administrative work to be done,fjl both for the immediate present and in preparation for the future, and my councils doing it reasonably well. It would certainly be folly to attempt to replace it until one is certain of getting a much better and. more representative body.W.April 1944.
