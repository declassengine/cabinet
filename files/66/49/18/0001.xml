THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET ijfWjP..  (44)  SIS V ^ Copy No.      ^32nd April, 1944.W A R      CABINETLIVESTOCK AND MILK PRICESy? Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, theSecretary of State for Scotland,  the Secretary of State forthe Home Department and the Minister of Food.1. At their meeting of 25th January, 1944 (War Cabinet 11(44)Conclusion 2),  the War Cabinet authorised an announcement in theAgricultural Debate on the following day that the G-overnmentwere prepared to extend the guarantee of the system of fixed prices and an assured market for agricultural commodities upto and including the harvest of 1947 as part of the foodproduction plan for the next four years.      The War Cabinetwithheld assent to a proposal that the announcement should include a statement that actual minimum prices for livestockwould be fixed now for the period up to 1947, but  it was. recognised that this question could be raised again later.2. The question of long-term guarantees for milk, fat stockand eggs up to the summer of 1948 and of certain increases in actual prices of fat cattle and sheep in the twelve monthsJuly 1944 to June 1945 were considered by the Lord President&apos;sCommittee on 12th April last  (L.P.(44)17th Meeting,  Conclusion 1).^ -3. In their submission to the Committee (L.P.(44)62) theAgricultural Ministers and the Minister of Food made threeproposals:-(i) Producers of milk, fat cattle and sheep should be offered a four-year guarantee up to the summer of1948 of an assured market and of price levels notless than those at present prevailing.(ii)    The Government should guarantee a market for theentire home output of fat pigs and eggs during theperiod up to 1947/48 and undertake,  as supplies of feeding stuffs improve,  to fix appropriate pricesfrom time to time such as would encourage a revival of production up to at least pre-war levels as rapidly as possible.      Prices should be reviewedlater in the year.(iii)    prices of fat cattle and sheep in 1944/45 should be adjusted with a bias towards quality to give an average increase of 2/- per live cwt. for fat cattle and of Id.per lb. for sheep, with no change in the price of wool,0   4. The Minister of Food is  satisfied that substantially increased quantities of milk and meat of home production will be needed in the next four years.      World supplies of both milk products and meat are likely to be short for the whole of thatperiod.      The demand for milk is steadily rising and production would have to be raised very- considerably if the restrictions onits sale to domestic consumers are to be lifted by 1947/8. and the quantities likely to be absorbed by the present assisted schemesfor mothers and children are to be met in full..     An earlyrestoration of pre-war levels of meat production is essential to
permit the derationing of meat at the  earliest possible date.      Thenecessary increase in production of these commodities must be planned well ahead and is unlikely to be achieved without an assurance of price stability.      Moreover the negotiations now proceeding for long-term contracts for the purchase of meat anddairy products from overseas producers render it politicallyessential to give appropriate guarantees to farmers in the UnitedKingdom.      The  above proposals,  taken in conjunction with other measures already introduced,  should,  in the opinion of the 4hAgricultural Departments,   secure an increase in the output of milk iand meat in this country as soon as possible to the fullest extentallowed by our resources.5. pigs and eggs present a rather different loroblem and recovery of production, though desirable,  depends more onavailability of feeding stuffs than on prices.      There are obvious objections to encouraging a revival of production of these commodities,  which can be achieved rapidly,  until substantiallylarger supplies of feeding stuffs become available.      Moreover pigs and poultry can be more rapidly increased than milk,  cattle and sheep.      Further,  as soon as increased quantities of feedingstuffsbecome available the increase in the production of eggs which wouldtake place even without an increase in our prices would lead to asubstantial rise in the total cost to the Exchequer of the subsidyrequired to stabilize the retail price of eggs.      The Lord- President&apos;s Committee accordingly decided that no commitment inregard to fat pigs and eggs should be made at the present time.6* It was agreed, however,   to recommend to the War Cabinetthat the Agricultural Ministers should be authorised to inform theNational Farmers&apos; Union that the Government  are prepared to offerproducers of milk, fat cattle and sheep a four-year guarantee upto the summer of 1948 of an assured market and of price levelsnot less than those at present prevailing.      The  special reasons why the Government thought it right and necessary to offer thisparticular guarantee should be explained to the National FarmersrUnion,  and it should be emphasised that the Government are notprepared to make similar offers in respect of other agricultural products or to commit themselves to any given standard ofprofitability for farmers as a whole until they had had anopportunity to consider comprehensive proposals supported by fullstatistical data.      The National Farmers&apos;  Union should also beinformed that the Government anticipated that during the courseof the four years there would have to be some reductions in theprices of certain agricultural products such as cereals and potatoes.7. The Lord President&apos;s Committee also agreed to recommendthat prices of fat cattle and sheep should be adjusted for theyear 1944/45 with a bias towards quality so as to give anaverage increase of 2/- per live cwt. for cattle and of Id. per lb.. for sheep,  with no change in the price of wool.      these increases are appreciably less than would, be required to offset the rise in costs of production that has occurred since theprevious review in January 1942.      The cost to the Exchequer willbe approximately  2*4 millions.      They are, however,  considered tobe sufficient to provide the necessary initial inrpetus to recovery of pre-war production.S. The Chancellor of the Exchequer who presided at themeeting of the Lord President&apos;s Committee in the absence of theLord President,  concurs in the recommendations.
9, The War Cabinet&apos;s approval is accordingly sought to(a) Agricultural Ministers being authorised to inform theNational Farmers&apos;  Union that the Government areprepare! to offer producers of milk,  fat cattle and sheep a four year guarantee up to the summer of 1948of an assured market and of price levels not lessthan those at present prevailing subject to theconditions set out  in paragraph 6;(b) the proposals as regards the prices of fat cattle and sheep for the year 1944/45 set out in paragraph 7.(Itld.)
