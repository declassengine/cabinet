THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1944.SECEET.W.P. (44) 246.8th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.REQUISITIONED ESTONIAN SHIPS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN October and November 1940 the Minister of Shipping requisitionedcertain Estonian ships which were at that time in British waters. In August1940 Estonia had been incorporated into the U.S.S.R., and the Russians haveclaimed that by reason of certain legislation these ships were Soviet property; ingeneral, they have, however, not pressed this claim to the extent of trying toobtain possession of the ships or of the hire arising from their use. Prior to the incorporation of Estonia, the ships had been the property of the Tallinn ShippingCompany, and a number of Estonian and Swedish nationals, who claim to be thesuccessors in title of the Tallinn Shipping Company, have from time to timeshown signs of making a claim against the Minister of War Transport for compensation for the use of the ships and, in addition, in the case of the ships which have been lost, compensation for their total loss. Hitherto it has beenpossible to prevent any litigation in connexion with these ships (in one or two small cases by buying out the claimants) and no compensation has actually been paid to anybody for their use.2. It now seems probable that in the very near future claims will be madeby some of the Estonian and Swedish nationals in respect of nine ships, the total sum involved being not less than  250,000. It would be possible to buy out the claimants in this case too, but, if this were to be done, the news would quickly getabout and would mean that anybody who could bring a colourable claim in theUnited Kingdom Courts in respect of property which originally belonged to persons or companies in the Baltic States would know that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would pay up rather than face the difficulties which would be involved if the cases came to Court. I have therefore authorised the Ministry ofWar Transport to inform the present claimants&apos; solicitors that, if the caseproceeds and if I am asked by the Court questions as to the governmentalauthority in Estonia at the date of requisition, I shall reply to the effect that, atthe date when the requisitioning orders were made, effective administrativecontrol in Estonia was exercised by the Government of the U.S.S.R. This willprobably have the effect of dissuading the claimants from pursuing their claim,and the solicitors are being told that, in the case of the genuine part-owners whohave put their life savings into these ships, as distinct from the larger owners,whose titles are uncertain and whose claims are in any case highly speculative,something will be paid by way of compensation.3. If the case does, in fact, proceed and it becomes necessary for me to make this statement, it would merely mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government werestating as a fact for the information of the Court that, at a certain moment oftime, it was the Soviet Government, and not the Estonian Government, whichexercised effective administrative control in the territory of Estonia. This wouldmean only that His Majesty&apos;s Government recognised as a fact that it was theRussians who then were in control; it would not mean that they recognised thatthe Russians had any legal right to exercise that control, or that by exercising itthey acquired any legitimate right or title to be regarded as the sovereign inEstonia. Only de jure recognition would carry that implication, and the state-ment which I am prepared to make would not mean that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment recognised any change in the legal status of Estonia and thereforedoes not conflict with the declarations which have already been made about notrecognising territorial changes brought about by force.A. E.Foreign Of/ice, 8th May, 1944.12359   [27432]
