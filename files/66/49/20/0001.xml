THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GQYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 220.22nd April, 1944.WAR CABINET.FUTURE WORLD ORGANISATION.MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD PRESIDENT  OF  THE  COUNCIL.I attach a minute by the Minister of State covering a series of memoranda on Future World Organisation prepared by a team of officials working underthe Minister of State.2. The memoranda have been considered by the Armistice and Post-War Committee. A few small amendments recommended by the Committee havebeen incorporated in them. In addition, the Committee have certain comments onMemorandum C which are shown in the Appendix at page 25. We recommend,subject to the decision on the points raised in the Appendix, that Memoranda Ato E should be used as a basis for discussion with the Dominion Prime minister during their forthcoming visit. It will be for consideration by the War Cabinetwhether copies of the memoranda should actually be tabled. The Vice-Chiefs ofStaff are averse to the tabling of Memorandum C at pages 15 to 20 in its present form.3. If it is decided to table all or some of these memoranda, it should be explained to the Dominion Prime Ministers that, subject to any amendments which may be made as a result of discussion with them, it is proposed to use the papers so tabled as a basis for discussion in the forthcoming exploratory talks atWashington with representatives of the United States and the U.S.S.R.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,22nd April, 1944.[U 3128/180/70]FUTURE WORLD ORGANISATION.Forthcoming Conversations at Washington.IN Article 4 of the Moscow Declaration of November 1943 the Four Powersstate &quot; that they recognise the necessity of establishing at the earliest practic-able date a general international organisation, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States, and open to membership by all such States, large and small, for the maintenance of international peace and security.&quot;2. When the Declaration was discussed at the Moscow Conference Mr. Hullsuggested that it might be signed at a later date by the other United Nations.M. Molotov subsequently proposed that a Commission of the Three Powers shouldbe formed to study Article 4 of the Declaration. At a later session Mr. Hullsuggested &quot; an informal understanding to acquire material for constituting theCommission,&quot; and in reply to M. Molotov agreed to an &quot; unofficial Commission.&quot;He added, &quot;that they could gradually select persons to work together and decide on the peace : sometimes in Moscow, sometimes London, sometimes in Washing-ton.&quot; Mr. Hull emphasised the secrecy which should surround such discussions.[27327] b
Agreement was incorporated in the Secret Protocol of the Moscow Conference,para. 2 (&amp;), as follows : &apos;&apos;&apos; It was recognised as desirable that representatives of the United Statesof America, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union should conduct in a preliminary fashion an exchange of views on questions connected with theestablishment of an international organisation for the maintenance of inter-national peace and security, the intention being that this work should becarried out in the first instance in Washington, and also in London and moscow.&apos;&apos;3. On the 19th November, 1943, a note was received from the United StatesCharge d&apos;Affaires in London suggesting, on instructions from the State Depart-ment, that the Four Powers should announce that they would welcome the adherence of all peace-loving States to&apos; Article 4 of the Declaration. A corres-ponding communication was made to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and china. In reply His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom suggestedthat this step was premature in view of the agreement at Moscow to have pre-liminary Three-Power discussions. The Dominions were informed of theproposal, and the Canadian Government in particular thought that a longerdocument should be prepared before the signature of the other United nations was invited. The United States Government accepted the British suggestion and the Soviet Government also, though the latter had agreed to the originalUnited States proposal. The United Kingdom and United States Governmentsexchanged agenda for the Washington discussions which were communicated tothe Soviet Government, and the, United States Government suggested a pre-liminary exchange of papers. Subsequently the United Kingdom government proposed that memoranda should be written on the five main topics enumeratedbelow. The United States Government agreed that our papers should be written on these topics, though their own might have somewhat different titles. TheSoviet Government also agreed generally to the suggested procedure, reserving thequestion of priority of topics.   The five topics are as follows :  A. Scope and nature of an international organisation.B. Guarantees and the pacific settlement of disputes.C. Security.D. Co-ordination of economic and political international machinery.E. Method and procedure for establishing a world organisation.4. These, therefore, are the subject headings of the accompanying Memor-anda, which are designed, if my colleagues agree, to be handed to the dominion prime Ministers, and subsequently to the Americans and Russians, In themmy advisers and I have attempted to sketch the outline of a workable world organisation in the light of experience of international institutions. Theproposals do not provide a complete solution of all the problems discussedbecause many of the premises on which such conclusions could be based do notyet exist. We suggest, however, that our first aim should be to bring the world organisation into existence. When it has been established, it should be able tofind out by its own experience the methods by which international problems maybe solved.5. The Organisation suggested has much in common with the Covenant ofthe League of Nations and, in accordance with the expressed intention of thePrime Minister, it tries to retain all the best features of its predecessor. But itis meant to be more flexible, less bound by rigid definitions which hamper orprevent necessary action, and above all endowed with the machinery to makeaction effective. In short, our plan is based on the acceptance of certain essentialprinciples and we leave the means by which these principles shall be carried out to be adapted to the varying circumstances of human intercourse which cannotbe foreseen.6. It is thus that the institutions of Britain and the Commonwealth have grown, and it is this method that their peoples will best understand. Our methodof approach may possibly make less appeal to the more legally minded peopleof the United States, who attach so much importance to the details of a writtenconstitution, or to the Russians, whose way of thinking is very different from ourown, or to the peoples of the Continent of Europe, who have a different system oflaw and have always desired explicit undertakings no matter how often they havebeen broken. But, though changes may have to be made to meet these points ofview, we believe that something like what we suggest represents the maximum of effective international co-operation that can be secured at the present time.
7. Naturally we must not agree to anything which might impair the harmonyof the Commonwealth or the integrity of the British Empire. But subject to this it will be essential to obtain an organisation embracing the United Kingdom andthe Dominions, the United States and the U.S.S.R. and, it might perhaps be added,France. This, therefore, should be our primary object and no minor consideration should be allowed to stand in its way.8. The establishment of a centre where the policies of the principal Statesof the world, can be harmonised is in the great tradition of British policy, andwe believe that the present proposals carry on a development which was supportedby Castlereagh, Palmerston, Salisbury and Grey before the last war and byLord Balfour, Sir Austen Chamberlain and Mr. Arthur Henderson in the period between the wars.9. We attach great importance to the establishment of some permanent machinery by which rapid and effective action may be taken against any threat to world peace. The world has seen so many promises broken that faith in thenew institution can only be obtained if the means of action are visible, and will,perhaps, only be confirmed after such action has taken place.10. It is essential to the interests of the British Commonwealth that theOrganisation should be world-wide. We have, therefore, subordinated thecreation of regional organisations to this end. But we believe that in due courseregional organisations (which will probably develop naturally) may play animportant part in the world and that if they are suitably guided within theWorld Organisation their advantages will outweigh their disadvantages.11 In Memorandum A we have assumed that the World Council will consist of the Four Powers and a number of other States. We have left open the method by which these States are chosen because we think that it would be premature to put forward a cut-and-dried scheme at this stage. We have not even laid down the principle that one of the members of the Commonwealthother than the United Kingdom should always have a place on the World Council.Such a demand may very likely provoke a counter demand from the SovietGovernment that one of the constituent republics of the U.S.S.R. should always have a seat on the World Council. Whether it can be ensured that one of theDominions shall always have a place on the Council must obviously depend onthe number of Council members. But we recognise that it should be our objectto obtain this result.12. We have also left open the questions of the Secretariat and the seat of the Organisation, problems closely interrelated. They raise issues on whichit is likely to be difficult to come to an agreement and we think that it wouldbe better to postpone them to a later stage of the discussions.13. Under our proposals, great power would rest in the hands of the world council. It would, for instance, take the initiative in action to maintain peace,and other members would be bound to follow its decisions. We have, however,left open the question of placing permanently a special responsibility on theGreat Powers for the maintenance of international peace and security. By doing so the association of the United States in the burden would be more explicitlyobtained, but it may well be possible to secure that advantage without suchdefinition as might seem to imply too great a recognition of the position of theGreat Powers in the Organisation.14. We have not mentioned the Colonial question. It may have to appear on the Agenda of the tripartite discussions in deference to the wishes of theUnited States. They have, however, preferred to raise it privately with theUnited Kingdom in the first instance, and informal discussions have been taking-place with members of Mr. Stettinius&apos;s mission.15. In Memorandum B the machinery for the pacific settlement of disputes and the maintenance of peace and security has been made as flexible as possible.The members of the British Commonwealth have always been opposed to suchguarantees of territorial integrity and political independence as those containedin Article X of the Covenant.  Our proposals contain three main propositions :-(i) That the members of the Organisation shall promise to settle all disputes in such a manner as not to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security without, however, guaranteeing the territorial integrity and political independence of member States.   (We have&apos;[27327]&apos; b 2
attempted in this manner, so far as can be done at the present stage of international relations, to throw the balance rather more in thedirection of change.)(ii) That the World Council shall be given the initiative to take action forthe maintenance of peace and security. (It is only in this way that machinery can be set up to make the promises of the memberseffective.)(iii) That action by the Organisation shall be based on principles rather thanon elaborate definition (which we believe defeats its own purpose.)16. In Memorandum C we have merely edited in a form suitable for communication to the Americans and Russians the two papers already blessedby the Chiefs of Staff as suitable to be used as a basis for discussions. The wayis thus left open to utilise existing machinery for co-operation in military mattersif it is found possible to do so at the end of the war. We have suggested that themembers should be prepared to place military forces at the disposal of the world council, by which means we hope the burden on this country and the Dominionsmay be reduced.17. We have only made a passing reference to the regulation ofarmaments, which the United States Government have placed on their list oftopics. But our own proposals would enable this country eventually to deal withthis question constructively as part of the process for sharing the burden of the armaments necessary to maintain international peace and security, rather thanby the negative means of limitation of armaments by scales and numbers.18. In Memorandum D we have endeavoured to find a method of giving thenecessary co-ordination to the new and untried economic and technical organisa-tions without depriving them of the necessary control over their own actions.Here again the questions of organisation must be worked out in the light of experience, but it is essential that these institutions should be co-ordinated inorder that the problems of full employment and the proper use of resources maybe solved.19. The United States Government will naturally decide for itself the best methods by which an international organisation can secure the assent of Congress.But we have put forward the proposals contained in Memorandum E as anassistance to their thinking on this subject, and we attach considerable importanceto choosing the right method of associating other States with the work of theFour Powers.R. K. LAW.Foreign Office, l%th April, 1944.
SECRET.Memorandum A. -SCOPE AND NATURE OF THE PERMANENT ORGANISATION.I. The Principles and Objects of the Organisation.I. The World Organisation will consist of independent States freelyassociated and working together for the better realisation of the common goodof mankind.2. The principles and objects of the Organisation should be stated in the preamble of the document which brings it into existence. The organisation should be as simple and flexible as possible. Thus the statement of its principles and objects becomes specially important, since they lay down the conditions inwhich action is taken by the members of the Organisation.3. Article 4 of the Moscow Declaration lays down that the organisation shall be based on the &quot; sovereign equality &quot; of States. Two principles follow from these words. In the first place members must agree to respect each other&apos;political independence, and secondly all members enjoy equality of status, though not necessarily equality of function.4. Members should not be entitled to receive the benefits of the Organisationunless they are prepared to accept the obligations that go with them. Moreover,it is the assumption of such obligations by all members that ensures to all thebenefits of the Organisation. This should be recognised, therefore, as one of theprinciples of the Organisation.5. The object of the Organisation is stated in Article 4 to be the &quot; main-tenance of international peace and security,&quot; and this must be regarded as itsprimary purpose.6. But if recourse to violence is ruled out, means must be provided by which members of the Organisation can settle their disputes by other than violentmethods; and the establishment of machinery for achieving this must be one ofthe objects of the Organisation.7. Moreover, in order that international peace and security shall bemaintained there must be in the world some means by which States meet together to review and harmonise their political action. One of the objects of theOrganisation, therefore, must be to create a meeting place where statesmen can come together for that purpose.8. But international peace and security must be made positively, and notonly kept by the negative means of suppressing violence. They will be confirmedand strengthened by guarding the right of man to seek his freedom, and byincrease in the well-being of human society. Statesmen of the United nations have declared this to be both the purpose and the condition of development in international order.9. It will be necessary, therefore, for the Organisation to create institutionsto promote the betterment of world-wide economic conditions and the removalof social wrongs, and to support and extend institutions which now exist for these purposes.10. Thus the principles and objects of the Organisation, and consequently the conditions in which its members receive its benefits and accept its obligations and on which actions taken under its authority are based, may be described asfollows: II. Principles.(i) That all members of the Organisation undertake to respect.each other&apos;political independence,(ii) That all members are equal in status though not necessarily in function,(iii) That all members undertake to fulfil towards each other the obligations which are the conditions of receiving the benefits of the Organisation.
12.   Objects.(i) To ensure that peace and security shall be maintained so that men shallnot live in fear of war.(ii) To provide means by which all disputes arising between States may beso dealt with that peace and security are not endangered,(lii) To provide a centre in which the political action of States can be reviewed and harmonised, and directed towards a common end.(iv) To promote the betterment of world-wide economic conditions and thewell-being of all men by international agreement so that the fear ofwant may be removed from the world,(v) To guard and enlarge the freedom of man by institutions for theremoval of social wrongs.II. The Nature of the Organisation.13. In Article 4 of the Moscow Declaration it is laid down that theorganisation is to be founded on the sovereign equality of its members. its members will, therefore, retain control of their own actions except so far as theyare limited by the obligations into which they freely enter and by internationallaw.14. Nothing has been more clearly proved during the present war thanthe interconnexion of peace and security in all parts of the world. The future organisation must recognise this fact and be a world organisation in Avhich allpeaceful States in every part of the world can co-operate together for their mutual benefit.15. Though the status of all members is equal and all will enjoy the same rights and undertake the corresponding obligations, their differences in powermake necessary some recognition of differences in function. The initiativefor the formation of the organisation has come from the Four Powers, the UnitedStates, the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom and China, and it is generally recognised that its success will depend more upon their continued co-operationthan on any other single factor. The machinery of the organisation should makeit possible for them to carry out the responsibilities which they will have agreedto undertake. The same principle applies to all other States. The more powerand responsibility can be made to correspond, the more likely is it that themachinery will be able to fulfil its functions.16. We look forward to the liberation of France and her restoration tothe ranks of the Great Powers.17. It is presumed that there will come into existence a number of specialised technical organisations through which States will combine together for various purposes. There are already such organisations in existence as partof the system of the League of Nations. The relations of these bodies to one another and to the main organisation are considered in Memo. D. Here it need only be said that such bodies are unlikely to survive as effective instruments ina world from which reasonable security is absent.18. Just as there are special functional organisations, so there may beregional associations for various purposes when there is obvious advantage to beobtained by limitation of the sphere of action. Such regional associations might come into existence for security, for economic co-operation, for the promotion of welfare in colonial territories or for other purposes. It is, however, essential thatthey should not conflict with the world-wide organisation but rather assist it tocarry out its purposes.III. Constitution of the Organisation.19. It is generally recognised that it will be necessary to set up two mainbodies, one as a centre of discussion on which all States are represented and theother, a smaller body, as a centre of action. It is suggested that these bodies be termed the World Assembly and the World Council respectively.20. Membership. It is assumed that at the outset all the United nations will be invited to be members of the Organisation. What States now neutral shallbe admitted and at what period is a matter for consideration. The enemy Statescannot be admitted until they have shown by their conduct that they accept theob jects of the organisation and intend to pursue them.
21. All the members of the organisation should share in some manner in the admission of new members. It will have to be considered how far it is necessaryto lay down conditions under which a State shall cease to be a member of theOrganisation.22. World Assembly. The sovereign equality of all members should berecognised by their representatives meeting together on a footing of equality in a&quot;World Assembly at least once a year. The right of information and criticismshould belong to all members of the organisation.23. It is not suggested that this body should have all the powers that werepossessed by the Assembly of the League. The specialised and technical bodiesshould undertake some of the duties which that body performed and the initiative in preventing breaches of the peace should lie with: the World Council.24. It is a matter for consideration whether the World Assembly shouldhave the control over finance and the admission of new members which theAssembly of the League possessed; but it is suggested that the States cannot beexpected to contribute to the finances of an organisation without some share intheir determination, nor to belong to a society to which other States may beadmitted without consultation with them.25. World Council. This body should be sufficiently small and compact toensure action and of such a character as to possess the confidence of all membersof the organisation.26. The constitution of this body raises many difficult problems. the relation between the Great Powers and other States have been matter of disputefor over a century. The principle has been generally accepted that where theinterests of any State are specially affected it should have the right of represen-tation on the Council. It is also clearly necessary that the Four Powers, whichbetween them are directly responsible for the peace and security of nearly two-thirds of the world&apos;s inhabitants, should always be represented on it.27. The number and method of representation of other States is a matter for grave consideration and the manner in which the decisions of the council shall be made may depend on the method adopted. The object should be to ensurethat the other States on the World Council command general confidence. some form of election is probably essential.and the World Assembly can obviously.beused for this purpose.28. Some means must be found to ensure that the various regions of theworld are adequately represented. The size and area of States vary so greatlyand are so unevenly distributed over the Continents that some agreement on thissubject is essential. Thus, the Caribbean area has more independent States thanall the rest of Latin America, which includes Brazil, Argentina and Chile. BothEurope and South America have many more States than North America or Asia.Hitherto States as different in. power and status as Canada and Panama havehad equal rights of representation. The principle of rotation has deprived theCouncil of experienced statesmen, while the creation of &quot; semi-permanent &quot; &quot;seatswas much resented by some of the States that did not enjoy the privilege.29. If the principle which governs the election of the Governing Body ofthe I.L.O. could be accepted, a more satisfactory result might be obtained, butit is difficult to find the principle to apply to a political body.30. Should Regional Associations of sufficient importance be formed theymight furnish a basis for representation on the Council. But for the most partStates do not recognise other States as &quot; representing &quot; them on institutions inwhich they have a major interest.31. It is clear that this subject will need, careful examination not onlyamongst the Four Powers themselves but with the other States whose wishes mustbe taken into account.32. The main function of the World Council will be to ensure such inter-course between the statesmen of the countries represented on it as to enable themto secure solutions of international problems by discussion and co-operativeaction. For this purpose regular meetings with an appropriate procedure andsecretariat are indispensable. No other single factor is likely to be so influentialin producing harmony between the policies of States. The experience of the lastthirty years shows that there is no adequate substitute for it.
33. The functions suggested for the World Council as the body responsiblefor the peace of the world are described in Memorandum B.34. It will also be necessary for the World Council to give some commondirection to the functional bodies.   This question is considered in Memo. D.35. In general it is hoped that the Council may become a centre whereGovernments reconcile their attitudes towards major international problems so asto be able to act decisively towards a common end.38. Permanent Court of International Justice. It is assumed that therewill be general agreement that a Permanent Court of International Justice willbe set up. The proposals of the Informal Inter-Allied Committee which recently reported on this question seem to indicate the general lines that should befollowed.37. Secretariat. A permanent secretariat will be indispensable. Theexperience of the League of Nations and the I.L.O. should be utilised. It is assumed, however, that a number of new specialised technical bodies will comeinto existence. Further consideration of this question might, therefore, awaitmore definite information concerning them.38. The suggestion that the head of the Secretariat should be given theright of bringing before the World Council any matter which in his opinionthreatens the peace of the world might well be incorporated in the rules of theOrganisation.39. Specialised and Technical Organisations. This question is considered in Memorandum D. The position of the International Labour Organisation will need special consideration.40. Seat of the Organisation.- This problem should be left open until further information is available on the number and character of the functionalorganisations.41. Name of the Organisation. The term &quot;United Nations&quot; is now ingeneral use and there does not seem to be any strong reason to substitute any other for it.
SECRET.Memorandum B.THE PACIFIC SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES, THE QUESTION of guarantees AND THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH action should BE TAKEN FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF peace and SECURITY.I. Introduction.IF war is to be prevented there must be in existence a means to make those decisions which in the past have been made by violence. If an organisation isset up to achieve this end there must be some guarantee that its members will be protected should States, inside or outside it, threaten to subject them to violence.For the purpose of providing protection, action may have to be taken against anoffending State, and this necessitates some statement of how and when suchaction shall be taken.2. The maintenance of peace and security is not merely an end in itself buta means by which an ordered and progressive community of States may come into existence. The principles and objects of such a society have been indicated inPart I of Memorandum A, and it is on them that all action by the organisation should be based. A state of peace should be regarded as not simply the accept-ance of the status quo but active co-operation between States for the objects and principles of the Organisation.3. Such ends cannot be obtained by any system of procedure however skil-fully designed. Everything depends on the unity of purpose of those states which possess the greatest means of carrying out their purposes. It is impossibleto ensure that these States will always be in agreement, and no set of rules will do so. But an agreement to act under certain specific principles in a world organisation will make their co-operation easier and will enable other States tobe associated with them for their common purpose.4. If all the Great Powers are members of the Organisation and show their intention of acting in accordance with it, all States will be more ready to acceptthe responsibilities commensurate with their power. The absence of the UnitedStates and, for a long period, of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics fromthe League of Nations caused the United Kingdom to review its responsibilities.For the same reason smaller States were often reluctant to accept full responsi-bility.5. For the same reason also there was great anxiety on the part of manyStates to define very closely the occasion for action by the organs and membersof the League of Nations. As is explained below, this attempt failed in its pur-pose. Moreover, public opinion did not understand the elaborate safeguards against arbitrary action that existed. It is suggested that the methods embodied in the constitution of the Organisation should be simple and flexible. They shouldbe extended and elaborated only as the result of experience.6. It is believed also that, whatever procedure be adopted, it is only by setting up some definite security system such as is suggested in Memorandum Cthat reality will be given to the promises made and that the States of the worldwill come to believe that by accepting the rights and responsibilities given tothem by the Organisation they will be spared such sufferings as they are nowenduring.II. The Pacific Settlement of Disputes.7. Disputes between States are divided into two main categories, those,often termed &quot; justiciable,&quot; that can be settled by a legal tribunal, and those inwhich other considerations are predominant.
8. It is the second class which produces the most intractable and dangerousdisputes, including those in which the legal position is entirely clear. In thepast, States have promised not to attempt settlement of their disputes by violentmeans, but they have not promised to settle their disputes. It is suggested thatit might be well if they now promised to &apos;&apos; settle &apos;&apos; their disputes in the sense that they will not allow them to endanger peace and security.9. Justiciable Disputes. It would seem that there is likely to be generalagreement that justiciable disputes should be generally settled by a PermanentCourt of International Justice. The Informal Inter-Allied Committee suggestedin its recent report that the Court be open to all States, whether they acceptcompulsory jurisdiction or not. It would be possible for the international organisation to make the acceptance of such an obligation a condition of member-ship, but in such a case it would be necessary to allow States to make certainreservations.10. The difference between accepting compulsory jurisdiction with reserva-tions and retaining full freedom of action is likely to have more psychologicalthan practical effect, especially if the World Council can obtain AdvisoryOpinions from the Court on some point in a dispute, which has been submittedto it.11. Other Disputes. Reference to the World Council is the obvious methodof dealing with other disputes. Though other elaborate methods of conciliationhave been set up they have hardly ever been used and they have the disadvantage of placing the case in the hands of persons who are not responsible for the conse-quences of failure to preserve peace. It is only in the World Council itself thata body of rules and a technique of procedure can be gradually established as theresult of accumulated experience.12. It should be for the World Council to decide what method should beused for dealing with the dispute. Any decision of this nature should be regardedas a decision of procedure and consequently be adopted by a majority vote.13. There have been suggestions that even on questions of principle (as opposed to questions of procedure) decisions should be taken by (say) a two-thirds majority of the Council rather than by unanimity. We leave this important question open, but it seems desirable that in all such cases all the Four powers should be included in the majority. In any event, the votes of the parties to thedispute should not, of course, be taken into account.14. States are not likely to bind themselves to accept the decision of theCouncil in all cases. Nor would it be likely that they would undertake theobligation to enforce it on other States in all cases. But it would still bethe function of the World Council to see that disputes did not threaten peace and security and for the other States to co-operate with it to the utmost of their power for that purpose, so that there would still be large opportunities for action todeal with even the most difficult disputes.15. For, as has been indicated, if peace and security are to be maintained,some method must be devised, for the settlement of all disputes between States.&quot; Settlement &quot; in this sense may, as is often the case in domestic disputes, showthat no remedy exists for a legitimate grievance. But if States promise to&quot; settle &quot; their disputes in the sense defined in paragraph 8 above, the balance is thrown more in the direction of change. The status quo is sufficiently safe-guarded by the mere existence of a universal system for the maintenance of peace and security. Should the dispute be such as to threaten peace and security, itwill be for the World Council (and in such cases action will depend largely onthe Great Powers) to decide what action should be taken to deal with it.16. If the dispute involves the Great Powers themselves the machinery for decision may prove inadequate; but there is hope that the habit of co-operativeleadership in the settlement of other disputes and the restraints imposed by theirown promises to one another and to other States may suffice to achieve a settle-ment, even where the machinery seems to be inadequate to do so. Much will depend on whether a sufficient number of States, great and small, come to attachso much importance to the preservation of the system that they are prepared to run risks and make sacrifices to support and preserve it.17. There was considerable agreement in the period between the two warsthat the vague words of Article XIX of the Covenant of the League of Nationswere hardly a sufficient recognition of the fact that there must be a change in
the.world. When, in the thirties, it was perceived that there was no greatdesire in some countries to go to war to defend some of the frontiers erected bythe Peace Treaties, there was much discussion of a process which became knownas &quot;Peaceful Change.&quot; Examination of this concept shows that it cannot beobtained by a clause in a Covenant, but can only be a continual process achieved through discussion and compromise between the Great Powers and, in their dueplace, the smaller States concerned. But it is essential that such a process be guided by principle and subject to an ordered procedure, and it is necessary,therefore, that it should take place within an international organisation.18. It may be hoped that the international functional organisations whichare being brought into existence will contribute to furthering the process of peaceful change in an orderly manner.III. -The Question of Guarantees.19. In considering this question the history of the guarantees given in theCovenant of the League of Nations must be taken into account, since it throwsgreat light on the nature of the problem. For by Article X the Members of theLeague &quot;undertook to respect and preserve as against external aggression theterritorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members.&quot; Theformula had first been devised by President Wilson for the Western Hemisphereand it was at his instance that it was applied universally. No method was laiddown as to how the obligation should be carried out except that the council should &quot; advise &quot; upon the question.20. Territorial Integrity. There was much opposition to the proposedArticle, attention being concentrated on the question of &quot; territorial integrity.&quot;Lord Cecil suggested that the guarantee should be withdrawn if the state concerned refused to accept a modification of frontier desired by a large majority of the members of the League of Nations. The vague phraseology ofArticle XIX of the Covenant was all that resulted from this proposal.Mr. Lansing and Dr. Miller were also opposed to inserting Article X, though thelatter came to believe that it made little difference. Sir Robert Borden tried to abolish it before the Covenant was signed, and the Canadian Delegation renewedthe attempt at the First Assembly. In 1923 an interpretative resolution wasadopted by the Assembly (though as Persia dissented it had no legal force) whichlaid down that it was for each State to decide how it should carry out its obliga-tions under this head, while the Council was to take into account, in any advice that it might give, the geographical situation and special conditions of each State.21. In fact, Article X was hardly ever used in the disputes which came before the League of Nations. But it was constantly referred to when some Statewished to remind others that its existing frontiers were guaranteed by them. Itwas also constantly used by critics of the League of Nations to show that its members had guaranteed for all time frontiers which they possessed no legalmeans of changing without the consent of the State concerned.22. Much smaller attention has been paid to this subject in recent discussions, though there may, of course, be a shift of interest when the treatiesthat register any changes of frontier which may be made come into existence.There is, however, reason to think that many States will be more interested in theestablishment of some concrete security system ready for immediate action thanin guarantees of frontiers which in themselves do little to prevent the invasionand occupation of territory by the armed forces of another State.23. Many other States would be likely to refuse to accept an organisation which committed them to a guarantee of the territorial integrity of all States.24. It is suggested, therefore, that no such guarantee be included in theobligations undertaken by members of the Organisation.25. Political Independence. The question of &quot;political independence&quot;raises issues of a rather different character. The Moscow Declaration hasalready based the Organisation on the &quot; sovereign equality &quot; of all States, whichimplies that the Members of the Organisation will retain legal control over theirown actions except in so far as they agree by treaty to limit it. All Statesnaturally attach the highest value to their political independence, and theprincipal statesmen have made repeated declarations that they- intend to respect the independence, of other States.
26. But an undertaking to respect the political independence of other Statesdoes not necessarily involve a commitment to guarantee it. It is, moreover, not easy to define exactly what political independence is. One State may control the actions of another State by indirect means. It is impossible to distinguish theline which divides such actions from what is generally regarded as the legitimateinfluence which one State may exercise on the actions of another. The objectionto any guarantee of &apos;&apos; political independence &apos;&apos; is that it could only extend toexternal and legal forms.  It could not take into account more indirect methods.27. For this reason the inclusion of a guarantee of political independence in the obligations of the Organisation seems undesirable. But it should, berecognised that mutual respect for the political independence of its members is oneof the essential principles of the Organisation as already pointed out in Part 1 of memorandum A.28. The Maintenance of International Peace and Security.: By theCovenant of the League, States undertook to inflict sanctions on another state which broke its promises to submit a dispute to pacific settlement and resorted towar. It was for each State to determine its own actions after the Council (orAssembly) had declared that the occasion for action had arisen. Doubt wasconstantly expressed as to the sufficiency of this promise, though, so far as wordscan guarantee action, a definite promise was made. But the duty of enforcingaction to be taken were laid on the members.29. Also by Article XI of the Covenant the duty of safeguarding the &quot; peace of nations &quot; was laid on the League, but no specific obligations as regards theaction to be taken were laid on the Members.30. The Four Powers have already, by Article 4 of the Moscow Declaration,laid down that the main purpose of the international organisation is the &quot; main-tenance of international peace and security,&quot; and have asserted by Article 5 that&apos;&apos; they will consult with one another and, as occasion requires, with other membersof the United Nations, with a view to joint action on behalf of the community ofnations &quot; for this purpose until a system of general security is inaugurated. Itwould seem that it is along these lines that any guarantee should be given.31. The duty of co-operating to the utmost of their power in the maintenanceof international peace and security should be undertaken by all members of theOrganisation. The degree of such co-operation must obviously depend on the geographical situation of States, the amount of their resources, their own internal situation and possibly other factors which cannot be accurately weighed inadvance. But the duty of co-operating to the utmost of their power in an organisation which is essential to the peace and security of all should be laid upon all members.32. The duty of maintaining international peace and security should be laid in the first instance on the World Council acting on behalf of the other membersof the Organisation. It will be for the World Council to take the initiative togive effect to the undertaking to maintain international peace and security. Thehead of the Secretariat should, however, as suggested in para. 38 of Memo-randum A, be given the right of bringing before the World Council an*y matter which in his opinion threatened international peace and security.33. It is for consideration whether any special obligations for the main-tenance of international peace and security should be explicitly assumed withinthe permanent Organisation by the Four Powers who have undertaken such a responsibility pending the establishment of a general system.34. If regional organisations are set up for security purposes, part of theresponsibility in the first instance might fall on them, but, as is suggested in memorandum A, paragraph 18, not in such a manner as to conflict with the finalresponsibility of the World Council for the maintenance of peace and security.IV. The Conditions in which Action should be taken for the Maintenanceof Peace and Security.35. It is generally recognised that there must be some statement in theconstitution of the Organisation as to the conditions in which action is taken tomaintain international peace and security. In the Covenant of the League ofNations and in the attempts to elaborate the Covenant great attention was givento this question.
InO36. In the Covenant the sanctions of Article XVI came into force only ifthere was resort to war after a Member had broken the promises made in articles XII-XIV. Even then each State necessarily determined for itselfwhether the casus fcederis had arisen.37. In Article X the guarantees were against &quot; external aggression&quot; only.It was by this article that the unfortunate word &quot; aggression &quot; was introduced into the Covenant and became the subject of so many debates at Geneva. But themore the word was discussed the more difficult it became to define exactly what it meant. The definition of aggression was considered important because it was thought that it might affect the right of the Council to advise that sanctions beemployed. The most notable contribution to the debate was the suggestion thataggression should be determined by the acceptance or refusal of arbitration or some other peaceful method of settling disputes. But this did not cover the preparations for aggression, nor did it take the time element sufficiently intoaccount. Moreover, the discussion and analysis of aggression enabled States touse a procedure calculated to defeat the objects of the Covenant. Illustration ofthis fact was given by the Japanese attack on China in Manchuria.38. In Article XI sanctions were not mentioned, and the obligations of theCouncil were stated in the most general terms. These obligations could be interpreted as giving the right to take drastic action, but in the light of other articles it was difficult to find in them any right to use force against a State. in actual practice a number of dangerous situations that arose between small states were dealt with successfully under Article XI, and a technique which involvedsuch matters as the setting up of commissions of enquiry and the establishmentof neutral zones was gradually developed.39. In the Protocol of 1924 an attempt was made to make the sanctions&quot; automatic &quot; by setting up an elaborate set of rules. But the discussions showed that such a course was impossible. Sanctions depend upon the will of Govern-ments and peoples and cannot be automatically brought into existence.40. As has been noted above, one test of aggression is the acceptance orrefusal of some method of settling the dispute. But the acceptance may be merelya method of delay while preparations for aggression are being made (as in thecase of Italy&apos;s attack on Abyssinia) or actual force is used (as in Japan&apos;s attackon China). It can be argued that in both these cases the lack of effective action was due not to any defect in the Articles of the Covenant but to the lack of will on thepart of the other States, and notably of the Great Powers involved, to go to warwith the recalcitrant State. But it was also true that Japan was able to use herright of veto under Article XI to place obstacles in the way of the necessaryenquiry, and that preventive action against Italy, before she attacked, was difficult to take legally under the Covenant. Under the Locarno Treaties the signatory States could act without League authority in the case of &apos;&apos; flagrantaggression,&quot; but not preventively. If the question of Germany&apos;s rearmament hadbeen brought before the Council it is not easy to see what sanctions could havebeen taken against her under the Covenant.41. In actual fact there was never any doubt, in the cases in which theLeague of Nations was concerned, as to the identity of-the aggressor, thoughsometimes as to the character of the provocation to aggression. States, it is true,adapted their actions and procedure to the language and resolutions adopted atGeneva and later to the Pact of Paris. But in no case were the real intentions and motives of the aggressive States concealed from the Governmnts of the othermembers of the League or from public opinion. The discussions at the Counciland the Assembly made them sufficiently clear.42. This experience suggests that too rigid a definition of the occasion for action is as likely to hinder as to facilitate the maintenance of peace and security.If the World Council is given power to act for this purpose it will be able towork out for itself the necessary procedure in the light of experience. It willbe easier also in such circumstances to refer matters to regional associations ifany such come into existence which can be used for that purpose.43. At the same time the principles and objects governing the actions ofMembers will have been laid down in the Preamble to the document bringing theOrganisation into existence. These, as suggested in Part I of Memorandum A,should include not only the maintenance of peace and security but also respect forthe &quot;sovereign equality&quot; and &quot;political independence&quot; of its Members. If,therefore, it is laid down that the World Council shall only take action in
accordance with these principles and objects, action for other purposes will be excluded. It is suggested that States will be protected from arbitrary action bythe World Council as much by this safeguard as by elaborate definition, while theWorld Council will be more free to act to protect States from violence.V. Conclusions.44.   As to the Pacific Settlement of Disputes (i) That all States should promise to settle their disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security are notendangered.(ii) That justiciable disputes should generally be decided by a PermanentCourt of International Justice,(iii) That other disputes should be subjected to a process of discussion and conciliation in the World Council, which should have power todetermine the procedure to be followed without the consent of theparties to the dispute.45.   As to Guarantees-^(i) That all Members should undertake to co-operate to the utmost of their power in the maintenance of international peace and security, andthat the World Council should be required to take the initiative forthis purpose.(ii) That no guarantee should be given of the territorial integrity ofMembers.(iii) That no guarantee should be given of the political independence ofMembers, but that respect for it should be recognised as one of theprinciples of the organisation.46. As to the conditions in which action should be taken for the maintenanceof peace and security That there should be no attempt to lay down in advance any rigiddefinition of the occasions on which such action should be taken, but that theMembers of the Organisation and the World Council should only beempowered to take action in accordance with the principles and objects ofthe Organisation.
secret memorandum C.SECURITY.I.-THE MILITARY ASPECT OF ANY POST-WAR security organisation.1. Introduction.THE Moscow Declaration on General Security contemplates the creation,at the earliest possible date, of an international organisation charged with themaintenance of world peace and security. This organisation is to be founded on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States, and all such States are to be eligible for membership.2. An attempt is made in the present paper to sketch out the general lines on which the organisation of International Security might be attempted afterthe conclusion of the present war. The proposals deal, however, with the form which the Permanent Security Organisation might eventually take and do notrelate to the intervening period. During this last period it is evident that some temporary arrangements will have to be made, but these will be obviouslyaffected if there is some previous general agreement as to the form which thepermanent organisation might assume.2. General Considerations.Nature of the Organisation.3. The proposed world organisation, whatever-its form, is bound to failunless : (a) The United Kingdom, United States, U.S.S.R. and China continue toco-operate whole-heartedly in its support.(b) The Governments and peoples of those Powers at least retain the will to enforce peace.(c) The organisation is simple, its objects are clear-cut, and the machinery is of a kind to which member States are already accustomed.The Objects.4.   The objects should be : (a) To disarm Germany and Japan;(&amp;) To keep them disarmed; and(c) To prevent them or any other aggressor from again upsetting the peace of the world.The Means.5. The proposed organisation will have to rely, in the main, on the combined military forces of the United Nations and, in particular, of the four powers, working together to a common end. Most of the States concerned are already accustomed to such a system.6. Economic measures, also, may operate to deter potential aggressors,but unless backed by force or the effective threat of it are unlikely to prove anadequate check on a State which is, itself, ready to resort to force.The Idea of an &quot; International Police Force.&quot;7. In some quarters it is contended that the co-ordination of military forces could best be expressed in a completely international &quot; Police Force.&quot; whatever its theoretical merits, this postulates a greater advance in international co--operation than States are yet prepared to make, as it implies the existenceof a world State.  Practical questions of size, composition, maintenance, location
and command would give rise to controversies on which international agreement would almost certainly be unobtainable.8. We conclude that the time has not yet come for the creation of suchan international force.3. Proposals.Higher Military Organisation.9. The proposed world organisation implies the existence of some sort of world Council. This Council will need military advice, and this advice willhave to be given by States, not individually, but in concert. Apart from the&quot; strategic &quot; side of the work, e.g., the preparation of plans to resist potentialaggression, there are a number of general questions such as the regulation ofarmaments on which combined military advice will be required.10. If the Higher Military Organisation is to advise the World Counciland provide machinery whereby plans can be made in advance and the efforts of the forces of member States co-ordinated, it follows that it must form partof, and receive directions from, the World Council.11. It thus becomes clear that there will have to be a Military staff committee serving the World Council.iComposition of the Military Staff Committee.12. Since for many years to come the Four Powers will have to play the predominant part in safeguarding world peace, the permanent members of thisCommittee should be the military representatives of those Powers. Theco-operation of States other than the Four Powers will, however, be essential in providing forces and making available bases, shipping and other facilities,and these States will expect to be given a voice corresponding to their obligations.These States should therefore be associated in some form or other with the workof the Military Staff Committee. The form Avhich this association should takeraises difficult problems, and must depend to a considerable extent on the form which the World Council itself takes. As a beginning, the Committee mightbe strengthened, when dealing Avith particular security problems, by the additionof military representatives of States having special concern with the question under discussion.13. It is important that the members of the World Council should not receivemilitary advice from more than one source. It is therefore essential that themembers of the Military Staff Committee should be the supreme militaryauthorities in their own countries or their representatives.Functions of the Military Staff Committee.14. The primary duty of the Committee would be to prepare and keep up to date plans for the prevention of any renewed aggression by Germany orJapan, or by any other State which might at any time give signs of becomingan aggressor. The Committee would also be responsible for any necessaryco-ordination of the national forces of the member States.Force at the Disposal of the World Council.15. The World Council would dispose of the aggregate of the national forces which member States were prepared to place at its disposal for the purposeof resisting aggression. On an emergency arising, it Avould be for the world council, on the advice of the Military Staff Committee, to decide what proportionof the forces at its disposal would be needed to deal with the situation.16. The mere existence of national forces and their availability in emergency would not, however, by itself, suffice to ensure the maintenance of security, even if plans for their employment were made in advance by the MilitaryStaff Committee. It would be essential that these forces should have workedtogether in time of peace if their co-operation were to be smooth and efficientin time of emergency. In this connection it is difficult to exaggerate the psychological effect of constant co-operation.
Co-operation between Forces of Different States.17.   In time of peace co-operation could best be fostered (a) by the joint garrisoning or occupation of certain areas; and(&amp;) by means of joint cruises and flights, and other joint exercises.There are a number of areas which a more detailed study may show to be suitable for joint occupation. The Kiel Canal area is a case in point. As regardsjoint exercises, it is desirable that displays of force should periodically be madewith the object of impressing would-be aggressors.18. The rights and facilities necessary for joint garrisoning or occupation,joint exercises and joint access to ports and airfields would have to be secured by agreement between member States and, where necessary, by express provisions in the peace treaties with ex-enemy States. The question of bases is very complicated and is dealt with in Part B of this paper.4. Regions.19. There is considerable support for the suggestion that, for purposes ofan international security system, the world should be divided into fixed regions,each containing forces which, under the supreme control of a World Council,would be responsible for preventing aggression in that region. It has beenargued that such an arrangement would limit the military commitments of thesmaller States and increase efficiency and rapidity of action.20. Prom a military point of view, there are certain objections to a world organisation constructed on a basis of separate regions. These objections maybe stated as follows : (a) It is impossible to draw a boundary of a region so as to confine within it all military operations which the member States in that regionmight have to undertake.(b) If an attempt were made to fix the operational boundary of a region,States on the perimeter would necessarily form part of the neighbour-ing geographical region. Thus neighbouring regions would overlapextensively.(c) The defence arrangements of some Powers are based primarily on sea and air power, which do not lend themselves to regionalisation.The advantages of regional organisation may be summarised as follows : (a) The main attraction of a regional political organisation is that it wouldgive the smaller nations a more direct concern in security problems,and so encourage their co-operation in security measures, thus reducing the burden on the Four Powers.(b) Regional organisation might increase the efficiency and rapidity of both political and military action by member States of the region.(c) A regional organisation, through its attached military staff, would facilitate military co-operation between the States concerned.21. An argument in favour of the proposals contained in this paper is thatthe suggested military organisation is not dependent on the existence of regionalpolitical councils, yet could be adapted to a regional system if the latter proveddesirable on political grounds. In such a case the Military Staff Committee would serve to co-ordinate the activities of the military staffs attached to the regional organisations.5, Conclusions.22.   Our conclusions, therefore, are as follows : (a) Any complete international &apos;&apos; Police Force &apos;&apos; is impracticable in presentcircumstances.(&amp;) The success of any world security organisation depends on the whole-hearted co-operation of the principal member States and on theirresolution to use force to prevent aggression.(c) The object, in the first instance, of any world security organisation shouldbe the prevention of renewed aggression by Germany and Japan.-(d)&apos; Forces for this purpose would have to be placed by member States at thedisposal of the organisation as requisite.(e) Military advice and direction would be afforded to such World council as may be set up by a military staff composed of the supreme militaryauthorities of appropriate member States or their representatives.[273271 d
(/) National forces associated for the above purpose should train and work together in peace to the greatest possible extent.(g) There would be some military difficulty in the division of the worldfor security purposes into fixed geographical regions, but, if RegionalPolitical Councils were set up as part of some world organisation,it would follow that they should have Military Advisory Staffs, andthis might facilitate local co-operation.Note. It will be noticed that the system proposed above differs fromthe system which existed prior to the war in the following three main points : (a) The establishment of an effective Military Staff Committee of the world council with power to formulate plans and to co-ordinate the actionof national forces prior to any emergency which may necessitate their action.(&apos;&amp;) The joint garrisoning of certain areas by combined detachments ofnational forces.(c) The training and exercising together of national forces in peace-time,making use of certain specified seaports and airfields.II. &quot; UNITED NATIONS BASES&quot; IN RELATION TO A general security ORGANISATION.Introduction.1. In the Atlantic Charter and in conversations which have taken place between the Prime Minister, the President of the United States, Mr. CordellHull and others, reference has been made to a general security organisation andthe idea of some form of United Nations or joint bases.2. For the purpose of any future discussions which may take place it isimportant that we should, have a clear idea of (a) the meaning we intend to convey when talking about United Nationsbases;(b) the policy it would be in the general interest to adopt in regard to theestablishment of such bases.3. These two points are dealt with in this paper. The term &quot;united nations &quot; when it is used is meant to include those nations co-operating together in any security system which may be inaugurated.Definition of United Nations Base.4. By the term &quot; base &quot; we mean an area which is organised or can quicklybe organised to enable armed forces to operate from it.5. A &quot; United Nations base&quot; may be defined as a base designed and developed for use in peace and war, or in war only, by the armed forces of oneor more States participating in any general or regional security system organised by the United Nations.Common use of a United Nations Base.6. In discussing the subject of bases it is necessary to bear in mind the distinction between the organisation of&apos; the base itself and the mobile forces operating from the base. As regards the latter category we discuss in the immediately following paragraphs the extent to which common use of any givenbase by the forces of different nations is practicable.The Naval Aspect.7. &quot;Naval Forces, in general, require similar base facilities whatever their nationality. The naval squadrons of different nationalities can use thesame port, its facilities being increased as necessary by means of repair and supply ships. Common use of a base, therefore, presents no insuperable difficulty, remembering, however, that modern fleets require a specialisedorganisation for their maintenance, the requirements for which have to he metbefore a base can be considered fully efficient.
The Army Aspect.8. The base facilities for the maintenance and operation of armies aregenerally similar whatever the nationality of the force. They include such things as disembarkation and storage facilities, workshops, &amp;c. For effectiveadministration certain installations must be established on a national basis, butthere is no objection to others being open to common use so far as is practicable in each particular case. The armies of different nations should have nodifficulty in operating together if staff and other exercises are arranged in peace,and if individual tasks are assigned to them in operations. Common use, there-fore, presents no army difficulties.The Air Force Aspect.9. The size and nature of air forces may vary. There would be specificsquadrons for the defence of ports and airfields, but otherwise types of aircraft and numbers of squadrons operating from a common base area would vary according to circumstance. There has been little difficulty in the operation oftwo or more United Nations air forces from the same airfield, provided it hasbeen under unified control. Occasionally, and particularly where heavy air-craft are concerned, certain installations special to different types are necessary,and it is preferable wherever possible for squadrons of different nationality to operate under their own Commander and to have separate airfields and accom-modation.Conclusion.10. We conclude, therefore, that there is no inherent difficulty in theoperation of the armed forces of different nationalities from the same base, butthat the best results will be obtained in practice by restricting the forces operating from any given base to as few nationalities as possible.Nature and Organisation of United Nations Bases.11.   The exact nature of a base is likely to vary from-(a) a fully developed base for sea, land and air forces with full facilities,adequate defences and a permanent garrison, to(b) a number of bare airfields with no facilities or an emergency anchoragewith limited resources. In cases such as these personnel permanentlyemployed, if any, would probably be limited to care and maintenanceparties.12. The immediate defence of a base is in reality one task. In course oftime, possibly, contingents of different nationality could be moulded into a singledefensive system; but the efficiency of such a system will generally be less thanone in which all the component parts are of one nationality. This difficulty would be lessened if all forces speak the same language. Supply is bound to be complicated by the differing needs of separate nationalities, even allowing forthe possibility of common use of certain items of equipment. Division ofresponsibility for costs is likely to be a further stumbling-block. Each nationwill naturally wish to avoid unnecessary expenditure. Every item involving anincrease in cost will have to be agreed between all the nations concerned, and islikely to be resisted by those whose interests do not appear to be directly affected.This will be a fruitful cause of friction and will probably result in the base beinginadequately organised.13. The conclusion seems to be that, in principle, it is desirable that basesshould be organised and defended by one nation, which should be the nationprincipally concerned in the use of the base, and which would be responsible for providing facilities for other nations.Types of Bases.14. Within any security system there are two main purposes for which united Nations bases may be required, viz. -(a) a base established for the control of ex-enemy States; and(b) one selected and organised for the purpose of maintaining general security.
15. For whichever of these purposes a base is required, however, weconsider that it will fall within one of the following four general categories,subject, perhaps, to slight modification in particular cases : Type A. The Base remains under national sovereignty of the owner andthe facilities are provided on behalf of the United Nations by that State, e.g., thepresent system whereby certain airfields in the United Kingdom are placed atthe disposal of the United States.Type B. The Base is obtained by lease or agreement by one State from another, the former maintaining the installations on behalf of the united nations.  American bases in the British West Indies are of this nature.Type C. The Base is obtained by lease or agreement by one State from another and both participants share in the organisation and in the maintenanceof the installations. Such bases might be established, for instance, in thecountries of the Middle East and the Mediterranean.Type D. A base established by one or more Nations, under the authority ofthe United Nations, on territory other than their own; the Nations establishing the base acting as Trustees. A base of this type might be established in the KielCanal area for control purposes.
SECRET.Memorandum D.CO-ORDINATION OF POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC international machinery.THERE will inevitably be set up, as part of the permanent international system, a number of specialised international bodies dealing with economic and social questions. Some of these bodies have already been considered inconsiderable detail, e.g., the Permanent Organisation for Food and Agriculture.Others are in earlier stages of development. There are already in existence thetechnical organisations attached to the League of Nations, such as those which deal with Health, the abolition of the Drug Traffic, Transport, &amp;c.2.   It will be necessary to make provision (a) To co-ordinate the activities of these bodies on their technical side.(b) To bring them into relation with the World Organisation.3. The obvious methods by which these objects can be achieved are by meansof discussions both between the specialised organisations themselves and in theworld organisation, and by means of an economic and social secretariat attachedto the World Council.4. No doubt some form of consultation will be arranged between the specialised bodies themselves so that their activities may be directed towards acommon end. This co-ordination will be assisted by the existence of an economicand social secretariat attached to the World Council. The specialised inter-national bodies should also have the obligation of sending reports to the world organisation as well as to their constituent members. These reports can beconsidered and discussed in the World Organisation, so far as it is desirable todo so, in order to facilitate co-operation between &quot;the specialised bodies and themaintenance of international peace and security.5. These discussions will be assisted by the existence of an economic and social secretariat attached to the World Council, and these may thus come into being for economic and social questions as equivalent to the machinery which(see Memorandum A, paragraph 38), will, it is hoped, be in existence for politicalquestions.

SECRET.Memorandum E.METHOD AND  PROCEDURE  FOR ESTABLISHING A world organisation.IT may be hoped that the exchange of memoranda and preliminary discus-sions between the three Powers will result in a considerable measure of agreement.The question thus arises how such agreement shall be recorded, in what form itshall be submitted to the three Governments for their approval, and how and whenthe views of the other United Nations shall be obtained.2. In Article 4 of the Moscow Declaration the Four Powers recognised thenecessity of establishing an international organisation &quot; at the earliest practicabledate,&quot; and an obligation lies on them to make every effort to fulfil this promise.3. Moreover, if agreement can be obtained between the United Nations on adefinite scheme to maintain international peace and security a new hope will arise in the world which may do much to render less difficult the painful process of reconstruction. The reception of the Moscow Declaration by public opinion show show anxious the world is to receive some assurance that such a scheme is ready for adoption.4. There appear to be considerable advantages in obtaining at the earliestpossible moment agreement on the essentials of the permanent international organisation, leaving the more detailed working out of its several parts to a later stage.5. If it is decided to set up any regional associations in any part of theworld it will be much easier to fashion them in accordance with a general planafter the outline of the World Organisation has been determined.6. Moreover, the existence of such an agreement-will facilitate negotiationfor the establishment of specialised and technical bodies. It will also make possible the adaptation of such parts of the temporary machinery set up imme-diately after the war as it is desired to incorporate in the permanent Organisation.7. In the Moscow Declaration the Four Powers have assumed a respon-sibility for the maintenance of peace and security pending the establishment ofa general system of security. This duty is likely to be less onerous if the other united Nations, and possibly States now neutral, are associated with the four powers for that purpose at the earliest possible date. In this way the new per-manent Organisation will more quickly become a reality and take its properposition in the new world community.8. Moreover, the Treaties of Peace will be more easily made if the form and character of the new permanent organisation are already known. Solutions ofdifficult problems will be more easily found and there is less likelihood of decisionsbeing made which are incompatible with the terms of the permanent organisation.9. It is suggested, therefore, that the aim of the preliminary talks atWashington should be to reach such agreement as can be referred to the three governments in the form of a Draft Declaration, similar to that signed at Moscowbut containing in its several clauses a more extended survey of the objects and principles of the permanent International Organisation and an outline of themachinery which it is proposed to set up to obtain them.10. It may be necessary to omit from the draft Declaration many importantparticulars, e.g., the exact methods by which the members of the World council are chosen and their number. Some of these points may perhaps be left to the new organisation itself to determine. But it may be hoped that agreement may beobtained on what political bodies shall be set up, e.g., a World Assembly, a world council and a World Court; on the principles on which action will be taken forthe pacific settlement of disputes and the maintenance of international peace and security; on-the necessity for agreeing some permanent method by which themilitary forces necessary to maintain international peace and security can be
co-ordinated; and on the principles which shall govern the relations of the specialised organisations with one another and with the World Council and world Assembly.11. It will then be for the Governments of the three Powers to determinehow far they can approve the draft Declaration and it may be necessary to havea more formal exchange of views between them for this purpose.12. If agreement is thus obtained it will be necessary to communicate it tothe other United Nations for consideration, and immediately thereafter to publishit. After a suitable interval the United Nations would be invited to attend aConference at which the Declaration, with such amendments as had been found desirable, would be definitely adopted.13. It should then be possible to set up a body to work out a more detailedinstrument in the form of a Convention or Treaty on the lines of the Declaration.It would be the coming into force of this instrument, after the ordinary procedurerequired for ratification, which would bring the Permanent Organisation into existence. The exact date on which it was put into force might well be left to bedetermined by the Four Powers who are specially responsible for the maintenanceof international peace and security in the interim period.14. This method would have the advantage that, while the permanent organisation can, of course, only be brought into existence with the full consentof the Governments concerned after they have consulted the peoples which they represent, its form and character will have been to a large extent decided in con-sequence of the adoption of the Declaration. Many of the Governments of theUnited Nations might find it impossible to sign a treaty at that stage. Some ofthem may not survive the transition from war to peace. But many of them couldrecord their agreement to a Declaration of the kind described and so prepare theway for themselves or their successors to take part in the preparation andsignature of the final instrument.
APPENDIX.Comments on Memorandum &quot;C,&quot; pp. 16 and 17.Paragraph 15.1. The A.P.W. Committee feel that the first sentence of this paragraphis somewhat ambiguous. In their view, it would be highly desirable for member states to earmark certain specific forces as being immediately at the disposalof the World Council. They recognise that in a major crisis it would be necessaryfor the member States to go further, and if necessary exert their full force.Nevertheless, the small contingents which would be primarily earmarked might prove extremely useful for dealing with small disputes. They would also enablethe smaller nations to take a continuous and active part in the furtherance of world security. The action of the various earmarked forces might, of course,have to be confined to their own regions.2. The first sentence of paragraph 15, as now drafted, makes it appear thatthe scheme only contemplates the placing of forces at the disposal of the world council when an emergency arises. The A.P.W. Committee consider that the sentence should be somewhat expanded and that paragraph 15 should be redraftedas follows : 1&quot; 15. It is contemplated that member States would earmark certainforces which would always be at the disposal of the World Council, and ready at short notice to support the Council&apos;s decision. In addition, theWorld Council could dispose of the aggregate of such further forces asmember States were prepared to place at its disposal- it being recognisedthat in major disputes the full strength of States might have to be exerted.On an emergency arising, it would be for the World Council, on the advice of the Military Staff Committee, to decide what proportion of the forcesat its disposal would be needed to deal with the situation.&quot;Paragraph 22(d).3. The A.P.W. Committee raise two points on this paragraph. First, thewords &apos;&apos; for this purpose &apos;&apos; appear to refer only to (c) immediately above, whereas(d) should have wider application. Secondly, the words &quot; as requisite &quot; appearto be open to the same objection as paragraph 15.4.   The following revised (d) would make the matter clear : &quot; id) Forces to support the World Council would have to be placed bymember States at its disposal in the manner contemplated in para-graph 15.&quot;5. These proposals have been referred to the Vice-Chiefs of Staff, whohave expressed themselves as unwilling to agree to them without furtherconsideration of their implications. Their considered views will be given tothe War Cabinet when this paper is brought up for discussion.
