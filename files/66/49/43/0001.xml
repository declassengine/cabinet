^Vx-J.&apos; ^j^jtj-if. ( E - Q-(2.wtTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ^    J18Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.SECRET. / Copy No.     &amp;W.P. (44) 243.6th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED GIFT OF WARSHIPS TO SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THE Admiralty have recently sought the views of the United kingdom high Commissioner in the Union of.South Africa and the Commander-in-Chief,South Atlantic, on the&quot; advisability of asking the Union Government whether theywould agree to increase recruitment into the South African Naval Forces, witha view to taking over entirely a number of escort vessels operating in the south atlantic and Indian Ocean.2. The High Commissioner was asked whether such an approach wouldhave more chance of success it it were accompanied by the offer to South africa as a gift of, say, two or three Corvettes or Frigates.3. The replies from the High Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief havemade it clear that South Africa is herself experiencing man-power difficulties,but that the Union Government would probably entertain a proposal to man twoor three corvettes or frigates. This offer would, however, be likely to be acceptedmore quickly and readily if it were accompanied by an offer of the vessels asa gift. t4. It seems unlikely that increased naval recruitment would reduce thenumber of volunteers for the two other South African Defence Services.Although, of course, I have as yet no indication of what number of volunteersmight be forthcoming, I had in mind to mention to General Smuts a possible3-4,000 men in twelve months. .   -5. There are, at present, nearly 3,000 South African officers and men serving in H.M. Ships, and any offer of ships to South Africa would probablyentail the withdrawal of certain useful officers and ratings. I should, however,be prepared to accept such a limited withdrawal if it would encourage SouthAfrican Naval recruiting, and I ask the War Cabinefs approval to my making an offer of ships as described above to General Smuts during his visit to thisI country, as part of a general approach on the lines set out above.6. While the immediate purpose of the offer would be to gain SouthAfrican man-power assistance, there is an issue of even greater importance,namely, the encouragement of South Africa to build up her own naval force.There has recently been considerable interest in South Africa on this score, anda Union Government Committee has recommended the establishment of a south African Naval College. This Committee has suggested that South africa should eventually build up a minimum naval force of 8 Fleet minesweepers,4 Frigate type escort vessels and various small craft. Clearly, the foundations of such a force should be laid in wartime. The High Commissioner, advises thatit is most unlikely that the Union Government would contemplate the establish-merit of a larger force and its maintenance in peace time.7,   While it is clear that the above force would be primarily for local defence, I consider that the gift of escort vessels would not only be a first step towards its establishment, but also towards encouraging the conception of[27419]
South African responsibility for trade defence in South African. waters. Atthe same time, it would be made clear that this offer does not commit us to giving further ships to South Africa free of cost.8. Even should General Smuts not feel able to promise increased SouthAfrican recruiting, I still consider that the offer of escort vessels as a free giftshould be left open, and that it should be suggested that these vessels should eventually be manned by such South African personnel as could be released from service in the Royal Navy. The total number of escorts in service would not ofcourse thereby be increased.A. V. A.Admiralty, S.W. 1,6th May, 1944.
