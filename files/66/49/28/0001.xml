THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTV.*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.109SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 228.27^ April, 1944.WAR CABINET.INDIAN FOOD SITUATION.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. The War Cabinet at its Meeting on the 24th April (W.M. (44) 55th Con-elusions) appointed a Committee under my chairmanship, consisting of theMinister of Production, the Secretary of State for India, the Secretary of Statefor War, the Minister of War Transport, the Paymaster-General and Sir FirozKhan Noon, to prepare the draft of a communication from the Prime Minister to president Roosevelt about the Indian Food Situation and to report within aweek&apos;s time.Our instructions were (1) That the Prime Minister would represent to the President the situationwhich had arisen from the Bombay explosion, with such additionaldetail in regard to the generally threatening character of the Indianfood situation and its possible effect on operations, as was thought desirable at this stage. He would urge them to assist us with shipping,on the understanding, however, that any help given would be additional to, and would not come out of, the shipping already allocated to us,and would not be made in such a way as to reduce the United kingdom import programme.(2) That the replacement of the 45,000 tons of grain lost in the Bombayexplosion should be regarded as an obligation which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment must meet even if the American response was negative.2. At our meeting on the 26th April we were informed by the Secretary ofState for India that since the meeting of the Cabinet on the 24th April (a) The estimate of the amount of grain lost in the Bombay explosion had now been reduced from 45,000 to 36,500 tons. The Viceroy had beenasked to give a final figure (which might be lower still) with as little delay as possible.(b) Arrangements are being&apos; made to replace the grain lost from existingreserves in India.3. After a full review of the situation we are of opinion, in these changed circumstances, that there would no longer be advantage in approaching thePresident primarily on the narrow issue of the losses in the Bombay explosion.We feel, at the same time, given the views expressed by the Viceroy in histelegrams as to the seriousness of the Indian food situation, that there is a strong-case for asking the President to help us with shipping to carry grain to India.We recommend, in these circumstances, that the approach to the President shouldbe based on the seriousness of the Indian food situation as a whole, and I attachfor the consideration of the War Cabinet the draft of a telegram from the PrimeMinister on these lines. We&apos; regard the terms of that telegram as protectingsufficiently the instructions given to us that any help given by the United states should be additional to, and should not come out of, the shipping alreadyallocated to the United Kingdom, and that it should not be made in such a way as to reduce the United Kingdom import programme.H. M.Home Office, S.W.1.27th April, 1944[27357]
draft Telegram from the Prime Minister to President Roosevelt.I am seriously concerned about the food situation in India and its possible reactions on our joint operations. Last year we had a grievous famine in Bengal.This year there is a good crop of rice, but we are faced with an acute shortageof wheat, aggravated by unprecedented storms which have inflicted serious damage on our spring crops. Our shortage cannot be overcome, by any possiblesurplus of rice even if such a surplus could be extracted from the peasants. our recent losses in the Bombay explosion have accentuated the problem.Wavell is exceedingly anxious about our position and has given me the gravest warnings. His present estimate is that lie will require imports of about1 million tons this year if he is to hold the situation, and to meet the needs ofthe United States and British and Indian troops and of the civil population,especially in the great cities.By cutting down military shipments and other means, I have been able toarrange for 350,000 tons of wheat to be shipped to India from Australia the shortest haul during the first nine months of 1944. I cannot see my way todo more.I have had much hesitation in asking you to add to the great assistanceyou are giving us with shipping, but a satisfactory situation in India is of suchvital importance to the success of our joint plans against the Japanese that I amimpelled to ask you to consider a special allocation of ships to carry wheat toIndia from Australia without reducing the assistance you are now providingfor us. We have the wheat (in Australia) but we lack the ships, I have resistedfor some time the Viceroy&apos;s request that I should ask you for your help, but Ibelieve that, with this recent misfortune to the wheat harvest, I am no longerjustified in not asking for your help. Wavell is doing all he can by special measures in India. If, however, he should find it possible to revise his estimateof his needs, I would let you know immediately.
