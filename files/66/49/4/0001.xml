NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. H.M. and allied submarines have successfully attacked enemy shipping in the North Sea, the Mediterranean and the East Indies.Four U-boats have been sunk, all by aircraft from escort-carriers, threeprobably sunk and one possibly sunk.Northern Waters.2. The naval aircraft which attacked the Tirpitz on the 3rd were flown offH.M. ships Victorious, Furious, Emperor, Searcher, Pursuer and Fencer. Theforce was under the command of the Vice-Admiral, Second Battle Squadron, inH.M.S. Anson. The 81 fighters which escorted the two waves of Barracudassilenced the German anti-aircraft guns, afloat and ashore. No enemy air opposi-tion was encountered. . The bombing was carried out at heights of 2,500 and 3,000feet and, from photographs, at least three hits with 1,600-lb. bombs and 13 with500 or 600-lb. bombs can be identified.Home Waters.3. On the night of the 5th/6th, three M.T.Bs intercepted a convoy off theDutch coast and inflicted damage by shell-fire on an armed coaster. On the night of the 10th/11th, four Norwegian M.T.Bs, in action with the covering screen of another convoy off the Dutch coast, set one E/R boat on fire and damaged a second.4. The Norwegian S/M Ula, on patrol off the southern coast of Norway,sank a 5,000-ton ship in a strongly-escorted convoy on the 4th. Two days laterUla torpedoed and probably sank a 2,500-ton ship in convoy. H.M. S/M Unshakenin the same area on the 7th probably torpedoed a 5,000-ton ship in convoy.Mediterranean.5. At Anzio, over 29,000 tons of supplies were unloaded during the weekending the 11th. Shelling of the port and anchorage was intermittent causingdamage to cranes on the quays on the night of the 3rd / 4th. Air attacks weremade on two occasions; on the 11th, torpedoes and mines were dropped in theanchorage by 22 aircraft, four of which were destroyed. Enemy positions werebombarded by H.M. destroyer Undine on the 4th and by the US. destroyerHilary P. Jones on the 9th.6. In the Western Mediterranean British and U.S. coastal forces sank anE-boat and damaged an anti-aircraft ship on the night of the 5th/6th.H.M. S/M Untiring, off the south coast of France, torpedoed a 5,000-ton ship onthe 11th and a 1,500-ton ship on the 12th. The US. destroyer Holder, whileescorting an eastbound convoy, was torpedoed by enemy aircraft off Algiers butreached port in tow.7. In the Adriatic, coastal forces captured two small schooners off MurterIsland (N.W. of Sibenik) on the night of the 4th/5th and towed them to port.H.M. destroyers Termagant and Tenacious, while patrolling the Dalmatian coast,shelled the town and harbour at Bar (60 miles S-E. of Dubrovnik) and two radarstations on the night of the 6th/7th. On the same night an M.G.B. captured a300-ton schooner off Murter Island and towed her to port.8. In the ^aegean, a British-manned caique captured two enemy caiquessouth of Mytilene during the week. H.M. S /M1 Ultor, on patrol in the southern^aegean, sank seven caiques, including one anti-submarine craft. H.M. S/MSportsman at the end of March sank a caique and a motor lighter N.E. of Kitheraby gunfire and took eight prisoners.East Indies.9. H.M. S/M Truculent, on patrol in the Straits of Malacca, sank a.3,000-ton ship carrying M.T. in an escorted convoy of three ships off the mouth of the Perak River on the 28th March. Four days later Truculent sank a200-ton ship by gunfire.10. Four Japanese cruisers with five destroyers were sighted off NatunaIsland on a south-westerly course on the 8th.
Pacific.New Guinea.11. Allied M.T.Bs sank three north-bound barges off Madang on the 4thand destroyed five others which were beached to the north-westward three days later. On the 7th, M.T.Bs shelled buildings and gun positions south of KarkarIsland (south of Madang).Bismarck Archipelago.-    12.   Allied forces occupied Pak Island (east of Los Negros) on the 9thwithout opposition.Photographic reconnaissance of Rabaul on the 10th showed only two smallcargo ships and probably less than 200 barges present.Solomons.13. On the night of the 4th/5th and also on the 6th, TJ.S. destroyers shelleda barge base in Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainville. On the 5th, M.T.Bs sanksix barges between Buka and Bougainville.Marshalls.14. U.S. forces have now occupied 11 more atolls leaving only Wotje,Maloelap, Jaluit and Milli in Japanese hands.Carolines.15. In the attack on the 30th by US. carrier-borne aircraft on Palau,25 Japanese ships, including two destroyers and five tankers, were sunk and21 ships were either damaged or sunk. A total of 160 enemy aircraft was destroyed, chiefly in combat over Palau. The U.S. fleet while returning to base&apos;bombarded Uluthi and Woleai Islands. No US. warship was damaged duringthe operations : twenty-five U.S. aircraft were lost.Philippines.16. A Japanese force, estimated to consist of five heavy cruisers, one light cruiser and four destroyers, was sighted off south-western Mindanao on the 6thheading west.Anti-Submarine Operations.17. Eighteen attacks have been reported : four by ships, 12 by carrier-borne aircraft and two by shore-based aircraft.Aircraft from H.M. ships Tracker and Activity (escort carriers) which wereescorting a convoy to North Russia sank one U-boat S.E. of Bear Island on the3rd and possibly sank another on the 1st. Aircraft from the U.S.S. Croaten(escort carrier) sank a U-boat 200 miles south of Halifax on the 7th. aircraft from the U.S.S. Guadalcanal (escort carrier) and escorting US. destroyers sank one U-boat of the 740-ton type on the night of the 8th/9th and a second on the10th N.W. of Madeira. U-boats were probably sunk by aircraft from the U.S.cruiser San Juan S.E. of Bermuda on the 1st, by H.M.S. Swale (frigate) N.W. ofthe Azores on the 6th and by a Liberator S.W. of Ascension on the 10th.Enemy Intelligence.18. Photographic reconnaissance on the 8th showed the Scheer and Nurnbergat Swinemunde and the Graf Zeppelin at Stettin. It is reported that on the28th March the Eugen, Lutzow, either the Nurnberg or Leipzig, Emden, Schlesienand Schleswig-Holstein were at Gdynia.19. There is evidence of the existence of a German 21-inch torpedo which isrun to a set range and then becomes a ground mine. It can be used by bothU-boats and E-boats, is probably electric and trackless with a maximum range ofthree miles, and has an explosive charge of 600 lbs.U-boats.20. There has been very little activity in the Atlantic. Off the Florida coastthere are thought to be two U-boats, and one or two others between New York and newfoundland.  It is considered that the recent Caribbean campaign has ended.In the Indian Ocean there is one Japanese U-boat on patrol.[27267] b
Enemy Attack on Shipping.21. Two ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during theweek. In an attack on a homeward-bound convoy a Norwegian ship was sunk and a Norwegian tanker torpedoed N.E. of the Azores.Shipping losses by enemy action during March totalled 22 ships of145,000 tons. The losses by U-boat action amounted to 20 ships (130,000 tons), ofwhich approximately one-half occurred in the Indian Ocean, although attackstook place over widely dispersed areas from the Barents Sea to the Indian Ocean.One ship in the Indian Ocean was sunk by a surface raider. No ships were sunk by enemy aircraft, but air attacks on Mediterranean convoys resulted in one shipbeing severely damaged and beached. Enemy mines caused the loss of one ship inthe Mediterranean. Marine risks accounted for the exceptionally low total of9,000 tons.Protection of Seaborne Trade.22. During the week ending the 9th, 1,059 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 369 were in ocean convoys and 690 in British coastal convoys. Three escort-carriers, 67 destroyers (including 24 U.S. destroyers)-and 89 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Five homeward-bouncl convoys, consisting of 192 ships and four outwardconvoys, consisting of 177 ships, arrived at their destinations. No ships were lost.23. During March, 19 ocean convoys of 583 ships arrived in the UnitedKingdom and 17 outward-bound convoys of 618 ships reached their destinationswithout loss. Two homeward-bound convoys, originally of 54 ships, lost two ships (including one from North Russia).In the Western Atlantic and Caribbean, 1,499 ships in 130 convoys reached their destinations without loss and one convoy, originally of five ships, lost one ship.Allied Minelaying.24. Aircraft have laid mines on a heavy scale in the western Baltic, in the heligoland Bight, off the Dutch and northern French coasts and the biscay ports. -Mines were.also laid by aircraft in the: Danube.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.25.   Aircraft are suspected of laying mines on one night off the S.W. Coast.Five mines have been destroyed during the week, all off the East Coast. the mine totals are 4,733 ground and 4,387 moored.In the ^aegean a dangerous area has been declared between Amorgos andKinaros Islands.Enemy Merchant Shipping.26. There have been four arrivals at Bilbao of the larger ore-carrying ships and three sailings. Of the smaller ships in the ore trade, varying in size from 100to 400 tons, about 16 have been active during the week.  /Reports have been received of the development of the newly-formed SpeerOrganisation in Denmark. Dutch coasters based on Emden are known to form part of this organisation and are used for supplying the whole of the frisian islands. It is also known that 416 ships are operated by Speer at variousNorwegian ports.Russian Intelligence.- r 27. The Russian Black Sea Fleet is at present estimated to consist of the battleship Sevastopol, four cruisers of 7,200-8,000 tons, three modern and two olddestroyers, two escort vessels and 26 submarines. There are also 19 minesweepersof various types, 30 M.T.Bs. and 40 patrol craft.
MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern and Central Sectors.28. The Germans claim progress in the Narva area and defensive successessouth of Pskov, east of Ostrov and south of Mogilev, but the Russians have made no reference to fighting in these areas.Koicel Tarnopol Sector. :29. Although the Russians have never claimed the encirclement of theGerman garrison at Kowel, the Germans announced that it was relieved on the5th, after being surrounded for three weeks. Tarnopol has been the scene ofbitter street fighting, as a result of which the Russians have gained control of thegreater part of the town. CTarnopol-Skala Sector.30. When the Russians succeeded in closing the Kamenets-Podolsk pocket,it was to be expected that the Germans would do their utmost to relieve theencircled forces. After bringing up reinforcements drawn partly from the west,they attacked in a south-easterly direction between Tarnopol and Stanislavdv,while the encircled formations themselves fought their way N.W. to meet therelieving forces. The Germans announced that on the 8th contact was-established, and this is now admitted by the Russians. The number of Germanswho made their escape is not known, but it seems probable that their losses were considerable and it is doubtful whether they will have been able to save much oftheir heavy equipment. zStanislavov-Jassy Sector.31. It would appear that the Russians considered the destruction of theencircled Germans less important than the continuation of their own advancesouthwards, which has made further excellent progress. They have reached the borders of Czechoslovakia, and crossing the Pruth on a wide front, have presseddown into Rumania, taking Veresti and cutting the railway west of Jassy. Theright flank of this advance is now resting on the Carpathians. .. &apos;J army-Odessa Sector.32. Between the Pruth and the Dniester the Russians are still. pressing. slowly southwards towards Chisinau. East of the Dniester the Germans have continued their forced withdrawal. On the 5th, the Russians cut the railwayOdessa-Tiraspol and later advanced to the Dnieper estuary leaving the Germanswith a bridgehead covering Tiraspol on the east bank and another at the estuaryof the river. On the 10th, the Russians-captured the great port of Odessa, andon the 12th had entered Tiraspol.,Crimea. - . .        .&apos; .&apos;,        .33. The Russians have now opened a large-scale attack on the Crimea. Onthe 10th, they reported that after a few days&apos; fighting they, had advanced 12 miles in the Perekop Isthmus and had made progress in the Sivash area. They havenow captured the railway junction of Dzhankoi, thus cutting the only railwayleading to the Kerch Peninsula from the western part of the Crimea. Attackingalso from the east, they have captured Kerch and advanced 19 miles beyond it. -General. ..34. In spite of the fact that the Germans encircled N.W. of Kamenets-Podolsk have been able to make their escape, the Russians have cause to be wellsatisfied with the week&apos;s fighting. They have reached the borders of Czeeiio-slovakia; are well into Roumania, have almost completed their, advance to theDniester between. Ribnitsa and the Black Sea, and have captured Odessa. Finallythey have broken through the German defences in the Crimea and are advancingrapidly. 1A cold spell which had set in over most of the Russian front was followed abouta week ago by heavy snowstorms from the Baltic to the Carpathians and by fairly[27267] v;- :        b2    . :
heavy rains further south. Such weather is unusual at this time of the year,and it will delay for a time the drying-out of the ground, which had previously been making good progress in the southern part of the front.Italy.Main Front.35.   Activity has been largely confined to patrolling and artillery exchanges.A Polish patrol captured an entire enemy outpost in the central sector onthe 8th and on the 10th the Italians broke up an enemy attack of companystrength.The enemy subjected our positions in Cassino to heavy mortar and shellfire during the night 8th/9th, and enemy artillery and mortar fire continuedheavier than usual against the British positions north of the town during thefollowing day. On that day New Zealand elements engaged and partiallydemolished two enemy strong points 3 miles south of Cassino. On the 10th ourartillery engaged the hotels still held by the enemy in Cassino, and also set fireto an enemy ammunition dump in the area. The position at Cassino was lastreported quiet.U.S. artillery on the 8th engaged with success a fair number of enemy tanks and SP guns one mile north of Minturno. On the same day the River Gariglianodropped 5 feet. Our barriers against floating mines placed upstream by theenemy are being increased.Bridgehead.36. There has been increased patrol and artillery activity by both sides inthe bridgehead. On the 7th strong enemy patrols supported by artillery andmortar fire attacked British positions f mile west of the Carroceta-Anzio road.The&apos; enemy patrols penetrated to our F.D.L.&apos;s but were driven off by small-armsfire. During this day, enemy artillery succeeded in destroying some 9,000 gallonsof petrol and over 200 tons of stores in the harbour area, and two ammunitiondumps were hit further inland.The enemy launched another attack with remote-controlled tanks on the 8th,which was again successfully dealt with by our artillery. On the 10th and 11thenemy parties attempted to cross the River Molletta, but were driven off withcasualties to the enemy.Latest information reports the bridgehead quiet.Yugoslavia.37. Deep snow continued to detract from the mobility of Partisan transport,so that the delivery of sea supplies from Italy through points on the coast of yugoslavia was held up.Several Partisan successes have, however, been reported during the weekand the Germans have suffered many casualties.In Bosnia, heavy fighting in the Jajce area has resulted in Mrkonjicgradchanging hands twice. At the beginning of April a strong German columncaptured the town and pressed on towards the south. Marshal Tito&apos;s forces,having thrown back this thrust, recaptured Mrkonjicgrad and repulsed, a subsequent enemy counter-attack. In Montenegro the Partisans have increased their control of communications in continued operations east of Dubrovnik. in macedonia, during the first week of April, the Partisans carried out an attack on two lead mines some 40 miles east of Skoplje. Both are reported as out of action,and in addition 60 Germans were killed and 150 Bulgars captured. In Serbiapartisan operations against German, Bulgarian and Cetnik forces west of Nishave continued. Marshal Tito&apos;s communique of the 12th reports the start of agenera!offensive in Serbia to support these operations,Greece.38. Guerrilla activity has somewhat increased. In Thessaly, on the 1st, aGreek Liaison officer wrecked a German troop train. In Macedonia, E.L.A.S.bands inflicted 38 casualties on the enemy in a stiff engagement with a Germanforce augmented by 100 Greek traitors 25 miles south-west of Salonika. InEpirus, Zervas troops have engaged the Germans south of Arta. On the Isthmusof Corinth, E.L.A.S. elements have blown up a bridge and derailed a train; theGermans executed 48 hostages in reprisal.
Burma.    (An outline map of the Upper Chindwin and Assam is included asan inset.)Arakan.39. On the Maungdaw-Buthidaung road, our troops have captured the easttunnel. The Japanese have launched several counter-attacks, but they have all been repulsed with heavy Japanese casualties. On the Kaladan River, west african troops have recaptured Kaladan village and the enemy are being clearedfrom the area immediately to the south.Chin Hills and Chindwin.40. The withdrawal of our troops from the Tiddim area towards Imphalhas been successfully completed. On the Tiddim road, rear guards are in contact with the enemy 38 miles SW. of Imphal. Further to the west, some 40 miles.W. of Imphal, a Japanese force estimated to be a regiment strong, is moving-north with the intention of cutting the track running from Silchar to the Tiddimroad.Four columns of our troops are operating eastwards in the area S.E. ofImphal, against the Japanese lines of communication which run in a north-westerly direction from the Thaungdut area.  No contacts have yet been reported.The Japanese have continued to make progress in their thrusts towardsImphal and Kohima and the road connecting these towns. On the 7th, our troops,supported by tanks, repulsed an attack on a village ten miles N.W. of Imphal,but evacuated the village later the same day. The Japanese are astride theImphal-Kohima road at points 12, 37 and 50 miles north of Imphal, and occupiedthe southern outskirts of Kohima itself. The Japanese have established a roadblock immediately west of Kohima. A Japanese infiltration into one sector ofour positions at Kohima has been eliminated. A large number of Japanese are reported in the area 10 miles N.W. and 13 miles S.W. of the town.Long-range Penetration Groups.41. Our columns are engaged in disrupting enemy communications northand west of Indaw. Detached columns are operating against communications between Bhamo and Myitkyina to the east.Pacific.New Guinea.42. Australian forces from the Eamu Valley have made progress down theroad towards the coast, and are now within 6 miles of Bogadjim. They areencountering sporadic opposition.Admiralty Islands.43. Operations now consist of mopping-up. It is estimated that only400 Japanese effectives remain, while the known enemy dead number over 2,900.St. Matthias Group.44. On the 10th an Allied reconnaissance party landed on Massau Island(immediately west of Emirau) and found no signs of Japanese activity.Solomons-Bougainville.45. There has been further fighting round the perimeter at Cape Torokina,where the Japanese are now retreating on all sectors.Nuguria Island.46. On the 8th an Allied patrol landed on Nuguria Island (150 miles north of Bougainville). Friendly natives reported that no Japanese had been there forseveral months.AIR SITUATION.General Review.47. Aircraft factories in Germany and Belgium were attacked by US.heavy bombers by day and, at night, Bomber Command operated againstmarshalling yards in France and the Low Countries, and against Aachen.In Italy, successful attacks were made on railway centres.US. heavy bombers, based on Italy, attacked aircraft factories in the Viennaarea and at Wiener-Neustadt.
In Burma, close support was afforded to the land forces. Transport aircraftprovided reinforcements.United Kingdom.48. Enemy activity was on a small scale. At night a total of 36 enemy aircraft were reported overland, of which, on one night, 12 were engaged inintruder operations over East Anglia. One enemy aircraft was shot down andtwo of our aircraft are missing.Home Waters.49. A convoy, consisting of three ships with seven escort vessels, was attacked by Beautighters off Norway; one 4,500-ton ship was torpedoed and several of the escort vessels were hit by cannon lire and rocket projectiles.In the Bay of Biscay, Mosquitoes and Beaufighters attacked an escortedsurfaced U-boat; the U-boat, an escort vessel and a Sperrbrecher were all hitwith cannon fire and, of the eight Ju. 88 which were encountered, four were destroyed, one was probably destroyed and two were damaged for the loss of threeMosquitoes. Later, four Mosquitoes, engaged on Air Sea Rescue operations inthe same area, destroyed a further three Ju. 88; one of these Mosquitoes was lost.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 224 were despatched, laid 780 sea-mines in enemy waters for the loss of nine aircraft.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.50. A heavy scale of effort and, in the main, directed against factoriesassociated with the German aircraft industry, was maintained by heavy bombers of the U.S. VIHth Air Force, which operated in strength on four days of theweek; the following were the principal targets attacked  Date.

1 In the week&apos;s operations, a total of 3,287 heavy bombers was despatched and,with these, a force of 3,944 fighters co-operated. The losses were 77 Fortresses,56 Liberators and 56 fighters. Enemy casualties by the bombers (provisional)were&apos; 184 destroyed, 77 probably destroyed and 75 damaged and, by the fighters(including casualties on the ground), 354 destroyed, 16 probably destroyed and219&quot; damaged.&apos; Marauders, with fighter escort, dropped about 250 tons on each of the railway centres at Hasselt, Namur and Charleroi/Montignies; photographs of Ffasseltshow considerable damage to engine sheds and repair shops and bombing, at theother two places, was reported as fair to good. Two of the targets, Hasselt andCharleroi, and similar objectives at Haine St. Pierre, Hirson. Monceau-sur-Sambre and Ghislain were also raided by small forces of medium, light and fighter- bombers. Thirteen airfields in France and Belgium were attacked bya total of 314 aircraft, mostly fighter-bombers, which dropped 289 tons of bombs,and a further 269 tons were dropped on Military Objectives in Northern France.Other targets included coastal defences near Le Havre and Dunkirk and tworadar installations. In all these operations, which were escorted by a total ofover 900 fighters, negligible fighter opposition was encountered; four bombers andthree fighters are missing, and 11 enemy aircraft were destroyed, mostly on theground. Similarly^ fighter sweeps, from which six aircraft are missing, were largely uneventful except for. effective attacks on 16 trains and the destructionof three enemy aircraft on the ground. ..- .Night.51. In the week, which covered the full moon period, Bomber Commandoperated on three nights against marshalling yards in France and the low countries on the 9th/10th and lOth/llth, and against Aachen on the 1 lth/12th.The marshalling yards attacked were at Lille, Villeneuve St.. Georges (near Paris),Aulnoye, Laon, Tergnier, Ghent and Tours, and all, except Aulnoye, have since been covered by photographic reconnaissance and are referred to in Appendix VII:A total of 5,721 tons was dropped on these targets and a further 1,877 tons was dropped at Aachen where, except for a tendency to spread to the north-west in&apos;the early stages, bombing is believed to have been well concentrated on the town.Of the 1,581 aircraft despatched on these operations, 1,495 (94 per cent.)&apos;attackedtheir primary target for the loss of 2 per cent. 29 aircraft missing and a further-two which crashed in this country.Mosquitoes, of which 258 were despatched, operated on six nights of theweek, the principal targets being Hamburg, Essen, Mannheim, osnabruck andHanover (twice), each of which was attacked by more than 30 aircraft. Inaddition, Mosquito intruders, with a few Bostons and Mitchells, attacked 23airfields and destroyed four enemy aircraft for the loss of two Mosquitoes.Italy.52. In all operational theatres covered by the M.A .A .F. up to the11th April, Allied aircraft flew a total of 9,916 sorties for the loss of 55 aircraft;248 enemy aircraft were shot down.Successful attacks by heavy bombers were made on the railway centres atTreviso, Mestre, Bologna and Ferrara. A good concentration was obtained at each of these targets in which a total of nearly 900 tons of bombs was released;the damage was confirmed by reconnaissance to be considerable; the passengerstations at Treviso and Mestre were virtually destroyed and at all the centresthe main yards were hit and the tracks blocked by numerous craters, in additionto which industrial plants were seriously damaged. Enemy opposition was encountered by the Liberators attacking Mestre with the result that 29 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of two Liberators and two Lightnings.A series of operations, principally by medium bombers, was carried out against railway bridges and communications. In the Orvieto, Orte, Viterbo areanine bridges and viaducts were bombed, many of which were hit or the approachesrendered impassable; three attacks were made in the Florence area, and a bridgewas almost destroyed at rose to (18 miles N.W. of Pescara). In addition,successful raids were made on airfields at Rieti and Perugia.Fighter-bombers flew a total of 1,584 sorties and carried out widespreadoperations. In the battle area, including that of the&apos; beachhead, attacks were directed against military targets and guri positions on which a number of direct hits were obtained.   In the Rome area frequent attacks were made on railway
tracks, bridges and bridge approaches, dumps, enemy transport vehicles andother military objectives; an attack by war hawks resulted in the tracks betweenRome and Bracciano (21 miles N.W. of Rome) being cut in nine places.A variety of more distant targets also were attacked by fighter-bombers.At Pisa three hits were made on a bridge, an F/boat was hit at Populonia, inthe Florence area roads were cut and M/T vehicles destroyed, at term  37 M/.Tvehicles were destroyed, at Arezzo six Ju. 52 were damaged on the ground, at genoa hits were made on a ship and a floating crane, and at other locations manybridges were hit or damaged.Yugoslavia and Albania.53. Airfields at Zagreb and Banja Luka (92 miles N.N.E. of Split) were attacked by Liberators and Spitfires respectively, resulting in 16 enemy aircraftbeing shot down in combat and 19 aircraft being destroyed on the ground; fourAllied bombers and two fighters are missing. Ninety-eight Liberators were despatched to attack the railway centre at Zagreb, and a number of hits were reported on the target and on the airfield. A factory at Split was bombed by92 Fortresses. At Niksic (40 miles E. of Dubrovnik) Wellingtons dropped 194,000 lb. bombs, the target being well covered. As a result of attacks on coastal shipping, one schooner, five barges and several caiques were destroyed or damaged.Transport vehicles were successfully attacked at Tirana and near Dubrovnik.Fourteen Wellingtons and three Liberators dropped sea-mines in the RiverDanube, down stream from Belgrade.Austria.54. In the Vienna area 172 Fortresses attacked the Fifchamend aircraft factory and 140 Liberators bombed the Bad Voflau assembly plant; results were generally good and the target areas were well covered.Wiener Neustadt was attacked by 134 Liberators, dropping 250 tons of bombs and causing fires and smoke over the whole factory area.

The stores building is completely destroyed, two large workshops 30 per cent, destroyed, and three other largeworkshops very seriously damaged.Berlin. According to a very credible report, it was stated at a highlyconfidential meeting in February of the Ministry of Interior Reconstructionthat an alarming proportion of buildings in Berlin would have to be partially or wholly pulled down after the war. Even buildings that from the outside appeared undamaged could not be left standing, as their foundations hadAPPENDIX YI.Imports under Departmental Programmes.
been weakened by the vibration of high explosive bombs. It was claimed that to restore Berlin to anything approaching its former condition would take from20-30 years.Bernburg. It is revealed, in photographs taken on the 8th April that halfthe roof of the assembly shop in the Junkers works (assembling Ju. 88, Ju. 188and Ju. 52) has been removed by blast, and that the structure has been affected.Another building is two-thirds destroyed and several small buildings whollydemolished.Brunswick.-Photographs taken on the 8th April show that damage toworkshops, storage buildings and to the power-house in the M.I.A.G. works atWilhelmitor (making components for Me. 110) has been severe.

Damage to hangars, personnel quarters and administrativebuildings can be seen at the Broitzen airfield where there are also about 80 cratersin the landing ground. Some damage has also been caused to the M.I.A.G.aircraft component works at Neupetritor.Duisburg (Hamborn). Photographic cover obtained on the 1st April of the august Thyssen Huette A.G. shows that as a result of one of the bomber command Mosquito attacks one-third of the finishing shop has been destroyed.Roof damage is seen over both this shop and the rolling mills and there is alsosevere roof damage to a medium sized building near the finishing shop.Handorf.

To the N.E. of the landing ground furtherconsiderable damage was caused to workshops and stores and at least eight morebuildings have been destroyed or severely damaged. One aircraft on the groundhas been destroyed and four more severely damaged.Regensburg / Obertraubling. Photographs .have now been obtained of damage caused on the airfield and aircraft assembly plant during the U.S.A.A.F.attack on 25th February. This is seen to be very severe, the greatest eoncen-tration having fallen across the central and southern part of-the plant. Amongstbuildings seriously damaged or entirely destroyed are barracks, two assemblyshops, three sub-assembly shops, a boiler house and allied buildings, three large buildings in the M.T. yard, five huts and six probable stores or administrative,[27267] p
buildings. Amongst the ruins of one of the assembly shops several damagedaircraft can be seen. It is noteworthy that, although these photographs were taken nearly six weeks after the attack, no attempt appears to have been made to clear away any debris or damaged aircraft.France.Bourges Airfield. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken afterthe U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 10th April shows that heavy damage has been caused to the S.N.C.A.C. factory buildings at the N.E. end of the airfield, where Seibel 204are manufactured and assembled. Three large workshops have been hit, fourunidentified buildings destroyed or damaged, and a large hangar was still on fire at the time of photography.At the west corner of the airfield nine barracks have been destroyed and an aircraft shelter damaged.There were eight hits on the runway and others on the N.E. side of the landing-ground, and two aircraft were damaged.Laon.
