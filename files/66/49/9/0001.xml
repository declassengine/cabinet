It is issued for the.        personal use of w.P. (44) 209iSth April, 1944WAR CABINETUSE OF TEAR GAS IN PALESTINEJOINT MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR ANDTHE SECRETARY OF STATE  FOR THE  COLONIES1. A request has recently been made by the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East*,that he might be informed of the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the use oftear gas by the Police and/or Military in the event of civil disturbances, with special reference to Palestine.2. This request has been made in view of the possibility of a deterioration of internal security in Palestine. There is unfortunately a probability of trouble in Palestine either at the end of the war with Germany or when an indication is given of the Governmentsfuture policy. As time will be needed for equipping and training the Police and Militaryin the use of tear gas, a decision on whether or not its use should be authorized is now necessary.3. Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, suggests that the use of-force against Jewsor Arabs has good propaganda value to the enemy and that, as a means of avoidingbloodshed, the use of tear gas would have much to recommend it. He proposes thattear gas equipment should first be issued to the Police, but that troops should also beauthorized to use it if necessary.4. The High Commissioner has stated f that he would be prepared to agree to theuse of tear gas, provided that, in view of the obvious implications, the general authorityof His Majesty&apos;s Government had been obtained in advance.Previous History.5. Cabinet authority for the use of tear gas in certain circumstances by ColonialPolice Forces was given in 1933 (Cabinet Conclusion 70 (33), Paragraph 3) and extendedin 1935 (CP (35) 36 dated 8th February, 1935, and Cabinet Conclusion 10 (35) dated20th February, 1935). Authority was also given in 1939 for its use in Palestine, though in this case it was not specifically referred to the Cabinet. It was not, however, used as the General Officer Commanding and the High Commissioner then felt that in wartime possible repercussions made it advisable to prohibit its use. Since the existingCabinet authority is now somewhat stale, it is felt that a fresh ruling should be given.Use of Tear Gas in Other Theatres.6. Tear gas has been used by the Indian Police on a considerable number of occasions during the course of the present war, and also by other Police Forces over-seas. In general the Police authorities have found it an efficient weapon (given the rightcircumstances of weather), provided it is used in sufficient quantities to produce actualphysical effects.  The purely moral effect tends to wear off after its initial use.Training and Equipment.7. The British Army is not, in general, trained in the use of tear gas against civildisturbances. The training, however, would not be very difficult, and this should not prove an insuperable objection.* Telegram O/84314 dated 24 Mar 44 from C-in-C Middle East to War Office,f Telegram 389 dated 28 Mar 44 from Sir H. MacMichael.
The equipment which has been previously used was American Police equipment.It would be difficult to supply suitable equipment from British sources, since there isno Army store specifically designed for the purpose. All that would be available wouldbe a training store.  This aspect of the matter will therefore require further investigation.Military and Political Aspects of use of Tear Gas.8. On military grounds the War Office is in agreement with Commander-in-Chief,Middle East and considers that the advantages of using tear gas in the circumstancesenvisaged by him outweigh the possible disadvantages.Politically, the Colonial Office see no objection in so far as Palestine is concerned.Recommendation.9. We therefore invite the War Cabinet to give approval in principle to the useof tear gas by the Police and Military, under the authority of the Commander-in-Chief,Middle East, in consultation with the High Commissioner for Palestine, in the eventof civil disorders occurring in that country.O.S.P.
