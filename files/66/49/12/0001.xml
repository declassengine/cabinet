THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April U844SECRET. syj Copy No.W.P. (44) 212.19^ April, 1944.WAR CABINET.SERVICE PAY AND ALLOWANCES.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.1. With the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Foreign Secretary, Ihave carefully considered the representations made by Members of parliament at the informal discussions which we undertook in accordance with thte decisionof the War Cabinet following the debate on the 2nd March (W.M. (44)30th Conclusions, Minute 1). After discussion with the Service Ministers,, theChancellor of the Exchequer laid proposals on the major points at issue beforethe Lord Presidents Committee, who considererd them at Meetings on the14th and 17th April (L.P. (44) 18th and 19th Meetings), and decided torecommend to the War Cabinet the proposals set out in the draft White Paperattached to this Memorandum. No attempt has been made to deal with the largenumber of minor points raised by the Members of Parliament, and these will haveto be examined at greater leisure by the Departments.2. The main object of the proposals in the draft White Paper is to improve the lot of officers and men in the lowest ranks who have families, since they aregenerally acknowledged to stand in the greatest need of assistance. In view ofthe need for avoiding a great and unnecessary addition to expenditure, corres-ponding increases in the pay and allowances of officers or men in the migher ranks are not proposed. The result of this is to narrow the gap between thetotal remuneration of the higher and lower ranks and so to diminish the attractions of promotion. It should also be noted that the Lord presidents committee did not feel that any improvement in allowances for childless wiveswas called, for, or indeed in accordance with public policy.3.   The proposals for increases in Service pay and allowances are : (a) Pay for Other Ranks.The pay of non-tradesmen privates in the Army (i.e., generally speaking, thefighting men) should be improved as shown in the following table :  A fter A fter A fter        A fter6 Months. 1 Year. 2 Years. 3 Years.Existing daily rate      ...      3/6rf.         3/9d.         4/- 4/9rf.Proposed daily rate     ...      B/M. 4/- 4/6d. 5/-It will be necessary to make some consequential increases in the pay of lance-corporals and corporals in the Army and some adjustments in the other Services.The total cost is about  12,000,000 a year.(b) Other Ranks&apos; Family Allowances.Where there is a child or children in the family the minimum payment to a wife, inclusive of the husband&apos;s allotment, should be raised from 25/- to 35/- aweek.   The cost of this proposal is  14,000,000 a year.In certain cases increases of pay are wholly absorbed by increases which theman is simultaneously called upon to make in his qualifying allotment. Hithertothere has been no difficulty in this, as the man&apos;s family has benefited. Under thearrangement set out above, however, it would be the State which would benefit.In order to avoid this and at the same time to lessen existing disparities betweenthe Services, it is proposed to make appropriate adjustments in the scales of&quot;allotments.   The cost of this is  6,000,000 a year.[27307]
Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,19th April, 1944.The allowance for children should be at a flat rate of 12/6a. instead of 9/6cra week for the first child, 8/ Qd. for the second, and 7/6*5?. for the third and sub-sequent children.  The cost of this is  18,000,000 a year.(c) Allowances for Married Officers with Families.Where there is a child or children in the family, the daily allowance for the wife of a subaltern should rise from 5/- to 6/6c?., and for the wife of a captainfrom 5/- to 5/6*5?., while the allowance for each child should be at a flat rate of2/- a day instead of 2/- for the first child, l/6c?. for the second and 1/- for thethird and subsequent children. Ante-natal allowances should be extended toofficers.   The cost of this is&quot; 2/3,000,000 a year.(d) War Service Grants.The War Service Grants scheme provides for a minimum standard for the family of 18/- a week per unit (children under 14 counting as half units) afterrent and other reasonable commitments have been met. This minimum unitstandard should be raised to 22/-. The change will operate to reduce the saving on War Service Grants which would otherwise result from the increased allow-ances which we propose above, and the saving will not now exceed  5,000,000 ayear.4. The total cost of these proposals, allowing for the reduced saving on war service Grants, will be about  48,000,000 annually. We propose that the new rates should take effect from the nearest pay day to the 1st May, 1944, but therewill inevitably be considerable delay before actual issues (with arrears) on the new scales can begin.5. In view of the proposed increases in Service pay and allowances it willbe necessary to make some increases in payments under the War Pensions Code.The main proposals are as follows : (a) Widows&apos; Pensions.The minimum pension to a widow with children (or over 40 or incapacitated),should be raised from 26/8*2. a week to 32/6c?. a week. Additions should be madein respect of steps in rank above private, on a gradually decreasing scale up tothe present maximum (for the widow of a Warrant Officer Class I) of 38/-.The immediate cost is  1,700,000.In the case of officers&apos; widows, there is at present no difference in the rateof pension whether the widow has children (or is over 40 or incapacitated) orwhether she is a childless widow under 40. The pensions of the widows ofofficers in the lower ranks, with children (or over 40 or incapacitated), shouldbe increased as shown in the Appendix to the draft White Paper. The immediatecost of about  120,000.(b) Children&apos;s Allowances.The existing &quot;other ranks&apos; &quot; rates of 9/6c?., 8/(id. and 7/6c?. a week forthe first, second and subsequent children, respectively, should be increased to a flat rate of 11/- a week for each child.   The immediate cost of this is  400,000.It is not proposed to increase the existing flat rate of  36 a year (14/- a week)for deceased officers&apos; children.6.   Subject to the approval of the War Cabinet, it is proposed to publish the White Paper on Wednesday, the 26th April, 1944.,     C. R. A.

Increased Financial Provision for Members of HisMajesty&apos;s Forces and their Families with certain changes in War Pensions.1. As explained in Command Papers 6138 of November 1939, 6186 ofMarch 1940, 6260 of April 1941, 6318 of October 1941, and 6336 of February1942, substantial improvements have been made since the outbreak of thewar in the provision made for members of the forces and their families and dependants. With the further improvements introduced in the autumn of 1942, the various measures involved an additional cost during thefinancial year 1943/44 of approximately  160 millions, excluding the ultimateliability arising from the introduction of post-war credits with effect fromthe 1st January, 1942. His Majesty&apos;s Government have now conducteda further review of the provision made in the light of present circum-stances, and have decided to introduce the following further changes:  Pay for eatings and other ranks.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government are satisfied that no general increase in pay is required. They feel justified, however, in approving some acceleration of the steps in pay which may be attained by the non-tradesman privatesoldier, in order to afford greater recognition to the fighting man when fullytrained and proficient.   The present position is as follows:  Non-tradesman private.	On enlist-ment.	After :  6 months&apos; service.	After one year&apos;s service.	After two years&apos; service.	After three years&apos; service.Daily pay...	-3/-   -	3/- plus 6d. proficiency pay = 3/6d.	3/3d. plus 6d. proficiency pay = 3/9d.	3/6d. plus 6d. proficiency pay = 4/-.	4/- plus 6d. pro-efficiency pay, plus 3d. special proficiency  pay - 4/9d.3.   It is proposed that advancement to the higher rates should in future be open after short periods of service, and that the fully proficient man should be able to proceed to 5/- a day after three years.   The result will be as follows :  					Non-tradesman private.	On enlist-ment.	After 6 months&apos; service.	After one year&apos;s service.	After two years&apos; service.	After three years&apos; service.Daily pay...	aZ-	3/- plus   6d. proficiency pay - 3/6d.	3/6d. plus 6d. proficiency pay - 4/-.	4/-  plus 6d. proficiency pay ^ 4/6d.	4/3d. plus 6d. pro-efficiency pay, plus 3d. special proficiency pay = 5/-.4. The pay of the non-tradesman Lance-Corporal will be increased from5/3d. to 5/6d. and the pay of the non-tradesman Corporal from 5/9d.to 6/-d. In view of these adjustments of pay, arrangements will be made tosecure that the&apos;pay of any tradesman&apos; will not fall below the new rates fornon-tradesmen of corresponding rank and service, but no general increase isbeing made in trade rates. The cost of these improvements is estimatedat  8% million for the Army. Some (but not exactly corresponding) adjust-ments will be made in the pay scales of .the other two Services, the detailsof which will be announced in due course.Marriage Allowance for ratings and family allowance for soldiersand airmen.(a) The Wife&apos;s element.5. The State contribution to Marriage or Family Allowance in respectof a wife is at present 2L/6cZ. a week in the case of naval ratings and of menbelow the rank of Staff Sergeant and Flight Sergeant in the Army and royal Air Force. A qualifying allotment is required from the man and is paid to the wife, together with any voluntary allotment which the man maychoose to make in excess of his qualifying allotment. The qualifyingallotment in the case of a man on the lowest rate of pay of 3/- a day is /Gd. a week, so that the wife&apos;s minimum receipt is 25/- a week. the qualifying allotment increases as the man&apos;s rate of pay increases, and anArmy sergeant, for example (minimum pay 49/- a week), is required to
make a qualifying allotment of 17/6tZ. a week, so that the wife receives aminimum allowance of 39/- a week (21/6d. from the State and 17/6fZ. from her husband).6. His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that a substantial improverment should be made in the position of those men with families who are inthe lower ranges of pay, where it is most difficult for the man to supplement the State contribution to the family&apos;s upkeep. It is accordingly proposedto increase the receipts of the wife in a family containing a child or children to a minimum of 35/-; a week. This result will be achieved by means-of. a supplementary State contribution making up the difference, if any, betweenthe existing State contribution of 21/6J., plus the qualifying allotment, andthe minimum figure of 35/- a week. In the case of a man on the lowestrate of pay of 3/- a day, therefore, the additional State contribution will be10/- a week, the amount by which the State contribution, 21/6d., togetherwith the qualifying allotment, 3/6d., falls short of 35/-. The additionalState contribution will decrease as the man&apos;s rate of pay, and consequentlyhis qualifying allotment, increase, until the point is reached where the basicState contribution and the qualifying allotment, together, equal orexceed 35/-.7. Under these arrangements it follows that as a man&apos;s pay increases apart of such increase will go towards reducing the. State contribution towardsthe 35/- minimum. At the same time, however, it is proposed to introduce a revision of the existing scale of qualifying allotments in the three services which will have the general effect of preventing the operation of the 35/-minimum receipt by the wife absorbing the whole of the pay increase. the revised allotment scale will apply within the ranges affected by the scheme on a generally similar basis for all three Services. This will avoid theunequal effect which would otherwise have resulted from the differences between the existing allotment scales. The generally common Scale nowto be introduced will result for the most joart in a reduction of the presentqualifying allotment rates/ where changed, though in some instances, therewill be increases.8. Petty Officers and above in the Eoyal Navy, Sergeants and above inthe Army and airmen in the hgher ranges of pay are already called upon tomake qualifying allotments at a figure which brings the wife&apos;s minimumreceipts above the 35/- level. In order to provide some benefit for theseranks (though, as in the ranks below, on a gradually diminishing scale untilthe highest rank is reached), it is proposed to increase the existing Statecontributions for Sergeants and above in the Army, for the correspondingranks in the Eoyal Air Force and for Petty Officers and above in theEoyal Navy, as follows :  Those at -present receiving a state contribution of 21/6cZ. a week.247-24/6d.28/-    ,,    ,,Future State Contribution to be 24/-    a week. ...25/6d. ,, , ,,25/6d.       ,, :28/-    ,,    ,, (unchanged).9. The scheme, which is designed to assist 1 the family man indischarging his responsibilities, and to give the greatest &apos; measure ofassistance where it is most needed, does not apply to childless wives, whoseminimum weekly receipt by way of State contribution and qualifyingallotment will remain at 25/-. It will continue to be open to a childlesswife, as at present, to apply for a War Service Grant if she has a specialclaim to consideration (see paragraph 4 below).10. The estimated cost of this scheme, including the revision of theallotment scales, is  20 millions for the current financial year.(b) The Children&apos;s element.11. The present additional allowances in respect of children have alreadybeen increased as follows since the outbreak of war:-Pre-war.Nov. 1939.Nov. 1940.Sept. 1942.1st child      ...      ... -    ...2nd child    ....   . ....:3rd:child     ...      ... &quot;    ..4th and subsequent child-ren ... &apos;*  ...  .51- a weeks/- a week2/- a week1/- a week5/- a week4/- a weeks/- a weeks/- a week7/6 a week5/6 a week4/-: a weekil- a week9/6 a week8/6 a week. 7/6 a week7/6 a week[ 27303 J
..... .;;,:;v; 112. It is proposed to increase these rates to a flat rate for each child,irrespective of number, of 12 j&amp;d. a week. The estimated cost of this improvement is  18 millions for the current financial year.Allowances foe Married Officers with Families.13.   The  allowances  payable  in respect  of the families of  officerscommissioned   on   or   after   the   1st   January,,   1942   (and of   officerscommissioned before that date who have elected to receive the new rates),are as follows :   -	Wife only.	Wife and 1 child.	Wife and 2 children.	Wife and 3 children.	Each additional child.Major and above* Captain   ... Subaltern...	, 4/- a dav (28/- a week) 4/- a dav (28/- a week) 4/- a day (28/- a week)	6/- a day (42/- a week) 7/- a day (49/- a week) 7/- a day (49/- a week)	7/6 a day (52/6 a week) 8/0 a day (59/6 a week) 8/6 a day (59/6 a week)	8/8 a day (59/6 a week) 9/6 a day (66/6 a week) 9/6 a day (66/6 a week)	1/- a day (7/- a week) 1/- a day (7/- a week) 1/- a day (7/- a week)* The references to Army ranks apply equally to the corresponding ranks in theother two services.14. Following the principle adopted for men below commissioned rank of providing the greatest assistance towards the discharge of family responsibilities where it is most needed, i.e., in the lower paid ranges, it isproposed to increase the allowances payable to officers of the lowest ranks in respect of a wife with a child or children. Captains and Subalterns inthe Army (and equivalent ranks in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force)already receive a higher rate of allowance in respect of a wife with one childthan officers in the higher ranks, and it is proposed to increase thisadvantage by providing an allowance of 6J&amp;d. a day for the wife with a child or children of an Army Subaltern (and equivalents) and to increase thecorresponding allowance for an Army Captain (and equivalents) to 5/6d.a day. At the same time it is proposed to introduce for children,irrespective of the rank of the officer, a flat rate of 2/- a day for each child,in place of the existing variable rates.15.   The allowances in future will therefore be as follows:  	Childless Wife.	Wife with a child or children.	Wife and .   1 child.	Wife and -2 children.	Wife and 3 children.	Each additional child.Major and above Captain ... Subaltern	4/- a day (28/- a week) 4/- a day (28/- a week) 4/- a day (28/- a week)	4/- a day (28/- a week) 5/6 a day (38/6 a week) 6/6 a day (45/6 a wetk)	6/- a day (42/- a week) 7/6 a dav (52/6 a week) 8/6 a day (59/6 a week)	8/- a day (56/- a week) 9/6 a day (66/6 a week) 10/6 a day (73/6 a week)	10/- a day (70/- a week) 11/6 a day (80/6 a week) 12/6 a day (87/6 a week)	2/- a day (14/- a week) 2/- a day (14/- a week) 2/- a day (14/- a week)16. Officers^ do not at present receive the ante-natal allowance [i.c, theissue of a child&apos;s allowance for three months in advance of the birth of the child) which was introduced for other ranks in 1942. It is now proposedto assimilate the rules for officers to those for other ranks in this respect.17. The cost of these improvements in the allowances for married officers with families is estimated at  2 million.War Service Grants.18. In proposing substantial increases in the regulated rates of family allowances the Government have been influenced by the view repeatedlyexpressed that the needs of the family of the serving man should be met tothe greatest possible extent by way of regulated allowances and that the war service Grants machinery should be more strictly reserved for exceptional cases in which supplementation is still necessary. The new increases mustaccordingly be taken into account in the assessments of War Service grants and it will be necessary for existing grants to be reviewed in the light of theactual amount of the Service allowances received.19. Grants are assessed by reference either to the pre-service income orto a standard of maintenance regarded as suitable for a serving man&apos;s family.The latter arrangement at present provides that after reasonable commit-ments   in   respect   of  rent,   rates,   insurance   premiums,   hire-purchase
instalments, etc., have been met, the serving man&apos;s family should be ensureda minimum sum of 18/- per unit, two children under 14 being counted as one unit. It is now proposed to raise the minimum standard for the familyof the serving man by increasing this net sum of 18/- per unit to22/- per unit. ...20. There may also be cases where the circumstances of the childlesswife are exceptional, either on account of age, or incapacity, or becauseshe has heavy home responsibilities. In such cases the wife will be ableto apply for a War Service Grant, which will be assessed in the light of allher circumstances and of the regulated allowance paid to a wife with children.War Pensions.21. The Government have reviewed the present rates of war pension inthe light of the proposed changes in Service pay and allowances, and thefollowing improvements will be made:  (i) Widows&apos; -pensions. The rate of 2&amp;/8d. a week at present laid down for the widow of a private soldier, who either is in receipt of an allowance in respect of a child of the deceased soldier, or is over 40, or is incapacitated,will be increased to 32/6d. a week. Increases will also be made, on agradually decreasing scale, in the rates applicable to the higher ranks up to warrant Officers Class II. (The new rates are set out in full in theAppendix.) The existing provisions in regard to rent supplementation willcontinue.The present rates for widows of officers in the lower ranks will, wherethe widow is either in receipt of an allowance in respect of a child of adeceased officer, or is over 40, or is incapacitated, be increased as shown inthe Appendix.(ii) bhildren&apos;8 Allowances. The rates payable in respect of the children of deceased &quot;other ranks&quot; will be increased from 9/6d., 8/6d. and 7/6d.a week for the first, second and succeeding children respectively, to 11/- aweek for each child.The rate payable in respect of the total orphan child of a deceased&quot; other rank &quot; will be increased from 12/- to 13/6d. a week.In the case of disabled officers and men to whom allowances in respectof children are paid the rate for the second and succeeding children willbe raised to that applicable to the first child. The existing rates of 24 a year and 6/- a week for the second and succeeding children of officersand &apos;&apos; other ranks &apos;&apos; respectively will thus be increased to  30 a year and7/6d. a week.Date of Application22. The foregoing changes will take effect from the nearest pay day tothe 1st May, 1944, though there will inevitably be considerable delay beforethe revised rates (with arrears) can be brought actually into issue.
