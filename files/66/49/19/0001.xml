(44) 219.22nd April, 1944.WAR CABINET.MEETING OF DOMINION PRIME MINISTERS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. The War Cabinet at their meeting oh the 20th January, 1944 (W.M. (44)9th Conclusions, Minute 4), invited me to preside over a Committee of Ministerscharged with preparing material for the meeting of Dominion Prime ministers and advising the Cabinet thereon.2. A number of separate papers have been circulated to the Cabinet. Itwill, I think, be convenient to my colleagues to have this summary to assist themin their study of these memoranda. Notes are also included on one or two other points which do not call for the submission of separate papers.The summary deals with the items in the order in which they appear on theprogramme of meetings.The Terms of Reference communicated to the Dominion Prime Ministersis attached (Annex I).I.-Immediate War Situation.II. Conduct of the War against Japan.3. It is assumed that the Prime Minister, assisted as necessary by theChiefs of Staff, will make oral statements and no papers have been prepared, bythe Committee.4. As regards the more detailed questions to which discussion of II maylead, the position is as follows : Forces Required from the British Commonwealth for the War against Japan.5. No paper has been prepared. It is assumed that this will be dealt withorally by the Prime Minister, assisted by the Chiefs of Staff.Policing of Europe.6. This is&apos; dealt with in C.O.S. (44) 62, which gives an estimate of ourprobable total commitment in Europe, during the early period of the occupationof Germany.Release of men from the Forces, &amp;c.7. The policy to be followed in re-allocating man-power in this country afterthe end of the German war is dealt with in a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour and National Service [W.P. (44) 162]. The extent to which men could be released from the United Kingdom Forces during the continuation of the japanese war is dealt with in C.O.S. (44) 149 (O) and the Minister of Production^ paper.P. (44) 173. Should Dominion Prime Ministers wish to discuss the question ofDominion units or personnel serving with the R.A.F., it is suggested that such discussions should be conducted with the Secretary of State for Air direct.III. Post-War Settlement.World Organisation Political, A sped.8.   This is dealt with in W.P. (44) 220.   See summary in Annex II.[27324] b
2Future of Germany.9. No paper has been prepared by the Committee, it being assumed that,after consultation with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary will make astatement to the Dominion Prime Ministers.IY. Post-War Shipping Policy.10. It is suggested that the Minister of War Transport should make an oralstatement on the general lines set out in D.P.M. (44) 22 (Revise). This paper willnot, however, be given to the Dominion Prime Ministers unless so decided in thecourse of the meeting.The main points in this paper are as follows : *Transitional Period.11. The Dominion Governments have already had an outline plan for thecontinued control of shipping of all nations so long as may be necessary to securethe essential requirements of the United Nations.Long-Term Post-War Shipping Plans.12. These cannot as yet be formulated in detail. The following points willbe put forward  IS cl basis for discussion : (a) We may have to prescribe or restrict shipbuilding in ex-enemy countries.Otherwise no attempt should be made to limit the shipping enterpriseof any nation.(b) It should be the aim of the Governments of the British Commonwealth toenable British shipping to provide the Commonwealth and otherparts of the world with efficient shipping services at a competitiveprice. But special measures of financial support should not be excluded if British shipping is threatened by foreign shipping.(c) The traditional policy of freedom for all flags should be maintained,i.e., there should be no measure of denial of certain trades, such as the coasting trade, to foreign shipping.(d) The question of machinery for consultation within the British Common-wealth on shipping matters will also be raised.Y.  Civil Aviation.13. No paper has been prepared by the Committee as it is assumed that theLord Privy Seal will make a statement.YI. Regional Bodies in Colonial Areas.14. The line proposed is set out in W.P. (44) 211, which may be summarisedas follows :  15. The Colonial Secretary has already made a public statement in favourof the establishment of international regional bodies in colonial areas. TheseCommissions will be practical working bodies, providing machinery for consulta-tion and collaboration between the States with colonial territories in the region and also other States which have a major economic interest in the region.16. Objection is seen to a general International Colonial Commission withsupervisory powers. But it may be necessary to have some general international body in order to secure certain other advantages, e.g., the abolition of themandatory system in the British Colonial Empire and the Congo Basin Treaties.If there is to be such a general international body, it had better take the formof an International Colonial Bureau attached to the proposed world organisation.YII. Disposal of Former Italian Colonies.17. A detailed memorandum is in course of preparation dealing with the issues involved D.P.M. (44) 23 (Revise) but further study is required.18. The main points are as follows : We have already recognised therestoration of Ethiopia as an independent State and have undertaken that theSenussi in Cyrenaica will not again fall under political domination, and thatAlbanian independence should be restored. There are also strong reasons infavour of transferring the Dodecanese to Greece.
19. Eritrea and Italian Somaliland present a difficult problem. Eritreamight be dealt with by division between the Sudan and Ethiopia. From the pointof view of the inhabitants and of law and order, the best solution for italian somaliland would be its inclusion with neighbouring Somali areas in a &quot; GreaterSomalia.&quot; Since this should logically include what is now British Somaliland,and would affect the safety of Kenya&apos;s northern frontier, we should be reluctant to contemplate a form of administration under other than British control.20. A solution on these lines might, however, be held to conflict with our general undertaking not to seek territorial aggrandisement.&quot; Moreover, adminis-tration of these backward territories would involve substantial expenditure. no definite recommendation is therefore submitted, and it is not proposed to suggestthis particular solution to the Dominion Prime Ministers unless they ask for an expression of our views.YIII. Future of the French Colonial Empire.21. This has been dealt with in D.P.M. (44) 20, in which the general con-clusion is reached that these territories should remain in French possession afterthe war, subject to the acceptance by France of any obligations regarding security which we ourselves are prepared to accept.IX. Co-operation in the British Commonwealth (see W.P. (44) 210).22. This matter was not included in the Agenda for the Conference as com-municated to the Dominion Prime Ministers. It is thought likely, however, thatMr. Curtin will put forward at the meeting the suggestions which he has already made in public, and that Mr. Mackenzie King will see objection to thosesuggestions.23. On pages 3 and 4 of W.P. (44) 210 I suggest certain compromise sugges-tions which, while not wholly unacceptable to Mr. Mackenzie King, might go someway to meet Mr. Curtin.   These are (a) an annual meeting of Empire Foreign Ministers;(&amp;) some kind of formalisation of the present system of meetings between theDominion High Commissioners in London and the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs;(c) a suggestion that the Dominion Governments should attach officials totheir High Commissioners&apos; offices with the function of maintainingclose liaison with the Foreign Office, Cabinet Office and the joint planning Committee of the Chiefs of Staff.X. Military Aspect of Post-War Settlement.24.   This is dealt with in W.P. (44) 220.   See summary in Annex II.XI. Defence Co-operation within the British Commonwealth.25. The Chiefs of Staff have prepared a memorandum (C,0,S..(44)..58) (not for communication to the Dominion Prime Ministers) intended &quot;to serve as a back-ground for general discussions. They have put forward a number of suggestions for improving Imperial consultation in defence matters, e.g., establishment of apermanent secretariat; periodic meetings of Defence Ministers and Chiefs ofStaff; an extended system of the interchange of military staffs; an expandedImperial Defence College; uniformity of organisation, equipment and training of forces; and co-ordination of industrial potential for war.XII. Education.26. The President of the Board of Education hopes to secure from theDominion Prime Ministers a general expression of concurrence on the followingpoints, with a view to further consideration at the official level: (i) The resumption and extension of the pre-war arrangements for the interchange of teachers,(ii) The mutual recognition of teaching qualifications and of - teachingservice for pensions purposes,(iii) The exchange of information and if practicable the exchange of visits by inspectors and/or administrative staff.
27. The President also wishes to raise with Dominion Prime Ministers thequestion of participation of Dominion Governments in the conference of AlliedMinisters of Education.XIII. Economic Policy.28. International Monetary Fund. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will,it is assumed, make an oral statement.29. Commercial Policy. The line to be taken must await consideration bythe War Cabinet of the memoranda circulated by the President of the Board ofTrade.   (W.P. (44) 217.)XIV. Plans for Demobilisation and Post-War Employment in the UnitedKingdom.30. The Minister of Labour and National Service proposes to outline to dominion Prime Ministers the scheme of Demobilisation and certain plans for post-war employment in the United Kingdom. He has particularly in mind thepreparation of a &quot;Human Budget&quot; and hopes to secure the agreement ofDominion Prime Ministers in the adoption of a similar measure in their countries.XV.-Migration (see D.P.M. (44) 19).31. The question of general policy regarding post-war migration was raised,with Dominion Governments in 1943. They were asked whether in principlethey would wish to co-operate with us in a policy of Government;assistedmigration and particularly whether they would wish to encourage migration ofdemobilised Service personnel from this country. No formal expression of viewhas been received from them in reply.32. There is considerable pressure here, both in Parliament and outside, fora declaration of our policy, and it is therefore hoped in discussion with dominion prime Ministers to obtain their acceptance in principle of the idea of co-operation in some form of Government assistance to migration. In that case, they might beasked to agree that possible plans, including the difficult question of transfer-ability of social security benefits, should subsequently be examined between officials.C.Downing Street, S.W. 1,22nd April, 1944.
ANNEX I.Agenda for Conference with Dominion Prime Ministers as Communicatedto them on 5th March, 1944 (Dominions Office Telegram No. 335).1.   The immediate military situation.2. Questions arising from the conduct of the war against Japan, includingthe provision of forces from the British Commonwealth for that purpose and forthe policing of Europe after the defeat of Germany.3.   The post-war settlement, viz. (a) Political aspect, including nature of post-war world organisation, futureof Germany, Italy and the Italian colonies, France and french colonial Empire;(b) Defence aspect, including world security and international use of bases;(c) Regional arrangements, with special reference to policy in the Pacific.4. Questions affecting co-operation within the British Commonwealth afterthe war, such as defence, transport and migration.ANNEX II.Summary of Memoranda on Future World Organisation., Article IV of the Moscow Declaration of November 1943 recognised thenecessity of establishing at the earliest practical date a general international organisation, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-lovingStates and open to membership by all such States, large and small, for themaintenance of international peace and security. Memoranda have been circulated by the Minister of State. (W.P. (44) 220) which embody the outline of a suggested future world organisation, the arrangements to be made for the pacific settlement of disputes, the question of guarantees and the conditions inwhich action should be taken for the maintenance of peace and security. Thosedrafts examine also the military aspect of any post-war security organisation,the question of United Nations bases, arrangements for the co-ordination ofpolitical and economic international machinery and the method and procedure for establishing a world organisation.2. The Minister of State recommends that our first aim should be to bring into existence the world organisation recommended, leaving the details, and a variety of important connected issues of principle, to&quot; be examined later. Theorganisation proposed has much in common with the Covenant of the Leagueof Nations and, in accordance with the expressed intention of the Prime Minister,tries to retain all its best features. It is, on the other hand, designed to be more flexible, less bound by rigid definitions which hamper or prevent necessary action and, above all, endowed with machinery to make possible rapid and effective action against any threat to world peace. It is so designed as to avoid impairingthe harmony of the Commonwealth or the integrity of the British Empire.3. The scheme provides for a World Assembly and a World Council. TheWorld Assembly would consist of representations of all States adhering, andwould serve as a centre of discussion. The World Council would consist of thefour Powers and a number of other States. Great power would rest in the handsof the World Council. It would, for instance, take the initiative in action tomaintain peace, and other members would be bound to follow its decisions.4. Machinery for the pacific settlement of disputes and the maintenance ofpeace and security has been made as flexible as possible.   Its main features are (i) that the members of the organisation shall promise to settle all disputes in such a manner as not to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, without, however, any guarantee being given of theterritorial integrity and political independence of member States;(ii) that the World Council shall be given the initiative to take action for themaintenance of peace and security;(iii) that action by the organisation shall be based on principles rather thanon elaborate definition.
5. The military aspect of permanent post-war security has also beenconsidered, and certain tentative suggestions of a non-committal character putforward as a basis for discussion. They include the suggestion that members should be prepared to place military forces at the disposal of the World Council,by which means it is hoped that the burden on this country and on the Dominionsmight be reduced.6. It is proposed to set up a central economic and social Secretariat as partof the world organisation to co-ordinate the new and untried economic andtechnical organisations.7. Finally, it is proposed that we should, at the earliest possible momentobtain agreement on the essentials of a permanent international organisation.The aim of the preliminary talks at Washington which will follow the meetingof Dominion Prime Ministers should be to reach an agreement which can bereferred to the three Governments in the form of a draft Declaration, similarto that signed at Moscow, but containing a more extended survey of the objectsand principles of the permanent international organisation and an outline of themachinery proposed.8. Discussions on this most important issue will be essentially exploratory.It is anticipated that the Dominion Prime Ministers will wish to consult their governments on the proposals in these memoranda. It will be for the Cabinet todecide what line should ultimately be taken at Washington in the light of theviews of the Dominion Prime Ministers and of the Dominion Governments. Butit is felt that the Memoranda that have been prepared, will serve as a suitablebasis for exploratory and non-committal talks with the Dominion Prime ministers and their acceptance for that purpose is recommended.
