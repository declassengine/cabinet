THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.top SECEET.W.P. &quot;(44) 244.Qth May, 1944.Copy No.WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS TURKEY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.SINCE I circulated my paper No. W.P. (44) 186 of the 4th April on policy towards Turkey, there have been a number of developments in the situation, ofwhich account must be given in order to make certain adjustments to therecommendations regarding this policy in the immediate future.2. These developments may be summarised briefly as a sudden readiness onthe part of the Turkish Government to co-operate with us, even at the expenseof prejudicing Turkish relations with Germany. The outstanding instance is, ofcourse, the complete embargo which the Turkish Government have, as the resultof our representations, placed on all exports of chrome to the Axis. This actionamounts to a repudiation of a treaty obligation on Turkey&apos;s part towards germany. It is not, however, an isolated instance of the help the Turks are now prepared to give us, and the case of the two Roumanian liners, Transylvania andBessarabia, is worth quoting. These two liners have been lying in dock atIstanbul since .1940, and we have at various times been anxious lest the Germansor the Roumanians would use them as troop transports in the Black Sea. Thematter was taken up last summer both by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Angoraand by his Soviet colleague. But the Turkish Government then declared thatthey were helpless in the matter, since the vessels were merchant vessels and theyhad no power under the Montreux Convention or under international law to detain them. When the Russians in their lightning campaign reached the gatesof Sebastopol, the captains of these two liners received orders from their Germanand Roumanian masters to take them immediately to the Black Sea for evacuationpurposes. Before formalities could be completed, the Turkish Governmentintervened removed essential machinery, placed armed guards on board them,and informed the Roumanian and German authorities that, since the liners had arrived in Istanbul in 1940, the situation had radically changed and that thevessels must now be regarded as auxiliary vessels of war and detained.3. I think I should further mention that we have also received a numberof hints that the Turkish Government are ready and anxious to resume military conversations.4. I cannot attempt at this stage to give any balanced explanation of thissudden change of attitude on Turkey&apos;s part, but the following probablyapproximates to what has happened. The leading Turks^have become frightenedat the position of isolation into which Turkey has drifted as the result of herstubborn refusal last winter to give us the military assistance we asked for. Thepolicy of aloofness and indifference which we have pursued during the last twomonths, combined with Germany&apos;s increasingly precarious position in the balkans and the imposition of stricter blockade measures threatening Turkey witheconomic as well as political isolation, have at last made influential Turkish circlesrealise that those who had conducted the military conversations last winter havenot after all been as clever as they thought they were. Whatever the reasons forthe recent change of heart, the new situation makes necessary some modificationof the policy I proposed pursuing in my original paper.5. I proposed in that paper that our policy of aloofness should bemaintained, and that we should institute a rigorous economic warfare campaign,aimed at the disruption of Turco-German trade, abandoning as hopeless, at any[27422]
rate for the present, any attempt to secure military assistance from the Turks.A reversal of this policy is not in my mind justified. The embargo on chromedoes represent a considerable contribution in the economic war against Germany,but there are still other commodities of value to the enemy which Turkey is stillexporting, and we have no firm assurance yet that these will be reduced by morethan about 50 per cent. The medicine which we have been administering has brought about an improvement, but the Turks have still a lot to do before theycan claim to have worked their passage home to their old position of trusted6. It would, in my opinion, be rash at this stage to say that the hintsthrown out by the Turkish Government that they are anxious to resume military conversations really signify that there are reasonable prospects of our obtainingTurkey&apos;s actiye military help in the war against Germany. The possibilitycannot, however, be excluded. Whether or not Turkish help is any longer of use to us is under the consideration of the Combined Chiefs of Staff, and, pendingthe outcome of their deliberations, the position must obviously be kept open.This question has, however, another aspect. It may be considered desirable fordeception reasons connected with operations in the west to give the impression byresuming military talks that we are planning to use Turkey as a base from which to invade Europe.   This is being studied separately.7. Meanwhile, there seems advantage from all points of view in continuinga stern economic policy towards Turkey because (1) Any further reduction in Turco-German trade serves our economic warfare aims.(2) By breaking Turco-German economic ties, we are also loosening thepolitical ties between the two countries, an essential preliminary to- Turkey&apos;s active participation in the war.(3) A policy aimed at disrupting Turco-German trade relations has theadvantage, which I pointed out in paragraph 9 of my previous paper,of deceiving the Germans into thinking that we are now attempting to coerce instead of cajole the Turks into the war. I have notedseveral signs that the enemy has in fact been thinking on these lines.8. In the immediate future, therefore, I consider that our Turkish policy should be as follows : (a) We should begin slightly to modify our attitude of aloofness to take intoaccount the new co-operative spirit of the Turks, but not abandon it.(&amp;) The ban on arms supplies should remain and no definite response shouldbe made to Turkish hints for resumption of military conversationsunless and until the military authorities so desire it, or unless it is decided that deception reasons make it desirable to play up the idea that we propose to use Turkey as a base for the invasion of Europe.(c) We should pursue our economic warfare campaign aimed at the disrup-tion of Turco-German trade, and details of the next stages in thiscampaign are given in a paper (W-P (44) 242) which the Minister ofEconomic Warfare has prepared after consultation with me.9. I should add that from discussions with members of Mr. Stettinius&apos;mission it would appear that the State Department also may be thinking alongthese lines. I shall, of course, formally consult the United States and soviet governments as soon as I have the approval of my colleagues for the policy outlined in this paper and that of the Minister of Economic Warfare.Allies.A. E.Foreign Office, 6th May, 1944.
