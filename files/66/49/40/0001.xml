NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. U.S. naval and air forces have attacked Truk and Ponape in theCarolines and Wake Island in the Central Pacific.There has been activity by coastal forces in the Channel.The mutiny in the Greek Navy has ended.Norwegian Waters.2. It is now known that, in addition to the attack on a convoy off Bodoon the 26th, Barracudas and Corsairs from H.M.S. Victorious (aircraft carrier)hit and set on fire a 6,000-ton ship in Bodo harbour and bombed the beachedGerman m.v. La Plata (8,056 tons). Corsairs also set on fire a 4,000-ton tankerin Vaagsfiord.Home Waters and North Atlantic.3. E-boat activity in the Channel has continued. During the night of the25th/26th&apos;one of a force of ten E-boats operating in the Portsmouth approacheswas sunk by the French destroyer L,a Combattante, and H.M. ships Stevenstone(destroyer) and Seymour (frigate) were in action against E-boats off theCherbourg Peninsula. On the night of the 27th/28th an escorted U.S. convoy was attacked by E-boats off Portland Bill, and two L.S.T.&apos;s were sunk andone damaged. Two nights later M.T.B.S attacked and probably caused damage to a group of E-boats off Le Havre.4. Early on the 29th H.M. Canadian destroyers Athabaskan and Haidaintercepted two Elbing class destroyers off Ushant, one of which was driven ashoreand left on fire. She was subsequently repeatedly attacked by Typhoons with bombs and R.P. Early in the action Athabaskan was torpedoed and sunk.Forty-five survivors were picked up by Haida, and according to a Germancommunique 47 were taken prisoner.The U.S.S. Donnell (destroyer), escorting a homebound convoy in the S.W.Approaches, was torpedoed and seriously damaged on the 3rd and later takenin tow; 27 of the crew are missing.On the 4th H.M.S. Off a (destroyer) was slightly damaged by air attack offthe Isle of Wight; one rating was killed.Mediterranean.5. During the week ending the 2nd, some 20,000 tons of supplies wereunloaded at Anzio. There was intermittent shelling on two nights, but no damage to shipping resulted.HM. S/M Untiring, on patrol off the south coast of France, probably sank an A/S ship on the 27th and a ship of 2,000 tons on the 1st.The U.S.S. Menges (destroyer) was torpedoed by U-boat off Bougie on the2nd and was taken in tow.6. Allied destroyers bombarded Bar harbour during a sweep off the dalmatian coast on the night of the lst/2rid and engaged two enemy E-boats.7. In the ^aegean on the 28th, HM. S/M Sportsman torpedoed and probably sank the heavily escorted German-controlled Greek s.s. Constantinos Louloudis(4,697 tons) on passage from Piraeus to Crete laden with munitions. The GreekS/M Pipinos rammed and sank a caique off Crete on the 13th.The Greek naval C-in-C. reported on the 28th that the mutiny in the GreekNavy had ended with the unconditional surrender of the cruiser Giorgios A veroffat Port Said.East Indies.8. On the 20th H.M. S/M Sea Rover shelled Lho Somawe (N. coast ofSumatra) at close range.  The damage included the destruction of a goods train.HM. S/M Taurus on the 22nd sank a small coaster and a steam launch inthe Malacca Strait by gunfire.Pacific.Carolines.9. Truk was attacked on the 27th and 28th by a strong U.S. naval force which included aircraft carriers.   Ponape was attacked on the 29th and
the 1st, when much damage was caused and many Japanese aircraft were destroyed. On the 30th Satawan (Nomoi Islands) was attacked by oarrier-borne aircraft and shelled by cruisers.Wake island.10. U.S. cruisers and destroyers on the 28th heavily bombarded WakeIsland, causing large fires and explosions.   There was no enemy opposition.New, Guinea.0 11.   Allied M.T.Bs sank some twenty barges laden with troops and suppliesoff the north coast of New Guinea between the 27th and 30th.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. Fifteen attacks have been reported, five by ships, one by carrier-borne aircraft and nine by shore-based aircraft.A U-boat was scuttled on the 3rd off Cape Guardafui after a determinedattack by aircraft from Aden. The U-boat&apos;s crew landed and were roundedup by a party from H.M.S. Falmouth (sloop). On the night of the 25th/26thaircraft from the U.S.S. Croaten (escort carrier). with escorting U.S. destroyersprobably sank a U-boat west of the Cape Verde Islands. A Wellington possiblysank a U-boat on the 28th in the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Intelligence.13. The construction of German L.C.Ts., which ceased almost entirely in1943 after some 300 had been built, has recently been resumed, and 33 are nowunder construction. These, and commercial barges requisitioned in 1940-41, arebeing armed with A.A. guns. Reports indicate that preparations have beenmade to use both landing craft and barges against invading forces, that crewshave been trained in the use of smoke screens, flame throwers and small torpedoes,- and that during April there has been an unusual concentration of barges incertain North German ports.14. It Avas appreciated in March that the enemy had practically ceased to lay down U-boats of normal operational types and had probably decided to concentrate on new types. At certain of the larger yards keels laid down afterJune 1943 had been taken up again. Recent reconnaissance shows that work isnow going forward on U-boats assembled- from pre-fabricated pressure-hullsections : one such hull launched at Danzig in April 1944 was assembled in lessthan six weeks.15. It is reported that work on a base for midget submarines is being actively pushed forward at St. Mandrier, Toulon, where 1,000 men were recentlybeing employed. The submarines will be assembled at Marseilles and Toulonfrom pre-fabricated parts sent from Germany.Japanese.16. The present effective strength of the Japanese fleet is estimated to beas follows, with the figure at the outbreak of war (7.12.41) shown in brackets :9 (11) battleships, 3 (8) aircraft carriers, 18 (11) converted and seaplane carriers,14 (18) heavy and 11 (20) light cruisers, 75 (113) destroyers, 90 (62) submarines,and 4,200,000 tons (7,000,000) of merchant shipping of over 1,000 tons.Losses up to the 1st May include 2 battleships, 5 fleet carriers, 7 othercarriers, 4 heavy and 9 light cruisers, 67 destroyers, 35 submarines and3,540,000 tons of shipping (790 ships including 35 tankers).U-boats.17. The few U-boats in the NW. Approaches remain scattered. The lullcontinues in the Indian Ocean, where a German U-boat which had just reachedthe Socotra area has been sunk.Enemy Attack on Shipping.18.   One attack during the week has been reported; a U.S. ship was sunk by U-boat in a homebound convoy from North Russia.   The escorts for three[27384] &quot;    b 2
MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Kowel-Tarnopol Sector.27. From constant German references to fighting S.W. of Kowel it appearsthat the Russian line in this area runs farther west than was previously known.On the 25th April the Germans claimed to have destroyed the bulk of a Russiancavalry division in this sector and later they announced the destruction of a russian battle group there.   S.W. of Luck the Germans made a slight advance.days successfully warded off further attacks by about 12 U-boats, and probably damaged several of them.19.   Provisional  shipping  losses  by  enemy  action  during  April  are75,000 tons.Protection of Seaborne Trade.20. During the week ending the 30th, 1,104 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 416 were in ocean convoys and 688 in British coastal convoys. One anti-aircraft ship, 56 destroyers (including 24 U.S. destroyers) and97 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes, were employed on escort duties.Pour homebound convoys, consisting of 184 ships, and six outward convoys,consisting of 232 ships, reached their destinations. One ship in a homeboundconvoy was lost.Allied Minelaying.21. Mines have been laid off the north coast of France and the Dutch coastby ships and aircraft, and by aircraft off the Frisian Islands and the Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.22. Aircraft showed increased activity during the week, and laid mines on three nights in several areas off the South Coast.Five mines have been destroyed off the East Coast and one off Portland Bill.The mine totals are 4,770 ground and 4,632 moored.23. In the Mediterranean the recent heavy enemy minelaying operationsoff Anzio, generally combined with bombing, have continued, and a large mine-sweeping force, principally of U.S. ships, is kept employed. Moored mines havebeen laid in the JEge&amp;n.The total number of moored mines destroyed off Malta amounted at the endof March to 504, including 33 during that month.Enemy Merchant Shipping.24. During the week four of the larger and a number of the smaller shipsengaged in the Spanish ore trade have been reported between Bilbao and FrenchBiscay ports. The ore, which is bound for the Ruhr, is taken by rail to northern france and is then transhipped for transit by barge on inland waterways viaGhent. Two German-controlled ships, one of them Spanish and the other French,have been active in the ore trade between Sagunto and Barcelona.25. It is estimated that in the Black Sea, since the end of 1943, the enemyhave employed some 45,000 tons of shipping to supply the Crimea by sea. Some60 per cent, of this tonnage belongs to Roumania.There is evidence of the building of concrete barges at Piraeus and in Crete,and of L.C.Ts. with a capacity of 60-120 tons.In consequence of the cutting of the main lines north of Rome, increasinguse is being made by the enemy of sea transport along the Adriatic coast of italy as far south as Ancona; only small craft are used and these have suffered severecasualties.Russian Intelligence.26. The U.S. cruiser Milwaukee (6&quot;) was transferred to the Russian Navyon the 20th and renamed Murmansk.
T arnopol-Tiraspol Sector.28. East and south of Stanislavov the Germans and Hungarians maintained their pressure and claim to have gained some ground.In the Jassy area the Russians resumed their attacks on the 26th April, butthey did not claim any progress and after a few days the attacks werediscontinued.The Germans have reported Russian attacks along the Lower Dniester,claiming to have frustrated all Russian attempts to extend their bridgeheadsthere. Here, too, conditions have now been quiet for a few days. The Germansstate that on the 2nd the Russians launched the &apos;&apos; expected attack&apos;&apos; on both sides of the Siret but were repulsed.Crimea.29. The Germans are stubbornly defending Sevastopol and are continuing to evacuate non-essential personnel.General.30. It has again been a quiet week. On the whole, the Germans have achieved a defensive success and have even gained a little ground.Italy.31. The lull reported last week has continued but patrols on both sides havebeen more aggressive.   The weather has improved.In the Adriatic sector leaflets were distributed on the 30th April and the1st May in sectors held by Indian formations, those of the second day beingaddressed to U.S. and Canadian troops. There is no doubt that the enemy is mostuncertain of our order of battle as a result of our recent regrouping.On the Eighth Army front small attacks in Cassino on the 29th April and near Terelle on the 2nd May were broken up.A raid against positions held by French troops on the Fifth Army fronton the 29th April was repulsed.Early on the 30th April Minturno bridge was damaged by shell-fire but wasrepaired and in full use by the afternoon of the same day..In the bridgehead U.S. troops made a raid in considerable strength on ahamlet three miles S.W. of Littoria but made&apos;no contact with the enemy on reaching their objective.An attack on the 1st May against British troops in the sector west of theAnzio-Campoleone road caused us some casualties. On the next day an attackfurther west across the Moletta River was repulsed after a small initialpenetration of our forward defences.Yugoslavia.32. German activity against the Partisans has continued to&apos; increase. Theenemy have started a drive in the Truska Gora Mountains (50 miles N.W. ofBelgrade). In Dalmatia German columns thrusting northwards from the area ofSinj have met with stiff Partisan resistance.In Slovenia the Germans have launched several attacks in the area S.E. ofLjubljana with the object of increasing their control over the railway communications.Greece.Resistance.33. The Germans have continued their drive in Northern Morea unopposedby the guerrillas. On the 25th April the Germans attacked Mount Vermion in western Macedonia (50 miles N.W. of Mount Olympus) from nine differentdirections.   E.L.A.S. opposition collapsed after two days&apos; fighting.Civil War.34. Zervas has reported that E.L.A.S. forces have again attacked him onthe 30th April.Meanwhile, an inter-guerrilla conference opened in Greece on the29fch April, but no agreement has been reached for ending the present outbreakof the civil war, or for determining the future inter-faction boundaries.
Burma.A arakan.35. Activity on this front remains small in scale, but there has been heavylocal fighting.Chin Hills and Chindwin.36. In the Palel area, our troops repulsed a heavy attack on the 27th/28thApril, 10 miles S.W. of the village. On the 28th April, our forces raided avillage.19 miles N.E. of Imphal, and inflicted heavy casualties. They subsequentlyoccupied this village on the 30th April.Kohima garrison was attacked and its perimeter penetrated by a party of enemy estimated to be 80 strong, on the 27th/28th April. In the ensuing-counter-attack, our troops restored the situation, killing 70 enemy in the processof doing so. The enemy continues to be ejected from the residential quarter ofthe town.New Guinea.37. In the Hollandia area, U.S. troops which landed at Tanahmerah Bay(25 miles west of Hollandia) advanced eastwards, while the troops who landed at Humboldt Bay (immediately south of Hollandia village) turned westwards,the two forces making contact on the 28th April, having captured the threeairfields on the north shore of Lake Sentani. Opposition has so far been slight.The Humboldt Bay force has also captured an airstrip which was under con-struction 5 miles east of the S.E. coast of Humboldt Bay.The troops who landed at Aitape have taken an airfield some 2,000 yardsinland, which was brought into operation within twenty-four hours. The total enemy casualties in the Hollandia area is now 970, and, in addition, 80 Javanesehave been captured.The Australian forces which entered Madang on the 24th April have advanced northward and captured Alexishafen (8 miles north of Madang) about,the 28th April, and are now patrolling 5 miles northward without opposition.AIR SITUATION.General Review.38. Railway targets in France were heavily attacked both by day and by night.Berlin was attacked by U.S. heavy bombers, and Friedrichshafen by aircraft of Bomber Command.The M.A.A.F. heavily attacked Toulon, and railway centres and bridges in italy.United Kingdom.39. In daylight, two enemy aircraft were reported overland, but a numberof reconnaissances were flown off the South Coast, off the north of Scotland, and inthe Shetlands area.On the first three nights of the week, about 200 enemy aircraft operated offthe South Coast, and a number of these, for brief periods, came overland;Mosquitoes destroyed six enemy aircraft, all of which were long-range bombers.On the remaining nights, only a few enemy reconnaissance aircraft were reported.Home Waters.40. In day attacks on shipping, two minesweepers were set on fire in the bay of Biscay, a ship of 2,500 tons was hit twice in Fecamp Harbour and a ship of 1,500 tons was probably damaged off Ijmuiden. At night, three E-boats were damaged, by Naval Albacores and a Wellington.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 172 were despatched, laid 433sea-mines in enemy waters.Western Front.Germany.41. The two major operations of the week were directed againstFriedrichshafen and Berlin respectively.   The former was attacked on the night
of the 27th/28th by 291 Lancasters of Bomber Command, which dropped 1,037tons. An excellent bombing concentration was achieved, accompanied by severalimpressive explosions. A Mosquito, over the target an hour after the attack,reported three large areas of fire.  Eighteen Lcincasters are missing.The attack on Berlin was made on the 29th by 580 Fortresses and Liberators,and these dropped 1,163 tons with results varying from fair to good. Considerablefighter opposition was encountered and the bombers, of which 64 are missing,jDrovisionally claim 64 enemy aircraft destroyed, 35 probably destroyed and 23damaged; 874 fighters co-operated and these destroyed a further 22 enemy aircraft,either in combat or on the ground., for the loss of 13 aircraft.C; Subsidiary night raids, each by a force of approximately 25 Mosquitoes, weremade on Stuttgart, Hamburg, Saarbrucken, Ludwigshafen (twice) and on achemical works at Leverkiisen.Six Spitfires (two missing) operated by day over German airfields and destroyed an Me. 110.France and the Low Countries.42. A very heavy scale of effort was maintained on railway objectivesagainst which 4,056 aircraft were despatched by day and 1,026 by night. Sixty-six of these objectives were attacked and ovar 8,000 tons of bombs were dropped and 700 rocket projectiles fired. The following is a list of the targets whichreceived 100 tons or over : Date.

In the 23 day raids on airfields, a bomb tonnage of 1,759 tons was dropped;six of these attacks, at Nan.cy/Essey,* Toul/Croix de Metz,* Avord,* Lyon/Bron,* Clermont/Ferrand* and Le Culot, were on a heavy scale, by Fortresses.By night, Bomber Command aircraft operated on four occasions against targetsassociated with the aircraft industry the Clermont/Ferrand works* (217 tons),an assembly plant at Toulouse (260 tons), a repair works at Tours (225 tons) andairfield facilities at Montdidier (378 tons). At Toulouse, Tours, and particularly at Montdidier, good bombing concentrations would appear to have been achieved.Other night operations by Bomber Command included successful attacks, in good visibility, on explosive works at St. Medard-en-Jalles* (268 tons) andToulouse (276 tons), a motor vehicle works at Lyons (351 tons), a G.A.F. ammuni-tion dump at Maintenon* (633 tons) and a military depot at Mailly-le-Camp(1,500 tons).   Night intruder aircraft attacked 24 airfields.In the week&apos;s operations, 5,520 fighters co-operated with the day bombers and a further 813 fighters flew offensive patrols; included in the latter was thefirst operational patrol by Tempest aircraft. Thirty-eight aircraft (13 U.S.heavy bombers, one medium bomber, four fighter-bombers and 20 fighters) were lost by day, and 75 aircraft (72 heavy bombers and three Mosquitoes) of bomber command were lost by night; of the latter losses, 42 occurred in the attack onMailly-le-Camp. Enemy aircraft casualties, on the ground and in combat, were95 destroyed, four probably destroyed and 54 damaged.Norway.43. On the night of the 28th/29th, 54 aircraft of Bomber Command dropped210 tons in a successful attack on an airframe repair factory at Kjeller,*near Oslo.South of France.44. U.S. heavy bombers, based on Italy, made a heavy attack onToulon; 1,171 tons of bombs were dropped. On account of an effective smokescreen, observation of results was difficult, but photographs taken subsequentlyshowed severe fresh damage in the port area. A transport was sunk alongside the quay, and the torpedo shops are partially destroyed; very severe damage was observed in the munition factory, to the main railway sidings, and to a numberof other buildings. Of 60 enemy aircraft encountered, 11 were destroyed, forthe loss of five Liberators and two escorting fighters.Italy.45. In all operational theatres covered by the M.A.A.F. up to the 2nd May,Allied aircraft flew a total of 10,358 sorties for the loss of 58 aircraft; 65 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Heavy attacks were continued on enemy communications, and were mainlydirected on railway centres and bridges. Other heavy attacks were made ondocks and aircraft factories.The industrial area of the port at Piombino was bombed by 186 Fortresses,and the dock and harbour installations at San Stefano by 182 Liberators; medium bombers made small-scale attacks on both these targets. At Orbetello, adjacent to San Stefano, very good results were achieved in an attack by 127 Liberators.Over 200 tons of bombs were dropped on Spezia in day and night attacks by liberators and Wellingtons; similar aircraft, including some Halifaxes, made effective night attacks on Genoa, hits being made on the docks and jetties.Two good attacks were made on aircraft factories,7 at Varese and MilanBresso, by 120 Fortresses; photographs showed severe damage to both factories,and a number of aircraft destroyed or damaged on the ground. The airfield at Reggio Emilia (S.E. of Parma) was effectively bombed by 59 Fortresses.In Northern Italy, a total of over 500 U.S. heavy bombers attacked the railway centres at Milan, Alessandria, Parma, and in this latter area atFidenza and Casalmaggiore. The heaviest attacks were on Milan andAlessandria, where photographs showed very severe damage to buildings, repairshops, carriage and wagon sheds tracks, and to over 500 units of stock. during these operations five enemy aircraft were shot down and four heavy bombers were lost. In Eastern Italy, after an attack on a railway bridge near Fano by 58Fortresses, photographs showed 120 feet of the bridge to be missing.* See Appendix VII.
The activity of the medium bombers was largely concentrated in attacks on railway bridges. At Attigliano (20 miles E. of term ) the bridge was destroyed,and at a point 36 miles N.W. of Aquila a similar result was achieved. At least a further eight bridges were hit, two of these probably being destroyed. the heaviest attacks were carried out in the areas of Orvieto, Arezzo, Perugia, term ,and Florence where the railway centre was also bombed. In a number of instancestracks were cut and the approaches to bridges blocked; several viaducts were also effectively attacked. The total number of sorties flown over Italy by medium bombers was 11,555.Light and fighter-bombers continued, on a heavy scale, the offensive againstbridges; four were destroyed, and at least nine other bridges are known to havebeen hit in these operations. Railway centres, stations, tracks, locomotives, andwagons were also attacked, and severe damage was effected. Other operations were directed against ammunition stores and fuel dumps, roads, warehouses, gun positions, M.T., petrol cisterns and factories. Light and fighter bombers flewa total of 2,041 sorties over Italy.On one night during the week about 40 enemy aircraft attacked the Anziobridgehead; petrol and ammunition dumps were hit but no damage was caused to shipping. One He. 177 was destroyed by a Beaufighter, and eight other enemy aircraft by A.A.Yugoslavia and Albania.46. Liberators dropped 68 tons of bombs on the railway yards at Drnis(28 miles N.W. of Split). Fighter bombers destroyed or damaged about 100 M.T.,attacked small shipping, damaged a number of railway tracks, hit a bridge, and damaged several locomotives and wagons.iEgean.47. Beaufighters probably sank three caiques and damaged a lighter. the landing strip at Paros was effectively attacked. Spitfires destroyed a Ju. 88 offCyprus, and Wellingtons bombed the harbour at Monemvasia (90 miles S.S.W.of Athens).   ..Russia.48. Over Sebastopol Russian air activity was estimated to have been ona. substantial scale. It was directed on the ground defences, the port, the airfields within the defensive zone, and against shipping, both in the port andin transit between the Crimea and the Rumanian coast. One supply ship and six small craft are claimed to have been sunk in the Black Sea. Over theremainder of the front, the Russian Air Force operated on a comparatively small scale.The Russian long-range bombers made two attacks on Lwow, one on Idritsa,and one on Brest-Litovsk; the main targets were railway communications andtransport.The German Air Force in the Crimea is operating under considerable difficulties; not only are the airfields open to air attack, but are probably withinartillery range. The main weight of the enemy operations appears to have beenin the Jassy and Luck-Tarnopol areas.Burma.49. Allied aircraft, for the week ending the 2nd May, flew a total of2,902 sorties; 16 Allied aircraft were lost, and 16 enemy aircraft destroyed in combat and four on the ground.A high proportion of the Allied air effort was directed on targets in the chindwin area, and in particular on enemy positions, stores, villages, and communications in the Imphal and Kohima districts. As a result of attacks a block was caused on the Tiddim road. In the Kalewa district, a number ofrivercraft were either destroyed or damaged, and three intercepting enemy fighters were destroyed. In the Chindwin area, Allied bombers flew a total of226 sorties, and fighter bombers 438.Fighter bombers successfully attacked the railway yards at Myitkyina, anddumps, supplies and troops in the Katha-Kamaing-Mogaung areas.Liberators bombed Maymyo, and the railway yards at Mandalay andMonywa (60 miles W.N.W. of Mandalay). Several enemy airfields were attacked by fighter bombers; at least four enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground[27384] c
and eight shot down. Other effective attacks in the Mandalay area were madeon rolling stock, bridges and loaded bullock carts.Attacks, on a considerable scale, were maintained on enemy positions in theButhidaung area, and rivercraft on the Mayu and Kaladan rivers. Ninety tonsof bombs were dropped on dumps in the Prome area, and oil installations atYenangyaung (153 miles E. of Akyab) were bombed by 20 Liberators.Enemy activity was on a somewhat increased scale. Dullabchara (30 miles.W. of Silchar) was attacked by 20 enemy aircraft, and in the same area fiveDakotas were shot down. Three enemy bombers attacked an airfield nearImphal, while 20 fighters flew a diversionary sweep. Some 15 enemy aircraft attacked our ground positions near Imphal, and a further 30 bombed Kohima.In these operations, three enemy aircraft were destroyed, seven probably destroyed, and 14 damaged.Allied transport aircraft flew 1,355 sorties, carrying 3,138 tons, 1,860men, and 321 M.T.; 457 casualties were evacuated.Pacific.New G wine a.50. In the Hollandia area, Allied aircraft dropped 165 tons of bombs on two nearby airfields, destroying four enemy aircraft on the ground, and also attacked targets near Sentani Lake in support of land forces.In the Wewak area, a total of 260 aircraft raided enemy airfields and stores dumps.Light and fighter bombers on sweeps over Hansa Bay destroyed or damaged a number of barges and about 30 trucks, and in the Alexishafen area destroyeda river bridge and probably destroyed another.In the Manokwari Island area of Dutch New Guinea, Liberators attackedKamiri landing strip and dropped 73 tons of bombs on Mokmer airfield onSchouten Island; in operations in this area, 25 enemy aircraft were destroyedeither on the ground or in the air.

Ground sources report that the American attack on thePomeresche Mo&apos;sorebau on the 11th April so damaged the factory that allproduction has stopped. A large number of German workers were killed and wounded.The accuracy of the attack astounded the Germans, more especially as theworks were so concealed that they believed that the Allies did not know of their existence.Cologne. Photographs obtained after the smoke.had cleared show damage to be heaviest in the Ehrenfeld district, where many factories have suffered severe damage. Further industrial damage has been caused in the east and north-east of the city centre. The city centre itself has been almost entirely devastated. Thecathedral has not been damaged.Essen.-A final interpretation of photographs, covering the attack on26th/27th March and various small attacks since July 1943, show considerablefresh damage in the town, especially in the hitherto almost unaffected southernsuburbs.   Although a proportion of bombs have fallen on previously devastatedCasualties to H.M. and Allied Vessels and to Naval Personnel.28th April.-*J.S. L.S.Ts. 507 and 531 sunk by E-boats off Portland Bill.28th April.-JU.S. L.S.T. 289 damaged by E-boats off Portland Bill.The following casualties to naval personnel have been reported : Officers: 13 killed; 8 missing; 5 wounded.Ratings :  19 killed; 7 missing; 8 wounded.
areas the total damage has now been increased by 145 acres, of which 45 acresare in the fully built up areas. Fifty per cent, of the built up area of Essenhas now been destroyed or damaged. .Serious fresh damage has been caused to the Krupps works, involvingmachine shops, foundries and a generator plant. Damage was also caused toGoldschmitt A.G. (lead and tin smelters) and to the Zeche Christian Lavincolliery at Prosper. The main railway station and the Bergerhausen goods station have been seriously damaged, and many public buildings have been hit.Gaoling en. Photographs taken about four hours after the American attackon the 24th April show that severe damage has been inflicted on both airparkand airfield buildings. In the former case many buildings were entirely gutted(several were still on fire) and buildings containing stores of equipment and M.T.have suffered particularly heavily. On the airfield, three large hangars on thenorth boundary and another on the west boundary were damaged more or less severely, while many barracks, huts and seven workshops as well as other buildings have been destroyed or damaged. There are approximately 120 craters on the landing ground, where three aircraft have been destroyed or damaged.Landau Marshalling Yard. Photographs taken on the 27th April show thatas a result of the American attack on the 25th April damage has been caused inthe southern end of the marshalling yard. The locomotive shed has received adirect hit and the tracks approaching it from the south have been cut. north of the locomotive shed a footbridge has collapsed. In the sidings, 10 hits have cut three tracks and damaged several wagons.Leipheim Airfield. Photographs taken on the 24th April, after theU.S.A.A.F. attack earlier in the day, show that the main weight of the attackhas fallen on the group of buildings on the northern boundary which mainlycomprise the Messerschmitt assembly and repair plant. Almost all the importantinstallations, including all the hangars, store sheds and workshops, as well asbarracks and offices, have received damage, in most cases severe and which in several cases amounts to total destruction. Many of the buildings were still on fire more than four hours after the attack. There are more than 170 craters onthe northern part of the landing ground and on the tarmacs, and 24 on the runway.Two large aircraft (Me. 323) and two small aircraft have been destroyed on theground, while two large and eight medium aircraft have probably been damaged.France.Acheres Marshalling Yard. Photographs show that the attack on the30th April/lst May has caused heavy damage throughout the marshalling yard.The engine shed, the transhipment shed and several smaller buildings have all been seriously damaged, and there is considerable destruction of tracks and rolling-stock, including two engines seen through the wrecked roof of the engineshed.Avord Airfield. Photographs taken on the 29th April, after the attack bythe U.SA.A.F. on the 28th, show that in the eastern range of hangars two are seen to have been buckled and collapsed and another seriously damaged and inthe southern area of four double hangars three have been damaged or destroyed.Bethune Marshalling Yard. Photographs taken on the 1st May after theAmerican attack on the 30th April show that all through tracks are cut by morethan 100 craters in the marshalling yard and sidings, where at least 30 wagonshave been destroyed and 70 damaged. The engine shed has been half-destroyed,and other buildings in the rail centre damaged.ChamMy Permanent Way Depot. Photographs taken after the attack onthe lst/2nd May show damage to this important depot to be very severe. Thepoints and crossings shop, and the sleeper impregnation plant and their alliedbuildings have been almost entirely destroyed, and most of the other mainbuildings have suffered severe damage. The stores yard has been saturated withcraters, and the main Paris-Le Treport line has been severed in five places.Dijon/Longvic Airfield. Photographs of poor quality taken on the27th April show that as a result of the American attack on the 25th April severefresh damage has been caused to hangars round the airfield, and to stationbuildings, workshops, barracks, &amp;c.   Seven of the 14 hangars have been affected,
two of them being destroyed and many of the other buidings have also been destroyed. Many craters have been made on tarmac aprons on the north-westboundary and a few on the north-west/south-east runway. Three aircraft on theground have been damaged.Lyon/Bron Airfield. Photographs taken about one hour after theAmerican attack on the 30th April show that very severe damage has been done toairfield buildings, amongst which many fires are still burning. Six out of theten large multiple hangars have been completely or partially destroyed, and two more have been damaged.Several workshop buildings have been destroyed, barrack buildings havereceived heavy damage and ammunition storage buildings have also suffered.There are more than 100 craters on the west side of the landing ground, whereeight aircraft three medium and five small have been destroyed or severely damaged.Metz/Frescaty Airfield. Photographs which are partly obscured by cloudtaken on the 27th April, after the American attack on the 25th April, show thatsevere damage has been inflicted on buildings on the north and west sides of the airfield. On the north, a large four-bay hangar has been completely destroyed,two more hangars and eight out of ten workshops heavily damaged and two small buildings damaged. On the west side, four out of six hangars have been damaged, two of them very severely. Many craters have been made on hangaraprons and on the landing ground, particularly at the west end. photographs taken two days after the attack show that five aircraft on the ground have been damaged with several others probably damaged. Photographs taken during the attack, however, indicated that 32 aircraft were probably damaged. It seems likely that damaged aircraft have priority in clearance operations and the figureof 32 aircraft may well be correct.Nancy/Essey Airfield. Photographs taken on the 27th April show thatas a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 25th April the main Aveight has fallenon hangars, repair shops, stores, &amp;c, on the north corner of the airfield. two large quadruple hangars have been severely damaged and a single hangardestroyed, while the fuel depot, engine depot, barrack buildings and a number of smaller buildings have suffered heavily. Three aircraft have been damaged onthe ground, and wrecked aircraft can be seen amidst debris in one hangar.Rheims Marshalling Yard. Photographs show that the U.S.A.A.F. attackon the 1st May caused severe damage to the large locomotive shed and to thesouthern engine turntable. Almost all roads in the converging tracks at the westend of the sorting sidings have been broken.Somain Marshalling Yard. Photographs taken after the attack on the30th April/ 1st May show severe damage to buildings and installations in theeastern half of the marshalling yard. The 18-bay locomotive roundhouse hasserious damage and several other buildings have been damaged in varying degrees.The railway passenger station has been one-third demolished. In the centresorting sidings practically all the tracks have, at the western entrance, been cut and there are many more craters in the other sidings. Damage to rolling-stockis considerable.St. Medard-en-Jalles.-Photographs taken on the day after the attack onthe 29th/30th April show that damage and destruction extend from the N.E.part of the explosive works, where it is very severe, to the west border, wheremany stores buildings are seen to be still burning. The main boiler house andits ancillary buildings have been severely damaged and all the main buildings have been damaged in varying degrees. The very large buildings served by light railways have been partially destroyed and a storage tank has collapsed.Troyes Marshalling Yard. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attackon the 1st May show the main weight of the attack to have fallen across theTroyes-Preize sorting siding, where almost all lines are blocked. Both the engineroundhouse and the repair shops have been hit, an adjoining cooling plant hasbeen severely damaged and the flyover at the north end of the siding has been cut.Destruction of rolling-stock is considerable.Villeneuve-St. Georges.-Photographs taken after the attack on the27th/28th April show the main weight of the attack to have fallen upon thesouthern end of the marshalling yard. In each of two sidings, there are manyhits among tracks and rolling-stock, causing severe and extensive damage andderailment.    Two car sheds have been wholly or partly destroyed.    Several
carriage shops and wagon construction shops have been destroyed or severely damaged. The reception sidings have also been severely affected, much damage and destruction having been caused to tracks and wagons.Aulnoye Marshalling Yard. Large areas to the north-east, centre andsouth-west of the marshalling yard are obscured by cloud on photographs taken on the 30th April, but it can be seen that the attack of the 27th/28th April waswell concentrated in the area of the sorting sidings, where very heavy damage has been caused. Each of the 32 tracks in this area has been cut in several places and damage and destruction among the large concentration of rolling stock isvery severe. There are at least 15 direct hits on the through lines on the north-westside of the yard, and to the south-west the branch lines to the locomotive depothave also been cut in many places. In that portion of the locomotive depot whichis visible through cloud severe damage can be seen.Tout ICrow de Metz Airfield. Photographs taken on the 30th April afterthe American attack on the 27th April show that the attack has fallen in thehangar area on the west side of the landing ground and in the barrack area onthe east. Both hangars have been completely destroyed and administrative officesdestroyed and damaged. On the east side two large and two small barrackshave been destroyed while others have been damaged. A large number of cratersextend across the northern half of the landing ground between the two areas.Photographs taken during the attack indicate that one aircraft on the groundwas probably damaged.Clerrmont F errand \ Aulnat Airfield. Photographs taken on the 30th Aprilshow that, as a result of the RAT. attack on the 29th/30th April and theAmerican attack on the 30th April, the sick bay is the only one of the manybuildings and hangars in the S.E. corner of the airfield (including the AtelierIndustriels de l&apos;Air) which has not been damaged. Two very large hangarshave completely collapsed, and nine others of medium size have been partly destroyed or damaged. The main workshop has now been more than half destroyed and the offices have been wrecked. Over 40 other small buildings andbarrack huts have been destroyed or severely damaged. The light railway serving the works has been torn up in several places and the main road past the airfieldhas been obliterated over a distance of some 300 yards.On the northern edge of the airfield five small hangars have been destroyed,a medium-sized one damaged, and about 14 barrack huts severely damaged.Many craters have been made on tarmacs and runways, and about 110 on thenorthern half of the landing ground, where at least seven aircraft have been damaged.Maintenon. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the1st May, shows that the first attack in force on an ammunition dump was very successful. This target, which was attacked on the 30th April/ 1st May, was themain dump of the G.A.F. in France, and about 75 per cent of approximately100 storage units forming the dump have been destroyed or severely damaged. Inthe area east of the railway two very large craters of approximately 30 feet indiameter have extensive blast marks round them. The railway sidings havereceived numerous hits, and the main line between the dump and the south hasbeen cut in nine or ten places.Chdlons-sur-Marne Marshalling Yard. Photographs taken on the 30th Aprilafter the U.S.AA.F. attack on the 27th April show that concentrations of bombs have fallen across the sorting sidings cutting almost every track and destroyingor damaging a large amount of rolling stock, and in the area adjoining thelocomotive sheds and repair shops to the south of the marshalling yard. In this area, many more tracks are cut and rolling stock damaged, and an engine round-house and the repair shops have been affected. South-west of the sorting sidingsthe through lines have been cut in at least three places, and in this area the wragonrepair shops and another small building have been gutted.Norway.Oslo. Photographs, taken after the attack on the 28th/29th, show that damage is considerable in the whole target area and in particular in the BayerischeMotorenwerke plant, which is now almost completely destroyed, and to the officers&apos;quarters to the east.
