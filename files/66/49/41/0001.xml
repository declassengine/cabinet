GANDHIMemorandum by the secretary of State lor India.Since I circulated my memorandum W.p.(44) 236, proposing that Gandhi be moved from his present place of detention toAhmednagar, where the congress Working Committee are detained,Gandhi&apos;s health has taken a turn for the worse,   on 3rd may the medical opinion of General Candy, tit  surgeon-General,Bombay, and Dr. 3.c. Roy, a distinguished physician fromCalcutta5 was that his condition had deteriorated after etemporary improvement and must now be regarded as serious.Both doctors consider that there is progressive deterioration in anaemia, blood pressure, and kidney functions, all ofwhich have a tendency to produce coronary or cerebralthrombosis.The viceroy telegraphed to me yesterday morning sayingthat in view of the serious nature of the medical reportshe recommended that Gandhi should be unconditionallyreleased.   He considered that serious difficulties wouldresult- if Gandhi died in attention and that there waslikelihood of resignations from his Executive council.   he added that the medical reports lead his advisers to thinkthat Gandhi was unlikely to be an active factor in politicsagain.   I was entirely in agreement with the view that inthese circumstances Gandhi should be released, and felt thatthere would be great advantage in releasing him before anoutcry developed to which we should appear to be yielding.By the authority of the War cabinet, who,.with theprime Minister&apos;s approval, were consulted individually, Ihave now authorised the viceroy to release Gandhiunconditionally on medical grounds, on the understanding, ofcourse, that there will be no negotiation with him.   TheViceroy.intends to release him on Saturday at 8 a.m.in these circumstances the proposal in W.P.(44) 236will not require to be further considered. .1 * S. A.185Copy no.
