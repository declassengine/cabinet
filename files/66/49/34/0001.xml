THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.Copy-No.   war CABINET. j-- VYUGOSLAVIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the summary of a report  have received, through His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires to the yugoslav government from Lieutenant-Colonel D. Hudson, who has recently returned fromYugoslavia. He was the first British officer to enter Yugoslavia after itsoccupation by the Germans. He has been there uninterruptedly since September1941, and has had the unique experience of spending a considerable time both inMihailovic and Tito territory.A. E.Foreign Office, 1st May, 1944.SUMMARY OF LIEUTENANT-COLONEL  HUDSON&apos;S  report and RECOMMENDATIONS.I. Conditions of Guerrilla Warfare.1. If any guerrilla movement is to meet with the general approval of thewhole Serb population it must be :  (1) Dissociated from the non-combatant population, i.e., it must be mobile.(2) Completely non-political.(3) Maintained on a sufficiently large scale to inflict appreciable damage onthe enemy for every village destroyed in reprisal.(4) So maintained and organised that the lowland Serbs can, in the caseof reprisals against them, easily join the guerrillas in the mountains.(5) Able to supply arms, ammunition and food to all who join it.2. The Serb revolt of 1941 failed, because it fulfilled none of these conditions and in general because the success of a guerrilla movement depends on theprotection it can give to civilians threatened by the occupational-methods of theGermans.II. History of the Cetnih Movement.3. The Cetnik movement is essentially one of passive resistance to theGermans where active resistance appears unprofitable.4. In the autumn of 1941 the Partisans started a revolt in Serbia andMihabilovic was compelled to join in (a) by popular pressure, (b) by desire to destroy the Communist hold on the country, and (c) by the need to acquire for himself Allied moral and military support.5. The Germans suppressed the revolt. Tito and most of his Partisans fledto Bosnia and. Croatia, thus removing any hope of revenge or of safe harbouragein the Serbian mountains for Serbs threatened by reprisals. Mihailovic remained in Serbia and, convinced of the futility of active resistance, resumed his original12352   [27387]SECRET.W.P. (44) 234.1st May, 1944.
function of &quot; armed protector of non-combatant interests.&quot; Since then there hasbeen practically no armed activity against the Germans in Serbia as the fewPartisans who remained adopted a similar attitude of passive resistance.6. Meanwhile, the Cetnik policy of hostility towards irresponsibleCommunists and passivity towards the occupier, which had been fostered byTito&apos;s failure to maintain guerrilla resistance in Serbia, spread from Serbiainto the Sanjak of Novipazar, Montenegro and Herzegovina. In these areas the .Cetniks, attracted by promises of a greater Serbia to be established after the war at the expense of Croatia, and by the hope of booty when the Italians collapsed,collaborated openly with the Italian occupiers. In return for this collaborationthe latter supplied the Cetniks.7. This situation lasted until May 1943, when the Germans drove the partisans down into Herzegovina and Montenegro in the hope that the Cetnikswould assist in liquidating them. This the Cetniks failed to do and their organisation was either disbanded by the Germans or dissolved of its own accordbecause its rank and file would not fight the Partisans.8. When Italy collapsed Mihailovic ordered his men in the Sanjak to joinforces with the Italians and to move against the few Germans who had remainedthere. In so doing they came into conflict with the Partisans. The latter madeterms with the Italians over the heads of the Cetniks and then proceeded tochase the Cetniks from all the towns in the Sanjak which they had taken fromthe Germans.9.   Embittered by this experience, the Cetniks returned to their old policy -of collaboration with the occupier against the Partisans.   &quot; We are not helping the Germans,&quot; they say.   &quot; The Germans are helping us.&quot;III. The Organisation of the Cetniks.10. The Cetniks are organised on a territorial basis and the units exist onlyin a skeleton form. Except for the bodyguards of the district commanders, total-ling approximately 3,000 throughout Serbia, the Cetnik forces, which theoreticallyembrace the whole man-power of the country, are static, i.e., they remain in or near their homes.IV. Difference between Cetniks and Partisans.11. The Cetniks are a popular Serb organisation of the people. Their main object is not to fight the Germans but to protect the interests of the civilian massesnot only from the greed of the occupier but also from exploitation by irresponsibleleaders whose activity leads to disproportionate reprisals. They are also a staticand not a guerrilla organisation and their forces are mainly restricted to the area in which they are recruited.12. The Partisans on the other hand are primarily a combatant organisation.First the army drives the occupier out of his more weakly held position, and then the Communist party comes in to exploit the military victory.V. General Attitude of Serbian People towards the Partisans.13. Serb hostility towards the Partisans is based on (1) the irresponsibilityof the latter in initiating the 1941 revolt and leaving the peasants to face reprisalsunprotected and (2) dislike of aggressive Communism. The average Serb peasanthas little or no idea of what the Partisans have achieved since 1941 in Croatia andBosnia.14. The peasants general line is that he will not fight the Partisans whilethe Germans are occupying Serbia, but neither will he join them. When theGermans have gone, however, he certainly intends to fight, if necessary, for his political liberty. Among the villagers and townspeople in areas in Montenegro,the Sanjak and the south-western border of Serbia which have been &quot; liberated &quot;by the Partisans, the majority thoroughly dislike the latter. This is greatly dueto their policy of pro-Communist proselytising, and forcibly mobilising man-power.
15. The peasants have, however, a healthy respect for a force which can maintain itself and inflict proportionate damage on the enemy. They are justbeginning to see something of the Partisan ability to do this in the activity of thePartisan 2nd Division in South-West Serbia.VI. Proposals for Utilising Serbian Man-Power.16. Lieutenant-Colonel Hudson maintains that, if we insist on Marshal Titotrying to mobilise the Serbs and if we are in a position to give him arms for them,he might be brought to agree to a relaxation of his political methods in order to^ obtain their support, as he knows perfectly well that they will not join him inpresent circumstances. Lieutenant-Colonel Hudson considers, on the other hand,that it is a mistake to damn the Cetnik movement on account of a handful ofcollaborators who are exploiting it and that if we continue to make this mistakewe will be merely assisting Communist propaganda, estranging the Serbian people and setting the stage for a full-scale civil war.17. Lieutenant-Colonel Hudson estimates the reserve of Serbian fightingman-power at about 200,000 men. Their morale is high, they hate the Germans andthey are only waiting to be shown that they can actively resist them with somehope of success and without prejudicing their political future. He suggeststhat active resistance can best be organised by bringing the Serbs under certain conditions to join Tito&apos;s forces, who are already beginning in south-westernSerbia to show that successful resistance is possible.18.   Lieutenant-Colonel Hudson makes the following proposals : -(1) We should persuade Tito to agree to such a relaxation of his politicalaims as to permit the Serbs to fight in the Partisan ranks without being subjected to political commissars, with the right to wear thecrown instead of the red star and with the right eventually to fightunder their own Cetnik officers, provided these are not compromised.(2) In order to encourage Tito to accept this, and in order to enable him to equip a Serbian army, we should, if he agrees to the above-mentioned &quot;conditions, greatly increase our assistance to his troops now on the borders of Serbia.(3) We should persuade the King to call upon Serbs (i) in the- highland areas to join Tito (under the foregoing conditions), and (ii) in the lowlandareas to continue their Cetnik organisation, which will help lowlandSerbs to join Tito&apos;s army if the Germans attempt reprisals.(4) We should direct our propaganda (i) so as to show that we appreciate the Cetnik movement and recognise its true function, which is to complement and support a guerrilla movement in the mountains, and(ii) so as to support Tito&apos;s appeal and the King&apos;s summons.Foreign Office, 21st April, 1944.
