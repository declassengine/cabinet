THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.Copy No.-      /WAR CABINET.BUILDING LABOUR ALLOCATIONS FOR MAY AND JUNE 1944.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.   -In my paper W.P. (44) 42 proposing the allocations of building labour forthe first six months of 1944, I undertook to take stock of the situation in threemonths&apos; time. I had hoped that building labour employed on the government building Programme would be steadily reduced by the principle of &quot; maximumimpact in 1944,&quot; and that the constant revision of Departments&apos; building programmes, in accordance with their revised production programmes, would secure substantial savings. Since then the difficult transport situation hascompelled me, at the beginning of March, to ask Departments to do their utmost to secure an overall reduction of 10 per cent, in their building programmes,and further to accept a temporary embargo on all new buildijng projects exceptitems of special urgency or operational importance (WM. 45th Conclusions,Minute 2). I wish to acknowledge the co-operation which Departments havegiven.2. I have now discussed the revised allocations for the months of May and.June with the Minister of Works, and propose the allocations that are set outin the accompanying table. It will be seen that the new figures represent ingeneral a reduction of 10 per cent, upon the numbers assigned in Table D of w.P. (44) 42.   There are, however, some points which require special attention.(a) In the earlier paper it had been assumed that the use of building labour for &apos;&apos; Phoenix &apos;&apos; would come to an end in March, but it has been foundnecessary to continue an allocation of 9,000 in May and 6,000 in June.(b) It has been necessary in the interval to revise upwards the allocation of labour to build miners&apos; hostels, the full programme for whichwas not known in detail when W.P. (4.4) 42 was written. I feel,however, that the requirement for miners&apos; hostels as so revised, andfor the preparation of sites for the housing programme in England and scotland should suffer the 10 per cent, cut equally with the other elements of the programme.(c) Supplies of fuel must be kept up or increased, and I have, therefore,thought it right not to reduce the labour previously allocated for thewinning of open-cast coal.3. These allocations do not take account of the effect of the temporaryembargo on building at present in force. It will be necessary to continue the embargo for at least another month, but I will undertake to review the position before the end of May.This paper has been agreed with the Minister of Works.O.
