THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTINTERDEPARTMENTAL STANDING COMMITTEE ON further education AND TRAINING.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Labour, the Secretary of State forScotland and the President of the Board of Education.We circulate for the information of our colleagues the First Report of the interdepartmental Standing Committee on Further Education and Training, ofwhich Lord Hankey is Chairman.2. The Report shows the progress which the Committee have made already,and reaches the important general conclusion that after the war a substantialpermanent increase in the number of persons taking further education andtraining, including University courses, up to 50 per cent, above the pre-warnumber, is both desirable and practicable.3. Subsequent Reports of the Committee will show the results of further enquiries made on behalf of the Committee. The Committee will also suggest the appropriate number of men and women who should from time to time be encouraged to take different forms of higher education and training, and, inparticular, the number of men and women to whom, if qualified, the severalprofessions and callings would offer reasonable prospects of successful careers.Printed for the War Cabinet.

Summary of Evidence so far received.Appendix III. Further Evidence in Preparation.Part I. Introduction.Terms of Reference.1. The Committee were appointed in March 1943 on the recommendationof the Committee on Reconstruction Problems R.P. (43) Third Meeting. their principal duty is to determine the number of persons who should be encouraged to enter upon courses of education and training above the secondary school or equivalent standard after the war. The terms of reference and membership are set out in full in Appendix I. The High Commissioners of the Dominions andof India have appointed Observers to the Committee.Object of this Report.2. During the period ending the 31st March, 1944, the interdepartmental committee have held ten meetings. In addition, a Standing Sub-committee under the presidency of the Chairman, with a composition varying according tothe nature of the subject, have held twenty-one meetings for the purpose of takingevidence. The evidence so far received is summarised in Appendix II, and astatement of evidence which is being prepared is in Appendix III.3. The object of this First Report is to indicate the general lines on whichthe Committee are working, how much has already been accomplished, and how much remains to be done. The Committee are not yet in a position to determinenumbers for particular callings. With the help of evidence already in prepara-tion, and such further evidence as may be required, the Committee hope in their second Report to indicate more precisely the prospects in the various callingsand branches of callings, and to make periodical Reports thereafter to meetchanges in the situation.Further Education and Training Scheme.4. In this war, as in the last, there has been a severe interruption anddistortion of further education and training. After the last war, the Govern-ment assisted some 50,000 ex-Servicemen to take courses of further education anctraining at Universities and elsewhere; in 1941 the Government appointed aiInterdepartmental Committee under Sir Alan Barlow to frame a scheme on similar lines. On the basis of the Barlow Committee findings the further education and Training Scheme was adopted, and particulars of the scheme were published in April 1943 in PL. 120/1943. The scheme is primarily forex-members of the Fighting Services, Merchant Navy, Civil Defence ServicesPolice Auxiliaries, and the Civil Nursing Reserve, and is already in operation for men and women now being discharged from these Services on medical grounds.
2It is intended that a number of places should be available for suitable candidateswhose further education or training has been interrupted or prevented byemployment in work of national importance other than the types of servicementioned above.Advice on Training and Careers.5. At the end of hostilities there will be a great need for authoritativeadvice to individuals as to the type of further education or training which theyshould follow, whether under the Further Education scheme or otherwise. TheCommittee feel that such advice ought to be ready for public use as soon as theend of hostilities with Germany is in sight. Advice is needed by the Service  )Departments already, in planning their education schemes for the period afterthe end of hostilities and for Prisoners of War.6. At the appropriate time, such advice should be issued to members ofthe Fighting Services to assist in the choice of post-war careers and of thefurther study or training which service men and women who are qualified to doso could take in the period between the end of hostilities and their release fromthe Forces. The Committee propose to draw up a statement of advice suitablefor public use on prospects of employment and training in the principal callingswith which they are concerned.Part II. General.Factors determining advice.7. In determining the number of persons for whom particular coursesshould or can be provided, the main factors to be considered are (a) the total number of trained persons needed at home and abroad up to five years at least after the end of hostilities; with such forecast asis possible of the total number needed thereafter;(&amp;) the number of persons already trained who will be available;(c) the number of persons who will be suitable and available for training;(d) the training capacity of the Universities and Technical Colleges andother educational institutions, of the professions, and of industry.Demand.Interruption in Humane Studies.8. In announcing the Further Education and Training Scheme, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have recognised the importance of securing to the countryafter the war the service and influence of persons highly trained in the humanestudies, such as philosophy, the classics, history, law, economics and the finearts, and the Committee recognise that their first duty must be to consider whatis necessary to offset the reduction during the war in the number of persons withsuch training (see paragraphs 17 and 26 below).Evidence on Probable Post-War Demand.9. The Committee have also to take into account not only the pre-warnumber of trained persons, technical as well as non-technical, in the variouscallings, but the number needed in view of future developments both at homeand abroad. Government Departments, professional institutions and representa- 0tive bodies are rendering valuable assistance to the Committee in indicating theprobable developments after the war in various fields of activity and their effecton the demand for persons with higher qualifications. In addition, at the requestof the Committee, the Ministry of Labour and National Service has invited anumber of the larger employers to make a return of the pre-war, present and probable post-war numbers of persons with higher qualifications in their employment.Such forecasts of post-war demand must necessarily be tentative more soin some fields than others but the Committee feel that they may afford a valuableindication of trends.
10.   In dealing with the demand for persons with higher qualifications,special considerations have to be borne in mind :&apos; (a) In the field of higher qualifications, supply may react on demand. Beforethe war the demand for physicists and metallurgists (to give obviousexamples) may not have appeared to be greater than the existingsupply; it would be rash to assume, however, that if more had been produced they would not have been absorbed and employed with advantage.(&amp;) Over a large part of industry, development is nowadays dependent to alarge extent on the number of highly trained technicians and adminis-administrators with whom industry can be provided. The number of persons with higher qualifications may determine, rather than be determinedby, the general level of employment.The post-war demand for persons with higher qualifications will thus depend to a large extent on the policy of industrialists as to the employment of such persons, and not merely on the total employment position or the state of trade.In appropriate cases, the Board of Trade and other Departments concerned areraising this policy question in their discussions on reconstruction with particular industries.Evidence of Substantial Post-War Demand.11. The Committee have found general agreement that there will be asubstantial demand after the war for persons with higher qualifications. In thefirst place, nearly all branches of administration, commerce and industry havebeen deprived of their normal recruitment of persons with higher qualificationsduring the war, and will be ready immediately after the war to absorb largenumbers.12. Secondly, the need for greater efficiency in administration, commerce and industry is widely recognised, and will increase the demand for persons with higher qualifications, both of a general and technical kind.Scientific and Technical Personnel.13. There is a special need for increased scientific research after the war.Moreover, such developments during the war as operational research namely,the scientific study of the use of weapons in operations have widened the conception of the use which should be made of scientific training.Even more important perhaps should be the increased need for persons withscientific and engineering qualifications suitably trained for managerial andadministrative functions. It is significant that representative scientific and engineering opinion stresses the need for scientific and engineering training atthe Universities to be of a liberal and hmnane rather than a narrowly technicalcharacter, and holds that a University scientific or engineering course should notbe regarded as leading exclusively to a technical career.*Overseas Demand.14. The Dominions Observers have raised with their Governments thequestion of employment in the Dominions; information on this point is expectedwhen developments have taken place on the general policy of immigration intothe Dominions. Requirements for India and Burma are also dependent on future policy. The needs of the Colonies, principally to make up wastage and to meetexpansion in the Government services, will be considerable in the immediate post-war period.Number of Trained Persons already Available.15. In certain callings, e.g., medicine and architecture, professionalregistration gives the total number of qualified persons before and during thewar. In the absence of such figures in other cases, estimates of the annual pre-warand war output have been made.* On behalf of the Committee Sir Lawrence Bragg, Cavendish Professor of Physics at.Cambridge, assisted by an officer of the Appointments Department of the Ministry of Labourand National Service, is now approaching, in consultation with D.S.I.E. and the industrial research Associations, selected firms to discuss with them the employment of high-gradephysicists in industry after the war. The Committee record with appreciation Sir LawrenceBragg&apos;s offer of assistance, to which they attach great importance.
Further Education and Training during the War.16.   Courses of further education and training during the war fall into three groups : 1(a) Those in which the training of men has been almost wholly interrupted by the war, e.g., Arts Faculties of Universities generally.(&amp;) Those in which the training of men has been restricted but not whollyinterrupted, e.g., training for teaching and the ministry of religion.(c) Those in which the number trained has been maintained or expanded, e.g.,medicine and most branches of science and engineering.University A rts Faculties.17. The average annual output of graduates from the Arts Faculties of universities (including philosophy, classics, history, law, economics,languages, &amp;c.) before the war was 5,000, of whom some 3,200 were men. Ofthe medically fit men in their second or later year in October 1939 a number didnot complete their full course; of those entering in and after October 1939practically none have completed a normal degree course. As a result, in andafter 1942, the only Arts graduates completing a normal degree course havebeen some 1,800 women and 200 medically unfit men annually. Even if there werethe largest possible entry to the Arts Faculties in 1945 there would be no approach to a normal output until 1947. The minimum deficit due to interruption oftraining during the war will therefore be 15,000; if allowance is made for menin their second or later year in October 1939 who did not complete a normal course, and for casualties among men who had graduated before their war service,the deficit may well be nearer 20,000.Churches and Teaching.18. The training of men teachers has been continued during the war on a greatly reduced basis, but it is estimated that the deficit of teachers for grant-aided schools, due to war wastage and loss of new intake, apart from therequirements for new expansion, will be over 20,000. The deficit in entrants to the ministry of religion is also considerable.Medicine, Science and Engineering.19. The output for all scientific subjects (excluding medicine) of 2,600 for1943 compares with a pre-war output averaging 2,400, and the distributionbetween subjects is different (see Appendix II). In engineering, the output for1943 was 3,000 compared with a pre-war output of 2,300.Number Available for Training.Number likely to be Available from Forces and other War Service.20. With the help of the Services and of the Ministry of Labour and national Service, the Committee hope to be in a position to forecast from timeto time the number of persons suitable for training who are likely to be available from the Forces or other forms of war service. The Committee hope that theService Departments may be able, at the appropriate time, to issue a questionnairefor this purpose to members of the Forces.21. In the Arts Faculties a considerable number of men students have beguntheir University courses,&quot; or taken special short courses, before entering theServices. Many will be looking forward to resuming their studies on release from the Forces; on the other hand, some will prefer to take immediate jobs.The incidence of casualties has also been heavy among potential arts graduates.It will probably be necessary to make awards in arts subjects to a substantial number who had not entered a course of further education before their war service,and it is hoped that there will be opportunities for men and women in theServices, between the end of hostilities and their release, to study for and takeexaminations exempting from University entrance examinations.22. The majority of those trained in medicine, science and engineeringduring the war have taken shortened courses. Many will require to take the finalyear of a graduate course, and a limited number will need post-graduate training.23. It seems probable that for a large number of men and women demobilisedfrom war service, including many of the scientists and engineers who have taken
shortened courses during the war, refresher courses and practical training inthe professions, commerce and industry rather than normal academic training willbe required.24. After the war many men and women who have proved themselves in practical tasks during the war will thus, if they are given the opportunity, obtainhigher qualifications. They should then possess unusual qualities, of which thefullest use should be made in all branches of the national life.Method of Selection for Further Education and Training Awards.25. The selection of persons possessing suitable qualities of mind and character for Further Education and Training awards will be a matter of thefirst importance. The Committee attach particular importance to the recommen-dation of the Barlow Committee that selection should be based on the personalinterviewing of candidates, and take the view that, to ensure common standards, -a special interviewing Board or number of Boards will be required.Entry from Schools.26. The entry to courses of further education and training from the schoolsafter the end of hostilities will be affected by the policy which may be adopted as to the continuance of conscription, and by the proposed reorganisation of thenational system of education.If the present rules for war time conscription at 18 are considerablyprolonged the interruption in the education of graduates in University ArtsFaculties will have serious long-term effects. The Committee consider that theconditions of deferment from military service of students taking such coursesshould be reviewed with a view to their relaxation at the earliest possible momentafter the end of hostilities with Germany.Training Capacity.Further Education and Training in the Services.27. Facilities for further education and training of men and women betweenthe end of hostilities and their release from the Armed Forces will be provided as far as possible by the Services&apos; educational organisations, supplemented bycorrespondence courses, and by any facilities that the Universities and othereducational institutions may be able to supply directly.Technical Colleges.28. The Education Departments estimate that Technical, Commercial andArt Colleges and Schools will be able to provide accommodation to meet anydemands for further education and training likely to be made.U niversities.29. At Universities the average number of students before the war was50,000, with an annual entry of 15,000. During the Avar the number of Universitystudents has been reduced to about 35,000.University staffs have been greatly depleted during the war, and some30 per cent, of their members are engaged in war service, in the Forces and government Departments. There has been practically no recruitment during thewar to make up wastage, and there will be numerous retirements at the end ofhostilities.   There has also been damage to, and requisitioning of, buildings.30. It is already clear that steps will have to be taken in advance for therestoration of staff and buildings, to enable Universities to deal with the numbers to be trained under the Further Education and Training Scheme and otherwise.The Universities have provided the Ministry of Labour and National service with a list of their staff now on war service and have been asked to make anestimate of the maximum accommodation that may be available in the variousFaculties in the period, of abnormal pressure after the war.31. At the end of hostilities the Universities will receive application for admission for : (a) The annual entry from the Schools. If conscription is continued at or about the age of 18, this will not return to the normal for the periodof conscribed service;
(&amp;) men and women who have finished their war service, including thoseassisted under the Further Education and Training Scheme;(c) students from overseas, including Dominion and Allied ex-Servicemen.Students from Overseas.32. The Committee have discussed with the Government Departmentsconcerned, and with the British Council and the Universities, the question ofthe extent to which students from overseas can be accommodated after the warin Universities in this country. It appears that the number of overseas students who will wish to take University courses in this country, sponsored by their governments or by the British Council or otherwise, will be much larger than before the war.33. There are indications that a number of Dominions ex-Service personnelmay wish to take courses at Universities in this country after the end of hostilities,and correspondingly a number of United Kingdom ex-Service personnel may wish to take courses at Dominions Universities. The Committee hope that aninterchange of University facilities for ex-Service men and women between theDominions and United Kingdom can be arranged, and the Dominions Office andthe Dominions Observers are exploring these possibilities.34. The Committee also have in mind the possibility of a similar inter-change of facilities with the United States and with other Allied countries. Suchinterchange would not only make it easier to accommodate students from overseasin Universities in this country, but would widen the opportunities for mutual understanding between nations.35. It is desirable that accommodation for overseas students at Universitiesin this country should be residential, and such accommodation will be limited.Regulation of numbers entering Universities in early post-war years.36. Pressure on accommodation in the Universities may raise a problemof preserving a balance (a) between the numbers to be trained under the Further Education Schemeand those entering directly from schools or other sources, includingoverseas students;(b) between the numbers of students preparing for different callings.The Committee &apos;s advice on numbers will be available to the Universitiesin regulating admission, and to the Government in making awards under theFurther Education and Training Scheme.The Committee consider that the number of places to be made available forex-Service men and women should be arranged with the educational and trainingauthorities, probably on an annual basis, according to the progress of demobilisa-tion and the availability of accommodation.Professional and Practical Training.37. The Minister of Labour and National Service is approaching industrial and professional firms concerning the arrangements to be made under theFurther Education Scheme for practical training in industrial and professionalestablishments.Part III. Future Scope of further Education and Training.Importance of Further Education and Training.38. Trained intelligence and ability are among the nation&apos;s greatestassets as has been strikingly demonstrated in this war and are destined to beof increasing importance. We are entering an age in which organising and scientific capacity may well make the difference between victory or defeat inwar, between prosperity or decline in peace.Comparative numbers in different countries.39. In the past we have been apt, as a nation, to take for granted the adequacy of provision for further education in this country, compared with others. There have been many naval scares in our history, but few scares aboutfurther education. At the present time, there is a not unhealthy reactionagainst any complacency in this respect.   It is true that University education
in this country has remained on a comparatively modest scale, especially when our overseas obligations are taken into account (see paragraph 14). The numberof inhabitants per University student in 1934 was :  Japan......       ...      991 Germany.......      604*Great Britain ...      885 Trance ......      480Italy   ...      ...      ...      808 tU.S.A. ......      275No precise figures are obtainable for the U.S.S.R. but it is known that provision for education at all stages, on a mammoth scale, has been made duringthe last fifteen years.40. Numbers by themselves mean little if quality is not also taken intoaccount. A genuine University education aims at the fullest development of intelligence rather than training in a particular technique, at implanting a desire for knowledge rather than a fund of knowledge (which can only be gained by subsequent study and experience), and at the all-round development ofpersonality rather than of intellect only. It is largely because our Universitieshave maintained the conception of such an education, that their size hasincreased comparatively slowly. There has never been in this country thedilution and debasement of University education sometimes manifested else-where, nor has there been any serious danger of the uncontrolled expansion of student population, such as occurred in Germany and some other european states between the two wars, with consequent unemployment and frustration.Apart from some over-production of teachers in the 1930&apos;s there has been littleunemployment of graduates as a class in this country. Even so, the Universitystudent population in the United Kingdom grew from 20,250 in 1900 to 50,600in 1934.The Committee are, however, of the opinion that even when quality istaken into account, and like is compared with like, the number of personsreceiving further education in this country before the war was smaller in proportion to population than those in some other countries of the first rank,and will not be adequate to our future needs.Need for substantial increase of numbers in this country.41. It is clear that the post-war developments contemplated in public services, in commerce and in industry, cannot be realised without an increasein the number of persons with higher qualifications. The extent of the increaserequired will depend on the progress of these developments and on the recognition by employers of the need for persons with higher qualifications asa means of promoting efficiency.Extent to which increase is practicable.42.. What are the possibilities of permanent expansion in the ouput ofpersons with higher qualifications after the war ?If a standard of genuine University education is to be maintained,expansion of the Universities will be limited, apart from other considerations,by the number of potential University teachers and students of the right quality.Students capable of taking a first or high second-class honours degree who set the intellectual standard for the student population, and from whom unversity teachers are recruited, will always be comparatively rare.Universities.The opportunities of obtaining a University education open to theacademically brilliant student are already extensive. Before the war, about50 per cent, of University students were financially assisted in one way or another. There is undoubtedly a reserve of talent which has not yet been tappedand, with the reorganisation of the national system of education, it is hopedthat increasing use will be made of this reserve. As Marshall, the economist,wrote some years ago : &quot; there is no extravagance more prejudicial to the growth of national wealth than that wasteful negligence which allows genius whichhappens to be born of lowly parentage to expend itself in lowly work.&quot;43. It is, however, not only the academically brilliant students who canbenefit by University education.  In. the evidence which is before the Committee* England 1,013; Wales 741; Scotland 473.   .t If courses not of a genuine post-secondary character are included, the figure for united States was 125.
it is apparent that, both on the technical and the non-technical side, there is alsoa need for men and women of sound, but not brilliant, intelligence, but withqualities of character and capacity for leadership above the average, to receiveUniversity education.During the war the Universities have had experience of a large number ofState bursars and service probationers entering from secondary schools or from employment, some of whom would not in pre-war circumstances have reached the universities, but have shown themselves well able to benefit from a university education. This suggests that there is scope for a considerable increase in thenumber of University students without sacrifice of quality, provided thatstudents of this type are selected on the basis of personality as well as of gintellectual achievement, and that they are not expected to reach the standard of specialised attainment in their degree course appropriate to the academicallybrilliant students.44. It follows that increase in the number of University students need notbe effected by lowering the standard of scholarship, and merely multiplyingthird-rate scholars. There might be two principles, of selection corresponding to the two distinct types of potential University student mentioned above.Technical Colleges.45. One effect of the requirements of the new Education Bill will be toincrease considerably the numbers of students taking vocational courses, and this increase will be particularly marked during the period of compulsory daytimerelease, i.e., up to the age of 18. Beyond that age attendance will be voluntary,but it can be confidently expected that industry will increasingly encourage thecontinued attendance of their young employees at Technical Colleges. The resultwill be an increase in the numbers of National Certificate candidates at both theOrdinary and the Higher stages. From those succeeding in qualifying, somemight with advantage, if the University authorities agree, proceed to the universities at one of three levels. Some of the candidates qualifying at theOrdinary stage would be fitted to begin degree courses; of the candidatesqualifying at the Higher stage, some would be suitable to enter degree courses atan appropriate intermediate point; and a few of the best would be equipped totake post-graduate courses in special subjects. All of these candidates wouldhave the great advantage of possessing considerable works experience.Practical Training in Professions, Commerce and Industry.46. Expansion of the number of persons with higher qualifications will depend also on the capacity of the professions, commerce and industry todevelop facilities for professional and practical training. At present, only acomparatively few large and progressive firms have regular schemes for suchtraining at the higher level.47. In this connection the Committee note the plans now being made for a school of Aeronautical Science to give special training of a post-graduatecharacter for the aircraft industry. They consider that the need for similar facilities in other key industries should be examined.48. If quality of output is maintained and there is adequate machineryfor linking training with employment, there is little risk of an increased supplyof persons with higher qualifications exceeding the demand^Recommendation on Increase in Numbers.49. The Committee are satisfied that a substantial permanent increase afterthe war in the total number of students taking courses of further education, 9including University courses, up to 50 per cent, above the pre-war number, is both a desirable and practicable aim. The greater part of this increase shouldbe in scientific and technical subjects. In order to achieve this increase, an expansion of University facilities may be necessary.In bringing this conclusion to the attention of the Ministers concerned withthe organisation of facilities for further education and training, the committee recommend that plans should be worked out by the appropriate authorities,* The nature of the machinery required to enable such persons to find appropriateemployment when trained will be dealt with in the Report of the Higher j AppointmentsCommittee. 1
Importance of Principle of Pure Learning.50. In relating the number of students to the needs of the professions, theCommittee do not overlook the principle which is vital to the well-being of the universities and the nation, that the Universities, both teachers and students,pursue knowledge for its own sake and not only as a means of preparation forcareers. If this aim were to be obscured by an excessive preoccupation withvocational training the objects of the Committee would be largely defeated. Forexample, applied science and industry cannot flourish without the stimulus of pureresearch. Moreover, the inspiration and example given by teachers who pursueknowledge for its own sake are among the most valuable elements in the further education of potential leaders, not only for research but for practical affairs.Part IY.-Summary, with Conclusions and Recommendations.I. Introduction.(i) Authoritative advice, as to the type of further education or trainingwhich individuals should be encouraged to follow, whether under the Govern-menfs Further Education and Training Scheme, or otherwise, ought to be ready for public use as soon as the end of hostilities with Germany is in sight, and is needed by the Service Departments already in planning education schemes for prisoners of war, and for post-war. The Committee hope to report in the nearfuture on the prospects of employment and training in particular callings, andto make periodical Reports thereafter.The Committee have kept steadily in mind that the scheme of further education and Training is primarily for ex-members of the Fighting Services,Merchant Navy, Civil Defence Services, Police Auxiliaries, and the CivilNursing Reserve; but that it is intended that a number of places at universities and elsewhere should be available for candidates whose further education or training has been interrupted or prevented by employment in work of national importance other than the types of service mentioned above.   (Paras. 3-5.)(ii) The A dmdralty, War Office and A ir Ministry should issue advice basedon the Committee&apos;s Reports to members of the Fighting Services for theirguidance at the appropriate time. (Para. 6.)II.- General.(iii) The Committee have taken and are still taking evidence from Govern-ment Departments, professional institutions, and representative bodies bearing on the probable post-war demand for persons with further education and training,and, at the request of the Committee, the Ministry of Labour and National service has invited a number of larger employers to make a return containing information on the subject. Such forecasts, however, can only be tentative and give an indica-tion of trends. Points that stand out, however, are a probable substantial demandfor persons with higher qualifications; the recognised need for greater efficiency in public administration, commerce and industry, and for increased industrial research and development; the increased need for persons with scientific and engineering qualifications suitably trained for managerial and administrativefunctions; and the need for scientific and engineering training at Universitiesto be of a liberal and humane rather than of a narrowly technical character.(Paras. 7-14.)(iv) During the war, certain types of training have been almost whollyinterrupted, except for medically unfit men and women. In the Arts Facultiesof Universities, the deficit of graduates due to such interruption and to casualtieswill be at least 15,000. For a few callings, such as teaching, training of fit men has continued on a restricted basis. In medicine, science and engineering the peace-time output has been maintained and in some branchessubstantially increased.   (Paras. 15-19.)(v) The Committee, with the help of the Services and of the Ministry ofLabour, hope to be able to forecast, from time to time, the number of personssuitable for further education and training who are likely to be released from war service. The number of men and women for whom such education andtraining is required in varying degree is likely to be large.   (Paras. 20-24.)(vi) The Committee attach particular importance to the recommendation ofthe Barlow Committee that the selection of persons possessing suitable qualitiesfor Further Education and Training awards should be based on personal inter-view. The Departments administering the Scheme should set up a number ofinterviewing Boards. (Para. 25.)
(vii) The Committee recommend that the Ministry of Labour and NationalService should review the conditions of deferment from military service of students taking University Arts courses, with a view to their relaxation at theearliest possible moment after the end of hostilities with Germany. (Para. 26.)(viii) Facilities for further education and training of men and womenbetween the end of hostilities and their release from the Armed Forces will beprovided, as far as possible, by the Services&apos; educational organisations. (Para. 27.)(ix) The Technical, Commercial and Art Colleges and Schools are estimated by the Education Departments to be able to provide the necessary accommodation.(Para. 28.)(x) The demand on the Universities is likely to be heavy. It will come fromthe annual entry from the Schools; men and women who have finished their war service, including those assisted by the Further Education and Training Schemes;students from overseas, &amp;c, including Dominion and allied ex-Servicemen. Atthe request of the Committee, the Universities are making an estimate of themaximum accommodation likely to be available in the period of abnormal pressureafter the end of hostilities.The Government Departments concerned should make preparation in andvance for the restoration of teaching staff and buildings to enable Universities to dealwith the numbers requiring training under the Further Education Scheme and otherwise. (Para. 30.)(xi) An interchange of University facilities for ex-service men and womenbetween the United Kingdom and the Dominions should be arranged. TheCommittee are in touch with the Dominions Observers and the Dominions office on this question. The Committee also have in mind the question of a similarinterchange between the United Kingdom and the United States and possiblyother Allied countries. (Paras. 33-35.)(xii) Pressure on accommodation in the Universities may raise a problemof ensuring equitable treatment for those who wish to enter after their war service, as compared with students applying direct from Schools, or from overseas.The Committee propose to keep in touch with Universities on this point, witha view to arranging the number of places to be made available for ex-Servicemen and women, according to the progress of demobilisation and the availability of accommodation. (Para. 36.)(xiii) The Ministry of Labour and National Service is approachingindustrial and professional firms concerning the arrangements to be made underthe scheme for practical training in industrial and professional establishments.(Para. 37.)III. Future Scope of Further Education and Training.(xiv) The quality and number of persons with higher qualifications is a factor of increasing national importance, both in war and peace. Comparisonwith other countries indicates that Great Britain is being outstripped in thisrespect by other major Powers. (Paras. 38-40.)(xv) The developments now being planned in the public services, commerce and industry as part of the reconstruction programme will require for theirrealisation a substantial permanent increase in the supply of persons with higherqualifications, in addition to the supply forthcoming through the Further Educa-tion and Training Scheme. After taking into account the possible trainingcapacity of Universities and Technical Colleges, of the professions, commerce and industry, and the potential supply of persons suitable for training, theCommittee are satisfied that a substantial permanent increase in the number ofpersons taking further education and training, including University courses, upto 50 per cent, above the pre-war number, is both desirable and practicable. Thegreater part of the increase should be in scientific and technical subjects. Inorder to achieve this increase an expansion of University facilities may benecessary. In bringing this conclusion to the attention of the Ministers concernedwith the organisation of facilities for further education and training, the Com-mittee recommend that plans should be worked out by the appropriate authorities.(Paras. 41-50.)Signed on behalf of the Committee : .ELANKEY, Chairman.12th April, 1944.

Summary of evidence so far received on particular callings.Group I.Callings in which the training of men has been almost completely interruptedduring the war.The main callings under this heading are Accountancy. Insurance.Advertising. Journalism.Architecture. Law.Banking. Management (Commercial and Industrial).Commerce. Music and the Fine Arts.- 1 Commercial Art and Design. Social work.Economics and Statistics. Surveying and Valuing.Estate Management. Town Planning.In these callings persons with higher qualifications are, to a large extent,graduates in the Arts Faculties of Universities, such as Philosophy, Classics,History, Law, Economics, Languages, &amp;c.The Committee have so far taken evidence on Banking from the Bank of England, and other Banking representatives.Commerce and Industry generally, including the Export Trade,from the Department of Overseas Trade, the Business Members of theIndustrial and Export Council of the Board of Trade, the Business adviser to the Colonial Office, and the Association of Overseas Chambers ofCommerce.Land Agents from the Agriculture Departments and the professionalInstitution.(a) Banking.The Banks estimate that, after absorbing staff now in the Forces, their requirements will be limited to the normal pre-war intake from Universities and schools.(b) Commerce and Industry, including Export Trade.There is likely to be a substantial demand for persons with higherqualifications immediately after the end of hostilities to make up wastage, aswell as an increased, demand to raise efficiency.(c) Land A gents.There is likely to be a decrease in resident Land Agents, but a considerable increase in Agents for general practice and consultation. Apart from those whosetraining has been interrupted, there will be a limited number of openings forex-Service men who wish to train for this profession.Group II.Callings in which the training of men has been partly interrupted during the war.(a) Churches.Preparatory evidence has been received from the Bishop of Maidstone,representing the Church of England, and acting also on behalf of the repre-sentatives of the Free Churches. The Committee assume that encouragementshould be given to persons who desire and, are accepted for training by anyrecognised religious denomination after the end of hostilities.(b) Personnel Management.The Committee have taken evidence from the Factory and WelfareDepartment of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, &quot;the Institute ofLabour Management, and, the Industrial Welfare Society.During the war there has been a marked increase in demand which has been partly met by the Ministry of Labour three months&apos; Emergency Training Scheme
for men and women over the age of 25. It is estimated that an annual outputafter the war of 100 men and 75 women from recognised training courses wouldbe sufficient to meet demand.(c) Teaching.The Education Departments estimate that the demand for grant-aidedschools will be Teachers.By 1945, to make up loss of new intake and war wastage...     22,500Within a period of 5 to 10 years of the end of hostilities -under   the   education   proposals   before   Parliament,   an addition of for England and Wales............... 79,000for Scotland      .................. 9,000A number will also be required for non-grant-aided schools.A material proportion should have a University degree.   The problem ofsupply will be formidable in respect of both numbers and quality.Group III.Callings in which the training of men has continued during the war.(a) Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Service.The Committee have taken evidence from The Ministry of Agriculture.The Department of Agriculture for Scotland...The Agricultural Research Council.The Colonial Office, andThe Forestry Commission.Agricultural Research and Specialised Advisory Services.The Departments concerned estimate that in the first three years after thewar facilities will be available for the training of some 50 ex-Service men perannum and that such a number can readily be absorbed. A considerable numberof young biologists who have gone into the Forces or other forms of war service would be suitable if carefully selected and given further post-graduate training.General Agricultural Advisory Service.About 60 men per annum who have been engaged in war service can be trained and absorbed, in the first three years after the war.Forestry.The estimated demand is Home Forest Service (if the White Paper on Post-war Forest Policyis implemented).For the first five years after the war, 30-40 annually; thereafter 15-20.Colonial Service.In the first post-war year, 20; thereafter 6-10 annually.For the first few years after the war, demands can be met by two-year courses for men selected from the Forces, on the basis of previous training, supplemented by the annual output from Universities.Veterinary Service.Further training will be needed for a limited number of men (say 20-30 perannum for three or four years) to fill scientific and teaching posts.The demand for non-specialists will far exceed the-supply. The Colonial and home Animal Health Services could alone absorb within three years any suitablecandidates out of the 300-400 men engaged in war service, who are qualified or whose veterinary courses were interrupted.
(b) Engineering.The Committee have so far taken evidence from the Air Ministry, theMinistry of Aircraft Production, the Mechanical and the Electrical EngineeringAdvisory Committees to the Central (Technical and Scientific) Register of theMinistry of Labour and National Service, and the Radio Manufacturers&apos;Association.In some branches the output of qualified engineers has been substantially increased during the war, especially when the men trained in service courses, andin the Engineering Cadetship Scheme, are included.The war output can probably be absorbed after the war by providing practical and academic training in appropriate cases for those who have taken shortenedand specialised courses during the war.A permanently increased demand for qualified engineers, especially those with suitable training for production, management and administration, is to beexpected. Present indications are that an increase in the output of qualified,engineers up to 50 per cent, above the pre-war output is desirable and practicable.(c) Medicine and Dentistry.The Committee have taken evidence from the Ministry of Health, the Depart-ment of Health for Scotland and the Medical Research Council.Medical Practice.An Interdepartmental Committee, under the Chairmanship of Sir WilliamGoodenough, are considering the whole question of the training facilities in medical schools and the intake into the profession, and it is understood thattheir Report will be available shortly.Medical Research.The limiting factor- in finding the necessary personnel is likely to be therarity of the special ability for success in original research.Dentistry.Supply is expected to fall far short of the post-war demand. The subject isunder consideration by a Committee under Lord Teviot, with whom the Committeeare in touch.(d) Science.The Committee have taken evidence from The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.The Scientific Research and Chemistry Advisory Committees to theCentral (Technical and Scientific) Register of the Ministry of Labour and national Service.The Joint Council of Professional Scientists, andThe British Coal Utilisation Research Association.In some branches, the annual output from Universities has been substantially increased during the war.i .    .   ,.       1 Biological -          Agriculture. ! 0 .  0 0               i bciences. i                   j		Chemistry.

In view of thelimit to the number of persons of adequate quality for training, a doubling of
the output could probably not be achieved at any early date. In addition, inChemistry, Physics and Metallurgy, a further limitation may be set by trainingcapacity.Demand in the future will be for persons with suitable training for production management and administration, as well as for research. First degreecourses should, in general, be on broad and humane, rather than highly specialised,lines.Callings in which women are specially concerned.In general, evidence on particular callings covers the need both for men andfor women.The Committee have, in addition, taken evidence on the prospects of employ-ment and training for women from the Women&apos;s Employment Federation.APPENDIX III.Further Evidence Already in Preparation.A ccountants.From the Accountancy Advisory Committee to the Appointments Depart-ment of the Ministry of Labour and National Service.Ancillary Medical callings, including Pharmacy and Nursing.From the Ministry of Health, the Department of Health for Scotland, and professional bodies.Architects.From the Ministry of Works, the Ministry of HealtJh, the Ministry of Townand Country Planning, and the War Damage Commission.Commercial Art and Design.From the Board of Trade, and professional bodies.Economists and Statisticians.From the Royal Statistical Society and the National Service Committee for economic and Social Research.Engineering.From the Ministry of Works, the Civil Engineering- Advisory Committee tothe Central (Technical and Scientific) Register of the Ministry of Labour and national Service, and the Institutions of Civil, Mechanical and ElectricalEngineers.Insurance.From the Board of Trade, Institute of Actuaries, and Insurance representa-tives.Journalists.From the Journalists&apos; Advisory Committee to the Appointments Departmentof the Ministry of Labour and National Service.Legal Profession.From the Council of Legal Education, the Lord Advocate, the Law Society,and the General Council of Solicitors for Scotland.Linguists.From the Department of Overseas Trade, other Departments concerned, andthe Linguists&apos; Advisory Committee to the Appointments Department of theMinistry of Labour and National Service.Management (Commercial and Industrial).From the Board of Trade, the British Management Council, and the institute of Industrial Administration.
