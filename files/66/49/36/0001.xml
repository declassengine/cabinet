^w^\*V v&amp;^w^i^v^-Ji!-^ .THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.SECRET. Copy NoW.P. (44) 236.2nd May, 1944.WAR CABINET.DETENTION OF GANDHI.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate a telegram from the Government of India recommending that inthe altered circumstances due to the death of Mrs. Gandhi in February at theAga Khan&apos;s Palace in Poona, where she was detained with Gandhi and two orthree others, Gandhi should be transferred to Ahmednagar Fort, whereKalam Azad, Vallabhai Patel and other members of&apos; the Congress working committee are detained together.Since this telegram was received Gandhi&apos;s health has deteriorated seriouslythrough the after-effects of malaria. The latest medical reports show some improvement. Dr. B. C. Roy, an independent medical specialist, who hasexamined Gandhi, has urged his removal from the Aga Khan&apos;s Palace, which isin a malarial area, to a place where he will be free from further infection. It isclearly essential to move him for this reason. The Viceroy reports that Ahmed-nagar is a non-malarial area.The transfer to Ahmednagar could not of course be carried out withoutbecoming known, but it could be made plain that it carried no suggestion of anychange of policy. At the same time&apos;it would go some way to disarm .the criticswho assert that the continued refusal to allow consultation between Gandhi andthe Congress leaders is evidence that Government are determined to do nothing to &quot;break the deadlock,&quot; and rendered meaningless the Viceroy&apos;s invitation toco-operate and the Government&apos;s repeated statement that there can be no questionof releasing the Congress leaders so long as they show no inclination to abandon the policy of the resolution of August 1942.There is no doubt a risk that the result of putting Gandhi and the working committee in contact would be the development of some move calculated to embarrass the Government of India and His Majesty&apos;s Government. But theGovernment of India are confident that the advantages of the proposed transferoutweigh disadvantages of this nature. I therefore propose to telegraph myapproval of the proposal unless any of my colleagues notify the Secretary to theWar Cabinet by 6 p.m. on Thursday, the 4th May, that they desire the matter tobe brought up for discussion in the War Cabinet..  L. S. A.India Office, 2nd May, 1944.Telegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of State;dated 21th April.(No. 4905.)After Mrs, Gandhi&apos;s death Bombay Government suggested transfer of gandhi to Ahmednagar. Home Member was asked in Assembly on 15th Marchwhether Government intended to transfer Gandhi to some other place in viewof fact that he had lost &quot; two of his nearest and dearest life partners &apos;\ inAga Khan&apos;s Palace. He replied that suggestion would be considered. Gandhiasked in a letter dated 4th March to be transferred to ordinary jail ostensiblybecause he was horrified at expense of keeping him in Palace. Expense isconsiderable for small party that will now remain, but this is negligibleconsideration.[273761
22. We should not recommend transfer unless we were satisfied that advantage to Government lay in that course. Our original reasons for keepingGandhi separate from members of Working Committee were : (a) to preventconsultation and possible attempts from jail to promote movement and (b) tofacilitate handling of fast by Gandhi. We do not think either of these dangersis now great, and, even if Gandhi were to stage another fast at Ahmednagar orfall so seriously ill as to necessitate admission of visitors, he could be segregatedthere. We have rejected earlier requests from Gandhi to allow him to discuss matters with Working Committee, but permanent transfer would be on different footing from interview for political purposes. After transfer, which we shouldnot keep secret, Gandhi would have access to his colleagues, and excuse for )inability to reconsider their position would be removed.  We doubt whether any \change of heart would result, but there might be some manoeuvring for release,possibly on parole, in order to hold meeting of A.I.C.C. to reconsider position.We should have no hesitation in rejecting any such request unless intention towithdraw resolution of August 1942 was evident and appropriate assurancesfor future were given.3. We consider advantages of proposal outweigh disadvantages. Lesstrouble with Gandhi is to be anticipated than if we kept him in Palace with only two or three followers. We would send with him Miss Slade Pyarelal(Secretary) and Miss Nayyar (Lady Doctor).
