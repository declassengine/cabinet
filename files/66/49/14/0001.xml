THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJE^TY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   Apridm$secret. Copy No.W.P. (44) 214.20th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.REGISTRATION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTORS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.CIRCUMSTANCES have arisen which make it necessary for me, with regret, to submit to the Cabinet a proposal that a Bill should be introduced tomake an amendment of detail of the Parliament (Elections and Meetings) Act,1943, which received the Royal Assent on the 11th November last.1. This Act prescribed a new system of continuous registration of electors,and provided that the new system is to come into operation at an &quot; appointed day.&quot; The experience which has now been acquired of the preparations for bringing the new system into operation has shown that the clerical work involvedwill be in many areas very heavy, and it has been represented to me by the Clerksof the Peace of England and Wales that the work is much more voluminous andcomplicated than they had foreseen, that their staffs have been reduced to aminimum and in many places there are no officers of experience available to supervise the work, and that it is, they fear, inevitable that in some places therewill be a breakdown in the arrangements unless the scheme for which the Actprovides is simplified.A delay or breakdown in the clerical arrangements in any one constituencyhas the effect of preventing the Act from coming into operation, since the&apos;&apos; appointed day &apos;&apos; for the introduction of the new system cannot be fixed untilthe preparations are complete in every constituency, so that as from the&apos;&apos; appointed day&apos;&apos; elections can be conducted on the new system wherever suchelections may occur.2. The difficulties and complications involved in the clerical arrangements are due in the main to the provision in the Act of 1943 that there must be a two months&apos; period of residence as a qualification for a vote in a constituency,and that when a person has acquired by two months&apos; residence a qualificationin one constituency, his qualification to vote in that constituency continues until he becomes qualified in another constituency. The reasons why this provision asto two months&apos; residence complicates the clerical arrangements are explained inthe appended note.The two months&apos; residence qualification was recommended by theDepartmental Committee on Electoral Machinery as a feature of the schemewhich they devised for the purpose of a post-war general election. The committee did not contemplate the use of their new system of continuous registration forwar-time elections and, consequently, did not go into the question of the clericaldifficulties likely to arise under war conditions.3. The main advantage of the requirement of two months&apos; residence isthat it prevents the possibility of any attempt to introduce a number of temporaryresidents into a constituency for the purpose of enabling them to vote at aforthcoming election. It has, however, been pointed out that any such attemptcould be checked (without requiring two months&apos; residence) by making a smallalteration in the qualifying date. Under the scheme set out in the Act the qualifying date is the last day of the month next before that in-which the electionis initiated. (An election is &quot;initiated&quot; on the date on which the writ is received or, in the case of a General Election, on the date of the proclamation.)Accordingly, if an election is initiated in May the persons qualified to vote will,under the Act of 1943, be those who on the 30th April had been residing in the constituency for at least two months.The new proposal is that the qualifying date should be the last day of themonth next but one before that in which the election is initiated. Accordingly, inthe example quoted the persons who would be qualified to vote at an electioninitated in May would be the persons who were residing in the constituency onthe 31st Marchi. There would be no requirement as to length of residence, butit is unlikely that under such a scheme any arrangements could be made to[27316]
introduce persons into a constituency by the 31st March in order that they mayvote in an election which is initiated in May and for which the poll will not takeplace till June.4. The advantage of an amending Bill to give effect to this proposal is that,in addition to removing the serious risk of a breakdown in the clericalarrangements, it will enable the new scheme to be introduced for the purposes of by-elections earlier than would otherwise be possible. Under the Act, as it standsat present, the fixing of the &quot; appointed day &quot; is governed by the following considerations : first, the Home Office and the Scottish Office must be satisfiedthat the necessary preparatory work has been completed in every constituency,and, secondly, from the date at which the preparatory work has been completedthere must be a wait of two months in order to allow the two months&apos; residencequalification to mature. If the two months&apos; residence qualification is abolishedthe &quot; appointed day &quot; can be fixed without any wait as soon as the preparatory work has been completed.5. I am sorry that it should be necessary to propose an amending Bill, butthere is no other way of effecting the change. A Bill to make this alterationwould, I am advised, be short, and it should not, I think, be difficult to convinceParliament of its advantages.If my colleagues agree in principle to this suggestion, I would propose, beforethe Bill is introduced, to consult with representatives of the main political parties.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1,20th April, 1944.APPENDIX.The reasons why the abandonment of the two months&apos; residence qualificationwould reduce and simplify the work of the Electoral Registration Officers maybe summarised as follows : For the purpose of a system of continuous registration it is necessary that each Electoral Registration Officer shall have ready at the end of every month collection of cards properly sorted (according to districts and streets) showingthe names and addresses of all the people who will be entitled to vote in his con-stituency if an election should be initiated in the ensuing month, and changesmust be made from week to week in this collection as a result of deathsand removals. In the larger constituencies the removals amount to many hundredsper week.If the two months&apos; residence qualification be abandoned the task of keepingthese collections of cards up to date will be comparatively simple, since it will only be necessary to remove from the collection each month the cards of personswho had ceased to reside in the constituency on the last day of the penultimatemonth and to insert in the collection the cards of newcomers who were residing^in the constituency on that day.If, however, the two months&apos; residence qualification be retained, it isnecessary as regards each newcomer to keep his card for two months in a collectionof &quot; suspended &quot; cases, to note in a diary that his card has to be dealt with on aday two months later, to go through this diary day by day, to pick out each day from the suspense collection the maturing cards and to sort these cards into thecollection of cards of persons qualified to vote. In constituencies where theremovals run to many hundreds a week the volume and complexity of clericallabour entailed by these processes is great. Moreover, the two months&apos; residencequalification and the provision that a person who has acquired a qualification inone constituency does not lose that qualification until he has acquired a qualifi-cation in another constituency involves an elaborate system of notificationsbetween the Electoral Registration Officers and the Central Office of the NationalRegister. Notification must not only be sent that a person has removed fromconstituency &quot; A &quot; and has taken up residence in constituency &quot; B,&quot; but it mustbe ascertained whether he had qualified^to vote in constituency &quot; A,&quot; and theremust be further machinery to ascertain whether he has acquired a qualificationin constituency &quot; B.&quot; If, for example, he only resides for six weeks inconstituency &quot; B &quot; and then moves on to constituency &quot; C,&quot; he remains qualified to vote in constituency &quot; A &quot; until he has acquired a qualification in con-stituency &quot; C &quot; or some other constituency. The system of notifications requisiteto ensure that a person is not recorded as disqualified for one constituency until he has become qualified in another constituency is necessarily complex.
