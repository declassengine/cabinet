THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 208.11th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.FREE SIAMESE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN a memorandum dated the 3rd February (W.P. (44) 72) I submitted tomy colleagues a draft declaration concerning Siam, which I suggested, shouldbe made at an appropriate moment in the course of a general review of foreignaffairs. The immediate purpose of this declaration was to give encouragement to those Siamese who have enrolled in our forces and in other ways are assistingcertain organisations in their operations directed towards Siam. The issue of adeclaration is strongly supported by the Supreme Allied Commander, S.E.A.C.,and the Commander-in-Chief, India.2. I have since reached the conclusion that it will be more appropriate tomake such a declaration in answer to a Parliamentary Question. But before doing so I arranged that the United States Government should see the draft.The substance of their comment is that in its present form the declaration wouldnot encourage the Siamese people to resist the Japanese, might be exploitedby the latter, and would increase distrust in the United States and in Chinaand, elsewhere of the motives of Great Britain. If this declaration were made,the United States Government considered it advisable that it should include atleast an unequivocal commitment that Great Britain has no territorial ambitionsin Siam.3. The United States Government also gave a statement of their ownattitude towards Siam (see telegram No. 1357 from Washington, annexed hereto),and expressed the hope that if His Majesty&apos;s Government made a declaration itwould be one which they could match with a parallel declaration of their own.4. Since I am assured, that a declaration is desirable for operational reasons do not recommend to my colleagues that the proposal to make one should be dropped. Nor do I think we are called upon to include in the declaration any statement on territorial matters, since it has already been made clear in the Cairocommunique that we &quot;have no thought of territorial expansion.&quot; It seemsundesirable that we should commit ourselves as to the Siamese frontiers, not only because we do not recognise the transfers of territory from Indo-China and malaya made by the Japanese in 1941 and, 1943, but also because the requirementsof any international security system may make it desirable at some time toestablish international or &quot; United Nations &quot; bases in Siam.5. On the other hand, I think the tone and emphasis of the declaration canbe altered to bring it more closely into conformity with the statement of policywhich we have received from the United States Government and with the generalwording of the declaration on Austria, made at the Moscow Conference on the1st November, 1943. I therefore propose that in reply to a Question in parliament should make the following statement at an early date : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government favour the restoration to Siam, after thewar is over,.of complete security as a free, sovereign and independent State.They cannot, however, forget that the Government of Luang Pibul took12343   [27292]
the initiative in declaring war on us, in spite of Siam&apos;s treaty of non-aggression with us; and they would remind the Siamese people that they mustthemselves contribute to their liberation. In the final settlement accountwill inevitably be taken of the extent of that contribution.&quot;A. E.Foreign Office,V7tk April, 1944.ANNEX.Viscount Halifax to Mr. Eden.(No. 1357.)(Telegraphic.)       . Washington, ISth March, 1944.FOLLOWING- is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram : &quot; The United States has not declared war on Siam and is not at warwith Siam although the Siamese Government, after the Japanese occupationof Siam, declared war on the United States. We look forward to an earlyexpulsion from Siam of the Japanese invaders. Until the Japanese areexpelled from Siam we shall treat Siam for various purposes, includingeconomic and psychological warfare, as enemy-occupied territory. In anysituation in which Siamese nationals or groups actively engage in andco-operate with the Japanese in military operations, whether offensive ordefensive, against the forces of the United States or of other of the united nations, and in any situation in which the presence of Siamese armed forcesobstructs operations or threatens the security of the forces of the united nations, we shall treat those Siamese forces as enemy.&quot; The United States continues to regard Siam as an independent State.We do not recognise the present Siamese Government. We continue torecognise as &quot; Minister of Siam &quot; the Siamese Minister in Washington, whohas denounced his Government&apos;s co-operation with Japan. We regard withsympathy a Free Siamese movement in which the Siamese Minister in washington is a prominent figure. We have not made, and we do not contemplate making, any political commitment to any particular Siamesenational or Siamese group prejudicing the future political situation asbetween or amongst Siamese political aspirants. We favour the restorationto Siam of complete security as a sovereign State, and we favour the creationin Siam of a Government which will represent the free-will of the Siamesepeople.&apos;&apos;
