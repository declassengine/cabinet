THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.SECRET. / Copy No.W.P. (44) 232. \/28th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.THE question of our post-war policy in regard to coal exports is of such general importance that I feel it necessary to bring the matter to the notice ofthe War Cabinet.2.   The facts about pre-war coal exports were as follows : (a) For five years prior to the last war we exported at the average rate of65 million tons per year. The figure rose to nearly 80 million tonsin 1923, but after 1931 it only once reached 40 million tons. In 1938we exported 35,856,000 tons and in addition shipped 10,488,949 tons for the use of steamers engaged in the foreign trade.(b) In 1938 about 25 per cent, of our exports went to the Baltic, 40 per cent.to the North Sea, English Channel and the Irish Sea, 15 per cent, tothe Western Mediterranean and 5 per cent, to the Eastern Mediter-ranean. France has always been our largest customer. The great bulk of our exports went to areas outside the sterling currency.(c) The average f .o.b. price per ton was 13s. lOd. in 1913, 20s. lOd. in 1938and is now 33s., which, however, does not include any further increase(perhaps 2s.) such as may be necessary to pay for the recent increases in wages due to the Porter awards and the new wages Agreement.(d) During the war our exports have been reduced to negligible proportionsowing to shipping difficulties and the shortage of coal at home.3. The decline of coal exports between the wars was due to such factors asthe operation of European coalfields at costs that were low relative to those ofthis country, the development of new coalfields in Europe, and also, especiallyin the later years, the policy of &apos;&apos; dumping &apos;&apos; coal abroad at uneconomic prices by autarkic countries such as Germany. The effect of these factors was, however,checked in the middle 1930s by :(a) bilateral agreements between the United. Kingdom and certain coal-importing countries, by which these countries were pledged, in returnfor trade concessions on our part, to take specific minimumproportions of their coal imports from this country;(b) an Agreement, concluded in 1934 and renewed in 1937, between theUnited Kingdom coal industry and the Polish coal industry, whichapportioned certain common markets in agreed shares. In addition,negotiations for a European Coal Marketing Agreement were far advanced, in 1939 between the coal industries of Poland, Germany andthis country, with the object on our side of maintaining our share ofthe European coal markets.4. In the immediate period after the end of the war with Germany, theremay well be considerable difficulty in meeting the European &quot; relief &quot; commit-ments for coal, and, if the Germans destroy the French and other mines on a large scale, there is likely to be a world shortage of coal for a few years in the transitionbetween the relief period and the long-term post-war period. In that event, ifwe can produce coal surplus to our needs, we should expect little difficulty indisposing of it.5.   There are many uncertain factors which make it difficult to forecast thedemand for coal after the transition period.   If the full employment policy issuccessful, there may be a continuing difficulty in attracting sufficient men to the mines, even with guaranteed high wages.  To supply, in addition to a heavy home[27366]   . .
demand, a considerable coal export market might, under full employment con-ditions, mean a difficult man-power problem. But if the full.employment policy isnot successful, particularly in the areas near the pits, there may be a serioussurplus of coal, due to the inadequacy of inland industrial demand, and to theinflux of men into the mines. ,6. The following considerations, however, would make it difficult, even iffull employment were maintained, to view with equanimity a further reductionin coal exports in face of the following considerations :  (a) The sale of coal is one of our main sources of foreign exchange, corfes-ponding to an average of about  34 million in the five years before thewar.(b) Certain coalfields depend particularly on the coal export trade.   SouthWales would find it very difficult to dispose of its anthracite and lowvolatile &quot; steam &quot; coal in the home market, unless and until therewere considerable shifts in the pattern of home demand; Durhamis specially laid out for the export market. Whatever the full employ-ment position, there will, I think, be local dislocation i and unemployment in these coalfields, and also in East Scotland, unlesscoal exports can be maintained. These coalfields are now classed as&quot;Development Areas.&quot;7. Unfortunately, I fear that the competitive position of British coal,vis-a-vis European coal, after the war is likely to be severely handicapped. even before the war our costs of production were above those of most Continentalfields, and after the war they are likely to be relatively much higher still. Wagesconstitute an exceptionally large element in the price of coal. The recent wageagreement stabilises miners&apos; wages at their present high level for four years,and I would not expect a substantial fall in wages to be possible after thatperiod. In time, no doubt, this factor may be offset in some measure by greaterproductive efficiency, but this will take time and it must not be forgotten thatsome of our coalfields are old and that the geological conditions are gettingincreasingly adverse.8. What is the bearing of the commercial and commodity discussions onthe coal export problem ? The coal export trade of this country would no doubtderive certain advantages from the general adoption of the policy of theWashington discussions. The Poles and the Germans would be precluded from&quot; dumping &quot; and other practices, which injured our industry before the war.On the other hand, I am afraid that this advantage would be more than offset by the high price of British coal, so that our coal export trade may require some artificial stimulus if it is to survive. In this regard, it appears from the.Washington discussions that we shall be precluded from (a) Bilateral agreements of the type which were of great assistance to ourcoal export trade in the pre-war years.(b) Export subsidies.(c) A European Coal Agreement, sharing out markets under some system: of quotas.   I am not quite clear, however, whether such an agreement would, in fact, be precluded under the present proposals.9. Both sides of the coal industry, and the mining Members, will undoubtedly expect us to do everything possible to maintain the coal exporttrade. In view of the secrecy of the Washington discussions, I have not beenable to discuss the proposals with the industry, but they are almost certain topress for a policy allowing bilateral arrangements and some sort of a european coal Agreement. In addition, I have even seen it suggested that some special provision, safeguarding our coal export trade, should be included in thePeace Treaty. -10. While I endorse the general principles in the Memorandum submittedby the Minister of War Transport (W.P. (44) 227), I find it difficult to see whatsolution an unqualified multilateral policy would offer to the special price problemof the coal export trade of this country. In view of the important issues involved,therefore, I would suggest to my colleagues that it may be advisable to reservecoal from the present stage of the discussions on post-war Commercial Policy.-&apos; O.
