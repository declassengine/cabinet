SHIS DOCUMENT IS TH&amp; PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT1. The Cabinet Committee on Indian Foodgrain Requirements met on the6th April and considered telegram No. 628 of the 25th March from the Viceroy,a copy of which is annexed as Appendix I. Sir Archibald Rowlands, adviser tothe Viceroy on War Administration, reported orally to the Committee LordWavell&apos;s view that, failing the imports he asked for, the risk of breakdown was so serious and its effects would be so widely felt that, in his opinion, the Govern-ment of the United States should be associated with His Majesty&apos;s government if India&apos;s requests had to be rejected. Refusal meant not merely a shortage forthe Army, but grave risk of a failure of procurement both at the Centre arid inthe Provinces, with a recurrence of last year&apos;s disasters and failure of India asa base.2. The Minister of War Transport made it clear that no shipping could befound for the transport of food grains to India beyond the present programmeexcept by cutting operational needs.3. The Secretary of State for War pointed out that the Viceroy wasconstitutionally subject to direction by the Secretary of State for India, and thatin the last resort it would be for His Majesty&apos;s Government to decide whetherthe available supplies in India were to be applied to the Defence Forces or thecivil population.4. After discussion, the conclusion was reached that three possible coursesare open :-(a) that the Viceroy should be instructed that the Government of India mustfind from Indian sources the wheat required for the military demandeven at the expense of the essential needs of the civil population inIndia. It was recognised that this course might have serious politicaland economic repercussions and might seriously jeopardise India&apos;economic stability as a base for operations;(b) that the shipping required to carry the additional wheat importsrequested by the Viceroy should be supplied by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, though the Committee were agreed that this could only be done at the expense of some operational programme;(c) that a request for assistance should be made to the Americans.The Committee felt that they could not make any recommendation to theWar Cabinet and agreed that the choice between these alternatives could onlybe taken by the War Cabinet.5. I have now received from the Viceroy the two telegrams annexed as appendices II and III. These show that owing to damage to the spring cropsfrom bad weather there has been a serious worsening of the situation. So far asthe estimates of damage can be converted into actual figures of grain, theestimates show a deficiency of about 10 per cent, from the normal. That means that instead of nearly 25 million tons of grain from the spring crops we cannotlook for much more than 22-1 million tons. In the present food situation inIndia this is a serious position.Printed for the War Cabinet. A/pril 19,44-SECRET.Copy NoW.P.

6. The expectation is that the producing provinces will not be able to spare more than 650,000 tons this year as against the 900,000 tons anticipated in the Viceroy&apos;s telegram of the 25th March, a copy of which is appended for convenience of reference. Moreover, losses of barley, gram and millet have destroyed the expectation that surpluses of these grains could be used as substi-tutes to fill the requirements of the deficit provinces to an amount of 150,000 tons.Other increased requirements bring the total needed for the deficit provincesto 250,000 tons. Civil requirements for the deficit areas are thus increased from550,000 to 800,000 and there are 50,000 tons destroyed in the Bombay fire to bereplaced. The result is thus a net worsening of 550,000 tons and the Viceroynow, in addition to the 200,000 tons promised, requires not 174,000 tons of wheatbut 724,000 tons of wheat if the minimum needs of the civil population are to bemet and the army are also to receive their requirements.7. The estimated requirements and supplies of wheat available for the next twelve months as put forward on 25th March and as now revised are as in the table below. The figures of requirements make no provision for the reserves which are most desirable to support procurement and price control: Estimate on Estimate on25th March.   19th April.(Thousands of tons.)1.

In my view and that of my colleagues on the Sub-Committee theViceroy&apos;s further telegrams do not affect our conclusion as reported in para-graph 4 above. I submit, however, that the damage to the crops now reportedgreatly increases the dangers of the situation and that the position is too seriousto be left where it is.X. S. A.India Office, S.W.1,21st April, 1944.   -
(Note. All figures of requirements and estimates of supplies in these telegramsare in thousands of tons.)APPENDIX I........ Telegram from Viceroy, dated 25th March.No. 628-S. - - . -Your telegram 6904 of 22nd March. Food imports. Imports of 200,000tons wheat in the second and third quarter (?s of 1944) in addition to 50,000 tonsalready arranged will ease immediate difficulties. But I wish to make it quite clear to His Majesty&apos;s Government that they have not solved the Indian foodproblem or secured India as a military base during 1944 by imports of. this sizewhich are one-sixth of India&apos;s real requirements and one-half of the minimum which I postulated as essential for the next six months. ........2. See paragraphs 4 to 9 of my 459-S of 4th March. On the latest wheatforecast and offers from the provinces I am prepared to put procurement at 900.Taking civil requirements for deficit areas at the rock bottom figure of 550balance available for defence services is 350. But (?demands) of defence services are 724 leaving deficit of nearly 400 with no provision for reserve. Import of200 only covers about one-half of deficit. Import of 50 promised by the end ofApril has already been allotted and is excluded from the calculation.3. Announcement of import of 200 will thus have no real effect on procure-ment or prices. Nor can we raise figures to 400 on the understanding that we will export rice to Ceylon in exchange for additional 150. It will be quite impossible to consider any export of rice for some time, in fact until popularconfidence is entirely restored. Although rice crop is good, normal carry-overC?has) vanished and will undoubtedly be replaced by retention in cultivators&apos;hands of proportion of crop equivalent to or (?greater) than normal carry-over which may amount to 4-5 million tons in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Assam.Until it is seen how Bengal procurement scheme goes (and as I have informed youit is going badly at present) any attempt to export rice would fail and wouldhave disastrous effects in driving all rice underground. There is crisis in ricesupply and prices in Bihar at present due to lack of confidence in Bengal procure-ment scheme and belief that famine conditions will recur in Bengal.4. My conclusion is that we need at least 200 additional wheat in 1944for bare needs of civil population and defence services (?and that) no part ofthis can be balanced by exports. This will still leave us without any reserve tomeet contingencies or to control prices.5. Before receipt of your telegram I was about to inform supreme commander and Commander-in-chief that of the 724 required for services in1944 I could supply only 350. I will now inform them that 550 can be supplied.I must also inform (?them that) in view of the failure of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to supply imports I have, gravest apprehension of the economic situationin India this autumn (?and of) its stability as a base. I must leave it to supreme commander to what extent he informs Americans of this position (?but it)obviously concerns their troops vitally.6. Sir A. Rowlands is flying home shortly and I am giving him details ofthe position. Frankly, I am unable to understand His Majesty&apos;s Government^failure to approach Americans for assistance (?in) shipping since they are unableto supply it themselves. India is a combined base for the Allied effort against japan, and failure to maintain stability will affect the Allied war effort. UnlessHis Majesty&apos;s Government regard my opinion expressed in a number of telegramsas (?worthless) I feel it is incumbent on them to inform Combined Chiefs ofStaff of my views direct rather than leave information to come to Washingtonindirectly as I expect it is bound to do as the result of the warning I mustdeliver to Supreme Commander.[27317]
APPENDIX II.Telegram from the Viceroy dated \%th April.No. 805-S.When shall I get further decision on food imports ? We have had in Marchand early April quite unprecedented rain with thunderstorms and hail over large part of India. Estimates of damage can only be approximate, but on the bestinformation at present available following modifications are needed in wheatfigures given in my 459-S of 4th March and 628-S of 25th March. All figures inthousand tons.2. Procurement. Estimate in my 628-S, 900. United Provinces havesuspended 20 from current crop quota and cancelled 100 from new crop quota.Punjab have cancelled 100 for improvement over original declared surplus onwhich we were counting. Reports from States of Central India and Rajputanaare incomplete, but reduction not likely to be less than 30. Total reduction fromsurplus areas due to unseasonable weather 250. Revised estimate forprocurement 650.3. Requirements. Damage to barley, gram and millets cancels 150estimated in paragraph 7 of my 459-S. Central Provinces report additionaldeficit of 73. Ajmer-Merwara requires additional 5 and Madras 25 to compensate for loss of jowar. Total worsening 253 or, say, 250. Civil requirements fordeficit areas thus increased from 550 to 800. This does not allow for deterioration-tion which has been reported in Bombay Presidency, for which accurate figuresnot yet available.4. We are thus worse off by 500 than when last estimate was made, and minimum civil requirements now exceed procurement by 150. We have, inaddition, to replace stocks lost in Bombay fire amounting approximately to 50.5. Promised import of 200 just balances civil position with nothing to meetdefence requirements of 724 for 12 months from 1st May, and whole of this amount must be imported if Army demands are to be met.6. Casey is doing all he can in Bengal, but only about 270 rice and paddyso far procured against his reduced target of 600. If he holds situation andprevents famine in Bengal he will be doing all we can expect. I have helpedCeylon with emergency loan of 5 rice.7. I am clear we now need 724 tons of wheat in addition to 200 promisedif civil population and Army are to be fed. Matter is not one for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment alone as United Nations are deeply involved in operations here.I must press once more for urgent decision in consultation with Americans.8. There is growing state of nervousness in India about food position dueto knowledge of slow procurement in Bengal, Bombay disaster and especiallyreports of insufficient imports. As I have repeatedly warned you, success of ourprocurement and controls depends entirely on public confidence. Only method of restoring and maintaining confidence is to announce that imports sufficient tocover calculated deficit have been arranged. Food Department point out thatour demands are well within estimate of Food Grain Policy Committee whichthey have consistently supported since July and correctness of which has beenborne out by events. Government of India having accepted Committee&apos;srecommendations, are under constant pressure to disclose import position.9. I am informing Supreme Commander and C.-in-C. of inability of Indiato meet service requirements.--APPENDIX III.Telegram from Government of India Food Department, dated ldth April.No. 4534.Following is summary of reports so far received of damage to crops by recentweather : Punjab. Wheat. Rain heavier in sub-Montane and. South-Easterndistricts than in main producing areas and canal colonies. More advanced cropshave been battered&apos; by hail locally and yield will be greatly reduced, but late sownwheat in Northern areas has benefited. Benefit and damage will about cancelout but no increase possible over original estimate of exportable surplus as stormsand hot winds may yet cause further damage.Gram. There has been very serious damage particularly in heaviestproducing areas.  Loss may exceed 50 per cent, of whole crop. il
United Provinces. There was repeated local rainfall from middle Marchand general rain with some hail on 27th March, 28th March, 19th March,2nd April and 23rd April. In Eastern districts some of crops had been garneredand is safe. Most damage in central districts where harvested crop was lyingin fields on threshing floors. Less damage in Meerut, Agra, Rohilkhand, Lucknowand Northern Fyzabad divisions where crop was largely unreaped. Damage tobarley and gram was more severe than to wheat. Whereas, generally better rabicrop than normal was expected, present estimate is that wheat will be 10 per cent.,barley 20 per cent, and gram 25 per cent, below normal. In many areas wheredamaged grain is (? fit) for (? consumption) rain has spoilt straw for fodderand grain for seed. There is likely to be serious loss of efficacy for seed purposes and of straw for fodder.North-West Frontier Province. Crop probably not sufficiently advanced tohave suffered serious damage, but harvest will be retarded. Flow of wheat fromrural to urban areas has fallen sharply.Sind. Estimates damage to wheat crop at 7 per cent, and gram crop at10 per cent.Central Provinces. Damage to wheat and rabi jowar crops is serious. InSaugar Chindwvry [sic] Mandla, important wheat-producing districts, damage to late sown wheat by rust expected to reduce crop to between 50 and 70 per cent,of normal. Rabi jowar production in Chander and Bhandari greatly reduced.Net loss of rabi food grains as result of unseasonable weather estimated at250,000 tons.Madras. Reports partial failure of rains in four districts and very adverse effects of recent unseasonable rain generally and insect pest which has turnedexpected fair millet crops to heavy deficit.Ajmer-Merwara. Damage by rain reported from all parts and in certainvillages crops completely wiped out by hail. Due to unsettled weather, crops arebeing harvested before fully matured.Central India. Owing to untimely rain and hail prospects of harvesting an excellent rabi crop have disappeared, rust will materially affect wheat product.Hyderabad. Very unusual heavy rain and hail storms have damagedstanding millets and second rice crops. Rabi jowar crop now being harvestedis not expected to exceed 7 annas (about 40 per cent, of normal). No suppliesof millets can be expected from Hyderabad for basic plan. Damage to secondrice crops by storms may necessitate further allotment of rice to Hyderabad.
