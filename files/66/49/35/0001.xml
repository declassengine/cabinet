cabTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT149Printed for the War Cabinet.   May 1944.Copy No.    *J 0WAR CABINET.PROPOSED THREE-POWER DECLARATION REGARDINGSATELLITES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.In accordance with the War Cabinet&apos;s decision of the 27th April(W.M. 57 (44) Minute 1)1 arranged with the Soviet and United States Govern-ments to postpone the issue of the proposed Declaration to the Axis satellites, the text of which it was felt required amendment.2. I. have confined my amendments to the second paragraph of the preamble and the third, fourth and fifth clauses of the Declaration itself, which appeared to me to be the passages most needing alteration.3. My colleagues will recall that they felt that clause 3 of the declaration was particularly unhappy.   I propose to omit it altogether.4. Attached is the text as it originally stood (Annex I) together with myredraft (Annex II) which I would propose, with the approval of my colleagues,to submit to the Soviet and United States Governments for their consideration.A. E.Foreign Office, 1st May, 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 235.1st May, 1944.ANNEX I.Original Text.Through the fateful policy of their leaders,, the people of Hungaryare suffering the humiliation of German occupation. Roumania is still boundto the Nazis in a war now bringing devastation to its own people. The Govern-ments of Bulgaria and Finland have placed their countries in the service ofGermany and remain in the war at Germany&apos;s side.In order to point out the road to freedom for these unhappy victims of hitler &apos;s evil devices and again to give them warning at this late hour, theUnited Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States have agreed that:  (1) The Axis satellites, Hungary, Roumania, Bulgaria and Finland, despite their realisation of the inevitability of a crushing Nazi defeat andtheir desire to get out of the war, are by their present policies andattitudes contributing materially to the strength of the German warmachine.(2) These nations still have it within their .power, by withdrawing from thewar and ceasing their collaboration with Germany and byresisting the forces of Nazism by every possible means,&quot; to shorten the European struggle, diminish their own ultimate sacrifices andcontribute to the Allied victory.[27391]
(3) The prospects of these countries for future existence as independent states, the right freely to choose their own Governments, the preservation-tion of their rightful territories, and the avoidance of militarydevastation cannot be enhanced but only diminished by their continued collaboration with Nazi Germany.(4) There is no question but that the longer these nations continue. their participation in the war and their collaboration with Germany themore disastrous will be the consequences to them and the morerigorous will be the terms which will be imposed upon them.(5) The responsibility of Hungary, Roumania, Bulgaria and Finland fortheir participation in the war at the side of Nazi Germany placesupon them the necessity of deciding now, while yet there is time forthem to contribute to the inevitable Allied victory whether they wishto persist in their misguided and calamitous course.ANNEX II.Proposed Redraft.Through the fatal policy of their leaders, the people of Hungary are suffering the humiliation of German occupation. Roumania is still bound to the nazis in a war now bringing devastation to its own people. The Governmentsof Bulgaria and Finland have placed their countries in the service of Germanyand remain in the war at Germany&apos;s side.The Governments of Great Britain, the Soviet Union and the United Statesthink it right that these peoples should, realise the following facts : (1) The Axis satellites, Hungary, Roumania, Bulgaria and Finland, despite their realisation of the inevitability of a crushing Nazi defeat andtheir desire to get out of the war, are by their present policies andattitudes contributing materially to the strength of the German warmachine.(2) These nations still Jhave it within their power, by withdrawing from thewar and ceasing their collaboration with Germany and by resistingthe forces of Nazism by every possible means, to shorten the Europeanstruggle, diminish their own ultimate sacrifices and contribute to theAllied victory.(3) These nations will be held responsible for having participated in thewar at the side of Nazi Germany, and the longer they continue at war in collaboration with Germany the more disastrous will be theconsequences to them and the more rigorous will be the terms whichwill be imposed upon them.(4) These nations must therefore decide now, while yet there is time forthem to contribute to the inevitable Allied victory, whether they intend to persist in their present hopeless and calamitous policy of opposing&quot; that victory. -I.
