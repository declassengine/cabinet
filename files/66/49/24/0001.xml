THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet. April 1944.COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.IN the debate on Empire Co-operation on the 21st April the Prime ministers aid: &quot;I am convinced that there should be a careful, searching, far-rangingdiscussion on the economics of the post-war world.&quot; This clearly implied thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government would not commit themselves to any definite or final conclusion of policy before this discussion has taken place.The President of the Board of Trade now asks in paragraph 15 of his latestmemorandum (W.P. (44) 217) that we should definitely commit ourselves in discussion with the Dominion Prime Ministers to the proposals for commercial policy, hitherto conducted on the official level, and summarised in his memo-randum. This seems to me entirely inconsistent with the Prime Ministersdeclaration. It seems to me equally inconsistent with the declared attitude ofthe Government on the Monetary Fund Scheme, namely, that it is in no way committed. Surely the right course is for both schemes to be submitted for dis-cussion by the Empire Prime Ministers on the clear understanding that this government is not committed until there has been the &quot; careful, searching, far-ranging discussion &apos;&apos; by Parliament and the public which the Prime Minister hasenvisaged.So far, indeed, as the debate gave an indication of the results of such discus-sion it would certainly not lead to the conclusion that the proposed commercial union scheme would be found acceptable, so far at any rate as it contemplates adefinite reduction of Imperial Preference to some such token figure as 5 per cent.ad valorem.I have already set out in a number of memoranda the fundamental objectionsto the proposed Commercial Union project, and do not feel it necessary to repeatthem. I would only draw attention once more to the fact that, in stating the&quot;main requirements of our post-war commercial policy,&quot; the President of theBoard of Trade provides no sort of estimate as to the extent to which ourproblematical gain from the lowering of tariffs, on most-favoured-nation lines,under the proposed Commercial Union would compensate (a) for the loss in our exports to the Empire resulting from the reduction of preference and (b) from thedebits to our balance of trade position resulting from the limitation of our freedom to protect our own industries and agriculture by whatever methods maybe necessary for that purpose. These debits would, of course, have to be subtractedfrom the credits gained by our exports before these exports are available topurchase the raw materials and additional food-stuffs essential to our existence.In paragraph 2 (c) of his memorandum the President of the Board of Tradesays that there are to be no more most-favoured-nation arrangements of the oldtype. But obviously the most-favoured-nation clause is to apply as among thenations joining the proposed union. These are ex hypothesi (see paragraph 11)to be a substantial majority of the more important economic States. Apparently,moreover, it is understood that our defeated enemies are to be admitted to membership in pursuance of the Atlantic Charter, and, indeed, the commercial union discussions have suggested that they should be compelled to join. It isdifficult to see what advantage we could get out of a lowering of the Japanesetariff. to compensate for increased Japanese competition in home and Empiremarkets as well as for Japanese competition on equal terms in the other markets of the Commercial Union.L. S. A.India Office, 25th April, 1944.100SECRET. Copy No.     3 6W.P. (44) 224.25*A April, 1944.WAR CABINET.[27342]
