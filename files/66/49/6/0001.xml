(44) 206.17th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-AMERICAN DIFFERENCES OVER BLOCKADE MEASURES.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.UNTIL recently His Majesty&apos;s Government have, been in general agree-ment with the United States Government on the methods of achieving our common aim of reducing to the absolute minimum supplies to Germany fromthe neutrals. There has, however, now arisen between us a difference as to policy so fundamental, and involving such serious considerations, that I mustbring it to the attention of my colleagues. This difference at present relates to Spain and Sweden.   It may shortly extend to Portugal as well.2. Some six months ago the United States Administration decided thatthe time had come to &apos;&apos; cash in &apos;&apos; on the improved military situation of theAllies. There has been no disagreement between us on this point. Ourdivergence of views is as to the extent to which in &quot; cashing in,&quot; we can-ignoreany agreements with the Governments of the countries concerned, the differentnational characteristics and political structure of those countries, .the advice ofour diplomatic representatives, our own supply requirements, and the risk ofill-considered action resulting in much greater supplies reaching the enemy thanat present.3. In November last the Americans requested the Spaniards to place an embargo on the export of wolfram to the enemy. They did not ask us to associateourselves with this request at the time, though they kept us fully informed,and, in fact, we were then making upon the Spanish political demands to whichHis Majesty V Government attached even greater importance; but in Januarywe instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to support the American demand fora reply to their request. At the same time we agreed that all shipments of oil to Spain should be stopped.4. Sir S. Hoare fully agreed with this action but suggested strongly thatthe stoppage of oil should not be linked with the wolfram embargo in any com-munication to the Spanish Government, and above all that all publicity shouldbe avoided. The State Department apparently agreed with His Majesty&apos;ambassador, but almost immediately afterwards without any further consulta-tion with us they announced in Washington that all shipments of oil to Spainhad been suspended pending a reconsideration of American trade and general relations with Spain.5. This publicity has made our negotiations extremely difficult, but inspite of this (the Americans doubtless will say because of this), our Ambassadorinduced the Spaniards to place a temporary embargo on wolfram exports whichis still in force and has secured a most reasonable offer from Jordana. TheState Departments refusal to allow the Spaniards to save their faces by makinga token shipment to Germany of 60 tons over the next three months, and their[27286]
insistence on a complete embargo up to at least the 30th June, has so far made an agreement impossible and there is, in our view, a grave risk that the pro-German elements in Spain may get the upper hand, put an end to our negotiations,and send Germany the large stocks of wolfram (including 700 tons on the frontier)which are now awaiting transport. We shall in any case need as much Spanishgoodwill as we can keep, in order to check wolfram smuggling, which, owingto the very high price of the mineral, is a most remunerative occupation.6. An even worse situation has arisen in Sweden. Under the Anglo-American-Swedish Economic Agreement, negotiated in London last May, the swedes agreed to make, during 1944, very substantial reductions in their tradewith the Axis. In particular they undertook to limit their deliveries to Axiscountries during 1944 of ball and roller bearings to a total value of 29 millionkronor. This compares with 51 million kronor in 1942 and 60 million kronorin 1943.7. During the latter half of 1943 the Germans made frantic efforts to induce the Swedes to increase their deliveries of bearings. In August they offeredDaimler-Benz aero-engines, and in December they were prepared to add. heavy a.A. guns or any other armaments which the Swedes desired. These offers were refused. In January, the Swedes signed a commercial agreement with theGermans providing for deliveries to Germany during 1944 to the value of 14-5 million Reichsmarks. They have also entered into agreements for small deliveries to other Axis countries. The total amount of all these commitments to AxisEurope is a little over 26 million kronor. The Swedes have recently promised us that deliveries in any one month shall not exceed one-twelfth of the Germanannual quota, and that the Germans will not be allowed to switch their orders from one type of bearing to another, except for such minor alterations as arenormal in the trade.8. It is true that the Swedish supplies remain of considerable importanceto the enemy. While they represent only about 8 per cent, of the total Germanconsumption of ball bearings, in January last the Germans obtained from Swedenroughly 22 per cent, of their total monthly supply of certain important types offuselage bearings. In view of the bomber offensive against the German aircraft industry and also against ball-bearing plants, both the British and American airstaffs attach the highest importance to stopping or slowing up these deliveries,especially during the next three or four months. We have therefore beenendeavouring to find out whether there is any way in which the Swedes couldbe prevailed upon to make still further reductions. Early in March we suggested to the Swedish Government that they might requisition, ostensibly for their own purposes, bearings ordered by the enemy, and that in return we might be able togive them a number of Spitfires. With obvious reluctance they turned this offerdown. It was then proposed that an approach should be made to SKF (theSwedish ball-bearing monopoly), who should be offered substantial orders in 1944and 1945 if they would discontinue or greatly diminish their deliveries to Germanyover the next three months. With the agreement of the American Embassy inLondon this suggestion was discussed by His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Stockholmwith Mr, Wallenberg, who was one of the Swedish Delegation to London lastyear, and who is closely connected both with SKF and with the Swedish Govern-ment. There is reason to think that this approach might have produced someresults. But before this could be ascertained Washington declared, itself infavour of a formal approach to the Swedish Government, demanding animmediate cessation of all ball-bearing exports to Germany, and threatening thatif the demand were not met the SKF firm would be blacklisted. We were not-sanguine, about such a demarche, and would greatly have preferred the approach to the Company through Wallenberg. But since it was clear that the americans were ready to act alone, and since they would have attributed their subsequentfailure to achieve their objective to the fact that our support had been withheld,we considered that the best course was to associate ourselves with the demarche,provided that the threat to blacklist SKF, was omitted. This was accordinglydone.9. It is highly probable that we shall receive a rebuff, in which eventWashington is urging us to agree to blacklist SKF. They have told us that ifwe refuse they will proceed alone.
10. Undoubtedly SKF are vulnerable to listing, since they have considerableproperty, both in the United Kingdom and in the United States. It is therefore not quite inconceivable that a threat of listing would constrain them to meet our wishes. But they would certainly be guided by the Swedish Government and,in their present temper, it is improbable that the Swedes would submit to pressure of this kind.   The disadvantages of the course proposed are as follows :-(a) SKF supplies us with substantial quantities of ball bearings, some ofwhich are used for our latest type of aircraft engines now going into production. If the firm were blacklisted these supplies would almost certainly stop forthwith.(b) The Swedish Government might well be goaded into denouncing theWar Trade Agreement. If they did so, the whole production ofSKF would be diverted to the enemy, including that which has hitherto been available to us. Instead of obtaining 26 million kronor&apos;s worth of ball and roller bearings in 1944, the enemy might well obtain over100 million.(c) The effect on our relations with Sweden might be disastrous.   In theeconomic sphere the Swedes have gone further to meet our wishes than any other neutral country. Last year&apos;s agreement, under which theSwedish Government agreed to a 30 per cent, reduction of their exporttrade with the Axis, involves considerable dislocation and possibleunemployment in almost every Swedish industry. The trickle ofsupplies which can reach Sweden from overseas by no means com-pensates for these sacrifices. The Swedes certainly expected someshow of gratitude on the part of the British and American Govern-ments. Instead, as the result of American intransigence, they havebeen subjected, ever since the agreement was signed, to a series ofpin-pricks, and there has always been the danger that, without consulting us, Washington would suddenly cut off Swedish overseassupplies.11. I do not overlook the immense importance of keeping on the best possible terms with the Americans; nor the pressure to which the State Depart-ment is subject before the Presidential election; nor the point of view of theAmerican Air Force, which has suffered heavy losses in destroying ball-bearingworks in German Europe. But where we are convinced that we are being askedto take action which is wrongly conceived and likely to help the enemy, I thinkthat we should take a firm stand. We are informing the Americans of the reasons why we are opposed to blacklisting SKF. If the Swedes accept the demandsreferred to in paragraph 8 above, no question of blacklisting the firm will arise.But if the Swedes turn down the demands and the Americans still persist, i recommend that we should refuse to place the firm on our own list. I alsorecommend that we should decline to acquiesce in any measures (such as cutting/off Swedish rations) which, in our opinion, would justify the Swedes indenouncing last year&apos;s agreement.12. We ai&apos;e, it seems to me, in danger of being dragged round Europe atthe heels of the United States and made to pursue, in the name of economic warfare, a policy which will probably fail to achieve its objects; will redound toour discredit; and will in the end make it difficult for us to negotiate furtheragreements, since people will cease to believe that we shall honour our word inspirit as well as in letter.- S.Ministry of Economic Warfare, W. 1,17th April, 1944.&quot;
