THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 203.13th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries.IT is clear from the Summary included in the Secretary of State for theDominions&apos; Paper (W.P. (44) 192) that, in the opinion of the experts at all events, the United States desire the substantial elimination of imperial preference as against merely its modification, and that they are not likely toagree to any arrangement that involves the retention of residual preferencesexcept within very narrow limits. As I understand it* the more drastic ofthe formulas recently discussed would still leave the American tariff rates on many items as high as 25 per cent. I cannot imagine that public opinion in thiscountry would agree that a maintenance of United States tariff at 25 per cent,was a fair quid pro quo for our agreeing to virtual elimination of imperial preference.2. It is also clear from the discussions that the Dominions are by no meansenthusiastic about the proposals as they stand.3. It is also clear that while the Dominion officials may be agreed in general on a multilateral approach to the reduction of harmful barriers to trade, themajority of them are not without anxiety as to the possible effects of the, present proposals on their internal economies, and they have entered reservations of one,kind or another to meet their own special circumstances.  Thus -Australia is doubtful about the desirability of applying a general formula for tariff reductions regardless of its effect on individual industries.New Zealand will probably wish to make more extensive use of state trading in order to safeguard her interests.India has made it clear that important exceptions must be made to meet herspecial conditions.4. The general conclusion of the officials who took part in the recent discussions is that the outstanding points of difficulty involve important issues of policy on which guidance is necessary before any further discussions with the americans. The Secretary of State for the Dominions shares this view. Withthis I entirely agree indeed, I feel that it would be most dangerous to delay any longer facing up to the political issues involved, and it is most regrettable in myopinion that no adequate time has been devoted (so far as I am aware) to the examination of alternative policies.5. One of the great defects of the discussions that have occupied the lasttwo years seems to me to consist, in ignoring what. I regard as our most importantadvantage and instrument for maintaining and. expanding our export trade,namely the fact that after the war we shall remain the largest importing countryboth of food and raw materials. It seems to me, therefore, that it is high time that we started exploring the possibility of coming to agreements with theDominions, India and other groups of countries for an immediate post-war startin expanding our mutual trade.6. I understand that many of the countries in western and north-western europe would be only too glad, to enter into arrangements of this sort. I amgiven to understand they express surprise that we have not already approached[27268] .11
Ilthem with proposals to this end. I should expect that the Dominions, with thepossible exception of Canada, would also welcome an alternative of this kind.There is no reason to suppose that South America would not do likewise.7. As regards agriculture, I have in a separate paper to-day (W.P. (44) 200)set forth briefly what in my view are the minimum requirements of a satisfactorypolicy.   They are incompatible with the Washington proposals.8. The President of the Board of Trade states in paragraph 3 of his Paper(W.P. (44) 199) that &quot;The proposals are designed to leave room.for adequate protection of our industries and agriculture by various means.&quot; They may havebeen designed to do so.   They certainly fail.9. We are faced therefore with the following dilemma. If we are tocontinue to discuss with the United. States the Washington proposals as they standwith the idea that they will eventually be adopted then we must declare to thepeople of this country that the Pledge which we gave on behalf of the three parties in November 1940, namely &quot; The Government, representative as it is of all major political parties,recognises the importance of maintaining after the war a healthy and well-balanced agriculture as an essential and permanent feature of national policy.&quot;can no longer be carried out.10. If on the other hand we wish to carry out that Pledge and work out thenecessary measures to that end, we cannot continue discussions with the UnitedStates on the basis of the existing Washington proposals. We must modify themfundamentally.11. We cannot continue to assure the agricultural industry that we intend to work out a pjolicy to fulfil the pledge while at the same time we commit our-selves to a general economic and commercial policy which prevents a fulfilment ofthe Pledge.   We cannot continue to pursue two incompatible objectives.12. Alternatively, the Washington proposals cannot come into operation &apos;for a number of years after the end of hostilities, i.e., after the Transition Period.Inevitably, they involve a reversal of policy which must provoke violent controversyand cleavage in this country. I would urge that this whole question is preciselyone which ought to be governed by the principles laid down by the War Cabineton the 21st October last on the basis of the Prime Minister&apos;s memorandum(W.P. (43) 467), headed War Transition. Peace: namely, that attention shouldbe concentrated on the plans for the Transition Period and should not be confusedand overlaid by discussions about long-term schemes except those on which thereis found to be a wide measure of general agreement.R. S. H.Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, S.W. 1,13*A April, 1944.
