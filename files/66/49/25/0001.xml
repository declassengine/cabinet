THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 225.Vbth April, 1944.WAR CABINET.- -EIGHTH REPORT OF THE SHIPPING COMMITTEE.IN our Seventh Report (W.P. (44) 37) we said that, while combined shipping-plans made at &quot;Sextant&quot; had been based on an import into this country of12  million tons in the first half of 1944, the severe strain which was likely to be imposed on United Kingdom ports and inland transport during that period might make it necessary to adjust the rate of import to a figure well below 12 million tons.2. In the first quarter of 1944 total non-tanker imports have amountedto 6-16 million tons, of which 2-50 million tons consists of food, 3-12 million tons of materials and - 54 million tons of munitions, &amp;c. Against imports duringthe second quarter sufficient ships, including the necessary American assistance,have been made available for loading- to cover a total import of 12 million tons for the half-year. Of this total, present estimates suggest that some 5-1 million tons will consist of food, 5-5 million tons of materials and 1-4 million tons ofmunitions, &amp;c.3. Though the rate of import during the first quarter of the year hasslightly exceeded an average of 2 million tons a month, it is by no means certainthat we can continue to handle through the ports and to distribute internally,throughout the second quarter, imports at this rate. Since the Seventh Report was written a number of steps, including a 10 per cent, reduction in steel production,have been taken to reduce the strain on internal transport, and every effort willbe made to enable imports to be received at the planned rate, but, nevertheless,there is at present an unbridged gap between our means of internal distribution and the prospective demands upon them.4. While imports have been greater than at one time seemed probable, theyhave been consumed at a substantially higher rate than was estimated in ourSeventh Report (Appendix B). The net consumption of food now expected forthe first half of 1944 amounts to some 6 - 0 million tons, as against the 5 - 56 million tons which was estimated in our Seventh Report. This is mainly due to increased consumption of wheat, oil-cake and sugar. In the case of sugar therehas also been a decrease in home production. Net consumption of materialslikewise is now expected to amount to some 7-0 million tons as against the-48 million tons estimated in the Seventh Report. This is mainly due to theincreased consumption of stocks of iron and steel necessitated by the curtailment of home production of pig-iron and steel.5. Partly as a result of these enhanced levels of net consumption, stocksof food are expected to decline by some - 9 million tons and stocks of materialsby about 1-5 million tons in the first six months of this year. By mid-1944stocks of food will have fallen to some 6-7 million tons and stocks of materials to some 12-5 million tons. The decline in food stocks is. most marked in thecase of sugar (450,000 tons), partly because of short-shipment from the Caribbeanarea and partly because of the use of sugar for the manufacture of industrialalcohol in this country. Food stocks at mid-1944 will still be at a higher level than at the same time in any previous war year, but it should be noted that theMinistry of Food is committed to supply up to about 750,000 tons of food-stuffsto S.C.A.E.F. to meet the requirements of the civilian population during thefirst 90 days of their military operations. Stocks of materials, on the other hand,will be reduced to approximately the same level as existed at end June 1943[27325]
6. It is not possible in the present report to give any more preciseindications regarding prospective imports and import requirements for thesecond half-of 1944 than were given in our Seventh Report. We suggest,however, that the import programme for 1944, which at present stands at26 million tons (less 370,000 tons imported in 1943 in excess of the programmethat year, which is credited to 1944), should now be set at 25 million tons.. Itis also desirable, as a general guide to planning, to fix upon some tentativedepartmental allocation of this total import. We recommend that imports ofmunitions should, as before, enjoy first priority. It is not yet certain how much the import of munitions will amount to in 1944, but, assuming that the figure is 1\ million tons, the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Production haveagreed to divide the remainder so that 10-85 million tons are allotted to food imports and 11-65 million tons are allotted to imports of materials.Signed on behalf of the Committee :HARCOURT JOHNS TONE,Chairman.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,25th April, 1944.
