May 1944,The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited, it is issued for the persona! use of ...rr?r??r?h^&apos;TOP SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 249.9th May, 1944.WAR CABINET.RESTRICTIONS ON PASSENGER TRAVEL.Note by the Lord President of the Council.1. At their meeting on the 8th May (L.P. (44) 24th Meeting) the lord presidents Committee considered various proposals for reducing passengertravel with a view to easing the strain on inland transport this summer. TheCommittee agreed that concession travel by wives and dependants of service personnel should be rationed, that severe cuts should be made in main line servicesand that the Minister of War Transport should make a statement designed to discourage the public from travelling.2. It was suggested at the meeting that some steps might be taken by theGovernment to discourage the holding of conferences involving travel by consider-able numbers of persons. Examples of the kind of conference which theCommittee had in mind are the Labour Party Conference in London atWhitsuntide, the Co-operative Party Conference in Blackpool at Whitsuntide,the Conference of the National Association of Local Government Officers inLondon on the 26th May, and the Conference of the National Housing and town planning Council in London on the 30th June.3. No special travel facilities are provided for conferences and, viewed inrelation to the total demands on passenger services, the saving which would result if all the conferences planned for this summer were cancelled would be relatively small. How far their cancellation would indirectly help the Government to discourage travel in general is difficult to assess.4. The conferences in question could not be prohibited by the exercise of theexisting powers in the Defence Regulations, which apply only to meetings likelyto cause serious public disorder or promote disaffection. Any action would,therefore, have to be by way of an appeal from the Government, which wouldhave to be public and in general terms, since it would be difficult, if not impossible, to send separate communications to the promoters of all conferences.No doubt most promoters would respond to such an appeal, but there might beexceptions.5. The question whether at this stage a public appeal of the kind indicatedwould compromise the security of &quot; Overlord &quot; has been examined. Clearly, anyappeal would have to be for the cancellation of all conferences from now onwardsto the late autumn, and it might be argued that a request in these terms wouldgive no clues to the enemy. On the other hand, it has been strongly represented to me that the significance which the enemy would attach to a request even inthese general terms would tend to defeat the measures which are being taken toprevent him from discovering the date of the operations which are being planned.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,9th May, 1944.9 ^5 9[27440]
