THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.SECBET.   &quot; / Copy No,W.P. (44) 211.ISth April, 1944.WAR CABINET.REGIONAL BODIES IN COLONIAL AREAS.(Meeting with Dominion Prime Ministers.)Memorandum by Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.ONE of the subjects which will come up for discussion at the forthcoming meeting with Dominion Prime Ministers is the establishment of internationalregional bodies in colonial areas, with special reference to Africa and the Pacific.I circulate, for the consideration of the War Cabinet, a paper prepared by theSecretary of State for the Colonies, after discussion with the committee, whichwas appointed under my chairmanship by the War Cabinet, and charged withpreparing material for the meeting with the Dominion Prime Ministers(W.M. (44) 9th Conclusions, Minute 4).The Colonial Secretary&apos;s paper incorporates certain conclusions reached in discussion with my Committee, but there are points, for example, the divisionof Africa into regional areas, upon which no conclusion was reached, and whichwill call for further discussion when the War Cabinet consider the naper.C.Dominions Office, 18fA April, 1944.INTERNATIONAL REGIONAL BODIES IN COLONIAL AREAS.1. The question of international regional bodies in Colonial areas wasconsidered on broad lines by the War Cabinet last year in connection with theproposed Joint Declaration with the United States, and a formula was agreed on for inclusion in that draft. Subsequently, with the authority of the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary, I made a statement in the House of Commonsbased upon the decision of the War Cabinet. Referring to common problems which transcend the boundaries of political units and can therefore only be solvedin co-operation, I said : &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome the establishment ofmachinery which will enable such problems to be discussed and to be solved by common efforts. What they have in mind is the possibility of establishingCommissions for certain regions. These Commissions would comprise notonly the States with Colonial territories in the region, but also other states which have in the region a major strategic or economic interest. Whileeach State would remain responsible for the administration of its ownterritory, such a Commission would provide effective and permanent machinery for consultation and collaboration so that the States concerned might work together to promote the well-being of the Colonial territories.An important consideration in designing the machinery of each commission will be to give to the people of the Colonial territories in the region anopportunity to be associated with its work.&quot;In this way it would be possible to have international co-operation which consisted of something more than theoretical discussion but would beable to grapple with realities, and get down to the solution of individualproblems.&quot;&quot;    [27300] b
2. Before the passage in the draft Declaration was agreed upon by the WarCabinet, it had been fully discussed with the Dominions. It is fair to say thatall the Dominions were in general agreement with it, though some of them made certain points on it.   These are summarised in the Appendix to this paper.3. During the talks with the Dominion Prime Ministers it will be necessaryto fill in something at any rate of the very general outline of our policy given inmy statement in Parliament, though I should deprecate any detailed discussionof the machinery to be set up. Conditions vary so greatly between the possibleregions that no one detailed plan could be effective in all. The following, however,are some of the major matters which I think may be raised and upon which it willbe necessary for us to announce our view.(A) International Colonial Commission.4. In view of the interest shown by Canada and Australia in the idea of third-party interest this question is most likely to be raised. It is likely also tohave considerable support in the United States.*5. In general, I am opposed to an International Colonial Commission withsupervisory powers. In view of the vast areas and immensely differing problems which it would have to consider, it could not fail to be academic, unpractical andirresponsible in its outlook.6. I also feel very strongly that it would be fatal to the regional commissions to link them up in any way with such a body, for they must be practical bodies and will only succeed if they can achieve practical results. TheUnited States will be represented on most of them and she will be a quite sufficientmouthpiece for the world conscience and third-party interests.7. On the other hand, it may be necessary to pay the price of having someinternational body in order to secure certain other advantages. I hope thatin the general settlement at the end of the war it will be found possible to doaway with the Mandatory system in the British Colonial Empire and with the congo Basin Treaties. I am not objecting to the actions of the mandates commission; although from its nature it could never assist in a constructivemanner, it was often of value in a negative plane. But the differentiation withinBritish&apos;Colonial territories between the ordinary Colony and the Mandated areasgave to the latter an aspect of impermanence which in the Cameroons, Togolandand Tanganyika reacted greatly to their disadvantage. In the case of the CongoBasin Treaties, while these have had both advantages and disadvantages in thepast, they will certainly be in many respects out-of-date after the war. But they represent a long tradition of international action in tropical Africa, and it maywell not be possible to get rid of the out-of-date provisions without some newinstrument continuing and bringing up to date the provisions which remain of value. For both these reasons there may have to be in the new world set-up somecentral international body dealing with Colonial affairs.8. I should not object to an International Colonial Bureau attached tothe proposed World Organisation, if its functions were limited to receivingreports from all Colonial Governments and collating information about colonial affairs. No doubt it would also publish some kind of bulletin, but it would haveno direct supervisory powers.9. I suggest that we should make the idea of international regionalassociations our main contribution to the solution of Colonial questions, but thatif need be we should be prepared to agree to an International Colonial Bureauwith these limited functions as the price of getting rid of the Mandate system and the obnoxious features of the Congo Basin Treaties.(B) Executive Control versus Co-operation.10. It may be that there will be some attempt to introduce into what under our lay-out is a purely consultative body some measure of executive control. Itis a change which has always been urged by Mr. Taussig in connection with theAnglo-American Caribbean Commission. I feel that we must resist strongly anysuch attempt. It may be that there is room for special executive bodies to carryout specific delegated functions throughout a region, such as the anti-locust unit* Note. The question is being raised by Dr. Bowman, a member of Mr. Stettinius&apos; party.A separate report will be made to the War Cabinet on this.
in Africa and the Middle East. I see no objection, but on the contrary advantage,if the constituent Governments so desire, to the creation of special bodies suchas this to carry out functions which cannot in the nature of things be adequatelycarried out by one Government alone. But I am sure that, with this exception, itwould be a great mistake to give executive functions to the Regional Commissionsthemselves; firstly, on the ground that, as a vast majority of their members wouldhave no responsibility for carrying out a decision in a particular territory, itcould only lead to administrative confusion; and, secondly, on the ground that inthe more advanced of the British colonial areas it would be deeply resented bythe local inhabitants and would become more and more impracticable as further)      measures of self-government were granted.(C) Association of Local Inhabitants with the Work of the Commissions.11. In principle I agree entirely with the desire to associate the inhabitants of the regions to the maximum extent with the work of these Commissions, butin practice, and in particular in the early stages, it will be a matter of greatdifficulty. The history and manner of development of individual British Colonieshave created an intense local patriotism in tlhem, and they have so far little in theway of regional feeling. Better communications and better co-operation betweenthem will diminish local suspicion and increase the regional feeling, but as things are now these are matters which we have to take into account. For instance, Ihave constantly been urged to appoint a West Indian as one of the permanent members of the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission, and I should certainly have been willing to do so, but it has proved quite impossible to find any one whowould be regarded as a representative of the West Indies as a whole and notmerely of the Colony from which he came.12. I suggest that we should give every encouragement to the principle ofproviding within the machinery of the Commissions opportunities for partieipa-tion by the people of the region, but that we should not accept any proposal whichplaces an obligation on us for some particular form of association.(D) Defence.13. During our discussions leading up to the draft Joint Declaration wehad in mind that defence should be one of the subjects dealt with by the regional commissions. On further consideration, I do not think this view was correct.In the first place, the people who would be suitable representatives on a Commis-sion dealing with other subjects would be quite unfitted to be representatives for defence matters. In the second place, it is by no means clear that suitable areas for regional conferences if drawn on the basis of common racial, commercial or social problems would be co-terminous with the areas of regional councils ifdrawn on the basis of defence requirements. There is an interesting example ofthis in the recent Australia-New Zealand Agreement. This proposes a SouthSeas Regional Council for a region which is apparently quite different from the&quot;regional defence zone&quot; also mentioned in the Agreement. Thirdly, while i hope we shall all agree that the Regional Commissions should be purely consul-tative and should have no executive control, this would not be sufficient for regional organisations dealing with defence. It would be essential to give bodies of that nature some power of implementing their decisions. For all these reasons recommend, that defence be excluded from the purview of the regional commissions.(E) Permanent Machinery.14. I am convinced that whatever the ultimate form of a particular RegionalCommission or whether it starts as a full-blown Commission or by a gradualapproach through ad hoc conferences, it will be useful in all cases to set up somepermanent secretarial machinery.15. It will also be most important to ensure that international functionalbodies, such as the I.L.O., the Health Organisation, and the Permanent Organisa-tion for Food and Agriculture, establish regional branches to work in association with the permanent machinery of the Commissions.16.   These branches would, no doubt, themselves do good work in the regions.In addition, the closer association of international functional bodies withColonial areas would serve a political purpose in that their conferences wouldprovide a most useful and practical means of bringing international discussion[27300] &quot; B 2
and interest into Colonial affairs. While, as I have said, I am opposed to a specific International Colonial Commission, I should see positive advantage in discussions by specialists on these functional bodies on problems of Coloniallabour, health, agriculture and so forth. There have been discussions of this nature in the past, such as the I.L.O. discussions leading to the Forced LabourConvention, which have served a very useful purpose.(F) Possible Regions.17. I will now deal individually with each of the possible regions in whichcommissions could be set up.(i) Caribbean.18. In some ways this may prove the easiest region and the one in which itwill first be found possible to establish a completely developed Commission. Agood deal of the groundwork has already been done by the Anglo-AmericanCaribbean Commission, and, although it is true that so far it is a purely Anglo-American body, it is already beginning to broaden. For instance, at the recentWest Indian Conference, Canada, the Netherlands and France were all repre-sented by observers. When fully developed the natural members of theCommission would be the United States, ourselves, the Netherlands and france as parent nations of Colonies in the area, the independent islands of Cuba, Haitiand San Domingo, some of the independent Governments of South America suchas Venezuela, and Canada as a country outside the region but having consider-,able economic interests in it. However, the immediate addition of the independentCaribbean and South American States would complicate the working of theCommission to such an extent as to render it probably quite ineffective. I donot think that there is any action which the Conference of Prime ministers should take in regard to this(ii) Africa.19. Owing to the views of the Union this area may well present us withthe greatest difficulty. It is clear that Field-Marshal Smuts will wish to discussthe future of the Continent. It seems that he has in mind a region which will include the whole of Africa with the exception of the territories bordering onthe Mediterranean.20. I am wholly opposed to this view, firstly, on the ground that such an enormous area, including territories whose problems have little in common,would be found quite unpractical and the deliberations of a Commission cover-ing the whole of it would end by being largely theoretical. The second ground for objection is that it would extend the influence of South Africa into areas where that country is regarded with the deepest suspicion and dislike. Theinhabitants of West Africa would resent very deeply an association which wouldappear to bring them under the predominant influence of the Union.21. There would, however, be advantages in a Regional Commissioncovering Southern and Central Africa. The area would include northern rhodesia, Nyasaland, Portuguese East and West Africa and the Belgian Congo.Southern Rhodesia would either be a part of the region or an &quot;outside Power.&quot;South Africa would also be an outside Power. I think the inclusion of northern rhodesia and Nyasaland is inevitable. It may be argued, that this wouldspread Union influence into them. This is certainly a danger, but on the onehand their natural economic links are with the area, and on the other hand theinclusion of Portuguese East and West Africa and the Belgian Congo wouldlessen the danger of Union domination on the Commission. I suggest therefore that we should favour a Regional Commission for this area but that it should occupy itself chiefly with technical conferences dealing as far as possible with non-political subjects.22. For West Africa we ought to insist upon separate treatment. While Iam not sure that there is a case for the immediate setting up of a RegionalCommission for that area (there is reason to suppose that the French would opposeit), ultimately one will have to be set up; but it should be a separate body fromthat covering Southern and Central Africa. A West African commission would include the four British Colonies, French West and Equatorial Africa, theSpanish and Portuguese possessions and Liberia. The probability is that theUnited States would have to be included as a country having a major interest in
the region, and possibly also South Africa as having an economic interest, but,even if it were included, the Commission would still be based in West Africa, andI think thus many of the fears of the inhabitants would be allayed.23. In East Africa there is little practical use for a Regional Commission;as the four British Colonies have little relationship with any of the foreignColonial possessions, except, for certain purposes not of major importance, withthe Belgian Mandated area of Ruanda-Urundi. To include, however, this area in the southern Regional Commission dominated by the Union would undoubtedlyincrease the Union&apos;s political and economic penetration and from our point ofview is most undesirable. I suggest, therefore, that we take the line that at themoment there would not appear to be any practical need for a Commission in east Africa, but that they might be entitled to send observers to the commission for Southern and Central Africa. I realise, however, that it may be felt that weshould aim at getting all Colonial territories covered by Regional Commissions,even if the practical advantages are much less in some cases than in others.(iii) South-East Asia.24. It is quite clear that it would be wholly impracticable to discuss in anydetail the formation of a regional organisation in this area/which is at present occupied entirely by the enemy. It may, however, be well for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to indicate that they do not regard this area as one suitable eventuallyfor the establishment of a Regional Commission. Obviously there would beincluded within the boundaries of such a region Malaya, the Netherlands east indies, the British territories in Borneo, Portuguese Timor, Siam, Indo-Chinaand the Philippines. This area before the war had much greater wealth (rubber,tin, &amp;c.) than the other areas discussed, and a much greater population (of theorder of 120 millions). We need not, I think, now discuss whether the regionwould have to be further extended to include Burma, Ceylon, Hong Kong, &amp;c.The United States, Australia, China, India,*and even possibly Russia are outsidePowers with major strategic or economic interests in it.(iv) South-West Pacific.25. This is an area in which the establishment of a Regional Commission,possibly at once, should not present insuperable difficulties, and I suggest that weshould accept in principle proposals for it on the lines of the Australia-New Zealand Agreement. The region would include Fiji and other UnitedKingdom islands; New Caledonia and other French islands; the New Hebrides;various United States islands; the Mandated Territories and dependencies ofAustralia and New Zealand; and the islands at present mandated to the Japanese.I have worked out a fairly detailed scheme for the region, but it would probablybe wise to let Australia and New Zealand take the initiative.O. S.Colonial Office, l$ih April, 1944.
APPENDIX.The following is a brief summary of the points made by. the DominionGovernments in commenting on the proposal for Regional Commissions as set outin the draft of the Joint Declaration : (i) Field-Marshal Smuts, while welcoming the idea of internationalCommissions, tied up with it his ideas on the organisation of theBritish Colonies. He would like to see the multiplicity of small british Colonies make way for larger units, each with its owndevelopment council on which the Dominions more or less closelyinterested in the region would sit. Thus Canada would be on the west indian unit, South Africa on the South and East African unit, whileAustralia and New Zealand would be on the Far Eastern units,(ii) Canada and Australia both thought that the declaration should acceptthe principle of &quot;accountability.&quot; The Canadians thought that thisrequired the introduction into the Regional Commissions of genuinelythird-party opinion, i.e., representatives of countries without greatinterests in the region. The Australians thought that there should be some International Colonial Commission which might perhaps operatethrough the Regional Commissions. The Regional Commissionsshould be able to maintain their own technical staffs and should havethe power of inspection,(iii) The Canadians and Australians also both thought that provision shouldbe made for representation on the Commissions of the peoples of the regions themselves. * .
