Britain since 1929,. the year ofTrotsky&apos;s expulsion from the U.S.S.R. The movement originally consisted of several small groups, from which there emerged in. 1937&apos; the RevolutionarySocialist League (the official British Section of the Fourth International) and theWorkers&apos; International League. The Revolutionary Socialist League wasstultified by internal strife and the: Workers&apos; International League outdistancedit in members and activity. The two parties have for some time been urged bythe International Secretariat to unite, and on the 12th March, -1944, they at length did so. The new body has (to the annoyance of the Communist Party ofGreat Britain) taken the name &apos;&apos; Revolutionary Communist Party &quot; and has succeeded the Revolutionary Socialist League as the British Section of the Fourth[27269] &apos; B:
International. It is too early to say &quot;what the relations of the party with theInternational will be, but the International is loosely organised and is not likelyto have the will or the means to do more than advise the party on broad issues;nor is the party under its present leadership likely to submit to any attempt atdictation.The leadership remains in the hands of the former leaders of the Workers&apos;International League, James Haston, Mrs. Mildred Lee, Edward Grant, RoyTearse and Harold Atkinson (see Appendix A). This group is in effective control of the organisation, which is strongly centralised. District Committeesexist in London, Scotland, Tyneside, Merseyside, Yorkshire and the Midlands,but do not act without close consultation with Headquarters. No figures of thetotal membership are available, but in London, where the movement is strongest,there are 152 members, of whom thirty-two are in the forces. Outside london the party has about twenty branches. A branch rarely has more than twentymembers and sometimes has less than ten, and the total number of members inthe forces is unlikely to be more than a hundred. On this basis the total membership is probably well below a thousands Membership, however, is confined to those who have served six months&apos; probation and proved themselvesactive workers, and sympathisers are probably more numerous than official members. Even allowing for people who are prepared to work for the movement from outside, the number of active Trotskyists in the country is very small. Theparty is strongest, outside London, on Clydeside, and weakest in the midlands and South Wales.  It hardly exists outside the larger industrial areas.The Trotskyists, like the Stalinists, attempt to increase their influence bypenetrating other organisations. Attempts to penetrate Trade Unions have met with little success, but some progress has been made in the I.L.P., which theTrotskyists regard as the party commanding the largest following of militantworkers. This progress is most marked on Tyneside, where the divisional repre-sentative on the I.L.P. National Committee is also a member of the central committee of the Revolutionary Communist Party.In the Autumn of 1943 the Militant Workers&apos; Federation was formed toco-ordinate the activity of militant groups which had arisen spontaneously amongdissident Communists and members of the I.L.P. and the W.I.L. The Federationis directed by the Revolutionary Communist Party; its secretary is Roy Tearse,who claims that it now has nine regional Committees. The most important ofthese are the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee and the London Militant Workers&apos;Committee. There is a committee at Sheffield and possibly also at Huddersfield,Barrow and Rugby; and there are small groups of sympathisers on Tyneside,Merseyside and in Nottingham, which Tearse may count as committees. TheFederation is not much more than a paper organisation, but it is useful to theTrotskyists as a source of contacts and as an instrument of their industrial policy, particularly among engineering workers.The Revolutionary Communist Party has three papers, Socialist Appeal, afortnightly publication of which 8,000 to 10,000 copies are printed, Workers&apos;International News, a theoretical organ of which 2,000 copies are printed atirregular intervals, and The Militant Miner, a small local sheet which has beentaken over from an independent group in Lanarkshire on its fusion with theWorkers&apos; International League. The Ministry of Supply refused last october to continue to supply the Workers&apos; International League withnewsprint pending the production of satisfactory evidence of their pre-war consumption. This has not been forthcoming, and the party has been forced toreduce both the size and the circulation of Socialist Appeal.Finance.There are no indications that Trotskyist organisations receive money fromabroad. The members are expected to contribute liberally and are apparentlyprepared to do so. Haston is reported in the Daily Telegraph of the10th April, 1944, as saying : 1&apos; Most of our members pay 5s. a week when, theycan, and those who can afford it pay a 25 per cent, levy on their wages.&quot;The Movements income for 1943 was  2,654. Sales of Socialist Appealbrought in  781, and it is believed that Mildred Lee contributed most of herprivate income of  350. There were a few substantial subscriptions, includingsums of  30- 50, believed to have come from a Cumberland mill-owner, but thegreater part of the total was received from branches and anonymous individuals in amounts varying from a few shillings to  5.* The newspapers report that Haston said the membership was 1,500, and that on the same day Mildred Lee said it was 2,000.
38Policy and Methods.While the British Trotskyists follow the line of the sect in regarding thewar as a struggle between rival Imperialisms, their policy is not directly aimedeither at stopping the war or at procuring the defeat of their country. they point out that the suffering the war brings is the fruit of the greed and crueltyof the capitalist&apos;&apos; boss &apos;&apos;; but they do not agitate for peace, and their programme(see Appendix B) includes a pledge of full support for the Soviet Union. Theirpropaganda appears to be intended rather to stir up class feeling among theworkers than to have any direct effect on the war.The main object of Trotskyist policy is to stimulate and focus discontent. and to obtain the leadership of the group of militants thus formed. - The partyseeks not only to take the place vacated by the Communist Party as the leader ofthe normally discontented elements, but to attract to itself the larger body ofworkers who, while not yet ready to take up a militantly anti-government attitude, are suspicious of their employers, doubtful of the sincerity of theGovernments promises of post-war reform, and tiring of the industrial truceand the leaders who seek to enforce it. The&apos; party&apos;s appeal to these groups is somewhat similar to that of the Communist Party before June 1941. There arethe same bitter attacks on the callous, profiteering &quot;boss,&quot; on &quot;anti-working-class legislation,&quot; on the sacrifices demanded of the workers, and on the&quot; imperialist war.&quot; On the latter subject the Trotskyists are, however, lesspersistent and less defeatist than were the Communists.To carry out this policy they campaign on issues and in areas where there isalready strong feeling among the workers, Although the party is always readyto exploit grieAnances in any factory or mine where it has contacts, it is too smalland scattered to be able to start trouble on any considerable scale by itself, andit can make more progress by clinging to the fringes of a big strike than byleading a small one. It secures a wider field for its propaganda, a field alreadywell prepared by the mere existence of a grievance strong enough to cause astrike; and in the bitter aftermath of a big dispute it may hope to start a newbranch of the party or a committee of the Militant Workers&apos; Federation. Theparty&apos;s technique is accordingly to fasten on an area where a strike is threateningor has broken out; one of the leaders, or the local group if there is one, makescontacts among the strikers and sells literature; the cause and course of thestrike is reported in Socialist Appeal; and, whatever the outcome, the moraldrawn is that only by militant activity under new leadership can the workerssecure their rights.  But the effect is small.Socialist Appeal devotes a good deal of its space, though by no means all,to discussing strikes and industrial grievances. It attempts to discredit theGovernment, the employers and the trade-union leaders; but, while it undoubtedlyfans discontent and encourages strikers, it seldom explicitly incites to strike andit makes no attempt to foment sympathetic strikes. The party&apos;s slogan is not&quot; Strike ! &quot; but &quot; Break the coalition.: Labour to power.&quot; It desires the establish-ment of a Labour Government because it believes that any post-war government must fail to fulfil the workers&apos; expectations, and that the failure of a labour government will produce a disillusion strong enough to throw the working classinto the arms of the extremists.Influence on Industry.The influence of the Trotskyists in industry is still slight. In connectionwith the recent strike of engineering apprentices, there is evidence thatRoy Tearse and Heaton Lee, the party&apos;s organiser on Tyneside, advised and directed the boys&apos; leaders and that on the Clyde the apprentices were working in conjunction with the Clyde Workers&apos; Committee. At Barrow in -September1943 Trotskyists had some part in directing the strike committee during theearly days of the strike, but the cause of the strike was a strongly felt industrialgrievance and not Trotskyist agitation. Trotskyists also took some part in the strikes at the Rolls Royce aircraft works, Glasgow, in August 1941 and July1943, in a strike at the Barnbow Royal Ordnance Factory in June 1943 and inthe Yorkshire Transport strike in May 1943, but their activity has consistedin advising and encouraging the strike leaders rather than in provoking the strikes. - .,Trotskyist influence in mining is considerably less than in engineering.  Thereis no evidence that Trotskyists have ever started mining strikes or exercised any appreciable influence on their course.   They are drawn to the coalfields by a[27269] &apos; b 2
desire to make converts and they are rarely in touch with strike leaders. In SouthWales the Workers&apos; International League had at the time of this recent striketwo contacts, each of a fortnights standing, and no organisation. The inter-vention of the leaders was confined to two visits by Haston, one on the 10th March,four days after the strike had begun, the other on the 18th March, two days after the majority of men, including those in the area Haston visited, had returnedto work. The mid-March issue of Socialist Appeal, the smallest that has yetappeared, was devoted entirely to the strike but was not out until it was almostover.In Yorkshire the Trotskyists have only two groups, at Leeds and Sheffield.Each has about twenty members, most of whom have no connection with mining.During the recent strike small-scale propaganda has been carried on in her sparetime by a local leader (Betty Hamilton) with a handful of assistants. five hundred copies of Socialist Appeal have been sent to the area, and pamphletshave been distributed. I\o national leader has covered the strike, but EdwardGrant, editor of Socialist Appeal, who is suffering from a break-down, interrupteda rest cure to address one meeting and do some canvassing. It was attended: byfifty people, few of whom showed any enthusiasm. Victory Gavzey aged 19 theonly other person of Trotskyist sympathies who is known to have addressedmeetings, moved a resolution at one of them that the men should return to workand then ask for an increase in pay. The Trotskyists were certainly not responsible for starting the strike, and there is no evidence that they have been responsible for prolonging it. Considering their limited strength in the area and the small scale of their activity, their influence on the situation must havebeen very small.The only Trotskyist mining group of any significance is that organised inLanarkshire by Hugh Brannan, secretary of the national miners&apos; group of theI.L.P. and a Trade Unionist of standing. The group is, however, very smalland its influence is limited.The Trotskyists are attracting workers whose discontent and desire to hitout at the employer and the Government can find no other outlet. They have achieved a small and localised but recognisable influence; and: they are confident that the appeal of their militant programme will become stronger as the strainand friction inseparable from prolonged industrial effort increases. They havea closely knit core of energetic leaders and a membership which makes up inenthusiasm what it lacks in numbers. They are helped by the. absence of competition, except from the I.L.P., which they hope to use as a conscious orunconscious ally, the lack of normal political and trade-union activity, and the sense of frustration which is alleged to be produced by the absence of markedprogress towards either victory in the field or reconstruction at home. these advantages are temporary and, unless the Trotskyists can exploit them muchmore rapidly than at present, it seems unlikely that they will ever rise to agreater position than that of sparring partners to the Communists, who would very much like to see the Trotskyists and their small paper suppressed.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall,13th April, 1944.
APPENDIX A.Officials of the Revolutionary Communist Party.James Ritchie Haston, National organiser, aged 32, describes himselfvariously as an aero engineer, a builder and a journalist. He has been an activeTrotskyist since 1936, and from August 1941 until the amalgamation was employed as National organiser of the Workers&apos; International League. He isin grade 4. Several attempts by the Ministry of Labour to place him in other employment have failed.Mildred Lee, Secretary, aged 31, is a South African and a milliner&apos;s buyerby trade. She came here in 1938 with her husband, the founder of the Workers&apos;International League, and she remained as the League&apos;s Secretary when her husband returned to South Africa. She devotes most of an income of about 350 a year received from South Africa to the cause., Edward Grant, Editor of Socialist Appeal, aged 30, is also South african and has been connected with the Workers&apos; International League since itsinception. He was posted to the Pioneer Corps but fractured his skull beforejoining up and was discharged. It has proved impossible, owing to the effects of his injury, to find him alternative employment.Roy Tearse, Industrial organiser, is 25. He served for four years in theRoyal Navy and was discharged in 1937 on medical grounds. He suffers from theeffects of infantile paralysis. From 1941 to 1943 he was employed as an aeroengine tester at De Havillands, Edgware, but was again discharged on medical grounds and has been certified by the medical referee unfit for regular employment.He was for two years a secret member of the Workers&apos; International Leagueunder an assumed name while acting openly as an energetic member of the I.L.P.but has lately resigned from the latter and. avowed his Trotskyist allegiance.He is secretary of the Militant Workers&apos; Federation.Harold Atkinson, Chairman and Treasurer, aged 31, has been associatedwith Trotskyism since 1938. He is employed as a draughtsman by Messrs.Griffin &amp; Tatlock. He devotes most of his spare time to the business side of theorganisation but does not often appear in public.Heaton Lee and Ann Keen, who have been associated with Tearse in theTyneside apprentice strike, are trusted and experienced Trotskyists; both are believed, to be members of the Central Committee. Lee was born in South africa on the 19th January, 1916, and came to England in 1937 already a convinced.Trotskyist. He is a civil engineer by profession and since 1938 has been employedby Messrs. Wimpey on works in London, Glasgow and Tyneside. He is reportedto have met Mrs. Keen in the course of his voyage to England. She becameconverted to Trotskyism and has lived with Lee and collaborated in his Trotskyistactivities ever since. While they were in Glasgow Lee acted, as Workers&apos; Inter-national League district organiser and Keen as literature secretary; when theymoved to Newcastle they continued to work in these capacities. On account ofhis work Lee appears little in public, and confines himself to organisation, making and developing contacts, and lecturing on political subjects under the auspices of the National Council of Labour Colleges. Mrs. Keen regularly sellsSocialist Appeal and other literature in the streets. (Heaton Lee is not believed to be any relation of Mildred Lee&apos;s husband.)APPENDIX B.Programme of the Revolutionary Communist Party.An end to the coalition with the Bosses.
