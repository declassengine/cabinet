THIS DOCUMENT IS THJa. PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 229.27th April, 1944.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH 1944 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND MANDATED TERRI-TORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.CANADA has signed Mutual Aid Agreements with the United Kingdom,Russia and Australia (see also under &quot; Australia &quot;).2. There has been some excitement about the prospects of a GeneralElection as a result of a speech by the Minister for Revenue, in which he said thatit was generally known that a Federal Election would be held next year, &apos;&apos; if notat the end of this ye&amp;T.&quot;3. Mr. John Bracken, leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, hasbeen very active, making speeches at Quebec and. Ottawa, during which hedeclared that the Progressive Conservative Party was in reality a new party.Mr. Bracken&apos;s active campaigning and his failure to seek a seat in the House ofCommons led to a heated debate in the Senate, one member declaring the positionto be unconstitutional.4. The Minister of Pensions has submitted to the Social Security Committeeof the House of Commons a revised plan of Health Insurance which provides fora complete, partly contributory, health service.5. The creation of a National Joint Council for the public service along thelines of a Whitley Council has been announced by the Minister of Finance.6. The North-West Air Route from Edmonton to Alaska has become an all-Canadian project. In making this announcement to the House of Commons theMinister of Munitions said that the route was-one of the most important in theworld, both in relation to the war against Japan, and subsequently as part of aninternational air route. &quot;7. Although Colonel Drew, the Premier of Ontario, does not possess amajority in the Ontario Legislature, it is unlikely that the Government will be severely threatened by the coalition of the Commonwealth Co-operative Federa-tion and the Liberals, as the C.C.F. position is considered to have deteriorated.The Premier has declared that the Government retained the confidence of theProvince until the Opposition passed a vote of non-confidence, thus throwing theresponsibility for upsetting the present Government on the C.C.F.8. The strife within the Bloc Populaire Canadien has increased thepopularity of the Premier of Quebec, Mr. Godbout.9. There has been much gratification, particularly in the French Press, thatMajor Paul Triquet has been awarded the second V.C. given to a Canadian inthis war.10. Mr. W. F. A. Turgeon has been appointed first Canadian ambassador to Mexico, and Dr. Francisco Del Rio Canaro first Mexican Ambassador to canada. .v Copy No.WAR CABINET.[27332]b

Algonquin, havebeen commissioned.15. During March, 6th (R.C.A.F.) Bomber Group again showed a slight increase of activity over the previous month. The total number of sorties flownwas 1,513, but the losses for the. period were considerably reduced, being 32 ascompared with 61. Operations were for the most part changed from objectives in Germany to marshalling yards in France. Targets in Germany includedStuttgart (twice), Frankfurt (twice), Berlin and Essen; those in France wereLe Mans (twice), Amiens (twice), Laon, Aulnoye, Courtrai, Meulan-les-Mureauxand Trappes. Numerous mining operations were carried out. 429 Squadroncompleted converting from Halifax II&apos;s and has become fully operational onHalifax IIFs.16. Air Vice-Marshal C. M. McEwan, M.C., D.F.C., R.C.A.F., assumedcommand of 6th (R.C.A.F.) Bomber Group vice Air Vice-Marshal G. E. Brookes,C.B., O.B.E., R.C.A.F.17. In the 2nd Tactical Air Force activities were again limited owing tonumerous squadron moves and extensive training programmes. 873 sorties were flown; 6 aircraft were lost; 7 German aircraft were destroyed and 4 damaged.441, 442 and 443 Squadrons are now converting from Spitfire VB&apos;s toSpitfire IX&apos;s.18.

Domestic interest has mainly centred on the prolonged debates in theHouse of Representatives on the Constitutional Alteration (Post-War Recon-struction) Bill, providing for a referendum to the electors of the 14 powersrecommended at the Constitutional Convention with the States in 1942. Briefly,the Commonwealth Government desire the transfer of these powers, at presentexercised by the States, to the Commonwealth for a period of five years after theend of the war. As some of the State Parliaments refused to pass the relevantlegislation, it will be necessary, if the Commonwealth Government are to exercise -
these powers, to obtain the assent of the electors to the transfer, by meansof a referendum. (For previous notes, see Reports for November 1942, November 1943and January 1944.) The opinion is freely expressed by the Australian press thatthe referendum is doomed. The only newspaper to give whole-hearted support to the Commonwealth Government is the Sydney Morning Herald, which con-siders that critics of the Bill confused constitutional power with political action.The Bill eventually passed all stages of the House of Representatives.23.   In view of dissatisfaction over the Australian Censorship, especially the censorship of internal mails, a commission of enquiry was set up.   (the controversy on this matter culminated in the suppression by the CommonwealthH    Government during the present month of several leading Australian newspapers.)24. The Minister for Post-War Reconstruction, Mr. Chifley, has announcedthat the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme for ex-servicemen andwomen is to start on a limited scale. Training will be available for eligible and suitable discharged ex-service members, in professional and semi-professionalcourses, at technical colleges and universities, as the man-power situationallowed.25. A Bill providing for the introduction of a scheme of pay-as-you-gotaxation has passed through the final stages of the House of Representatives.26. The Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Evatt, has announced the signing of a Canadian-Australian Mutual Aid Agreement, under which Australiaexpects to receive from Canada goods and services valued at approximately A. 24,000,000.27. The award of the Victoria Cross to Sergeant Thomas Currie Derrick,D.C.M-, of the Australian Military Forces, makes the 14th V.C. awarded toAustralians in the present war.Service Activities.28. H.M.A.S. Strahan (Minesweeper) was commissioned and H.M.A.S.Lachlan (Frigate) was launched during the month.29. Lieutenant-General Sir John D. Lavarack has taken over the AustralianMilitary Mission, Washington, in succession to Lieutenant-General V. A. H.Sturdee, who has returned to Australia. Lieutenant-General Sir Lees Morsheadhas been appointed to command the 2nd Australian Army and temporarily theNew Guinea Force.30. Lieutenant-General V. A, H. Sturdee has been appointed to command the 1st Australian Army. Major-General S. G. Savige has been appointed to command the 1st Australian Corps and has been promoted temporary Lieutenant-General.31. Major-General F. H. Berryman has been appointed to 2nd AustralianCorps and promoted temporary Lieutenant-General.32. Thirteen Australian Officers, including two Lieutenants-Colonel, have left Australia for England to take up duty with the British Army in Staff andRegimental appointments.33. Total discharges from the army to rural industry from the 1st November,1943, to the 25th March, 1944, are 12,170.34. Total United States Force (Army and Air Corps) in the South-west pacific Area is 391,728, of which 86,469 belong to the Air Corps.NEW ZEALAND.35. The Prime Minister, commenting on the terms of the Canadian mutual aid Agreements with the United Kingdom, Australia and Russia, said that new Zealand had a Mutual Aid Agreement with Canada under consideration,,and that the Government was in accord with the emphasis placed by Dr. Evatt,the Australian Minister of External Affairs, on the importance in post-war yearsof maintaining a&apos; high level of employment throughout the world, and inparticular with Australia^ general policy in relation to international economiccollaboration.36.   New Zealand authorities have not taken seriously the criticisms in theUnited States newspapers of the Australia-New Zealand Agreement.   ThoseUnited States newspapers which have been most active in their criticism are those[27332] b 2
which have indulged for a long time in criticism of New Zealand&apos;s war effort asa whole.37. The main features of the debates in the House of Representatives havebeen the renewed advocacy by the Leader of the Opposition of the relief, by menin reserved occupations, of the veteran New Zealand soldiers who have beenfighting now for over four years. He also alleged that the country faced a crisison account of the decline of primary production. In this connexion muchpublicity has been given to an article by Mr. Bankes Amery about the urgency of the United Kingdom needs.38. Some New Zealand newspaper representatives who recently visitedLondon have found that the United Kingdom press enjoys greater freedom thanthe New Zealand press, and the publication of this opinion has led to a heateddebate in the House of Representatives.39. The Prime Minister has announced the appointment of a SelectCommittee to enquire into allegations regarding the operation of the PostalCensorship.40. Mr. C. A. Berendsen, at present New Zealand High Commissioner inAustralia, is to succeed Mr. Nash as New Zealand Minister at Washington;Mr. Charles W. Boswell becomes first New Zealand Minister to Soviet Russia;Mr. David Wilson is to be New Zealand High Commissioner in Canada; andMr. J. G. Barclay High Commissioner in Australia.41. The 80th and 81st Motor Launch Flotillas, totalling 12 fair miles,have been placed under the operational control of the United States Commander,South Pacific Area, for service in forward areas.42. On the 1st March- the strength of the Royal New Zealand Navy was9,521, comprising 1,623 officers and 7,898 ratings, including 1,005 officers and1,611 ratings lent to the Royal Navy.43. The 3rd New Zealand Division, less the 8th Brigade Group,- togetherwith United States Anti-Aircraft Coast Defence and Airfield ConstructionsUnits under its command, landed on Nissan Island on the 15th February.Opposition was negligible, there being only about 70 Japanese on the island. As a preliminary to the landing a raid on the island was carried out by the 30th NewZealand Battalion to cover various necessary technical reconnaissances; the raid was highly successful and only very minor casualties were sustained.44. The first half of the month passed quietly for the 2nd New Zealand division in Italy. On the morning of the 15th, at 8-30 a.m., an intense Allied air bombardment of Cassino was carried out, and at noon the New Zealand divisionstarted their attack on the town, which was held by the 1st German Parachutedivision. By 4 p.m. the New Zealanders were reported fighting their way throughthe streets. The air bombardment had, however, turned out to be a two-edgedweapon in that the streets of Cassino were blocked by debris to such an extent as toprevent the passage of tanks and armoured vehicles in support of the infantry.During the night the 15th/16th the attack on Cassino was supported further onthe right by an assault upon Monastery Hill by the 4th Indian Division. TheIndian troops started well and advanced to within 800 yards of the monastery, but were then obliged to await reinforcements. By the next day the New Zealandershad captured Castle Hill, which overlooks Cassino from the North-West. By the17th, with the aid of a few tanks, the railway station had been captured andmopping up was in progress of small pockets of Germans resisting desperately.45. Throughout the battle the German Parachute troops fought with thegreatest determination and gradually brought the situation under control and managed to reinforce certain of their strong points. On the 23rd an attack by our infantry, although supported by tanks, against a strongly-defended house inthe centre of the town, failed. By this time the forward troops of each side were so close to each other that it was difficult for our artillery to engage the enemywithout danger to our own men. This phase marked the limit of our advance; onthe night of the 24th/25th it was found necessary to withdraw the Indian troops on Hangman&apos;s Hill, who had become isolated, and also some New Zealandersfrom a detached position south-west of Cassino. At the end of ten days&apos; intensefighting the majority of the town remained in our hands, but the Germans were still left holding some important buildings.Service Activities.
SOUTH AFRICA.46. Domestic issues faded into the background for a time with the publica-tion of a cable which the Opposition leader, Dr. Malan, sent to Mr. de Valera,defending the latter&apos;s action in relation to the United States request. general smuts described the cable as without precedent, and laughable, especially as theOpposition, having suffered a clear defeat in the recent elections, could not possibly speak for a &quot; very large section of the population of South Africa.&quot;47. General Smuts, in a speech during the debate on the Prime Minister&apos;sand External Affairs Department&apos;s Vote on the 17th March, said that therewere two extreme tendencies as regards the future of the British Commonwealth.One was to regard the Commonwealth ties as too strong, and to work for theirrelaxation, which in Eire and in the Union meant a republic. The other was toview the ties as too loose, and to try to strengthen them by the conception of a federal super-state of the British Empire. He was opposed to relaxation, becauseSouth Africa had the fullest authority and sovereignty as things were, andisolation meant danger for a country with great resources and little man-power;and also to federation, because the present basis of consultation and co-operationhad been developed &quot;not by thinkers and philosophers but by experience.&quot;General Smuts said, &apos;&apos; I stand firm by our rights as set out in our Status Actsand the Statute of Westminster.&quot;48. Speaking of the forthcoming meeting of Prime Ministers in London,General Smuts said that he was going to London with a feeling of profoundresponsibility, and he would like to go with the goodwill, in a large sense, of all sections of the South African people, among whom, despite political differences,there was growing a deep sense of national unity. He said justice would not bedone to Africa while the curious colonial set-up of the African continentremained, in which the Union, a Dominion with sovereign status, is sandwichedin between little territories which do not belong to the Union and where differentpolicies are pursued by the Mother country of these territories. &quot; I feel that something is due not only to South Africa but to Africa. We have taken a great part in the war.&quot; In regard to the Union&apos;s foreign policy, General Smuts said,&apos;&apos; I am all for our own policy, but I am most anxious, in the dangerous world inwhich we live, to shape my policy in a way which will harmonise to some extentwith the interests of our friends,&quot; and, he added, &quot; &apos; Our friends &apos; will not be confined to the British Commonwealth.&quot;- 49. There is growing disappointment at the failure of the Government tocome forward with a comprehensive programme of legislature dealing with post-war problems, as was promised before the Session opened, and the recent debate on immigration has been criticised for the low level at which it was conducted,leaving it to &quot; eccentric enthusiasts of the back benchers.&quot;50. Nationalist opposition criticism of the Governments war policy hasalmost ceased, and Nationalists, both in the press and Parliament, are now beginning attacks on the Government&apos;s administration of sundry defence matters. The Labour party has been increasingly aggressive in its criticism ofthe Government in the House of Assembly. Labour Party spokesmen say that,while they continue to support the war effort, they reserve the right to criticise the Governments internal policy. This would appear to be a preparation for a future break.51. Surprise has been caused by the sudden decision of the Mining Unionof the Rand to postpone the reopening of negotiations with tlhe Chamber of Minesuntil the 17th April, and in the meantime to take a strike ballot as a means of strengthening the Union&apos;s representatives. The ballot results so far availableshow an overwhelming majority in favour of a strike to enforce the demand fora 30 per cent, increase in wages.52. The Prime Minister&apos;s statement on the appointment of a Governor-General, that he would, advise the King, to appoint a Union national, and thatthe person appointed should be a bilingual, has naturally found a warm recep-tion by the supporters of Hertzog policy. Only one pro-Government paperexpresses any criticism.  -
EIRE.53. The outstanding development in Eire during March was the announce-ment on the 11th March that the Eire Government had on the 21st Februarybeen requested by the United States Government, with the support of the UnitedKingdom Government, to sever diplomatic and consular relations with Germanyand Japan. As was stated in the United States Note and in the statement madeby the Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the 14th March, this stepwas taken for security reasons and was based on the possibility that Axis officials in Dublin might supply the German Government with information regardingfuture military operations which would aid the German High Command andendanger Allied lives. Mr. de Valera rejected the request with the observationthat if Eire had demanded the removal of the German and Japanese representa-tives from Dublin they would have taken the first step towards war. Mr. de valera also claimed that the Eire Government had by every means in their powerendeavoured to prevent leakage of information, but did not deal with the main point in the United States Note, viz., the position in the future.54. The Eire Government was assured &quot;by the United States Minister thatno action, military or otherwise, was contemplated against Eire in consequenceof this refusal.55. The United States action has been welcomed by all Dominion Govern-ments, and by the world&apos;s press generally. The most notable dissentient voiceshave been those of Dr. Malan in South Africa and the Roman Catholic ArchbishopMannix in Australia.56. In Eire itself there was general support, in which all political parties have joined, for Mr. de Valera&apos;s action in refusing the United States request.General Mulcahy, the leader of the Fine Gael party, said that his party had approved of the Governments decision and that so much was their agreementwith Mr. de Valera that they had been prepared to see the reply which had beensent to the United States Note and to that extent associated themselves in thematter. They stayed not merely behind the Government, but completely in line with it. &quot; We support the Prime Minister in the determination of this countryto stand for neutrality and his expression of friendly feelings for the peopleof America. There should not be any reason why it should not be possible tomaintain our neutrality and to prevent our country being used in any way whichwould do injury to Great Britain.&quot;57. On the 13th March the reimposition of severe restrictions on travelbetween Great Britain and Ireland (both Eire and Northern Ireland) was announced. The Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons on the14th March that this was the first step in the policy designed to isolate GreatBritain from Southern Ireland, and Southern Ireland from the outside worldduring the critical period now approaching.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.General. \58. There is again no significant development to report in the politicalsituation. There is no evidence in the reports received that the Viceroy&apos;s speech to the Legislature in February has yet borne fruit in any constructive effort to solve the communal issue or to face the preparatory work essential to further constitutional advance. The recent spectacle of Congress and Moslem Leaguegoing together into the Opposition Lobby of the Legislative Assembly andcombining to defeat Government eight times during the present session has attracted attention in some quarters, but is no evidence that the two parties are coming together. Both are &quot; agin&apos; the Government,&quot; while the 18 Congressmembers (about half the strength of the party in the Assembly) who decided last autumn to resume their seats in the Assembly did so against the advice of their leaders. Mr. Jinnah&apos;s speech as Aligarh University on the 8th March showedno diminution of his refusal to compromise on the subject of Pakistan.
59. A noteworthy event during the month was the arrival in India of thefirst Dominion High Commissioner to be appointed to India Sir Iven Mackay,High Commissioner for Australia. The selection of an Indian to fill the reciprocalappointment of High Commissioner for India in Australia is expected to be madeshortly. At the same time the Department of the Government of India (hithertoknown as the Department for Indians Overseas) which will henceforth beresponsible for the conduct of India&apos;s relations with the Dominions has beenrenamed the Department of Commonwealth Relations.External and Frontier Relations.60. Afghanistan. ?The Prime Minister seemed to have nearly recovered from his recent illness and to be taking part in all discussions on important matters, although he was still taking care of himself and did not, as formerly,attend to routine business in his office. There were indications that he and hisGovernment are becoming increasingly apprehensive about the policy of theU.S.S.R., and that they are very much interested in the question whether theUnited States of America will continue after the war to play a part in ensuringworld peace and prosperity. There was no overt trouble in the Southern Province,though certain incidents caused anxiety and precautionary measures were taken.But the Government, conscious of their weakness and unpopularity in theProvince, were clearly reluctant to use force in dealing with turbulent elements.The Afghan Government have informed His Majesty&apos;s Minister that they wishto send a military mission to India to inspect and purchase armaments. they also asked for military training facilities for officers. There was no change inthe economic situation. The supply of wool to Russia under the recent agreementproceeded smoothly. A Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and china was signed at Angora on the 2nd March. The Treaty provides for the exchangeof diplomatic mission and consulates. The Afghan Government are in particularanxious to have a representative in Sinkiang.61. North-West Frontier Province. The Faqir of Ipi remained in CentralWaziristan, punitive air action having failed to induce the local tribes to ejecthim. On the other hand, the action taken by Government and internal dissen-sions increased the reluctance of the local Mahsuds and Wazirs to support theFaqir&apos;s design of general hostilities against the Government of India.62. Nepal. In his report on conditions in Nepal during 1943, which was recently received, His Majesty&apos;s Minister stated that the required number ofGurkha recruits for the Indian Army was easily obtained and that the quality of the men coming forward was better than at any time since the first year ofthe war.63. Sinkiang. Further progress was made in the integration of theProvince with the Chungking Government, which in the words of His Majesty&apos;sConsul at Urumchi &quot; appears to be genuinely anxious to give the non-Chineseraces within the Province a very fair imitation of equality with the Chinese.&quot;64. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Urumchi was recently informed by a Chineseofficial that Chinese troops engaged in suppressing banditry on the Sinkiangside of the outer Mongolia border were attacked by Soviet aircraft. The SovietConsul-General, to whom a protest was made, refused to accept it as being&quot;provocative,&quot; but it is understood that the Chinese Minister for ForeignAffairs has succeeded in getting the Soviet Ambassador to refer the matter to moscow. The local&apos; Representative of the Central Chinese Government professed-to believe that the object of the Soviet was to test Chinese reactions before lendingassistance to Communists in China.65. Persian Gulf: The Sultan of Muscat left at the end of March for athree months&apos; visit to Egypt and the Middle East, which he has not seen before.Besides Egypt, he is proposing to visit the Sudan, Palestine and Syria. He istravelling incognito, and has expressed his intention of calling on the King ofEgypt and the British Ambassador while in Cairo.66. The United States Minister in Iraq went on a tour early in the monthalong the Arab Coast of the Gulf. He visited Kuwait and Bahrain, but no report has yet been received on his activities in these places.
Economic and Social.67. Food. The final estimate of the rice crop just harvested puts it at30 - 6 million tons or about 4 million tons above normal. The result of the wheatharvest now beginning is uncertain : it may be up to average; it certainly willnot reach last year&apos;s high figure. The problem is now largely one of the restora-tion of public confidence to ensure the procurement of surplus grain from the50 million small cultivators.68. Peasant cultivators in Bengal, as elsewhere, are cautious folk andremembering last year&apos;s famine and high prices they are not parting with theirsurplus grain easily until they are convinced that Government are in full control of the situation and have adequate reserves. Endeavours are being madeto induce sales by better propaganda; by counter-propaganda to defeat the opponents of the Government; by enforcement of recovery of rents and loans;and by an increased supply of consumer goods. Requisitioning plans are in preparation for use, if need be, as a last resort.69. Substantial imports of wheat have been promised by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the second and third quarters of 1944 but not sufficient in them-selves to cover increased demands for feeding the troops.70. Rationing systems have now been introduced in 130 towns covering25 million people, but unless a reduction can be brought about in the present high prices the principal sufferers in last year&apos;s famine, viz., the lower middle-classes, the landless labourer, and the beggar, will again be in difficulties in bengal.71. Endeavours are being made to strengthen the administrative staff in bengal.72. Bengal Health Situation.- There is continued improvement in thecholera and malaria situations. The number of anti-cholera inoculations andvaccinations performed since November up to the end of March was about million and 9 million respectively. There is still difficulty in recruitingmedical staff, and the Bengal Government are considering an improvement inthe scale of pay offered. Owing to military requirements, military medical reliefunits are being withdrawn from civil duty at the end of April and a part ofthe military public health personnel by the end of May. After rather prolongedconsideration, the Bengal Government have agreed that it is desirable that theyshould assume direct control from the district authorities over hospitals in theProvince and the district public health officers. Central legislation will benecessary to give Provincial Governments the required powers and this is underconsideration. &quot;73. Anti-Hoarding measures. -A Hoarding and Profiteering PreventionOrdinance has been in operation in India since October last. Its purpose is toprovide an effective instrument for preventing these practices in respect of consumer goods in general throughout British India. It is applicable to allarticles other than food-grains, commodities already subject to control by other means, and such articles as may be specifically exempted from its scope.74. It empowers the Central Government to fix in respect of any articlethe maximum quantity which may at any time be held by a dealer or producer,the maximum quantity which may be sold in any one transaction and themaximum price which may be charged by a dealer or producer.75. It is not yet possible to estimate the full effect of; this Ordinance,enforcement of which is clearly a difficult matter, but it has caused some con-cern amongst traders and has even led to the cancelling of orders for consumer goods placed in the expectation of continued high prices.76. Industrial Development of India.- A good deal of interest is beingtaken in India in the post-war industrial development of the country. much attention has been attracted by a skeleton scheme published by a group of bombay industrialists outlining plans for the expenditure of Rs. 10,000 crores( =  7,500 million) on the economic development of India generally over a periodof 15 years. It is proposed to expand the industrial output of India by 500 percent, and its agricultural output by 100 per cent. The plan is generally welcomed as an active encouragement to Indians to think big in this field andit is admittedly not intended to be proof against criticism on points of detail.
Its fulfilment is avowedly dependent on the maintenance of the unity of Indiaunder a strong autonomous Central Government enjoying the support of all parties in India and able to borrow abroad.77. His Majesty&apos;s Government has approved a proposal made by theViceroy for the extension to eight or nine of the leaders of Indian industry ofinvitations to pay visits this summer to the United Kingdom in order to make contact with British industrialists with a view to post-war co-operation. It ispossible that the party or some members of it may subsequently visit the UnitedStates.Naval, Military and A ir Force A activities.Military.78. Italy. Indian troops of the 8th Army have been engaged in minoractivities throughout the month. Those in the 5th Army took part in the assault on Cassino, and some of them got within some 300 yards of the top of MonasteryHill, where they were held up. They maintained their positions on this hill forseveral days although cut off from the remainder of our forces. It was subsequently decided to abandon the hill and they withdrew successfully.79. North-West Frontier. Air proscription of the Shaktu River area inWaziristan, and political pressure on the Mahsuds was continued throughout themonth, with a view to the ejection of the Fakir of Ipi. The situation remainsmaterially unchanged, but there are signs that bombing and internal dissensionsare increasing the reluctance of the tribalmen to support Ipi.80. Burma. In Arakan Japanese activities continues with the probableobject of keeping as many of our troops as possible engaged. Our troops continuehowever, to make progress. The western of the two tunnels on the Maungdaw-Buthidaung road has been captured. Fighting continues South of the road andSouth-East of Buthidaung.81. In Kaladan our troops who had to withdraw from the vicinity ofKyauktaw through Japanese infiltration have now crossed the Kaladan River5 miles to the North, and are patrolling Southward along both banks.82. Japanese forces based on the Chindwin are developing an offensive in several columns into Manipur State aimed at our road and rail communications.Our troops have withdrawn from Tiddim. The Japanese have established a roadblock on the Paiel-Tamu road about half way between Palel and Tamu. further north more serious threats have developed against Imphal and Kohima. Therehas been heavy fighting some 25 miles East of Kohima. The country ismountainous and difficult, lending itself to the infiltration tactics of theJapanese; should the latter, however, debouch into the Imphal Plain our forces will have the opportunity of engaging them with all arms.83. In the Hukawng Valley progress has been made by the Chinese and american Rangers advancing towards Myitkyina. They are now some 32 miles south of Maingkwan. Our Levies continue to make progress on the road South from Sumprabum. Further to the South troops of General Wingate&apos;s force,successfully landed in troop carriers and gliders, have established themselves andare disrupting communications of the enemy opposing the Sino-American force.84. Air. The scale of activity has been very considerably increased owingto the Japanese advance, increased enemy air activity and heavy supply droppingcommitments on the Assam frontier, Arakan, and in support of the Wingateexpedition.85. R.A.F. heavy and medium bombers made widespread attacks on dumpsand railway stations. A particularly heavy raid was carried out on Rangoon.A very large number of fighter bomber sorties were flown in support of our troops on the Assam frontier. Ground attacks were also made on engines and rolling stock, M.T., river craft and airfields with good results. Enemy activity andinfiltration caused a big increase in the number of standing patrols, escortreconnaissances flown.86. U.S.A.A.F. heavy bombers flew a record number of sorties, attackingtargets in the Assam frontier and Mogaung Kamaing areas. A successful attack was made on the Siam-Burma railway. Medium bombers concentrated oncommunications leading to the battlefields. Fighter bombers and fightersattacked tactical targets and flew routine patrols and escorts.[27332] c
87. Troop carrier command in addition to transporting the troops of theairborne forces, carried over 5,000 tons of supplies and weapons and evacuatednearly 3,000 casualtiesGeneral.88. Morale. The defeat of the Japanese in Arakan, and the steadiness and high morale of our troops there have further increased the confidence of all troopsin India Command. The main complaints of British troops are still in regardto repatriation and lowness of pay.89.   The increases of pay for the Indian Army have been generally welcomed.90. Welfare. The Welfare Directorate at G.H.Q. has been expanded into aDirectorate-General with three Directorates dealing with Welfare, education and Resettlement respectively.91. Prisoners of War. During February 1944, 8,025 Italians were sent tothe United Kingdom, and 2,028 to Australia for agricultural work. Over 6,000have now been sent to Australia.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Occupied Burma.92.   No important political development was observed during the month.93. Japanese broadcasts state that on the 5th February the Ba Maw Govern-ment started a drive to cultivate more paddy. Hitherto one of the chief difficultiesencountered by the Japanese-controlled Government is the existence of a surplusof rice which cannot be exported through lack of shipping. Consequently, therehas been a marked fall in cultivation which they evidently now wish to counteract.According to our estimates, however, the 1943-44 crop is likely to produce a surplus of about 1 million tons of paddy in Burma as a whole.Frontier A dministration.94. A delicate situation has arisen in Kokang, a small State in Burmaadjoining the Burma-China Frontier which has not been occupied by theJapanese. The neighbouring local Chinese authorities have been acting in a high-handed manner; they have deposed the Ruler and subsequently arrested him on a charge (which is thought to have no foundation) of dealing with the Japanese.Negotiations are proceeding with the Chinese Central Government, who have nowordered his release and authorised his being handed over to the British authorities.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report 1&apos; Colonies &apos;&apos; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar).Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.Ceylon.95. The rice allocated to Ceylon from Ministry of Food purchases in Egypthas been coming forward much more slowly than was hoped, and in consequencethere has been a long interruption since the last shipment. The very serious con-sequences which would arise in Ceylon from allowing rice stocks to be exhaustedhave been emphasised to the British representatives in Egypt responsible for obtaining supplies and arranging shipment and I hope that a further ship cargowill leave at a very early date.
96. In view of the approaching exhaustion of purchases from this season&apos;sEgyptian rice crop and of the Government of India&apos;s inability to permit exportsof rice it has been necessary to programme further shipments from Brazil in spiteof the disadvantages from the shipping point of view.Mauritius.97. The loss of a ship carrying coconut oil from Ceylon to Mauritius hasunfortunately led to the exhaustion of stocks of imported edible oil in that island.Further supplies are being obtained as quickly as possible from Ceylon, and also from Africa, and it has been agreed that a four months&apos; reserve of edible oilshould be built up in the island as a reserve against future contingencies.Other Supplies.Northern Rhodesia.98. Discussions which the Northern Rhodesia supply representatives,Mr. Tucker and Mr. McKee (see my report for February), have been holding inthis country have now been concluded, and have resulted in agreement by thesupply authorities in this country to a substantial increase in the direct exportsof cotton textiles from the United Kingdom to Northern Rhodesia, and also in theimmediate acquisition of a special additional supply to meet the difficulties causedby the absence of stocks in Northern Rhodesia. The Northern Rhodesia repre-sentatives have expressed their gratitude for the very sympathetic help given them in this matter by the Board of Trade and the Cotton Board.Lend-Lease Supplies to Colonies.99. The United States authorities have now ruled that Palestine and other british territories in the Middle East are ineligible for Lend-Lease for civilsupplies. The majority of colonies had already been ruled ineligible for civilLend-Lease supplies, but the Middle Eastern territories had previously been allowed exceptions to this ruling as being within a combat area.Production.East African Sisal.100. In order to meet substantial increases in the cost of production, owinglargely to the very high cost of machinery and equipment supplied from theUnited States, the Ministry of Supply have agreed to increase the price paidto the producer by an average of  5 75. per ton. The East African industry has asked for a five-years&apos; guarantee to purchase as from the 1st January, 1944,but it has been decided that this is not called for by the nature of the industry, andis in conflict with general principles governing the effect of long-term contracts.The East African industry has therefore been offered a contract for purchase upto two years after the end of the war with Japan, with an option on the part ofthe Ministry of Supply to break, given six months&apos; notice, two years after theend of the war with Germany.British Guiana Bauxite.101. Under pressure, it is understood, from-the Netherlands Government,the United States authorities have been exerting pressure on the canadian authorities substantially to decrease their takings of bauxite from British Guianaand correspondingly to increase their takings from Surinam (Dutch Guiana.) TheCanadian authorities have strongly opposed this proposal, which would severelydislocate the arrangements made in British Guiana and also have an adverse effect on the Colony&apos;s finances. It has not been possible for agreement to bereached at the Combined Aluminium and Magnesium Committee in Washington,and the matter has been referred for decision to the Combined Raw MaterialsBoard.West African Cocoa.102. Substantially increased prices for the next two seasons have now been announced in respect of the Gold Coast and Nigeria, and it is hoped that this willhave the effect of encouraging farmers to pay greater attention to cultivationand so arrest the decline in production which has been manifest in the seasonjust concluded.[27332] D
Defence.West Indies.103. Arrangements have now been made to bring to England some 2,000men who have been recruited in the West Indies for ground staff duties in theE.A.F.104. Although the main body of this party will come from Jamaica, recruitsfrom all the West Indian Colonies and British -Guiana and British Honduraswill be included.105. The White Bermudian troops to be brought to Europe will consistof four officers and 106 other ranks. They will serve with the LincolnshireRegiment with which a number of Bermudians served in the last war.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.106. The attitude of both communities to the war, and to each other,remained substantially the same during the past month.107. There was little Arab political activity of note. Negotiations for theformation of a representative body of Palestinian Arabs appear to have been dropped for the time being. In recent party manceuvrings, only the PalestinianArab (Husseini) party displayed any degree of internal solidarity; this hasnaturally tended to enhance their prestige. The party launched a campaign forthe release from detention in Southern Rhodesia of Jamal Husseini and AminTamimi, but negative replies were returned to representations on their behalf.108. Little interest has been shown in Mr. Ben Gurion&apos;s resumption of thechairmanship of the Jewish Agency Executive, announced on the 3rd March.He appears to have been persuaded to take this step on the strength of assurancesby the Agency Delegation now in London that understanding had been reached with Dr. Weizmann over the future conduct of Zionist policy. Mr. Ben Gurionhas been preoccupied in attempting to settle internal wrangling in the Mapaiand the Histadruth and to secure a united front in all-out support of the Biltmoreprogramme.109. The introduction of the Resolution on Palestine in the AmericanCongress caused elation amongst the Jews and resentment amongst the Arabs.These feelings were reversed on the deferment of the Motion; and reversed again on the announcement of President Roosevelt&apos;s statement to the Rabbis Wise and silver.110. In rural areas, public security generally was satisfactory. Theprincipal towns, however, have been the scenes of further incidents in the cam-paign of Jewish terrorism, of which the instruments were the Irgun, Zvai Leumiand the Stern Group. These included the shooting and wounding of Britishpolicemen in Tel Aviv on the 2nd March; the murder of a Jewish policeman inPetah Tikvah on the 13th March; and the exchange of shots with the police inTel Aviv on the 16th March.111. The worst crimes, however, yet committed were those in Jerusalem.Tel Aviv, Jaffa and Haifa on the 23rd March, when seven British police officers were murdered either by shooting or bomb explosions; one other was gravelywounded and his condition is critical. There was also serious damage byexplosives to police buildings. All these outrages were committed by Jews.Curfews have been imposed and the death penalty for carrying arms, sabotage,&amp;c, re-introduced.112. Notwithstanding the complete lack of practical co-operation on thepart of the Jewish authorities and the public, the police were successful inarresting a number of suspects. Twenty were rounded up on the 2nd March, andother arrests have been made, including the leading member of the Stern Group,who was captured after a chase by the police, during which he threw away apistol and a package containing gelignite, &amp;c. On the 19th March another SternGroup man was chased by the police up the stairs of a Tel Aviv house. Afteropening fire on the police he was shot dead.113.   The official cost of living index remained unchanged at 233.
13li?West Indies.114. The first West Indian Conference, the setting up of which was reported in the report for January, has been held in Barbados in the last half ofthis month. It was under the chairmanship of the British co-chairman of theAnglo-American Caribbean Commission, and two delegates, including oneunofficial, attended from each of the British Colonies in the area and from PuertoRico and the United States Virgin Islands. Observers also attended from canada, the Dutch West Indies and the French West Indies. The Conferenceconsidered means of raising the nutritional level in the Caribbean by local foodproduction and the expansion of fisheries, the reabsorption into civil life ofpersons engaged in war employment, planning of public works, health protectionW and quarantine, industrial development and the Caribbean Research Counciland the possibilities of its expansion. A report is not yet available as to the out-come of the Conference.115. A meeting of the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission was heldimmediately before and after the Conference.Jamaica.116. A somewhat serious stoppage of work occurred on the Kingston water-front on the 15th March in connection with the labourers&apos; demands relating to conditions of work, and the position has been aggravated by the irresponsibleattitude adopted by Bustamante, the labour leader, who the Governor states isunquestionably unbalanced.117. The strike terminated on the 21st March, and on the next day theShipping Association and the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union concluded anagreement which is to be effective until the 30th September, 1946, and providesfor improved rates of pay.118. On the 24th March there was a partial strike by the employees of oneof the largest motor-bus undertakings. This did not result in disruption of theservice, which was carried on under police protection with the use of volunteerdrivers and conductors. The matter was referred to&apos; the Industrial (Defence)Tribunal, which issued an award largely in favour of the workers. This awardis now being challenged in the courts with a view to its being set aside.Bermuda.119. Lord Burghley, Governor of Bermuda, has been in this country on ashort visit and the opportunity has been taken of discussing various matters oflocal interest with him.Fiji.Dispute in the Sugar Industry.120. On the 15th March I announced, in Parliament that ProfessorC. Y. Shephard, of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad, had accepted an invitation to conduct an enquiry into certain aspects of the Fiji sugar industry and make recommendations as to the future. This announcement waswell received in the Colony, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company withdrewthe notices it had issued terminating the tenancies of certain cane farmers.121. The Governor reports that growers everywhere are satisfied with theannouncement and greatly relieved by* the withdrawal of notices. There are indications that they intend to resume the planting of cane.Cyprus.122. A strike affecting some 1,800 men, most of whom were employed bythe Government of Cyprus or the army on military works, took place, in Cyprusbetween the 1st and the 24th March. The strike followed a demand for increased wages which the Government was not prepared to grant, as wages had on theaverage been increased during the war to an extent commensurate fully with thecost of living. On the 13th March about 5,000 additional men struck in symapathy for one day. In order to ensure the continuance of essential military works a contingent of skilled workmen was brought from the mainland and. a workshopcompany of the Cyprus Volunteer Force was called up.
123. The Government undertook to carry out a full enquiry into the relation between wages and the cost of living and into all other questions affectingconditions of employment. This undertaking was made public on the 13th Marchand the strike ended on the 24th. The enquiry started immediately after work was resumed.Labour.124. For the discussions on item 5 (Minimum Standards of Social Policyin Dependent Territories) in the Agenda of the International Labour conference to be held at Philadelphia in April, the Colonial Office will be represented by an assistant Under-Secretary of State, my Labour Adviser and the IndustrialAdviser to the Government of Trinidad.
