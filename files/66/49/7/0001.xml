THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1944.INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by Secretary of State for India.I circulate, for the information of the War Cabinet, telegrams received fromthe Government of India reporting instructions sent to the Indian HighCommissioner in South Africa for the delivery of a note to the Union Govern-ment relating to the recent discriminatory legislation against Indians in SouthAfrica. The note warns the Union Government that in the absence of an earlyamelioration of the position created by the legislation the Government of india will be forced to take retaliatory action.This note is a sequel to the &apos;&apos; pegging &apos;&apos; legislation enacted a year ago bythe South African Government. The Act, known as the Trading and Occupation---of Land (Transvaal and Natal) Restriction Act, No. 35 of 1943, was passed inconsequence of the widespread uneasiness aroused by the revelations of an officialenquiry that Indians, particularly in Durban, had been purchasing properties onan extensive scale in European areas. The Act, which prolonged the validity ofexisting legislation in the Transvaal and applied it to Natal, was a &quot; stand-stilljmeasure,&quot; designed to peg the situation for three years and prevent furtherIndian &quot; penetration &quot; pending the report of a Judicial Commission which wasto be set up to investigate the housing, educational and other facilities availablefor Indians in Natal.The Government of India, through their High Commissioner, madeunavailing representations to the Union Government before the Bill became law.Its enactment provoked violent resentment among all sections of opinion in Indiaand very strong pressure has continued to be exerted on the Government of Indiato exercise powers under their recently passed Reciprocity Act and applyretaliatory measures against the South African Government. Lord Wavell andhis predecessor have reported that even in their Executive Council feeling is verybitter, and though both Viceroys have continued to urge moderation and pointout the folly of retaliation (which is likely to injure Indian trade more thanSouth African) it is now clear that the Viceroy can no longer resist the public demand. Personal appeals which he recently made to Field-Marshal Smuts haveapparently failed to evoke sufficient response to delay the present action of theGovernment of India.I deplore this development so shortly before the meeting of Dominion PrimeMinisters, but I am bound to recognise the strength of feeling in India which is extremely sensitive in regard to the treatment of Indians in British territoriesoverseas. His Majesty&apos;s Government have deliberately refrained so far fromovert intervention in regard to this South African legislation.. On the 4th May, 1943-, the Secretary of State for the Dominions (Mr. Attlee)stated in reply to a question in the House of Commons that there had been nocorrespondence or negotiations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the UnionGovernment in connection with the Act and added that &quot; the matter is one which,in accordance with the recognised principles of inter-Imperial relations, hasbeen dealt with directly between the Government of India through its HighCommissioner in South Africa and the Union Government.&quot;L. S. A.India Office, VIth April, 1944.CONFIDENTIAL. /   Copy No.   3W.P. (44) 207.17 th April, 1944.WAR CABINET.[27290]
Cypher   Telegrams  from  Government   of India,&apos; [Commonwealth  RelationsDepartment, to Secretary of State for India.Dated 15th April, 1944.No. 4369.In our two immediately succeeding telegrams we repeat instructions given toSir Shafaat Ahmad Khan and text of note to be delivered by him to UnionGovernment. First measure of retaliation would be denunciation of trade agree-ment with Union.No. 4370.Addressed to High Commissioner for India, Cape Town, repeated toSecretary of State for India.Your telegram No. 732 of 1st April. Government of India have for many months had under consideration retaliatory action against Union includingapplication of Reciprocity Act, recall of High Commissioner and denunciation oftrade agreement and other economic sanctions. Action was suspended last november in the hope that Field-Marshal Smuts would make a new approach tothe problem. This hope has not been fully realised, and while Government ofIndia welcome and have no desire to impede in any way discussions betweenField-Marshal Smuts and South African Indian Congress, they must make itclear that feeling in India is so strong that in the absence of concrete action byUnion Government they cannot defer retaliatory measures any longer. you should accordingly deliver to Union Government the note set out in immediatelysucceeding telegram. Pending reply from Union Government you should not press franchise and housing questions. You should be careful not to give theimpression that Government of India are instigating Indian community in SouthAfrica to refuse to negotiate.No. 4371.Addressed to High Commissioner for India, Cape Town, repeated toSecretary of State for India.Following is text of note referred to in my immediately preceding telegram.Begins: The Union Government are aware of the resentment caused in india by Pegging legislation enacted in the Union last year. The Government of india have been under constant pressure from all parties to take counter-measures against the Union, but have so far refrained from doing so because they hopedthat Pegging Act (which the Union Government declared to be temporary) wouldbe repealed once the emergency for which it arose had been eased, or that analternative solution acceptable to both sides would be adopted.2. These hopes were revived by recent news of discussions between PrimeMinister and Indian interests in the Union. The Government of India welcomethese discussions and have no desire to impede them in any way. But indian opinion will not be satisfied except by concrete action, and unless discussionsresult within a reasonable time in action satisfactory to India the Governmentof India will be compelled to take counter-measures.3. Government of India believe that an alternative to Pegging legislationcan be found which will give the Union Government such control as may be needed over development and will not at the same time place Indians as suchin a position of inferiority. They consider that discussions/should be directed to finding this alternative solution and that as soon as it is found Pegging legisla-tion should be repealed or if this is not possible without protracted administrative and legislative action areas affected by it should be de-proclaimed. Nothingshort of a very early solution on these lines or, failing that, immediatede-proclaiming of areas affected by legislation will enable Government of Indiato abandon counter-measures they have planned, and they would be grateful forreply by the end of April.
