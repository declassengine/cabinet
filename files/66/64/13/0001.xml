THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT54Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET. Copy No.  0 3W.P. (45) 213.15th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.SOUTHERN AFRICA AIR TRANSPORT CONFERENCE-MARCH, 1945.Memorandum by the Minister for Civil Aviation.I reported in a series of telegrams the progress of the Cape Town Conference,but I think my colleagues would like to have in a single document a record of thework done there.2. The Conference included Delegations from the Union of South Africa,the United Kingdom, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, theEast African Colonies (represented by the Governor of Kenya as Chairman^ ofthe East African Governors&apos; Conference), and the United Kingdom HighCommissioner, who attended as a member of the United Kingdom Delegation,and also represented the High Commission territories.3. In opening the Conference Field-Marshal Smuts said that we should aim at ^putting our own house in order and so set an example of co-operation to theworld. We certainly succeeded in the former, as we reached complete agreement on every subject.4. We dealt with all the Commonwealth air services in the territoriesrepresented, the trunk route from the United Kingdom to South Africa, thelocal services in the Union, in the Rhodesias and in East Africa, the regionalservices between the three groups of territories, and other inter-territorial services with neighbouring foreign territories.5. The trunk service was particularly important, as it was the first detailed application of the principles of co-operation in parallel air operation which wehad agreed in the Commonwealth conversations in Montreal and London. Thearrangements we made with regard to this service were so comprehensive and satisfactory that I think they merit a full summary :  (a) The number of &quot;frequencies&quot; will be determined by the amount oftraffic offering, and will be shared equally between B.O.A.C. andSouth African Airways. It is intended to start the service in July;and it is expected that the traffic will justify working up to a dailyservice each way.(b) Revenue will be pooled and shared in proportion to the frequenciesoperated.(c) Each company will bear its own expenses.   The bulk of the expenditurecan be identified as directly attributable and will be charged direct,but a comparatively few items of common user expenditure will be apportioned on an agreed basis.(d) The companies will use the same type of aircraft : at first Yorks, laterTudor IPs. We have agreed to lease Yrorks to the South african government until the Tudors are ready. The South African Govern-ment have agreed to buy Tudors. This agreement proves the value ofthe arrangement the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of aircraft Production and I have agreed for the leasing of interimtypes of aircraft,This agreement is particularly gratifying because the UnitedStates Government took unusual steps to persuade the South Africans[29733] B
2to buy American aircraft. They arranged for a special &apos;&apos; Skymaster &apos;&apos;(C. 54) to be flown to Gape Town for the Conference, and for a seniorrepresentative of the Douglas Company to be on the spot. It had onboard a crew well trained in salesmanship. The public were invitedto inspect the aircraft, and many nights with appetising meals were offered to Members of Parliament, officials and the Press. Nor werethe ladies neglected, as mascots of Douglas aircraft in gold (?) were distributed as souvenirs. All this was accompanied by much salestalk, including depreciation of British aircraft. The York, however,gave a good performance with a number of the Press on board, duringwhich it demonstrated its ability to climb on two engines.(e) It was agreed that South African Airways will look after the interests,commercial and technical, of B.O.A.C. within the territory South ofNairobi, and that B.O.A.C. will act similarly on behalf of SouthAfrican Airways within the territories between Nairobi and theUnited Kingdom. 1(/) A Committee of Experts, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Schonland,worked out all the meteorological services, communications and flyingaids required in the various territories for regular day and nightflying along the route.(g) On Postal arrangements it was agreed that we should avoid prejudicing the future of the EmDire Air Mail Scheme, and we should continueour respective pre-war contributions under the Scheme for a periodof a year, so that there may be ample time for the commonwealth countries to review the Scheme.6. The Conference recorded their approval of the above agreement in thefolio wins; terms : -&quot; The Conference notes with satisfaction the arrangements made forthe inauguration and operation of the trunk service between the UnitedKingdom and South Africa under which the British Overseas airways corporation and South African Airways will operate reciprocal services onan agreed partnership basis.&quot;7. It is intended, that the stopping places along the route shall be: a mediterranean airport, Cairo, Khartoum, Nairobi, Salisbury, and Johannesburg.We had full discussions and reached agreement on the necessary dimensionsof the airfields. South Africa will have an adequate temporary airfield nearJohannesburg pending the construction of their big permanent airport atJohannesburg.The airnelds at Salisbury and Nairobi will require considerable extension.We had a full investigation at Nairobi on our way back, and the Governor will besubmitting proposals which we all agreed are the satisfactory solution.Salisbury may be a difficulty. The expense involved in making a satisfactoryairfield there will be considerable, and it is uncertain whether the SouthernPhodesian Government will be prepared to undertake it. It is most important to have an adequate airfield either at Salisbury or at Lusaka, as a direct flightfrom Nairobi to Johannesburg is very uneconomic, involving a stage 650 mileslonger than any other on the route. If it were decided to use Lusaka this w^ouldprobably involve the construction of a new airfield, as I understand that theexisting airfield at Lusaka could not be made satisfactory.8. The Conference passed the following resolution setting up an Air Trans-port Council for Southern Africa :  &quot; The Conference is of the opinion that the civil aviation needs ofSouthern Africa can best be served by full co-operation in organisation, and operation and in furtherance of that object approves of the establishment ofa Southern Africa Air Transport Council, the constitution and functions ofwhich are set out in the Annex hereto.&quot;9. It was agreed that each group of territories should be responsible for itsown internal air services and that regional services connecting the territories should be co-ordinated with the internal services through the machinery of theSouthern Africa Air Transport Council. The Conference passed the followingresolution : The Conference having discussed the regional and local services whichit is contemplated will be established within and between the SouthernAfrican territories represented at the Conference records its opinion that in
the establishment and operation of such services the following principles should apply : (a) Local services should both serve the requirements for air transportwithin the territories and should afford suitable connections withthe main trunk route and with regional routes.(b) The routing of regional services within the territories of Common-wealth and Empire countries in Southern Africa will normally be a matter for discussion by the Southern Africa Air transport council so that the interests of regional and local services may become-ordinated and protected to their mutual advantage and the convenience of the travelling public. The recommendations of theCouncil will be submitted to the Governments concerned forapproval.(c) It shall be competent for the Southern Africa Air Transport Councilto make representations, inter alia, in regard to internal services in commonwealth and Empire countries in Southern Africa where these are not satisfactorily co-ordinated with the trunk and regional services.&apos;&apos;10. We had a good deal of discussion on how best to secure the co-operationof neighbouring Belgian, French and Portuguese territories which will haveservices connecting with one or more of the Southern African countries. It wasdecided that the Southern Africa Air Transport Council, linked as it is withthe Commonwealth Air Transport Council, should be confined to commonwealth countries, and that foreign co-operation could best be achieved by direct inter-governmental arrangements and by the inclusion of foreign air lines in an-association of operators covering Southern Africa. The Conference accordinglypassed the following resolution : &apos;&quot; The Conference notes with satisfaction that it is the intention ofthe air line operators of the countries represented at the Conference to estab-lish, consequent upon the deliberations of the Conference, an Operators&apos;Association for Southern Africa on which all British and foreign operatorsin the region would be invited to be represented, it being understood that members of the Association shall submit to their respective governments or other appropriate authorities such matters as Governments or other authorities may require.&quot;11. The Conference welcomed the arrangements which have been made forthe establishment in the United Kingdom of a training organisation and the offer of the United Kingdom authorities to make available, as the war situation allows,facilities for the training in this organisation of air line personnel from the territories represented at the Conference.12. I attach in the Appendix to this paper the full text of all the resolu-tions passed at the Conference. The first eleven resolutions have been published.Resolutions 12, 13, and 14 are not for publication.13. The last two resolutions are of particular importance. Resolution 13recommends that the principles to be embodied in bilateral agreements negotiated by Commonwealth and Empire countries shall include the &apos;&apos; Standard Clauses &apos;&apos;which, as my colleagues are aware, embody, in a form suitable for bilateral agree-ments, the final British proposals at Chicago.14. Resolution 14 recommends that the Governments represented at theConference shall not, without prior reference to the Southern Africa Air Trans-port Council, engage in formal negotiations or make agreements with foreigncountries for the establishment of air services operating in Southern Africa.15. The firm adherence of the South African Government to these principleswas evidenced by their inviting us to draft with them the agreement which theyshould make with the United States.16. I think my colleagues will agree that this was a remarkable achievementfor a Conference which lasted six days; and the whole atmosphere of the Con-ference was as agreeable as its results; it was a real partnership gathering.IV. On my way back, I spent several days in Cairo, as the Egyptian Govern-ment had invited me to see all they are doing in civil aviation.   I was very[29733] b 2
cordially received and the visit was particularly opportune, as the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement for a joint operating company was hanging fire, owing to theassassination of the former Prime Minister. The Ambassador and I had a longdiscussion with the new Prime Minister, and with the Minister of Defence whois responsible for civil aviation. I also had talks with the Egyptian Director-General of Civil Aviation, and with the Directors of Misr air work, the EgyptianAir Line Company, and the Misr Bank, which controls Misr air work. the americans are very active in Egypt and are not only trying to capture the aircraftmarket, but are attempting to acquire a share in Misr air work. The directors of Misr air work assured me that they had no intention of selling shares to the americans and that they were wholeheartedly in favour of the proposed partner-ship with B.O.A.C. Just before I left, the Prime Minister sent me word thathe had appreciated our talk and that his Government wished to work with us.18. The Americans are still trying hard to secure a lease for civil aviationof the airfield which they have constructed near Cairo. The Egyptian Governmentwere greatly pleased at the assurance I gave and repeated at a Press Conference,that it was our desire and intention that all our civil aircraft should use theEgyptian Governments airfields at Cairo and Alexandria. It would be unwise to count on an Egyptian certainty until we have it &quot; in the bag,&quot; but it looks asif our proposals will be accepted.19. I visited Malta for a few hours on the way home, and was able to confirm the assurance that some of the aircraft on the trunk services would makea stop there. I found that they were keen, after the war, to start a short-rangelocal service connecting with Italy, Sicily and North Africa. The Lieutenant-Governor said the capital would be provided locally but that they would wishto have a management contract or expect assistance from B.OA.C.S.Ariel House, 15th April, 1945.APPENDIX.Resolutions for Formal Adoption by the Conference at its closing plenary session on Saturday, 24th March, 1945.IT is agreed that resolutions and recommendations of the Conference shallbe in harmony with and subject to the obligations undertaken by the Common-wealth Governments concerned as a result of the International Civil AviationConference at Chicago.2. The Conference endorses, so far as it is concerned, the proposal whichhas already been accepted in principle by Commonwealth countries, that on thetechnical committees of the Interim Council constituted in accordance with theterms of Article III of the Interim Agreement on International Civil Aviation,Commonwealth countries should pool their representation so far as may be practicable and desirable on a mutual basis.3. It is agreed that any Southern African organisation that may be estab-lished by the Conference shall co-operate with the Commonwealth Air transport council in formulating proposals, to be submitted in due time by the appropriate authority to the Interim Council, with the object of promoting multilateral hgsee-ment on air transport questions left undecided by the International Civil AviationConference, Chicago, 1944.4. The Conference agrees that the development in Africa of civil aviationshould be commensurate with the interests and requirements of the areas andpopulations concerned and be within the framework of and in harmony with anygeneral security plan.5. The Conference is of the opinion that the civil aviation needs of southern africa can best be served by full co-operation in organisation and operation andin furtherance of that object approves of the establishment of a Southern AfricaAir Transport Council the constitution and functions of which are set out inthe Annex hereto.6. The Conference recognises that participation in regional services by foreign Governments within the Region is desirable, and recommends that the
planning of such services should afford scope for co-operation by them withinthe orbit of a general operational scheme or, alternatively, if such general co-operation should not prove feasible, for co-operation on the basis of bilateral agreements confined to particular routes and services.7. The Conference notes with satisfaction the arrangements made for the inauguration and operation of the trunk service between the United Kingdomand South Africa under which the British Overseas Airways Corporation andSouth African Airways will operate reciprocal services on an agreed partnershipbasis.8. The Conference having discussed the regional and local services whichit is contemplated will be established within and between the Southern african territories represented at the Conference records its opinion that in the estab-lishment and operation of such services the following principles should apply : (a) Local services should both serve the requirements for air transport withinthe territories and should afford suitable connections with the maintrunk route and with regional routes.(b) The routing of regional services within the territories of commonwealth and Empire countries in Southern Africa will normally be a matter for discussion by the Southern Africa Air Transport Council so thatthe interests of regional and local services may be co-ordinated andprotected to their mutual advantage and the convenience of the travelling public. The recommendations of the Council will besubmitted to the Governments concerned for approval.(c) It shall be competent for the Southern Africa Air Transport Council tomake representations, inter alia, in regard to internal services in commonwealth and Empire countries in Southern Africa where theseare not satisfactorily co-ordinated with the trunk and regionalservices.9. The Conference notes with satisfaction that it is the intention of theairline operators of the countries represented at the Conference to establish,consequent upon the deliberations of the Conference, an Operators&apos; Associationfor Southern Africa on which all British and foreign operators in the regionwould be invited to be represented, it being understood that members of theAssociation shall submit to their respective Governments or other appropriate authorities such matters as Governments or other authorities may require.10. The Conference welcomes the -arrangements which are being made forthe establishment in the United Kingdom of a training organisation for british air transport and the offer of the United Kingdom authorities to make available,as the war situation allows, facilities for the training in this organisation ofairline personnel from the Southern Africa territories represented at theConference.11. The Conference records its thanks to the Secretariat for the admirablearrangements made throughout the Conference.12. The Conference, having taken note of the provisions in the Final act of the International Civil Aviation Conference, Chicago, 1944, for the &quot; immediate and continuing study&quot; of the Draft Technical Annexes adopted by that conference, agrees that any suggestions which the Commonwealth governments represented at the present Conference may wish to make for additions, deletionsor amendments should, so far as may be practicable, be submitted in the firstinstance to the Commonwealth Air Transport Council.13. The Conference recommends that the principles to be embodied inbilateral agreements negotiated by Commonwealth and Empire countries should include those set out in Conference Document No. 3/1.14. The Conference recommends that the Governments represented at theConference shall not, without prior reference to the Southern Africa. air transport Council, engage in formal negotiations or make agreements withforeign countries for the establishment of air services operating in southern africa.
