Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET./Copy No.W.P. (45) 202.29th March, 1945./war CABINET.DISSOLUTION OF  POLISH NATIONAL  COUNCIL.Memorandum by the&quot; Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith the translation of a decree issued onthe 21st March by the President of Poland and countersigned by the PolishPrime Minister, dissolving the present National Council, the nominated advisory body which has been acting in this country as a Polish Parliament in exile, andrecording the decision to appoint as soon as possible a differently composedCouncil.2. Members of this Department have been informed by M. Mikolajczyk andby M. Kulerski, his principal &quot; assistant,&quot; who was formerly a prominentmember of the National Council, that the reasons for the dissolution given inthis decree by no means tell the whole story. They stated that the real reasonwas rather that the Polish Government had recently become seriously concerned about the attitude of the National Council and the strength of the opposition totheir policies which had been developing there. Of the representatives in theCouncil of the four main Polish political Parties all the Peasant Party members,nearly all the Christian Labour Party members, half of the Socialists and someof the National Democrats, as well as a number of non-Party members had gone into opposition to the Polish Government. Matters had been brought to a headby the recent action of two Socialist members who had followed M. Stanczyk andM. Grosfeld, the former Socialist Ministers in M. Mikolajczyk&apos;s Government,in breaking with the section of their Party supporting M. Arciszewski. Thingshad now reached the position where the Polish Government could no longercount with certainty upon a majority in the Council.3. At the end of this month the Polish Government would be obliged tosubmit to the Council their budget for the next quarter. They feared that theymight be subjected to searching enquiries as to the use they were at presentmaking or proposing to make in future of Polish public funds and that this criticism might be pushed to the point of a defeat of the Government&apos;s proposals.In any case criticism of the Polish Government in London within the national council has been intensified recently by the Polish Government&apos;s cavalier treat-men t of the Council. A memorandum submitted to&apos; His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the United States Government by the Polish Government before the Crimea conference was not submitted to the Council for approval despite promises bythe Polish Prime Minister that it would be. Nor was the Council consulted aboutthe strongly critical declarations published by the Polish Government after the crimea Conference. The Council was merely asked to endorse these declarationsafter they had been published.4. The Polish Government, further, had reason to believe that if the present discussions in Moscow were to result in the formation of a new ProvisionalGovernment of National Unity in Poland, a majority of the National council would have openly declared their support of such a Government.5. M. Mikolajczyk thinks that the present intention of the Polish Govern-ment is to appoint a new National Council which would no longer be constitutedon a Party basis. The reason for this was that the Polish Government reliedfor  its  support  upon  three  main  groups :   the   reactionary  Pilsudski-ites12730   [29543]
surrounding the President, the extremist anti-Russian Socialists surroundingthe Prime Minister and the Right-wing group of the National Democrat Party,whose leader is M. Bielecki, and most of the members of the democratic parties were not prepared to sit with these extremist groups in a reconstituted Council.6. To get over this difficulty, M. Mikolajczyk understands that the membersof the new Council would be hand-picked as representing Poles in different areas and from different organisations and walks of life. He commented wryly thatthis method savoured rather of Mussolini&apos;s notions and Lublin&apos;s than those ofParliamentary democracy. In order that the new National Council should appear to represent all Poles abroad, and in particular the Poles in the UnitedStates, a prominent representative of the World League of Poles Abroad wouldbe included. The ultimate aim would be that, if the Polish Government ceased to exist in consequence of the withdrawal of the recognition of the Allies, theCouncil would continue to function as a Polish National Committee claiming to speak in the name of all Poles in exile.7. M. Mikolajczyk added that the Polish Government were, according tohis information, proposing to have a new call-up of men up to 45, which would include the majority of his followers in the old National Council and incidentallyhimself. The Polish Government argue with cynical humour that the future ofthose called up would thus be provided for, since they would be looked after bythe British Government. Those who were not to be called up would, hesupposed, shortly be applying to the Labour Exchanges.A. E.Foreign Office, 29th March, 1945.DECREE.(Translation.)Having regard, firstly, to the necessity of assuring places in the national council of the Polish Republic to representatives of the country and to the widestgroups of society, including tlhe emigration, both in territories liberated from theGerman occupation and elsewhere and, secondly, to the necessity of rendering-more efficient the work of the National Council in the face of the new problems which confront the Nation at the present time,On the basis of Article 14 of the Presidential Decree of the 9th December,1939, relative to the summoning of the National Council (Journal of Laws of thePolish Republic, 1940, No. 8, item 22), and on the proposal of the Presidentof the Council of Ministers,I have decided to dissolve, as from to-day, the present National Council andto appoint as soon as possible a differently composed National Council.W..RACZKIEWICZ,President of the Republic.T. ARCISZEWSKI,President of the Council of Ministers.21st March, 1945.
