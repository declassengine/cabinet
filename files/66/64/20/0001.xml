THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC M1JISTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 220.5th April, 1945.war cabinet.GERMAN BROADCASTING PROPAGANDA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may be interested to see the annexed analysis of recentGerman broadcast propaganda in Russian and English, prepared by Sir RobertBruce-Lockhart.A. E.Foreign Office, 5th April, 1945.ANNEX.During March I have listened in regularly to the German broadcastingpropaganda services to Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. The following analysis,based entirely on my reactions to the salient features, may be of some interest.A. In Russian to the; Russians.I. Political Character of the Service.This service is provided by representatives of the Komitet OsvobozdeniyaNarodoff Rossiya (Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia), whichis the political organ of the army of General Vlassoff. The regular broadcastersare a man and a woman whose names are not given. The woman is by far the better propagandist and has obviously had considerable experience of the kindof street oratory practised by the Russian agitators of the revolutionary period.IT. Nature of the Propaganda.During the period under review, no mention was ever made that this Russianpropaganda was being emitted by the courtesy of the Nazi regime or that thisRussian service advocated a German victory. Germany, in fact, was never men-tioned except in the war news. The bulletins, twice daily for periods of half an hour, consisted of the latest war news (quite short) and of special propagandathemes.The war news was concentrated almost entirely on the Eastern front andwas not wholly inaccurate. The general impression, however, was that theGermans were fighting a successful defensive battle, that the Russian territorialgains were insignificant, and that Russian losses in men and material wereinfinitely greater than Stalin had ever anticipated. The news was slanted in orderto create anxiety and a feeling of impending doom for Russia.The themes, which are treated in detail below, are varied. But their three main objects are (1) to convince Red Army soldiers that Stalin is the enemy of the Russianpeople and of Russia, that they are slaves, and that the only way to stop this murderous war is for the Red Army to turn against theBolshevik Party;(2) to persuade Red Army troops to desert to General Vlassoff&apos;s&quot; army;(3) to cause divisions between the Allies.Of these three themes, the last is the least prominent in the broadcasts.12737   [29604]Copy No.
2The main audience which the propaganda is intended to influence is theRed Army.   But the propaganda itself has a special appeal to Cossacks.III. Examples of Themes.(1) Anti-Stalin -propaganda combined with &quot; end this murderous war&quot; theme.The woman propagandist did a fine piece on this theme. It began with aquestion repeated throughout: &quot;Can we end the war?&quot; A rapid picture isgiven of the war situation with the purpose of showing that on a purely militaryestimate there is no hope of a quick end. The impression created is that no Powercan win and therefore no Power wants to go on with the war. One man and one man only desires to continue the useless slaughter. That man is Stalin. There-fore the war has to go on. Stalin has no other choice. He has sold himself tothe American industrialists and the British bankers. Therefore the russian army and the Russian people have to continue to die like flies for Roosevelt,Churchill and Stalin.It is true that the Russian people are not Stalin, are not, in fact, Bolsheviks.True it is, too, thai; after the war there will be a terrible reckoning between theBolsheviks and the Russian people. But, meanwhile, the war must go on becauseStalin and his colleagues need it for the prolongation of their own existence.Is there therefore no end to the war ? Yes, there is and a quick and effective one. This is to turn the Bolshevik Imperialist war into a civil war. do this, and the war will end in twenty-four hours. Down with the Bolshevik slave-masters.  All power to the Russian people who under Stalin have no power.This is a close imitation of LeniiVs propaganda theme in 1917 : &quot;to turn the Imperialist war into a civil war that is our task.   All power to the Soviets.&quot;(2) Anti-Stalin propaganda with economic theme.The theme opens with an examination of a Red Army prisoner who admitsthat in Russia people have to stand for hours in queues. Then begins the seriesof repetitive questions : &quot; Why are there queues in this terrestrial paradise ofthe U.S.S.R. after a quarter of a century? Why have there always been queues?Why, after all this time, are there no goods? Why was it necessary for theBolsheviks to destroy the whole country? Because only by these illegitimatemethods could they seize and keep the supreme power.This was followed by a. long appeal by the Ataman of the Kuban Cossacksto Red Army Cossacks to desert and join the fight for freedom. Statistics weregiven of the number of Cossack prisoners who had already opted to fight forVlassoff&apos;s Army. The figures were small groups of two or three hundred. Butthe percentage opting for Vlassoff was high always above 90 per cent.(3) Anti-Stalin Propaganda with Political Theme based on the Anniversary ofKiroff&apos;s murder.This opens with some account of Kiroff and the circumstances of his death.Then comes the series of repetitive questions : Who killed Kiroff ? Suspicion iscreated by an account of the judicial proceedings suggesting a sinister mystery.Of course a murderer was found a man called Vasilieff. Has any Russian everknown this man ? Who killed Kiroff? Then, too, there were arrests and deportation-tions. But no names were given-to the public. Who killed Kiroff? This leadsup to the climax. Stalin killed Kiroff. Why? Because he had to wreak hisvengeance on the Ogpu which was becoming too powerful. Therefore join the fight against Bolshevism. Freedom for the Russian people. Freedom for ourselves; above all, freedom for our children.(4) Anti-Stalin Propaganda with a &quot;Split the Allies&quot; Theme.This begins with a picture, more or less accurate, of what the Bolsheviksare doing in Poland, Roumania, Bulgaria, and Finland. The completely &quot; fake &quot;nature of the so-called. Governments in these countries is exposed. They arethe puppets of Stalin who is the complete Fuehrer. The word vozd is used, butquite clearly in the derogatory sense of &quot; Fuehrer.&quot;From this point the propagandist states that the United States and britain are becoming very irritated by Stalin&apos;s methods and, more particularly, by hisone-sided interpretation of the Yalta resolutions. Above all, the British, whohave borne great burdens and made great sacrifices, are angry with Stalin and do not see why they should continue the war merely in order to enable the RussianFuehrer to spread Communism in Europe.   This is the true background to the
recent story of a German peace offer in Stockholm. Germany, of course, made no offer. This peace kite was flown by the British who, because of their mistrustof Stalin, would like to find a way out of the war.B. In English to the British.I. Character of the Service.This service is provided by Englishmen and English-speaking Germans.They include William Joyce who does a review of events of the week on Saturdayevenings.II. Nature of the Propaganda.Like the service to the Russians, the German service consists of war news andof special themes likely to influence an English audience. The war news is not entirely inaccurate, but there is much suppression of all the truth. The generalintention is, by exaggerating the success of German resistance and by belittlingthe Allied gains, to create the impresion that the end of the war is still a very longway off. Every possible use is made of quotations from the British press testi-fying to the fighting qualities of the German soldier.The themes, examples of which are given below, are varied in subject, butconsistent in their main objective. This objective is to create suspicion in Britishminds of the intentions of both the U.S.S.R. and the United States. the suspicion, once created, will lead to war-weariness, for why should Britaincontinue to fight when it is clear to all that Russia will kick her out of europe and the United States will steal her Empire and her markets.III. Examples of Themes.(1) Anti-Russian Propaganda with Theme of the &quot; Bolshevik Bogey.&quot;This form of propaganda begins invariably with a description, more or lessaccurate, of Bolshevik malfeasance in Roumania, Poland, Bulgaria, &amp;c. Thesubstratum of truth is adorned with some particularly choice examples ofBolshevik truculence and savagery; e.g., graphic accounts of Vyshinsky&apos;s threatsto the Roumanian King or of the rape of some unfortunate Roumanian bourgeoiseby a procession of Red soldiers. Special care is taken to show how the Britishand American members of the Control Commissions are snubbed and humiliatedon every occasion. Attention is also paid to the muzzling of the British and american press, and the whole propaganda effort is directed to proving to thelistener that he is not being told the truth by his own Government. The listeneris then asked the following question : &quot;If the Bolsheviks are already behavingso outrageously in the liberated countries at a moment when the German armiesare effectively resisting them, what do you suppose will happen if the german armies are defeated? Indeed, it suits Mr. Churchill very well that you shouldnot know how M. Vyshinsky behaves, because the truth might be very awdvwardfor Mr. Churchill. For he has sold out to Stalin, and in selling out he hassold millions of Europeans into Bolshevik slavery. You will say that Roumaniawas an enemy. But what of Poland? What of Czechoslovakia&quot;? Dr. Benes has just arrived in Moscow. He must be unhappy, but clearly, being not withouta low cunning, he has learnt something from the experience of other allies ofEngland. The lesson is that, Britain&apos;s Churchiirs pledges are worthless. Inselling himself to Stalin, Benes has, therefore, had to try other methods. Theywill not be more successful than those of the Poles, but from his point of view he can hardly be blamed.&quot;(2) Anti-Russian Propaganda with its theme intended to influence those easy-going English who believe that Russia is no longer dangerous because sheis no longer Communist.This theme was the result of the visit of the British Parliamentary delegation to Russia. After a few quotations from the sayings of such Russian experts as commander King-Hall and Colonel Walter Elliot, the broadcast emphasised theidiocy of the type of Englishman who goes to Russia for a week or two, poses onhis return as an expert and is, of course, accepted as such by the lazy British publicbecause he tells them what they want to hear; namely, that there is no need for anxiety, that the U.S.S.R. is no longer Communist, and that it is no longerinterested in the sovietisation of Europe or of any other continent.
This idiocy, it is true, proves one thing : obviously it is still necessary to assure the British public that Communism is dead because the British publicinstinctively mistrusts Communism. In every other respect, however, this com-placency is crazy. With Bolshevik methods nothing is easier than for a minorityto seize power.&quot; It always has been a minority that has seized power. TakeRoumania as the most recent example. The democrats of yesterday have now become the &quot; Fascist beasts.&quot; Now here is King-Hall ready to perjure himselfby assuring the British public: &quot; it can&apos;t happen here.&quot; He ignores what hasalways happened to those who have tried to sup with the Bolshevik devil. Doeshe not remember Lenin&apos;s prophecy : &quot; The first world war (1914-18) will establishCommunism in Russia; the second world war will establish Communism inEurope, and the third world war will establish Communism throught the world.&quot;This form of appeasement is the refuge of those politicians who prefer consolationto truth.(3) Anti-Russian Propaganda on the theme of Russia&apos;s menace to British lifeinterests.This began with an account of Russians denunciation of her treaty of friendship with Turkey. Of course it is quite clear to any intelligent personwhat this means. Russia wants the control of the Dardanelles and of theEastern Mediterranean. What the British public does not know is that britain has already surrendered this vantage point. It was conceded in the secretresolutions at Yalta. When Russia gets her way, it will not be long before sheis mistress of all the Mediterranean. What is Britain fighting for1? Here is another of her life-lines gone.(4) Anti-American Propaganda with economic theme.This was an effective comment on the suggested cut in the meat ration. Itbegan with the suggestion that Britain, who had fought for five and. a half years,would have to face something new fighting plus famine. The United states had made this most drastic cut 87 per cent. in her meat supplies to Britain onthe alleged ground that not enough shipping was available. Of course, the state-ment is entirely untrue. Mr. Kaiser is still very active. The ships are being produced, but they are being kept for the future for the day when, the fightingwar over, the economic war will begin and the American ships will be used to drive the British merchant navy off the seas to keep it off the seas, in fact,because it has already had immense losses and will have to be rebuilt.(5) Anti-British Government Propaganda as exemplified by the Treatment of theForeign Secretary&apos;s Speech in Glasgow.The German propagandist seized on three points : (i) Eden emphasised that in the British conduct of foreign affairs the over-riding principle was the responsibility of the Executive to Parliament. This,said the German voice, is just not true. By the Churchill Government parliament is not only not consulted; it is not even kept informed. It has not been told the truth of what happened at Yalta.(ii) Eden said that the British have fought two great world wars to preventEurope falling under the domination of one Power.This, again, said the German voice, is untrue, at least as far as this waris concerned, for nobody can pretend that Germany&apos;s just claim to Danzig wasa claim to dominate Europe. It would have been a tiny fraction of what theUS.S.R. has already done to dominate Europe. If Germany, who was holdingRussia in check, were to be destroyed, then Europe would indeed be dominatedmilitarily by one Power and to an unprecedented extent. But the Power wouldnot be Britain, who was weakening herself daily solely in order to make moscow and Washington stronger.(iii) Finally. Eden said that Britain no longer ruled the seven seas because this was now impossible with the advent of the powerful air arm. This maybe true as far as Britain is concerned, but it is open to doubt whether anotherPower cannot rule the seven seas. If the United States maintains as sheprobably will-the biggest navy and the biggest air force, the task will be easy.The speech shows clearly Bri.tain&apos;s inability to face the future, bereft as sheis of her political power, of her naval supremacy, and of all her overseas markets.(Signed) R. H. BRUCE LOCKHART.2&amp;th March, 1945.
