THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT - J O ^Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 246.13th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.EMPIRE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES : LORD RE I TITSMISSION.(Previous reference : W.M. (44) 154th Conclusions, Minute 3.)Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Commonwealth Communications Council in June 1944 recommended(in the Anzac plan) that Cable and Wireless, Ltd. should be superseded by a seriesof public utility corporations in the United Kingdom, each of the Dominions andIndia, and that these corporations should be linked together by an exchange ofshareholding and with the C.C.C. functioning as a co-ordinating and advisory body.2. The United Kingdom Government appointed* a Ministerial committee under my Chairmanship to consider these recommendations which in general hadbeen accepted by the Dominions and India.3. The War Cabinet on the 22nd November, 1944,t considered a Report onbehalf of my Committee (W.P. (44) 657). The War Cabinet decided that theAnzac plan should be rejected, but came to no decision as to the recommendation that a decision should be taken in principle that Cable and Wireless, Ltd. shouldbe placed on a public utility footing. They directed that a Mission should visit the Dominions, India and Southern Rhodesia to explain why the Anzac scheme could not be accepted, and to explore various alternatives including (if a change was necessary), a suggestion for a public utility organisation providing for greater integration of policy and control than that envisaged under the Anzacscheme.4. Lord Reith has visited the Governments of the Dominions, India and southern Rhodesia and reported to me. The following are the essential features of his report, which is annexed hereto (Annex B) : (i) He found, except in Canada (who are not closely concerned), a general feeling of dissatisfaction with the present commercial set-up. Therewas a general desire for the objectives of the Anzac scheme providingfor greater local autonomy and the elimination of the control by a london-based corporation. There was a general desire to substitute a public utility for the profit motive. It was clear that if the objectives cannot be achieved by agreement, some Dominions may break away from the present system,(ii) On the other hand, he found a great measure of goodwill and desire toco-operate, and the Australian Government, who were visited first,agreed to subscribe to an understanding (referred to as the &quot; Canberraproposals &quot;) which provides, in place of the loose linkage of the C.C.C.,for an incorporated Central Body with definitive and authoritativepov/ers over policy and finance. A summary of these proposals is setout in Annex 4 to Lord Reithds report at pp. 16-12.The Canberra proposals were supported by New Zealand.Southern Rhodesia and India (indeed the first tAvo were prepared togo further in the direction of a single Empire corporation). On theother hand, South Africa and Canada, whilstaccepting the objectives* W.M. (44) 79th Conclusions, Item 3. f W.M. (44) 154th Conclusions Item 3[29700]Copy No,- 1i t
and machinery set out in the Canberra proposals, were unwilling to subscribe to them except on a voluntary and consultative basis,(iii) The Dominions have expressed the desire for the holding of an EmpireTelecommunications Conference in London, with a view to working out a solution on public utility lines for the operation of Empire Tele-communication services in the light of the results of Lord Reith.&apos;mission.5. My colleagues and I have fully considered Lord Reith&apos;s report and,except for the Lord Privy Seal,* we consider that an organisation on publicutility lines offers the best hope of providing the efficient and resilient systemof Commonwealth telecommunications which post-war conditions and, inparticular, competition from foreign interests, will demand. In our view matterscannot be allowed to stand where they are, and unless a change of system ismade the difficulties experienced in the past.will increase. We are convincedthat although the Canberra proposals must be looked at subject to the qualifica-tions of South Africa and Canada, they represent the best that can be achieved at the present time, and we think there is good, reason to hope that these twocountries will, in view of their assurances, in practice conform to the proposals,and that the required degree of integration, which was lacking in the originalAnzac proposals, will therefore be obtained.6. Lord Reith in paragraph 13 of his report suggests that the functionsof the Central Body might be reinforced by assigning to it the ownership and operation of what are referred to as &quot; oceanic assets.&quot; By this is meant tele-communication assets which, are extra-territorial to the United Kingdom, theDominions, India and Southern Rhodesia, e.g., submarine cables (as distinct fromcable heads) and possibly wireless relay stations in the Colonies. This proposal,while in many ways attractive, will require detailed examination, e.g., from thepoint of view of the issues raised in relation to the Colonies, but my colleagues and I agree that it should be considered at the suggested conference.7. Apart from questions affecting the future organisation of the Common-wealth telecommunications services, a conference is required in order to determineCommonwealth policy for the purpose of pending discussions with the UnitedStates.8.   The War Cabinet is invited (i) to endorse our approval of the recommendations in Lord Reith&apos;s report,in particular (a) that the Commonwealth Telecommunications system, subject to asatisfactory outcome of the proposed conference, should beplaced on a public utility footing on the lines of the Canberraproposals, as qualified by South Africa, and Canada;(b) that a Commonwealth Telecommunications conference at a high level should be convened in London with a view to the implementation of Lord Reith/s recommendations and thepreparation of a detailed plan;(c) that the conference should explore the proposal that &quot;oceanicassets &apos;&apos; should be owned and operated by the Central Body;(d) that the conference should consider the Commonwealth Tele-communications policy towards the United States.(ii) to authorise me in consultation with the other Ministers concerned tomake the necessary arrangements.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,13th April, 1945.* The Lord Privy Seal has furnished a statement of his views and asked for them to be circulated as an annex.   (Annex A.)
ANNEX &quot;A.&quot;EMPIRE TELECOMMUNICATIONS.Minority Report by Lord Privy Seal.LORD REITH has not made out a case for the dissolution of Cable and wireless.Even if he could show that the Dominions are united in favour of his project,it should be rejected. For the Central Body which he proposes has neither enoughauthority nor power. And the inevitable result would be interference resulting in frustrated management, friction, and ultimately failure to compete with thewell organised and thoroughly integrated American concerns.Lord Reith himself adequately described the importance of this CentralAuthority when he told the E.T.S. Committee that the position could be illustrated by describing a Board of Directors in session. Some of those present wouldintimate that they ought not to be in attendance. But since they found themselvesin the company of others, then acting altogether, they should get on with thebusiness.It is certain that such an organisation could never provide the necessaryvigorous direction.But in any event the conception of a Central Authority as now put forward by Lord Reith is not supported by all the Dominions.The New Zealand Government declared to Lord Reith in favour of a plangiving the Central Body complete and absolute power. This plan found favourboth with India and Southern Rhodesia.Field-Marshal Smuts, it is true, felt himself unable, owing to the exigencies of his political situation, to accept the degree of control suggested byNew Zealand. But Lord Reith says in his Report that, but for the originalrecommendations of the Commonwealth Communications Council, the questionof taking over telecommunications assets might never have arisen in South Africaat all. And South African satisfaction with Cable and Wireless set-up in 1942is shown by a letter written to the Dominions Secretary by the South AfricanHigh Commissioner stating that his Government desire to do their utmost tomaintain the spirit and practice of the Empire policy.The Canadians are in similar case. Lord Reith says that in Canada &quot; therewas no great inclination to take over, except to conform with a Commonwealthpattern.&quot;Now there are other substantial reasons for rejecting the proposal for the dissolution of Cable and Wireless.Conditions have changed during this war. The cable system is now more valuable than the wireless circuits, which heretofore have been looked on as amenacing challenge to the Cable companies. Speed of transmission by cable hasbeen greatly increased and costs substantially reduced. And these developmentswill be speeded up by the recent application to cable transmission of the cli-electricinsulator called polythene which is expected to double the carrying capacity ofloaded cables and to reduce costs of transmission by 25 per cent. Cables have become more valuable to Cable and Wireless.It has been said that the retention of Cable and Wireless in its present formwould result in Australia breaking away altogether. But the Australians possessno cables. If they tried to handle their telecommunications traffic on a wirelessbasis only, they would be knocked out by the competition of Cable and Wireless,who have many alternative cable routes to Australia. Nor could the Australianshope to compete with the penny-a-word press rate which Cable and Wirelessoperate.It is in fact most unlikely that the Australian Government would take acourse so injurious to the Commonwealths interests. But even were they to doso, they are no longer in a position to threaten the commercial stability ofCable and Wireless.American dislike of Cable and Wireless is no longer a reason for dissolvingthe Company. For recently this hostility has abated. The Americans have ceased to bring pressure to bear on us in telecommunications matters. Manvformer difficulties have been resolved. And there is every reason to hope theywill not recur.
Lord Reith&apos;s proposals should be abandoned, and the existing structure ofCable and Wireless should be maintained. In addition there should be introduced a system of pooled receipts with the Dominions on the basis of traffic handled.By this means local management and control would be assured to the Dominioncompanies, and at the same time the Dominions would be given the necessaryincentive to direct all their business over the Cable and Wireless system.Under such circumstances, and given freedom from unnecessary outside inter-ference, Cable and Wireless should be able to maintain and increase both its financial strength and earning powers.It is in any case desirable before further decisions are taken that the directors of Cable and Wireless should be consulted, and that they should beinvited to give assurances of the financial stability of their Company in the future.B.Gwydyr House, S.W.1,13th April, 1945.

The Right Honourable Sir John Anderson,G.C.B., G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., LL.D., M.P.,Chancellor of the ExchequerCOMMONWEALTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS.BY War Cabinet decision of 22.11.45 you asked me to visit the Governmentsof the Dominions and India to discuss the organisation of the Commonwealthtelecommunications services. The First Lord released me from Admiralty and here is the result.2. Mission party.The accompanying party is given in Annex 1 a splendid team. the outstanding qualities of the three seniors are of common knowledge; their contribution was in accordance therewith. The party is greatly indebted toMr. Lewis for his efficient handling of its business affairs.&apos;3. Itinerary.(1) Particulars are given in Annex 2. 6 capitals, 44,700 miles, 235 hoursflying, 52 days (to a day as scheduled before departure).(2) It was desirable to go first to Australia instead of on a direct east- orwest-about route. This put 13,000 miles and a week on the journey, involved fourcrossings of the Equator and three of the Atlantic.(3) It was an epic performance, reflecting great credit on the captain andcrew of the Liberator &quot; Commando.&quot; the ground organisation and meteorologicalservices, and the R.A.F. generally. Nothing like it had been done before; variousrecords were established.4. Reception.(1) The delay (as other Governments regarded it) in U.IC. decision, and,when it came, the rejection of the Anzac plan, together with the announcement ofan obviously high-calibred mission, had given rise, in varying combination anddegree, to surmise, apprehension, even resentment.(2) Such sentiments did not, even initially, interfere with the courtesy ofwelcome; and, being quickly dispelled, were succeeded in each country by an extreme cordiality and an almost embarrassing determination to show honourin hospitality and attention of every sort to their visitors; and, more significant,to understand and meet, as far as possible, the visitors&apos; points of view.(3) To Viceroy, Governors-General, Governors, High Commissioners, theR.A.F., and the U.S.A.A.F. the party is very grateful for hospitality and otherattentions, and for the care of its vehicle.(4) A party of this sort cannot travel and make such contacts without beingrecipients of interesting and possibly important comment; nor without formingsome conclusions on Commonwealth and Empire affairs not, however, relevant to this Report.5. Objectives.These were : (1) To explain rejection of Anzac plan recommended by commonwealth communities Council.(2) To explore alternatives, including (a) Continuance of Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. system, possibly modified.(b) An Empire corporation scheme, or something like it, on publicutility lines.(3) To make clear that the Dominions and India should carry their dueproportion of obligations in any new set-up.6. Anzac plan.This involved Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. and associated companies in theDominions and India being superseded by public utility corporations linkedby exchange of stock, the Commonwealth Communications Council acting asco-ordinating authority.   The plan is given in Annex 3.T29503] B 2
7. U.K. attitude to Anzac plan.(A) Examination of Anzac was carried out by the E.T.S. Official Committee.They concluded that it was impracticable and did not solve the problems. it did not provide for the necessary unity and control of policy, nor for the sharingof financial responsibility. The Committee, however, felt there was a good case for changing Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. and associated companies to public utilitycorporations, provided adequate arrangements were made for central co-ordination and control. They regarded a single Empire corporation as muchsuperior to Anzac.(2) Their first report (E.T.S. (44) 12) was considered by the ministerial committee and referred to the War Cabinet.(3) War Cabinet ((44) 154th Conclusions), though rejecting Anzac, came to no definite conclusion except that someone should visit the Dominions andIndia.8. Procedure.(1) In each capital, after apologies for delay, the ILK. Governmentsobjections to Anzac were stated and explained. The vital importance of tele-communications was urged; the system must always be considered as a whole.The need for co-ordination between cables and wireless was emphasised; cableswere not obsolete nor limited in use to strategic or stand-by purposes; both were necessary and were supplementary to each other; they must not be regarded ascompetitive (and Anzac leaves them so); an efficient telecommunications systemcannot be secured without a high measure of central co-ordination and controlof policy and finance.(2) In general, objections to Anzac were eventually appreciated and accepted. So were the objectives wholeheartedly on organic and technical grounds, but with varying qualms and reservations on the political issues involved.(3) Enquiries were then made as to the possibility of retention of cable and Wireless Ltd. modified in some way. Any such idea was, with one exception, incontinently dismissed. This is not necessarily a reflection on cable and Wireless Ltd. The objections to a London owned and based company,trading for profit, and dominating the Commonwealth scene, are real andunshakable. There is genuine doubt as to its ability to meet the increasingconflict of commercial and public service demands, particularly in view of themore or less unilateral actions and prospective actions of some of the othercountries. There is a desire and mind for local ownership and control, andmost Governments indicated that they were determined to secure this whatever the U.K. Government might do or not do though they were led to an apprecia-tion of the great difficulties which might be met. In Australia and New zealand the desire and mind are now strong. (In the latter they might wish to retain the overseas wireless communications in Post Office operation.) In India there is theideological Indianisation factor. In Southern Rhodesia they are definitelytending towards public ownership. In South Africa taking over telecommunications-tion assets might not have arisen but for the recommendation of the C.C.C.; itis not yet a political issue though some public utilities are owned by the State. InCanada the matter is not a political issue; there was no great inclination to takeover except to conform with a Commonwealth pattern.(4) The chief objectives of Anzac were then reviewed.(i) Elimination of dominating position of Cable and Wireless Ltd.(ii) Substitution of public utility for commercial motive,(iii) Recognition of Dominion sovereign rights.It was made clear that the mission understood their significance and the conviction with which they were held.(5) Anzac had also, however, envisaged some central co-ordination. Muchmore was needed than therein visualised, and a radically different kind of body todo it. This might be secured, it was suggested, by a willing pooling of sovereignrights which was no surrender of or prejudice to them.(6) Before passing to consideration of alternatives which would give whatwas required, it was explained that the mission was not charged by the U.K.Government to try to secure assent to some particular&apos; scheme single Empirecorporation or other. It was to be a case of exploration and discussion with governments.(7) So in Australia the Canberra proposals were, in fearful travail,produced.   It was the nearest they could be brought to the single Empire
corporation, the greater efficiency of which they admit, and, but for political considerations, would have gone nearer still.(8) And in all the other countries the above procedure was religiouslyfollowed. Accounts of the processes of evolution of the Canberra proposals were added, and comments and questions thereon invited.(9) Southern Rhodesia, New Zealand, and even India would in some respectsgo further than the Canberra proposals. South Africa and Canada, while fullyagreeing their practical desirability and the efficiency they would ensure, found the form of their presentation politically impossible of acceptance. But they gaveemphatic assurance that, on a voluntary as distinct from a statutory or any kindof obligatory basis, they would co-operate as fully as others.(10) A summary of particular points emphasised in each country is given inparagraph 10; the Prime Ministers&apos; letters in Annex 5; notes of discussions in annex 6.9. Canberra proposals.(1) These are given in Annex 4. The document is described as &quot; a proposed scheme for the extension of the Anzac plan.&quot; This was a -welcomed concession toAustralian susceptibilities. In fact the proposals go far beyond anythingconceived or conceivable under Anzac.(2) The proposals give the following main provisions to achieve centralco-ordination and control of policy (and a large measure in the execution of it)and sharing of financial responsibility : (i) An incorporated central body with an independent chairman and representatives of each Government,(ii) Local corporations under a statutory obligation to carry out directivesof central body for the Commonwealth system.(iii) Central body to be charged with responsibilities such as-:  (a) Formulation and direction of joint telecommunications policy of governments.(b) Co-ordinated development   of  cable  and   wireless  systems  of commonwealth.(c) Approval of all extensions and alterations to system.Id) Conduct   of   negotiations   with   foreign   telecommunicationsinterests(e) In projects involving capital expenditure apportionment amonglocal corporations.(/) Assessment  of  proportions  to  be  contributed   towards  cablemaintenance.(g) Advice to Governments on  matters affecting defence, foreign relations, &amp;c.(A) Conduct and co-ordination of research.(i) Various personnel matters.(iv) To achieve co-ordinated development of the system as a whole, pooling of net receipts (after deduction of working expenses), each localcorporation submitting an annual budget to central body for scrutinyand comment; apportionment of pool by central body,(v) Central body would appoint a director-general in executive control of whole organisation, with senior officials whose functional authority would run throughout system,(vi) Decisions of central body on matters of governmental policy would not take effect without unanimity. Where unanimity could not beobtained on such a matter it would be referred by chairman to governments with a report and recommendation.(3) Local corporations survive but are shadows of their Anzac selves. Forthe vague linkage of the C.C.C., there is an incorporated central body withextensive, definite powers binding on them all. There is joint financial responsi-bility in capital obligations and in pooling and apportionment of net revenues.(4) The way of escape for any Government, provided by the clause enjoininga stay of execution (if demanded) when a decision is not unanimous, is ofparticular interest in view of South African and Canadian disinclination to subscribe to a central body except on a voluntary, consultative basis.    The
difference in effect between the Canberra proposals and the conception of sucha consultative body may not be great.10. Particularities and Prime Ministers&apos; letters.(1) Australia:(i) Present set-up unpopular.(ii) Determined to nationalise public services generally and this one in particular.(iii) Will do so whether or not integrated with a Commonwealthsystem.(iv) Was persuaded to agree to central control in Canberra proposals,fv) Admits greater efficiency of a single Empire corporation schemeand thinks it may come, though cannot be accepted now becauseof politics,(vi) Wants immediate London conference.Prime Ministers letter in Annex 5 (A).(2) New Zealand:(i) Anzac objectives desired,(ii) Canberra proposals accepted.(iii) Would go further towards a single Empire corporation and wantsthis considered.(iv) Suggests central body hold all Commonwealth assets.(v) Suggests equitable division of capital costs of acquiring assets,(vi) Wants full budgetary control of local corporations,(vii) Wants immediate London conference.Prime Ministers letter in Annex 5 (B).(3) India:(i) Anzac objectives desired.(ii) Canberra proposals accepted.(iii)- Agrees that New Zealand further proposals should be discussed.(iv) Minor reservations, e.g., as to form of local body.(v) Urges all overseas telephone services to be included.(vi) Suggests limitation of representation on central body by somecriterion of stake.(vii) Wants immediate London conference.Government letter in Annex 5 (C).(4) Southern Rhodesia:(i) Anzac objectives desired.(ii) Canberra proposals accepted.(ni) Would go considerably further in central control, further eventhan New Zealand,(iv) Would really accept a single Empire corporation.(v) Has local problems about regionalisation in Central Africa.(vi) Asked if she would have same status as others,(vii) Wants immediate London conference.Prime Minister&apos;s letter in Annex 5 (D).(5) South Africa:(i) Anzac objectives desired.(ii) Was about to reject some Anzac features as too binding.(iii) Declines to accept any statutory obligation to or obligatory linkagewith a central body.(iv) Promises however fullest co-operation and points to past loyalty,(v)- Accepts Canberra proposals modified to a consultative basis.(vi) Accepts central body and executive staff,(vii) Wants immediate London conference.Prime Ministers letter in Annex 5 (E).
(6) Canada:(i) Less interested than others, and no complaints with present set-up.(ii) Assent to Anzac half-hearted and had reservations to make.(iii) Is linked with U.S.A. and less dependent on Commonwealthsystem.(iv) Would not wish to do anything that might prejudice relationswith TJ.S.A.(v) Is at least as much interested in an international as in a Common-wealth system and is somewhat apprehensive of effect of an empire bloc on U.S.A.(vi) Would, however, conform as far as possible.(vii) Agreed therefore to adopt same line as South Africa. -(viii) Wants immediate London conference.Prime Minister&apos;s letter in Annex 5 (F).(7) Opportunity was given in several Colonial territories for an expression of opinion by Governors and senior officials on telecommunications organisation.These can be given when relevant. &apos; They have obviously a bearing onregionalisation.11. Notes of discussions.These, which show the individuals participating and the atmosphere, aregiven in Annex 6 (A) to (F).12. Conclusions.(1) Dissatisfactions with the existing set-up are widespread and real. Theycannot with impunity be ignored. This was the view of the U.K. Governmentprior to the mission. And hence the mission. There was much variety of opinionbefore the mission started as to whether it would accomplish anything, or any-thing better than Anzac. It was even feared it might disrupt such little co-ordina-tion as was provided by the C.C.C. or as visualised in Anzac.(2) The extent of the central co-ordination and control agreed to by Australiawas surprising and satisfactory.   It seemed to give what is required.(3) Acceptance of the Canberra proposals by New Zealand, India, and southern Rhodesia and each of them prepared to go further- was also satis-factory. If South Africa and Canada had accepted them too, the way of recom-mendation would have been clear.(4) It has now to be decided to what extent the Canberra proposals areprejudiced by the South African and Canadian general qualification. The attitude and decision are crucial.(5) Extremes of view are possible. At one extreme it might be held thatthe central body would be as ineffective as the C.C.C. under Anzac. At the other,that, if words mean anything, all the arguments which led to the Canberra paper,all the objectives and all the principles therein, are accepted and will be observed,and that the qualification in practice will amount to difference of form and not of substance.(6) If the former view obtain it is difficult to see what can be done probablynothing, things being left as they are, despite all the dissatisfactions and brewing-troubles.   It seems wrong even to contemplate such a course.(7) Should it not be possible, even with the South African and Canadianqualification, in practice to get all that is required by way of central co-ordination and control? Admittedly faith, courage and determination are implicit in sucha decision, but the issues at stake demand them.13. Further conclusion on &quot; Oceanic assets.&quot;(1) As suggestions stand now, Cable and Wireless Ltd. would be turnedinto a U.K. corporation. Under the central body there would be several corpora-tions, one of which would own assets five times greater in value than all the otherstogether. Moreover, the central body would be overshadowed by the U.K. cor-poration; and there would be difficulty in deciding where the most expert officials should operate.(2) Consideration of such difficulties and the desirability of strengthening the foundations of the central body, leads to a further proposal namely that&quot;Oceanic assets,&quot; i.e., assets not situated in UK., Dominions, or India should
pass to.the central body. The UK. holding would then be on a par with that ofthe other corporations only assets situated in U.K.(3) If approved, the idea would have to be notified to Dominions and india for discussion at the conference.(4) There are four chief advantages : (i) Above anomalies and difficulties would be eliminated.(ii) Dominions would have control over the system on which they dependwithout compromise to sovereign rights.(iii) Sphere of Commonwealth co-operation would be extended.(iv) Authority and functions of central body would be immediately enlarged.by its having much more to do in positive, executive responsibility.And the effect of this would be cumulative, tending to further enhance-ment of its position.14. Recommendations.I recommend United Kingdom Government should :  (1) Eecognise Canberra proposals as a practicable basis for reorganisation of the services, even when adjusted to meet South African and Canadian require-ments, and even if their acceptance by other Governments be similarly conditioned.(2) Assume, but subject as below, that South African and Canadianassurances of full co-operation with central body on a voluntary and consultativebasis will prove as effective as if it had been obligatory and directive; and thatthis would apply if other countries, all or any, similarly reduced their acceptancebut with equal assurance of co-operation.(3) Agree to immediate summoning on ministerial level of a CommonwealthTelecommunications Conference in London, to review results of this mission, tomake such modifications as are necessary to Canberra proposals, and to evolvea modus-operandi for the future, based on Canberra principles, including estab-lishment of an incorporated central body. Conference to consider the Common-wealth policy on telecommunications towards US.A.; representatives of Com-panies concerned to be available for consultation and negotiation as required.(4) Subject to the above being satisfactorily accomplished, and in such wiseas to give a reasonable assurance of practicability and implementation, agree topurchase, with such assistance as may be forthcoming from other Governments,the assets of Cable and Wireless Ltd. and to facilitate purchase by Dominionsand India of their local assets now owned, partly or wholly, by Cable and wireless Ltd.(5) Agree to the exploration at the Conference of the central body assumingresponsibility, directly or indirectly, for ownership, maintenance, and operationof the assets now held by Cable and Wireless, Ltd., outside the United Kingdom,Dominions, and India, in addition to those responsibilities visualised for it inthe Canberra proposals.(6) In this event agree to establish a United Kingdom corporation limitedto ownership, maintenance and operation of such assets of Cable and WirelessLtd. as are physically situated in the United Kingdom.(Signed) J.

Settlement and Carrying Out of Provisions.A Conference shall be held in London at an early date for the purpose ofworking out a full scheme embodying the foregoing principles, including the determination of the regions of each of the local Corporations.Canberra, A.C.T.,6th February, 1945.ANNEX 5A.Letter from Australian Prime       ister.   6.2.45.As a result of our discussion on Empire telecommunications in the lastweek, it is a great pleasure to us that we have been able to agree a joint documentfor submission respectively to the United Kingdom and Australian Governments,subject, in my case, to the concurrence of the Governments in the other Dominionsand India.It is our understanding that I will do my best to secure acceptance of theplan contained in this document by the Australian Government, and you will do the same with the United Kingdom Government.As was made clear in London in May, 1944, Australia accepted in principle the Anzac Plan, and we are ready, and always have been ready, to adhere tothat plan, but I can fully accept your view that a single Empire corporationscheme would as a machine give more efficiency in operation, and it well maybe that through experience, and not lengthy experience, the Partner governments may find it desirable to move towards that conception.   In any case, I consider
that the Anzac Plan has been strengthened by what we have now agreed, andI hope all the other partners in the plan will join us in that view.In my opinion, and I hope yours, we have achieved something which ismemorable and significant in that it gives a greater degree of Empire unitythan has yet been achieved in this, or for the matter of that, any other comparablefield.ANNEX 5B.Letter from New Zealand Prime Minister.   12.2.45.Consideration has been given to the proposals for the re-organisation of thetele-communications system of the Commonwealth and Empire, contained inthe joint document agreed at Canberra for the extension of the Anzac Plan.The various aspects of the single Empire Corporation Scheme, with or withoutthe Local Corporations having greater or lesser powers,&apos; to which the PrimeMinister of Australia referred in his letter to you, have also been discussed with you and your colleagues. I regard the scheme of organisation agreed in thejoint document at Canberra as an improvement upon the original Anzac Plansubmitted by the representatives of the Australian and New Zealand governments to the Tele-Communications Conference held in London in May of last year.While I am prepared, subject to the suggestions for amendment made in para-graphs 2 to 4 inclusive and any comments made by the Governments of otherDominions, India and the United Kingdom, to recommend its acceptance by theNew Zealand Government as an improvement on the Anzac Plan, I have cometo the conclusion, on further and more detailed examination of the whole position,that an alternative scheme, an outline of which is given in paragraph 5, may prove even more acceptable to Commonwealth Governments.2. In my view it is fundamental to the success of a joint enterprise of thekind we are discussing that each of the Partner Governments should share inequitable proportions the initial capital expenditure involved. I consider thatthe costs which will arise under the scheme outlined in the joint document agreed at Canberra should be met upon this basis, notwithstanding that it may possiblyinvolve expenditure by the Dominions and India greater than that originally contemplated. It should be a matter of no undue difficulty to settle an equitablebasis of contribution, and this question would, I consider, be a suitable one toinclude for discussion at the Conference to be held later this year in Londonand to which reference is made in paragraph 9 of the joint document agreed at Canberra.3. With respect to the provisions concerning finance which appear in para-graph 7 of the joint document, I consider that each of the Partner governments should agree that the Local Corporations shall submit their annual budgets toC.B. on which the Partner Governments will each be equally represented forapproval rather than merely for comment. The general interests of the LocalCorporations vis-a-vis each other, and in relation to C.B., are closely interlinked,and approval by C.B. of the budgets of Local Corporations seems necessary.4. There are certain amendments of a minor character which we agreed it isdesirable to make to the text of the joint document, and these are indicated in the annex to this letter.5. The alternative to the Canberra proposals, I suggest, is a Central BritishCommonwealth Tele-Communications Organisation set up to own and control allassets acquired from Cable and Wireless Limited, and any further equipmentnecessary for the effective operation of tele-communications from any BritishEmpire or Commonwealth area. The capital required for this central organisa-tion would be subscribed on an agreed and equitable basis by all PartnerGovernments. Attached to the central organisation would be subsidiary organisa-tions which would act for the central organisation and operate the services in thearea controlled by each of the Partner Governments. The central organisation would be managed by a Central Board on which all of the Partner governments would have equal representation.   This proposal is designed to ensure : (a) One central Empire and Commonwealth Organisation.(b) Equal representation of the United Kingdom, the Dominions, India, andthe Colonies on the Board of the central organisation.
(c) Subscription by all the Partner Governments of necessary capital on an agreed and equitable basis.(d) Determination of general policy by the Board of the central organisation.(e) Management and operation in accordance with the policy determined bythe Central Board. This will be carried out in each area where theservice operates, by subsidiary organisations, the nature of which willbe a subject for consideration, to be established by the respectivePartner Governments.Such a scheme of organisation would be acceptable to New Zealand and otherPartner Governments may well agree, on further examination of the whole problem, that it would be the best for the purpose. I would urge that this proposalbe considered at the Conference to be held in London later this year.6. I should like to say, in conclusion, that the discussions between our repre-sentatives have been most valuable and I look, with you, to the early realisation ofa scheme which will secure the orderly and co-ordinated development, on anadequate basis, of the tele-communications facilities which serve the Common-wealth and Empire.Annex to Letter from New Zealand Prime Minister.Amendments to Joint Document Agreed at Canberra on 7th February between united Kingdom, and Australian Representatives.Paragraph 4 (c) (v) :After &quot; territory of &quot; interpolate &quot; one, or.&quot;Paragraph 4 (c) (x) :Add the words &quot; including the C.B.&quot;Paragraph 4 (c) :Add a new sub-paragraph :  &quot; (xi) General standard of welfare, conditions, pension schemes, andother general staffing conditions would be on a basis to be approvedby C.B.&quot;Paragraph 6 (d) :For &quot; staff &quot; substitute &quot; citizens.&quot;ANNEX 5C.Letter from Government of India.   21.2.45.I am directed to refer to the discussions which have taken place betweenyourself and the members of your mission and the representatives of the Govern-ment of India, on the subject of the re-organisation of the Telecommunicationssystems of the British Commonwealth and Empire.2. In this connection, it is recalled that the Commonwealth CommunicationsCouncil at its meeting held in London in 1944 recommended for the acceptance ofthe Governments a plan for a new basis of organisation. This plan has beenaccepted in principle by India and by most of the Dominion Governments. InDecember 1944, the Government of India received intimation from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that the War Cabinet had considered the proposals for the re-organisation of British Commonwealth Telecommunications system put forward by the Commonwealth Communications Council, and while fully appreciating thereasons why a change in the present organisation was suggested, they sawconsiderable practical difficulties in accepting those proposals. They agreed that every endeavour should be made to reach a solution of the problem quickly, butas the matter hardly lent itself to discussion by exchange of correspondence, they decided to send an emissary of the highest standing to visit each of the Dominions,India and Southern Rhodesia, to explain fully their views as to the Council&apos;scheme and to discuss with those Governments alternative possibilities. Yourvisit to this country has followed on this decision.
3. You have visited the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion ofNew Zealand and have had discussions with the Governments of those Dominions.The Government of India have received from the Prime Ministers of the twoDominions telegrams communicating the results of their discussions with you.The original scheme suggested by the Commonwealth Communications Council,the expanded scheme now agreed to between yourself and the Government of theCommonwealth of Australia, and the alternative scheme suggested by the Govern-ment of New Zealand have been the subjects of discussion between your mission and the representatives of the Government of India.4. The Government of India note that the Report by the commonwealth communities Council forecast that if its suggested re-organisation schemawere adopted in principle by all partner Governments, the powers and duties of the  Commonwealth Communications Council would have to be revised to meet thenew conditions. The scheme tentatively agreed to by you and the Governmentof the Commonwealth of Australia specifies the powers and duties of the newCentral Body on the assumption that the multi-corporation scheme envisaged inthe plan suggested by the Commonwealth Communications Council is adopted byall Governments, including the Government of the United Kingdom. TheGovernment of India have examined this scheme and have come to the conclusionthat it is an improvement on the plan suggested by the commonwealth communities Council, and they are prepared to accept it subject to concurrence of the Governments of the United Kingdom and Dominions and subject to the comments set out below :  (1) With regard to local Corporations, while the Government concerned would consult the Central Board before appointing the Chief Executive ofthe local Corporation, the final appointment would be the sole responsibilityof the Government concerned.(2) The Director-General of the local Corporation would be the servantof that Corporation, but would carry out the instructions of the central board in the sphere of its functions.(3) The Central Board would treat the U.K., the Dominion and Indiancitizens as equally eligible for appointments to posts under the Central Board.(4) Subject to the settlement at the projected Conference in London ofacceptable principles as regards the basis on which the pooled net receiptswould be apportioned between the different local Corporations by the central board, the Government of India agree to the principle of pooling of net receipts.(5) When the principle of pooling of net receipts is accepted, theGovernment of India feel that it would probably be necessary to prescribethat the budgets of the local Corporations should be approved by the central board.(6) The Government of India consider that it should be open to thecountries of the Commonwealth to form their local Corporation either by statute or by any other method that may be considered suitable so long as itis ensured that the Corporation so formed is firmly bound to carry out the directions of the Central Board in matters reserved to it.(7) The Government of India consider that the local Corporations inthe U.K, the Dominions and India should be vested with the function of operating all overseas telecommunications, including overseas telephones bycable or wireless.(8) In starting the local Corporations, the Government of India considerthat over-capitalisation should be avoided and care should be taken to see thatthe capital of such Corporations represents the real value of the assetsrequired for communication.(9) The Central Board as at present contemplated is formed of repre-sentatives of the Governments of the U.K., the Dominions and India and one representative for the Colonies. It is not clear whether any limit would beplaced on the numbers of Dominion or non-Dominion countries which mightbe admitted to the membership of the Central Board, and the Governmentof India consider that it is desirable to have a limit and a criterion for admission and that this question might be considered at the london conference.5. The Government of India have examined with interest the proposals made by the Prime Minister of New Zealand suggesting the formation of one central Empire and Commonwealth organisation, the capital of which wouldbe held by all partner Governments on an agreed and equitable basis. Theyappreciate the advantages which such a scheme would have in ensuring unity
of interest and control, but they feel that even with the local organisationsenvisaged under that scheme, such a scheme would not be acceptable to India.They would, however, raise no objection to the consideration of the proposal made by New Zealand at the Conference to be held in London later this year.6. The Government of India greatly appreciate the visit of yourself and your colleagues to this country for the purpose of explaining the views of theGovernment of the United Kingdom and for discussing alternative schemes.These discussions have been most valuable and the Government of India considerthat the new scheme which has been tentatively agreed to by the Governments ofthe Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand and which the Governmentof India also now accept subject to the observations made in paragraph 4 above is a great advance on the previous plan suggested by the Commonwealth Com-munications Council. They look forward to an early realisation of the schemeso that the peoples of the British Commonwealth and Empire may benefit froman improved, efficient and cheaper telecommunications system.ANNEX  5D.Letter from Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister.   27.2.45.The proposals for Empire telecommunications based on the Anzac Plan and extensions and the position of this Colony as a link in the Empire chain were discussed with you and your colleagues by representatives of my Governmentyesterday.As a result of these deliberations we are of the opinion that the New Zealandproposals appear to form the basis of a workable plan, and we agree with thealternative to the Canberra proposals outlined in Paragraph 5 of the letter addressed to you by the Prime Minister of New Zealand, dated the12th February, 1945.We attach particular importance to the following aspects of the New ZealandScheme : 1. The general principle of one central corporation owning all the assets of the partner Governments.2. We should like the precise machinery for purely local operation, includingthe conception of management by a regional organisation of theCentral Body, to be considered at the Conference which it is proposedto hold in London.3. The provisions for reference back on matters of Governmental policycontained in paragraph 3 (c), (d) and (e) of the Canberra JointDocument.4. The equitable allocation among Partner Governments of capital expendi-ture in the acquisition of the assets of Cable and Wireless (Operating),Ltd., and any further capital undertakings.5. It is assumed that Paragraph 5 (c) of the New Zealand Scheme contem-plates that consideration will be given to such questions as the termson which capital is to be provided by the Partner Governments,including interest rates and provision for sinking funds.We desire to draw your attention to the fact that the Central AfricanCouncil, recently constituted by the Government of the United Kingdom pro-vides, inter alia, for the co-ordination of intercommunication between the territories of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In ouropinion, the treatment of these three territories as one unit constituting a PartnerGovernment will call for consideration, but if such an arrangement was not acceptable Southern Rhodesia would claim the status of a Partner Government.My Government are very much alive to the issues at stake and to the greatimportance of your mission in its endeavour to bring about that co-co-ordination between the Dominions and the Mother Country which is essential to the creationof a workable and efficient Empire telecommunications network.We are also grateful to you and your colleagues for the careful and lucidexplanations you gave of the problems which confront the Empire in thisconnection. We hope and believe that your mission will result in a satisfactory solution being found to these difficult problems.
ANNEX 5E.Letter from South African Prime Minister.  5.3.45.The discussions of the last few days have brought about a clearer under-standing of what is needed if a sound Commonwealth telecommunication system is to be achieved and maintained.I should like to assure you, as I did at our first meeting, that the Union ofSouth Africa will participate in what is necessary to achieve this end as fully as the other Dominions and India. Our desire to do so is, I believe, evidenced by our attitude and actions in the past.The scheme worked out in Canberra, and which you have discussed with theGovernments of New Zealand, India and Southern Rhodesia, cannot, in myopinion, be accepted without qualification and in the attached memorandum Iset out the modifications which I conceive to be necessary and which I consideras most appropriate to the present pattern of Commonwealth relations.I should be sorry if these modifications were taken by the U.K. Government,or the Government of any of the Dominions or of India, as indications of anyreluctance or hesitation on the part of the Union Government to give full effectto its voluntary co-operation. They have no such intention. On the contrary,the Union Government will be found to be as co-operative as any.Representatives of the Union Government will attend the conference to beheld shortly in London, and I hope that there a fully worked out scheme will beproduced which will carry into effect the common desires of all PartnerGovernments.I would conclude by adding that it has been a great pleasure to receive you and the members of your delegation in South Africa. The conversations that have taken place during the last few days have been of much value and will, i hope, bear useful and lasting fruit.Memorandum to Prime Minister&apos;s Letter.1. The Union Government is prepared to co-operate with the PartnerGovernments through a consultative body to the fullest extent in the operation,maintenance and development of the Commonwealth telecommunication system.The consultative body should have headquarters in London, remain in continuoussession, and consist of a member from each Partner Government and an indepen-dent chairman.  The body should have whatever executive staff is necessary.2. (a) The Union Government wish to emphasise that neither the UnionGovernment nor any Public Utility Corporation formed in the union would be bound to carry out proposals of the Central ConsultativeBody, unless approved by the Government or the Corporation. the relevant clauses of the Canberra Document should be amendedaccordingly.(&amp;) The precise form of local organisation might be reserved for furtherconsideration.(c) The financial arrangements should be considered at the London conferencein the light of the Union Government&apos;s view that the function of theCentral Body in relation to the Union would be consultative and notdirective.3. It is the view of the Union Government that the Canberra document somodified would provide a workable plan for the fullest co-operation between thePartner Governments in the operation, maintenance and development of theCommonwealth telecommunication system.ANNEX 5F.Letter from Canadian Prime Minister.   15.3.45.I regret that my enforced absence from Ottawa has prevented me fromparticipating in the conversations with you and your colleagues concerning there organisation of the Commonwealth telecommunications services.[29503] , D
Based upon the discussions which my colleagues have had with your mission,and upon their examination in the Cabinet, I think I might describe the positionof the Canadian Government as follows : As we informed the U.K. High Commissioner in Canada in our letterof the 2nd March, we are prepared to create a publicly-owned company inCanada, to operate external communications and to co-operate with Common-wealth and other telecommunications bodies. We would, of course, assumefull financial responsibility for this company.As a consequence of the information given to us by you in these discussions, we are also prepared to co-operate in the creation of a Common-wealth&quot; body on the lines suggested in the Canberra paper, but with the modifications proposed by Field-Marshal Smuts in his letter to you of 5th March, 1945, which makes it clear that the central body shall beconsultative.I have also two additional qualifications to make arising out of the particular circumstances of Canada : :(1). As was explained in our discussions with your Mission, the Canadianinterest in Commonwealth telecommunications questions is not of thesame order of magnitude as that of some of the other countries of theCommonwealth; in particular, the field of co-operation between canada and the United States in communications bulks large in proportion to our overseas communications. For that reason, in any discussion of allocation of costs and maintenance of the Commonwealthtelecommunications system, the Canadian Government will wish to reserve its position until further details have been obtained.(2) In our discussions with your Mission it became clear that negotiations- with the United States, in which all Commonwealth Governments maybe concerned, on such topics as direct circuits and rate structures,would be desirable at the earliest possible date. The Canadian Govern-ment could not take any action, at this stage or in subsequent discussions with the Commonwealth Governments in London, in respectof the Commonwealth telecommunications system which might prejudice our common interest in reaching, if possible, broader inter-national agreements in this field and, in particular, in securingsatisfactory measures of co-operation with the United States. We feelthat the London Conference should consider not only the form and functions of the central body, but also the manner and timing of theforthcoming negotiations with the U.S.A. and the policy to be adoptedtherein.May I express, on behalf of the Canadian Government, our appreciation forthe manner in which you and your colleagues have presented the problems of commonwealth telecommunications and assure you that the Canadian Govern-ment, for its part, will continue to co-operate in seeking a solution for them?ANNEX 6.Notes of Discussions.A. Australia.Prime Minister, Treasurer (Mr. Chiffiey), and Minister for External Affairs(Dr. Evatt) participated throughout. Officials were led by McVey, Director-General of the Post Office, originator of the plan. His attitude, and, indeed,that of ministers and officials generally, was : Anzac, whole Anzac, nothing butAnzac; they had all understood the plan would be approved by U.K. Govern-ment, as it had been by every other; six months&apos; delay, then this ominous mission;what was wrong with Anzac anyhow 1In six days, 110 hours of incessant parleying on both ministerial and official levels. Determining aid from the Prime Minister who accepted, and tocolleagues insisted, that pooling of sovereignty was no surrender of it, andthat there might therefore be the kind of central body we were urging.   Qualms
and obstructions from the other ministers; occasional, immense, though elusive,help from the Secretary of the Treasury (McFarlane); * querulous opposition from the Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet (Strachan); and the Deputy Solicitor-General (Castieau). Two papers eventually prepared : one by them on the multi-corporation basis but with maximum central control; the other by us on the single corporation basis but with maximum local autonomy. Tactful presenta-tions; sheer weight and logic of successive arguments; the two papers werereconcilable and reconciled. Periodic attempts to recover ground lost, culmin-ating in an amazing endeavour on the last night to substitute a new andradically different document for one which had a few hours earlier been jointlyprepared for final submission to the Cabinet Committee on the morrow.Embarrassment of McVey was obvious; he was party to it but not responsiblefor it; nor did we feel he approved of it.McVey remarked next morning that he had feared we were going to walkout. In fact, we had manifested the symptoms of such a drastic course. when we all left together, it was in the uneasy hilarity of averted crisis, but in our hands was the original document. Next morning McVey was as royalist asthe king. We were interested auditors of internecine Australian argument on points of detail, of impressive imperial obiter dicta from the Prime Minister tocolleagues and officials, by. now only mildly recalcitrant. He ended thus : &quot;Ifeverybody is to take a purely national view, then it&apos;s goodnight to hopes of peace,leagues of nations, security, confraternity, and all the rest of it. Nothing butbloody tanks and guns.&quot; Discussions ended in harmonious interchange ofbandinage, mutual congratulations and expressions of esteem. Anzac had beenanglo-anzacised.The Prime Minister has committed himself to the greater efficiency of asingle Empire corporation, and to a possibly early development thereto. Politicsalone prevented his immediate endorsement of it. We felt we had it in essencenow in the Canberra proposals.B. New Zealand.This was easier, but by no means easy, going. The Australian document(received in advance) had much surprised and even disconcerted them in viewof the hitherto rigid adherence expressed to Anzac. We began at the beginningas in Australia. Prime Minister and Minister of Finance (Mr. Nash) particu-pated throughout the four days. Officials were led by Young, just retiredfrom the Post Office Director-Generalship and recalled for the purpose. more effective were Secretary of the Treasury (Ashwin), and Cabinet Deputy Secretary(Shanahan).Before long it was clear that they would not reject the Canberraproposals. They were even persuaded to agree that full budgetary control bythe central body (not just criticism) was necessary and to say so. But there wasa mysterious hesitation about saying they accepted the whole paper. Bothministers were very friendly and anxious to help, but Mr. Nash was manifestingsigns of uneasiness. Diagnosing this as a conflict between the Prime Ministersreluctance to throw over the Australians to the extent of advocating a singleEmpire corporation which has been put trenchantly to them and Mr. Nash&apos;desire to make an original contribution of his own, it was suggested to him thatthe central body might hold the local assets which, of course, a single body would automatically do. He seized on this with the result shown in the Prime Ministersletter which, even if not wholly clear, constitutes an advance on Canberra. Theywould like more by way of central control-almost up to the single Empirecorporation but have not quite managed to say so.C. India.No great difficulty had been anticipated in securing Indian assent to theAustralian document. The splendours of Viceregal lodgment were, therefore,somewhat dimmed by His Excellency&apos;s warning that, by his information, theGovernment of India were as Anzac, and no further than Anzac, minded as the australians had been. Any hope that the Viceroy might have got somethingwrong was shattered early next morning. Senior officials of Posts and Telegraphsmore than confirmed it.   No more central control than in Anzac.[29503] E
honble.. Members concerned were Sir Mahomed Usman (Posts and Air)and Sir Jeremy Raisman (Finance). The former was friendly and courteous, butit was soon apparent that the only subject which he was able or willing to discusswas the disastrous effects of Dominion status on India. The latter stood bythroughout, and was immensely helpful, particularly as to the terms of the officialletter. Sir Gurunath Bewoor^ Secretary of the Department of Posts and Air,conducted the discussions, assisted by three senior officials of the Post Office(Shoobert, Edmunds and Swinstead) and a senior representative of Finance(Sen Gupta).Undismayed by the unpropitious news, the usual procedure was followed :objectives, dissatisfactions, apologies for delay, explanation of the mission&apos;position, unhappiness about Anzac, central co-ordination and control for a united front and for efficiency, pooling of sovereign rights, public utilities, &amp;c. It wentquite well. So to the Canberra proposals. Questions thereon were answered&apos;,seemingly satisfactorily. As result of conversation with him alone Bewoor nextclay drafted a report to honble.. Members and gave the requested opportunityto see and comment on before submitting. The comment was incorporated.Canberra proposals approved, subject to reservations, some of which wereunhappily expressed. Sir J. Raisman was privately informed about these, and dealt with them in such wise that when Bewoor produced the draft official letterfor comment, we had none. This showed radical changes in many importantparticulars. He made his way to the Viceroy to explain that he had changed his mind.   We respected him for so doing.D. Southern Rhodesia.We had been warned that the Minister of Finance and Posts and Telegraphs(Mr. Danziger) would be difficult to deal with. His reputation is high in thisrespect. The civility of our reception was mixed with a certain uneasiness and reserve. Three hours&apos; ab initio presentation, explanation and discussion with him,the Secretary of the Treasury (Strachan) and the Postmaster-General (Harpham)passed in great courtesy but equal shrewdness of examination. The peculiarity oftheir position in the centre of a continent was emphasised and fully appreciated.They seemed not only satisfied but prepared to go considerably further in central control. They would have been prepared to accept the single Empire corporationscheme. They would write a report to the Prime Minister. Might we see this in draft? By all means; and our thanks were repudiated in terms of theindebtedness being on their side.When next day the draft of the Prime Ministers letter was presented, wewere able by exclusion, inclusion and amendment materially to increase its value.The Minister was extraordinarily amenable. Our expressions of gratitude were again repudiated. The boot, he said, was altogether on the other foot. They hadbeen apprehensive of our advent and of the attitude we would adopt with them.Such had it been that he felt they should do everything they could to help us.&quot; If you had asked me to transfer the credit balances of the Southern rhodesian government to you, I think I would have done it.&quot;E. South Africa.It was realised that here we should meet circumstances radically different from any before encountered, and in two respects : (1) If the Prime Minister were personally interested, his views would prevail,irrespective of any degree of conversion of other ministers or officials,and no attempt to change his mind would be ventured by them.(2) If the Canberra, or any other scheme, conflicted, or seemed in his mind to conflict, in any particular with his ideas of &quot; Commonwealthpattern &quot; abstract and immutable this would probably have beenmade clear by him in advance, and the others would be unable andunwilling to discuss it, however much of another mind and anxious todo so they might be or become. And to this latter effect we hadcategoric advice on arrival.The extreme cordiality of the Prime Minister&apos;s welcome next morning was followed by a courteous and regretful intimation that it was utterly impossiblefor him to accept anything at all by way of obligatory co-operation; and that,even if convinced of the desirability or need for it as he quite expected to be he could not face the political opposition which would be aroused. And he addedlater that he was thinking also of the time when he himself was no longer in
control. It was even disclosed that the anaemic co-ordination of Anzac was, incertain particulars, unacceptable to him.With this Olympian non possumus, discussions took place variously withthe Minister of Finance (Mr. Hofmeyr), Minister of Interior and Posts andTelegraphs (Senator Clarkson), Secretary for External Affairs (Forsyth),Postmaster-General (Burke), Director-General of Communications (Smith).Senator Clarkson and officials were obviously impressed by our arguments, butoppressed by the ex cathedra edict. So even was Mr. Hofmeyr, successordesignate. The air was heavy with apologetic embarrassment. A personal request to the Prime Minister to lift the embargo to the extent anyhow of permittingdiscussion and explanation was at once accepted, but to experienced officials itcarried no conviction.Almost everything we said was accepted and agreed. It was all splendid;it was just what was needed. But it was all politically impossible; the general had said so. The fact that there were safeguards in the Canberra paper by which no Government was bound to accept a decision of the central body on any matterof Government policy about which it was not happy, and hence that the central body was in fact, or could be regarded as, consultative was most interesting, butit did not affect the situation or ease their difficulties. And not even the fear that their recalcitrance might cause the United Kingdom Government to leavethings as they were was of avail much as they would deplore this.After Sisyphean labour, and one sidestepping demonstration by Sisyphus,we so increased the embarrassment and, be it clear, the genuine regrets ofSenator Clarkson and the officials, as to secure from them an almost eageracceptance of a suggestion that we should give them a draft letter and memo-randum for the Prime Minister to sign. And such had their attitude become, thatthese papers were adopted without alteration for submission to the PrimeMinister.But there were some expressions they were unable to get the Prime Minister toaccept, notably that any changes he wanted were &apos;&apos; of form rather than of substance.&quot; In the final interview, however, he was most insistent that results ofvisit should not be regarded in any way as unsatisfactory, and gave emphaticassurances of his co-operation, and of his view that all Canberra objectives couldbe secured.F. Canada.An officially frosty reception in Canada was all along anticipated evenwithout a discouraging signal sent to Capetown. This said, in effect, that we need not even talk about the Canberra proposals; they were only willing toconsider some slight modifications to the C.C.C.The High Commissioner confirmed this, and did not think we would movethem. Even the South African qualification would commit them beyond whatthey would accept.The Prime Minister being in Washington, the discussions were conducted by the Minister of Munitions and Supply (Mr. Howe). Of determining influencewas the Head of External Affairs (Robertson). Finance (Sharp). Transport(Rush) and several other officials participated.A private talk at the outset with Mr. Howe proved very helpful throughout.Canadian external communications link with those of the United States;they are not dependent on the Commonwealth system. Moreover, the Canadiansare more internationally than imperially minded. They are set against anything which might even appear to be &quot; ganging up against America.&quot; And they haveno complaints about the present set-up.All this was at great length expounded to us, but, thanks to Mr. Howe, and,after a private talk with Robertson, to his desire to meet us as far as possible, it seemed that they might consider something on the lines of the South Africanletter.Formulae to overcome their difficulties were suggested to Robertson, and eventually we were given a draft letter which the Prime Minister was to be invitedto sign. Our request to be allowed to amend it in several respects was accepted and so were the amendments.Canada has agreed, notwithstanding their peculiar position and particularattitude, to co-operate on the same basis as South Africa.
