THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1045.SECRET. \ /Copy NoW.P. (45) 228.10th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS  OF  COLONIAL  POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs as Chairmanof the British Commonwealth Meetings on World Organisation.AT their 38th Meeting* the War Cabinet approved, subject to two amend-ments, the recommendations made by the Armistice and Post-War Committee in w.P. (45) 200 that the Dominion Governments should be informed, by an oralstatement at the British Commonwealth Meetings of the policy which HisMajesty&apos;s Government proposed to adopt in the discussions in Washington andSan Francisco on the question of &quot;territorial trusteeship.&quot; This subject was accordingly discussed at the second and third meetings of the Conference.!2. There was general agreement on certain main points which may besummarised as follows : (i) The continuance of a mandatory system in respect of existing mandated territories and territories removed from the enemy.(ii) Any form of international administration was inadvisable on practicalgrounds and the administration of any territory under mandate mustbe entrusted to a single mandatory power.(iii) There could be no question of our surrendering any of our existingMandates.(iv) Certain modifications of detail were desirable in the existing mandate system both in respect of the working of the Permanent mandates commission and in respect of the terms of the Mandates themselves;in particular, the present provisions relating to the defence of the territories and those-conferring equal rights for all nationals of states members of the League with the nationals of the mandatory power in respect of entry and the conduct of business.(v) At the discussions, both in Washington and San Francisco, our aim should be to restrict discussion to the drafting of a general formula for the establishment of a new mandatory system the details of whichshould be discussed later at a special meeting of the Powers most directly interested.(vi) While the establishment of Regional Commissions, wherever these mightbe appropriate, remained the policy of Flis Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom, discussion of the establishment of such councils should not be associated with any discussions either at the preliminarytalks at Washington or in San Francisco.3. While recognising that the Colonial Powers could not be compelled toplace any of their Colonial dependencies under &quot; trusteeship,&quot; the Governmentsof Australia and New Zealand spoke strongly in favour of specific provision being-made to enable territories to be voluntarily placed under trusteeship. They alsourged strongly that the United Kingdom Government should take the lead inputting our Colonies under some measure of international trusteeship. Thereasons advanced in support of these views were two-fold :  (1) While none of the Dominion delegates in any way criticised -the adminis-tration of British Colonies, they considered that the record of someof the other colonial Powers was not so good.   With this in view they* W.M. (45) 88tli Conclusions.f B.C.M. (45) 2nd and 3rd Meetings.[29642]
suggested that it should be a primary object to introduce a system ofinternational trusteeship in the interests of the Colonial peoplesthemselves and thereby to ensure that the policies adopted in thecolonial territories of all colonial Powers were governed by the same principles as had already been applied by the United Kingdom andthe Dominions. The Australian and New Zealand representativeslaid stress on this in connection with the return to France and portugal of territories now occupied by Japan.(2) It was important to do something to meet American criticism, howeverunjustified, of the Colonial activities of the Commonwealth. Weshould demonstrate that we were ready to take the lead in any proposals, provided they were practicable and reasonable, which were designed to improve the conditions of backward peoples and aid themalong the road to self-government.4. It will be seen that only the points dealt with in the preceding paragraphare not covered by the authority already given by the War Cabinet as to the line which our representatives should take in the discussions at Washington and san francisco. It will be necessary for me to give a reply to the Dominion representa-tives on these two points. I assume that there can be no question of our agreeing to place any of our Colonial territories other than those at present administered under mandate under any form of trusteeship, and that we should frankly informthe Dominion Governments of this conclusion. Having regard to the views theyhave expressed, it is, however, for consideration whether we should maintain our opposition to the inclusion of a specific provision enabling territories to bevoluntarily placed under &quot; trusteeship &quot; by the Parent State concerned. If theCabinet felt able to make a concession on this point, it may well be that generalagreement would be secured as to the line which the British Commonwealth shouldtake at San Francisco.C.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,10^A April. 1945.
