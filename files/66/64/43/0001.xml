NAVAL  SITUATION.General Review.1.   There have been some severe coastal craft actions in the North Sea.British carrier-borne aircraft have continued their attacks on the Ryukyusand U.S. carrier-borne aircraft have successfully attacked a Japanese navalsquadron.Home Waters.2. Seventeen enemy commandos have been captured in the Cherbourg area,having landed from the Channel Islands in Vauville Bay. They were detectedby radar and the prisoners were equipped as saboteurs.During the night of the 6th/7th E-boats approached the East Coast towardsYarmouth. They were reported and attacked by Coastal Command aircraft andengaged by H.M. ships Haydon (destroyer), Cubitt (frigate) and M.T.Bs. Oneof the E-boats was sunk and five damaged. Two M.T.Bs. were lost and onedamaged.The following night a group of five E-boats off Ostend were shadowed by-Wellingtons and were engaged by H.M.S. Rutherford (frigate) and M.T.Bs.Two E-boats were sunk and 32 prisoners taken.   Beaufighters attacked midgetson two nights off Ostend and The Hook and one midget was probably sunk.A German two-man U-boat ran aground east of Calais early on the 10th.the crew were made prisoner.Midget U-boats were sunk by an ML. in the Strait of Dover on the 10thand by an M.T.B. off Dungeness on the night of the llth/12th.Enemy shore batteries on Alderney shelled a radar station S.W. of Cherbourgcontinuously on the 11th.3. During the week ending the 8th the combined British and U.S. dischargesthrough the liberated ports were approximately : 87,500 men, 7,500 vehicles,465,000 tons of stores, 39,000 tons of coal, 155,000 tons of petrol, 57,000 tons ofammunition.4. H.M.S. Biter (escort carrier) was turned over to the French Navyon the 9th and renamed Dixmude.Bay of Biscay.5. On the 6th, the French frigate L&apos;Aventure sighted and engaged two enemy minesweepers but they escaped into P. d&apos;Antioche. French destroyerson patrol on the 11th captured a trawler and took five Germans prisoners of war.Mediterranean.6. H.M. destroyers Ma me and Lookout have been bombarding enemy positions in support of the Fifth Army.On the 9th, a serious explosion occurred in Bari harbour caused by theblowing up of an ammunition ship, the s.s. Charles Henderson (7,176 tons, U.S.),which sank. Three cargo ships were set on fire and six other ships and the Italiancorvette Folaga were damaged. Severe damage was caused to JNavy House andthe naval barracks. Naval casualties amounted to 15 killed and 50 wounded,and there were considerable military and civilian casualties.7. On the night of the 9th/ 10th coastal forces fought two actions withconvoys of armed lighters in the northern Adriatic. Two lighters were sunk andothers damaged. One M.T.B. was severely damaged and was towed to Ancona;our casualties were four killed and 15 wounded.Landing craft and coastal craft are supporting the Yugoslav advance up theCroatian coast. First reports from the captured ports of Pag, Karlobag andJabenlac (50 miles S.E. of Fiume) state that there have been no demolitions andthe harbours appear clear of mines.Bast Indies.8. Previous to the 5th April H.M. ships Rot her ham, Redoubt, Racehorseand Rocket (destroyers) carried out an anti-shipping sweep in the Andamansarea : the radar station on Great Coco Island was shelled and an auxiliarycoaster and a junk were sunk in the Tavoy area.British submarines, on patrol in the Malacca Strait and off the Tenasserimcoast, sank ten native craft loaded with war material.
9. On the 6th and 7th April naval aircraft of the British Pacific Fleet madea third series of attacks on islands of the Sakishima group (Ryukyus) and the airfield on Myako was so heavily bombed as to make it probably unserviceable.Two out of four enemy aircraft which attempted to attack our Fleet were shot down by fighters and a third by gunfire and fighters. One enemy aircraft struckthe superstructure of H.M.S. Illustrious with its wing tip and crashed along-side. In these engagements a total of five enemy aircraft were destroyed in theair and three on the ground.10. On the 6th. strong forces of Japanese aircraft attacked the U.S. Fleetoff Okinawa. Three U.S. destroyers were sunk and seven U.S. aircraft were lost.In addition, several destroyers and small craft were damaged. It is reported that350 Japanese aircraft were destroyed.11. Early on the 7th April US. reconnaissance aircraft sighted a Japanesenaval force passing westward along the south coast of Kyushu. This force isbelieved to have consisted of the 16-inch battleship Yamato, two light cruisers and nine destroyers. Aircraft from U.S. carriers attacked the enemy force in aposition about 50 miles S.W. of Kyushu, and the Yamato, the light cruiserA gano, another light cruiser or destroyer and three destroyers were sunk. Inaddition, two other destroyers were set on fire. Seven ITS. aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire, which was heavy.12. On the 6th, a Natori class cruiser with four escorts, was attacked inthe Soemba Strait by Dutch-manned Mitchell aircraft and Australian Liberators.Early on the 7th April this ship was attacked by two U.S. submarines whilstleaving Bima Bay with two escorts, and is believed to have been sunk.Allied Minelaying.13. H.M. Ships and the Dutch Willum Van der Zaan have laid a largenumber of mines in Home Waters.Aircraft laid mines in the Baltic and also in the Adriatic and in EastIndian waters.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.14. There was E-boat activity off the East Coast on one night but mine-laying is not suspected. In the vicinity of the swept channels to Ostend/Scheldtmines may have been jettisoned by E-boats and sweeping is in progress.In the Mediterranean sweeping of Herakleion Bay, Crete, has commencedand 12 mines were destroyed. Off Patras 34 mines have been destroyed andsweeping has also continued in the Adriatic.The mine totals ai^e 6,504 ground and 9,593 moored.Enemy Intelligence.15. Reconnaissance of Kiel on the 10th showed the Scheer capsized (see&quot; Air Situation &quot;) and Hipper and Emden, probably damaged. At Wilhelms-haven the Koln is now sunk. The Leipzig was sighted at Aabenraa on the 8th andthe Numb erg was reported at Copenhagen.The Gneisenau and ScJilesioig-Holstein are believed scuttled at Gdynia andthe Seydlitz at Konigsberg.Reconnaissance of Emden has shown preparations for the mining of thequays.U-boats.16. There has been activity by U-boats in the Channel and S.W. approaches.Elsewhere U-boats have been operating off the East coast of the United States andpossibly off the Canary Islands.17. A small number of the short-range prefabricated Type XXIII U-boatshave now operated from Norwegian bases. Their endurance is at least threeweeks, and their surface displacement 230 tons. At least fifty of them are nowcomplete, and during March reconnaissance located boats of this type at Stavangerand christians and South.   One was seen at Horten on the 29th January.[29646] &apos;   B
Anti-Submarine Operations.18. During the week 51 attacks on U-boats were reported, of which 18 wereby shore-based aircraft, 32 by warships and one by a merchant ship. In additionone U-boat was probably sunk by a mine.On the 6th TIMS.&quot;Watchman (destroyer) and H.M.C.S. Loch Alvie (frigate)sank a U-boat off the Isle of Wight and 15 prisoners of war were taken.On the 3rd two U-boats were probably sunk during the air raid on Kiel and onthe 8th H.M. ships Colder and Bentinck (frigates) probably sank a U-boat in theS.W. approaches. Mosquitoes probably sank two U-boats in the Skagerrak onthe 9th.H.M. ships Petunia and Stonecrop (corvettes) possibly sank a U-boat in the bay of Biscay and a Liberator possibly sank another off the Shetlands.Enemy Attack on Shipping.19. During the week four ships, totalling 20,500 tons, are known to havebeen sunk.The s.s. Cuba (11,420 tons) carrying passengers was sunk by a U-boat off the isle of Wight: there was one life lost. A U.S. ship in an homeward atlantic convoy was torpedoed by a U-boat off Anglesey and reached port in tow. A U.S.tanker was torpedoed off Cape Cod.One U.S. ship was sunk by a midget and another ship torpedoed in a coastalconvoy off Dungeness.A small U.S. tanker was sunk off Ostend and damage was caused either by mine or torpedo to a U.S. ship in convoy north of Havre, to a ship in outwardAtlantic convoy off Dungeness and to one off St. Abb&apos;s Head.20. Shipping losses by enemy action in March amounted to 21 ships, of87,367 tons, which is a slight decrease on the figures for February. With theaddition of marine casualties the total of losses from all causes amounted to33 ships, of 104,545 tons. Thirteen ships, of 46,694 tons,, were sunk by U-boats,including three ships which were probably sunk by midgets. All of these were sunk in U.K. coastal waters, except for one ship in the Barents Sea and one in the South Atlantic. Five ships, totalling 35,914 tons, were sunk by mines inU.K. coastal waters. Two ships, of 3,968 tons, were sunk by E-boats offthe East Coast. A small British ship was captured at Granville and towecl awayby a raiding: partv from the Channel Islands.Protection of Seaborne Trade.21. During March, 24 convoys of 524 ships arrived in the United kingdom without loss by enemy action and two convoys, originally of 44 ships, lost three ships before arrival. A further 278 ships from 12 of these convoys proceededdirect to Continental ports. Twenty-six outward-bound convoys of 927 shipsreached their destinations without loss and three convoys, originally of 55 ships,lost four ships before arrival, including one ship lost in a convoy of 26 ships to north Russia. In U.K. coastal waters 3,089 ships in 197 convoys reached their destinations : nine ships were lost by enemy action.Fifteen U.S. convoys of 579 ships to and from Gibraltar reached their destinations without loss. In the Caribbean and West Atlantic 437 ships in111 convoys and, in the Indian Ocean, 46 ships in 17 convoys arrived without loss.Enemy Merchant Shipping.22. Since 17th March there has been a considerable hold-up in the shipping of troops from Southern Norway to Denmark. This is believed to have been due to the shortage of transports rather than to a decision to stop the with-drawal of troops from Norway. A division is now believed to be in process of withdrawl, making eleven divisions in Norway and one in transit. It is esti-mated that during the last three weeks approximately 50,000 tons of transporttonnage arrived in Danish ports.23. The Japanese mercantile marine on the outbreak of war with the U.S.was estimated at 6,665,000 tons in ships of 1,000 tons and over, of which 590,000tons were tankers. New construction in 1942 was estimated at 240,000 tons(tankers, 20,000 tons); in 1943,600,000 tons (tankers, 200,000 tons); in 1944.1,150,000 tons (tankers, 600,000 tons) and in 1945 up to April 1st, 300,000 tons(tankers, 180.000 tons).   The total losses up to the beginning of this month were
estimated at 7,145,000 tons, including 915,000 tons of tankers. It appears, there-fore, that no more than 1,810,000 tons of shipping, including 675,000 tons of tankers, were afloat on. 1st April. Of this total 360,000 tons (tankers. 135,000tons) are believed to be under repair.These estimates do not take into account ships used for carrying oil in bulkor as naval auxiliaries, the number of which is likely to be small.military SITUATION.Western Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.24. The encirclement of the Ruhr basin by First and Ninth U.S. Armiesbefore the enemy had made any attempt to pull out, has successfully enclosed thewhole of the German Army Group B together with part of Army Group FTDespite repeated attempts on their part to break out first to the north and then to the east, these remain completely cut off and are faced with destruction.Meanwhile east of the pocket, a gap yawned in the enemy&apos;s line where themissing divisions should have been, allowing the Allies to advance on a frontbetween Fulda and Bremen meeting only scrappy opposition. Good progress has been &quot;made by the Southern and Northern Groups of Armies althoughopposition in these sectors has been stronger.Southern Sector.25. The First French Army has made progress along its entire front east of the Rhine, Karlsruhe was captured on the 5th, Pforzheim three days laterand forward troops are within 10 miles of Stuttgart.The Seventh U.S. Army, which seized crossings over the River Main southof Wurzburg on the 4th, captured the town by the 7th and on the same dayoccupied Heilbronn in the face of determined opposition. They have . sinceadvanced on a wide front north of Wurzburg in conjunction with First FJ.S.Army and on the 11th April reached Schweinfurt and Coburg.Central Sector.28. Coincident with the capture of Cassel on the 5th, Third U.S. Armyturned its main weight eastwards to capture Mulhausen and, mopping up in thewake of its armoured spearheads, gained from 30 to 40 miles along the wholeof its front reaching Ilmenau and Erfurt on the 11th.North of Cassel, First U.S. Army crossed the River Weser to captureGottingen on the 8th and reached Nordhausen two days later. Further north,Ninth U.S. Army (which reverted to the command of &quot;the Central Group or armies on the 4th) made contact with Second British Army at Minden and onthe 5th crossed the River Weser in the Hamelin area. This brid. rehead was rapidly expanded to the River Leine which in turn was crossed and Hildesheimcaptured on the 9th. Hanover fell on the following day and armoured columnsby-passing Brunswick to the north have since reached the River Elbe in thevicinity of Magdeburg.Despite repeated attempts by the enemy to extricate himself, the encircledRuhr pocket has been steadily compressed and reduced to an area of some 50 milesby 40 miles from one of 80 miles by 60 miles at the beginning of the week. Essenwas captured on the 10th and the River Ruhr reached to the east of the town.Northern Sector.27. The desperate resistance of enemy parachute and panzer grenadierdivisions has failed to halt the Allied advance to the north. On the right Britisharmour has reached the line of the Aller from Celle to a point 5 miles southof Bremen. In the centre, a Canadian column advancing astride the River Emsis within 25 miles of Emden, while on the left, a thrust to the N.W. throughAlmelo and Coevorden is within 8 miles of Assen and has contacted airborneforces dropped in the Meppen area on the 7th/8th.Opposition has been particularly heavy in the Deventer sector where theenemy has fought very stubbornly to retain his remaining escape route from western Holland.   The town eventually fell on the 11th.Italy.28.   At 1350 hours on the 9th, offensive operations on a large scale were resumed on the Italian front.     A very heavy air and artillery bombardment[29846] b o
opened the attack, and at twilight the ground forces Italian, Indian, NewZealand and Polish were fighting for bridgeheads over the Senio. Considerabletactical surprise was achieved and although enemy resistance was stiff to begin with a bridgehead of up to 3 miles in depth had been secured by mid-day the10th, including the towns of Fusignano, Lugo, and Cotignola. 1,200 prisoners were taken and Allied casualties were light. By 1500 hours on the 11th, theAllied line was up to the right bank of the Santerno River, in the sector betweenFusignano and Soiarolo, and the New Zealanders had a small bridgehead acrossthe river.Support to these thrusts was given, on the right flank in the Alfonsine sector,by Italian forces, and on the left astride Highway 9 and further west at Riolo, byPolish, Italian and Jewish troops.Meanwhile, on the Ligurian coastal sector, U.S. troops of Japanese ancestryand coloured troops have thrust forward to secure Massa, latest reports placingtheir advanced positions within a mile of Carrara.Russian Front.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.29. After completing the mopping up of the German forces left pressedagainst the coast S.W. of Konigsberg, the Russians, on the 8th, launched an allout attack against the town itself. German resistance collapsed after only two days, and the Russians report having taken over 90.000 prisoners.German resistance still continues in the Samland Peninsula N.W. of Konigs-berg, in the area near the mouth of the Vistula, and on the narrow spit of landnorth of Gdynia.Central Sector.30. Only local fighting has been reported along the front from the Baltic tothe Slovakian mountains. Behind the Russian lines, strong attacks have beenreported against the fortress of Breslau, and the Germans have admitted Russianprogress towards the centre of the town.In Slovakia itself the Germans have withdrawn 25-30 miles.Soil them Sector.31. The Soviet advances towards Vienna, both from the east and S.E., have continued steadily. Pressing on past Bratislava, the Russians have forced theRiver Morava and expanded their bridgehead to the west and north.The attack on Vienna from the south first outflanked the city to the westby cutting the Vienna-Linz road on the 5th; the subsequent assault on the capitalitself was made from the S.E., south and west and has now pushed the Germansback to the Danube, leaving three-quarters of the city in Russian hands.No further progress has been made towards Graz and Maribor, but theRussians have extended their extreme left flank closer to the line of the RiverDrava.Burma.     (An outline map is included as an inset.)32. In the Arakan, progress has been slow. Forward troops are now2 miles north of Taungup.In Central Burma our troops have been re-grouping. Enemy pockets inside the Taungtha-Meiktila-Mandalay triangle are being cleared. Thazi was finallycleared of the enemy on the 10th.The advance south started on the 8th and our troops are now 35 miles southof Meiktila and have entered Yamethin. Yanaung was captured by an armouredcolumn oi) the 10th and on the same day the landing ground 2 miles N.W. ofPyawbwe was reached.In Northern Burma progress down the Lash io--Ma tidal ay road has continued and only 6 miles of the road. N.E. of Maymyo, remain to be cleared.China.33. In N.W. Hupeh Japanese forces occupied the town of Laphokou onthe 8th, and contact between these forces and the columns advancing N.W. fromSiangyang has probably been established.Nanyang (in S.W. Honan) was apparently evacuated by the Chinese duringthe first few days of April.
Luzon.34. U.S. forces advancing along the northern and southern shores of Lagunade Bay have established contact in the area of Santa Cruz. On the 5th a smallU.S. airborne force captured Lucena town and airfield. This force has now linked up with the main US. forces in Southern Luzon.The U.S. troops, which landed at Legaspi in the extreme S.E. tip of Luzon,have occupied Sorsogon.Japanese casualties up to 8th April total 106,894 killed and. 1,053 prisoners.Other Philip-pine Islands.35. On the 9th, U.S. forces carried out an unopposed landing on Busuanga,the largest island in the Calamian Group, to the N.E. of Palawan.The same day further U.S. troops landed on Holo Island, between Mindanaoand the Tawi Tawi Group. The Tawi Tawi Group has now been cleared by .S. forces.Ryukyus.36. On Okinawa, 3 U.S. Marine Amphibious Corps has made substantial progress noithwards, and holds a line stretching from Nago to Orawan Bay.Leading troops of 24 U.S. Army Corps in the south are now within 4 miles ofNaha, the capital.   Stronger resistance has been encountered in this sector.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.37. Fighter Command flew 34 defensive sorties. No enemy activity against this country has been reported.Home Waters.38. Aircraft of Coastal Command flew 1,508 sorties; 17 aircraft are missing.The main anti-shipping operation of the week was carried out by 38 escortedMosquitoes against a convoy 50 miles E.S.E. of Aalborg; 5 ships were leftburning fiercely, and one escort vessel and one coaster sinking. The majorityof the remainder of the week&apos;s attacks were also made in the Skaggerak andKattegat, in the course of which 12 ships (average tonnage about 3,000) were hit.In Songefiord R.P. Beaufighters left two ships (2,000/3,000 tons) and one escort vessel emitting smoke.Bomber Command laid 485 sea-mines.Western Europe.39. In the week ended dawn on the 11th, aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) flew23.913 sorties and dropped 7,971 tons of bombs. In the week ended dawn onthe 12th, aircraft of Bomber Command and the U.S. VIII Bomber Commandflew 9,054 sorties by day and 2,861 by night and dropped 28,496 tons. fighter command and the U.S. VIII Fighter Command flew 6,213 sorties. Two hundredand eight Allied aircraft are missing; 329 enemy aircraft were destroyed in theair and 924 on the ground.The prevailing weather throughout the week was such that both our strategic and tactical air forces carried out extensive operations. Only sporadic enemy air opposition was, however, provoked, the fighter effort by the G.A.F. being some150/200 sorties by day and about 50 on 3 nights of the,week. Frequent changes of base and disruption of supply channels appear to have reduced ground attackunits to the state of impotence.The heavy bomber targets from north to south of Central Germany were bothnumerous and diverse, and the majority of the attacks were made visually ; on only three occasions, however, were more than 1,000 tons released on any one objective.Thirty-two attacks were made on airfields with particular success (7,058 tons);escorting fighters destroyed over 400 aircraft on the ground. A total of 8.881 tons were released on a number of railway centres; bombing -was accurate on those at Leipzig (303 tons by night and 1,493 by day) and at Plauen (1,188 tons by night and 578 by day), whilst Nuremberg received 1,265 tons. Good results are also reported from attacks on 10 ordnance depots (total 2,639 tons, of which
s701 were delivered on that at Oranienburg), on 8 oil storage depots (1,708 tons),and on 4 explosive works (1,260 tons). The principal night operation was againstthe shipyards at Kiel (2.634 tons); photographs show the pocket battleshipAdmiral Scheer overturned at her berth, two near misses to the cruiser AdmiralHipper, possible blast damage to the cruiser Emden, and severe damagethroughout the Deutsche Werke shipyards. The port area of Hamburg, includingthe Blohm and Voss U-boat yards, was bombed by night (1,491 tons) and subsequentreconnaissance shows one U-boat sunk and three damaged; the U-boat sheltersin that city were also attacked by Lanoasters (100 tons, including 2 x 22,000 lbs.)and photographs show six direct hits. In order to deny to the enemy the use ofa block ship berthed at Ijmuiden this vessel was attacked by a small force ofLancasters; subsequently she was reported down by the stern with the after welldeck awash and probably resting on the bottom. Night attacks caused extensive damage to the synthetic oil plant at Lutzkendorf (928 tons) and to the oil plant at Molbis (556 tons).Mosquitoes continued their night operations, which included 248 sorties to berlin.A dozen captured airfields in Germany are now operational, and during theweek tactical aircraft were accordingly enabled to extend the scope of their operations to include Berlin and railway targets in Czechoslovakia amongst their objectives. Mediums, operating at night on a comparatively small scale, attacked enemy movement over a wide area. By day very good results were obtained on a variety of targets of a similar nature to those attacked by the heavy bombers, themost outstanding being the railway centres at Gottingen, Northeim, Celle,Saalfeld, Schweinfurt and Cloppenburg and the ammunition dump atKlem-En stino;en.Transport operations for the armies were maintained on a large scale. Atotal of over 6,000 sorties (two aircraft missing) were flown on supply operationsparticularly to the forward areas: nearly 16.000 tons of petrol and other supplies were carried, and 15,500 casualties and 12,900 prisoners of war and otherrepatriates&apos;evacuated. On the night 7th/8th 46 Stirlings dropped paratroops inthe Assen/Meppel area.   (See para. 27 : Military Situation.)A daily average of about 2.400 sorties by fighters and fighter-bombers ofS.H.A.E.F. (Air) were flown in providing escorts for the mediums, in close support for our ground forces and in attacking a diversity of military targets,including airfields. With improved visibility considerable success was achieved.Over 150 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and 500 on the ground in thecourse of these operations. Very large numbers of enemy transport vehicles are reported to have been destroyed or damaged, including about 500 A.F.V. and500 horse-drawn vehicles.Znote. Appendix VII gives Raid Assessments.Southern Europe.40. In the week ended dusk on the 9th, aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew15,241 sorties (including 3,763 by heavy bombers) and dropped 8,872 tons of bombs.Forty-one enemy aircraft were destroyed and 53 Allied aircraft are missing.Enemy activity was on a very low scale.Railway targets were the primary objectives for the Strategic Air Force.The main attacks in Italy were against the railway centres of Brescia(2 attacks 382 tons; photographs show excellent coverage of the whole yardwith 350 wagons destroyed or damaged), Verona (171 tons) and Trento (138 tons);the locomotive depot at Alessandria (38 miles N.N.W. of Genoa) was bombed and also the railway bridge between Verona and Parona (385 tons bothapproaches heavily cratered) and that at Bressanone (191 tons).Miscellaneous targets included the Udine/Campoformido airfield (391 tons),Monfalcone shipyards (104 tons) and the small arms factory at Brescia (176 tons);good concentrations were obtained in every instance, particularly heavy damagebeing inflicted upon the last-named target.In Yugoslavia the railway centre at Novska (60 miles S.E. of Zagreb) was attacked (photographs show facilities 80 per cent, unserviceable), and heavystructural damage was inflicted to the bridge at Dravograd.Escorting and other fighters of the Strategic Air Force operated with successdaily against enemy communications and airfields in the Munich/Linz/Salzburg/Innsbruck areas; over 70 locomotives and 30 aircraft on the ground were destroyed, as was also a railway bridge E. of Klagenfurt in an attack by82 Lightnings.
On the 9th, in preparation for the offensive by the Eighth Army, 825 heavy bombers dropped 1,510 tons accurately on gun positions and other military objectives in the vicinity of Lugo. Tactical aircraft also flew 1,211 sorties inclose support. On the night 9th/10th 80 Liberators and 155 mediums bombedarmy support targets along the Santerno River with good results and thefollowing day 848 heavies released 1,600 tons on military targets near Lugo, and436 mediums were similarly employed.During the remainder of the week tactical aircraft averaged about 100 sortiesnightly and 800 sorties daily in attacks on communications and supplies, and infurnishing close support to the Allied troops. Railways were cut in more than200 places, and over 1.500 rail and road vehicles (including 325 horse -drawn) were destroyed or damaged. Mitchells flew 97 sorties against the gun positions atSpezia and obtained good concentrations.Baltimores of the Balkan Air Force attacked gun positions on Rab Islandevery day of the week, whilst fighters and fighter-bombers successfully operatedagainst communications and troop concentrations along the valley of the Sava.Aircraft of the Coastal Air Force continued to harass the enemy in N.W. Italy,while Beaufighters attacked shipping in Umago harbour (19 miles S.W. of trieste).Russian Front.41. Heavy air support was afforded by the Russian Air Force in operations against Koenigsberg and Breslau. In attacks on shipping by the Baltic fleet air Component nine supply ships and one destroyer are reported to have been sunk off Danzig.A marked decrease in the effort by the German Air Force has been noticeable.Far East.South-East Asia.42. In the week ended dusk on the 9th, Allied aircraft flew 3,588 sorties,including 2,030 by bombers and fighter-bombers. In addition, Dakota transport aircraft flew 9,173 sorties, carrying 10,983 tons and 8,661 men, and light transport aircraft flew 1,943 sorties, carrying 1,347 men. Nineteen enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground and 11 Allied aircraft are missing.Enemy activity was negligible.Liberators attacked railway bridges in Lower Burma and Siam (242 tons),supply dumps at Rangoon and Moulmein (188 tons) and ferry sidings at Sittang(62 miles N.E. of Rangoon 70 tons), with good results.The Tactical Air Force provided close support for Allied troops in CentralBurma and the Arakan, and attacked a variety of targets. Over 60 bridges,numerous road and rail vehicles and rivercraft were destroyed or damaged, and fires were started, in oil storage and supply areas. Off the coast. 8 small ships were hit.China.43. Docks, shipyards and oil installations and an airfield in the Hong Kong-area, the harbour at Yulin (Hainan), and railway yards at Shihchiachuan(165 miles S.W. of Peiping) were the chief objectives of escorted Liberators,which dropped 420 tons with good effect. At Hong Kong, two medium-sizedships and several small ones were sunk.Medium, light and fighter-bombers attacked communications and airfields,especially in the Yangtze River area.Good attacks were made on enemy shipping; one 10,000-ton ship, one largetransport, one large tanker, one destroyer, two escort vessels and 8 coasterswere sunk.Japan.44. A total of 528 sorties was flown by Super Fortresses against targets in japan; 1,810 tons of bombs were dropped on 4 aircraft factories, and 480 tonson other targets. Some targets were bombed visually with good results. Sixty-four enemy fighters were destroyed in combat and 9 Super-Fortresses are missing.

Two large buildings in each of the ordnance and foodstorage depot buildings have been gutted and many other buildings damaged. Inthe barracks and M.T. area many sheds have been destroyed or damaged.As a result of the attack on 8th April most of the major buildings of theBachmann Von Blumenthal aircraft factory (Me. 262 repairs) have been heavily damaged and the living quarters to the east of the factory have been largelydestroyed. The factory airfield is covered by more than 250 craters, some 30 ofwhich are on the runway.Halberstadi Raihvay Centre. Following the U.S. VIII Air Force attackon 8th April, photographic reconnaissance undertaken later in the day shows that very heavy damage has been caused in the vicinity of the wagon repairshop. What was probably an ammunition train has exploded in the holdingsidings and as a result the wagon repair shop and the engine round-house (in
which can be seen the wreckage of 16 locomotives) have been completely destroyed.In addition, considerable destruction has been caused to rolling-stock and alithrough lines in the passenger station, which is itself severely damaged, havebeen cut, Extensive fires were still burning in the town approximately two hoursafter the attack.Hamburg. Several items of heavy damage have been inflicted in the DeutscheWerft ship and U-boat yards by the U.S. VIII Air Force attack on 30th March.Four assembly shops and a moulding loft have been partially or wholly destroyed and a wet gas holder has been wrecked. &apos; Rail sidings and transhipment facilitieshave also been affected and several small barrack buildings in the western partof the area have been damaged or destroyed. In addition, damage has been caused to docks, an m/v has capsized and a U-boat has been sunk. Heavy damage has also been caused to the Eurotank oil refinery and storage depots as a resultof this and previous attacks.In Bomber Command attack on 4th/5th April on the Rhenania-Ossag oil refinery in the Harburg district, severe damage has been inflicted on the Trumbledistillation unit, especially in the eastern section, where the stills have been affected. Ten of the 19 remaining small tar and oil storage tanks have been gutted or damaged and both boiler houses have again been hit. It is unlikely thatany refining operations will be possible for at least two months.Kiel. Considerable fresh damage has been caused in the shipyards ofKrupp Germania Werft A.G. and Deutsche Werke Kiel A.G., in the NavalDockyard and to shipping in the harbour, by the U.S. VIII force attacks of3rd and 4th April.In the Germania Werft nearly every building has been damaged, and these include a power station, which has been largely destroyed, a boiler house completely destroyed, the erecting and testing shop severely damaged and the angle and plateshaping sheds which are now nearly half destroyed. In the Deutsche Werke atleast seven buildings have been damaged, among them the factory workshop, whichhas been completely destroyed, and the boiler house. In the Naval Dockyard thesouthernmost engine shops already severely damaged have again been hit, andthe western engine shops have also been affected. Between the Deutsche Werkeshipyards and the Naval Dockyard about 15 buildings in the naval arsenal havebeen damaged, many of them severely.Damage has also been caused to railway facilities and the main station onthe western side of Die Horn has been partially destroyed, while to the southseveral craters have cut railway tracks and damaged rolling stock. At the goodsyard heavy damage has been inflicted on the locomotive round-house and rail-sidebuildings; public buildings and business and residential property in the vicinity of the town slaughter-house have all been affected.Shipping which has been sunk or has capsized comprises a 660-ft. liner ofHamburg type and the 530-ft. liner Monte Olivia capsized, and two M class mine-sweepers, one vessel 150 ft.-200 ft., two smaller vessels, and one U-boat sunk.Leipzig. -Photographs, taken on 7th April, show that the main weight of theLkS. VIII Air Force attack on the preceding day has fallen across the junctionof the three main lines north-east of the main passenger station. All throughtracks have been cut and sidings and sheds in the goods yards and storage sidingshave been destroyed. A few railway wagons have been damaged and derailed.In the immediate vicinity of the marshalling yard business and residential property has suffered heavily, and the town gasworks are among the buildingsaffected.Luneburg Railway Centre. Photographs taken on 8th April show thatthe main weight of the U.S. VIII Air Force attack on 7th April has fallenon the goods depot. The wagon repair shop, goods depot and station and the storage sidings have all been damaged and all through tracks and the singletrack to Soltau have been cut. A quantity of rolling stock has been derailed or damaged and some of it was still on fire 24 hours after the attack. There is some business and residential damage west of the marshalling yard.Lutzkendorf-Photographs taken on 8th April, after the attack by bomber command on 4th/5th April, show heavy damage to the synthetic oil plant, whichis inactive. While the Bergius section is so damaged as unlikely to resume for at least a month other sections may be able to operate to some extent within a fortnight, (This report does not cover damage caused in a further attack on 8th/9th April.)I&apos; 296461 r,
Molbis. Photographs taken on 8th April after the Bomber Command attackon 7th/8th April, show very severe damage in all parts of the oil plant. Buildingsaffected include the power stations, the coal drying units and the coal feed system.It is considered that no benzol output will be possible for one month and that even after two months only half the normal figure will be reached.Piemen. Following the U.S. VIII Air Force attack on 8th April, photo-graphic reconnaissance undertaken on the same day shows many fires still burningin the central area of the town as well as in a suburb to the South about fivehours after the attack. The spinning mill of Sachsische Zellwolle is amongbuildings on fire and the cellulose factory of the same concern has been damaged.The large Schloss which is partly gutted is in the centre of an area of devastationwhich extends across the river Elster.Some of this damage may have been caused by the VIII Air Force attacks on 17th. 19th, 21st, 26th March and 5th April.Wilhelmshafen. Reconnaissance shows that in the VIII Air Force attackon 30th March considerable damage has been inflicted on buildings in the MarineWerft and in the works of Deutsche Werke A.G. In the former, buildingsinvolved include the lathe shop and joiners&apos; shop, the machine shop, three storesbuildings, a cable-scaling shop, engine-fitting shops and foundry, all of whichhave been destroy-ecl or severely damaged. In the Deutsche Werke A.G, the ship-building workshop, the boiler shop, the electrical shop and the engineering work-shop are among buildings severely affected. Heavy damage has been caused to shipping in the Bauhafen, where the cruiser Koeln is resting on the bottom withsevere structural damage, a Sperrbrecher in dry dock No. 5 is heavily damaged,a 350-foot m/v in dry dock No. 6 is lying on its side, a 410-foot m/v alongside the north, quay is severely damaged and a 300-foot m/v in the new inner harbour and two water-carriers have been sunk.
