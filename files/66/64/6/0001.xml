Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 206.3rd April, 1945.WAR CABINET.ARRANGEMENTS FOR CELEBRATING THE CESSATION OFHOSTILITIES WITH GERMANY.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.I circulate herewith for the apprjval of my colleagues the revised report which the Inter-Departmental Committee on Arrangements for Celebrating the cessation of Hostilities with Germany have submitted following the review oftheir original recommendations which I instructed them to make in pursuance ofthe decision of the Lord President&apos;s Committee (L.P. (45) 17th Meeting,Minute 2).   The Conference recommends (1) that, against the possibility of an early link-up of Soviet and Anglo-American Forces, arrangements should be made for messages to be broadcast by Marshal Stalin, Mr. Roosevelt and the Prime minister when that event takes place;(2) that the cessation of hostilities should be announced by sounding the&quot; All Clear&quot; for three minutes. I think there is much to said fortheir suggestion that, if the timing of the announcement can be fullycontrolled, it should be made at 11 a.m.;(3) that the sounding of the siren should be followed by an announcement by the Prime Minister, followed by a broadcast by The King, or,alternatively, that the Prime Minister should address the nationshortly after the &quot;All Clear&quot; and that The King should broadcast to the Empire later in the day;(4) that some increase in the Underground, bus and suburban services of theMain Line Railways is desirable and that action should be taken inadvance to determine what streets in the centre of London should bebarred to vehicular traffic;(5) that floodlighting should be encouraged on Cease Fire Night and possibly a short time afterwards, that this concession should be limited to localauthorities and public bodies, and that, through the instrumentalityof the Civil Defence Regions, as much use should be made as possible of such lighting material as the Armed Forces can spare, but thatelectric advertisements, Neon signs and shop-window lighting shouldnot be allowed;(6) that the ringing of bells should be encouraged and that the sale offireworks should continue to be prohibited on Cease Fire Day;(7) that, as regards licensed premises, the existing law relating to theextension of hours should continue to operate, but that an announce-ment should be made in advance that the Government hope thatLicensing Authorities would consider sympathetically for Cease Firei Day any advance applications for special orders for that day, and thatadvance information to this effect should be given in confidence toLicensing Authorities and to the Trade;(8) that places of public entertainment should open, but that, while theatres,music halls and cinemas should close on Cease Fire Night at the timenow customary, dance halls should be allowed to remain open to thelatest hour under the Licensing By-law; that local authoritiesshould be asked to include in their summer entertainments campaign[29581] copy No.
2a programme of open-air entertainment on Cease Fire Night; andthat the distributive trades should be invited to open on Cease Fire day and on the second public holiday sufficiently long in order to ensurethat the essential needs in the matter of foodstuffs, &amp;c, of the general public are met;(9) That the proposals about signalling the Cease Fire should becommunicated to the heads of all the churches; that the Sundayfollowing Cease Fire Day should be set aside as a day of Prayer andThanksgiving at which special services should be held in London,Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff; and that if time permits arrange-ments should be made to organise as representative a congregation aspossible at the service at St. Pauls at which it is hoped The Kingwould be present.As to the point which the Conference make about the lining ofThe King&apos;s route, I suggest that part of the route, at anyrate, should be lined and that the guard should, if possible,include representatives of all the Armed Forces, of the Police, andof the uniformed Civil Defence Services, including women.(10) That local victory parades should be organised in connection withThanksgiving Sunday.(11) That an announcement of the Governments proposals should be madeas soon as possible.Subject to the decision of the Cabinet on the question of principle raised in Section IV of the Report (addresses to the nation), I suggest (1) that the Committee&apos;s recommendations be approved;(2) that the appropriate Departments be instructed to proceed immediately to complete the details of the proposals contained in the Report; and(3) that the statement of the Governments Proposals (Appendix) should be. made as soon as possible.BZ. M.Home Office, S.W. 1,3rd April, 1945.
SECOND REPORT OF THE INTERDEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCEON ARRANGEMENTS FOR CELEBRATING THE CESSATION OFHOSTILITIES WITH GERMANY.I. Introduction.The Conference, consisting of representatives of the Home Office, Treasury,Scottish Office, Ministry of War Transport and Ministry of Information, has,in pursuance of the Home Secretary&apos;s instructions, reviewed, in the light ofexisting circumstances and of the views of the Lord Presidents Committee on certain points of principle submitted to them (L.P. (45) 17th Meeting, Minute 2),the recommendations made in the report appended to L.P. (44) 175.In submitting revised proposals the Conference has assumed that these would, if approved by Ministers, be remitted to the appropriate Departments for implementation.II. Celebration of the Meeting of Soviet and Anglo-American Forces.It may well happen that the Anglo-American Armies will join hands withthe Soviet Armies before an Armistice or a declaration that organised resistanceis at an end. When this happens it is possible that there will be a spontaneousoutburst of public rejoicing, perhaps taking the form of large crowds gatheringin the streets to acclaim the impending victory. Whether these rejoicings are on agreat or small scale the Conference thinks the link-up would be the appropriateoccasion to broadcast messages by Marshal Stalin, Mr. Roosevelt and the PrimeMinister in celebration of the victories of the three main Allies. In this waythe point raised in the Lord Presidents Committee on the 23rd March, that inacclaiming the successful war effort of the Commonwealth we should not appearto overlook the part played by Russia and the U.S.A., would be met, without having to include references to all the United Nations. If this suggestion be approved it would be for the Foreign Office and the Ministry of information to make the necessary arrangements : the latter Department would also ask theB.B.C. to introduce some appropriate special features into its programme forthat day.It is not contemplated that any special arrangements to celebrate the occasionwould be made by the Government.III. Announcement of the Cessation of Hostilities.The Air Raid warning system is the best device for mailing known rapidly,generally and simultaneously throughout the country the termination of hostilities-ties. The Conference recommends that &quot; Cease Fire &quot; should be signalled by thesounding of the &quot; All Clear &quot; for three minutes. The Ministry of Home Securityshould make the necessary arrangements to that end now, including the broad-casting of the sirens over the wireless. It would be necessary for the War cabinet office to instruct the Ministry of Home Security War Room when the signal wasto be given. It is not essential that the announcement should coincide with the cessation of hostilities. The Conference would not .suggest that the signal shouldbe given between midnight and 6 a.m. should hostilities cease during that period :it could be given later in the day. If it is possible for the timing of the announce-ment to be controlled there is much to be said in favour of making it at 11 a.m.IV. Addresses to the Nation.Two alternative methods are submitted for the consideration of Ministers,on. the assumption that the announcement of the cessation of hostilities is an executive act to be performed by the Prime Minister. First, at 15 or 30 minutesafter the sounding of the &quot; All Clear,&quot; the Prime Minister might announce shortlythe cessation of hostilities and introduce The King, who would then broadcast to His People. The Prime Minister might broadcast an address to the country on the following day or on the evening of Thanksgiving Sunday. Alternatively,the Prime Minister might, very shortly after the &quot; All Clear,&quot; make an address[295811 b 2
to the Nation in which he might indicate the Governments views as to the spiritin which the conclusion of hostilities should be celebrated, while The King mightbroadcast in the evening. The experience of the B.B.C. is that 9 p.m. is the hourwith the largest listening audience : but it may well happen that on &quot; CeaseFire &quot; night the listening&quot;public will not be nearly as large as normal.The Conference suggests that an announcement should be made before&quot; Cease Fire &quot; day that the &quot; Cease Fire &quot; will be signalled by the sounding ofa final &quot; All Clear &quot; for three minutes and that The King and the Prime minister will broadcast at certain times. It will be for the Ministry .of Information toget the B.B.C. to make the necessary arrangements for the broadcasts. ,)The Conference feels that as &quot;Cease Fire &quot; will probably come during the spring or summer there will, &apos;in all probability, not be the same interest takenin this country in an inter-Empire broadcast as there would be during the winter months. They would not. therefore, wish to urge that arrangements should be specially made for such a &quot;hook-up&quot; on &quot; Cease Fire&quot; day. One should bearranged for as soon as possible afterwards, possibly on Thanksgiving Sunday.V. Transport.In considering the arrangements for the celebration of the occasion by thegeneral public, the factor which has weighed most with the Conference has beenthe transport situation both in London and in the Provinces, and the problem which will confront the police if large numbers of people are left strandedat night.In the Metropolis the London Passenger Transport Board is short of personnel, and much of the staff employed on buses and on the undergroundstations is female. All are tired and suffering from strain of war. Crowdswill undoubtedly throng the centre of London and will congregate round such places as Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square. In the interests of law andorder it is essential that steps should be taken to provide some transport to takepeople part, if not the whole, of the way home. The problem which will confrontthe London Passenger Transport Board will be considerable. The Conferenceunderstands that they will endeavour to run augmented and later services, bothroad and rail, but the extent to which this can be clone will depend not only onthe notice they receive but also on the reactions of the staff. It will be easier toincrease underground services than road services. Some increase of the suburbanservices of the main line railways would be desirable.It is desirable that certain streets in the centre of the Capital which arelikely to be thronged with people should be barred to all vehicular traffic and itis recommended that the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis should consult with the London Passenger Transport Board and determine in advance whichstreets should be so restricted.The transport situation in the Provinces is equally difficult, but thepossibilities are more uncertain and vary from place to place. The Conferencesuggests, however, that it would be desirable for services in the larger centres tobe augmented and later services provided, to the extent to which that is practicable, having regard to the man-power available and the reactions of thestaff. If this is to be done it will be necessary for the Ministry of War transport to advise operators in advance that these additional services should be providedwhere needed and so far as practicable and that the fuel required for the purpose will be authorised.VI. Lighting and Illumination.The need and the scope for additional lighting and illumination will notbe as great and striking as they would have been had &quot; Cease Fire&quot; occurred during the winter. The Ministry of Fuel and Power point out that it is still necessary to conserve fuel, not to add to the burden of gas and electricity under-takings, and to take no step which will make more difficult the maintenance ofsuch restrictions on fuel consumption as the supply situation will make necessary.There is the further consideration that shortages of labour and material wouldmake it a matter of very great difficulty to try to prepare street lighting installa-tions in time. For these reasons the Lord Presidents Committee have already decided (L.P. (45) 17th Meeting, Minute 2) that full-scale street lighting shouldnot be restored even for &quot; Cease Fire &quot; night. They have, however, approved that,subject to considerations of fuel and economy, every encouragement should begiven to plans for floodlighting during a short&apos;period&quot;of celebration
The Conference suggests that this floodlighting should not be limited to theCapital, but that it should be stated that, bearing in mind the need for fuel economy, the Government would not wish to raise any objection to the use by localauthorities on &quot; Cease Fire &quot; night and the following night of floodlightingfacilities where they exist and can be brought into use. It is suggested that the concession be limited to local authorities and public bodies. Electric advertise-ments, neon signs and shop-window lighting, the use of which is now prohibited,should not in any case be allowed.The Conference understands that the Armed Forces have some lightingmaterial in the form of searchlights, portable lights, &amp;c, which could be used forilluminations. The assistance to be obtained from this source is limited, as thenumber of searchlights now in use has been much reduced and they must beretained in their present sites, which are generally in isolated areas, until theactual moment of &apos;&apos; Cease Fire &apos;&apos;; trained personnel are necessary for their opera-tion and maintenance. The lack of trained personnel and transport difficultiesmay also prevent the use of any substantial part of the equipment now in store.The amount of portable equipment that could be utilised in floodlighting townsis not likely tb be great. Subject to these limitations the Conference suggests thatthe maximum use be made of&quot; such equipment as is available, and that, as it isdispersed throughout the country, arrangements for its use will have to bedecentralised. The most expeditious way to do this will probably be to use theCivil Defence Region with its Service Liaison Officers. The Ministry of Workswould, of course, be responsible for floodlighting Government buildings.VII. Gun Salutes, Maroons, Bells.The Lord Presidents Committee have decided that the return of peace inEurope should be signalised by the ringing of bells and not by the firing of gunsor maroons (L.P. (45) 17th Meeting, Minute 2). The letting off of fireworks in athoroughfare is already an offence under the Explosives Act, .1875. The s-ale offireworks is prohibited under the Defence Regulations : the Conference suggeststhat this prohibition should continue to operate on &quot; Cease Fire &quot; day.VIII. Licensed Premises: Extension of Hours.Under the Licensing Acts licensed hours can only be extended by SpecialOrders of Exemption granted in London by Lire Commissioners of Police of the metropolis and the City, in England and Wales by the Petty Sessional Justices,and in Scotland by two members of the Licensing Court, for a &quot; special occasion &quot;or &quot; occasions &quot; after application by the individual licence holder. Under thearrangements in force in the Metropolis such applications can be expeditiouslydealt with. In other parts of the country, however, the licensing authority requirecertain periods of notice to be given before they are prepared to entertain anapplication for a special order. The grant of a special order is a matter entirelywithin the discretion of these authorities, from whose decision there is no appeal.The existing law relating to applications for special orders of extensioncannot, the Conference is advised, be altered by means of a Defence Regulation.It seems probable that there will be a public demand for an extension of per-mitted hours. In a few weeks there will be an increasing gap between the normalclosing hour and the onset of darkness. If there are to be illuminations there ismuch to be said for keeping the public houses open until the illuminations begin.Furthermore, it would be important to avoid, as far as possible, granting exten-sions to restaurants which, were denied to other types of licensed premises. Onthe other hand the Temperance interests will, be hostile to any extension oflicensed hours and it is unlikely that additional supplies of beer can be madeavailable. Representations have been made to the Home Office that stocks of liquor in public houses will not suffice to meet extended hours on two public holidays.In all the circumstances it does not seem necessary to consider whether theexisting law relating to applications for special orders of exemption should be&quot;altered. The Conference suggests that the afternoon break should be maintained on &quot;Cease Fire&quot; day and that, as regards evening extensions, the existing machinery under which local licensing authorities have a discretion to grantextensions should be used. As some central guidance will no doubt be expected,it is suggested&apos; that, either in Answer to a Question expressly directed tothe point or in the course of a reply to a Question as to the general arrangements proposed  by  the  Government,  it  should  be  announced   that
the Government think that the licensing authority should for &quot; Cease Fire &quot;day only consider sympathetically, in the light of local opinion, advance applica-tions for special orders in respect of the day on which hostilities with germany are officially declared to have ceased. It would be most desirable to give licensing authorities and the trade confidential guidance forthwith and it is hoped that ministers will agree to this being; done bv the Home Office and the Scottish office in advance of the suggested public statement.IX. Public Entertainment.The Conference suggests in Section V above that, on transport grounds, thecongregation of large crowds on &quot; Cease Fire &quot; night should not be encouraged.To this end facilities for orderly indoor entertainment are desirable, and themore such places that are available the better. The Conference does not, however,suggest that theatres, music halls and cinemas should remain open later thanthe hours prevailing before &quot;Cease Fire&quot; day; but they do recommend thatplaces licensed for music and dancing by the public might remain open later,and that the Home Office and Scottish Office should encourage authorities whichlicense such places to indicate in advance to licensees that on &quot; Cease Fire &quot;night no exception will be taken to the prolongation of the entertainment tothe latest hour permitted on the late night under the licence or the relative bye-lav,-. The Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Information have encouragedlocal authorities to organise &quot;Summer Entertainments&quot; this year. It seemsto the Conference that it would be a good thing to ask local authorities toinclude in their jDlans a programme of open air entertainment in the local parkor open space on &quot; Cease Fire &quot; evening.X.--Shops.It is understood that the plans for a public holiday in celebration of the defeat of Germany provide for a holiday on &quot;Cease Fire&quot; day and on theday following. If &quot;Cease Fire&quot; occurred immediately before or after theend of the week the reduction of shopping facilities which would result from ageneral holiday would cause serious inconvenience to the general public. Inany case, the Home Office and the Scottish Office should suggest to the appropriatetrade associations the desirability of shops dealing in food-stuffs and otherimmediate requirements of the public remaining open on both &quot; Cease Fire &quot;day and the following day (or the next Monday if &quot; Cease Fire &quot; is announced on Saturday) sufficiently long to enable the essential needs of the general public to be met.XL Religious Celebrations.(a) Local Services.The Archbishop of Canterbury is very anxious to know the manner in whichthe cessation of hostilities will be notified. It is understood that all denomination-tions are anxious to make plans so that thanksgiving services may be held assoon as possible after the cessation of hostilities is announced. Among a large part of the people there will no doubt be a desire to go to Church on &quot; CeaseFire &apos;&apos; day. The Conference suggests that the Home Office and the scottish office should inform the heads of the various denominations that a special signal,particulars of which will be announced in due time, will be used so that theymay make their plans accordingly to be ready to have the Churches open andto hold services, for those who desire to go to Church.(b) Broadcast Services.On the assumption that &quot; Cease Fire &quot; is announced before noon, the B.B.C.have included in their draft programme for that day a short religious serviceimmediately after the announcement and an interdenominational Service ofThanksgiving in the evening.(c) Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving.The Conference suggests -that the Sunday immediately after &quot; Cease Fire&quot;day should be set aside as a Day of Prayer and Thanksgiving and that an earlyintimation should be given of The King&apos;s pleasure that it should be so observed.It is understood that the Archbishop of Canterbury has already prepared a formof service for use in the Church of England on that occasion.   The Home Office
1-1iand the Scottish Office are receiving enquiries from religious denominations onthe subject, and it is important that The King&apos;s wishes should be announced as early as possible.The Conference recommends that on Thanksgiving Sunday there should bespecial services in London and Edinburgh and possibly also at Cardiff and Belfast,and ventures to hope that it would accord with The King&apos;s convenience to attend the special Service in London and that it would be possible for His Majesty tobQ. represented by Members of the Royal Family at the other Services.If &quot; Cease Fire &quot; were announced not later than, say, noon on Thursday theConference suggests, for the consideration of Ministers, that arrangements shouldbe made for as representative a congregation as possible to be present in St. PauhsCathedral on Thanksgiving Sunday.Should this proposal commend itself to Ministers the Home Office should proceed without delay to complete in advance the necessary arrangements inconsultation with other interested Departments; and that the Scottish office should make similar arrangements for the Service in Edinburgh.If &quot; Cease Fire &quot; is announced late on Thursday or on Friday or Saturdaytime would, it is suggested, not permit such arrangements to be made for thefollowing Sunday. In that case the Cabinet, the Diplomatic Corps, the high commissioners, and the Heads of the Fighting Services, should be given specialplaces in the Cathedral, the rest of which would be open to the general public.This is broadly what happened on Wednesday, the 12th November, 1918, whenKing George V attended a Service of Thanksgiving at St. paul&apos;s Cathedral.The Home Secretary would no doubt communicate with the Lord Mayor ofCardiff and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland asking them to be responsiblefor the Services in Cardiff and Belfast.During the war, whenever The King has attended special Services ofThanksgiving it has not been possible, for security reasons, to announce inadvance that His Majesty was to be present. On Thanksgiving Sunday it willbe known that The King proposes to attend the special Service. The question arises whether arrangements should be made for the streets to be lined throughoutthe course of His Majesty&apos;s route. The Conference understands that the numberof troops in London District would be totally inadequate to line the route fromthe Palace to the Cathedral. It would no doubt be the wish of Ministers that the route should be lined if not from Temple Bar, at any rate from Ludgate Circus.If Their Majesties were to travel in an open car, assuming weather conditions to be favourable, the people of the Metropolis would be given the greatest pleasure.XII.  Victory Parades.To celebrate victory in Europe local authorities should be encouraged toorganise local parades of members of the Armed Forces, the Civil defence services, Youth organisations and war workers of all categories, preferably tobe held on Thanksgiving Sunday either in connection with the local Thanks-giving Service or in the afternoon.The Conference presumes that there will be no national victory parade until after the final defeat of the Axis Powells.XIII. Necessity for Announcement of Government Views.Local Authorities and other bodies are already planning arrangements forthe celebration of &quot; Cease Fire &quot; in their respective localities and by theirrespective interests, and requests for guidance and information are alreadyreaching Government Departments. The Conference thinks it important thatsome indication of the views of the Government should be given as soon as possible if only to avoid excessive celebrations inconsistent with the Government&apos;s plans and wishes, and it is suggested that this could best be done by means of a statement in the House of Commons on the lines of the draft contained in the Appendix.If developments in the war situation made a Government pronouncementnecessary before the end of the Recess, it would be issued as a press notice.Home Office, S.W. 1,31st March, 1945.
APPENDIX.Draft Answer to a Question asking for a Statement on the governments plans for Celebrating the Defeat of Germany.Yes Sir. His Majesty&apos;s Government have drawn up certain plans to celebratethe defeat of Germany, whether that arises out of an Armistice or from the cessation of organised hostilities.The news will be signalled by the sounding throughout the country of a final&quot;All Clear&quot; on the Air Raid Warning system lasting for three minutes.[Fifteen] [Thirty] minutes afterwards the Prime Minister will make anannouncement on the wireless and His Majesty The King will then address his people throughout the world.Alternatively: [Fifteen] [Thirty] minutes afterwards the Prime Minister -will speak to the Nation over the wireless : at 9 p.m. His Majesty The King willaddress His People throughout the world.We hope that, during the day, Church bells will be rung everywhere. It willbe the wish of many forthwith to give thanks to God for Victory and Churchesof all denominations will no doubt be opened without delay. His majesty the King has authorised me to say that he would wish the Sunday afterCease Fire day to be observed as a day of prayer and thanksgiving, and that itit is His Majesty&apos;s intention to attend a special service at St. Pauks Cathedral onthat day. Similar special services will be held on that day in Edinburgh. belfast and Cardiff at which His Majesty hopes to be represented.As to Cease Fire Day. His Majesty&apos;s Government hope that places of publicentertainment will remain open and, in the case of premises licensed for dancing,they suggest that licensing authorities should tell licensees that no objectionwill be raised to the premises remaining open until the latest hour permitted under the licence or byelaw. It is hopecl that local authorities will make fullyavailable during the evening the open air entertainments arranged as part oftheir Summer Entertainments programme.The House will be aware that the need for fuel economy remains as acute asever, and, while it will no doubt be the general wish that as much light as possible should be available on Cease Fire night, the Government regret that they cannot agree to the restoration, even for that night, of street, display, or shopwindowlighting. They will not, however, raise any objection to the use by local authoritiesand public bodies on that night [ ? and the succeeding night] of floodlightingfacilities where they exist and can be brought into use. The Ministry of works will arrange for the floodlighting of important Government Buildings. Inaddition the Service Ministers have agreed to make available for illuminationssuch lighting devices as searchlights and portable floodlights as can be spared.The extent of this assistance, which is limited by operational considerations andthe shortage of trained personnel, is not likely to be considerable : its use willbe co-ordinated through the Regional Commissioners. The Boy ScoutsAssociation is arranging a certain number of bonfires.As to licensed premises, the Government propose to leave the decision as toextensions of licensing hours to the licensing authorities, but suggest that theyshould consider sympathetically, in accordance with the ordinary law and in thelight of local circumstances, advance applications for special orders of exemptionor special permissions in respect of the day on which hostilities with Germany areofficially declared to have ceased.[Announce (or refer to) duration of public holiday.] The Government are confident that, as on other public holidays, they may rely on the public spiritof shopkeepers and their staffs to open during the holiday for such period asis necessary to enable the essential needs of the public to be met.Local authorities will be asked to arrange on Thanksgiving Sunday localvictory parades in which members of the Armed Forces, the Civil defence services, the Youth Organisations and war workers of all categories will take part.
