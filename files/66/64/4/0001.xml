THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. v popy No.W.P. (45) 294. .      WBOth March. 1945.YYAR GABINET.PROCEDURE IN TRIALS FOR HIGH TREASON.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary ofState for, Scotland.THE law relating to procedure in trials for high treason is embodied in anumber of statutes, of which the principal is the Treason Act, 1695, and the lastare the. Treason Acts, 1800 and 1842. These last two Acts provide that, in easesin which the overt act or acts of treason alleged in the indictment are againstThe King&apos;s life or person, the procedure should be the same in all respects as intrials for murder.2. In all other cases of treason a special procedure is prescribed. Apartfrom such questions as the giving of notices to the accused, the right of challengeof jurors, and other variations in the formalities before trial, the following rulesare peculiar to trials for treason : (1) No person may be convicted of treason or misprison of treason exceptupon the evidence of two witnesses, both of them to the same overt act,or one of them to one, and another of them to another of the sametreason, unless the accused pleads guilty or refuses to plead, orperemptorily challenges above the number of 35 of the jury.(2) No evidence may be given of any overt act that is not expressed in theindictment.(3) In cases of treasons committed in England and Wales it is necessary to prove that one of the overt acts alleged was committed within theCounty for which the Court has jurisdiction, though when this hasbeen done evidence can be given of other acts committed elsewhere.These peculiar rules of pleading and evidence necessitate a high degree ofelaboration, in the indictment, and have led to much technical argument as toadmissibility of evidence.In particular, the requirement that there must be two witnesses to an overtact of treason may create serious difficulties in practice, as under modern conditions the evidence of the overt acts in many cases will be documentary. Forexample, in a recent case in which a person was prosecuted to conviction under regulation 2A of the Defence (General) Regulations of doing acts likely to assistthe enemy, by preparing scripts and records for enemy broadcasts, the evidenceof the acts charged, which was overwhelming, was entirely documentary exceptfor that of one engineer from Radio Paris who identified the accused as a person who had made recordings. Under the existing law it would not have been possibleto indict this man for treason without another witness, whom it might have been impossible to procure, to an overt act of treason.3. In cases of treason committed abroad the indictment must be laid in thecounty of the County of London and the County of Middlesex, and, although thepoint is doubtful, it is possible that the law requires the preferment of a Bill ofIndictment before a Grand Jury, an institution which was abolished for ordinarycriminal trials in 1933. An indictment found by the Grand Jury of the county of London and County of Middlesex must be tried in the King&apos;s Bench Divisionof the High Court unless, upon application made by notice of motion to adivisional court of the King&apos;s Bench Division, the High Court directs that it[29552]
shall be tried at the Central Criminal Court either in the ordinary way or beforethree Judges of the King&apos;s Bench Division.It would seem unnecessary to have this special provision in cases of treasonbecause in any criminal cause it is open to the Crown or to the accused to applyto the High Court for trial at bar, so that it is always possible in a case of exceptional importance or difficulty to have a trial before three Judges of theKing&apos;s Bench Division.4. The special provisions as to procedure in the law relating to trials fortreason are safeguards which it was thought necessary to provide against abusesat a time when the Acts were passed, and most of them derive from the Act of1695, which was intended tQ secure that there should be no recurrence of thescandalous miscarriages of justice which had recently taken place in connectionwith the Popish Plot and the Rye House Conspiracy. Such of these provisionsas have not now been incorporated in the ordinary criminal procedure are merelyantiquated survivals which add little or nothing to the dignity or solemnity ofthe trial. The procedure and rules of evidence now in use in criminal trials inthis country are admitted to be the fairest in the world, and it can scarcely becontended that this procedure and these rules, which have been thoughtappropriate in trials for treason against The King&apos;s person, and for the purposeof the Treachery Act, 1940, are not adequate for all other treason trials.5. The matter is of immediate importance because the special procedure atpresent prescribed may well prove a hindrance to the speedy and effective prosecu-tion for treason of British subjects who may come into the hands of theauthorities as the occupation of Germany proceeds. The Director of&apos; public prosecutions has. therefore, represented that, following the precedent of theTreason Acts, 1800 and 1840, legislation should be introduced to provide that all forms of treason should be indicted, arraigned, tried and attainted according tothe same course and order of trial and upon the like evidence as in the case of murder. The Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General are both in agreementwith this- proposal, and we accordingly ask for the authority of our colleagues for the preparation of a Bill for this purpose with a view to its introduction assoon as possible.6. It is proposed to provide that the new statute operates as from the3rd September, 1939. While there is, in general, great objection to making a criminal statute retrospective, the present proposal is solely concerned withprocedure it does not seek to alter the substance of the law of treason in anyway and the purpose of the Bill is to simplify procedure by removing archaismsin the cases of treason arising in or out of the present war.7. The foregoing paragraphs of this Memorandum are concerned with theposition in England and Wales. In Scotland the law of treason is the same asin England and Wales, and the procedure in cases other than those covered bythe Treason Act of 1800 is also similar to the procedure in England and Wales.It is proposed to provide in the Bill that in the trial of cases of treason of allkinds the procedure to be followed by the Scottish Courts will be that which wouldbe followed under Scots law in cases of murder.H. M.T. J.Whitehall S.W.1, 30th March, 1945.
