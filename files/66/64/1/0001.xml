Pacific.12. Preceded by attacks by aircraft of the U.S. Fleet on the 23rd and 24th,U.S. amphibious forces landed on four of the Kerama Islands in the OkinawaGroup between Formosa and Japan on the 26th, and by mid-day two of the islands had been captured.A convoy of eight Japanese ships including five warships was sunk by .S. carrier-borne aircraft off the Ryukyu Islands, and in operations betweenthe 25th and 28th U.S. warships seriously damaged more than 17 enemy shipsincluding three destroyers.   In addition 37 Japanese aircraft were- destroyed.Islands in the Kuriles and Bonins were heavily attacked by carrier-borne aircraft and the islands held by the enemy in the Marshalls were attacked by naval aircraft.Allied warships sustained damage by enemy air attacks.Philippines.13. Ventura aircraft sank two small U-boats off Cebu, and light craftdamaged and probably sank a U-boat which was attempting to escape from Cebuharbour.   Venturas destroyed two midgets in Davao Gulf (S.K. Mindanao).Anti-Submarine Operations.14. During the week 29 attacks on U-boats were reported, of which 15 wereby shore-based aircraft and 14 by warships.On the 20th H.M.C.S.

A berdeen (sloop) S.E. of Cape Verde Islands on the 15th.Coastal Command aircraft have made a number of attacks on surfacedU-boats off Bornholm during two offensive sweeps into the western Baltic.Enemy Intelligence.15. The last reconnaissance of Gdynia, previous to its capture by theRussians, showed that the Gneisenau had been moved from her usual berth; theonly other heavy ship present was the old battleship Sehleswig-Holstein whichhad previously been damaged. A target ship, a torpedo boat, four cargo ships and a whale oil factory ship were also seen. The Lutzoto, Eugen and Leipzig have moved to Puck Bay 25 miles north of Gdynia. Lutzow is reported to have beenbombarding in support of the German armies. Between Gdynia and Hela a destroyer, five torpedo boats, ten minesweepers, six escort ships, three sperr-brechers, an E-boat depot ship, 15 small craft, and 15 cargo ships were seen underway. Scheer, Hipper and Emden were seen at Kiel on the 21st and Niirnbergwas at Copenhagen on the 23rd.U-boats.16. There is no appreciable change in the U-boat dispositions. reports indicate that serious mechanical defects have been experienced in the new typeU-boats which have prevented their employment up to the present. It is doubtfulwhether any of the bigger boats of the new type has left the Baltic, thoughprobably a few of the smaller new boats are now operative.Enemy Attack on Shipping.17. During the week five ships are reported to have been sunk totalling23,000 tons.Two ships in Channel convoys were sunk by U-boats off the south coast of cornwall and a midget sank a ship in convoy off Margate. Two ships in convoy from Antwerp were mined and sunk off Zeebrugge, and a Norwegian tanker ina westbound convoy was mined or torpedoed in the same area and was takenin tow.Allied Minelaying.18.   Surface craft have laid a large number of mines in Home Waters.Aircraft have laid mines in the approaches to Oslo and in the Elbe.[29537] y;
Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.19. Minelaying by E-boats probably tools: place on three nights off the east coast and in the Scheldt approaches, where 20 mines have been destroyed duringthe week.The mine totals are 6,475 ground and 9,512 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.20. It is reported that the German s.s. Steuben (14,660 tons) has heentorpedoed and sunk off Rixhoft (N.W. of Hela) while carrying refugees fromPillau.MILITARY SITUATIONWestern Europe.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.21. In the south the Seventh U.S. Army have reached the Rhine and established a firm bridgehead between Mannheim and Gernsheim. The ThirdU.S. Army have cleared the remaining enemy resistance west of the Rhine andthrust forward across the river to reach Aschaffenburg and Frankfurt.Armoured columns have driven northwards to reach Friedberg. A further bridge-head secured south of Coblenz is being rapidly expanded eastwards.Armoured forces of the First U.S. Army have broken out of the Remagenbridgehead and advanced up to 35 miles on a wide front east and S.E. Forwardelements have reached Wetzlar and are approaching Wiesbaden.In the north the Ninth U.S. and Second British Armies have established themselves across the Rhine and are making good progress on a front of 25 milesbetween Duisbourg and Emmerich.Southern Sector.22. The capture of Zweibrucken by the Seventh U.S. Army on the 21stand the subsequent linking-up with the Third U.S. Army at Homburg, resultedin the Siegfried defences being rapidly rolled up from west to east. On the 22ndPirmasens, the last important road centre west of the Rhine was enteredunopposed, while by the 24th advanced elements were in Speyer, thus joining up with troops of the Third U.S. Army. Enemy resistance west of the Rhine ceasedon the 25th and on the night of the 25th/26tb the Seventh U.S. Army securedcrossings over the river on a wide front north and south of Worms. This bridge-head has been expanded against little resistance and extends to a depth of15 miles from Mannheim northwards, to a junction point with the Third U.S.Army bridgehead established east of Oppenheim.Central Sector.23. The Third U.S. Army&apos;s S.E. drive reached Ludwigshafen on the 22nd.and the advance to close the Rhine throughout the Army Sector was completed by the 24th. Full advantage was taken of the confusion into which the enemy had been thrown by the quick turn of events south of the Moselle; crossings overthe Rhine were secured south of Mainz on the night of the 22nd/23rd and within48 hours had formed a bridgehead 10 miles long with a maximum depth of 5 miles.Armoured forces drove eastwards from the bridgehead and reached the line ofthe Main between Aschaffenburg and Hanau on the 25th, while a further drivecleared Landau and reached the southern outskirts of Frankfurt a day later.On the 27th armoured columns struck northwards across the river Mainbetween Frankfurt and Flanau and leading troops have reached Friedberg.During the 25th/26th, a second bridgehead was established by the ThirdU.S. Army south of Coblenz between St. Goar and Boppard. This bridgeheadhas leached a depth of 8 miles and has linked up with the Fh^st U.S. Army&apos;sthrust from the Remagen bridgehead S.W. of Limburg.Despite the enemy&apos;s efforts to contain the Remagen bridgehead, the FirstLT.S. Army steadily increased its hold on the east bank of the Rhine. On the25th CJ.S. armoured forces broke through the enemy&apos;s defences and drove eastand S.E. on a wide front. Limburg was captured on the 26th and leadingelements have advanced up to 35 miles to reach Wetzlar, while a further driveS.E. is approaching Wiesbaden.
Northern Sector.24. Following a period of intense preparation and regrouping, the NinthU.S. and Second British Armies launched their assault across the Rhine on the night of the 23rd/24th. The attack was delivered on a front stretching from.E. of Rheinberg to north of Rees and was preceded by heavy artillery andbomber attacks. Footholds were rapidly gained on the far bank and on the morning of the 24th two airborne divisions were successfully dropped north ofWesel. These airborne forces captured bridges over the River Ijssel and linked up with the ground troops within a few hours. By the 25th a firm hold had beenestablished on a front of 25 miles. On the right the Ninth u.s.. Army pressed forward east of Dorsten, while in the centre the Second British Army were15 miles east of Wesel and had cleared Hal tern and Borken. On the leftresistance has been fierce but British troops have cleared Rees and are steadilyforcing the enemy back. Isselburg was captured on the 28th and on the extremeleft of the front, forward troops are on the outskirts of Emmerich.Russian Front.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Latvia.25. The lull in the fighting in Latvia was broken by renewed Russian attackseast of Libau on the 25th. The Germans, however, reported these attacks asfailures on the following day.Northern Sector.26. Since the capture of Braunsberg Last week, the Russians have madesteady progress in East Prussia in the area S.W. of Koenigsberg. Along the inner coastline of the Frisches Haff operations have entered the mopping-up stage.Heavy fighting continues in the Danzig-Gdynia area, which was cut in twoon the 23rd by the capture of Zoppot on the coast. The Russians capturedGdvnia on the 28th and claimed to have reached the centre of Danzis;.Central Sector.27. On the 24th the Russians reported the capture of Neisse and a town30 miles to the S.E. Since then, the area of penetration has been extended bythe capture of a town 14 miles south of Breslau. Further south the russians have made progress in the area south of Gleiwitz in the direction of theMoravska Ostrava gap.Southern Sector.28. In the Slovakian Mountains steady pressure brought the Russians upto Banska Bystrica from the south and S.E., and the town was taken on the 26th.The Russians are reported by the Germans to have enlarged their bridge-head over the River Hron, west of Levice on the 27th but there is, as yet, no confirmation from our Allies of a Russian offensive in this area.In the advance of 44 miles on a 60-mile front north of Lake Balatonannounced on the 24th, the Russians took Szekesfehervar and continued 25 miles.E. of Gyor. On the next day, in the area immediately south of the RiverDanube, the Russians announced the capture of Esztergom and an advancewestward of 25 miles. The Russians have also advanced down the west shore of Lake Balaton for about two-thirds of its length.The important railway junction of Gyor was captured on the 28th and inthe area N.W. of Lake Balaton their advance was kept up on a broad front.Papa was captured on the 26th, and west and N.W. of Papa the Russians arenow across the River Raba.On the 23rd the Germans were forced to abandon the second of the twobridgeheads which they had won across the River Drava, doubtless as part oftheir abortive counter-offensive in Hungary. With the Russian drive betweenthe Danube and Lake Balaton now in full swing, the Russians have completelyturned the tables on the enemy.Burma,29. In the Arakan leading troops of the column advancing south from the bridgehead north of Taungup, have reached a point 5 miles north of Taungup.In Central Burma, heavy fighting continues in the area N.W. of Chauk,and several enemy counter-attacks have been repulsed.[29537] b 2
On the 22nd, following an unsuccessful enemy counter-attack, our troopsoccupied Myingyang and its airstrip to the north, while other troops advancingfrom the north, have opened the road between Myotha and Myingyang.In the Meiktila area, the enemy is directing his main effort in attempts toneutralise the airstrips. The centre of the main airfield was still held by theJapanese on the 27th. A Japanese attack against our defences on the 22nd/23rdwas repulsed, the enemy leaving behind 215 dead. Our patrols continue to clear villages to the north, east and south of Meiktila.The small enemy parties that remain in Mandalay are now being cleared, andthe remnants of the Japanese troops in this area are withdrawing south of theMyifnge River.On the 20th, a brigade thrusting south from the area west of Kyauksecaptured Pindale, 20 miles north of Meiktila, and on the 21st an armoured column of the same brigade captured Wundwin against strong opposition. Turning N.E.these troops have now captured Mytttha, 13 miles south of Kyaukse and are within miles of other troops advancing from the north.In Northern Burma our troops advancing from Mogok captured Mongiong,12 miles to the S.E. on the 22nd, and have now advanced a further 15 miles towardsKyaukree.Chinese troops advancing down the road west of Hsipaw engaged enemy forces 10 miles S.W. of the town on the 21st. Other troops are in contact with theenemy, 7 miles S.E. of Hsipaw.Other Chinese troops have also advanced 38 miles south of Lash I o and are within one mile of Mongyai.French Indo-China.30. French troops in the Moncay area, who held out until the 21st, have been forced to withdraw into China, but Catba Island, in the Gulf of Ton king offHaiphong.-remains in French hands.French troops estimated at 600-700 are being contained in the mountainousregions north and N.W. of Tonking and North Laos.The Japanese, who have taken up positions covering their lines of communi-cation China/Indo-China/Siam, are now beginning to threaten the main Frenchconcentrations.China,31. No major changes have been reported during the week from theITengyang area, but the Japanese west of the Peiping-Hankow Railway havemade two thrusts from the north and south ends of the Honan salient. The U.S.airfield at Laohokou was reached on the 26th by Japanese troops advancing fromthe N.E. and leading elements of this drive are some 50 miles distant from otherforces advancing on Siangyang from the S.E.Pacific.Philippines. &quot;32. United States troops are reported to have cleared Balabak Island, justsouth of Palawan. U.S. reconnaissance elements have also landed on Joio andTawi Tawi Islands, which lie to the S.W. of Mindanao.Panay.33. U.S. control over the island is now virtually complete; motorisedpatrols have reached Nabas, Capiz and Balasan on the north coast and San Joseon the west coast without contact.U.S. forces also landed on the Island of Guimaras, between Panav andNegros.  No Japanese were encountered and the U.S. troops returned to Panay.Cebu.34. U.S. forces from Leyte, preceded by a bombardment from Alliedcruisers and destroyers, landed at Talisay on the east coast of Cebu Island on the26th against moderate opposition.
AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.35. Fighter Command flew 216 defensive sorties. Attacks on long-rangeweapon installations are referred to in paragraph 37, while details of rocket and flying bomb activity against this country are reported under &apos;&apos;&apos; Enemy activity and Home Security.&quot;Home Waters.36. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 1,192 sorties; 14 aircraft are missing.Attacks were made on enemy shipping off the Dutch and Norwegian coastsand in the Western Baltic; one 500-ton coaster was sunk, one-R-boat was probably sunk, 3 E-boats, 3 escort vessels and 6 ships totalling 18,500 tons were set on fire, and two destroyers, one armed trawler and 16 ships totalling32,300 tons were damaged.Bomber Command aircraft laid 149 sea-mines.Western Europe.37. In the week ended dawn on the 28th, aircraft of S.H.A.E.F. (Air) flew32,613 sorties and dropped 12,856 tons of bombs. In the week ended dawn onthe 29th, aircraft of Bomber Command and the U.S. VIII Bomber Commandflew 10,355 sorties and dropped 25,522 tons, while Fighter Command and theU.S. VIII Fighter Command flew 5,728 sorties. One hundred and sixty-eightenemy aircraft were destroyed; 238 Allied aircraft are missing, but some ofthese may have landed safely on the Continent.G.A.F. activity was on a small scale, except on the 24th (see below).In the battle areas, Allied aircraft continued to provide close support for allied troops, dropping over 21,000 tons of bombs in widespread attacks oncommunications, transport, troop concentrations, gun positions and supplies;13,000 road and rail vehicles, 530 locomotives and many tanks, A.F.V.s and gun positions are reported to have been destroyed.Between dusk on the 23rd and dusk on the 24th, aircraft based in the UnitedKingdom and Western Europe flew 10,308 sorties (including 1,589 by troop-carrying aircraft), in support of the assault across the Rhine in the Wesel area;1,306 gliders were also employed. An hour after the initial landing on the eastbank of the Rhine, heavy bombers made a concentrated attack on enemy troops and defended positions at Wesel (1,099 tons), followed next day by attacks on17 airfields in Holland and North-West Germany (3,582 tons), troop concen-trations at Gladbeck (548 tons), the railway centre at Sterkrade (554 tons) andflak positions in the battle area (700 tons). In addition, 520 tons of supplies were dropped for airborne troops north-west of Wesel and fighters providedgeneral cover over and around the assault area. During these operations therewas no concentrated air opposition, but a considerable number of small groups of enemy aircraft was encountered in daylight; 54 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and 24 on the ground. Allied losses were 52 troop-carrying aircraft,32 heavy bombers, 3 medium bombers and 33 fighters.Concentrated attacks were made throughout the week on railway andindustrial centres in Central Germany, on which 5,676 tons were dropped.

Attacks were also made on an important railway bridge at Bremen (1,083 tons) and another at Nienburg (33 miles S.E. of Bremen-113 tons). Photographs show that the former was seriously damaged and thelatter partially destroyed.Among other targets bombed were 5 oil plants in the Ruhr area (1,622 tons).2 armament factories in Berlin and one at Plauen (1,602 tons), 4 undergroundoil depots in the Hamburg, Bremen and Brunswick areas (1,100 tons), 5 airfields(1,072 tons) and U-boat shelters near Bremen (154 tons). A third armamentfactory in Berlin was bombed by heavy bombers of the M.A.A.F., which dropped318 tons. Most of these targets were bombed visually, with good results; the others were attacked through cloud, but it is believed that good bombingconcentrations were achieved.
Far East.South-East Asia.40. In the week ended dusk on the 26th. Allied aircraft flew 4,534 sorties,including 2,462 by bombers and fighter-bombers. In addition, Dakota transport aircraft flew 5,626 sorties, carrying 4,343 men and 7,963 tons, and light transport aircraft flew 1,799 sorties carrying 581 men and evacuating 450. Seven allied aircraft are missing.Enemy air activity was on a very low scale; five aircraft were destroyed in combat.The Tactical Air Force continued to give full support to Allied troopsthroughout the battle fronts, successful attacks being made on bridges (of which,over 20 were destroyed or rendered unserviceable) and on enemy troop concentrations.In Lower Burma, 76 Super Fortresses obtained excellent results on Rangoonand Mingaladon (456 tons), and Liberators started a number of fires in theMoulmein area, and destroyed two bridges some 65 miles N.E. of Rangoon.Enemy quarters and supply dumps at Prome and Toungoo were severely damaged by Mitchells and Thunderbolts, while the airfields at Rangoon, Moulmein andTavoy were successfully attacked by Mustangs.In Siam, Liberators released over 200 tons on important rail targets, causingextensive damage to installations, bridges and 20 locomotives.Sea-mining operations were carried out in the Gulf of Martaban, the gulf of Siam and the Straits of Malacca. Liberators sank one 1,500-ton vessel offthe Andaman Islands, and obtained good coverage in an attack on a radar site on great Coco Island (34 tons).China;41. The main targets of the week were in the district of Kaifeng, whereLiberators obtained excellent results in attacks on the railway yards at Tsinanand Chenghsien, and Mustangs destroyed or damaged a number of locomotives.Liberators laid sea-mines in the Yangtze River and damaged 3 vessels in theTongking Gulf.Mosquitoes bombed Berlin on 6 nights of the week, dropping 430 tons, andSpitfires flew 562 sorties against long-^ange weapon installations and roads and railways in Holland.Note. Appendix VII gives raid assessments.Southern Europe.38.&apos; In the week ended dusk on the 26th, aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew17,847 sorties (including 5,518 by heavy bombers) and dropped 14,378 tons of bombs. Forty-three enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and 171 on theground; 113 Allied aircraft, including 65 heavy bombers, are missing.Enemy air activity continued on a small scale.Aircraft of the Strategic Air Force attacked 12 railway centres in Austria(2,106 tons) and 6 in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia (948 tons), largely in support of Russian troops. Attacks were also made on 7 airfields in SouthernGermany and Czechoslovakia (2,261 tons), 5 oil plants in the Vienna and Dresdenareas (1,332 tons) and two armament factories at Prague and at St. Valentin, nearLinz (726 tons).  Results were generally good.Tactical aircraft continued to attack communications, supplies, airfields andother targets in Northern Italy, Yugoslavia and Southern Austria; severalbridges and locomotives and many road and rail vehicles were destroyed or damaged.   At Venice, 4 ships and one torpedo-boat were damaged.Russia.39. The Russian Air Force operated in strength, especially in the Danzigarea and in Hungary. Naval aircraft made several successful attacks on enemy shipping in the Baltic.G.A.F. operations were on a moderate scale and were directed mainly againstconcentrations of Russian armour and M.T. and against the Oder crossings.
Japan.42. On the 18th/19th, 292 Super Fortresses caused devastation over an areaof three square miles in Nagoya (1,679 tons); during this attack the majority ofthe 120 enemy aircraft which were sighted avoided combat. The Mitsubishi aero-engine plant at Nagoya was the target later in the week for a force of221 Super Fortresses, of which 5 failed to return. Results, so far as they couldbe observed, from the 1,480 tons released were excellent.Pacific.43. In the Philippines, close support for Allied troops was maintained; the heaviest concentration was by Liberators which dropped over 130 tons on enemy positions in the Balete Pass. Escorted Liberators also successfully attackedharbour installations at Legaspi (338 tons in two attacks).In preparation for the Allied landing, the Island of Cebu was very heavily attacked by Liberators and Bostons on every day of the week. Corsairs operated in the area of Iloilo (Panay) and Zamboanga (Mindanao).No enemy activity has been reported.In Formosa, Liberators bombed Tainan and Takao, and destroyed both powerplants at Jitsugetsu Lake (129 tons), while the alcohol factory and power plantnear Okayama were very severely damaged by Bostons.Extensive anti-shipping operations in these waters were carried out, in thecourse of which one destroyer and one medium-sized freighter were sunk, andanother destroyer and two large vessels were set on fire off Amoy; over 25 small craft were also either sunk or damaged.In Hainan, 37 Liberators bombed Samah airfield with good results, whileescorted Mitchells attacked the barracks in the vicinity. Mitchells attacked a convoy of seven ships off Camranh Bay (Indo-China); photographs show that two 2,000-ton freighters, two escort vessels and one mine-sweeper were sunk.Targets in the Bismarck Archipelago and on Bougainville were attackeddaily, and small forces operated against targets in the Wewak area including theradar station on Kairiru Island.ENEMY ACTIVITY AND HOME SECURITY.General.44. The nature of enemy activity has been somewhat varied and spasmodic,though the total number of rocket and flying-bombs has been about average. Thenumber of flying-bombs launched, however, has been considerably greater, but,owing to the success of A.A. very few have reached London.Flying-bombs.45. Flying-bombs were launched, few at a time, each day and mostly inthe periods immediately after midnight and after daybreak. A considerablenumber were shot clown by A.A. Defences without causing damage.A number of flying-bombs, penetrating inland, were launched during periodswhen A.A. fire was restricted owing to movements of Allied aircraft, but no major incidents were caused.Of 69 flying-bombs plotted, 44 were destroyed by A. A. fire and 2 by aircraft.There were 27 incidents on land, 5 in London, 16 in Essex, 2 in Kent and oneeach in Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Sussex and Surrey (included in theseincidents were a few flying-bombs shot clown over land).Long-range Rockets.46. There were 32 long-range rocket incidents, 18 in London, 11 in Essex,and one each in Kent, Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire. There was a lull ofsome 21 hours on Sunday and, except for one incident on Tuesday at about 1700,a lull of 48 hours at the end of the period.There was one serious incident on Tuesday morning when 2 five-storey blocks of flats were destroyed and a third block and a hospital seriously damaged.Casualties were, on the latest estimate, 125 killed with rescue&quot; work still proceeding.Except for one incident with 12 killed and one with 7, no other incidentexceeded 5 killed.

Photographs taken on 23rd March show that, as a result of the bomber Command attack on 22nd March, the centre of the town has beendevastated. In the most densely built-up area bounded by the north, south and east walls and Kaiser Friedrichstrasse, no building has been left undamaged.Considerable damage has been inflicted in the railway centre where trackshave been cut in many places and more than 20 wagons damaged or derailed.The goods depot is now more than two-thirds destroyed and the through runninglines have been cut in several places.Of the large number of spinning and weaving plants in the town, whichis a centre of the textile industry, 18 have been destroyed, 13 practically destroyed and six more damaged in varying degree.Bohlen. Smoke from fires still burning furiously in several parts of the synthetic oil plant renders interpretation of photographs taken some twelve hoursafter the Bomber Command attack on 20th/21st March difficult, but it can beseen that damage is severe and widespread. Many important elements havebeen severely damaged and it is unlikely that the plant will be in operation for two to three months.[29537] -      &quot;      c(
Bremew.-Photographs taken on 22nd March show that the bomber command attack on 21st March has caused severe damage to the distillationunit of the Deutsche Vacuum oil refinery.

Hemming stedt. Assessment of damage on photographs taken on 21st Marchafter the 8th Air Force attack on 20th March which was followed immediately by the Bomber Command attack on the night of 20th/21st March is hampered by dense smoke which obscures the northern part of the oil refinery. In the partvisible, however, hits can be seen on that half of the distillation unit which had previously escaped damage and the other distillation unit near the extractionplant has also suffered heavily. It seems probable that no refining will be possiblefor about two months.Hildesheim. -Following the attack by Bomber Command on 22nd March,photographs taken on 23rd March show that, with the exception of the extremesouth-east area around Bismarck Platz and the extreme south-west borderingthe suburb of Mortziberg, almost the entire town area has been destroyed.
