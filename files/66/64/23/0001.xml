Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 223.6th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.GOVERNMENT BUILDING PROGRAMME.BUILDING LABOUR ALLOCATION:   APRIL-JUNE, 1945.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.I have now considered the labour demand and programmes of the various departments for the period April-June 1945.2. The allocations which I now propose are made on the following assumptions : (a) that the European war or war conditions will continue until at least theend of June 1945;(b) that the Ministry of Labour and National Service estimate of a minimumeffective labour force (building and civil engineering) of 517,000 by theend of June 1945 will be substantiated;(Note. Preliminary results of the November census indicate that thelabour force may in fact be somewhat larger, although there isnot jet any evidence as to whether the trend is continuing or thesecretion of permanent value to the Industry).(c) that 140,000 men now on housing repairs in London will be continuedvirtually at this level throughout the period under consideration.3. The attached Statement I shows the agreed estimated total labour available for the period April-June (subject to, the note under 2.(6.) above).Statement II shows the allocations which it is now proposed to make for theperiod. These allocations take account of the fact that the labour force is atleast temporarily in excess of estimates.4. Very full discussions have taken place with the Departments at the interdepartmental Committee of officials under the Chairmanship of theParliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Works.  The total demands exceeded0 the supply of labour by about 10/000.   The Service and Supply Departments, andcertain of the Civil Departments, showed that it would not be possible for themto carry out the whole of their programmes with the proposed allocation. Inthese circumstances, while it was not possible to make specific additional alloca-tions, it was agreed that (i) The Departments* which had shown necessity for increased labour should be allowed a ceiling of 10 per cent, above the proposed alloca-tion, without definite guarantee that the additional labour would beavailable in whole or in any particular part of the country;(ii) The Board of Trade, if unable to proceed with any specific urgentproject on account of its allocation, should be permitted to make aspecial case for such project to be dealt with on its merits.5.   I recommend that the allocations shown in Statement II should be- Ministry of Production,Great George Street.
