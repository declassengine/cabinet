I have also dealt in outline with the alternative of a single TrusteeState for which I share the preference expressed by the Foreign Secretary andthe Minister of State in their comments upon the Report.E. G.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,UK April, 1945.The Future of the British Mandate for Palestine.I. Preliminary.1. I have been asked for my comments on the Cabinet Committee&apos;s recom-mendations for the partition of Palestine and have accordingly set them downwithout reserve. They are the result of constant thought and study since myarrival here three months ago. In the course of that study I have spent many days in making myself familiar with conditions in Palestine at the present time, andhave discussed the subject with all our chief representatives, political, militaryand economic, from Cairo to Baghdad. I have also taken pains to inform myselfon Arab feeling by direct contact with Arab leaders, and with Jewish feelingby conversations with Dr. Weizmann, leading Jews of many types in Palestine,and members of Jewish settlements.2. The Report of the Cabinet Committee recommends partition on theground that Arabs and Jews can never be persuaded to co-operate in the interestsof the country as a whole.  It gives two main reasons for that opinion, namely :  (a) The   incorrigible   defects   of   the   existing   system   of   government(paragraph 4), and(b) The impossibility of establishing any rule to govern Jewish immigrationwhich both communities will accept (paragraph 5).I do not believe myself that these reasons are valid in the conditions which now prevail, although they call for close consideration and certainly cannot be ignored. But before I discuss them at length, I feel bound to state my conviction that partition offers no real solution of the problem which they have set, andalso that it suffers as a policy from serious defects of such a kind as to endangerour whole position in the Middle East.[29582] B
23. The weight of British opinion in the Middle East now shares this view.The Cabinet Committee was supported last year by the then Minister Resident,who had the advantage of sitting with it, and also by the then High Commis-sioner. The present Minister Resident and the present High Commissioner are both opposed to partition. The two Ambassadors remain, as before, of the same opinion and so &quot;do the Commanders-in-Chief. In the Cabinet the foreign secretary and the Minister of State have recorded their disagreement with theCommittee&apos;s recommendation. Since our policy in Palestine is closely related toour strategic position in this area and to our foreign policy in a very criticalfield, this seems to me a formidable consensus of opinion. It may, I trust, go someway to reinforce the views which I feel bound to express in opposition to thegreat majority of the Committee.4. Dislike of the policy of partition is based broadly on the following grounds:  (a) That partition would be regarded as a breach of our plighted faith byall the Arab peoples and also by the Jews. ?(b) That partition, even on the generous lines proposed by the CabinetCommittee, would not make an end of Jewish agitation but raiseit to greater fervour, particularly in America, where (so far as I can judge) it would be working, even in official quarters, on favourableground.(c) That the establishment of a sovereign and independent Jewish State inPalestine would be regarded as a deadly menace by all the Arab Statesand resisted accordingly a outrance by the whole Arab League.(d) That the grave anomalies and injustices inseparable from partition inany form would condemn us as the Mandatory Power in the proposedJerusalem State to even greater political, military and financialliabilities than those which have cost us so much embarrassment,humiliation and wasteful expenditure in the past twenty-five years.(e) That the conflict and loss of prestige which would result from partitionwould undermine our position in the Middle East. Since this oughtto be one of unchallenged predominance, partition would jeopardisea wide range of British interests in this region which are vital to imperial security and ought at all costs to be preserved.5. The Cabinet Committee will agree that the plan of partition was firstconceived at a time when Government and nation alike were suffering from adefeatist state of mind. It was born in weakness, and it is recommended, even now, not as a policy of strength, but as a pis-aller offering the only means ofescape from incompatible engagements which there is no hope of reconciling,as we have hitherto striven to do. I can see no reason why a victorious Empire,with a prestige far higher than it had before this war, should accept such a policy as inevitable, or declare to the world that it is unable to keep its word.II. The Objections to Partition.6. Before coming to proposals under which, as I believe, we shall have much better hope of a stable settlement, while also standing loyally by the declarationsto both races which we have made, I will try to state the objections to partitionin greater detail but in reasonable space. I cannot, of course, attempt to commentupon all the arguments adduced in a closely elaborated and exhaustive Report,since any such attempt would call for a document of equal length and for detailed consideration over a long period of time such as that for which the committee itself has sat. But I will endeavour to summarise the main arguments againstpartition which are advanced by those in immediate touch with facts and feelingsin this part of the world.7.   The Arabs would, it is held, resist partition because : (a) They would regard it as a breach of the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, in that it would *(i) make nearly one-third of the Arab population of Palestine subjects of a Jewish State against their will;(ii) deprive them of any voice in settling the future of jewish immigration.
(b) They believe, with good reason, that a Jewish State would be stronglynationalist, authoritarian and aggressive, and would not be contentfor long to remain within the frontiers laid down for it. They alsofear that the Jewish State would enjoy external support in itsexpansionist ambitions, which have been made amply clear in public utterances by prominent Zionists of all shades of opinion. They havelearnt, moreover, in the last five years how States with large financial resources and expansionist aims can now equip themselves forterrorism against poorer and more primitive peoples, and they fear that the English-speaking democracies might once again be ready to let events take their course in this region of the world, as they didin the case of France and of Turkey a generation ago, if interventionseemed to involve another threat of war.(c) They would therefore regard the establishment of a Jewish State as a threat to the security not only of the Arabs of Palestine, but to thatof all the surrounding countries which now form the Arab League.8.   The Jews would resist partition because (a) It would defeat the primary object of political Zionism, which is toobtain possession of the whole of Palestine.(&amp;) It would frustrate many of their plans and enormously narrow the scopeof the economic and. industrial development of Palestine which theyhave in mind.(c) It would cut them off from some of the places they most desire andvenerate, including Jerusalem Zion itself.(d) They believe they can count on mobilising a large measure of support inAmerica and elsewhere in their resistance to it.If these things are so, it is certain that partition would create, asDr. Weizmann himself has said, two irredenta a Jewish and an Arab; and thatthese would engender a constant danger of war.9. But our difficulties would not end there. I am deeply impressed by theconsensus of opinion among all British authorities in a good position to judgethat partition would lose us the goodwill and friendship of the whole of the moslem world. Our Imperial interests in this area are not limited to Palestine.The Middle East is, both politically and strategically, a regional whole; and thecreation of the Arab League illustrates the growing tendency of the Arab states to act and react together in matters which they consider vital to their common interests and security. The Moslems of India lie outside my sphere of responsi-bility; but Indian troops have fought most gallantly in the Middle East, and the close interest of Indian Moslems in this region is well known. It is thereforedifficult to believe that Moslem feeling in India on the subject of partition wouldnot be closely akin to Moslem opinion here.10. It may be useful to illustrate the importance of keeping the friendshipof the Arab world by reference to the duties which will fall upon the Royal AirForce in the period of transition which lies immediately, and even further, ahead.It seems generally agreed that those duties will be : (a) To ensure smooth and efficient running for the Trunk Air Routes from great Britain to India and the Far East and from Britain to SouthAfrica,(b) To train and keep ready for war that portion of the Royal Air force which His Majesty&apos;s Government may decide to station in the middle east for the defence of its vital interests in this region.(c) To assist in maintaining internal security in Palestine and in the othercountries comprised in the Middle East Command.(d) To prepare so far as may be for the strategic and tactical defence of theMiddle Eastern region against aggression from outside.It is clear that airfields will be necessary in Palestine and in other arab states both for the service of the Trunk Routes and for the operational andtraining units stationed in the area. These we now possess, within reinforcementrange of one another, but it will hardly be possible to retain them without thewilling co-operation of the Arab States. If we have that willing co-operation,each may well be persuaded, not only to give us the necessary facilities in its territory, but also to contribute in its own particular way to the defence scheme[29582] B 2
as a whole. It therefore seems indispensable to ensure that these countries, which,will never be able to afford adequate air or other defence for their several selves,will join us in a general defence scheme, each contributing what it can butdepending upon Britain and her Allies for the larger share. If we were to lose the co-operation of the Arab countries in these respects, it would be of littleconsolation that we remained able to maintain such bases and forces as we pleasedin the Jerusalem State, cut oii from the sea and surrounded on all sides bypotential enemies.11. The same considerations seem to me to apply broadly to the needs of theother two Services. The Navy is vitally interested in Alexandria, in the securityof our oil-wells and refineries and of the pipe-line to the Mediterranean, and alsoin the negotiations which will decide the future of the Suez Canal. The army would be of little value cooped up in a Suez Canal Zone and a Jerusalem Stateif our sea and air communications through the Middle Eastern region were notcompletely assured.12. From this broader standpoint, no less than from the narrower one ofPalestine alone, it seems to me probable that the proposed Jerusalem State wouldbe a source of weakness rather than of strength. If it were to be in truth a purelyreligious enclave, I would not take that view. But it is clearly intended to serve in addition as a military base, though the area allotted to it is hardly large enough for that purpose and it would suffer from precarious communications with the sea, since the military rights wdiich the Committee proposes that weshould demand over the ports and the pipe-line in the Jewish State would involvea good deal of interference with it, and might in course of time prove very hard to maintain. I am bound to add that the double character proposed for the jerusalem State seems to me unlikely to commend it to American opinion or the christian world at large. It would surely be undesirable to give any shadow ofexcuse for the charge that British material interests were being cloaked byreligious sentiment and thus pursued in a hypocritical guise.13. I am therefore forced to the conclusion that the trouble which partitionwould create for us in the international field would be greatly intensified by the extra military liabilities which it would entail. This is not the place in which to enlarge upon the best strategic arrangements for maintaining our position in theMiddle East. Some provisional studies of that subject are being prepared by theMiddle East Defence Committee, which will be forwarded at an early date.Enough to say here that all three Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, haveexpressed the opinion that, whatever the political settlement, our vital interestsrequire that we shall have the following rights in Palestine (C.C. (44) 19 of the2nd May. 1944)(a) The use of Haifa as a defended port secure against all forms of attack.(b) Control of all communications in Palestine.(c) Unrestricted facilities for the security, maintenance and training of suchArmy and Air Forces as we may wish to locate in Palestine for the broader needs of British strategy.The Cabinet Committee propose that the first of these requirements shouldbe met by a treaty engagement on the part of the Jewish State. This may very well prove precarious, since the defence of a port in modern conditions necessitatesinstallations and some considerable measure of control in a wide area surroundingit. The Committee, in any case, so far as I can see, makes no provision for thetwo broader requirements (b) and (c), unless it is to be understood that they willbe sufficiently covered by the establishment of a Jerusalem State under Britishgovernment. I hesitate to express any final opinion on that aspect of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations in the absence of comment on the subject from theChiefs of Staff; but I find it hard to conceive, under correction from our Serviceadvisers, how the proposed Jerusalem State could fail to become a militaryliability rather than a military asset in the conditions which partition would create throughout the Middle East.14. Finally, and quite apart from the other objections which I have endeavoured to state, I cannot escape the feeling that partition would be regardedas a policy of moral weakness throughout the Middle East; and moral weaknessis the one thing which we cannot afford to show in this region, if we are toundertake the main responsibility for its tranquillity and peace, as our vital interests necessitate. It is difficult to exaggerate how deeply the uncertainty ofour pre-war administration in Palestine told against us in the Middle Eastern
theatre when we were fighting for our lives. Reshid Ali in Iraq and the Muftiin Palestine did not at heart prefer Germany to Britain; they were anti-Britishin the main because they were anti-Zionist and they sought German assistance inorder to ensure against the Zionist menace, which overshadows the Arab peoples of every rank and type more darkly than anyone out of touch with Arab sentimentcan easily believe. Even King Ibn Saud was in sympathy with Reshid Ali upon that ground. Partition would convince the Arabs that we had weakly allowed the Zionist menace to become embodied in an organised and aggressive jewish state, and would therefore effect the confidence and respect which we have wonback by our staunchness since 1939. We could unquestionably impose it, if wechose to maintain the forces and incur the heavy expenditure which it would entail; but that method is not in British character, and, even if our people wereprepared to persist in it, it would never restore to us the reputation for sympathy and fair dealing with weaker peoples which is our greatest asset in this part ofthe world.15. The fact is that the course which we pursue in Palestine is inseparable from the broader question of playing the role which Imperial security demandsof us in the Middle Eastern region, where we must take the chief responsibilityfor peace if the communications and fuel supplies which are vital to the life ofthe Empire are to be kept open and secure. It is also an international questionof very wide scope, since the future of Jewry is an international question, and since hundreds of millions of Christians and Moslems alike are deeply concernedin the peace of the Holy Land. From both these broader standpoints, international and Middle Eastern, as well as from the purely racial one and from that of doingour utmost to keep our word, partition seems to me unlikely to afford any stableor even practicable solution of the troubles which have afflicted and humiliatedus for twenty-five years.16. Two other aspects of the Committee&apos;s plan give me serious pause,namely, its effect upon the material development of Palestine and the fact thatit would virtually commit us to advocacy of a Greater Syria for the sake of arab Galilee, if for no other cause. As to development, Amerircan opinionappears bound to insist that the greatest possible number of Jews shall finda home in Palestine. That is in the spirit of our pledge also, which we are bound to honour to the full. But if it is to be honoured, Palestine (which is small enough already, owing to the settlement made after the last war) mustassuredly be developed as a whole. There is no possible way of making themost of the bountiful water-supplies which can be tapped in the Levant ifinter-State boundaries even within the small area of Palestine itself divide the sources of water from a large part of the land. Consequently, the reportsof the American experts who have been studying the possibilities of irrigationare certain to assume that the country is not broken up into independent States.Those experts seem confident of being able to fertilise a very considerable area at present unused or only partly used. My own impression, for what it is worth,is that a living may be found on the land for at least another million souls inthe next twenty or twenty-five years. The natural increase of the Arab popula-tion will take a good part of this; the Jews, whose industry and resource are most impressive, will certainly make the most of their share; and the growth of industry should add in some considerable measure to the total population which Palestine can maintain, provided power can be developed cheaply, thehome market protected and outside markets obtained. But this development willnot be possible unless Jews and Arabs begin to co-operate and unless palestine is regarded as indivisible. The additional number of Jews which Palestinecan accommodate is unlikely to exceed the natural increase of the arab population. Both should grow if Palestine is properly developed, and the oppor-tunities are fairly distributed between the two.17. However that may be, I cannot but feel that the Jews have anunanswerable case for claiming that the land and its many untapped resourcesshall be used to the full. They can make that case good in the internationalfield, particularly in America, and they will in consequence produce an oppositionto partition which we can only resist by declaring that the task of holding thebalance firmly between Jew and Arab is beyond our power. Why should theBritish Empire abase itself in that way ? There is no reason why a total ofa million and perhaps more Jews should not live happily in Palestine with Arabacquiescence and in harmony with their neighbours a generation hence, providedthat Britain keeps faith and holds the scales fairly between Jew and Arab till
a bi-racial self-governing State can be safely recognised by other Powers. ButI do not believe that this can be done in a divided land against deep-seated Arabopposition and amidst constant danger of war.18. In this connection, and for other reasons as well, I see grave objectionto the Cabinet Committee&apos;s plan of linking the proposed Arab State in Palestinewith Trans-Jordan, the ultimate object being the creation of a Greater Syriawhich would have direct connection with the isolated Arab area of Galilee.Events have moved fast in the Arab world since my predecessor, after consulta-tion with a Middle Eastern Conference held in Cairo last year, recommendedthat the project of a Greater Syria should nor form part of our immediate policy but should continue to have our cordial support. Like most other people withsome experience in this region, I greatly regret the Baikanisation of the Levantwhich took place after the last war. The new Arab League has made someeffort to remedy its worst effects; but the harm has been done, republican systemshave been formed which are suspicious of the ambitions of the dynasties, thosedynasties are themselves divided by conflicting; aims, and the combination ofthese factors has recently produced a good deal of dissension, which has resultedin some emasculation of the original draft of the Arab Pact. As Lord Killearnhas dealt very clearly with this intricate subject in a recent telegram (SavingNo. 80 of 23rd March), I will content myself with referring my colleagues tothe opinions there expressed, with which I am in full agreement, though it maybe as well to underline Lord Killearn&apos;s final observation that &quot; the only aimson which all these States are united are those of getting rid of the french from Syria and of preventing the Zionist domination of Palestine.&quot;19. I feel that it would be unwise for us, as things are, to associate ourselves with any project for altering the present boundaries of the Arab States, myimpression being that we shall find it much easier to keep the confidence andco-operation of all. which we undoubtedly need, by maintaining an Olympiandetachment from their mutual suspicions, rival ambitions, and the deep network of intrigue which results from them. I must also observe that, since a considerable part of the water needed for the development of Palestine can be best tappedand conserved in the highlands of Syria and the Lebanon, the close co-operation and friendship of those States is indispensable to the Jewish plans for developingirrigation and water-power on a lars;e scale. An independent Jewish Statecould not hope for such co-operation, and would almost certainly be alsoconfronted with a general Arab boycott of its trade. I must add that it wouldbe an evil day which divided the whole valley of the Jordan from the rest of the holy Land. What I would hope to see is a Joint Water Commission containingrepresentatives of the Levant States and of an undivided Palestine.20. To summarise, I agree with the Cabinet Committee that it is impossibleto ensure good government and a fair balance between the races in the conditionscreated by the Mandate, the 1939 White Paper and the present structure ofgovernment in Palestine; but I am equally convinced that the policy of partitionwould only increase our difficulties, reduce our capacity for dealing with them,and embitter Jew and Arab to a pitch which would make armed conflict betweenthem at some time inevitable. That we should admit ourselves forced to such aconfession of failure would. I am confident, shatter British prestige in the middle east, high as it is after the splendid record of our peoples and fighting services in the war, convince the Arab world that we were relapsing into our pre-warmood of weakness and indifference, and thus make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to preserve the vital interests of the Empire in this central and most critical area.III. The Defects of the Mandate and the Remedy.21. The strong reasons which prompted the Committee to recommendpartition were summarised in paragraph 2 of this despatch. They are, it will beremembered : &apos;(a) The incorrigible defects of the existing system of government, and(b) The impossibility of establishing any rule to govern Jewish immigrationwhich both Arabs and Jews will accept.These reasons are stated with great force in paragraphs 4 and 5 of theCommittee&apos;s Report. I propose to analyse them in the hope of showing that thevery serious difficulties they have presented in the past may now be overcome,
if we are able to negotiate a trust on new terms which will correct the defects ofour present Mandate. I understand that all Mandates are to be reconsideredin the new peace settlement with the object of establishing a better method ofinternational co-operation and control; and I believe that we should welcomeinternational co-operation in building up a peaceful future for the Holy Land,provided it is kept undivided and provided also that our responsibility for administering and defending it is in no way impaired. As the Holy Land of thethree great monotheistic Faiths, it is peculiarly suited to become an internationaltrust; and the terms of the trust can, I believe, be so devised as to correct thefundamental defects of the present Mandate and of the unsatisfactory system ofgovernment which has resulted from it.22. The Cabinet Committee deals in paragraphs 71 to 78 of its Report withthe functions that might be assigned to an International Body and recommends that such a Body should be set up in Jerusalem to supervise the discharge by all three new States of their treaty obligations. I find myself in cordial agreementwith this part of their proposals, though I would suggest a different role for theInternational Body than that which is outlined by the Committee in paragraph 74.Its first duty, I suggest, should be to frame a new Mandate or Trust for anundivided Palestine, Britain retaining her present responsibility for the adminis-tration and security of Palestine as a whole but on new terms which she herselfshould, in the first place, propose. I believe that a new trust of this charactercan be so framed as to correct the defects in the present Mandate, which are themain cause of our failure to develop Palestine as a Jewish National Home not inconsistent with the welfare, peace and progress of its Arab inhabitants. Wehave often declared that our purpose was to create such a home in Palestine, butnot to allow the whole of Palestine with all its Arab population to pass under a purely Jewish domination. The Command Paper of 1922 (cmd.. 1700), forinstance, laid it clown that His Majesty&apos;s Government had &quot; at no timecontemplated the disappearance or the subordination of Arabic population,language or culture in Palestine&quot;; and the 1939 White Paper (paragraph 4),after declaring unequivocally that it was no part of the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that &quot;Palestine should become a Jewish State,&quot; went on to statethat His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot; would indeed regard it as contrary to theobligations to the Arabs under the Mandate, as well as to assurances which havebeen given to the Arab people in the past, that the Arab population of palestine should be made subjects of a Jewish State against their will.&quot; The only way ofhonouring our many declarations to the full is to persist in the endeavour to buildup a peaceful bi-racial State; and I do not believe that we are entitled toabandon that endeavour as hopelessly impracticable, despite our stultifyingexperiences in the last twenty-five years, provided the defects in the presentMandate be radically corrected and the proposed International Body chargedwith that part of our existing responsibilities which political conditions inPalestine and in other parts of the world have placed it beyond our strength todischarge peacefully and effectively alone.23. The fundamental defects of the present system are due, I submit, to three main causes, all of which can be removed. They arise partly out of the formof the Mandate itself and partly out of our own failure to govern with sufficientfirmness and clarit)^ of aim.  I will take the three causes in turn.24. First and foremost is the fact that under the Mandate Britain bearsthe sole responsibility of deciding how much Jewish immigration is to be admitted into Palestine. Powerful as we are, we are not in a position to bear that responsi-bility alone because it can be used at every turn for agitation in the United Statesand for defamation of British policy as the sole reason why hundreds of thousands of suffering Jews have not found safe refuge in the Holy Land. It embroils usequally with the Arabs, and it drove us to the surrender involved in the 1939White Paper, which is regarded as final by the Arabs, though it was condemnedby a majority of one in the Mandates Commission and never submitted forendorsement to the Council of the League. If the terms of the Mandate arerevised so as to preclude perpetual agitation and unsettlement on the question of jewish immigration, as I believe they can be, one of the vices inherent in thepresent system will have been finally cured.25. The best means of achieving this is not, I submit, to carve Palestineup and thereby to abandon our undertaking to give the Jews the fullest possible opportunity of settling in it compatible with the rights of its Arab inhabitants,but rather to place the final responsibility for deciding howr much Jewishcolonisation Palestine can still absorb upon a suitable international authority
which cannot be successfully challenged by either Arabs or Jews; and since theBritish Government is pledged by the White Paper to secure Arab acquiescence in any Jewish immigration beyond the quota established in 1939, we should insist that the Arab League should be fairly represented upon that authority. If theArabs are persuaded to accept that solution-as with the support of the manorPowers and the concurrence of the United Nations I believe they can-our pledge to them would have been discharged without prejudice to the legitimate Jewishdream of fertilising every unused or half-used acre in Palestine which can bewon for intensive cultivation, the principle being accepted by the new inter-national authority that space must be won for the natural increase of the arab population as well as for the, settlement of homeless Jews.26. Under such an authority there would be no room for the idea that aconsiderable part of Palestine can be kept only half developed for cultivationin the primitive traditional way. The Arabs themselves have, in fact, already made great progress in that way, and are unquestionably anxious to improve theirmethods and make more of their land. The Jews, on their side, would have torecognise that, though the new authority would be pledged to fertilise and develop the country to the full, so that many more Jews may settle in Palestine, theycannot ever hope to constitute a majority of its population or to establish a purelyJewish Government over the Holy Land. No one can tell what in futureconditions will be the pressure of Jewish immigrants to enter Palestine; but itis not unreasonable to believe that a balance may be struck between Jewishpressure and Arab resistance which, under strong international supervision andfirm administration on the spot, may gradually bring the hostile camps of Jewand Arab&apos; into harmony, provided the new world authority can persuade theJewish leaders to abandon their aggressively nationalist aims and thus relieve the Arabs of their present deep-seated fears.27. But that correction of the present Mandate would not be sufficientalone. In order that firm government leading up to self-government may beestablished in Palestine and the armed hostility of Jew and Arab for everexorcised, it is essential that a second major fault in the Mandate should be corrected. That fault is the recognition of a Jewish Agency on terms which,combined with the weakness of the Mandatory Power, have enabled the Jews toset up a shadow Government with armed forces of its own and a highly developedsystem of authoritarian control over Jewish education, industry and settlement.It is this which has convinced the Arabs that a Jewish State, with the greatcommand of money and scientific knowledge which it would have, would be organised for aggression on a formidable scale; and no one can pretend thatthe policy and propaganda of the Jewish Agency give no colour to Arab views.It is this factor also which has largely undermined our own administration and prevented progress towards effective self-government, such as has been realised in all other Middle Eastern States.28. The Jewish Agency is hardly to be blamed for the deleterious effect ofits activities and ambitions upon our fulfilment of the double responsibility whichthe Balfour Declaration and the Mandate laid upon us. It was supported bythe enthusiasm and wealth of ardent Zionists throughout the world. It had more to spend on development and social services than the Government of theMandatory Power; and when the Arabs turned against the Jewish colonies itfound that Government unable to maintain the security of its subjects or to upholdthe law. It has in consequence grown steadily in power until, with ourconnivance, it now in many ways takes the place of the Mandatory Governmentand overshadows a considerable part of Palestine. In the process, moreover, of intensive organisation and development it has had recourse to highly authori-tarian methods and has given birth to a militant racial cult entirely inconsistent with the ideals for which the democracies have been fighting.in this war. this could have been prevented by firmness from the outset and, as I have said, bygreater clarity of aim; it was not prevented because the Government of palestine was for many years inadequately supported from home. The effect upon Britonsserving in Palestine and also on the Arab population was deplorable. The formerhad to struggle on with resources inferior to those deployed by the jewish agency. (The Jewish Agency, for instance, is housed in ah imposing fortressin one of the new quarters of Jerusalem; the British Secretariat shares with theBritish Military Headquarters the two upper storeys of a nearby hotel.) BothCivil Service and Police were exposed to the constant clanger of violence; manylost life and limb with little redress or sign of sympathy from their Government
and fellow-countrymen at home. The growth of Jewish strength in theseconditions over a period of sixteen or seventeen years ultimately caused anattempt on the part of the Arabs to take the law into their own hands. The finalconsequence was the surrender of 1939 to Arab demands and a general convictionthroughout the Middle East amongst both Arabs and Jews that the BritishGovernment would concede to violence whatever its perpetrators claimed.29. The weakness of our own administration, combined with the continuousexpansion of the Jewish Agency&apos;s control over all Palestinian Jews, had otherconsequences of the gravest kind. Because it could deal effectively with neitherArab nor Jew, the Mandatory Government has become a close corporation of theCrown Colony type which has given no opportunity of public service in thehighest posts to the inhabitants of the land. That Jewish capacity was availablein rich measure the activities of the Jewish Agency have shown; and it is a libelon Arab capacity to maintain that what other Middle Eastern States have produced is non-existent in Palestine. The example of Iraq is particularlyapposite so far as Arab capacity is concerned. When Sir Kinahan Cornwalliswent there in 1941 the Government had turned against us and the Army washostile through and through. There must have been a strong temptation to putBritish soldiers or civil servants in all the seats of power. But Sir Kinahanpreferred to let the Iraqis rebuild their own State, and they have proved not onlycapable of doing so but have welcomed the help of unobtrusive British advisers and have become more friendly to Britain than any other Arab country, takingpeople, politicians and army as a whole. The same result has been achieved inTransjordan. It is owing solely to lack of sinew, in the financial as well as thepolitical sense, and uncertainty of aim that it has not been achieved in Palestine.We have yielded alternately to Jew and Arab, but we have not given either anadequate opportunity of sharing in the higher administration of theirancient land.30. I believe that under a new trust which corrects the defects I have described and with strong international support we can still achieve in Palestinewhat (with the one exception of Ireland) we have never failed to achieve eise-where; but the exclusive and authoritarian features in Jewish nationalism would,I fear, become intensified in the narrow confines of the proposed Jewish State,and there can never be real co-operation between Jews and Arabs until theyare both subject to a truly single system of government in which both participateon equal terms. Neither partition, therefore, nor a continuance of the presentsystem of government can give Palestine what we were pledged to give it and what the welfare of its two racial communities and of the Middle East in generalrequires. But there seems to me no reason why, under a new trust backed bystrong international support, its present system of government should not beradically reformed. I hope, therefore, that my colleagues wall be prepared toconsider the outline of such a trust which follows.IV. The Outlines of a New Trust for Palestine.31. The main purpose of the new trust should be to give Palestine a singlesystem of government, to promote its development for Jews and Arabs alike, andto make the two peoples responsible in. clue course for their own government.The two balancing essentials in the new trust would be fidelity to the spirit ofthe Balfour declaration and to the spirit of our pledge in 1939 to secure Arabacquiescence in any proposals for further Jewish immigration. It is evidentthat the spirit of the constitutional proposals set out in the 1939 White paper should also be preserved. I submit, with confidence, that, with international co--operation and support, these objects can all be attained.32. It must be clear, in the first place, that Britain retains full responsibilityfor the government of the Holy Land, and that its administration is entrusted to a British High Commissioner with all the necessary powers. There shouldbe no alteration of the existing Mandate in that respect.33. The first alteration in the Mandate required is that the responsibilityof deciding upon the rate and extent of Jewish immigration should no longerrest upon Britain alone but upon the International Body which the CabinetCommittee has proposed. That Body, I suggest, should consist of one repre-sentative each for Britain, the United States, Russia and * France, two representatives of the Arab States (to be chosen by the Arab League) and two[29582] c
representatives of Jewry (to be chosen by the American Government with theadvice of such Jewish organisations as wished to submit candidates). The Britishmember should always be chairman of this Council as representing the administering Power.&quot; The International Body should be the final authorityupon the rate and extent of Jewish immigration into Palestine, with this proviso,that if the British chairman had reason to believe that its decision would causedisturbance in Palestine, he should be empowered to refer the decision to the world security Council for endorsement or revision as that Council might decide. Inaccordance with the spirit of the 1939 White Paper, the Arab members shouldhave the right of appealing to the World Security Council if the Palestine Councilarrived at any decision in which they were unable to concur. The Jewish members should have an equal right.34. It is for consideration whether the British High Commissioner shouldbe responsible to the Palestine Council in any way beyond observance of its decisions upon immigration. My recommendation is that the High commissioner should be responsible to the Council only for governing in accordance with theconstitution, to the principles of which I now come. In my opinion, the main linesof the constitution should be laid down in the trust, and revision of theconstitution should not be possible without the approval of the international body, which should also have the duty of ensuring that the constitution is observed and that impartial use is made of the Palestine Development Fund(see paragraph 43). In all matters of administration, however, the HighCommissioner should be responsible to the British Government alone. It wouldnot be desirable that the Council, like the late Mandates Commission, shouldhave the power of enquiring into and commenting on matters of administration which, like the Mandates Commission, it would imperfectly understand.35. In conformity with the above proposals, the constitution of palestine should be laid down in the new trust. It is essential, first and foremost, thatthe people of Palestine, like that&apos; of every civilised country, should be subjectto a single system of Government, and that all the armed forces in the country should be under the immediate control of that Government. It should givePalestinians, whatever their race, like Irakians or Trans Jordanians, the oppor-tunity of participating in the Government of their country and directing itsvarious departments. This is not the place in which to discuss the detailsof the constitution which would suit Palestine best; but I should myselfrecommend something closely resembling the constitution of Transjordan whichhas worked extremely well, the British High Commissioner in Palestinepossessing the powers and performing the functions possessed and performedin Transjordan by the combination of British Resident and Amir. It is truethat Palestine would require a highly articulated form of local Governmentwhich Transjordan does not require, because the Arab and Jewish communities in Palestine, though closely mixed geographically, are nevertheless distrustfulof each other, subject in some ways to different codes of law, and in other respectsdistinct. But this need could be met by the establishment of communal localauthorities such as were recommended by Sir Harold MacMichael in 1938 (seethe Appendix to this despatch). Provision should also be made for setting apartthe city and neighbourhood of Jerusalem as a true religious enclave under aspecial trust, as the Cabinet Committee recommends.36. We have a wealth of experience to draw upon in diplomats andadministrators like Sir Kinahan Cornwallis and Sir Harold MacMichaei for working out the details of a constitutional and administrative-system whichwould bring the peoples of the Holy Land together in its central&apos;Governmentwhile giving a wise latitude to local and communal sentiment. If there areJews as well as Arabs in Palestine, there are Kurds as well as Arabs in Iraq;and in both countries those very different communities must learn to livetogether in peace. There could not have been a more delicate moment forleaving power in the hands of national Ministers than 1941 in Iraq; but underwise guidance the experiment has justified itself by a really striking success.Not that all the problems of Iraq or Transjordan or any other Arab (or European)country have been, or ever can be, solved in a few years by any system of Govern-ment. The point is that the peoples of Iraq and Transjordan have takenresponsibility under rulers with considerable personal powers and that thesystem is working in both countries with reasonable efficiency.37. Like the Amir in Transjordan, the High Commissioner would pick his ministers from the Palestinian people, but he should also have the right of
appointing British advisers throughout every department, with such powers in each case as he considered necessary to ensure that he was kept fully informed and that the policy of the Government was being loyally carried out. TheMinisters would not be responsible to the legislature in the British sense but would serve at the High Commissioner&apos;s pleasure. They should, however, beable to attend the legislature and liable to question in it on the conduct of their departments. This system would follow American rather than British con-stitutional ideas, but we have applied it in Transjordan with success.38. In his outline of a scheme of local autonomy for Palestine already referred to (see paragraph 35), Sir Harold MacMichael recommended that an arab and a Jewish Central Council should be set up in each of five districtswhich he defined, and that a Legislative Council should be formed from theArab and Jewish Central Councils which he proposed as soon as both raceswere agreed upon its constitution. I would suggest that these District CentralCouncils should be formed as soon as possible and that the Legislative council should then be formed out of them, each District Central Council, Arab and jewish, electing the same number of representatives to the Legislative Council,so that the two races should be equally represented in the latter. The LegislativeCouncil should have power to discuss the Budget but not to delay its passageafter a given period for debate. It should also have power to pass Bills. Itis desirable that neither race should have a majority in the Council, in orderthat no majority should be obtainable without an admixture of both.39. The constitution should provide that neither race is entitled to maintainarmed forces or to possess unlicensed arms. Peace and order should be guaranteed by an adequate Police Force, and in the last resort by the armed forces of theCrown. If the Police Force could be recruited equally from British subjects and american citizens, its difficulties would command a wider sympathy than hasbeen given to the Police Forces of Palestine in the past. Many admirable recruitswill be available from both countries when their forces begin to be demobilised,and the pay should, of course, be equal for men of both nationalities. There would still be need, at any rate for a time, of a local and communal police such as theJews now maintain in their settlements; but these forces should be a charge on Urban and Rural Council funds, and should come under Government inspection and command.40. It will be evident that these proposals provide for the economic andpolitical development of Palestine in such a way that the government of thecountry will pass into the hands of those Palestinians who show themselves bestfitted to discharge it so soon as the bitter hatreds between Jew and Arab havegiven place to a realisation that neither, as a race, can aspire to exclusive control.That is the only way, I believe, in which the rich talent of the Jews can ever comeinto its own as the inspiration and mainspring of a new era of peace and prosperity in the Holy Land. It is also the only way in which the return of theJews to Zion can ever become acceptable to the Arab peoples, who will otherwiseresist it until the Remnant is reduced to hopelessness and ultimately destroyed.Yet these proposals, hard enough for the Arabs to accept as they undoubtedly are,will be ardently denounced by the more extreme forces of Zionism, which will maintain that Palestine should be thrown open to unlimited Jewish immigrationin order that the suffering Jews of all countries may find at last a national home of their own in the historic cradle of their race. This is, of course, animpracticable claim, for it would make a shambles of the Holy Land. It alsogoes far beyond the spirit of the Balfour Declaration, to which we are in honourpledged. We are therefore entitled to see that the humanitarian feelings of thewestern world cannot fairly be mobilised in order to advance the Zionist aim of creating a Jewish majority in Palestine (a great proportion of the Arabs beingdriven perforce elsewhere), and of bringing the whole country from the Lebanonand Syria to Egypt under Jewish control.41. It is, of course, impossible at present to measure what the pressure ofhomeless Jews to settle in Palestine may prove to be in the next few years; but itis an unquestionable fact that western sympathy with Jewish suffering, combined with anti-Semitism in disguise, has gravely complicated the Palestine problem and given rise to totally unrealistic conceptions of what Britain, as theMandatory Power in Palestine, can in sober truth do. It. is therefore much tobe hoped that, concurrently with the discussion of these proposals, if the Cabinetapproves them, there may also be under study plans for dealing with the refugee[29582] c2
problem in Europe and some signs of readiness on the part of the ChristianPowers to show that they are not asking the Arabs to accept an unlimited flow of European refugees whom they would not themselves be prepared to acceptwithout careful and individual examination, if indeed they accepted them at all.This subject lies outside my sphere of responsibility, but it affects it so seriouslythat I hope I may be excused for mentioning it.42. What the Jewish Agency and Zionists in general can truly urge is that palestine appeals to Jewish sentiment as no other land and that funds will always be available for the enrichment of Palestine which will never be subscribed forthe settlement of Jews elsewhere. That has been Dr. Weizmann&apos;s major themesince he threw his outstanding personality, scientific genius and general powerof mind into the Zionist cause, and he has unquestionably proved, by splendidachievement in Palestine, what the wealth, enthusiasm and scientific resourceavailable to Zionism can do. The tragedy of Zionism has been its canalisationin a narrow nationalist cult which has become authoritarian, totalitarian andchauvinistic to a very dangerous degree. This development is totally inconsistent with the ideals of those who originally espoused and pledged themselves to the zionist cause. There are forces in the Zionist movement which the Arabs have every reason to fear forces which we ourselves have been striving to neutraliseby awful suffering and sacrifice in this war. Lord Moyne and many others havefallen victim to those forces; Sir Harold MacMichael and many others have beenwithin an ace of doing so; and the tale may not yet be complete. But the assassinsare the corruption, as the extremer nationalists are the contraction, of a broad andnoble cause; and it would be lamentable if all the zeal and talent which havetransfigured many parts of Palestine in the past twenty-five years were now tobe lost to the enrichment and betterment of that land as an indivisible whole.Our aim should not be to disparage or discourage Zionism, still less to deny itthe legitimate opportunity for which it craves, but to convert it to the broaderpurpose. Of re-entering Zion by moderation, statesmanship and genuine under-standing for the Arab standpoint, rather than of striving to take Zion by violenceafter defacing it with bloodshed and crime.43. Strong American understanding and support will be necessary to usin guiding Zionism back to this, its original peaceful aim. It must also be realised that the irrigation and further development of Palestine cannot be entrustedsolely to Jewish capital and control without creating yet another para-governmental power entirely out of keeping with the rights and duties of acivilised State. This was clearly appreciated by the American engineers to whom spoke in Palestine. I consider, therefore, that some means must be found of financing the development of Palestine for the equal benefit of both races andunder official control without discouraging the flow of Jewish capital for Jewishenterprise. With this object I would submit for consideration the establishmentof a Palestine Development Fund, the resources of which would be applied to development in Palestine by a specially constituted Ministry containing advisersexperienced in American development by irrigation, power-production and other means.   The members should be representative of both races in Palestine.44. As proof of their earnest desire that Palestine should be developed tothe full, the British and American Governments would be well advised to launchthe fund with a generous initial subscription say of  20 million each. Thiswould cost us less than partition would be certain to cost in the end. The CabinetCommittee recommends an initial grant of  5 million to the Jerusalem State(half on loan) and an annual recurrent grant of  200,000 &quot; for some years.&quot; Thiswould amount to  9 million over twenty years, and it would at least be doubtfulwhether that part of it which was on loan ( 2^ million) would ever be repaid. it also recommends an annual grant of  250,000 to the Arab State for eight years,or a total of  2 million more. It is difficult to believe that these sums would prove adequate to secure a development and betterment of the Jerusalem and arab states comparable to. that which would be apparent in the Jewish State; but whether that were so or not, it makes no allowance for the military and policeexpenditure which would be forced on us by frontier trouble and worse. I would add that a considerable initial grant by the two Governments, British and american, to the Palestine Development Fund would be the best means ofestablishing complete Government control over the principal non-local water supplies. This has been found indispensable in the United States, and it willnot be less essential in Palestine if water supplies and rates are to be providentlyand impartially administered.   The control of water in dry countries gives its
owners such power that it should not be entrusted to private interests. Jewishcapital would, of course, still be free to further Jewish enterprise; but the controlof water collected from the main water-sheds should be in the Government&apos;shands, and the resources of the Palestine Development Fund should be usedimpartially for the benefit of both Arabs and Jews.45. It will be clear that these recommendations, if adopted, will bring our administration in Palestine into closer relation than ever with Anglo-american and international affairs. I asume that in such conditions the responsibility forPalestine will pass from the Colonial Office to the Foreign Office, as in the case ofthe Sudan. That change will, I think, be essential if the High Commissioner ofPalestine is not to be responsible to two Departments of State with all theconfusion that inevitably ensues.46. I have not attempted in this despatch to enter into detailed commentupon the Cabinet Committee&apos;s carefully studied and exhaustive Report, since anysuch attempt would require a document of equal length and as much time for detailed consideration as the Committee itself has employed. My assumption hasbeen that the decision of the Cabinet as a whole would turn mainly upon thearguments advanced in the preliminary section headed &quot; Long-Term Policy &quot;(paragraphs 4-6). These constitute the main basis of the Committee&apos;s recom-mendations, and I find myself unable to accept them, even so far as Palestine itself is concerned. Taking also into account, as I am bound to do, the effect of such adecision upon the prestige and vital interests of the Empire in the Middle East,I have felt compelled to comment upon them with a frankness which will, I hope,be forgiven by my colleagues, because my conviction is deep and sincere, and isunanimously supported by all His Majesty&apos;s Chief representatives in the middle east.47. I am also very conscious that in setting out what I believe to be a betteralternative this despatch cannot stand comparison with the cogent and clearlyargued exposition of its recommendations which characterises the Committee&apos;sReport. I have not had the time to attempt an exposition of that detailed kind,nor is my office in Cairo adequately equipped for it. I believe, however, that themain principles of the alternative which I have imperfectly represented may beso elaborated and applied as to make a new start possible on lines which correct the fundamental defects of the present system of government in Palestine; and Iurge consideration of that alternative because it will not (as I fear partition may)expose us.to the charge of breaking faith with either Arabs or Jews; because itwill make impossible (as partition assuredly would not) the creation of anauthoritarian Jewish State of a type not reconcilable with the principles for whichwe have fought in this war and certain to arouse the implacable enmity of thewhole Arab League; because it will provide for the development of Palestine on a scale which it cannot attain if parcelled between three independent States; and,finally, because I regard it as the only practicable way of preserving the prestige and vital interests of the British Empire in the Middle East.48. I may very reasonably be asked, on this last point, how the policy i recommend will serve our Imperial interests when Palestine becomes in due coursean independent State. It is difficult to look into so distant a future with muchconfidence in one&apos;s own percipience. The two races in Palestine will assuredlynot learn co-operation and mutual trust without passing through a long period of apprentiship under firm British administration with adequate internationalsupport. The moment of complete emancipation will, however, in my belief arrive;and I would not fear it if we still held the confidence of the Middle Easternpeoples, as I think we should. The strategic requirements of the Empire in this region are so wide that they can be met only by the co-operation of all the middle eastern States, whereas to be sovereign in a small land-bound island such as the jerusalem State could not compensate us for the loss of essential facilities else-where. It is therefore of the Middle East as a single region that it is necessaryto think.49. If we are to consult the pride of the Arab peoples, which is verysensitive, while ensuring readiness on their part to afford us the bases, communi-nations and goodwill which are indispensable to us, we should, I-believe, reducethe forces permanently stationed in their countries to the lowest limit whichsecurity will permit. Treaty rights are in any case notoriously precarious, andwe should endeavour to obtain some surer foundations than they can ever afford.
My belief is that security will best be maintained by the lease of such bases as are indispensable, by securing the participation of local land and air forcesin a scheme of comprehensive defence, and by arranging for annual combinedexercises which will show our Services in active operations over all the areas essen-tial to our communications, oil supplies and other vital interests. Air and air-borne forces are especially suitable for training demonstrations of that sort, andthey seem to me likely to make possible a better and more, friendly appreciation of our strength than permanent garrisons, which will assuredly be disliked.50. Having ourselves leased bases in British territory to the AmericanGovernment, we should be able to negotiate leases in the Middle East withoutinjury to the pride of the Middle Eastern peoples. In Palestine, as elsewhere,we should, I submit, arrange betimes for the lease of such bases as we shall need;and if, with this essential proviso, we bring an undivided bi-racial and unaggres-sive Palestine into the Middle East comity of nations, we shall in my beliefretain a stronger hold upon the whole region than will ever be possible if we find our military facilities reduced to those available in an isolated sanctuarywith a Jewish State between it and the sea. Such a tenure, which would pre-sumably in any case be terminated some day, would be small compensation&quot; forthe loss of the friendships which we now possess amongst the States of the arab league and for the ill-will which we should have sown amongst Moslems every-where without having held, or even at the last deserved, the goodwill of those whose hearts are given to the Zionist cause.
APPENDIX.Outline of a Scheme of Local Autonomy for Palestine.(Forwarded by the High Commissioner, Palestine, to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies under cover of a D/O letter dated 25th October, 1938.)Object of the proposals.1. The Royal Commission^ proposal for a territorial partition of thecountry has failed, mainly owing to the fact that there is no rural area inPalestine of any considerable extent in which the Jews form the majority ofthe population. The same consideration militates against the adoption of any scheme based on cantonisation, as the word is usually understood.The present proposals contemplate a system which, while conferring on eachrace the power to manage its own affairs-to a very large degree, is non-territorial and consequently not open to the objection mentioned above.Outline of the scheme.2.   38 local Councils to be established as follows :  4 City Councils (Jerusalem, Haifa. Tel-Aviv and Jaffa).24 Urban Councils.10 Rural Councils.3.   The 28 City and Urban Councils are already in being.Of these, two City Councils (those of Jerusalem and Haifa) and two UrbanCouncils (those of safe and Tiberias) are and would continue to be &quot; mixed,&quot;containing both Arab and Jewish representatives. The other twenty-four arepurely communal, being either wholly Arab or wholly Jewish. Under the scheme,considerably greater powers would be delegated to these Councils than areexercised by them at present.4. For the purpose of the Rural Councils, Palestine would be divided intofive Divisions, as shown on the accompanying map. The boundaries follow thoseof existing Districts. In each Division two Rural Councils would be established,one, an Arab Council, dealing with the interests of the Arab villages, the other,a Jewish Council dealing with the interests of the Jewish settlements.5. The Beersheba Sub-district, which is inhabited mainly by nomad Beduin,presents a different, but in no way difficult, problem. It would be given a systemof &quot; Native Administration &quot; under the supervision of the mandatory power.6. The scheme is illustrated diagrammatically in Statement I, which alsoshows how, provided co-operation between the two races can be obtained, progress can be made by stages towards the ultimate ideal of a responsible government.The intermediate stage of control through a Legislative Council would bereached when both parties were agreed upon its constitution. It is assumed thatthis might be in anything from two to ten years.7. The population falling within the purview of the various local Councilsis shown in Statements II and II (a), from which it will be seen that the minorityproblem would, under the scheme, practically disappear.Delegation of Powers.8. Extensive powers would be delegated to the various local bodies. Thepowers which might be so delegated in the initial stages of the scheme are shownin Statement III. The list there given is in outline only and would requireconsiderable amplification in detail.The process of decentralisation would be progressive and more and morepower would be transferred as the prestige and sense of responsibility of the council&apos;s increased.Functions of the Central Government.9. The Central Government would, have general powers of superintendence,direction and control over the activities of the. local bodies. Departments of theCentral Government would continue to act in an executive capacity in respect of reserved subjects; in respect of transferred subjects they would be converted into
inspectorates. The degree of control and inspection would depend largely uponwhether the particular activity was financed from the local body&apos;s own resourcesor whether it was dependent on a grant-in-aid from the Central Government.Finance.10. As regards finance, the general aim would be to allot to local councils the direct revenue arising within their jurisdictions, e.g., Urban and RuralProperty Tax. Indirect revenue, e.g., Customs Receipts, would accrue to theCentral Government and be utilised, first, to defray expenditure on reservedsubjects and the cost of central administration; and, secondly, for the purposeof grants-in-aid to the Councils for activities which they were unable to financefrom their own resources.Summary.11.   The advantages of the scheme would be : (a) With insignificant exceptions, the administration of Arab interests willbe in the hands of Arabs, that of Jewish interests in the hands of Jews.(b) In the initial stages of the scheme the Central Government will possessfull powers of direction, superintendence and control, which powers will be relaxed as the prestige and sense of responsibility of the council&apos;s increase.(c) The scheme provides for an advance by stages towards the ideal of fullresponsible government.12. The scheme has, of course, no bearing on the questions of immigrationor land sales, which must be decided as matters of policy independent of it. Thereis nothing in the scheme militating against this course.
