THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET./Copy No.W.P. (45) 239.10th April, 1945.//WAR CABINET.SUPPLY OF EQUIPMENT TO SPAIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.SEVERAL enquiries have recently been received regarding the purchase inthis country of various items of war material and of equipment of a semi-military character for the Spanish Government. A list of these items is annexed to this paper.2. No war material has been supplied to Spain since the outbreak of theCivil War, though no actual decision to this effect has been taken in the mattersince the Civil War came to an end. I do not, however, wish to advocate thesupply of actual weapons of war to Spain at this time since there are obviouspolitical objections to such a course.3. I am, however, anxious, in the interests of our export trade, and of thedevelopment of our post-war trade connexions, that we should now permit theexport to Spain of articles which are not war material pure and simple and that inparticular we should allow those items mentioned in the annex to this paper-which are of a semi-military character only that is to say, the dockyard equip-ment, the meteorological equipment, the wireless equipment, ordinary transportvehicles, training aircraft and engines for training aircraft to be supplied fromthe United Kingdom. Apart from purely commercial considerations, mycolleagues will appreciate that it is clearly desirable in the long run, from theService point of view and in the interests of our civil aviation policy, that theSpanish armed forces and Spanish civil aviation should be committed as far aspossible to British production.4. There is the further consideration that if we do not allow the supply ofthese goods from the United Kingdom we may well find the orders being placed inthe United States or elsewhere. We have reason to know that the United states authorities are already offering certain surplus civil aircraft to the Spaniards.Moreover, in a recent telegram about United States-Spanish relations lord halifax stated that the Americans, while disliking General Franco as much aswe do, will not be deterred by this from trying to pick up what commercialadvantages they can from Spain at the present moment. This is confirmed bythe following extract from a despatch just received from His Majesty&apos;s Charged&apos;Affaires in Madrid : &quot;Meanwhile, a full-scale American economic drive in Spain has beengathering way. Spanish business men have visited the United States and returned with promises of quick delivery of a great variety ofcapital goods. The fact that deliveries are not yet materialising has notdiscouraged expectations. United States business men in Spain have beeneagerly seeking orders. Spaniards now see the possibility of re-equippingtheir railways, power plants and other public utility concerns with&quot; theoutput of American factories and any anxiety over the cost is allayed byhints or hopes of long-term credits.&quot;5. All this points to the importance of this country neglecting no oppor-tunity to secure orders for exports to Spain. I trust my colleagues will thereforeagree that no objection should be raised to the supply&apos;to Spain of material andequipment other than arms and munitions of war but which might be regardedas having a semi-military character.12742   [29644]
6. With a view to drawing a distinction between what should and shouldnot be supplied to Spain, I propose, for the consideration of my colleagues, thefollowing formula, which has been drafted in consultation with the service departments and which I would recommend for adoption as a guide to the variousinterested Government Departments when considering Spanish requests for thesupply of equipment of a military or semi-military character :  &quot; While His Majesty&apos;s Government are in present circumstances opposedto the supply to Spain of any arms or munitions of war or other goodsparticularly adapted for warlike uses, they would, on the other hand, haveno objection to the supply to Spain of articles which, though they are generallyof a civilian character, are also capable of use for military purposes.&quot;Under this formula we should be able to supply all the articles in the attachedlist except the anti-aircraft guns and the Bren carriers.7. If this line of action is approved, I would propose to inform the UnitedStates Government of our attitude in this matter.A. E.Foreign Office, 10th A pril, 1945.ANNEX.The Spanish Navy have approached the Admiralty regarding the purchaseof a large amount of naval equipment. One of the items specified is anti-aircraft guns. The remainder consist of dockyard supplies, machinery, &amp;c, required forthe modernisation of the Spanish dockyards and for the new building programmeof the Spanish Navy.The Spanish Air Force have enquired about the purchase of Miles trainingaircraft.The Hispano-Suiza Aircraft Company have enquired about the purchaseof 100 Armstrong-Siddeley &quot; Cheetah &quot; engines of 450 h.p. for fitting to theirconversion trainers.The Miles Aircraft Company have enquired regarding the possibility of selling licences for the manufacture of their training aircraft in Spain.The Spanish Air Ministry have enquired regarding the supply of various items of meteorological, blind-flying and direction-finding equipment, &amp;c, forthe Madrid aerodrome.The Spanish Ministry of War have requested information concerning&quot; certain types of vehicle for all kinds of terrain and especially of the Brencarrier type.&quot;
