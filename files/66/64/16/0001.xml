THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT---     74Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.w.P. (45) 216.5th April, 1945.war cabinet.DOUBLE TAXATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.THE Chancellor in W.P. (45) 1 and W.P. (45) 189 makes proposals for a double Taxation Treaty with the United States. The Cabinet has encouragedan examination of these projects (W.M. (45) 37th Conclusions, Minute 3).(1) Disclosure of Information. .(a) The Chancellor states that the Americans insist on an exchange ofinformation between the taxation authorities of the two countries for theprevention of fraud or avoidance.Any such proposal must be jealously regarded by a country which containsin the City of London an international financial centre the very existence ofwhich depends upon a relationship of unchallengeable trust between the Britishbanker and his overseas client.The Finance Act of 1939, Section 18 (5), specifically safeguards thisrelationship in these terms :-&apos;&apos; Nothing in this section shall impose on any bank the obligation to discloseany particulars relating to income from securities in cases where the personbeneficially entitled to the income is not resident in the United Kingdom.&quot;This is still the law.It would appear, therefore, that the acceptance of the Americans&apos; termsinvolves us in the repeal of a statutory safeguard which Avas believed to benecessary in 1939.(b) The exchange of information will affect holdings by the banks asnominees for clients resident outside the United Kingdom. Figures have been published relating to one clearing bank which reveal that 18 per cent, of its&quot;nominee&quot; holdings are on behalf of such persons. The scale of the businessdirectly affected by the proposed treaty is therefore considerable.(2) United Kingdom Taxation on Revenue derived from American Films.In W.P. (45) 1 the Chancellor puts forward, as an argument in favour ofthe treaty, the fact that the Americans will concede under it the same advan-tageous terms to British film revenues in the United States as are given by usto United States film revenues in this country. But, in order to reach a properestimate of the value of this concession, several facts must be taken into account.(a)  63 million were transferred from this country to the United States inthe five years 1940-44. It is unlikely that the earnings of British films in theUnited States will approach any such figure in the predictable future.(b) Holdings of sterling on behalf of American film renters have been completely unblocked since October 1943, and all the balance of accumulatedfrozen money has been released.(c) It must be understood that, while tax is paid on the profit made byexhibitors and distributors on American films shown in this country, no tax is paid on the balance (amounting, it is believed, to about 70 per cent, of the grosstakings), which is transferred to the producers in the United States under thename of &quot; royalty.&quot;[29601]
2This practice is not only extraordinarily favourable to the Americans but is in sharp contrast to the treatment meted out by the United States taxauthorities to British film companies. If these have no distributing organisation in the United States of America, they are taxed upon the whole of their grossrevenue in America, paying a 30 per cent. Withholding Tax on which no allowance is made for expenses.(d) It will be seen, then, that even during the war the American film industry-has, enjoyed special favours from this country both as to taxation and as to thetransfer of funds. The Chancellor is content that these favours should continue,in return for similar, but belated, treatment for the much smaller earnings ofthe British film industry in.the United States.I suggest that, before decisions are taken, the possibilities of securing forthe British tax authorities a juster proportion of the gross earnings in britain of American film companies should be carefully and thoroughly explored.B. B.Ministry of Information, W.C.I.5th April, 1945.
