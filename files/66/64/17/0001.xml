Reconnaissance of Wilhelmshaven on the 2nd showed the Kdln damaged and low in the water after having been bombed during the U.S. raid on the 30th.It is reported that Leipzig was seen north of Flensburg on the 3rd, with a largehole in her port side probably caused by colliding with Eugen in October 1944.Hipper was seen in dock at Kiel on the 30th; nurnberg is reported to have leftCopenhagen southbound on the 28th.13. In the North Sea and West Baltic there are now only 55 serviceablefloating docks available to the enemy. At Hamburg more than half of theoriginal 34 docks have been lost by bombing, and at Kiel only six out of 15remain. In Norway the enemy has 23 serviceable and three damaged floatingdocks.U-boats.14. There has been a decrease in U-boat activity in Home Waters, and else-where the situation is quiet.Enemy Attack on Shipping.15. During the week one British coaster was sunk, probably by a midget,off Harwich.Provisional shipping losses by enemy action land marine causes during march were 31 ships of 104,224 tons.Allied Minelaying.16. Surface craft, including the Dutch minelayer Willem Van Der Zaan,have laid a large number of mines in Home Waters.Aircraft have laid mines in the approaches to Oslo, in the Kattegat andin the Weser.[29596]b
Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.17.   During the week no minelaying by E-boats was reported.Thirteen mines have been destroyed in the Ostend-Scheidt Channel.On the 18th enemy surface craft were suspected of minelaying west ofLeghorn where six mines have been destroyed.Progress in clearing the Gulf of Cagliari is satisfactory and French mine-sweepers are clearing the approaches to Marseilles.In&apos; the Mediterranean Walrus aircraft have proved so valuable in spottingmines that three minespotting flights have been established at Ancona, Leghornand in the ^gean.The mine totals are 6,495 ground and 9,541 moored.Russian Pacific Shipping in 19M.18. During December 1944, 42 ships carrying 268,750 tons of lend-leasematerials cleared for Russian ports from U.S. and Canadian west coast ports.These sailings, added to the 43 ships carrying 314,000 tons cleared in november and 38 ships carrying 309,300 tons during October, brought the total to1,869,550 tons for the current lend-lease year (1st July to 30th June). Sixty-nineper cent, of the 2,700,000 tons originally scheduled for delivery over the Pacificroute has therefore been despatched during the first half of the lend-lease year.Last year at the same time only 1,481,240 tons, or roughly 55 per cent, of the totalpledged, had been shipped.South American Shipping.19. The Argentine Mercantile Marine has a fleet of about 80 ships totalling350,000 tons, of which 27 ships of 150,000 tons are bankers.Three Chilean ships, which were recently loaded with nitrate at Iquique,caught fire and sank soon after leaving port.
