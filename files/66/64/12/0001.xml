Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 212.1st April, 1945./0war cabinet:\REPORT EOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1945 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated   TERRITORIES.INTEREST in the political field was focussed almost exclusively on the GreyNorth by-election and on its aftermath. The by-election result immediately raised the question of holding a General Election.2. A further development in the conscription issue was the retirement of major-General Pearkes, V.C., from the post of Commanding Officer of the PacificCommand. .General Pearkes&apos;s disagreement with the Governments man-powerpolicy at the time of the Army crisis had been barely concealed, so that his finalbreak with the Government came - s no great surprise.3. The Labour Progressives, i.e., the Communist Party, continued theircampaign in support of the Liberal Party. They have suggested that only a coalition of progressive Liberals and Labour can save Canada.4. The Federal Minister of Labour, Mr. Mitchell, invited the ProvincialMinisters of Labour to a Conference to consider any proposals which will make it possible for provincial authorities to have greater latitude in the establishment of minimum-wage schedules.5. Before the assembly of the Quebec Parliament, the Premier, Mr. Duplessis,published correspondence with Mr. Mackenzie King, in which he attacked theFederal Family Allowance Act passed last summer as unconstitutional. He made it clear that his objections were not to the substance of the Act and, indeed,declared that Quebec was ready to work with the Federal Government for theprovision of family allowances, but he took his stand on the ground that the Actitself was an infringement of provincial rights. Mr. Duplessis subsequentlyintroduced the Bill to allow the Quebec Government to make any agreementdeemed necessary with the Dominion Government for the establishment of asystem of family allowances in conformity with provincial rights and this waspassed by the Provincial Assembly.6. The dispute between the Federal and Saskatchewan Governments overthe question of repayment of the seed grains advance continued without abate-ment. As the amounts due to the Federal Government were not paid by the datedemanded, the Minister of Finance took steps to withhold payments due by theFederal Government to Saskatchewan under the Dominion-Provincial War-time Tax Agreement. The Provincial Government contested the Federal Govern-ment&apos;s action and have demanded the appointment of a tribunal, but this so farhas been refused by the Federal Government. The question is dominated by political rather than financial considerations and each party no doubt has an eyeon the General Election. Mr. Coldwell, the C.C.F. Federal. Leader, has spoken inthe defence of the Province, and the Premier of Alberta, a Social Credit supporter,also favours the C.C.F. Provincial Government on the issue.the dominions.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.[29566]B
27. The Minister of Reconstruction, Mr. Howe, attended a meeting in new york with United States representatives, when agreement was reached on theoperation of civil air services connecting the two countries and also on the carriage of fare-paying passengers by military aircraft.8. Dr. Keenleyside, the Canadian Ambassador to Mexico, presented hiscredentials, and M. clu Hauteclocque has arrived in Ottawa to take up his appoint-ment as the first French Ambassador to Canada.Service A activities.9. On the 13th, H.M.C.S. Orkney (frigate) was damaged in collision in theIrish Sea, while escorting a convoy, but was able to pi^oceed to port.10. During the first half of the month H.M.C.S. Sioux (destroyer) formed part of the escort to a convoy from the United Kingdom which reached Russiaon the 13th. She also formed part of the escort for the return convoj^, duringwhich operation she put into Soroy Island together with three of His Majesty&apos;sdestroyers in order to evacuate some 500 Norwegian civilians who had beenharassed by the enemy.11. On the 22nd, H.M.C.S. Trentonian (corvette) was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat while escorting a convoy off Falmouth; six officers and 89 ratingsbeing picked up.12. During the first week of the month there was nothing of importance toreport on the Canadian sector of the front in N.W. Europe.13. On the 8th, after a heavy air and artillery bombardment, the FirstCanadian Army went over to the offensive South-East of Nijmegen. During thefollowing week ground was gained between the Maas and the Rhine, Cleve andGennep captured, and the greater part of the Reichswrald Forest was cleareddespite widespread floods which made the maintenance of the forward troopsa matter of extreme difficulty.14. Enemy resistance greatly increased during the second week of the offensive and severe flooding continued to hamper operations. Nevertheless,Afferden and Goch on the right of the attack were cleared by the 17th and 19threspectively, while on the left our forward troops reached a point one milesouth of Calcar. The southern bank of the Rhine beino; cleared during; thisperiod to a point opposite Emmerich.15. Steady progress continued to be made against stiff enemy oppositionduring the last few clays of the month with the United Kingdom troops, underthe command of the First Canadian Army, advancing on the right South-Westfrom Goch to occupy the high ground between that town and Udem whencethey pushed on to Weeze, while on the left, United Kingdom and canadian troops launched a strong attack South-West towards the Hochwald Forest.16. On the Italian front there is nothing of operational importance toreport except that certain units of the First Canadian Corps have come out ofthe line on the Eighth Army front.17. A total of 43 R.C.A.F. Squadrons were operational overseas duringthe month of January of which 23 were located in the United Kingdom, 17 onthe Continent, one in Italy and two in Burma. In addition two R.C.A.F. (air.P.) Squadrons have been formed and a third is to form next month.18. Heavy bombers of No. 6 R.C.A.F. Group flew 2,146 sorties during themonth of February which compares with 1,345 sorties for the previous month.The increased number of operations carried out in February was due to betterweather conditions both in this country and over target areas. Main targets for the group were factories, oil refineries and marshalling yards in Germany,during which operations the Group claimed 11 enemy aircraft destroyed, twoprobably destroyed and two damaged for the loss of 25 aircraft which compares with 29 lost in the previous month.19. R.C.A.F. squadrons in Coastal Command flew 165 sorties totalling1,276 operational hours for the loss of six aircraft.20. R.C.A.F. squadrons of the 2nd Tactical Air Force flew 5,246 sorties in February which compares with 2,927 flown in January which can be largelyattributed to improved weather conditions on the Continent.   In spite of the
greater number of operations only 18 enemy aircraft were claimed as destroyed and seven as damaged, which is accounted for by the reduced enemy air activity.26 aircraft of the above squadrons are reported missing.21. The R.C.A.F, Intruder Squadron in Fighter Command flew 135 sortiesduring which it destroyed three enemy aircraft in combat and damaged fourfor the loss of two of our own Mosquitoes.22. Of the three R.C.A.F. Dakota Squadrons of Transport Command one is located in the United Kingdom and two in Burma and these combined flewa record number of 3,407 sorties for the loss of three aircraft which compares with 3,379 sorties for the loss of three aircraft flown in the preceding month.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.23. The Prime Minister, Mr. Curtin, announced several changes in themembers of his Cabinet following the retirement, on medical advice, for a periodof Mr. Beasley from the Ministry of Supply and Shipping. Mr. N. J. O. Makinbecame Minister for Navy, Munitions and Aircraft Production, and SenatorAshley took Mr. Beasley&apos;s Ministry. The Ministry of Post-War Reconstructionis now in the hands of Mr. J. T. Redman, and the new Postmaster-General isSenator D. Cameron, formerly Minister of Aircraft Production. Mr. Beasleywill continue to sit with the Cabinet. While receiving the approval of the press,there was criticism that Mr. Curtin could have made better changes had he notbeen afraid of party factions.24. Three new diplomatic or oversea appointments were announced.Lieutenant-Colonel Ray Hodgson as Minister to France, Mr. Alfred Stirling as high Commissioner to Canada, and Mr. L. R. MacGregor as Minister to Braziland Chile.25. The new session of Parliament was opened by His Royal Highness the duke of Gloucester on the 21st February. The greater part of his speech was devoted to a review of the war situation and the part played by Australia atinternational conferences, &amp;c. The legislative programme includes controversialparty questions such as the national control of air lines and of banking. Therewas considerable support for the suggestion by Mr. Menzies, Leader of theOpposition, for the establishment of a Committee on Foreign Affairs, which, itis felt, would help to inform members and keep foreign policy in properperspective.26. The Federal Cabinet announced its decision that preference in employ-ment after the war should be given to all enlisted members of the fighting servicesand to civilians who in the course of their war work have been brought into actualcontact with the enemy. These decisions are being drafted into a Bill which itis expected will be presented during the present session.27. It was announced in Washington that Commander R. G. A. Jacksonof Australia had been appointed Senior Deputy Director-General of U.N.R.R.A.Economic.28. The Government announced during the month a cut of approximately9 per cent, in the civilian meat ration, to be effective from the 26th February.The reason given for the reduction was a prospective temporary shortage ofsupplies over the next six months, owing to the drought.29. The Ministry of Food representative in Australia states, in this con-nexion, that the saving resulting from the cut is estimated at 40,000 tons a year;since the 1945 allocation for Australian civilian consumption is 531,600 tons andthe estimated requirements on the 1944 ration scale were 570,000 tons, the cutwould seem to bring the ration into line with the allocation and could hardly,therefore, be expected to increase Australia^ exportable surplus.30. Speaking at the Secondary Industries Conference which ended at canberra on the 8th February, the Prime Minister, Mr. Curtin, said that theeconomic policy of the Commonwealth Government after the war would bedirected to maintaining employment at the highest possible level,&quot; &quot; to ensurethat all available resources are employed in ways contributing most effectively to raising standards of living, developing productive capacity, and making-adequate provision for defence.[29566] b 2
31. Mr. Cur tin went on to say that it was proposed to devise means whereby the Government and business managements could work together in drawing up an advance programme for post-war capital expenditure for the whole country.The Government intended to retain complete control of Government-ownedfactories which were necessary for an adequate defence policy.32. Mr. Curtin maintained that the over-riding problem for secondaryindustry was the question of markets. In a condition of high employment, thedemand for imports and the requirements of overseas expenditure generally would tend to be greater than before the war. The development of secondaryindustry in Australia during the war would make possible increased exports ))and manufactured goods. The Commonwealth Government intended to adhere to the policy of adequately protecting industries which were reasonably assured of sound opportunities of success, but this policy would have to be consistent with international obligations. Some industries had grown up in special circum-stances during the war with excessively high costs. It would be wasteful andunreasonable to seek to maintain all industries of this type. The granting of tariff protection would continue to be based on the advice of the Tariff Boardbut the Board would be asked to make regular investigations of the efficiency ofindustries receiving tariff or other forms of assistance from the Government.33. Government policy for the post-war period would be based on the factthat the people,of Australia would not tolerate unemployment and would look to the Government to ensure that unemployment did not arise. If the Govern-ment was to accept this responsibility it would mean an extension of its functions.The choice before industry would be to accept this enlargement of the role ofGovernment and to give co-operation or to return to the catastrophes which accompanied the individualism of pre-war capitalism.34. Speaking of some big immediate post-war problems, namely, the riskof inflation, the shortage of housing and the pent-up demand for imports,Mr. Curt-ih said that these could be overcome only by the retention in a modifiedform of the machinery for controlling prices, for establishing priority in thebuilding industry and for preventing unnecessary overseas expenditure.35. The Governments of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of SouthAfrica have agreed to a meeting; to consider matters arising out of the accumu-lation of wool purchased by the United Kingdom Government from the Dominionsunder war-time arrangements, and in particular how these stocks may be bestdisposed of concurrently with future clips of Dominion wool. The meeting isdue to open in London on the 16th April. Representatives will consist of officials and technical experts and will report back to their respective Governments with-out commitment.Service A activities..36:   H.M.A.S. Lachlan was commissioned on the 14th of the month, whileone destroyer and five frigates are at present fitting out after launching.37. The strength of the Australian Army, excluding the Volunteer DefenceCorps, was on the 3rd of the month 379,129 males, 24,283 females, totalling403.412.38. Troops of the First Australian Army in the Solomon Islands andBismarck Archipelago have been engaged in the following operations during thecourse of the last month.39. In New Britain troops of the Fifth Australian Division have advancedalong the north coast of the island without encountering strong enemy opposition,except for a clash which occurred in the Orpen Bay area during the first half ofthe month. On the south side of the island elements of the same division havepushed forward in the face of an elusive enemy. By the end of the month theenemy had been confined to an area north of the line Orpen Bay-Wide Bay andwas only in light contact with our troops.40. On Bougainville Island troops nf the Third-Australian Division haveconsiderably expanded the Original perimeter in Tarokina Bay. On the 6th ofthe month Tsimba Ridge, which is some 50 miles north of the original perimeterand had been holding up the northward advance of our forces, was captured,.and since then the Genga River has been crossed and positions on the far bankconsolidated.  Contact in this area is at present limited to patrol clashes.
41. Progress has also been made to the south where a point some 30 milesfrom the perimeter has been reached while, inland, ground has been capturedwhich overlooks Numa Numa on the east coast of the island.42. On New Guinea in the Aitape sector troops of the Sixth AustralianDivision have cleared the coastal area in the face of aggressive enemy patrollingfor a distance of some 50 miles east of the town. Enemy casualties in this area from the 3rd November to the 23rd February have been 1,549 killed and64 captured.43. The following aircraft were produced in Australia during the month ofFebruary : Beaufighters 26, Mosquitoes 10 and Wirraways 7, while the total staff employed in aircraft production and maintenance as on the 15th of the monthcomprised 26,031 males and 8,791 females.NEW ZEALAND.44. The future of United Kingdom exports continued to be discussed, andthe reply by the Board of Trade to the Associated Chambers of Commerceindicating, inter alia, that delay in the resumption of exports will not be as longas had previously been expected, was also reported. New Zealand export figuresindicate an increase, and it is expected that they will be further increased inthe coming year.45. The Minister of Supply, Mr. Sullivan, issued a statement that rationinghas resulted in more meat and butter being made available for Britain.46. The Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser, stated that no agreement exists betweenthe Australian and New Zealand Governments for the nationalisation of internalair lines.Service Activities.47. On the 15th, H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles arrived at Auckland, where she isnow refitting.48. In Italy, troops of the Second New Zealand Division have been in theline during the course of the month.49. Consequent on the contraction in the Empire Air. Training Plan anumber of air force stations in New Zealand have been closed and the reductionin personnel for the six months ending December last has been approximately 6,000.50. Eight Corsair aircraft of the R.N.Z.A.F. which were operating in the forward area of the Pacific have been lost during a severe thunderstorm which sodamaged their navigational instruments that they ceased to function.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.51. The motion of censure moved by Dr. Malan, Leader of the Opposition,against the Government for inadequate plans for dealing with food, health and social security, was defeated by 98 votes to 45. General Smuts, the PrimeMinister, meeting the Opposition^ accusation that the food shortage resulted from exports of food made, or permitted by, the Government, reminded theHouse that South Africa was an exporting country and had agreed to supplyother African Territories; when, however, food had become short in the Union,these exports had been cut down. The main cause of the food shortage was theincrease in food consumption within the Union. On the subject of a national health service, General Smuts said that one of the difficulties was the fact thatthe National Convention had given the Provinces certain rights which could notbe hastily over-ruled. A few days later it was announced that the Provinces andthe Government had now come to an agreement on the main principles of theapplication of the national health services scheme. Legislation for social securitywas to be introduced during the present session.52. During the debate on the Part Appropriation Bill, Dr. Malan, leader of the Opposition, attacked the Yalta Agreement and defended his earlier attitudewhen he had said that Britain had lost the war. He contended that this view was widely held at the time and that South Africa was more to him than the wholeof the British Empire. He repudiated that idea that the Nationalist Party wasa Nazi party. General Smuts, in reply, said he knew that what Dr. Malan had said was meant to whitewash himself, to apologise for himself, and correct what
had been wrong in his attitude in the past five years. There was the world of difference between his attitude and Mr. Churchill&apos;s, and the people of SouthAfrica knew him and would not accept his apology.53. The Natal Indian Congress sent a message to the Viceroy, the Secretaryof State for India. Mr. Gandhi, and others, asking that the new High Commis-sioner for India in the Union should not leave to take up his appointment untilthe Pegging Act is repealed and the recent Natal Ordinances have been vetoed.It is understood that all the four recent Ordinances passed by the ProvincialCouncil of Natal have been found to be ultra vires. It is thought that the UnionGovernment may be contemplating legislation on the Indian question in theUnion Parliament.54. Announcing in the Assembly that the Air Conference for southern africa would meet at Cape Town on the 20th March, at which all british territories in Africa would be represented, the Minister of Transport,Mr. Sturrock, said it was hoped to have similar discussions with South Africa&apos;sBelgian and Portuguese neighbours. On the policy of the Union government towards post-war civil aviation, Mr. Sturrock said that it was proposed tomaintain the principle of national sovereignty of the air and that the Unionsupported the United Kingdom plan at the recent Montreal and ChicagoConferences.55. The Governments immediate social security proposals were embodied in a White Paper. They are estimated to cost  16,350.000 by 1947-48. Themain proposals are the maximum old age pension to be raised to  60 yearly andthe means limit made more liberal, improved grants under the Children&apos;s Actand the payment of allowances to poor families for a third and subsequent child,and expansion of the scope of existing unemployment benefit arrangements tocover more persons.Economic.56. The Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Strauss, announced in the assembly that the current season&apos;s wheat crop is estimated at 4,200,000 bags, which is1.800,000 bags short of requirements. Mr. Strauss also said that, although itwas too early to give an exact estimate, it was feared that the maize crop would fall far short of normal, and the utmost economy was therefore necessary.Service A ctiviti.es.57. The crew of the second South African frigate, which is to be known asH.M.S.A.S. Natal, left for the United Kingdom early in the month. On the 18thH.M.S.A.S. Pretoria (Third Escort Group) sailed from Capetown, where she hadbeen for radar fitment.58. H.M.S.A. Ships Southern Sea and Southern Isles (whalers), returning to the Union after an absence of almost exactly four years, arrived at Durbanon the 27th December, when they reverted to S.A.N.F. &quot;control. H.M.S.A. shipsBluff, Babiana and A ristea were handed back to their owners Messrs. Irvine andJohnson on the 27th December.59. H.M.S.A.S. Africana (salvage vessel) sailed from Walvis Bay on the8th of the month to render assistance to H.M.S. Oxnu (trawler), which had goneaground in Sandwich Harbour.60. 6th South African Armoured Division was in the line on the FifthArmy front during the month, where nothing beyond vigorous patrolling tookplace. As the result of reorganisation, the 6th South African Armoured Divisionnow consists of the 11th Armoured Brigade of three armoured regiments and the12th and 13th Motor brigades, each of three battalions.61. Various units of the South African Engineering Corps, including sevenField Companies, two Road Construction Companies and an army Field ParkCompany, operated in Italy and North Africa under command of A.F.H.Q. duringthe month of December.62. According to the latest co-ordinated reports for December 1944, fogand rain restricted..the effort of the S.A.A.F. in Italy and Yugoslavia.63. Squadrons of No. 2 Wing, in addition to bombing targets in North-East Italy and Yugoslavia, transported troops and supplies to Greece.
64. Marauder squadrons of No. 3 Wing attacked stores dumps in theCastel-Bolognese and San Alberto areas during the first half of the month, whileduring the latter half marshalling yards formed the main targets.65. On the 2nd December squadrons of No. 7 Wing flew 153 sorties largely in support of the Canadians clearing Russi, while on the 11th an enemy tankpenetration into the Canadian lines was beaten back. During the last few days of the month rail targets were attacked in North-East Italy.66. Squadrons of No. 8 Wing continued attacking enemy communicationsduring the month of December and also acted in close support of the Army.EIRE.67. An Air Transport Agreement between the Government of Eire and theGovernment of the United States was completed at Washington. The Agreementgives to Eire the right to operate air services to America, and it is understoodthat the Government may purchase aircraft in the United States to enable an Eiretrans-Atlantic service to be established.Economic.68. A return issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerceshowed that exports to Northern Ireland in 1944 were, at  5,600,000, more thandouble the value of those in 1939, but imports from Northern Ireland remainedmuch the same at something under the  1 million mark. The cattle trade and increased flax production are the main sources of the export &quot;boom&quot; in this market.69. In 1943 and 1944 imports from other countries exceeded in value those from Great Britain. This was due to the low level of imports from Britain,whilst imports from Canada (mostly wheat) were high. Imports from the UnitedStates and other countries were also heavy.70. The following are the figures representing trade between Eire and GreatBritain :  Imports. Exports.   1939      ............      23,406,063 22,175.0291940      ............      24,196,547 28,134,9861941      ............      20,554,956 27,463.0061942      ............       18,789,420 27,102,0881943      ............       12,564,837 22,243.5411944      ............       12,249,306 23.457,151Similar figures for Eire and Northern Ireland were :-193919401941194219431944Imports. 763,437633,996556.8401,038,060487.839828.779Exports. 2,637,3243,311,1103,350.2685.101,7174.844,1275.689.220Trade with other countries :  1 m ports.

The above figures are based on war prices, and are not a fair guide sofar as normal quantitative trade is concerned.72. Total trade, which amounted to  70,315,503 in 1939, rose to\ 79.763,979in 1940 and dropped to  61,361,659 in 1941. The.total for 1942 was  67,296.407.In 1943 the total value was  53,561,903, and in 1944 only  47,853,988.73. Under emergency conditions necessitating direct wheat imports, a riseis shown in imports from Canada from  1,461,903 in 1939 to  4,564,996 in 1942.
In 1943 the value fell to  2,544.563; in 1944 it reached the highest figure, 5,017,132.74. Imports from United States rose from  3,600,052 in 1939 to  4,130,920in 1940. In 1941 the value declined to  2,304.066 and rose again to  3,041,939in 1942. For 1943 and 1944 the figures were  3,550,624 and  2,955,387respectively.75. Imports from Argentina rose from  2,327,121 in 1939 to  3,815,603 in1940. and dropped considerably in the next two years. Last year&apos;s figure was 1.620,951.76. Publication of details of imports and exports had been suspended since August 1939.77. Exchequer returns for the period the 1st April, 1944, to the10th February, 1945, show that revenue ( 38,796,528) exceeded expenditure( 37.785,195) by  1,011.333. For the corresponding period last year revenue( 37,199,015) was the greater by  1,949,836.78. The reports of the Revenue Commissioners for the four years 1940-43show in practically all cases either a uniform level of receipts or an actualincrease.79. Income tax, sur-tax, and super-tax yields rose from  6 million odd in1940 to  10 million in 1943.80. A considerable drop in imports did not unduly affect the customs revenue ( 10,700,000) in 1943. It represented a decrease of only  45,000 on its1940 counterpart.81. The following figures show net receipts in income tax, sur-tax andsuper-tax :  1940      ............... 6,078,1911941      ............... 7,540,0411942      ............... 9,436.9471943      ............... 10,118,966Customs revenue on the ad valorem basis : &apos;1940      ................. 10,764,6371941       ............... 11,829,5761942      ............... 11,026,1271943      ............... 10,718,89082. The Minister for Agriculture stated in the Dail that he did not proposeto open negotiations with the British Government with a view to a long-termagreement regarding export of agricultural commodities, and that he was not satisfied that it would be more advantageous than the present system of securingthe best terms possible for a reasonable time ahead.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.General.British India.83.   No political developments were reported during February.84. The budget session of the Legislative Assembly opened on the8th February. The combination of Congress and Moslem. League members againstthe Government, which was a feature of last year&apos;s budget session, is apparentlybeing repeated this year, though it is not to be taken as evidence in any otherrespect of a reconciliation of aims between the Congress and the League. during february the Government of India suffered six &quot;defeats&quot; in the Assembly;four of the motions were on matters arising out of the Railway budget and onerelated to the forced sale of Savings Certificates. The other occasion was a vote of censure on the Government of India for their failure to enforceeconomic sanctions against South Africa and to refrain from replacing the outgoing Indian High Commissioner. The new High Commissioner was already on his way when the debate took place, and arrived in South africa on the 24th February. But the debate displayed the continued concern in indian the matter of the status of Indians in the Union.
Indian States.85. Towards the end of the month the Crown Representative received aletter from the Nawab of Bhopal who had resigned from the Chancellorship ofthe Chamber of Princes, in company with the Pro-Chancellor and the elected members of the Standing Committee, last December suggesting that freshelections should be held and a meeting of the full Chamber called as soon aspossible. It had been clear for some time that a growing body of Princelyopinion was convinced of the unwisdom of these precipitate resignations, but it remains to be decided what procedure would be appropriate to enable the officebearers to resume their functions.Foreign and Frontier Relations.86. Afghanistan. The internal situation remained quiet. The AfghanGovernment have as yet taken no action against Mazrak though they were reported still to be contemplating forcible action to remove him from the vicinity of the Frontier.87. The Prime Minister stayed at Jalalabad and took the opportunity to investigate more closely than could be done at Kabul the activities of the governor of the Eastern Province and his subordinate officials. As a result a certainamount of maladministration was brought to light and disciplinary action wastaken.88. As a result of a visit by the Afghan Militaiy Mission to Indian, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have now been asked to indicate the availability and costof various types of military aircraft. The Mission also showed some interestin American aircraft.89. North-West Frontier. This winter has been more than usually severeand the frontier remained quiet.90. Tibet.-The Tibetan authorities decided to close down the Englishschool which was opened at Lhasa in July of last year. This decision appears tohave been taken as a result of pressure from the Monasteries who have through-out maintained an unfriendly attitude towards the school. It is possible thattheir antipathy to the school may have been stimulated by Mr. Shen, the Chinesedelegate, who is still in Lhasa and who has been in close touch with theMonasteries. Although the decision was not entirely unexpected it is, none theless, a blow to our prestige. The Government of India felt it best on the whole to accept the decision, but instructed their representative in Lhasa to remind theTibetan Government that the school was opened at their own request.Economic.91. Hydari Mission. A delegation from the Government of India, headed by Sir Akbar Hydari, has been in London during the past month discussing a wide range of problems connected with India&apos;s requirements of imports and the diversion of orders for military requirements from Indian production, in orderthat the economy of India may be thereby assisted to support military operations from an Indian base.   These discussions still continue.92. Food. The atmosphere of the Fifth All-India Food Conference heldat Delhi recently showed a marked increase of confidence and of co-operationbetween the several administrations. The decisions and recommendations of theConference dealt, among other subjects, with &quot;monopoly of procurement&quot; ofgrains by Provincial Governments; the extension of rationing with a basic ration of 1 lb. of cereals per diem for each adult; examination of diets in order toimprove nutrition; estimates of supply and demand in respect of such food aseggs, poultry, fish, vegetables and milk with a view to increased production;quicker and more even movement of food-grains; the organisation of markets;increased production and use of manures and improved supply of agricultural implements, machinery and material.93. Over 460 towns, covering approximately 43 million people, are nowrationed. The Food Department is pressing vigorously for the establishment ofindustrial canteens and is endeavouring to educate the population on nutritionalvalues. An ambitious programme for the supply of agricultural machinery, &amp;c.,for use in the Grow More Food campaign, is now under examination by theHydari Mission with appropriate Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government.[29566] c
It has.not been found possible to provide shipping space for the full programmeof food-grain imports submitted by the Government of India, but it is hoped tomake substantial quantities available throughout the first half of 1945 by ship-ments as flatting in the military ships.Finance.94. Indian Budget for 1945-46. The Budget was presented by the FinanceMember on the 28th February. The main figures (before taking account of thenew taxation proposals) are given in the following table : &amp; millions.1944-45 1944-45 1945-46Budget Revised BudgetEstimate. Estimate. Estimate.Revenue         .........      231 268 266Civil Expenditure    ......        64 87 93Defence Expenditure debitableto Revenue.........      208 298 296Deficit      ......        41 117 123Defence Expenditure debitableto both Revenue and Capital      226 342 309Revenue is buoyant. The growth of civil expenditure is largely due to increasingcosts over a wide field. Of these the biggest single item (accounting for an increaseof about  10 million in the last two columns) is under interest charges, whichreflect the success of the Government of India&apos;s borrowing campaign. Thedominating feature, however, is clearly the spectacular increase in defence expenditure, which is due mainly to the Japanese invasion, higher pay for thetroops and heavier provision for reciprocal aid. All experience suggests thatthe defence figure entered in the 1945-46 Budget will, in the event, be exceeded.95.   New Tax Proposals.(a) Direct taxation  &apos;(i) Provision is to be made for allowances in respect of deprecia-tion and of expenditure on scientific research similar tothat announced in the last United Kingdom Budget speech,(ii) For the first time an earned income allowance similar to thatin force in the United Kingdom is to be introduced inIndia.(iii) The rate &quot;of income tax on incomes above  1,125 is to beincreased.(b) Indirect taxation (i) Increased customs and excise duties on tobacco are proposed.(ii) Certain postal and telegraph rates are to be enhanced.The net effect of these proposals is estimated to be an increased revenue of 6^ million, reducing the deficit to  116^ million.96. Borrowing. The Finance Member announced that the very satisfactoryfigure of  215 million had been invested by the public in the twelve months fromFebruary 1944 to January 1945, and that the total proceeds of public loans sincethe beginning of the war have reached the impressive total of  625 million. the borrowing programme had made a very significant contribution to the generalsuccess of the Governments anti-inflationary measures during the past year.97. Sterling balances. The Finance Member referred to the case which was presented by the Indian Delegation at the Bretton Woods Conference and tothe negotiations which would have to take place with the United KingdomGovernment. These, he said, could not usefully be entered upon at least until theend of the war with Germany.98. Planning and development. ^The Finance Member stressed the impossi-bility of proceeding with the execution of plans until the war had ended, and alsothe need for developing the financial resources which would be required for thepurpose. Apart from new taxation, of which he quoted some examples, he thoughtthat the question of national ownership of industry ought to be considered fromthe point of view of its potentialities as a source of revenue.
India and the War.99.   Royal Indian Navy.H.M.I.S. Nasik commissioned on the 24th January.H.D.M.L. 1268 commissioned on the 29th January.M.L. 421 commissioned on the 31st January.H.M.I.S. Shivaji, the new Mechanical Training Establishment at Lonavla,commissioned on the 15th February.H.M.S. Bugloss was transferred to the Royal Indian Navy and re-commis-sioned as H.M.I.S. Assam on the 19th February.H.M.I.S. Narbada and Jumna were engaged in the support of operations onthe Arakan Coast and units of the Coastal Forces have also participated. they received the congratulations and thanks of all the Commanders concerned for their good work which contributed in great measure to the success of the operations.Military.Mediterranean.100. There was no change so far as the employment of the Indian Divisionswas concerned. General Mark Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied armies in Italy, in an interview recently paid the following tribute to the &apos;: splendidfighting record &quot; of the Indian troops under his command : &quot; I have the distinction of having had in my command a trio of greatIndian divisions, the 4th, 8th and 10th, whose fighting record in Italy is asplendid one. No obstacle has succeeded in delaying these troops or loweringtheir high morale and fighting spirit. Recently in the Serchio Valley theGerman counter-attack was stopped and thrown back by troops which included the bulk of the 8th Indian Division.&quot;Burma.101. Operations moved with success on all fronts during the month and approximately half of Burma has been cleared of the enemy.102. 15th Corps Front. The occupation of Ramree and Cheduba Islandswas completed. Artillery, Naval and Air action greatly impeded Japaneseattempts to extricate the remnants of their garrison and caused many casualties.Kangaw was cleared of the enemy by the 20th February. Operations on the mainland East of Ramree Island designed to cut off and destroy the remnantsof the Japanese forces in the Arakan were continued successfully. Difficultiesdue to the ground caused more delay than enemy opposition.103. 4th Corps Front. A bridgehead was successfully established at Paganon the east bank of the Irrawaddy south of its confluence with the Chindwin, andour troops made progress southwards towards the oilfields on both sides of theIrrawaddy against stifnsh opposition. At the same time other troops, includingarmour, advanced rapidly eastwards towards Meiktila, capturing several airstrips in excellent condition and many supply dumps intact.104. 33rd Corps Front. Considerable opposition was encountered in theSagaing area west of Mandalay. Nevertheless our troops successfullyestablished bridgeheads on the left bank of the Irrawaddy and withstood allcounter-attacks, in which they inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. the capture of Saye north of the river brought our forces within sight of the pagodasof Mandalay.105. Further north a bridgehead was established and extended at Singu.Singu itself was taken and progress made to the south and east of it againstlessening opposition.106. Northern Combat Area, Command. The most marked advances duringthe month were made in this area. In the last fortnight Chinese troops advanced50 miles to within 25 miles of Lashio. Bawdwin and Namtu, 25 miles W.N.W.of Lashio, were captured. It was reported that no serious damage had been done to the extensive silver and lead mines at the former place.A ir.107. The successful operations outlined above were.only made possible bythe use of air transport on a quite unprecedented scale for the carriage of menand material, for supply dropping and the evacuation of casualties. There isno railway from the very mountainous Indo-Burma land frontier down into[29566] d
central Burma. Roads have been constructed but these are liable to floods andlandslides and are in any case insufficient for the purposes of supply. This large-scale air transport in turn was only made possible because of overwhelmingcombatant superiority in the air.108. In addition to air supply direct air support of all ground forces wascarried out. on an impressive scale. At Kangaw, where particularly stubbornopposition was encountered, fighter bombers fleAv over a thousand sorties a day.Very successful strikes were also carried out by medium and heavy bombers. AtSingu fighter bombers flew over 1,800 sorties in addition to the daily and nightlyoperations of the ground-attack fighters.   Heavy bombers also co-operated.109. Strategic bombing of airfields, oilfields, Rangoon, the Burma-Siamrailway and the Isthmus of Kra was also carried out. The 1,100-foot bridge atKanchanaburi in Siam on the Burma-Siam Railway was successfully wrecked.The weather throughout was favourable and a large number of successful sorties were flown.General.110. Cinemas. The cinema situation in the .14th Army has improved.There are now 30 dual projector mobile units in the forward areas. One completesection of 10 units is being moved to the 14th Army and 5 more sections each of10 units are being raised.111. Live Entertainment: (a) ENS A. There are now 15 parties operating in Allied Land Forces area,(b) Indian Shows. The position has improved both as regards number and quality.   5 large and 10 miniature parties are now performing in the area.112. Post-War Problems. Indian troops who have served overseas in north africa and- Europe have had more contact with Western conditions than thosewho have not served outside India, One result of this is that overseas troopsshow an increasing tendency to insist on the need for better education of theIndian masses in the post-war area.113. Remoimts. 27,115 Mules/Ponies/Donkeys have been purchased,shipped and landed in India from South Africa to date.114. A total of 9,733 animals has been supplied to the Chinese forces to date.115. Recovered Indian Army Prisoners of War. The following total numbers have arrived in India : Officers. V.C.Os.    I.O.Rs.

There are reports that the Maha Barna Asi Ayone (the recentlyreorganised totalitarian party) has not been a success owing to differences betweenMajor-General Aung San (chief of the Burma National Army) and Dr. Ba Mawand the unpopularity of the latter among the majority of political-mindedBurmans.118. There have been some hints of a secret resistance movement amongdisillusioned members of the Burma National Army.
Liberated Burma.119.   Reports continue to be received showing that the reception of allied troops by the Burmans is good and that mutual confidence is being restored.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State  or the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and mandated territories, and &quot;Colonial Governors&quot; is used to include high commissioners and the British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic A ffairs.Food Supplies.Ceylon.120. In view of the cancellation by Brazil of 20,000 tons Rice for Ceylonreferred to in my report for last month, the United States authorities have now agreed to release from their stocks 15,200 tons, and it is hoped that shipment of this quantity will be arranged during March and April.121. Owing to delay in shipment of Egyptian Rice, it has been necessaryto supplement Ceylon&apos;s stocks of Rice by the shipment from India of 10,000 tons.The Government of India agreed to this release on the understanding thatreplacement of a similar quantity of Rice, preferably from Egypt, would bemade by the end of July 1945. Ministry of Food and Ministry of War Transporthave agreed to this undertaking being given.122. The Rice supply position continues most difficult but the importanceof maintaining Ceylon&apos;s requirements at the rate programmed for the first six months of 1945, namely, 18,000 tons per month, is fully recognised, and every endeavour is being made to meet the Island&apos;s needs from supplies expected tobe available from the current Egyptian crop.British Guiana Bauxite.123. Reference was made in my Report for November last to the difficultiesof the British Guiana bauxite industry owing to the cessation of purchases ofaluminum by the Ministry of Aircraft Production from Canada, which drawsthe raw material from British Guiana. These difficulties have been temporarilyovercome by the United States Government placing an order in Canada for the delivery of 75,000 tons of aluminium by the end of July next.East Africa Cotton.124. An agreement has recently been concluded between the East african governments and the Government of India whereby such cotton as is not takenby the Ministry of Supply under their contract, underwriting the East Africancrop, or by Ceylon, will be sold to India at prices to be negotiated yearly. this contract will run for the period of the Ministry of Supply&apos;s contract with EastAfrica, i.e., to cover one sowing after termination of hostilities with Japan.Defence.125. At the invitation of General Sir Oliver Leese, the Duke of Devonshireis now in South-East Asia Command. He will attend a conference in Calcutta,at which General Officers Commanding-in-Chief, East Africa and West Africa,will be present, where various questions concerning the welfare and administra-tion of African Troops will be discussed. He is also visiting Colonial Forcesin the Command.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.126. The lull in terrorist activities continued during the month. The policecontinued energetic anti-terrorist measures which have resulted in -a number ofarrests, including that of the operational chief of the Irgun Zvai Leumi, whoconfessed to authorship of attacks on Government property during last year.Seven more detainees were deported to the Sudan during the month.   Total
deportations are 286, of whom 18 had been released and returned to Palestineafter consideration of their cases by an Official Committee sent from palestine to the Sudan for this purpose.127. Dr. Weizmann intends to leave Palestine shortly. Immigrationcontinues to exercise the Jewish public, whose leaders are manoeuvring for the speedy fulfilment of the authorised quota in the hope that Government will be forced to approve further immigration.128. Among Arab political parties and leaders there is a widespread hopethat the Rulers of the Arab States will save the situation without any help from palestine other than the good offices of Musa el Ala mi. He has continued his activities among neighbouring Arab States.129. Considerable speculation, of course, resulted among all parties fromthe visit of President Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill to Egypt and the meetingsthey held there.Borneo.130. The Borneo Civil Affairs Planning Unit is now in course of proceeding to Australia, where it will assemble and finalise its preparations for work in liberated Borneo. Six members of the Unit have left this country by air, andthe remainder (with the exception of a small rear link) will follow very shortlyby sea.Gibraltar.131. Sir Findlater Stewart, who has been appointed Commissioner toexamine the problems involved in the repatriation of the remaining Gibraltarianevacuees, visited some of the camps in Northern Ireland in which the evacueesare at present accommodated.British Guiana.132. A serious fire occurred on the 23rd February in the commercial quarterof Georgetown. A considerable number of Government and commercial buildings were destroyed, including both banks and the post office. Supplies of food-stuffswere not, however, seriously affected and casualties were light, one man beingkilled and another seriously injured. To meet the situation created by thedestruction of the banks the Government Treasury is meeting cheques endorsed by the bank managers for essential services.133. The Royal Society Library and Museum were also unfortunatelydestroyed.
