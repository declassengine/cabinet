I have drafted my latest message to Marshal Stalinin the name of the War Cabinet.

ANNEX. I.Prime Minister to President Roosevelt. No. 925.   27.3.45.(Personal and Top Secret.)I am extremely concerned at the deterioration of the Russian attitudesince Yalta.2. About Poland, you will have seen that Molotov, in his reply to the agreedcommunication made to him by our Ambassadors on the 19th March, and intheir discussion on the 23rd March, returned a series of flat negatives on every point he dealt with and ignored others. He persists in his view that the Yaltacommunique merely meant the addition of a few other Poles to the existingadministration of Russian puppets and that these puppets should be consultedfirst. He maintains his right to veto Mikolajczyk and other Poles we may suggestand pretends that he has insufficient information about the names we have putforward long ago. Nothing is said about our proposal that the commission should preside in an arbitral capacity over discussions among the Poles. Nothingon our point that measures in Poland affecting the future of the Polish State and action against individuals and groups likely to disturb the atmosphere should be avoided. He ignores his offer about observers and. tells us to talk to the Warsawpuppets about this. It is as plain as a pike staff that his tactics are to drag thebusiness out while the Lublin Committee consolidate their power.3. Clark Kerr&apos;s proposal for dealing with this was to try by redraftingto build something on the four-point formula included in Molotov&apos;s reply. Wecannot see that any real progress towards getting an honest Polish settlement canpossibly be made in this way. It would merely mean that we allowed ourcommunication to be side-tracked, negotiated on the basis of Molotov&apos;s whollyunsatisfactory reply and wasted time finding formulae which do not decide vitalpoints. We therefore instructed Clark Kerr that he should not proceed on this basis, and that we are discussing matters with you.4. As you know, if we fail altogether to get a satisfactory solution on poland and are in fact defrauded by Russia, both Eden and I are pledged to reportthe fact openly to the House of Commons. There I advised critics of the Yaltasettlement to trust Stalin. If I have to make a statement of facts to the House,the whole world will draw the deduction that such advice was wrong. All themore so that our failure in Poland will result in a set up there on the newRoumanian model. In other words, Eastern Europe will be shown to be excludedfrom the terms of the declaration on Liberated Europe and you and we shall be excluded from any jot of influence in that area.5. Surely we must not be manoeuvred into becoming parties to imposing on poland, and on how much more of Eastern Europe, the Russian version of democracy&apos;? (You no doubt saw Vyshinsky&apos;s public explanations in Roumania ofthis doctrine.) There seems to be only one possible alternative to confessing our total failure. That alternative is to stand by our interpretation of the Yaltadeclaration. But I am convinced it is no use trying to argue this any further with Molotov. In view of this, is it not now the moment for a message from usboth on Poland to Stalin ? I will send you our rough idea on this in my immediately following.   I hope you can agree.6. I see nothing else likely to produce good results. If we are rebuffed, itwill be a very sinister sign, taken with the other Russian actions at variance withthe spirit of Yalta; such as Molotov&apos;s rude questioning of our word in the caseof Crossword, the unsatisfactory proceedings over our liberated german prisoners, the coup cVEtat in Roumania, the Russian refusal to allow the declara-tion on liberated Europe to operate, and the blocking of all progress in the E.A.C.by the Russians.7. What also do you make of Molotov&apos;s withdrawal from San Francisco?It leaves a bad impression on me. Does it mean that the Russians are going to runout or are they trying to blackmail us ? As we have both understood them, theDumbarton Oaks proposals, which will form the basis of discussion at san francisco, are based on the conception of Great Power unity. If no such unityexists on Poland, which is after all a major problem of the post-war settlement to[29564] b
2say nothing of the other matters just mentioned what, it will legitimately beasked, are the prospects of success of the new world organisation ? And is it notindeed evident that, in the circumstances, we shall be building the whole structure of future world peace on foundations of sand ?8. I believe, therefore, that if the success of San Francisco is not to be gravely imperilled, we must both of us now make the strongest possible appeal toStalin about Poland and, if necessary, about any other derogations from theharmony of the Crimea. Only so shall we have any real chance of getting theworld organisation established on lines which will commend themselves to our respective public opinions. Indeed, I am not sure that we should not mention toStalin now the deplorable impression Molotov&apos;s absence from San Francisco will cause.ANNEX II.Prime Minister to President Roosevelt. No. 926.   27.3.45.(Personal and Top Secret.)My immediately preceding telegram.Could we not both tell him that : Begins:We are distressed that the work of the Polish Commission is held up becausemisunderstandings have arisen about the interpretation of the Yalta decisions.The agreed purpose of those decisions was that a new Government of national unity was to be established after consultations with representatives of Lublinand other democratic Poles which both our Governments could recognise. Wehave not got any reply on the various Polish names we have suggested, pleadinglack of information. We have given him plenty of information. There ought notto be a veto by one Power on all nominations. We consider that our nominationsfor the discussions have been made in the spirit of confidence which befits Allies;and of course there could be no question of allowing Lublin to bar them.. We will accept any nominations he puts forward, being equally confident that the SovietGovernment will not suggest pro-Nazi or anti-Democratic Poles. The assembledPoles should then discuss the formation of a new Government among themselves.The Commission should preside as arbitrators to see fail&apos; play. Monsieur Molotovwants the Lublinites to be consulted first. The communique does not providefor this. But we have no objection to his seeing them first. We cannot authoriseour representatives to do so since we think it contrary to the spirit of the communique. Also, to our surprise and regret Molotov, who suggested at an earlier stage that we might like to send observers, has now withdrawn the offer.Indeed, he appears to suggest it had never been made; and has suggested that weshould apply to the present Warsaw administration. Stalin will understand thatthe whole point of the Yalta decision was to produce a Polish Government wecould recognise and that we obviously cannot therefore deal with the present administration. We feel sure he will honour the offer to send observers and his influence with his Warsaw friends is so great that he will overcome with easeany reluctance they may show in agreeing.2. Also, Stalin will surely see that while the three Great Allies are arranging for the establishment of the new Government of National Unity, those in power in Poland should not prejudice the future. We have asked that the SovietGovernment should use their influence with their friends in temporary powerthere.   Stalin will, we feel confident, take steps to this end.3. Stalin will find all this set out in most reasonable terms in our communica-tion of the 19th March. Will he cast his eye over it and judge whether oursuggestions are not all in line with the spirit of the Yalta decision, and should they not all be met by our Ally in order that the aim of the Yalta settlement ofPoland, viz., the setting up of a representative Government which Britain andthe U.S.A. can recognise, may be carried out without further delay.
ANNEX III.To Prime Minister from President Roosevelt. No. 727.   29.3.45.(Personal and Top Secret.)The following interchange of messages between Marshal Stalin and myselfis quoted for your information : -&quot;President to Marshal Stalin, 24th March, 1945.Ambassador Gromyko has just informed the State Department of the composition of the Soviet delegation to the San Francisco Conference. &quot;while we have the highest regard for Ambassador Gromyko&apos;s character and capabilities and know that he would ably represent his country, I cannot helpbeing deeply disappointed that Mr. Molotov apparently does not plan toattend. Recalling the friendly and fruitful co-operation at Yalta between mr. Molotov, Mr. Eden and Mr. Stettinius, I know the Secretary of State has\ been looking forward to continuing the joint work in the same spirit at san francisco for the eventual realisation of our mutual goal, the establishmentof an effective international organisation to insure a secure and peacefulfuture for the world.Without the presence of Mr. Molotov the Conference will be deprived ofa very great asset. If his pressing and heavy responsibilities in the soviet union make it impossible for him to stay for the entire Conference, I verymuch hope that you will find it possible to let him come at least for the vitalopening sessions. Since all sponsoring Powers and the majority of othercountries attending will be represented by their Ministers for Foreign Affairs,I am afraid that Mr. Molotov&apos;s absence will be construed all over the world as a lack of comparable interest on the part of the Soviet Government in thegreat objectives of this Conference.&quot;&quot;Marshal Stalin to President, 27th March.We extremely value and attach great importance to the forthcoming conference at San Francisco, called to found the international organisationof peace and security for peoples, but circumstances have developed in sucha way that Mr. V. M. Molotov, really, is not able to participate in the Con-ference. I and Mr. Molotov regret it extremely, but the convening, on requestof the Deputies of the Supreme Soviet, in April, of a sessions of the SupremeSoviet of the U.S.S.R., where the presence of Mr. Molotov is absolutely necessary, is excluding the possibility of his participation even in the firstmeetings of the Conference.You also know that Ambassador Gromyko has quite successfully accom-plished his task at Dumbarton Oaks, and we are confident that he will withgreat success head the Soviet delegation in San Francisco.As regards various interpretations, you understand, this cannot deter-mine the decisions which are to be made.&quot;ANNEX IV.To Prime Minister from President Roosevelt. No. 729.   29.3.45.(Personal and Top Secret.)Your 925 and 926.I have likewise been watching with anxiety and concern the development of soviet attitude since the Crimea Conference. I am acutely aware of the dangersinherent in the present course of events not only for the immediate issues involved and our decisions at the Crimea but also for the San Francisco Conferenceand future world co-operation. Our peoples and indeed those of the whole world are watching with anxious hope the extent to which the decisions we reached at the Crimea are being honestly carried forward. For our part (and i know for yours) we intend to shirk no responsibility which we have assumed under those decisions. I agree with you that we should not neglect any step calculated to demonstrate to the Soviet Government the vital importance of their doinglikewise.   It is for this reason and because of the magnitude of the issues[29564] b 2
involved that I consider it essential to base ourselves squarely on the Crimeadecisions themselves and not allow any other considerations, no matter how important, to cloud the issue at this time. I have this particularly in mind withrespect to the Polish negotiations.You will recall that the Agreement on Poland at Yalta was a compromise between the Soviet position that the Lublin Government should merely be&apos;&apos; enlarged &apos;&apos; and our contention that we should start with a clean slate and assist in the formation of an entirely new Polish Government. The wording of the resulting Agreement reflects this compromise, but if we attempt to evade thefact that we placed, as clearly shown in the Agreement, somewhat more emphasis on the Lublin Poles than on the other two groups from which the new Governmentis to be drawn, I feel we will expose ourselves to the charge that we are attempting to go back on the Crimean decision. It by no means follows, however, and onthis we must be adamant, that because of this advantage the Lublin group canin any way arrogate to itself the right to determine what Poles from the other two groups are to be brought in for consultation. For the foregoing reasons i feel strongly that we should first of all bring the matter to a head on the question that falls clearly within the Yalta Agreement, namely, our right to call for con-sultation a group of Polish leaders that are truly representative and that it isfor the Commission, and the Commission alone, to decide which Poles arerepresentative. Our Ambassadors in Moscow appear to be in agreement that weshould proceed on the basis of their redraft, designed to reconcile our basicinstructions with the points put forward by Molotov. They will at the same timemake it absolutely clear that we have not receded in the slightest from the other points in our instructions of 19th March and shall revert to them at a later stage.I do feel the other questions of procedure and the proper time for reopeningthe other points can be safely left to our Ambassadors. They know exactly what we think and feel on the entire question and I am personally completely confident that under no circumstances will they take any step or agree to anything whichwould impair the objectives we both seek. For example, I believe that if we can get Soviet agreement to the principle that the Commission and the Commissionalone shall determine what Poles shall be invited for consultation and a definitelist is drawn up and invitations issued, then consultation with the Lublin Polesfirst might even afford certain advantages. They could be told how we interpret the Yalta decision and thus avoid the danger of having the question of interpre-tation become a matter of dispute between the Polish groups themselves. I feel,subject to your approval, that our Ambassadors should proceed along this line to bring our differences with Molotov into sharp focus without waiting for us to concert our messages to Stalin. Averell is ready to go. ahead on this basis if wecan obtain your concurrence, which I earnestly hope you will give.I agree with you, however, that the time has come to take up directly withStalin the broader aspects of the Soviet attitude (with particular reference to poland) and my immediate following telegram will contain the text of the messageI propose to send.I hope you will let me have your reaction as soon as possible.ANNEX V.To Prime Minister from President Roosevelt. No. 730.  29.3.45.(Personal and Top Secret.)Following is my suggested message to Stalin :  &quot; I cannot conceal from you the concern with which I view the developmentof events of mutual interest since our fruitful meeting at Yalta. The decisionswe reached there were good ones and have for the most part been welcomed with enthusiasm by the peoples of the world who saw in your ability to find a commonbasis of understanding the best pledge for a secure and peaceful world after this war. Precisely because of the hopes and expectations that these decisions raisedtheir fulfilment is being followed with the closest attention. We have no rightto let them be disappointed. So far there has been a discouraging lack of progress made in the carrying out, which the world expects, of the political decisions which we reached at &quot;the Conference, particularly those relating to the polish question. I am frankly puzzled as to why this should be and must tell you that I do not fully understand in many respects the apparent indifferent attitudeof your Government.   Having understood each other so well at Yalta I am
convinced that the three of us can and will clear away any obstacles which have developed since then. I intend, therefore, in this message to lay before you with complete frankness the problem as I see it.&quot; Although I have in mind primarily the difficulties which the Polishnegotiations have encountered, I must make a brief mention of our agreementembodied in the declaration on Liberated Europe. I frankly cannot understand why the recent developments in Rumania should be regarded as not falling within the terms of that agreement. I hope you will find time personally toexamine the correspondence between our Governments on this subject.&apos;&apos; However, the part of our agreement at Yalta which has aroused the greatestpopular interest and is the most urgent relates to the Polish question. You are aware of course that the Commission which we set up has made no progress.I feel this is due to the interpretation which your Government is placing uponthe Crimean decisions. In order that there shall be no misunderstanding I setforth below my interpretation of the points of the agreement which are pertinentto the difficulties encountered by the Commission in Moscow.&quot;In the discussions that have taken place so far your Government appearsto take the position that the new Polish Provisional Government of national unity which we agreed should be formed should be little more than a continuation of the present Warsaw Government. I cannot reconcile this either with our agreement or our discussions. While it is true that the Lublin Government isto be reorganised and its members play a prominent role it is to be clone in sucha fashion as to bring into being a new Government. This point is clearly brought out in several places in the text of the agreement. I must make it quite plain toyou that any such solution which would result in a thinly disguised continuanceof the present Warsaw regime would be unacceptable and would cause the people,of the United States to regard the Yalta Agreement as having failed. It isequally apparent that for the same reason the Warsaw Government cannot underthe agreement claim the right to select or reject what Poles are to be brought to moscow by the Commission for consultation. Can we not agree that it is upto the Commission to select the Polish leaders to come to Moscow to consult inthe first instance and invitations be sent out accordingly. If this could be doneI see no great objection to having the Lublin group come first in order that theymay be fully acquainted with the agreed interpretation of the Yalta decisions on this point. In order to facilitate the agreement the Commission might first of all select a small but representative group of Polish leaders who could suggestother names for the consideration of the Commission. We have not and wouldnot bar or veto any candidate for consultation which Mr. Molotov might proposebeing confident that he would not suggest any Poles Avho would be inimical to theintent of the Crimean decision. I feel that it is not too much to ask that myAmbassador be accorded the same confidence. It is obvious to me that if the rightof the Commission to select these Poles is limited or shared with the WarsawGovernment the very foundation on which our agreement rests would be destroyed.While the foregoing are the immediate obstacles which in my opinion have prevented the Commission from making any progress in this vital matter thereare two other suggestions which were not in the agreement but nevertheless havea very important bearing on the result we all seek. Neither of these suggestionshas been as yet accepted by your Government.  I refer to (1) That there should be the maximum of political tranquillity in Poland andthat dissident groups should cease any measures and countermeasuresagainst each other. That we should respectively use our influence tothat end seems to me so eminently reasonable.(2) It would also seem entirely natural in view of the responsibilities placed upon them by the agreement that representatives of the American andBritish members of the Commission should be permited to visit Poland.I wish I could convey to you how important it is for the successfuldevelopment of our program of international collaboration that thisPolish question be settled fairly and speedily. If this is not done all of the difficulties and dangers to Allied unity which we had so muchin mind in reaching our decision at the Crimea will face us in an even more acute form. You are, I am sure, aware that genuinepopular support in the United States is required to carry out any government policy, foreign or domestic. The American people make up their own mind and no Government action can change it. Imention this fact because the last sentence of your message about Mr. Molotov&apos;s attendance at San Francisco made me wonder whether you give full weight to this factor.&quot;

ANNEX VI.Prime Minister to President Roosevelt. No. 928.   30.3.45.(Personal and Top Secret.)1. Thank you for your 729 and 730. I am glad you agree that the time hascome for us both to address Stalin directly. We consider the draft in your 730is a grave and weighty document and, although there are a few points in which itdoes not give full expression to our own views, we will wholeheartedly accept it,and I will also endorse it in my parallel message to Stalin, the text of which I ^will send you before it goes.2. Perhaps, however, before deciding on your final text you would considerthe importance of making it clear that we shall not enter into any arrangements with the Lublinites before the arrival of our own Poles. There is no harm in discussing with the Lublinites, but I am sure that Mikolajczyk, for instance, willstipulate that the field shall be open when he arrives. We should be glad if you would provide for this in your draft.   .3. More important still is to get rid of Molotov&apos;s veto on our candidates.You indicate this in a most polite manner, but would it not be well to emphasise the point by adding a sentence at the appropriate place to the effect that none ofthe three of us should veto each other&apos;s candidates? Otherwise, he will simplyveto every one that the Lublin Poles wish him to.4.   Finally, could you not mention in the last paragraph of your draft thatit was Molotov himself who originally made the suggestion of observers ?5. I do not ask you to delay the dispatch of your draft on account of thesedesired additions by us. We leave it in your hands. Meanwhile, I agree that our two Ambassadors should give Molotov the redraft of the latter&apos;s basic principles,making it clear in doing so that we have not receded in the slightest from the other points in our instructions of 19th March and will revert to them at a later stage.ANNEX VII.Prime Minister to President Roosevelt. No. 929.   31.3.45.(Personal and Secret.)Following is text of message I propose to send to Stalin. Please let me know what you think.  I will not send it off till I hear from you :  Text begins: Prime Minister to Marshal Stalin.(Personal and Top Secret.)1. You will by now, I hope, have received the message from the Presidentof the United States which he was good enough to show to me before he sent it.It is now my duty on behalf of Flis Majesty&apos;s Government to assure you that theWar Cabinet desire me to express to you our wholehearted endorsement of this message of the Presidents, and that we associate ourselves with it in its entirety.2. There are two or three points which I desire specially to emphasise.First, that we do not consider we have retained in the Moscow discussions thespirit of Yalta nor, indeed, at points, the letter. It was never imagined by us that the Commission we all three appointed with so much goodwill would nothave been able to carry out their part swiftly and easily in a mood of give and take. We certainly thought that a Polish Government &quot;new&quot; and&quot;reorganised&quot; would by now have been in existence, recognised by all theUnited Nations. This would have afforded a proof to the world of our capacity and resolve to work together for its future.   It is still not too late to achieve this.3. However, even before forming such a new and reorganised PolishGovernment, it was agreed by the Commission tha,t representative Poles shouldbe summoned from inside Poland and from Poles abroad, not necessarily to take part in the Government but merely for free and frank consultation. Even thispreliminary step cannot be taken because of the claim put forward to veto anyinvitation, even to the consultation, of which the Soviet or the Lublin government do not approve. We can never agree to such a veto by any one of us three. Thisveto reaches its supreme example in the case of M. Mikalojczyk, who is regardedthroughout the British and American world as the outstanding Polish figureoutside Poland.


T. 377/5.PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT TO PRIME MINISTER. No. 732.PERSONAL AND TOP SECRET, 1 April, 1945Thank you for your 928 of March 30 in regard toray proposed message to Stalin.     I am very pleased to find that we are in such substantial agreement.I have carefully considered the helpful suggestions that you have made and I am making the following threeadditions to cover the points you raise.In regard to the point raised in your paragraph 2I am adding immediately after the words &quot;Yaltadecisions on this point&quot; the following sentence:;;It is of course understood that if the Lublin groupcomes first no arrangements would be made Independentlywith them before the arrival of the other Polishleaders called for consultation/&apos;&apos;In your paragraph 3 after the words ;; accordedthe same confidence&quot;, I am adding the phrase &apos; andthat any candidate for consultation presented by anyone of the Commission be accepted by the others in good faith&quot;.In regard to your point 4 after the words&quot;permitted to visit Poland&apos;&apos;, I would add the following sentence-:   &quot;As you will recall Mr. Molotov himselfsuggested this at an early meeting of the Commissionand only subsequently withdrew it&quot;&apos;.I have just received your 929, and as I concur in your proposed message I have sent mine to Stalinwith the foregoing additions.DISTRIBUTIONFORINFORMATThe KingForeign secretary sir E.

4. We also have learned with surprise and regret that M. Molotov&apos;sspontaneous offer to allow observers or Missions to enter Poland has now been withdrawn. We are therefore deprived of ail means of checking for ourselves theinformation, often of a most painful character, which is sent us almost daily bythe Polish Government in London. We do not understand why a veil of secrecyshould thus be drawn over the Polish scene. We offer the fullest facilities to theSoviet Government to send Missions or individuals to visit any of the territories in our military occupation. In several cases this offer has been accepted by the soviets and visits have taken place to mutual satisfaction. We ask that theprinciple of reciprocity shall be observed in these matters, which would help tomake so good a foundation for our enduring partnership.5. The President has also shown me the messages which have passed between him and you about M. Molotov&apos;s inability to be present at the Conference at san Francisco. We had hoped the presence there of the three Foreign. ministers might have led to a clearance of many of the difficulties which have descendedupon us in a storm since our happy and hopeful union at Yalta. We do not however question in any way the weight of the public reasons which make itnecessary for him to remain in Russia.6. Like the President, I too was struck with the concluding sentence ofyour message to him. What he says about the American people also applies tothe British people and to the nations of the British Commonwealth with theaddition that His Majesty&apos;s present advisers only hold office at the will of auniversal suffrage Parliament. If our efforts to reach an agreement about Polandare to be doomed to failure, I shall be bound to confess the fact to Parliamentwhen they return from the Easter Recess. No one has pleaded the cause of Russiawith more fervour and conviction than I have tried to do. I was the first toraise my voice on 22ncl June, 1941. It is more than a year since I proclaimedto a startled world the justice of the Curzon Line for Russia&apos;s Western frontier,and this frontier has now been accepted by both the British Parliament and thePresident of the United States. It is as a sincere friend of Russia that I makemy personal appeal to you and to your colleagues to come to a good understandingabout Poland with the Western Democracies and not to smite down the handsof comradeship in the future guidance of the world wmich we now extend.
