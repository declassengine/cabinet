THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 211.31st March, 1945.WAR CABINET.CONTROL OF EMPLOYMENT (CIVIL SERVANTS)  ORDER.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.AT their meeting on the 16th March (L.P. (45) 15th Meeting) the Lord-Presidents Committee approved in principle the proposals contained in my memorandum (L.P. (45) 60) for the application to the whole non-industrial CivilService of a Control of Employment Order; and invited me to submit them forthe approval of the War Cabinet. I accordingly invite my colleagues to agree in principle to those proposals.2. The effect would be that no civil servant would be free to leave his orher employment without the consent of the employing Department, subject to appeal to one of the tribunals set up by the Minister of Labour and NationalService. The general principles governing re-allocation of man-power betweencivilian employments which were set out in Cmd. 6568 would then apply toGovernment employment as to civilian employment elsewhere.3. In my memorandum to the Lord Presidents Committee I set out someof the reasons which in my view render such an Order imperative at the presenttime. Briefly they were : (a) the increasing shortage of man-power in the CivilService, especially in the London area; (b) the danger, especially to Departmentsemploying a high proportion of temporary staff, of an exodus of staff at thisphase of the war; (c) the impossibility of controlling such an exodus by thepowers of the Minister of Labour and National Service under Defence Regula-tion 58a, which was designed primarily for the direction of individuals to perform certain work; and (d) the unfairness to men and women in the Forces,and in other forms of war service, if they are to be tied to their employment whiletemporary civil servants are able to resign and establish themselves in outsideemployment in advance of their less fortunate contemporaries.4. I need not enlarge on these considerations, which are within theexperience of all Departments. I might add that the attention of the national staff Side has now been drawn to the fact that some. Departments are holdingtheir temporary staff by leading them to suppose that they are not free to leavewithout permission; and the Staff Side have asked that the true position shouldbe explained to all temporary civil servants-that is, that under the law as it stands they are free to leave their employment unless individually directed bythe Minister of Labour and National Service. I think that Departments would find this very embarrassing which underlines once again the inadequacy of themachinery of individual directions to meet a pix)blem which is primarily one of controlling the movement of the general body of civil servants.5. A year ago a draft Order was discussed and agreed with the Staff Side;as a result of these discussions, the restrictions on the power of employingDepartments to discharge staff, which are, as in all Essential Work Orders^ thecounterpoise to the restrictions on the freedom of employees to leave their employment, were embodied in an agreed document. That document will requireamendment because the current proposal is that the restraint shall apply to thewhole non-industrial Civil Service and not, as was previously contemplated,merely to such Departments as ask for it to be applied. This change will meetthe objection raised in the earlier proposal by certain Ministers, that any such scheme ought to be applied in the Civil Service to &quot;all or none.&quot; If mycolleagues approve my proposals in principle, I would suggest-that approach should forthwith be made by the Official Side of the National Whitley Councilto the Staff Side, informing them of the Cabinet decision, and inviting them todiscuss the necessary amendments on the basis that the Order will have to be[29565]Copy No.
put into effect by a specified date. Alternatively, if the Staff Side prefernot to be implicated before the Order comes into force as may now bethe case, in spite of the fact that previously they agreed to its application the Order could be put into effect forthwith, and subsequent discussioninvited about the obligations to be undertaken by Departments. In my view it is essential that, if &quot; freezing&quot; is to be applied to the Service as a whole,it should be applied at the earliest possible date, since any substantial delaybetween the announcement of the decision, and its coming into effect, might precipitate a flood of those resignations which it is the object of a &quot; freezing &quot;Order to control. Accordingly, while it is intended that the fullest hearing shallbe given to the views of the staff, I think that discussion can only safely be carriedon within the framework of an Order either made or shortly to be made.6. The proposal to apply a &quot;freezing&quot; Order to the Civil Service as awhole has the effect of cutting out the power, which Departmental Staff Sideswould have enjoyed under the previous scheme, of making representations tothe Minister of Labour, before a Department was designated under the Order,concerning the terms and conditions of service in the Department, and the pro-visions existing in the Department for the welfare of the civil servants employedthere. As all Departments alike will be affected by the present Order, it is not practicable to include in it any corresponding provision, and I do not thinkthat any is necessary. The ordinary Whitley machinery will, of course, continueto be available for the discussion of these topics. As regards the general con-ditions of service and welfare in the non-industrial Civil Service as a whole,the Minister of Labour and National Service has, I think, satisfied himself thatthese are not in any way inferior to those which he would expect to find in outsideemployment before agreeing to bring it under control.7. It is not intended that the new Order shall apply to civil servants whohave reached the normal age of retirement (ordinarily 60); and, as I have indicated,, the provisions of Cmd. 6568 regarding the release of persons in&quot; Class K&quot; from controlled employment immediately the war in Europe endswill apply also to the controlled Civil Service. A more debatable point is whetherestablished civil servants should be covered by the &quot;freezing&quot; arrangements.They were not included in the earlier draft Order, and I should be content to omit them from this one. seeing that the prospective loss of superannuation rightsis in practice a sufficient deterrent to irresponsible resignation : but if mycolleagues prefer to have them brought in for the sake of completeness I do not wish to dissent.   It would certainly simplify the Order.8. I am advised that, before action can be taken, a new Defence Regulationwill be required. If the present proposals are approved in principle, theLegislation Committee will be asked to approve the necessary addition to theDefence Regulations. If the National Staff Side indicate preference for theOrder being made before discussions are initiated, or if during discussions itappears that resignations of temporary civil servants are increasing, the Orderwill have to be made while the Defence Regulation is lying before both Houses.9.   The Minister of Labour and National Service has seen this Paper andhas concurred in my proposals.10.   To sum up (1) I seek the approval of the War Cabinet to the application to the wholenon-inclustriai Civil Service of a Control of Employment Order. Thiswill mean that no civil servant could leave his or her employment without the consent of the employing Department subject to appealto one of the Tribunals set up by the Ministry of Labour and NationalService.(2) The Staff Side of the National Whitley Council will be told of thisdecision and given an opportunity to discuss amendments to the previously agreed document. But the making of the Order cannotbe delayed on account of these discussions.(3) The Order will not apply to civil servants who have reached the normalage of retirement (ordinarily 60). It is for consideration whetherthe Order should apply to established civil servants who would, ofcourse, lose their superannuation rights if they resigned.J. A.Treasury Chambers,31st March, 1945.
