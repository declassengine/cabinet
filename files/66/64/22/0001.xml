Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET. I   Copy No.W.P. (45) 222. \j6th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.THE LEGAL BASIS OF ECONOMIC CONTROL IN THE transition period.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.THE end of hostilities in Europe will not terminate the need for economic controls. Powers of control will continue to be required at any rate throughoutStage II and even for some time after the end of the Japanese war. It is, there-fore, the declared policy of the Government that the broad framework of theeconomic controls should be maintained after the end of the war with Germany,but that within that framework the rigidity of particular controls should be modified as the public interest requires. The statement which was made by thePrime Minister in the House of Commons on the 16th November, 1944, is repro-duced in the Appendix to the Memorandum.2. These controls are based, however, on Regulations made under the Emer-gency Powers (Defence) Acts. They were introduced for the purpose of mobilisingthe nation&apos;s economic resources for war; and many of the legislative instrumentson which they rest are expressly related to defence needs. The Law Officers have advised that the emergency contemplated by those Acts covers not only the periodof hostilities but, within limits, &quot; the dislocation which the conduct of hostilitieshad caused in the national life.&quot; After the end of the war in Europe, however,the economic controls will be used to an increasing extent not for the purposesof the war against Japan, but for such purposes as the prevention of inflation and the allocation of priorities as between export trade and urgent home needs for houses, clothing, furniture, &amp;c.; and it seems to me somewhat doubtfulwhether the Courts can be expected to hold that controls exercised for these purposes are intra vires of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts. In any case,these were not the purposes which Parliament had in mind in 1939 when con-ferring these powers on the Government, and their use for such purposes willbe liable to challenge in Parliament if not in the Courts.On the last two occasions Parliament has shown an increasing reluctance togrant the annual renewal of the Emergency (Defence) Acts and we shall haveeven greater difficulty in obtaining their renewal in July of this year, especially if by then the war in Europe had ended. The Parliamentary situation wouldbe much easier if we could separate the defence powers required for the war against Japan from the powers of economic control which are not directly related to the Japanese war and not necessarily co-terminous with it.3. It was clear from the debate on the 14th July, 1944, on the last renewal of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts, that the House of Commons was onlywilling to renew the Acts for a further year on the understanding that, beforethe question of further renewal arose in 1945, Paliament would be given a full opportunity of reviewing the situation as a whole and considering, in particular,the use of economic controls for the purposes of the transition period. In replyto that debate I said that, while there could be no question of fettering theGovernment&apos;s powers in such a way as would interfere with the effective prosecu-tion of the war against Japan, it was a fair point for argument-whether thereshould be fresh legislation for the continuance of the economic controls. Andit is my view that the Government would be well advised, before the emergency powers (Defence) Acts fall due for renewal (before the 23rd August, which means[29609] b
in practice a debate during July), to introduce fresh legislation for the purposeof obtaining an express mandate from Parliament authorising them to use theseeconomic controls for the purpose of dealing with the economic problems whichmay arise after the end of the war in Europe.4. A Bill for this purpose has been prepared under the direction of theReconstruction Committee, after consultation with the Departments primarily responsible for the economic controls. A copy of this Bill is attached. It would,be a temporary measure with a limited period of operation. It would provide that Defence Regulations which relate to the control or regulation of supplies and services may be converted by Order-in-Council to cover the purposes of the transition period, whether or not they are for the time being necessary or expedient for the war-time purpose for which they were made. Orders-in-council made for this purpose would be subject to a negative resolution. And everyOrder made under a Defence Regulation so converted would also be subjectto a negative resolution.5.   Fresh legislation on these lines would have the following advantages :  (a) Express Parliamentary authority would be secured for the use of economic controls for purposes other than purely war purposes.(b) Parliament would secure a greater measure of control over the use ofthese powers, as subordinate orders made under the Regulations wouldbe subject to negative resolution.(c) Provision would have been made to enable the powers of economic control to be exercised, so far as may prove to be necessary, after the date when the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts cease to operate.8. The detailed provisions of this Bill can be considered in clue course bythe Legislation Committee. The questions which I submit to the War cabinet at this stage are whether such legislation should be introduced and, if so, what isthe most suitable time for its introduction.My-fnain reasons for favouring legislation on these lines have been indicatedin paragraph 2 and 3 above. Without a fresh mandate from Parliament on theuse of economic controls after the end of the war in Europe, I foresee greatdifficulty in carrying out the policy outlined in the Prime Ministers statementof the 16th November last. If particular controls are open to challenge on theground that they are no longer required for war-time purposes, I see no prospectof our being able to use these powers of control for the purpose of maintainingeconomic stability during the transition from war to peace. We cannot hope tofollow a policy of orderly and progressive relaxation if the whole basis of control is open to constant challenge in Parliament. And, as is indicated by experienceafter the last war, such difficulties in Parliament might be reflected in areluctance on the part of the courts, particularly the summary courts, to imposeadequate penalties for contravention of controls which were being so challenged.7. If my colleagues agree that such legislation is desirable, there remains the question of timing. This is a Bill, I suggest, which ought to be presented to Parliament by a Government representing all the main political parties. it ought to be passed before the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts fall due forrenewal in July. It ought to be in operation soon after the end of hostilities in Europe. All these considerations point to the desirability of introducing theBill in the near future.I submit, therefore, that the War Cabinet should decide that the Bill beintroduced as soon as agreement on its detailed provisions has been reached bythe Legislation Committee and the Cabinet.8. The Minister of Reconstruction, whom I have consulted, agrees with me that it is appropriate for the questions of policy raised in this memorandum to be brought directly to the War Cabinet, and concurs in the proposals madein it.H. M.Home Office, S.W. 1, Qth April, 1945.
APPENDIX.Statement by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons,16th November, 1944.It is not possible to look beyond the end of the Japanese war, and my replyrelates to the period between the defeat of Germany and the defeat of Japan.Until Japan has been defeated the war must have first call on our efforts. Afterthe defeat of Germany it will be possible and necessary to turn over an increasingpart of our resources to civilian production. Thus we must make exertionsto restore our export trade and to re-equip our industry. The shortage ofhouses, both permanent and emergency, must be grappled with as if it were awar-time measure. Active steps must be taken to relieve the shortage of civiliangoods.As stated in the White Paper to be published to-day, the existing system of allocating man-power to the Forces and to the various industries will be main-tained. Nevertheless, it is intended to mitigate so far as possible the rigidityof the existing controls over labour. Many of the war-time controls over rawmaterials, industrial capacity, agriculture, food, transport and so forth willlikewise be as necessary in this period as they are to-day. In these fields also,relaxations will be possible and will be made whenever circumstances permitand in an orderly manner. Any other course would, result in violent disturbanceswhich might well lead to inflation; would be harmful to the economic life of thecountry; and would make it impossible to ensure that the Nation&apos;s resources are devoted to essential needs, and are fairly distributed during periods inwhich demand will still be without any economic relation to supply.It is too early to forecast the stages by which control will be relaxed. Butthe House can rest assured that the whole matter will be dealt with in a severelypractical manner, each case being considered not only on its merits but as part ofan organised scheme. It is important in this phase that theoretical, ideologicalor partisan tendencies either way should be excluded, and the governing considera-tion in every case should be the public interest.Official Report, Cols. 2112-3.29609 I
