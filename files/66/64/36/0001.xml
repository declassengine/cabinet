DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;B GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.secret.p. (45) 236.Wth April, 1945.WAR CABINET.THE FUTURE OF TANGIER.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I submit for the consideration of my colleagues a memorandum concerningthe future of the Tangier Zone of Morocco. This question calls for an urgentdecision in order that the necessary preparations may be made to put an end tothe present Spanish occupation of the Zone and to introduce the new regimethere as soon as the war in Europe is over.If my colleagues approve the proposals set out in the memorandum, I would propose immediately to institute discussions with the United States Governmentwith a view to reaching agreement with them on a common policy. The UnitedStates Government are already aware that we have the Tangier question underconsideration and have more than once in recent months enquired as to our views and expressed the wish to hold discussions with us. They are anxious to bringthe French Provisional Government into the discussions, and I would proposethat, once broad agreement has been reached between us and the United StatesGovernment, we should agree to do so.In discussing the matter with the United States Government we may find that the latter suggest that in connexion with the future of Tangier we should consider the possibility of making some arrangements for the future security ofthe area of the Straits of Gibraltar and the Western Mediterranean. They are known to have had under consideration a scheme put forward by the UnitedStates Consul-General in Tangier whereby a Western Mediterranean Commission,on which the United States, the United Kingdom, the U.S.S.R., France and Spainwould be represented, would be set up to assume the responsibility for preserving the security of the Straits and the Western Mediterranean. Under this plan the duty of supervising the future regime at Tangier would be entrusted to theCommission.Any proposal for the setting up of such a Commission raises very wideissues, and it seems premature to discuss it at this moment or until the futureof the proposed World Security Organisation, with which any such commission would presumably have to be connected, is better defined. Nor is this idea of a western Mediterranean Commission relevant to the immediate problems ofTangier i.e., the removal of the Spaniards and the restoration, with slightamendments, of the 1923 regime. When the time eventually comes to negotiate a new permanent Tangier Statute it may be desirable to consider linking this up with some international arrangement for the security of the Straits and theWestern Mediterranean, It seems, however, premature to discuss this questionnow, and should the United States Government raise the matter I would proposeto try to persuade them to concentrate on the more immediate problems of Tangierand to leave the future security organisation for the Western mediterranean to be considered in the light of the outcome of the San Francisco Conference,in taking this line with the United States authorities, it will be important notto give the impression that we are opposed to the United States being associatedwith any international arrangements that may subsequently be established to watch over the security of the Straits. On the contrary, if any such arrange-nvents are eventually made we should welcome the participation of the UnitedStates.12745    [29667]
It will be seen that in the attached memorandum I have recommended thatthe Soviet Government should not be invited to participate in the futureregime for the administration of the Tangier Zone for the reason that the soviet union has never had any direct interest in the area. I would propose, however,to inform them at the appropriate moment of what we have in mind. This willenable the Soviet Government to make any observations which they wish. ButI do not in any circumstances contemplate that they should participate in theadministration of Tangier.A. E.Foreign Office, 11th April, 1945.Memoranda m.THE FUTURE OF TANGIER.I.-B ackgro und.THE history of the creation of the Tangier Zone of Morocco is long andcomplicated, but it is necessary, for the purposes of this memorandum, to set it out in some detail.In the 18th and 19th centuries Morocco was an independent State,predominantly Arab and Moslem, under the rule of the Sultan of Morocco andFez, who. concluded treaties of peace and friendship with a number of ChristianPowers, e.g., the treaties with Great Britain of 1856.* Between the years 1880and 1904 the Sultan &quot;s power grew weaker and Morocco came more and morewithin the orbit of the European Powers and subject to their rivalry. France,pursuing the policy originally welcomed by Bismarck of obtaining a colonial empire to console her for the loss of the Franco-Prussian War, and foiled in herambitions in East Africa after Fashoda (1898), turned her attention with greaterconcentration to Morocco. In 1904 Great Britain concluded with France theEntente Cordiale Agreement, which, together with a Franco-Spanish agreementsigned in the same year, virtually recognised France&apos;s special position in Moroccoand Spain&apos;s right to a sphere of influence on the North Moroccan coast, andforeshadowed the creation of the International Zone of Tangier. Then followed the two Moroccan crises provoked by Germany. From the first crisis (broughtabout by the Kaiser&apos;s visit to Tangier in 1905) resulted the calling of theConference of Algeciras in 1906, which, in an endeavour to &quot; internationalise &quot;the Moroccan question, drew up the Act of Algeciras. The second crisis (causedby the despatch of a German gunboat to Agaclir in 1911) led to the signing ofthe Franco-German Convention of 1911, which, confirming and expanding aFranco-German declaration of 1909, placed on record Germany&apos;s acceptance ofFrance&apos;s special position in Morocco.The conclusion of this convention with Germany left France free to enterinto negotiations with the Sultan for the conclusion of the Franco-MoroccanTreaty of 1912, which established a French protectorate over the whole ofMorocco. France then concluded, in the same year, a treaty with Spain wherebyshe &quot; leased &quot; to Spain that area on the northern coast which she had alreadyrecognised in 1904 as a Spanish sphere of influence. The Franco-Spanish Treatyalso defined the Tangier Zone (which is geographically surrounded by the SpanishZone) and provided expressly for the establishment of an international regimethere. Thus both the Spanish Government in the Spanish Zone and the future international regime at Tangier were to hold their position, not direct from the sultan, but from the French Government, in virtue of the latter&apos;s right of protection of the whole of the Sultan&apos;s dominions. This is still in theory the positionto-day.Whereas the French and Spanish Governments have always aimed individu-ally at controlling Tangier themselves. British policy, guided purely by strategic considerations, has always aimed at internationalisation. The creation of aninternational regime at Tangier was delayed owing to the war of 1914-18, but was eventually completed by the Convention of 1923.   The Zone was permanently* These treaties are still fully in force as regards the Spanish Zone of Morocco, whereHis Majesty&apos;s Government still have capitulatory rights, but have been greatly modified in their application to the Tangier Zone by the Convention of 1923 and in their application to the french zone by the Convention of 1937.
internationalised and de-militarised, legislative power was vested m an Inter-national Assembly containing 4 French, 4 Spanish, 3 British, 1 Belgian 1 dutch and 1 Portuguese and (since 1928) 3 Italian representatives nominated by theirrespective Consulates, and 6 Moors and 3 Moroccan Jews nominated by the sultan&apos;s representative, the Mendoub. The Committee of Control, consistingof the official representatives of the United Kingdom, France, Spam, the Aether-lands, Belgium, Portugal, and (since 1928) Italy, exercised the right of vetoover the decisions of the Assembly. The actual administration was entrusted to an administrator (at first French, then in August 1940, Spanish) with aBritish, a Spanish and an Italian assistant. The Mendoub was nominally incharge of the administration of native affairs, but, in fact, he was a mere puppetin the hands of a French colonial officer, Colonel Truchet, appointed by theFrench Government as his &quot; adviser.&quot; The United States of America, thoughparties to the Act of Algeciras, never became parties to any of these special arrangements concerning Tangier or the other Zones of Morocco, and their position has therefore continued to be based on their original capitulatory rights in Morocco. The United States of America took no part in the Tangier admims-tration.The International regime in Tangier was inaugurated in 1925 and func-tioned until the Spanish occupation in 1940. As was only to be expected it wasnot an ideal administration owing to the rivalry of the various national groups.Inevitably, owing to their interests, the French and the Spanish were the mostconspicuous elements in the administration, each striving to secure advantagesover the other, while Great Britain tried uneasily to hold the balance.Although there were abuses, it can be said that on the whole the regimefunctioned reasonably well until the collapse of France in June 1940. Imme-diately afterwards, the Spanish Government sent troops to occupy the TangierZone (ostensibly to maintain the neutrality of the Zone which, it was claimed,might be effected by the collapse of France and the entry of Italy into the war).In November 1940 Spain took over altogether the administration of the Zone.Since we were at the time in no position to oppose this violation of an inter-national agreement, we had no alternative but to acquiesce in the fait accompli.We were able, however, to negotiate an agreement with the Spanish government at the turn of the year, which safeguarded the special personal rights of Britishsubjects in Tangier and guaranteed the continued functioning of the british press and of British institutions, e.g., the British Post Office. In return.His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted the de facto Spanish occupation of Tangierand recognised Spain&apos;s &quot;special interest&quot; in the Zone. It was made clear,however, that this arrangement was only provisional and was without prejudice to the rights of His Majesty&apos;s Government or to third parties to the relevantinternational instruments. This modus vivendi also included a Spanish assurance that there would be no fortifications of the Zone.At the time of the Allied landings in North Africa on the 8th November.1942, we gave the Spanish Government an assurance that &quot;these operations would not compromise the existing modus vivendi in Tangier in any way.&quot; in response to a Spanish request, we informed the Spanish Ambassador in writingon the 16th December, 1942, that the assurances of the 8th November &quot; represented the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards Spain not only for the period of operations now (i.e., then) in progress in North Africa, but for the duration of thewar.&quot;II. Proposals for the Future of Tangier.With the end of the war in Europe approaching, it is necessarv to consider urgently what form the future regime in the Zone should take, and what steps should be taken to establish the new regime and put an end to the present illegalSpanish occupation.The Chiefs of Staff have stated that from the military point of view the typeof future regime in Tangier is not of over-riding importance provided that-(a) its establishment does not arouse Spanish hostility.(b) radar installations and airfields are available in the Zone for theprotection of the security of the Straits., . Careful consideration has confirmed me in the view that an internationalregime should be restored in Tangier.   Every attempt should be made, however,to eliminate from the new regime the defects of the old.   The new regime should[29667] % 2
be more truly international and there should be truer equality of status amongthe Powers concerned. At the same time no attempt should be made to relegateFrance and Spain to secondary roles. The close historical associations of both countries with Tangier, as well as their geographical situation, give them a strongclaim to at least an equal share with any Powers in the administration of the zone. Secondly, in accordance with the wishes of the Chiefs of Staff, we must ensure that under the new regime the Zone should not be demilitarised, but thatthe requisite facilities (radar and airfield facilities) should be available for theprotection of the Straits area.Subject to these changes, I would recommend that the new regime should,generally speaking, follow the main lines of the 1923 Convention, i.e., an adminis-tration and an administrative staff, appointed by agreement with the powers concerned, a committee of control consisting of the diplomatic (or consular)representatives of the Tangier Powers and also possibly a legislative assembly.If, however, a legislative assembly is to be retained, it will be necessary to ensurethat it functions in a more satisfactory manner than in the past, and to this endit may be desirable that its powers should be reduced or at least more strictlydefined and controlled.When, following the conclusion of hostilities in Europe, the Spanish Guvexm-ment are requested to withdraw the troops which they illegally sent to occupy the Zone in 1940, the former international regime, subject to any amendments to which general agreement can be obtained, will, of course, be automaticallyrestored, and will remain in force until agreement can be reached among thePowers concerned upon a new and permanent regime.As regards the steps to be taken to put an end to the present illegal position,the Chiefs of Staff are against any proposal for forcible reoccupation on twogrounds :  (a) it will offend and may alienate permanently the Spanish people and istherefore contrary to our strategic interests, and(b) sufficient forces are not likely to be available except at the expense ofmore important commitments elsewhere.The Chiefs of Staff consider that reoccupation should be carried out withthe agreement of Spain and that it would be most desirable to secure the active co-operation of the United States and France therein.I am in agreement with these views. Although the behaviour of the SpanishGovernment in 1940 was completely unjustifiable and there may well be a populardemand for action to compel their withdrawal in circumstances damaging to spanish prestige, such action would be calculated to cause lasting resentment in spain and to prejudice the conclusion of satisfactory arrangements for the futuresecurity of the Straits area. Looking beyond our relations with the presentSpanish Government, our long term political and strategic interests require a friendly Spain and it is consequently desirable that provocative action shouldbe avoided. It will therefore be necessary to arrange if possible for a peacefultransition to a new international regime by means of prior negotiation.In order to ensure a peaceful transition without clanger of civil disturbances,a temporary military occupation of the Zone will almost certainly be necessary.It had originally been proposed that this occupation should be effected mainly bvBritish or United States troops, but it is now considered that in order to avoidcausing offence either to France or to Spain, both countries should be invited to associate themselves with the occupation. The number of troops required tomaintain order would, in any case, be small and it should be possible to arrangefor the supply of equal contigents from Great Britain, the United States ofAmerica, France and Spain. The importance of avoiding offence to eitherFrance or Spain outweighs the local inconveniences which this arrangement might be likely to cause.The United States Government have shown considerable interest in the futureof Tangier, and there is reason to believe that they will be prepared to participate in the new regime. I consider that everything possible should be done to encouragesuch participation. In particular it is clearly desirable that arrangements shouldbe made to permit the active association of the United States with the restoredinternational regime, pending the negotiation of a new agreement. If. should beof considerable assistance to us in countering attempts by either France or Spainto increase their influence in the Zone.On the other hand, I would not recommend that the Soviet Union should beinvited to participate.   Imperial Russia was, it is true, a signatory of the Act
of Algeciras, but the Soviet Union has no historical connexion with the TangierZone and has never shown any interest in it, nor should she be encouraged todo so.I would propose, therefore, if these views are approved, to open discussions with the United States in the first instance and, when broad agreement has beenreached, join with them in discussion with the French Government with aview to (a) concerting a joint communication to the Spanish Government on theconclusion of hostilities in Europe; which would lead up to(b) agreement on the modifications which should be made to the existingTangier Statute before the latter is reintroduced to cover the interim period pending the conclusion of a fresh Treaty;(c) the summoning of an international conference to determine the final form which the regime should take.
