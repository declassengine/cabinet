THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PR*1AJESTY &apos;S GOVERN ME NTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 234.11th April, 1945.IIWAR CABINET.HOUSING-TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION-USE OF parks and OPEN SPACES.THE Housing Committee, at their meeting on the 19th February (H. (45) 5thMeeting, Minute 2), invited me, in consultation with the Secretary of State forScotland, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister of Works andthe Minister of Town and Country Planning, to draft a Bill for accelerating theacquisition by local authorities of sites in parks and open spaces for temporary houses and to submit the draft Bill to the War Cabinet for approval of theprinciple.   The draft Bill is annexed to this paper.2. Under the existing law, the use by Local Authorities of public open spaces for temporary houses, without the provision of other land in compensation,may be authorised by Provisional Order, but this procedure is protracted. Thedraft Bill provides an expedited procedure, to operate for a limited period of twoyears, under which the Health Ministers may authorise a local authority to use for temporary houses an open space vested in them, but such authority may begiven only where the appropriate Planning Minister certifies that such a use ofthe open space is expedient in the public interest in consequence of the emergencythat was the occasion of the passing of the Housing (Temporary Accommodation)Act, 1944, and in the particular circumstances of the case. The intention is thatsuch a certificate would be given only after the Planning Minister had made aspecial survey of the area of the local authority, brought under review all classesof unbuilt-on land, and satisfied himself that there was no available alternativeland having regard to sound planning considerations. The draft Bill providesthat temporary houses erected on open spaces in pursuance of these powers mustbe removed after not more than ten years, and the land restored.3. The provisions of the draft Bill are needed, and would be used, only ina few of the most densely populated areas, and in the main only the fringesof open spaces abutting on roads, and thus already serviced, would be taken. Theproportion of any open space which would be temporarily alienated would becomparatively small.4. Dearth of sites which can be brought into use for temporary houses is nota major problem with the large majority of Local Authorities. Exceptionaldifficulties in this respect, however, face the Local Authorities of a few largebomb-damaged towns in England and Wales, where needs are great but wherelittle undeveloped land remains in their areas. Their difficulties have beenaccentuated by the requirement that American houses must form a substantial proportion of their allocation of temporary houses; a requirement which isnecessary because American houses must be distributed to bomb-damaged areas inorder to comply with the terms of their supply. To minimise the fire risk,American houses must be kept at least 20 feet away from existing buildings thatare not of incombustible construction. The result is that small vacant plots inbuilt-up areas are unsuitable for them, and the number which can be placed onplots in built-up areas is generally not more than three-quarters that of Britishhouses. Notable examples of large towns where exceptional difficulties arisethrough scarcity of sites are London, Manchester and Birmingham.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.[29662]
5. 12,000 temporary houses, including 4,000 American houses, have been allocated to the London County area. The London County Council and theMetropolitan Borough Councils between them have so far selected 7,352 sites.The County Council have informed me that they see no prospect of the fullallocation for London being taken unless authority is given to erect some on thefringes of public open spaces.6. The Manchester position is that 3,000 temporary houses, including 1,200American houses, have been allocated to them. The Council estimate that withinthe City boundaries they have sites for only a three-year programme of permanenthouse construction, and they are unwilling&quot; to make any serious inroad withtemporary houses on this limited capacity for permanent houses. They have sofar found 1,430 sites for temporary houses, and propose that the remainder shouldbe erected on open spaces. The Regional Planning Officer, after a careful examination on the spot, is satisfied that 1,000 will have to be erected on open spaces because alternative sites are not available.7. A similar situation arises in Birmingham, where the allocation is 4,500,including 2,000 American houses. The Regional Planning Officer is satisfied thatif the full allocation is to be taken, 490 must be erected on open spaces.8. The large Local Authorities faced with these exceptional difficulties areat one with Ministers in deprecating the alienation of open spaces. It is a case,however, of balancing urgent housing needs against the temporary loss of amenitywhich would result from the use of the comparatively small amounts of open spaceinvolved. The safeguards in the Bill are such as to ensure that open spaces willnot be used for temporary houses except where it is proved up to the hilt that noother sites are available having regard to sound planning. Where such proof canbe shown, the alternatives appear to be either to authorise the use of fringes of open spaces with the temporary loss of amenity or to reduce the allocations of temporary houses to the Local Authorities concerned and thus deprive them of theopportunity of taking their appropriate share of the national provision of temporary houses.9. The use of public open spaces for temporary houses has so far not been raised acutely in Scotland; but the Secretary of State desires the Bill to extend to scotland so that powers may be available to deal, as a last resort, with any difficultcase that may arise, e.g., in Glasgow or Edinburgh.(Initialled) H.
