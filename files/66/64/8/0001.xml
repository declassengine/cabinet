THIS DOCUMENT IS THE) PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECEET.W.P. (45) 208.31st March, 1945.WAR CABINET.INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF COLONIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THERE is one small point in the Deputy Prime Ministers paper(W.P. (45) 200) of the 28th March last on which I feel I must make the attitudeof the Foreign Office clear.2. In paragraph 1 (i) the Deputy Prime Minister states that the colonial secretary recommended that we should not agree to the suggestion that theMandatory System might be extended to &quot; any other territory which mightvoluntarily be placed under trusteeship.&quot; It is no doubt true that there may be some slight risk in our doing so in that it is conceivable that the United states may &quot;voluntarily&quot; place her existing colonial dependencies under any system that may be agreed to at San Francisco, and that, if she did this, the other colonial powers might be placed in a rather invidious position. But I do not feel in thefirst place that this is very likely to happen and, even if it did, I should have thought that we and the other colonial Powers could easily have resisted any suggestion that we should do likewise.3. However this may be, I must point out that the Yalta agreement onterritorial trusteeship (copy attached) does appear to commit us to agreeing that,if any system of territorial trusteeship is set up, it should apply to &quot; any otherterritory which might voluntarily be placed under trusteeship.&quot; For this reasonI do not consider that we are at liberty to inform the Americans or anyone elsethat we should be opposed to the acceptance of this principle.A. E.Foreign Office, 31st March, 1945.TERRITORIAL TRUSTEESHIP.It was agreed that the five nations which will have permanent seats on theSecurity Council should consult each other prior to the United Nations Confer-ence on the question of territorial trusteeship.The acceptance of this recommendation is subject to its being made clearthat territorial trusteeship will only apply to (a) existing mandates of the Leagueof Nations; (b) territories detached from the enemy as a result of the present war;(c) any other territory which might voluntarily be placed under trusteeship; and(d) no discussion of actual territories is contemplated at the forthcoming united nations Conference, or in the preliminary consultation, and it will be a matter for subsequent agreement which territories within the above categories will beplaced under trusteeship.Copy No.L29500J
