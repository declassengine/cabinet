THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 226.9th April, 1945.IWAR CABINET.        \ /POLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will wish to see this record of a conversation between mr. Warner, head of the Northern Department of the Foreign Office, and dr. Stefan Litauer.A. E.Foreign Office, 9th April, 1945.Dr. Stefan Litauer came to see Mr. Allen and me to-day. He arrived back from Moscow on the 1st April and it is a little over three weeks since he was in poland. When in Poland he had covered a good deal of ground, having been asfar west as Katowice (in the last half of February), which was then only some30 miles behind the Russian front. He had also been to Lodz for twelve days,Cracow, Czestechowa, Kholm, Warsaw several times and Lublin.It is not very easy to pin Dr. Litauer down to categorical statements. Heis diffuse and is apt to enlarge on a general statement by giving one or twoindividual experiences in considerable detail. The following are, however, the impressions which he made on Mr. Allen and me on the more important points : (1) It was quite erroneous to think that the Russians in fact controlledeverything in Poland. As a result of a good deal of questioning, Dr. Litauergave the impression that, in his view, they only directly intervened in securitymatters. There was a Russian Commandant in every important town, but therewere very few Russian troops in any but the forward area and the police forces and all the local authorities were Polish. The Polish police, or rather militia,had been recruited from the Communist Party partisans; these were not at alla success, as they were undisciplined and given to excesses; they were beingreplaced by troops from the &quot; Berling Army,&quot; who were being formed into a security militia, under the control of the Communist Minister of Internal security and under the command of a Communist Colonel, who had been active in theSpanish Civil War.(2) Dr. Litauer said that the &apos;&apos; terrorist &apos;&apos; activities of the UndergroundHome Army which had been quiescent during December and January increasedtowards the end of February after the Crimea Conference and after the PolishGovernment gave the order to disband, which was undoubtedly interpreted to mean that they should go underground and carry on activities against the existingadministration. The Underground Army was almost entirely confined to east of the Vistula (those west of the Vistula had been almost completely liquidatedas a result of the Warsaw rising) and were comparatively small in numbers; he put them at ten to twelve thousand.   They were being drastically dealt witK.(3) Dr. Litauer gave the impression that the present administration were doing a pretty good job of organisation with the very limited means at theircommand and that there was a widespread feeling of relief and pleasure that poland was being run by a patriotic Polish Government and not by the Russians.Dr. Litauer said that, in particular, University and other teachers, the legal profession, including judges, and the Church were all co-operating with theGovernment and carrying on their vocations.12740   [29630]
2(4) As regards the political parties, it was rather difficult to get a clearview from Dr. Litauer. His impression appeared to be that active members ofthe Socialist and Christian Labour Parties would support the present administra-tion, although they would probably be critical of the personalities representingtheir Parties in the Provisional Government. As regards the Peasant Party, hesaid that there was still a good deal of support for M. Mikolajczyk, althoughit was diminishing. He added that the National Democratic Party was ofcourse outside the Government; but some of the younger members of the Party had sent a message to the Government indicating that they might be prepared tosupport it if they were admitted to representation and that Berut had immediatelygone off to have discussions with them.   He did not know the result.(5) As regards the agrarian reform, Dr. Litauer said that those peasantswho had no land or only a small holding, were naturally pleased because they received land under the reform. The larger peasant proprietors were critical.We have often been told that the peasants said that the reform was uselessbecause they had neither implements nor horses with which to work the land.Dr. Litauer said that this difficulty was being most successfully overcome by theorganisation of co-operative arrangements, implements and horses taken fromthe big estates being held for the common use.(6) As regards industry, Dr. Litauer explained that in most cases the proprietors were no longer available as Germans had been put in during theGerman occupation and a large number had been Jews, who had been liquidated.In these circumstances, the Government had to take over the industries and theywere being run by experts with a Works Committee. Dr. Litauer said that oneof his own cousins, who had been manager of a factory, had been reinstalled asthe expert in charge of the same factory.(7) An important point made by Dr. Litauer was that there was completedistinction, as regards morale, between the people in the territory which hadbeen incorporated into the Reich and those in the Gouvernement-General. In theformer, which had been closely controlled and administered by the Germans and where rations had been properly distributed, the discipline and morale of thepeople were good and life was carried on in an orderly manner under the present administration. In the Gouvernement-General, the people had becomedemoralised, there had been during the German occupation a tremendous black market and there had been a premium upon indiscipline and action againstthe German authorities. The result of this was that the people here wereundisciplined and discontented indeed, he thought many of them probablypreferred life under the Germans.(8) It was very difficult to judge how much of all this was special pleading.Dr. Litauer undoubtedly wishes to paint the picture in the best possible colours.At times I got the impression that he was being less than frank; but at the sametime, it was not easy to believe that the whole picture he painted was an entirelyfalse one and that the completely black picture painted by M. Fouchet, theFrench Delegate at Lublin, as recorded in Moscow telegram No. 1093 is to beaccepted without any qualification.C. F. A. WARNER.Foreign Office,4-th April, 1945.
