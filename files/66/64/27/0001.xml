THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 227.10th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.VISIT OF DELEGATION OF NATIONAL FARMERS&apos; UNION to new ZEALAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE War Cabinet may be interested to see the annexed despatch from theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in New Zealand about the recent visit to new Zealand of a delegation from the National Farmers&apos; Union. The delegationset out on their tour of Australia and New Zealand, with the approval of theUnited Kingdom Government Departments concerned, for the purpose of makingcontacts with kindred organisations in the two Dominions.C.Dominions Office,10th April, 1945.ANNEX.Of/ice of the High Commissioner,for the United Kingdom,Wellington, N.Z.(No. 6.   Confidential.)My Lord, 29th January, 1945.IN my telegrams No. 460 of the 19th December last and Nos. 13 and 23 ofthe 9th and 16th January respectively, I had the honour to refer briefly to press reports and comment on the visit to this country of the delegation of UnitedKingdom farmers.2. The delegation arrived by sea at Auckland on the 13th December and left again from Auckland by air for Australia on the 19th January. Their pro-gramme while in this country was in the hands of the Secretary of the NewZealand Farmers&apos; Union, Mr. A. P. 0&apos;Shea. It included visits, necessarily brief,to most districts of both the North and South Islands, conferences in Wellingtonwith the principal representatives of the New Zealand Primary Producers&apos; Asso-ciations and others, and a short period over Christmas during which the dele-gation dispersed to spend the holiday as the guests of individual farmers invarious parts of the country.3. The most important engagement of the delegation was the conference(from which the press was excluded) in Wellington on the 11th January, at whichthey met representatives of : The New Zealand Meat Producers&apos; Board.The New Zealand Dairy Board.The New Zealand Wool Board.The New Zealand Sheepowners&apos; Federation.The New Zealand Fruitgrowers&apos; Federation.The Dairy Producers&apos; Association.The New Zealand Council of Commercial Gardeners.The New Zealand Pig Breeders&apos; Association.The Town Milk Producers&apos; Federation.The Electoral College of the Meat and Wool Boards, andThe New Zealand Farmers&apos; Union (which convened the Conference).[29641]
24. The delegation impressed the conference by their realistic approach tothe post-war marketing position of the world so far as primary produce isconcerned. They said that farmers in Britain were determined that 1930-34should not be repeated, and that everyone in England, Scotland and NorthernIreland was of the same mind. They also pointed out that farming must play a large part in a full employment policy in Great Britain, and indicated thatthe proposition put forward at the Empire Producers.&apos; Conference in Sydneyin 1938 still held, i.e., that the farmers of the United Kingdom should have thefirst right to the home market. They pointed out very frankly that britain was going to be up against it from a foreign exchange point of view, and thatit would be essential for her to conserve her foreign exchange by producing asmuch as possible at home and by exporting as much as possible, and they indicated the vital part which farming could play in this connexion. They also preachedthe necessity for New Zealand to buy United Kingdom  roods as far as possible,and indicated their intention of impressing on the manufacturers in the UnitedKingdom the necessity for making articles suitable for New Zealand conditions.5. After outlining the views of the various groups of political parties in britain in respect of imports of food, they stressed the necessity for intra-Empire and ultimately international co-operation in order to achieve orderlymarketing, and they advocated the institution of an International Farmers&apos;Organisation to assist towards this end. They laid emphasis on the necessityfor the full employment of the industrial population of Great Britain, and told the conference very plainly that if New Zealand was going to make it possiblefor Britain to continue to import food, the only way was for the United kingdom to keep up her export trade, and in this New Zealand must assist.6. There was, I am told, some suspicion early in the Conference, particu-larly with regard to the restriction of imports of food into Great Britain, but mr. Turner pointed out very forcibly that Britain did not offer an unlimitedmarket for food, and that if New Zealand desired to exploit her potential produc-tion to the full it would be necessary to start to tackle the problem of an expandingmarket now and to look at things from a world viewpoint.7. The following resolution was passed unanimously at the conference and published : :&apos;That this fully representative Conference of primary producers ofNew Zealand warmly welcomes the proposals of the United KingdomFarmer&apos; Delegation and strongly recommends that delegates be sent to theconference of Primary Producers&apos; Organisations in London in October 1945.This Conference also expresses the hope that an International Federation of primary Producers&apos; Organisation will be established. Further, that this conference agrees that the representative Primary Producers&apos; organisations of the Empire and the United States of America be invited to the Conferencein London.&quot;8. At the Government reception to the delegation held in AVeliington onthe 12th January, Mr. Fraser, referring to the above resolution, stated that with-out consulting the Cabinet he could say that the idea of the primary producers ofthe Commonwealth and of the United States meeting for discussion had hissupport.9. I understand that Mr. Turner, the leader of the United Kingdom delega-tion, was insistent that these resolutions should include a reference to thedesirability of bringing in the United States. He had some difficulty in con-vincing the New Zealand members of the conference that this was necessary, butapparently stuck to his point in deference to what, as I understand, he knew tobe the wishes of the United Kingdom Government. Finally, he succeeded incarrying the point with the New Zealand members to the extent that a reference was included in the published resolution.10. The Secretary of the National Farmers&apos; Union has informed me that he regards the visit as having been an unqualified success and has expressed to me theview that the membership of the delegation could not have been better selected.He regards a most important beneficial result of the visit as far as New Zealandis concerned to be the dissipation of the belief that the United Kingdom offers avirtually unlimited market for New Zealand exports. The delegation was at pains to emphasise that, if present United Kingdom output was to be maintained and present New Zealand output increased (as is the Farmers&apos; hope), it will benecessary for New Zealand to seek new markets in Europe and elsewhere.   The
Secretary&apos;s only adverse comment on the arrangements for the visit was that itwas too short; and he hopes that it may be possible in the not too distant future fora similar delegation to spend a much longer time here.11. At the end of the delegation^ tour Mr. Turner had a talk with meregarding their impressions of New Zealand. He began by saying what everyvisitor to New Zealand begins by saying, that they had been overwhelmed withkindness and hospitality. They had all been greatly impressed by the beauty ofthe country, the fertility of the soil and the excellence of the climate, but hethought that farmers were trading on the fertility of the soil : it was notinexhaustible and much sooner than farmers thought they would have to cometo the plough. The climate was marvellous and farming was almost too easy,especially sheep farming. They had seen some magnificent flocks and herds he mentioned especially Romney sheep but be thought that the introduction of somefresh blood from England was desirable. They had not found much sheep andcattle disease, but he considered that it was bound to come unless steps were taken.The amount of good land was limited, and he had been distressed at seeing theamount of good land being ruined by weeds owing to lack of labour. He said thathe had seen farms which had so deteriorated that in war time they would havebeen taken away from British farmers. He thought that the proportion of cattleto sheep could be increased with advantage.12. He had been greatly disturbed at the amount of erosion he had foundin various parts of the country. The Government did not appear sufficientlyalive to the danger, and he had taken occasion to speak to the Prime Ministerspecially on the subject. He would like to see a great deal more tree planting.He had seen a good deal of good farming and he had also seen a good deal of poorfarming. There were some things which British farmers could teach New Zealandfarmers contrary to what the latter thought!13. He said that New Zealand farmers generally seemed to regard theBritish market for primary produce as a limitless sponge which could suck upeverything which the New Zealand farmer liked to send. He thought that the delegation had done very valuable work in disabusing the New Zealand farmers&apos; of this idea some of the things they had said had not been popular. In thisrespect many of the working farmers seemed more reasonable than the farmers&apos;leaders, who were inclined to be very rigid in their ideas. The delegates generallyhad been disturbed to find the bitterness between the two political parties in NewZealand, and the suspicion of the Government entertained by the farmerseverywhere.14. I enclose a press report of the delegation^ farewell message to theDominion, together with a copy of the January issue of Straight Furrow, theofficial organ of the New Zealand Farmers&apos; Union. It will be seen that much ofthe latter is devoted to various aspects of the United Kingdom farmers&apos; visit.15. The members of the delegation, and especially Mr. Turner, their leader,are most warmly to be congratulated on the success of &quot;their visit. They made an excellent impression everywhere, and there is no doubt that the visit has done agreat deal of good.   I hope that it may be the forerunner of other similar visits.16. I am sending a copy of this despatch and enclosures to the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner at Canberra.I have the honour to be,My Lord,Your Lordship&apos;s most obedient, humble servant,H. F. BATTERBEE,High Commissioner.
