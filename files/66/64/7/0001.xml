THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PRCIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.   It is issuedrsoiial use of top SECRET.W.P. (45) 207.31st March, 1945.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER ALLOCATIONS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 1945.1. The Ministerial Committee on Man-power have reviewed the man-power situation in accordance with the Prime Minister&apos;s Directive of the 26th February(W.P. (45) 117). By reductions in the Service intakes and in the labour employedin the munitions industries, they have found it possible to provide a substantial increase in the man-power available for civil production during the first sixmonths of 1945.2. The details of the reductions and allocations determined after consulta-tion with the Departments concerned are given in the Appendix to thismemorandum.Action is proceeding in accordance with the allocations set out in theAppendix; and the Committee recommend that these should now be formallyapproved as the basis for executive action.3. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has asked the Committee to preparefurther plans on the assumption that the European war will end not later than the31st May, 1945, bearing in mind that, should we suffer an unexpected reverse inGermany, it might be necessary to revert to the assumptions on which planninghas hitherto proceeded, and conversely that an earlier date than the 31st May forthe end of the European war is also a possibility.The Committee have accordingly invited the Service and Supply ministers to formulate as a matter of urgency proposals, based on the new assumptionsuggested by the Prime Minister, on which revised allocations of man-power mightbe made. These proposals will be submitted for the approval of the War cabinet or the Defence Committee, as necessary, before their man-power implications areassessed. It has been suggested to the Ministers concerned that they should con-concentrate primarily on proposals which are likely to yield the greatest immediatereturn in the release of man-poAver, and should not delay the submission of those proposals-until all the implications of the revised assumption have been worked out.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.J.

(45) .117) suggested aiming at an increase of275,000 in the labour force allocated to the Board of Trade. The actual labour force working for the Board of Trade in Group I industries at the end of 1944 exceeded by 68,000 the totalassumed in the Board of Trade&apos;s requirements, and there must further be added the 25,000to 30,000 counted, against the Supply Departments which are actually engaged on civilian work;thus yielding an effective total, compared with the 275,000 of the Prime Minister&apos;s Directive,of 250,000.II.

The possibility of substantially increasing the building labour force by making further reductions in munitions programmes and by shortening the period between the end of the European war and the first releases under the demobilisation schemeis, however, being considered (cf. IT. (45) 9th Meeting).
