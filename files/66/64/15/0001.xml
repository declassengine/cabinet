Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET. /       Copy No.    0 rW.P. (45) 215, \   i4pn7i 1945. \/WAR CABINET.ELECTORAL (MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) BILL.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland.THE War Cabinet agreed on the 1st November, 1944, to certain proposals for legislation submitted by us which arose out of the report of the Speaker&apos;conference on Electoral Reform, and to the appointment of a Committee to under-take an examination of certain further suggestions made by the Speaker&apos;s Con-ference for the amendment of the Electoral Law (W.M. (44) 144th Conclusions,Nos. 1 and 2). This Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Cecil Carr, the speaker&apos;s Counsel, has now submitted an. interim report on the matters (a) to (/)set out in para. 6 of W.P. (44) 591 of the 25th October, 1944.It was contemplated that two Bills would be introduced. The first Bill, the representation of the People Act, 1945, has now been passed into law. It dealtwith : &apos;(1) The assimilation of the local government and parliamentary franchise;(2) The revival of local elections; and(3) The removal of the right of a husband or wife to the Business Premisesfranchise by virtue of the qualification of his or her spouse.The matters to be considered for inclusion in the second Bill, an Electoral(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, are : I. The outstanding recommendations of the Speakers Conference,including those recommendations referred for further examination tothe Carr Committee, on which the Committee has now reported. (Therecommendations which have been approved by the War Cabinet are shown on Appendix I. The ones which require approval are set out below.)II. Such minor modifications of the existing law as are required to facilitate the candidature and election at local elections of persons serving withthe forces, war workers serving abroad, and merchant seamen.III. A provision for securing the secrecy of the ballot in Universityconstituencies.IV. A provision to remove the need for the compilation of an ad hoc Registerduring the first eight months of 1946, and subsequent years.V. Provisions for the compilation of a new Jury List.I. Outstanding Recommendations of the Speaker&apos;s Conference.(a) Agents&apos; fees.The War Cabinet asked us with regard to agents&apos; fees, which the Speaker&apos;conference had suggested should be included in the legal maximum of candidates&apos;expenses, to consider the exclusion of fifty guineas of the fee from the permittedscale. We have discussed this matter at a private and informal talk with the ChiefParty Agents. They are not in favour of excluding a part of the agenfs fee andthey appeared to regard the existing provisions of the law which exclude from the permitted scale  50 of the agent&apos;s fee in the case of boroughs, and  75 in the caseof counties as giving rise to unsatisfactory anomalies.   We propose, therefore, to[29585]&apos; &quot; b
accept the recommendation of the Speaker&apos;s Conference that the whole of the feespaid to agents should be included &quot;in the legal permitted maximum of election expenses; but the next paragraph should be considered in relation to this point.(b) Legal maximum Scale of Candidates&apos; expenses.The War Cabinet agreed that effect should be given to the recommendationsof the Speakers Conference that the legal maximum of candidates&apos; expensesshould be a basic figure of  450, with an additional allowance of \\d. for eachelector in a county constituency, and Id. for each elector in a borough constituency,but that if, on introduction of the Bill, it was found that the House felt strongly that the maximum should be higher, the Government should be prepared to reconsider the matter. We have discussed this matter also privately andinformally with the Chief Party Agents.It is clearly right that the cost to candidates of fighting an election shouldbe kept as low as is compatible with the need that they should be able to put before the electors the issues at an election. If the maximum is fixed too low,candidates will not be able to do this. This was recognised by all the PartyAgents, but they took the view that the maximum recommended by the Speaker&apos;conference should, in normal years after the war, suffice to enable elections tobe properly contested. On the other hand they were generally agreed that pricesof printing, paper, &amp;c, are abnormally high at present, and though some thoughtthat a satisfactory election campaign could be conducted on the proposedmaximum scale, they agreed that some over-all percentage of increase of themaximum (say 25 per cent.) would be justified for the first general election andfor any bye-elections held before the date of the next general election after it.The Agent of the Liberal National Party expressed the view that the maximumwould not be enough for counties and pressed that the basic figure for countiesshould be  500 as against  450 for boroughs. This proposal received no support from the other Agents.There is, in our opinion, a good case for some temporary increase to meet the exceptional price level arising from shortage of labour and materials, and werecommend accordingly that the maximum (to include the agenfs fees) as pro-posed by the Speaker&apos;s Conference should be adopted, with a proviso that for thenext general election (and any subsequent bye-election until the second generalelection) there should be allowed an additional 25 per cent, overall increase, the25 per cent, to be calculated in the case of each constituency on the basic figure of 450, plus the allowance for each elector (one penny for boroughs and three-halfpence for counties). Figures are given in Appendix II to illustrate how this increase will work in a borough or county constituency of 50,000 electors.(c) Matters Examined by the Carr Committee.(i) Use of Schools and Halls for Election Meetings.The Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended that, all schools and halls maintained in whole or in part out of State or local funds should be made available to candidates for election meetings and maximum charges should be regulated inrespect of such schools and halls to take account only of expenses of lighting,cleaning and heating. Premises exempted from the payment of rates shouldnot lose entitlement.to such exemption merely by reason of their being used for election meetings.The Can- Committee point out that this recommendation, if literallyimplemented, would raise formidable difficulties as the phrase &quot; all schools andhalls maintained in whole or in part out of State or local funds &quot; would cover a wide range of Government, University and local government buildings whichwere not constructed for public meetings, and which could not be released forsuch purposes. The Carr Committee reached the conclusion that in view ofthe increased school accommodation which will be available for candidatesunder the existing law, as a result of the Education Act of 1944 and thecorresponding Scottish legislation, no further statutory provision of schoolpremises for election meetings is necessary.   The recommend, however :-(1) That halls normally used for letting and maintained from public funds should be made available for engagement by candidates at reasonabletimes, subject to any bona fide contract previously entered into by theauthority controlling the hall.(2) A candidate should be able to get from the returning officer a list of schools and halls available for use in his constituency, and in the caseof schools the local Education Authorities should book them for him.
(3) The statutory use of schools or balls should be at reasonable times during,a period not exceeding three weeks before polling day.(4) The prescribed maximum charges both for schools and for halls should,in addition to covering the actual cost of lighting, cleaning andheating, include an item to cover the cost of the hire of caretakers inthe case of schools, and of the usual attendants in the case of halls.The Carr Committee find no difficulty in giving effect to the recommendationof the Speakers Conference that halls used for meetings should not lose exemption from rating.The Carr Committee mentioned that it was brought to their notice that some members of Parliament consider that no charges should fall on the candidatein respect of expenses for the statutory use of schools or halls, and if the candidateis to pay nothing, the expense will have to be borne by the local authorities (orother owners or managers of schools or halls used for meetings) or else theExchequer. They point out that when schools are used for an election meetingthere is not ordinarily a loss of revenue to the managing body, whereas when amunicipal hall is so used at a controlled charge, there may be loss of a potentialprofit, for recovery of which the local authority might look to the Exchequer.The Committee makes no recommendation in this matter and confines itselfto saying that to place burdens of this kind upon the State would perhaps be in line with the change made in 1918 when the returning officers&apos; expenses ceased to be the personal liability of candidates and became payable from public funds.We do not consider that there is sufficient ground for relieving candidatesof all expenses in the use of schools or halls, nor do we consider that the exchequer should reimburse local authorities for the loss of a hypothetical profit which itmight be impracticable to assess.Subject to this, we recommend that the proposals of the Garr Committeeshould be generally approved, and that the Bill should include a provision thatthe public authorities responsible for a school or a hall should be required to prescribe a maximum scale of charges for the use of their building, such charges to include only the actual cost of lighting, cleaning, heating and caretakers orattendants, in order to secure that candidates shall know in advance the cost which they will have to meet, and that they shall all be charged alike irrespective of party.(ii) Expenses incurred by unauthorised persons.The Speakers Conference recommended the amendment of section 34 of the representation of the People Act, 1918, which is in the following terms :  &apos;&apos; A person other than the election agent of a candidate shall not incurany expenses on account of holding public meetings for issuing advertise-ments, circulars or publications for the purpose of promoting or procuringthe election of any candidate at a parliamentary election unless he is authorised in writing to do so by such election agent.&quot;The Conference recommended the omission of the words underlined in orderthat all expenses incurred by the political or other organisation for the purposeof promoting or procuring the election of a candidate should be brought to account. The Carr Committee find no difficulty in giving effect to this recom-mendation, and make detailed suggestions as to how it could best be achieved.They add that, they see no reason why the proposed provisions should not apply with the requisite adaptation of machinery, to similar expenditure incurred in local government elections, but as they did not examine the question of extending the provisions of the Act of 1918 to Local Government elections, it would seempremature to deal with such elections in the Bill.Subject to this, we recommend the adoption of the proposals of the CarrCommittee.(iii) Speakers&apos; Expenses.The Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended an amendment of the law to makelegal the payment of speakers&apos; expenses. The Carr Committee report that atpresent the reimbursement of the travelling expenses of a voluntary speaker orlecturer is a legal payment which has to be returned in the electoraraccount. but any payment by way of remuneration or subsistence or refreshments is apparentlyillegal, although it appears that in practice payments to speakers for subsistence[29585] B 2
and even fees for. speaking are camouflaged under innocent heads of expenditure.The Carr Committee consider that, if, in order to prevent evasion of the law,fees and other payments to speakers are recognised as authorised expenditure,they should be included under a separate heading in the election return of expenses, but not all members of the Committee were agreed as to the desirabilityof committing themselves to the recognition of fees to speakers pending thegeneral review of the law of corrupt and illegal practices which the Committeewill make.We recommend that legislation on this point should bs postponed until theCommittee has presented its final report.(iv) Relief in respect of Venial Errors.The Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended that relief in respect of venial errorsshould be obtainable in the County or Sheriffs Court instead of by making an application to the High Court. The Carr Committee has prepared a listof the venial errors in respect of which a simplified procedure would be appropriate, and suggest that the jurisdiction in respect of these matters mightbe entrusted in England and Wales to the acting returning officers rather thanthe County Court, and in Scotland to the returning officer, subject to a rightof appeal to the High Court in England and the Court of Session in Scotland.In our opinion there are objections in principle to giving this function to anon-judicial officer such as the Acting Returning Officer in England and Wales,and we recommend that the County Court and the Sheriff Court proposal beadopted for adjudicating on the list of venial errors suggested by the CarrCommittee. .(v) Prohibition of Broadcasting from a Foreign Station.The Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended the prohibition on a British subjectof broadcasting matters affecting a parliamentary election from wireless stationsoutside the &quot;United Kingdom. The Carr Committee point out a number of thedifficulties which will be encountered in formulating and enforcing a wide pro-hibition of this kind, and recommend that, if this is made an offence, the scope ofthe offence should be restricted by the substitution of the words &quot; intended to influence &quot; for &apos;&apos;&apos; affecting.&quot; They think that a prohibition of this kind, thoughdifficult to enforce, might have a salutary deterrent value. It would appear thatthe prohibition was recommended by the Speaker&apos;s Conference in order to preventthe use of the w ireless by any person or political party at the time of an election and not because of any fear that the wireless might be used to mislead the electorsfor subversive or revolutionary ends. A prohibition on the latter ground would,of course, be useless because it could not cover all broadcasting abroad by aliensor broadcasting by a foreign Government.So long as there are broadcasting stations abroad, which are run on commerciallines, we cannot exclude the possibility that such stations might be hired by a candidate or a political party or an organisation supporting a political point ofview for propaganda purposes.As a matter of principle, we agree that this would be a most objectionableabuse of broadcasting and. ought, if possible, to be prohibited before it develops.There are, however, a number of practical difficulties in creating an effectiveprohibition, which are set out in Appendix III.The matter for determination is whether the deterrent value of a prohibition,which cannot cover the whole field, is outweighed by the possibility that in practice it might prove to be unenforceable, and to be unenforceable in the most glaring-cases, with the result that the law may be brought into contempt.If it is decided that legislation on this subject should be undertaken, we think the most appropriate method would be to make it an offence for Any British subject to broadcast from a foreign station any matter with intent to influence the manner in which persons in this country shall vote atany election (parliamentary or local Government).Any person (whether British subject or alien) or any organisation inthis country to procure or attempt to procure any person abroad to use aforeign station for such a purpose.(vi) Polling facilities in rural areas.The Speaker&apos;s Conference recommended increased polling facilities in rural areas. The Carr Committee reports that increased facilities can be arranged for under the existing law by administrative action, and fresh legislation is not
necessary. Their examination of the problem has, however, brought to light afew small points of detail on which amendment of the law would be desirable.The necessary provisions will be included in the Bill.II. Provisions to Modify the Existing Law in favour of Members of local councils now Serving in the Forces who may, while still Serving, wishto be Candidates at Future Elections.Representations have been made to the Service Ministers that persons serving in the forces should be given facilities to stand for local elections, when they areresumed in the autumn.It will not be practicable to give persons in the forces the same facilities inthis respect as are given to them to contest parliamentary elections, but theService Ministers are considering to what extent Service Regulations can be relaxed to permit servicemen to take part in local elections. On the assumptionthat persons cannot be released from the forces to contest a local election, someamendment of the law must be made to enable candidates to comply with theprovisions of law relating to nomination, acceptance of office and return of election expenses.We recommend that the necessary amendment of the law on these points should be included in the Bill so as to allow a candidate to accept nomination by telegram and if elected to make a declaration of acceptance of office by letter ortelegram and to extend the period for making a r iurn of election expenses.III. A Provision for Securing the Secrecy of the Ballot in UniversityConstituencies.Representations have recently been made that the system of the Secret Ballotshould be introduced in the election of Parliamentary Representatives of universities. The present voting document sent to University Electors is acomposite document containing the actual ballot paper and a declaration ofidentity to be filled in by the elector before recording his vote. In order to securethe secrecy of the ballot, it will be necessary to provide by Act and regulations for the use of a separate ballot paper and a separate declaration of identity asissued to absent voters at ordinary constituencies. It is understood that thismatter was brought to the notice of the Speaker &apos;s Conference, but the Conferencerefrained from making any recommendation upon it, possibly because they considered that there was no evidence of harm having resulted from the voting-arrangements at Universities. The secrecy of the ballot is, however, in ouropinion, a question of principle, and we recommend that the opportunity shouldbe taken to bring the voting arrangements at Universities into line with those for ordinary constituencies in this respect,Owing, however, to the need for advance preparations to be made forthwithby the Universities to deal with service postal voting applications, it would not,we think, be practicable to make these provisions effective for any election heldthis year. We recommend that this change of the law should not come into effect until after the next general election.IV. Provision to Remove the Need for the Compilation of an &quot; Ad Hoc &quot;Register during the First Eight Months of 1946 and Subsequent Years.The present position is that the annual Register to be published on the15th October will be effective for parliamentary elections initiated before theend of the year, but that, for elections initiated between the 1st January andthe 10th September in 1946 and subsequent years, ad hoc Registers will have tobe compiled under the 1943 Act. There is the further consideration that the1944 Act, which amended the qualification for registration from a period oftwo months ending on the last day of the month before initiation, to a qualifying-date which is the last day of the last month but one before initiation, will expireat the end of the year unless renewed by resolution of both Houses.For bye-elections initiated between the 1st January and the 10th Septemberin 1946 and subsequent years it will no doubt be possible to print ad hoc Registers,but experience in the compilation of the May Register has shown that the printing-industry will not be in a position in the near future to print ad hoc Registers
for the whole country for the purpose of a general election. Furthermore, it hasbecome evident that the staffing position of Electoral Registration Officers hasnot improved and the prospectof any immediate improvement is not apparent.The difficulties in the way of operating the two months&apos; residence qualification of the 1943 Act, which necessitated the passing of the amending 1944 Act, still remain and justify the retention of the registration qualification contained inthe 1944 Act. It must also be remembered that, under the 1943 procedure, therewill be a delay of some seven and a half weeks between the initiation of the election and the date of the poll, and that this delay may be found in some cases, at anyrate, to be politically inconvenient.Since the electoral machine must be ready to deal with a general electioninitiated at any time of the year, there appear to be only two methods ofovercoming these difficulties. Either the annual Register published on the15th October should be given a twelve months&apos; validity for parliamentarypurposes, or a second register should be published six months later, this registerto be effective for parliamentary elections only. Having regard to the movements of population which are to be expected in the post-war years, and the objectionsto holding a general election on an unduly stale register, we have come to theconclusion that the only possible course is to provide in the Bill that a registershould be published on the 15th April, for which the qualifying date should bethe 31st December. We suggest, however, that there should be power in the Billto prescribe a later qualifying date if staff and printing facilities should permit of this being done. The production of two annual registers will be a reversion tothe procedure in operation between 1918-28, after which it was discontinued onthe grounds of economy. The Bill should also contain a orovision extending theAct of 1944.At the present time it is difficult to forecast conditions beyond the immediatefuture. Accordingly we propose that, while the arrangements proposed should only apply specifically to next year, there should be power, by Order to be approved by both Houses, to prolong the arrangements.V. Compilation of Jury Lists.Provision also requires to be made for the compilation of fresh jury lists.The present position is that the 1940 jury lists still stand. Examination hasshown that no undue hardship on possible jurors is thereby caused, although,owing to the heavy number of removals, a large number of jury notices require tobe sent out in order to ensure an adequate supply of j urors.The difficulty under existing electoral arrangements is that the person withknowledge of jury qualifications, i.e., the person with access to the Rate Book,may not and probably will not be the person who in counties is charged with thepreparation of electors&apos; lists. It will therefore be necessary to provide that theelectors&apos; lists shall, on publication, be passed to the appropriate RatingAuthorities in order that persons liable to common and special jury service canbe indicated and that, after they have been so marked on the Register, there shallbe an opportunity to lodge objections before the new jury lists become effective.We ask for the authority of the War Cabinet for the preparation of a Billto give effect to these proposals, with a view to its early passage into law.H. M.T. J.Whitehall, S.W. 1,4:th April, 1945.
772APPENDIX I.Outstanding Recommendations of the Speaker&apos;s Conference on which theWar, Cabinet have already reached a Decision (War Cabinet (44) 144).(a) University representation.That every person who has received or receives a Degree (or its equivalent)shall be automatically registered, and that no fees shall be charged for registrationexpenses.Issue of poll cards by the Returning Officer.That poll cards should be issued to electors by the Returning Officer at publiccost. (It is proposed that this provision shall not come into force until a date to be fixed by order.)Acceptance of nomination papers by Returning Officers.That it should be made lawful for nomination papers to be lodged with the returning Officer at any time between the issue of the writ and nomination day.(If there is opposition to this proposal in the House, it is to be reconsidered.)Forfeiture of deposit.That where there are more than three candidates (or in the case of a doublemember constituency more than six candidates) the deposit should be returnedif a candidate polls one-tenth of the total votes cast; and that adjustments shouldbe made in the provisions with regard to forfeiture of the deposit in the case of university constituencies. (The War Cabinet also took note that certain legalobscurities with regard to the returning of deposits where candidates died or were raised to the Peerage, should be removed.)A bsent voting by persons physically incapacitated.That the categories of persons entitled to be placed on the Absent Voters list should be enlarged to cover persons who are physically incapacitated.Hours of Polling.The War Cabinet, at the same meeting, decided not to accept the recom-mendation of the Conference that the hours of polling should be the samethroughout the United Kingdom, and should be from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.(Note. Any candidate can obtain these hours on simple request to the returning Officer.)APPENDIX II.Candidates&apos; Expenses.Comparison of Scales in a County and Borough Constituency of 50,000 Electors.Existing Scale (Qd. for each elector in a county constituency.)(5d. for each elector in a borough constituency.)     s.   d. &apos;County   (50,000x 6^.)............       1.250   0   0Borough (50,000 x 5rf.)............       1.041 13   4Scale recommended by the Speakers Conference (Basic  450 plus l\d. allowance for each elector in a County, and Id. allowance for each elector in a Borough.)     s.   d.County   ( 450+ \\cl. x 50,000) .........       762 10   0Borough ( 450 + U. x 50,000)......       ...       658   6   8Temporary Scale proposed for the next General Election (and any subsequentbye-election until the second General Election) ,     s.* d.County   ( 762 10   0 + 25% addition)......       953   2 6Borough ( 658   6   8 + 25% addition)......       822 18 4
APPENDIX III.Prohibition of Broadcasting from a Foreign Station.1. There are limits within which our law can deal with acts committedabroad. Our law can prohibit any person in this country, whether British oralien, from procuring or attempting to procure any person to do an act abroad.It can also prohibit the doing of an act abroad by a British subject, but pro-ceedings for the commission of the offence cannot be instituted until the personreturns to the jurisdiction. For our law to make punishable conduct by aliensresident abroad would be an exceptional course, which might possibly be justified on the ground that broadcasting to listeners in this country necessarily involvessome part of the transaction taking place in this country. But here, again, if theprohibition extended to aliens residing abroad, they could not be punished unless they chose to come to British territory, and since the recommendation of the speaker&apos;s Conference did not include broadcasting abroad by aliens, we think thatany proposed legislation should, in its application to persons residing abroad, be confined to British subjects.2, Should a prohibition apply only at the time of an election, and, if so, howshould the time of an election be defined for such a purpose 1 Should it cover bye-elections ? The use of a foreign station would not seem a likely or effective meansof reaching the electors of a particular constituency, and it is more probable thata foreign station might be used for general propaganda purposes in order to induce electors generally to vote for candidates of a particular party. Therewould appear, however, to be no justification for discriminating in this matterbetween a general election and a bye-election, or for allowing a person to broad-cast before an election is initiated and not afterwards. In our opinion, it wouldnot be practicable to confine a prohibition to an election in being, and it would benecessary to frame it in general terms applying in future, so as to prohibit anybroadcast made with intent to influence the manner in which persons in the UnitedKingdom will vote at a parliamentary election. It might be argued that so widea prohibition would threaten the position of British lecturers, broadcasters andpublic speakers who may have occasion to give talks on foreign stations for thepurpose of explaining the political situation in this country to foreign listeners,but as it would rest with the prosecution, to prove that the broadcast was given&quot; with intent to influence,&quot; this argument loses much of its force.3. Proof of the commission of an offence might be exceedingly difficult.Before proceedings could be instituted against a person for broadcasting abroad,the evidence necessary to support a charge would have to be available s The broadcast would have to be specially &quot; monitored &quot; so that evidenceof what was said over the air could be placed before the Court;Witnesses might be needed to speak from personal knowledge to the voiceof the broadcaster so as to establish his identity. As it is easy to be mistakenabout the identity of a voice, their testimony might have to be corroborated byother evidence;It would be necessary to prove that the broadcast was given &quot; with intent to influence.&quot; This should not be difficult if the propaganda is of a crudeand direct form, but it might not be easy if the propaganda were merelytendentious and of a less obvious character, though it might be equallypernicious.Difficulty of proof has recently come prominently to notice in connection withthe arrangements which are being made to bring to justice notorious renegadeswho have been broadcasting for the enemy. Corroborative evidence in their cases will, it is to be hoped, be obtained when Germany is entered by the Allied Forces,but there will be no means of obtaining access to the records of a foreign stationwhich had been used by someone merely for political purposes. It follows thatany person or organisation in this country wishing to use a foreign station for political purposes in defiance of the law might find ways and means of doing so without incurring the risk of prosecution.
