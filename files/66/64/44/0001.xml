Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 244.13th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.THE ISLE OF PURBECK.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.THE Cabinet has recently had before it (W.M. 24 (45), Conclusion 4) thequestion of the requisition of land for public purposes after the war, and, underthe Requisitioned Land and War Works Bill, now before Parliament, an impartialCommission is to be set up to ensure that the treatment that is meted out to thepeople of the areas affected is fair and that they will not be unnecessarily orarbitrarily deprived of their homes. This right of appeal has generally been regarded in Parliament as an essential safeguard. But it now appears thatthere are certain cases that are not covered by the Bill, and in which, therefore,no appeal to the Commission set up under the Bill will lie. In these casescompulsory powers of purchase under the Defence Acts, 1842-1935, will beapplied, and where they are exercised there is, I understand, no right of appeal.A case in point, to which I would draw the attention of my colleagues, isthe Isle of Purbeck. This is an area in the South of the County of Dorset,running from Poole Harbour in the East to Lulworth Cove in the West. Itis approximately eleven miles long and eight miles broad. It is extremelybeautiful, quite unspoilt and contains a number of exquisite villages and someof the finest manor houses in the South of England. It is visited by many thousands of holidaymakers every year, and should, one might have thought, havebeen one of the areas most certain to be scheduled for preservation under anyplanning scheme. During the present war more than half of the Island wasrequisitioned by the military, and the population were turned out. The farmers,villagers and others affected accepted the position without complaint and moved into temporary billets elsewhere until the war was over and they could returnto their homes. It was never suggested to them that their exile might be permanent. Recently, however, grave doubts have arisen as to whether the WarOffice has any intention of releasing this area when peace comes. These doubtsapply in particular to the Western end of the Island. Representations from theWareham and District U.D.C. met, after a delay of almost a year, with thefollowing reply : &quot; It is still not possible to give a decision on the post-warretention or release of this area, as it will depend on the permanent traininglay-out of the Army. The War Office does not consider it likely that any decision can be reached until the War is over,&quot; and 1 had a similar answer to a letter which I personally wrote to the Parliamentary Uncler-Secretary of State forWar. Extremely bitter feelings have been aroused among the people of the Island.One lady from the Western end has written to me : &quot; We all felt our evacuationwas a contribution towards winning the war, but now that we are threatened with permanent deportation as if we were East Prussian Nazis, it is too much/&apos;She says that her family have lived in Purbeck since 1345. and in their presenthouse for over three hundred years, and adds : &quot; In that time roots go down far.&quot;There is no doubt that this feeling is shared by all sections of the community in Purbeck, and will be echoed by all who know this most lovely corner of Englandwhich has in it, within a few square miles, so many national monuments datingback, some of them, to pre-historic times. No doubt, if the Isle of Purbeck hasa special value in the eyes of the War Office, that must be taken into account,though even then one might have thought that the other considerations thatI have mentioned would prevail. But what does seem essential is that in caseslike this, which are not covered by the Land Requisition and War Works Bill,there should, before any final decision is taken by any Service of other Depart-ment. be a right of appeal to an impartial Commission, such as is provided underthe Bill now before Parliament.Copy No.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,13th April, 1945.1&quot; 296881
