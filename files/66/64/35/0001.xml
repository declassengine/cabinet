Printed for the War Cabinet   April 1945.W.P. (45) 235.11th April 1945.SEC.RET.WAR CABINET.Copy No:DOUBLE TAXATION.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.WHEN the War Cabinet discussed double taxation on the 28th March itwas decided (W.M. (45) 37th Conclusions, Minute 3) &quot; that before a final decision was reached, it would be as well that the Cabinet should have before them suchparticulars as could be made available giving :  (a) the approximate total of United States investments in the UnitedKingdom and of British investments in the United States;(b) an estimate as to the probable effect of the scheme on trading profits;(c) an estimate of the amount of &apos;&apos; hot money &apos;&apos; which might be removed from London, if adversely affected by the scheme.&quot;2.   The answers to these questions are as follows : (a) (i) United States investments in United Kingdom marketable securitiesare estimated at  110 millions. It is not known what proportion ofthe investments is in equities and what is in fixed-interest securities.It is believed that practically the whole of the latter are represented by British Government securities, the interest on which is alreadyfree of United Kingdom tax to non-resident holders. In the case ofthe equities the dividend is liable to our standard rate of tax andremains so under the Agreement,(ii) United Kingdom investments in United States marketable securitiesare also estimated at  110 millions. The great bulk of these is equityshares, and the remainder fixed-interest securities. On the fixed-interest securities the United States abandons its tax and on theequities it limits its tax to 15 per cent, (in lieu of the present 30 percent, withholding rate plus surtax).(b) No statistics are available to show the amount of trading profits madeby British concerns in the United States. They would include notonly the profits of branches or subsidiary companies of trading-concerns but also the profits of branches or subsidiary companies ofBritish insurance and financial concerns. In pre-war days they were about  5 millions, but they may possibly reach as high as  10 millions.The effect of the Treaty would be to give relief (partly borne by theUnited States but mainly borne by the United Kingdom) of 1^ millions for every  5 millions of profits.Trading profits made in the United Kingdom by United Statesconcerns are believed to be about  8 millions. These profits remainliable to United Kingdom income tax and the existing United Stateslaw gives relief from United States tax in respect of the UnitedKingdom tax.(c) Under the existing system of Exchange Control it is not open to foreignholders of sterling balances to Avithdraw them freely. Therefore,even if certain holders of &quot; refugee &quot; funds conceive themselves to be adversely affected, there will be little or nothing they can do about it.If additional &quot; hot money &quot; of this kind is deterred from coining toLondon in the future, I should look on that as an advantageJ. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,llih April, 1945.[29664]
