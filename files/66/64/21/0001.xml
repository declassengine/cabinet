Phis document is the property of His Britannic Majesty,s GovernmentPrinted for the War Cabinet, April, 1945SECRETCopy No.   3 iw.p. (45) 2216th April, 1945.WAR CABINETpav of nursing officers of the army and theroyal air forceWAR SERVICE INCREMENTSJOINT MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR ANDTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR AIRI. The White Paper (Cmd. 6553), issued in September, 1944, which announced the introduction of war service increments, Japanese Campaign pay and Far East allow-an c.c. for members of the Armed Forces, stated that each of these additional emolumentswould be issued to women members of the Forces at appropriate rates.2. There is a difference of opinion between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and ourselves as to the eligibility of Nursing Officers for the war service increments, which* are granted to all ranks below Rear Admiral, Major-General and Air Vice-Marshal whohave rendered 3 years&apos; reckonable service since 3rd September, 1939. The officers&apos;rates vary from 2s. 3d. to 3s. od. a day, according to rank, for 3 years&apos; war service,with am addition, varying from gd. to is. od. a day, according to rank, for each subse-quent year&apos;s war service.   Women officers receive two-thirds of these rates.3. It is not in dispute that Nursing Officers are members of the Armed Forces ofthe Crown. They were declared to be so by an Order in Council in 1941, and anotherOrder in Council in 1941 provided that they should receive commissions.4. The Chancellor has agreed that, in accordance with the provisions of the white paper, Nursing Officers should be eligible for Japanese Campaign pay and the Far Eastallowance at the appropriate rates, subject to the prescribed conditions, but he feelsunable to agree that they should similarly be eligible for the war service increments.His objection is based on the fact that the pay of Nursing Officers is related to the salaries of civilian nurses, and that, only some 18 months ago, their rates of pay wererevised to conform with the rates approved for nurses in civilian hospitals as the resultof the recommendations of Lord Rushcliffe&apos;s Committee on Nurses&apos; Salaries (Cmd. 6424).He says that the rates of pay of Nursing Officers are, in fact, civilian rates and make full provision for the grant of increments in respect of length of service, and he sees no justification for superimposing on these rates special increments for service in excess ofthree years, for which the Forces&apos; Pay Code did not adequately provide in other cases.Such a concession would be likely to lead to a demand for similar improvements in the salaries of civilian nurses, involving the Exchequer in additional expenditure of severalmillion pounds a year for an indefinite period. Notwithstanding the fact that NursingOfficers serve, or are liable to serve, overseas and often in close proximity to active operations, he holds that, in general, their position cannot be distinguished from thatof civilian nurses, who are, and will long continue to be, in many cases engaged innursing Service casualties. If the salaries of civilian nurses were increased/NursingOfficers would expect a corresponding increase, and they cannot reasonably be giventhe best of both worlds.The Chancellor does not think that the Government can fairly be held to be committed by the terms of the White Paper on this point. The White Paper is couched in general terms, and the Government must maintain the right to decide whether thebenefits arc to be extended to any particular category whose case presents specialfeatures, such as Nursing Officers who have no male counterparts. There are othermembers of the Forces, e.g., Naval Officers and men serving on T.i24* engagements,who will not receive war service increments.   He is not moved by the fact that Armv* That is to say &quot; engagements at Merchant Navy rates of pay &quot;.
V.A.Ds. are eligible for war service increments, since they are paid at Army (A.T.S.)rates and not, like the Nursing Officers, on the basis of civilian salaries. He has, never-theless, agreed that, so long as it is understood that the position of Nursing Officers willnot be held to be prejudiced thereby, Air Force V.A.Ds., although paid on a civilianbasis, should receive war service increments.The concession to Nursing Officers of Japanese Campaign pay and the Far Eastallowance, is, in the Chancellors view, distinguishable, in that these emoluments are intended as compensation for service in the Far East and have a geographical basis, noris his opinion altered by the fact that Nursing Officers are, in accordance with precedent,to receive War Gratuity, which it is not proposed to give to members of the Forces who receive civilian rates of pay. He regards the grant of War Gratuity to Nursing officers as perhaps somewhat illogical, though he agrees that there could not have been anyserious question of withholding it on this occasion, - and that there is no real clanger ofcounterclaims from other classes having no such established title to it.5. We, on the other hand, feel very strongly that the Government is inescapablycommitted by the terms of the White Paper to grant the war service increments toNursing Officers as to other women members of the Forces, and that it would be quite impossible for us to defend their exclusion. If the question is raised in Parliament, aswe think it is bound to be sooner or later, the Chancellors decision will place us in anuntenable position, and it will, in our opinion, be much better to make the concessionat once rather than to have to yield later to a charge of bad faith.It is true that the pay of Nursing Officers is assimilated to that of civilian nurses,but it is, nevertheless, Service pay authorized, as in all other cases, by Royal Warrantor similar Instrument. It thus differs quite distinctly from the pay of officers like ArmyLand Agents who have been commissioned merely because it is necessary during the war that they should have military status in order efficiently to carry out their duties, but who continue to draw their civilian emoluments. It is true also that Nursing Officersreceive annual increments. But other members of the Forces receive increments of payfrom time to time based on length of service, and they are not thereby debarred from war service increments.The fact is, and it is so stated in the White Paper, that the Government, whileconsidering that the pay and allowances of members of the Forces and their families hadalready been brought up to a satisfactory level, deliberately decided to do something more for those who had given prolonged war service, and would continue to serve witha liability to hardships and danger which it is to be hoped will have been far removed from the great majority of civilians. We can see no sound reason, on merits, for the exclusion of Nursing Officers, who are and will continue to be liable, like other membersof the Forces, and to a greater degree than many other women members, for service in theatres of active operations. Of 10,380 Army Nursing Officers, 8,161 are nowoverseas, and, of 1,221 Air Force Nursing Officers, 525 are now overseas. Civiliannurses do not share this liability. We see no great difficult5&apos; in defending a distinctionon this ground between Nursing Officers and civilian nurses no more difficulty, in fact,than in the case of war gratuity and every difficulty in defending the present position;and we are, therefore, unwilling to accept it without a Cabinet decision.P.
