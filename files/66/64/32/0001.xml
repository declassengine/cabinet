(45) 232.10th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1945.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE Ministerial Committee on Man-power asked the Service and SupplyMinisters to consider the effect, both on Service intakes and on the labour forcein munitions, of the new assumption about the end of the German war set outin paragraph 3 of W.P. (45) 207.2. The Service Ministers have now stated that this assumption can inpractice make no difference to the intakes into the Armed Forces during the first half of 1945. It would, however, result in an earlier and greater release of man-power from the Forces in the second half of 1945 and subsequent periods.3. The effect of the assumption on labour for munitions has been examined by the Joint War Production Staff. Their Report, which is appended, shows the lines on which action is being taken. At this stage no statistical estimatecan be given of the total numbers likely to be released by these modifications in munitions programmes; but the administrative measures described in theReport will ensure that rates of production continue to reflect the progress ofthe war.The report makes it clear that further large-scale reductions in the munitionslabour force can be made only if a date for the end of the German war is laiddown without reservations; and, both for this reason and for the purposes ofman-power planning generally, I hope that the War Cabinet will now feel, ableto fix a firm date.J.

APPENDIX.[J.W.P.S. (45) 10.]MAN-POWER IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1945.Munitions Labour.Report by the Joint War Production Staff.IN pursuance of the conclusion of the Ministerial Committee on Man-power,the Joint War Production Staff have considered what proposals could be putforward for cuts in munition programmes based on the new assumption suggestedby the Prime Minister in his Minute to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a copyof which is annexed. They have thought it right to put forward this Report,which shows the lines on which action is being taken, without waiting for an assessment to be made of the savings in man-power which will result from this action. The scope of such action is, of course, limited by the reservations attachedto the date of the 31st May for the end of the European war. More drastic action cannot be taken so long as the possibility remains of having once more toaccept a later elate.2. There are two main directions in which saving can be sought. The first is in the reduction of the peaks m certain important items of which production is still being built up. The second is in a reduction of current rates of outputof stores where lower maintenance rates can now be assumed than have hitherto been allowed for.3. - The first of these affects the War Office particularly, the Air ministry to a lesser degree, and the Admiralty to a negligible extent. Field and medium artillery ammunition and tanks are the principal War Office items. Presentproduction plans for these are governed by decisions of the Defence Committee(Supply). The War Office are examining the position with the Ministry ofSupply in the light of the Prime Minister&apos;s Minute, and a joint paper will besubmitted to that Committee. The majority of the Air Ministry peaks havealready been eliminated, except where they are required to enable squadrons tobe rapidly re-equipped with modern types suitable for the Japanese war. TheAir Ministry are examining the position, and wall make such reductions as are possible.4. All three Service Departments are reviewing the current rates of outputof equipment, and will make such reductions as are possible without undue risk.The Admiralty programme is already largely governed by the demands of theJapanese war, and they will only be able to examine the comparatively smallfield of consumable stores. The War Office and the Air Ministry have a wider field to examine, and to start with they will give attention to those items whichare substantial users of labour and in which the rate of output required for stage II is considerably below that required for Stage I.5. There are certain factors which have to be borne in mind in making this examination. In the first place, Supply Departments will have to suffer aconsiderable uncontrolled diminution in their labour force on the terminationof the German war. This diminution will be brought about by the disappearancefrom industry of aged workers, married women, and others, whom it will notbe possible to retain in employment against their will. Unless this position iscarefully watched, the result of that uncontrolled diminution may well be tocarry the size of the labour force on (and consequently the production rate of)any particular item of munitions below the level required for Stage IT Inparticular, the Ministry of Aircraft Production labour force at the 30th June,1945, will not be greatly in excess of the numbers required in the initial monthsof Stage II, and in the opinion of Ministry of Aircraft Production the effectof such an uncontrolled loss would be particularly dangerous and it would benecessary to take special measures to make good such wastage.6. Secondly, in those items where the rate of output required for Stage IIis only slightly smaller than that for Stage I. the continuance of output at or about present levels in the next two or three months will not be wasteful even
if the German war ends quite suddenly. It will simply mean that the stockat the end of the German war will be somewhat greater than it might otherwise be, but, if so, this will permit of the rate of output in Stage II being reduced toa lower level than is now planned.7. The Joint War Production Staff understand that the difficulties of theMinistry of Labour and of the Board of Trade would be eased if steps were now taken first to cancel some long outstanding preference demands for labour, and secondly to reduce considerably the number of munitions items which figure onthe designated list. The Supply departments have been asked to examine theposition, and to notify the Ministry of Production jointly with the Ministry of.Labour as soon as possible of the extent to which these steps can now be carriedout.8. It will be evident from the above that the result to be expected will not be large in terms of man-power immediately released. It is, however, relevant toremark that under the reductions already agreed the munitions labour force willbe reduced by the 30th June to a figure half way between the peak of Stage Iand the eventual Stage II level. Moreover, the scrutiny of the current rates ofproduction which Service and Supply departments are now making will make some additional releases possible and it will be a progressive process in the courseof which the progress of the war can be reflected. It will not, however, be possiblefor further large-scale reductions to be made until a firm date can be selected,without reservation, for the end of the German war, and the Joint War Pro-duction Staff hope that such a date will be selected as soon as the course ofevents makes it possible. From the point of view of production planning, a rather later firm elate would be preferable to, and would produce bigger dividendsin terms of labour released than, an earlier date subject to reservations.(Signed) Ft. J. SINCLAIR.On behalf of the Committee.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W.1.7th April, 1945.Annex.Copy of a Minute (M. 268/5) dated 29th March, 1945, from the Prime Ministerto the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Our progress on the Continent seems to justify a revision of the &quot; Argonautdates for the end of the European war. I have referred this to the Chiefs of staff who have asked for time to consider the question. No doubt we shall know more in a fortnight. But we cannot delay the necessary studies for a single clay. YourMan-power Committee should therefore plan now on the assumption that theEuropean war will end not later than the 31st May, bearing in mind that if weshould suffer an unexpected reverse in Germany we might be forced to revert to the &quot; Argonaut &quot; dates, and conversely that an earlier collapse is also apossibility.
