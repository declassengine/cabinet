THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.CONFIDENTIAL.W.P. (45) 218.5th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.RECENT MINISTERIAL CHANGES IN CERTAIN INDIANPROVINCES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I append, for the information of my&apos; colleagues, a note on the ministerialchanges which have recently taken place in four of the Indian Provinces. Thedownfall of two Moslem League ministries, and the dependence of a third forits continued existence on Congress support, must amount to a substantial blow to the prestige of the Moslem League. It is not possible to say that the actionof Congressmen in the North-West Frontier Province and Assam portend anearly return of the Congress Party to the responsibilities of office which itrenounced in 1939 : but the possibility at any rate has been the subject of muchspeculation in the Indian press.L. S. A.India Office, 5th April, 1945.Sind.The present Prime Minister, Sir Ghulam Hussein Hidayatullah, has been in office continuously since October 1942. He is an adherent of the Moslem League,and his Ministry, a Moslem League coalition with the Independent Hindu Party,was formed with the blessing of Mr. Jinnah. In the middle of March this yearhe reconstituted his Cabinet for the second time within three weeks. On the first occasion, following a defection of some of his Moslem League supporters in theAssembly, he had filled a vacancy in the Ministry by appointing a non-LeagueMoslem. This was in defiance of the policy of the League according no recognition to Moslem elements outside the League. The League promptly asserted itscontrol and the Prime Minister had to give way and drop the newly-appointedMinister,This was a victory for the Moslem League, and a further example of the domination over a Provincial ministry which the League has endeavoured toexercise, following but with&quot; much less success the example of the control exercised by the Congress &quot; High Command &quot; over the Congress Ministries in1937-39.A ssam.The Moslem League Ministry under Sir Muhammad Saadulla a coalitionministry with certain Hindu and other elements has been in office since August1942. Recently it met some heavy weather and the Premier, seeing his followingin the Assembly diminish, was obliged late in March to reconstitute his Cabinet.The important point is that he had to turn to the Congress Party for support;and although the Party would not itself accept office it has promised its support to the ministry, which will include three Hindu members in addition to fiveMoslems and two others. The support has been given on the condition that political prisoners are released and the ban on public meetings and processionswithdrawn.Although the local Congress Party are not giving full co-operation to theextent of taking office, it is significant that Mr. Gandhi, who, of course, wasconsulted bv the leader of the Party, appears to have advised him to act as he[29597]
2thought best in the light of local circumstances. It is also noteworthy that theCongress Party is prepared to support a Moslem ministry.North-West Frontier Province.After 3i years of &quot;Section 93 Administration&quot; the North-West frontier province was &quot;able to return to Ministerial Government in May 1943 with aMoslem League Ministry under Sardar Aurangzeb Khan. But the position ofthe Ministry was none too secure, particularly after the return of the congress party to the Legislature last year and the &apos;release from detention of certainCongress members whose compulsory absence had contributed to the Premier&apos;sinitial majority. The recent defection of some of its supporters led to the fall ofthe Ministry early in March, -followed by the return to office of the local congress party under Dr. Khan Sahib, who was Premier of the Congress Ministry when itresigned in 1939.This replacement of a Moslem League by a Congress Ministry, particularlyin a Moslem Province, is a substantial blow to the prestige of the League. But itis not necessarily a prelude to the return of Congress to office elsewhere.Mr. Gandhi was consulted before the Ministry was formed, and is understood tohave given Dr. Khan Sahib a free hand to act as seemed best in the peculiarcircumstances of the Province. There is, however, little reason to think thatMr. Gandhi would be prepared to give a similar freedom of action to Congressmenin other Provinces administered by Governors under a Section 93 Proclamation.Bengal.The Moslem League Ministry (a coalition including non-Congress CasteHindus and representatives of the Scheduled Castes), which has held office underKhwaja Sir Nazimuddin since April 1943, was defeated by a snap vote on the28th March. On the following day the Speaker adjourned the Assembly sine dieon the ground that the Government having been defeated was functus ojficio. TheGovernor had no option but to issue a Proclamation under Section 93 and takeover the powers of the Ministry and the Legislature; the budget, which must begot through before the 31st March, had not yet passed the Legislature, and it wasnecessary for the Governor to ensure that supply should be legally provided forthe year beginning on the 1st April.It was latterly becoming clear that intrigues and ambitions among some ofSir Nazimuddin&apos;s supporters Avere causing a certain swing over to the Opposition,so that the defeat of the Ministry was not altogether a surprise. It seems atpresent that, if Sir Nazimuddin is out of it, there is no other politician on whomthe Governor feels he could rely to form a Ministry that would enjoy a reasonablestability and co-operate fully in the administrative responsibilities of war-time.If that is so, the Section 93 regime may have to last some months as it seems thatthe only promise of a cure for the present unsatisfactory political situation lies in a general election, which could not be held till towards the end of the year.
