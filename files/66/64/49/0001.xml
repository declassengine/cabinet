(45) 102) regarding a secret mission which was being sent to AdmiralMountbatten&apos;s headquarters at Kandy by the Siamese Regent. The purpose ofthe mission was primarily military but among its members was an ex-Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, Nai Direk Jainam, and it was anticipated therefore thatit might raise political issues.2. The War Cabinet, taking into account the benevolent attitude of theUnited States and China towards Siam, and the consequent desirability of some indication of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, decided to authoriseAdmiral Mountbatten to speak to the Mission either personally or through his political Adviser on the lines of the following formula :  &quot; It is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to see the restoration ofa free, sovereign and independent Siam, and a renewal of the old friendly,, relations between Great Britain and Siam. But the road to be troddenbefore this goal is reached is not a smooth one. Much will depend on themeasures which Siam takes to contribute towards the expulsion of theJapanese from Siamese territory and towards the ultimate defeat of Japan;and on her readiness (a) to make restitution to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand their Allies for the injury done to them in consequence of Siam&apos;s association with Japan and (b) to ensure security and good-neighbourlyrelations for the future. For the time being Flis Majesty&apos;s Governmentsinterest is concentrated upon the expulsion of the Japanese.&apos;.&apos;3. Admiral Mountbatten was instructed accordingly and the instructions were communicated to the United States Government and to the Prime ministers of the Dominions (of whom New Zealand, the Union of South Africa and australia are, like the United Kingdom, at war with Siam). The question of a communication to the Chinese Government was left open by the War Cabinet, andat the express request of Admiral Mountbatten on security grounds no com-munication has been made to them.4. By direction of Admiral Mountbatten, his Political Adviser,Mr. Dening, spoke to the Siamese Mission on the 26th February. A telegramcontaining Mr. Dening&apos;s report is attached as Annex 2. (In this telegram, asin all correspondence on this subject, the Mission is referred to as &quot; MissionSequence,&quot; the Siamese Regent as &quot; Ruth &quot; and Nai Direk as &quot; Omar &quot;.)5. Nai Direk explained, with the authority of the Regent, that SianFsdeclaration of war on Great Britain was the work of unscrupulous persons, whewere not representative of the people of Siam or their sentiments, which were of warm attachment to Great Britain. The Regent and his followers were anxious to do what they could to make common cause with the Allies in driving12751   [29710]&apos; BSECRET.   &apos; I.      Copy No-      00
the Japanese out of Siarn and in restoring good relations. Mr. Dening pointedout that if this situation was to be brought about, it would be necessary thatthe British people should be convinced of the genuineness of Siam&apos;s desire to makereparation and to take part in the common cause. He then spoke in the sense of the formula quoted in paragraph 2 above and Nai Direk gave assurances thatthe Regent and his followers would do everything to meet our requirementsincluding the restoration of territories acquired and restitution for damage done to British interests. In response to Mr. Dening&apos;s enquiry as to how the Regent&apos;party proposed to make common cause with the Allies, Nai Direk expressed theview that the present Siamese Government would be able to keep the Japanesein play while resisting as many of their demands as was practicable and safe.When the clay of invasion by Allied forces came, the present Siamese Governmentwould resign and a previously constituted Siamese Resistance Government would set up a new Administration in a place safe from the Japanese in order to help the Allies.6. In reporting this conversation, it will be seen that Mr. Dening expressedthe opinion that there could be no doubt about the genuineness of Nai Direk&apos;desire for collaboration.7. In the meantime, the State Department had received a documentcontaining certain proposals, as a basis of discussion, from the Siamese emissarysent to Washington and the Siamese Minister there, whom the United StatesGovernment have continued to recognise ever since December 1941. A summaryof this document was communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Washington.Although it resembled in some ways what Nai Direk had said to Mr. Dening,more particularly in proposing repudiation of the Siamese declaration of war against the Allies and of the acquisition by Siam of territory in Burma, malaya and Incio-China, there were important discrepancies. The Siamese Mission in washington proposed that a provisional Government should be set up outsideSiam and recognised by the Allies. It suggested that in regard to Indo-china the question of the future of the annexed territories should be submitted to aninternational commission. There was also a hint as to the desirability ofassurances from the Allies about the future independence and sovereignty of siam. Mr. Dening stressed that in his conversation with Nai Direk there hadbeen no suggestion of any conditions with regard to Siam&apos;s participation withthe Allies against Japan, The above discrepancies were therefore on my instructions at once pointed out to the State Department.8. The next development was a note from the State Department of whichthe text is contained in Washington telegram No. 1729 (Annex 3). This noteembodies the results of conversations with the Siamese Delegation and, in spiteof the view of the State Department to the contrary, the same discrepanciesappear. The State Department do not support the idea of the establishmentof a Free Siamese Provisional Government outside Siam, but suggest &quot; that theBritish, Chinese and American Governments might agree as an initial step toview with favour the establishment at this time of a Free Siamese LiberationCommittee abroad as the acknowledged symbol of the Free Siamese ResistanceMovement.&quot; The note proposes the establishment of such a Committee withWashington as its headquarters and representatives in London and Chungking,and states that Chiang Kai-shek has expressed his willingness to support sucha proposal.9. The question of recognising a Free Siamese Movement and a Committeerepresentative of that movement outside Siam is one which cannot be decided by His Majesty&apos;s Government without careful consideration or without consulta-tion with the Dominions. This is bound to take time. I thought it well, therefore,to authorise Lord Halifax to inform the State Department at once of my ownpreliminary reactions to the proposal, since otherwise there seemed to be apossible danger of our being faced by the United States Government with a faitaccompli. The State Department&apos;s note seems to me to bo an attempt to take the lead in a question where we have the primary interest as being the neighbourof Siarn and. at war with her; and I cannot help wondering whether thediscrepancies to which I have drawn attention do not owe something to Americanencouragement or inspiration. Indo-China, the encouragement of Free Siameseand declarations of sympathy with Siam are all matters in which the americans have long taken a peculiar interest. The text of my telegram to Lord Halifaxis attached as Annex 4, and I trust that my colleagues will approve my action and my views.   These are that while we must take seriously the Siamese Regent&apos;s
approach to us and must proceed on the assumption of his genuine desire for collaboration, the position created by Siam herself must be radically altered bythe Siamese before our old friendly relations with Siam can be restored ; that theestablishment outside Siam of a Free Siamese Liberation Committee is prematureand unwise, and that the most hopeful means of stimulating Siam&apos;s collaboration with the Allies is to develop the direct contact already established with theSiamese Regent until the moment is ripe for setting up a provisional Governmenton a portion of liberated Siamese territory as contemplated by the Regent himself.10. I regard it, however, as a matter of urgent importance that we should now determine, for the purposes of consultation with the Dominion governments and the United States Government, the terms on which we should be preparedto recognise and work with an effective Siamese Liberation Movement. Thereasons for urgency are several. A definite reply should be sent as soon aspossible to the State Department in order to forestall any possibility of prematureAmerican action. Admiral Mountbatten is engaged in operational planningaffecting Siam, and this involves planning for the administration of Siameseterritory and for political warfare to Siam. The Siamese will have to be told assoon as possible how we expect them to fulfil in detail the general assuranceswhich Nai Direk gave to Mr. Dening. Moreover, the willing collaboration of theSiamese seems likely to be a vital factor in securing the maximum quantities ofSiamese rice, which I understand will be needed to avert famine in Malaya andother neighbouring territories after liberation; and the sowing of the new cropis now not far distant. Finally, the possibility cannot be excluded that theJapanese will stage a coup in Siam similar to that which they have recentlycarried out in Indo-China : counter-action in such circumstances will stand agreater chance of success if our attitude towards, and relations with, the Siameseresistance movement have been determined in advance.11. The Far Eastern Committee, which was set up in order to keep underreview and to advise, in collaboration where necessary with other Committees,upon the general and economic policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom as regards the Far East and the Pacific, is charged in its terms ofreference with the special task of considering the future of Siam. It has alreadybeen engaged on preliminary studies of various aspects of this question, and i suggest that it should now be instructed to recommend, as a matter of urgency and for the consideration of the A.P.W. Committee, the conditions which a friendly Siamese Liberation Government should be required to accept before wecould recognise and collaborate with it.12. If my colleagues agree, I suggest that the directive attached as Annex 1should be sent to the Far Eastern Committee; and that the Dominion PrimeMinisters should be informed of the position for their most secret and personal information.A. E.Foreign Office, 13th April, 1945.ANNEX  1.DRAFT  DIRECTIVE TO  THE  FAR  EASTERN  COMMITTEE.THERE is reason to believe that a movement exists in Siam aiming at theestablishment at the appropriate moment of a new Government whose policy would be to repudiate the Siamese declaration of war, to restore friendly relationswith the Allies, and to make common cause with them in driving the Japanese outof Siam.2. In response to a recent secret approach from a representative of this movement the following reply was&apos; returned with the authority of the WarCabinet &apos;&quot; It is the desire of His Majesty&apos;s Government to see the restoration ofa justifiee, sovereign and independent Siam and a renewal of the old friendly relations between Great Britain and Siam. But the road to be trodden before this goal is reached is not a smooth one. Much will depend on the measureswhich Siam takes to contribute towards the expulsion of the Japanese from[29710] B 2
Siamese territory and towards the ultimate defeat of Japan; and on herreadiness (a) to make restitution to His Majesty&apos;s Government and their allies for the injury done to them in consequence of Siam&apos;s association with japan and (b) to ensure security and good neighbourly relations for thefuture. For the time being His Majesty&apos;s Governments interest is concentrated upon the expulsion of the Japanese.&quot;3. The War Cabinet now wishes the Far Eastern Committee, in pursuanceof its special task of considering the future of Siam and in consultation, as necessary, with other committees, to report to the A.P.W. Committee, as a matterof urgency, regarding the terms which any friendly Siamese liberation govern-ment should be required by His Majesty&apos;s Government to accept as a preliminary to recognition and collaboration.4. The Committee should take as its starting-point the formula quoted inparagraph 2 above, and should consider the types of injury to British and Alliedinterests which call for restitution.5. As regards future security arrangements, the Committee should act inthe closest consultation with the Chiefs of Staff.6. The Committee should take into account the importance of Siamese ricein the feeding of Malayan and other territories after liberation.7. The Committee should take into account the attitude towards Siam of theUnited States, China and France on which the Foreign Office will furnish advice.The Committee should be guided in particular by the correspondence between theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the United States Ambassador inLondon which has already been circulated to it.8. The Committee is, of course, free to draw attention to any other relevantconsideration.ANNEX 2.Mr. Dening to Mr. Eden. (Received 26th February)(No. 75.   Top Secret.)(Telegraphic.) 26th February, 1945.FOLLOWING Top Secret from Dening :-Supreme Commander&apos;s immediately preceding telegram.I saw Omar, together with two other members of the party, this morning atthe bungalow where they are accommodated. My conversation was entirely withOmar.2. I began by saying that I understood purpose of Sequence was military,but, since Omar had a political status, 1 enquired what the purpose of his visitmight be.3. Omar said that it was true that the object of the mission was military,but he was empowered by Ruth to explain that declaration of war against GreatBritain by Siam had been made by a few unscrupulous persons who were notrepresentative of the people of Siam or their sentiments, which were of warmattachment to Great Britain. The Siamese were very sorry that war had been declared on Great Britain, and Ruth and his followers were anxious to do whatthey could to make common cause with the Allies in driving the Japanese out of siam and in restoring relations.4. I said to Omar that, as he had been in England, he knew that publicopinion was a factor which every British Government had to take into account.As far as public of Great Britain was concerned, all they knew was that Siamhad asked for a non-aggression pact with us and that soon after it had been con-cluded she had allowed the Japanese to enter Siam and to attack us from Siameseterritory and had declared war on us. If, therefore, the situation was to bebrought about which the Siamese people, according to Omar, desired it would benecessary that the British people should be convinced of the genuineness of Siam&apos;desire to make reparation and to take part in the common cause.
5. I then spoke to Omar in the sense of paragraph 2 of your telegramNo. 66 to Supreme Commander, and Omar gave assurances that Ruth and his followers would do everything to meet our requirements, including restoration of territories acquired and restitution for damage done to British interests.6. I then enquired how, in practice, Ruth&apos;s party proposed to implement their expressed desire to make common cause with the Allies apart from the purely military considerations which were not included within the scope of myenquiry.7. Omar gave it as his opinion, which his colleagues seemed to share, thatthe present Siamese Government would be able to keep the Japanese in play whileresisting as many of their demands as was practicable and safe. He did not seemseriously to fear the danger of a Japanese coup d&apos;Etat, nor did he think theJapanese controlled sufficient puppets to set up an effective Siamese puppetadministration, and he thought that they would virtually have to take complete control themselves. I asked him if he was satisfied that his party would have sufficient advance details if Japanese were to attempt a coup d&apos;Etat, since theywere accustomed to strike suddenly and to preserve the utmost secrecy regarding their plans. Omar obviously did not know much about Siamese counter-espionagesystem, but declared [group undecypherable : ? himself] satisfied that Siamwould, in fact, know in advance, though he appreciated my warning.8. Omar said that plan of Ruth and his party was that, when the day of invasion by Allied forces came, present Siamese Government would resign, where-upon a previously constituted Siamese Resistance Government would set up a new administration in a place safe from the Japanese in order to help the Allies.(This idea, which was put forward without prompting, seems to be a good one.)At the end of the interview Omar repeated his expressions of regret for the factthat Siam should have declared war and the desire of Ruth and his party to collaborate with the Allies.  I told him that I would report what he had said.9. The atmosphere [group undecypherable] was friendly, and though Omarwas rather nervous at the outset, I think there can be no doubt about [group undecypherable : 1 genuineness] of his desire for collaboration.10. Since drafting the above I have seen Washington telegram No. 1257 toyou, and accordingly feel it necessary to stress that there was not in the course ofmy interview with Omar any suggestion on his part that there were any conditions[group undecypherable : ? with regard to] Siamese participation with the Alliesagainst Japan.ANNEX 3.Earl of Halifax to Mr. Eden. [Received 19th March.)(No. 1729.   Top Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, 16th March, 1945.FOLLOWING is text of a note dated 15th March from State Department: (Begins:)Reference is made to the British Embassy&apos;s aide-memoire of 7th March, 1945,in regard to a conversation on 26th February between Political Adviser to south-East Asia Command and Siamese emissary in Ceylon. It is noted that theForeign Office observe that there appear to be some discrepancies between state-ments made by Siamese emissary in Ceylon and those made, according to reportof British Embassy, Washington, to State Department by emissaries in washington.In the light of Embassy&apos;s aide-memoire, a careful review has been made ofthe record of conversations wdiich officers of the Department have had with theSiamese delegation. In brief, according to the Siamese delegation, the SiameseRegent desires to declare war on Japan and other Axis States (the Siamese statethat their own declaration of war on Great Britain and the United States isillegal and not representative of Siamese sentiments); to repudiate all treaties and agreements entered into by the former Premier, Pibul, since the decision of1941 (in this connexion the Siamese promise unconditional return to Burma and malaya of areas acquired by aiding Japan, but request that in post-war perioda British and American arbitration committee be set up to consider Siamese
claims to areas in Indo-China); to convince the Siamese people of Allied goodintentions and thereby unite the Siamese people and soldiers in support of allied military efforts in Siam against the Japanese; and lastly to establish a FreeSiamese Provisional Government abroad which would meet temporarily theneeds of the real leaders of the country within Siam and which would be dissolvedas soon as the Regent at Bangkok is in a position (presumably at the time theAllies enter Siam with military forces) to appoint a new Provisional Governmenton Siamese soil. (The same time sequence is suggested in the British Embassy&apos;saide-memoire on page 2, last sentence.)On the basis of statements in British aide-memoire, the Department does notconsider that there are material differences in proposals made to His BritannicMajesty&apos;s Political Adviser at Kandy and those made to officers of the Depart-ment by the Siamese delegation in Washington beyond those which might beexpected to arise from independent oral presentations of the same instructions.The Department has noted the statement made by the Political Adviser to theeffect that he &quot;judged the desire for collaboration to be undoubtedly genuine.&quot;The Department has reached the same conclusion, and has been impressed not only by the desire manifested by the Regent and members of the Siamese ressitancemovement to collaborate, but also by concrete measures taken and contemplatedagainst the Japanese. As a means of further stimulating a move of substantialpotential value to the Allies in connexion with operations which may be designedto expel the Japanese from Siam, it is believed that British, Chinese and american governments might agree, as an initial step, to view with favour the establish-ment at this time of a Free Siamese Liberation Committee abroad as the acknow-ledged symbol of the Free Siamese Resistance Movement. Generalissimo chiang kai-shek -shek has expressed to the American Ambassador at Chungking his willingness to support such a committee with Washington as its venue. Such a committee might well include representatives of the Regent to be stationed at London,Chungking, Washington, the capitals of the three principal interested united nations. The Department is convinced that the establishment of such acommittee, with the support of the three Governments mentioned, would be of definite value in the prosecution of the war in the Far Fast, and in promoting thecause of the United Nations.   [Ends.]My comments, will follow in a few days.ANNEX 4.Mr. Eden to the End of Halifax.(No. 3133.   Top Secret.)(Telegraphic.) For elan Office, %\si March, 1945.YOUR telegram No. 1729 fof 16th March :  Siam].Before a formal reply can be returned to the State Departments note it willbe necessary to submit the matter to the Cabinet and to consult the Dominions.This will require some time as it may involve the elaboration of the detailedconditions on which the Governments of Flis Majesty who are at war with Siamwould be prepared to reach a settlement with her or to collaborate with a newSiamese Resistance Government. Meanwhile my preliminary reactions are asfollows. If you see no objection, you should communicate them orally to theState Department.2. It seems clear from my recent, correspondence with the United states ambassador here (ending with my letter of 15th November, 1944) that theultimate objects of the United States Government and ourselves in regard toSiam are much the same. I hope, however, that the State Department willunderstand our position during the intervening period and will recognise thatthe problem of Siam is one which concerns us much more directly and much more closely than the United States. Siam is contiguous with Burma and Malaya.She went to war with us in spite of her non-aggression treaty with us. She has accepted certain British territories at the hands of the Japanese and has done usother damage. We therefore have to consider any Siamese approaches very carefully. It is impossible as yet to say in what form the eventual settlement with Siam will be embodied. But in one way or another the position created by Siam herself must be radically altered by the Siamese before our old friendly
relations with Siam can be restored. 1 hope that the United States Governmentwill not misunderstand this attitude of reserve on our part. In particular i hope that they will not conclude that we are not taking seriously the recentapproach by the Siamese Regent. On the contrary, we are proceeding on theassumption that there is no doubt about the genuineness of Ruth&apos;s desire for collaboration with the Allies.3. I still feel, however, that there are material differences between theproposals now made by the Siamese Delegation in Washington and what was said by Omar in Randy. The most striking is the proposal made in Washington forthe establishment outside Siam of a Free Siamese Provisional Government or atleast a Free Siamese Liberation Committee as the acknowledged symbol of aSiamese resistance movement. These proposals, of which no suggestion was madeby Mission Sequence, seem to be of doubtful practicability and expediency at thepresent time. Our experience of &quot; Free &quot; movements elsewhere does not encourageme to expect Useful results particularly when there are so few Siamese of influenceoutside Siam to form the nucleus of the Free Siamese Movement. It seems possible also that the setting up of a Provisional Government or LiberationCommittee outside Siam might add to the difficulties of any resistance movementinside the country and might only precipitate Japanese control. In any case, now that we have established direct contact with Ruth it seems better to continue todeal with him through existing secret channels rather than through intermediaries.4. Through Mission Sequence, as the State Department are aware, we havealready outlined to Ruth the steps which we expect Siam to take in order thatour old friendship with her may be resumed. I would suggest, therefore, thatthe most hopeful means of stimulating Siamese collaboration with the allies will be to develop this direct contact until the moment is ripe for setting upa Provisional Government on a portion of liberated Siamese territory as contemplated by Ruth himself.
