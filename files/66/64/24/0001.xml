(45) 224.7th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.BRITISH EXPORTS, GERMAN INDUSTRY AND REPARATIONS.AT first sight there appears to be a conflict of interest over the rebuilding of German industry. The smaller her industry, the smaller will be her war potential; but the smaller her industry, the smaller also will be the reparationswhich can be extracted in the form of manufactured goods. As far as this countryis concerned, this apparent conflict is, in my opinion, unreal. From the british point of view, the slower the recovery of German industry, the better. True,we shall not get manufactured goods as reparations. But we shall get what isinfinitely more valuable to us, namely, a considerable share of Germany&apos;s pre-warexport markets.For two years now the value of our imports (not counting munitions) has beenfive times the value of our exports. In other words, a large part of the food weeat at every meal, and of the raw materials used daily in industry, are gifts orloans from abroad.Nearly half our imports are on Lend-Lease or Mutual Aid from north america; when the war is over these gifts will cease. Much of the other half is on credit from other countries; as we have borrowed so much from themalready, we can hardly expect them to go on lending to us indefinitely when thewar is over.Merely to pay for food to keep ourselves alive, and for materials to keep ourfactories running, we must expand our present-day exports five times and thatin a very short time if we are to avoid becoming pensioners of North America.Ever since 1913 there has been an ominous downward trend in our exports(after allowing for price changes). By 1938, although the rest of world trade had increased, and the world demand for industrial products had risen by well over one-half, our exports had fallen to less than two-thirds of the 1913 level.During this war they have perforce been cut to less than one-third of even the 1938volume. In face of all the wartime industrialisation that has taken place inCanada, Australia, India, Brazil and other countries, and of the infiltration of american products throughout the world, it will be difficult enough to regain our1938 markets. But this will not suffice. Somehow or other we must in additionreverse the sinister decline that had been afflicting our exports for a generationeven&apos;before this war, and raise them in the course of a few years to one and a halftimes the 1938 level a truly gigantic task.And yet we must succeed if our plans for full employment and social reformare to be anything but a mirage, and if the influence we hope to wield in the worldis not to be paralysed by dependence on our creditors and shortage of cash.Our biggest opportunity lies in the capture of the German and Japaneseexport markets. Before the war, in a total world market for finished manufacturesof  2,000 million, we supplied goods worth  400 million, the Germans anotherMemorandum by the Paymaster-General.I. Our Export Problem.II.-The German and Japanese Export Markets.[29588]B
 400 million and the Japanese  175 million. Here then is an opening oftremendous importance. A substantial slice of the enemies&apos; export markets would go far to solving our problems.To-day we have a unique opportunity to achieve this. Our two major allieshave shown no exceptional solicitude for the future of German industry, and weshall soon be occupying the most important industrial area in Germany, devastatedby bombing and the ravages of war.If we decide to forgo this opportunity, if we decide that German industryand exports must be restored, let it be plain what this means to Britain. quite apart from questions of military security, it means deliberately throwing awaythe largest single chance we have of restoring and expanding our exports, without which we are&quot; condemned to poverty, penury, debt and decline. Only verycompelling reasons could justify His Majesty&apos;s Government in takingresponsibility for such a policy.III. Two Immediate Issues.A decision on these matters cannot be postponed. Two questions demandimmediate answers  (a) As soon as we have occupied the Ruhr there will be pressure from many quarters to restore its industry. It will be argued that the Germansmust send manufactures to their neighbours in payment of the repara-tions which are their due; that they must export in order to pay fortheir necessary imports; that their factories must be restarted if massunemployment, with all its social and political implications, is to be avoided.There are answers to these arguments, and they are set out below.-&apos; Here I am only concerned to emphasise that, if we accede to these demands, we shall not only be resuscitating our principal pre-warcompetitor in the export market; we shall have to restock andre-equip German factories largely out of our own pocket (at any rateuntil we can be recouped by the recipients of reparations at someuncertain future date); we shall no doubt have to contribute brainsand effort which we can ill spare from the task of getting our own industry going; and we shall be helping the Germans to make forthe European Allies, free of charge, manufactures which they would otherwise have bought from us for cash gold and foreign exchangewhich we cannot afford to forego.I therefore trust that we shall do nothing to encourage the rebuilding of German industry, at least without very carefullycounting the cost.(b) The second immediate question arises out of the appointment of aReparations Commission in Moscow. It was clear at Yalta that neither the Americans nor the Russians had given much thought tothe question; consequently a vigorous lead from Britain on a clear-cut policy might achieve considerable results. This makes it all themore necessary to consider very carefully what policy our representa-tives are to press.Some of the results of a decision to make Germany pay reparationsin the form of manufactured goods have already been described.Above all, it would rule out the only German reparations of real value to us her export markets. Moreover, although I am dealingprimarily with economic matters, it must not be forgotten thatGermany&apos;s capacity to make war follows from her capacity to manu-facture goods.   This should appeal to all the United Nations alike.In my view it should be possible to reach an agreement with theRussians by which they would take existing German machinery,forced labour and raw materials, while we should take Germanexport markets (and also perhaps certain special types ofexisting equipment, and raw materials like timber and potash);nobody would receive any manufactured goods a policy the americans would almost certainly endorse. It is true that this wouldinvolve the sacrifice by this country of reparations in the form of manufactured goods. But during the first few years, as theChancellor of the Exchequer has warned us in W.P. (45) 146, we
cannot hope to get much from Germany anyhow. And once our ownfactories have been reconverted, it is unlikely that Labour or capital would welcome a flood of German manufactures. In any event,Britain&apos;s share of such manufactures would certainly be worth verylittle compared with the value to us of German export markets.Some of the other Allies might of course like to have German manu-g factures, but their preferences must not be allowed to override ourvital interests. As the Russians have recognised, the needs of thecountries that have organised victory must take first place.IV. The arguments for restoring German Industry.We are not so much faced with the question whether or not to destroyGerman industry. A large part is, or will be, in ruins. What we have to decideis whether we are to allow and help the Germans to rebuild it.What compelling reasons might be held to justify our taking a step thatwould so grievously hamper our export, prospects % Certainly not that we needher manufactures as reparations. What other arguments are there ? three off those which are current may be briefly examined..(a) It is said that there will be mass unemployment in Germany after thewar if her industry is not fully restored.This argument, in my view, usually receives undue weight. The Germanmetal, engineering, electrical and chemical industries are the most important from the export as from the military point of view. They accounted for two-thirds of Germany&apos;s pre-war exports. But even in 1939, with rearmamentin full swing, they employed only 5 million people out of a total working popula-tion of 34 million.It is idle to pretend that a large part of these 5 million could not find workelsewhere. At least 2 million workers will be occupied for five years rebuildingGerman dwellings damaged or destroyed in the war and in building houses forthe Germans to be evacuated from the Eastern territories. Nearly 9^ million workers wore actively engaged in agriculture in 1925. Between 1925 and 1939nearly f million left the land; they might go back. And if the large estates werebroken up, another million workers could be settled on the land. Some 3 millionGermans, for whom work would otherwise have had to be found, have been killed in the war. By the time the Germans have met Russian demands for workers tomake good the ravages inflicted on their country a figure of 4 million has been mentioned there may well be a shortage, rather than a surplus, of man-power inGermany.Nobody maintains, of course, that the transition from war to peace willbe easy in Germany. To demobilise the German Armed Forces (9 million menincluding prisoners in Allied hands), and to shift perhaps 5 million munitionsworkers to peaceful pursuits, will tax German organising power to the utmost-Failure to restore German heavy industry may aggravate the inevitable problem of transitional unemployment, but it will hardly affect its order of magnitude.It may be that factory workers would prefer to stand at a bench rather thanwork on the land or build houses but the sacrifice of their preferences is not a heavy price to pay for starting the bloodiest war in history.(b) It has also been said that the Germans&apos; standard of life will be reducedto intolerable levels unless their industry is restored.This is another of those qualitative statements which does not bear quantita-tive analysis.For the last five or even ten years, nearly all German heavy industry, and much of her light industry, has been turning out predominantly munitions andwarlike stores. A small fraction of this capacity, devoted entirely to peace-time production, would give the Germans far more consumer goods and a higher standard of life than the)&apos; have had for a long time.Then it is said that Germany will be unable to export enough to pay forher necessary imports. The operative word here is &quot; necessary.&quot; Unlikethis country, Germany is very nearly self-sufficient in food-stuffs; even at theheight of her war effort in 1942-43 she produced enough on her own land toprovide a daily average of 2,300 calories per head nearly nine-tenths of her[29588] B 2      *r
total consumption. A relatively small increase in agricultural output wouldgive the Germans, without any imports at all, as many calories as most other european countries.Some fats would have to be imported, and probably a few million tons of grain to offset territorial losses in the East; but these, together, would notexceed one-tenth of the total value of Germany&apos;s pre-war imports.As to raw material imports, German civilians have managed for five yearspractically without overseas supplies; they have developed many kinds of ersatzmaterials, especially textiles. The need for imports of ores and metals will be greatly reduced if German heavy industry contracts. Thus, there is no doubt thatshe could survive with a much smaller industry, and much smaller exports,than before the war. There would be fewer motor cars and oranges, less coffeeand tea, but the basic essentials of life would be available.(c) It is argued that failure to restore German industry would impoverishEurope and the world.It is of course true, as an abstract proposition, that if productive capacity iseliminated, fewer goods will be produced than could be made if it remainedintact. But the question now is not whether German factories should be destroyed or not. Thejr have been destroyed. The question is whether they should berebuilt in Germany and employ German labour or whether the goods they could produce for export should be made here. Nobody seriously expects to get very much from the output of German factories in the first year or two. After that therewill not be any danger of the United Nations running short of the manufacturesthey want. There has been an enormous expansion in manufacturing output and capacity during the war. For example, the wartime increase in the outputof the British metal, engineering and allied industries has been at least two orthree times as great as the total pre-war export by similar Germany industries.The increase since 1939 in the output of American factories has been something like 25 times as great as Germany&apos;s total pre-war exports of manufactures; theexpansion of 33 million tons a year in American steel production is H timesGermany&apos;s total pre-war output of 22 million tons.The dependence of European countries on the German market is also apt tobe exaggerated. The industrial countries of the Continent will have no grounds for complaint. Before the war they sent only 13 per cent, of their exports toGermany, and they will surely gain on balance by a reduction of Germany&apos;scompetitive power; but even if they did not, we must consider our own needs first.As for the European producers of raw materials and food-stuffs, the onlycountries depending on the German market for more than one-fifth of their pre-war exports, apart from the Baltic States which are now part of Russia, were : Bulgaria, Hungary, Spain and Turkey, whose part in the war scarcelyqualifies them for special consideration;Greece and Yugoslavia, two small allies whose needs we can easily supplyand whose exports of ores and metals, timber, currants and tobacco we canreadily absorb.As for the overseas countries, practically every one of them, unlike the UnitedKingdom, is in a much stronger financial position than before the war and wellable to tide over any losses that might be involved.As a result of her fight to save liberty. Britain has become the greatest debtornation of the world. We have the right to demand that our interests be considered in the post-war settlement. Let us not forget that a weak Britain, strugglingwith unemployment and a low standard of life, her foreign trade reduced and her exchanges constantly threatened, might well impoverish the world far morethan a contraction in German industry.V. Other Arguments.In this note I have considered only the economic repercussions of ourtreatment of German industry after the war. But clearly the more we curtailher heavy industry, the greater will be our military security. It is comparativelyeasy to stop new factories being built.- But, once they have been built, it isnotoriously difficult to make sure that they are not diverted to wrong uses.It has also been argued that a lower standard of life in Germany might temptforeign capitalists, despite their experience after the last war, to erect factories in order to exploit the cheap German labour.   Naturally, if it is decided not to
restore German industry until she is fit to resume her place among civilisednations, this must not be allowed. No factories could be erected without specialpermission.It is sometimes said that a harsh settlement would be resented by theGermans and would stimulate a war of revenge. But surely no one who haslived through the past ten years still believes that Germany can be appeasedby soft treatment. Moreover, after the beating they have already had, theirpropagandists are bound to represent any settlement short of unconditional surrender by the Allies as iniquitous. It is the opportunity to do ill deeds that must be denied, at any rate until a new generation has grown up.We are often told that it is no use making arrangements now, howeverjust and however desirable, that will be considered harsh and oppressiveby the British people in five years&apos; time and thrown overboard. The shortanswer is that it is the first five years that count. When we have re-establishedour exports and are paying our way, we may be able to afford to be more generous.It is, of course, difficult to forecast the moods of the public five years ahead, but of one thing we can be certain : if they are then suffering from povertyand unemployment, they will find it very difficult to understand why this Govern-ment, at the end of a war in which so much had been sacrificed, deliberately helped to build up German competition in the export markets.Finally, the moral issue is perfectly clear. The vast foreign debts we have incurred, the loss of our overseas assets, of much of our shipping and of many ofour pre-war markets, in fact all the sombre aspects of our painful economicsituation, are the direct result of German aggression. Britain must expand her exports or starve. Germany, can live without. Everyone agrees that she shouldface sacrifices in order to repair the damage she has done to other countries.Who then can condemn Britain if she seeks restitution in the German export markets ?VI.-Conclusions.My conclusions are as follows : -1. It is far more important to this country to re-establish British exportsthan to obtain German manufactured goods as reparations.2. For this reason alone, we should discourage the restoration of german industry. But quite apart from this, such a policy would give far greater military security than any other scheme likely to be devised.3. The instructions to our representatives on the Reparations commission should therefore be to try to confine reparations to existing equipment,raw materials and, if the Russians insist, indentured labour.4. Meanwhile British representatives on the Combined Civil AffairsCommittee should be instructed to stop any efforts to rebuild german industry, especially heavy industry, whatever the reason, until thewhole question has been settled with our prinicpal allies.C.Great George Street, S.W.1,7th April, 1945.(
