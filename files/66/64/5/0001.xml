THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC! MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 205.31s  March, 1945.WAR CABINET.WORLD ORGANISATION.(a) Non-Permanent Membership of the Security Council.(b) Obligations of Members of the Organisation.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(a) Non-Permanent Membership of the Security Council.1. One of the most important matters to be discussed at the BritishCommonwealth meeting due to open on the 4th April is that of non-permanentmembership of the Security Council of the World Organisation.2. Chapter II (1) of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals (Cmd. 6560) runs asfollows : &quot; The Organisation is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States.&quot;Chapter VI (A) provides for the United Kingdom, the United States, theU.S.S.R., China and France to be permanent members of the Security Council,and for six non-permanent members, three to be elected in alternate years for two-year terms.   The total membership is thus eleven.3. All the Dominions are prepared to recognise the special position of thefive permanent members. The issue is : Are all members of the Organisation,other than the five Great Powers, to be equally eligible for the six non-permanentseats ?4. When it comes to counting votes, the membership of the Organisation is relevant. I annex a note on this point, which shows the preponderance whichLatin American countries are likely to be able to exert.5. The nominal equality of all members, great and small, is regarded by many as having been one of the defects of the League of Nations, and Canada has consistently claimed that, in elections to the Security Council of the new organisation, provision should be made, between the Great Powers and the smallnations, for a category of &quot; Middle Powers,&quot; whose contribution, both militaryand economic, should entitle them to increased opportunities for representation on the Council.6. During the Dumbarton Oaks discussions, the United Kingdom Delega-tioiif largely in order to meet the views of Canada, pressed for a provision that,in elections to the non-permanent seats &apos;&apos; due regard (should be paid) to the contribution of the members of theOrganisation towards the maintenance of international peace and security and towards the other purposes of the Organisation.&quot;Both the United States and Soviet Delegations, however, objected strongly andthe provision was not included.7. The Canadian Government have made it clear, both in public statements and in their confidential communications, that they propose to raise this matter again. A Canadian memorandum of the 12th January to the principal Powerscontains the following passages : &quot;Under the (Dumbarton Oaks) proposals a country which would becalled upon to make a substantial contribution to world security has no betterassurance of election to the Security Council than the smallest and weakest[29563] B
2State. Furthermore, such a country, when not holding an elected seat on theSecurity Council, would be required to obligate itself to accept and carry outthe decisions of the Council decisions which might entail drastic action onits part under the provisions of paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of Chapter VIII B.Such action might even be required by the Council without any consultationwith the Government of the country in question. In contrast, a Great power is ensured of participating fully in all the deliberations of the security council and is likely also to be assured of exercising a right of individualveto on many of its decisions.&quot; It is open to question whether a country such as Canada could under-take to accept such an obligation or could, if the obligation were to be initiallyaccepted, ensure effective collaboration in the indefinite future. Canadacertainly makes no claim to be regarded as a Great Power. The Canadianrecord in two great wars, however, has revealed both readiness to join inconcerted action against aggression and the possession of substantial militaryand industrial capacity. There are a number of other States the potentialcontribution of which to the maintenance of future security is of the same order of magnitude. The support of these States is important to the main-tenance of peace, and the active collaboration of some at least of them wouldprobably be required for the execution of major decisions of the security council under Chapter VIII B of the proposals.&quot; The question therefore arises whether it is possible, within the frame-work of the general scheme, to devise means of associating more effectively with the work of the Security Council States of the order of internationalimportance of Canada. This might be achieved by making some changesin the powers conferred on the Council, and by ensuring that such states were chosen to fill elected seats on the Council more frequently (or possiblyfor longer periods) than States with less to contribute to the maintenance of security.&quot;8.   General Smuts has commented as follows :  &quot; This new category will raise much heartburning and may prove evenmore troublesome than the unanimity question. There will be violent gate-crashing for this seconcl-class group. In the League of Nations there was much trouble over similar issues, and it will be remembered how Brazil pre-vented the election of Germany to a permanent seat on the Council, and thiscreated a situation with far-reaching after-consequences. The questionwhich Canada raises should be settled by the good sense of the world organisation in actual practice without attempting to create a favouredclass of secondary Powers. Questions of status are usually more difficult to solve than the more important ones of policy.&quot;9. Australia and New Zealand have so far expressed no views either wayon this point, but, if a special class of States were created, Australia would almost certainly wish to be in it.10. Prolonged consideration of the problem in the Dominions Office andForeign Office has led to the conclusion that no solution can be devised which islikely to be entirely satisfactory to the United Kingdom, as a Great Power, to canada, Australia and India as important secondary States, and to New zealand and South Africa as small secondary States.11. A solution which has been recommended by officials is that a short listof &quot; middle &quot; Powers should be drawn up, and that it should be provided, formallyor informally, that of the six non-permanent members of the Council, four shouldbe elected from this list, i.e., two at each election. The short list (Category A)tentatively suggested is :- Australia.Belgium.Brazil.Canada.India.Mexico.NetherlandsPoland or Ukraine.12. It is suggested that, of the remaining two seats, one should be allocated to the Latin American countries other than those in Category A (Category B) and
one to the approximately equal number of the remaining members of the Organisa-tion (Category C) including New Zealand and South Africa. We should inpractice hope to ensure that there would always be at least one member of theCommonwealth on the Security Council from either Category A or Category C.13. This solution has been put forward on the assumption that we couldnot secure United States and Soviet consent to an increase in the total member-ship of the Security Council, even if this were desirable in United kingdom interests.14. I confess that I do not like any solution which differentiates, as thiswould do, between some British Commonwealth countries and others for thepurpose of membership of the Security Council. If, however, a discussion atthe London meeting shows that all Delegations consider that some provision forthe representation of middle Powers ought to be proposed at San Francisco, Ishould like to be authorised to suggest this solution to them. Whether weeventually propose anything on these lines at San Francisco would depend onits reception at the London meeting.(b) Obligations of Members of the Organisation.15. Chapter VIII B of the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals recommends thatthe Security Council should be empowered to determine what measures not involving-ing the use of armed force should be employed to give effect to its decisions and tocall upon members of the Organisation to apply such measures. These may includealmost everything short of the application of armed force. It is recommended that members of the Organisation should undertake to make available armed forces onthe call of the Security Council and in accordance with agreements for thispurpose.   The Canadian Government have commented as follows :  &quot;It is suggested that decisions of the Security Council under chapter VIII B should be made binding in the first instance only on states which are members of the Council. States not represented on the council should be required to take &quot;positive action only when the decision has been endorsed by a two-thirds majority of the Assembly (when it would becomebinding on all members), or when the country or countries concerned haveby special invitation participated on the same footing as elected members in the Council&apos;s proceedings, or when they have individually agreed withthe Council to join in a particular task of enforcement. The adoption ofthese suggestions would make it far easier for States other than the great powers to enter into agreements making available to the organisation sub-stantial military forces, facilities and assistance, and would thus increasethe effective power at the disposal of the Council. Their adoption wouldalso help to secure the requisite public support in countries not permanentlyrepresented on the Council.&quot;This point has also been made publicly by the Canadian Government.Amendment of the proposals in the sense of the Canadian criticism would cut at the root of the whole idea of giving the new Organisation &quot; teeth &quot; andI consider that we should take our stand on the Dumbarton Oaks Proposals intheir present form. If the Canadian Government receive some satisfaction withregard to their proposals for the constitution of a category of &quot; Middle Powers &quot;on the Security Council, this would give Canada a good chance of a seat onthe Council, and they are less Likely to press us on their second point.&apos;   C.Dominions Office,%\st March, 1945.

There are also some special or doubtful cases.Iceland was offered the opportunity of qualifying for an invitation by declaring war on the Axis, but decided not to clo so. It is uncertain whether the Argentineor Poland will be represented. The United States may, as reported, ask for twoextra votes. The Conference is to decide whether White Russia and the Ukraineare to be admitted.For the purposes of the following calculations. Iceland, the Argentine and poland have been omitted, and the United States and Soviet Union have beencounted in with one vote each.II. A nalysis.1. (i) Of the 46 States present, 19 will be recruited from Latin America.In other words 19 Latin American States will command 41 per cent, of the votesin the General Assembly. The 19 Latin American States plus the United states will command 4-3 per cent, of the votes.(ii) Europe, excluding the Soviet Union, but including the United Kingdom,contains 23 States. Of these only 9 will be represented at San Francisco.Europe, as opposed to the 43 per cent, possessed by Latin America and the UnitedStates, will have only 19 per cent, of the voting power in the Assembly.(iii) In the Middle East 8 States (Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi-Arabia, Persia, Syria and Turkey) will have 17 per cent, of the votes in theAssembly.(iv) In the rest of A sia there are only two States which could possibly qualify(China and India) and both of these will be present. They will cast 4 per cent.of the votes.
