THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S S-QYERNMBMTQ printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 219.5th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES FOR LIBERATED AREAS IN EUROPE.Memorandum by the Deputy Prime Minister.AT their meeting on the 12th March (W.M. (45) 29th Conclusions, Minute 3),the War Cabinet invited me to review the position as regards Supplies for liberated Areas. With the Prime Minister^ approval the Ad Hoc ministerial committee, appointed by the War Cabinet on the 15th January, 1945 (W.M. (45)6th-Conclusions, Minute 8), was reconvened for this purpose.I now circulate the Report of the Committee for the information of the WarCabinet. The action we have taken, or the recommendations we wish to make,are set out in paragraph 4, and our general conclusions in paragraph 5. of the privy Council Office, S.WA,5th April, 1945.REPORT OF AD HOC MINISTERIAL COMMITTEE.In examining the question of supplies for liberated areas as desired by theWar Cabinet at their meeting on the 12th March, 1945, we have had before us,in addition to a report of a Working Party of Officials (i) The  recommendations  contained   in  the  Lord  Presidents  Report(W.P. (45) 171) of the 15th March on Supplies to Liberated Areas.(ii) W.P. (45) 154 Dr. Gerbrandy&apos;s letter to the Prime Minister.(iii) W.P. (45) 159 -memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs on France : Supply Questions.(iv) W.P. (45) 134 joint memorandum by the Minister of Production, theMinister of War Transport and the Minister of State on theTransport Situation in France,(v) We have also discussed in its general aspects the question of feedingGermany.2. Since we were appointed to conduct this review the situation has beenmaterially changed by the decision to send a Ministerial delegation to washington to discuss outstanding questions in connection with food supplies. In view of thatdecision, we have thought it unnecssary to deal with questions such as the size of the United Kingdom food stocks, the United Kingdom Import Programme, &amp;c,in their relation to supplies for liberated areas, for these are matters which will now fall to be handled in the discussions to take place in the United States.3. Our review of the position generally has inevitably meant much discussionof points which, however important, are primarily matters of detail, and withwhich we think it unnecessary to trouble the War Cabinet. We record below,however, the action which we have taken or which we recommend in respect of anumber of individual issues of greater importance and which we think should bebrought to the notice of our colleagues.[29605]Report.C. R. A.,Chairman(for the Committee).
2Individual Issues.(i) Replenishment of S.H.A.E.F. Stockpiles in the United Kingdom and on theContinent.4. A deficit of 29,000 tons in S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s stockpiles, consequent on thesupply of food from them to Belgium, is still to be filled, and cannot be met fromthe&apos;United Kingdom. We have invited the Minister of Production and theMinister of Food to take this matter up in Washington. . As regards the Hollandstockpiles in particular, that in the United Kingdom, from which 23,000 tons ofsupplies had been taken for Belgium, is being replenished, save for an item of6,000 tons of meat, At our request, the Minister of Food has undertaken to do his best to find this, although he has pointed out to us that the extent to whichhe can hope to do so must be dependent upon his discussions in the United States.The Holland stockpile on the Continent will be fully replenished by the7th April.(ii) Shipping of Edible Oil to Antwerp for Processing.We have invited the Minister of Food and the Minister of War transport to pursue further with the Secretary of State for War the provision and shipping of edible oil to Antwerp with a view to its being processed in Belgium.(iii) Allocation and Procurement of S.H.A.E.F. Civil Affairs Requirements.We are impressed by the importance of reaching a satisfactory understandingin regard to the allocation and procurement of S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s Civil Affairsrequirements, and we have invited the Minister of Production and the Ministerof Food to endeavour to secure this in the forthcoming discussions.(iv) Diversion of Supplies to Germany from Liberated Areas.Civil Affairs supplies allocated to S.C.A.E.F. are at present allocated for thegeneral aise of the areas within his responsibility and are not sub-divided by countries. There are operational reasons of great weight for this arrangement,for S.C.A.E.F. must clearly be free to use supplies available to the best advantageof the operational situation, and we do not suggest that there should be anychange of procedure. At the same time, there is a risk that supplies may, asthe advance into Germany goes deeper, be diverted from the liberated areas of north-West Europe to the advantage of Germany and the disadvantage of our allies. While the final discretion and decision must rest with S.C.A.E.F. wehave invited the Minister of Production and the Minister of Food to attempt toreach an agreement with the Americans that no food-stuffs in short supplyprocured to meet the requirements of the Western Allies shall be diverted toGermany.(v) The  Ycdta Basic  Undertakings regarding the Provision of Supplies toLiberated Europe.The basic undertakings agreed at Yalta included the provision of such supplies to liberated Europe as effectively contribute to the war-making capacityof the United Nations. Pressure of operational demands as interpreted bythe United States Chiefs of Staff has so far resulted in little advantage accruing to the liberated areas from this agreement, We consider that there would bedanger in endeavouring to reopen or widen this controversial question, but we feel that the provisions of the undertaking should be used to the full in pressing for the requirements of the Government Import Programmes through the normalCombined Board machinery.(vi) Problems presented by Occupied Holland on Liberation.We are greatly concerned at the magnitude and acuteness of the problem which will arise on the liberation of occupied Holland, and by the scale of medical and welfare assistance which will be necessary. We have invited the Secretaryof State for War to discuss with the Minister of Health the possibility of usingmedical students under training in the hospitals for a short visit to occupiedHolland on liberation in this connection; and to consider also whether assistanceof value might not be obtained from the Red Cross. We think in the sameconnection that there would be value in establishing a rear-link in London, whowould be responsible for examining all possibilities and the mobilising of any assistance for relieving Holland, and would act as a rear-link for GeneralGalloway. The Secretary of State for War has undertaken to examine thismatter.
(vii) Discussions between the Lord President and the Chiefs of Staff regardingRelief for Occupied, Holland.The Lord President informs us that he has, as desired by the War cabinet at their meeting on the 12th March, consulted with the Chiefs of Staff on the preparations to be made to bring relief to the civil population in occupied Hollandon its liberation and that S.C.A.E.F. will be submitting a plan for the liberationand relief of that country.(viii) Dr. Gerbrundy&apos;s Letter to the Prime Minister (W.P. (45) 154).We have taken note of Dr. Gerbrandy&apos;s letter to the Prime Minister(W.P. (45) 154) and understand the Combined Chiefs of Staff are in consultationwith S.C.A.E.F. on these matters. It is important that food and medical supplies should be ready if and when any plan resulting from this consultation is to beput into action, and we are satisfied that that point is prominently before those concerned.(ix) Sup-ply Questions: France (W.P. (45) 159).We have taken note of the Minister of State&apos;s memorandum (W.P. (45) 159)on Supply Questions for France. The position is still substantially as thereindescribed, and we have no comment to offer.(x) Transport Situation in France (W.P. (45) 134).We have also taken note of the memorandum by the Minister of Production,the Minister of War Transport and the Minister of State (W.P. (45) 134) on thetransport situation in France. There have been a variety of changes in&apos;theposition since that memorandum was prepared, but they are all in respect of matters of detail and we think it unnecessary to trouble the War Cabinet about them.(xi) Feeding of Germany.On the question of feeding Germany (a) We note that a substantial amount of the food requirements put forward by S.C.A.E.F. for Germany is designed not for the feeding of Germans(for which purpose only wheat is being demanded) but for the feedingof displaced persons in that country.(b) As regards the future, it will be necessary, in our view, both for opera-tional reasons (in the interests of preventing unrest) and to the extent that we may wish to use German labour for coal-mining and other forms of production on behalf of the Allies, to contemplate makinga certain amount of food available for the feeding of Germans. while accepting the necessity for this, we regard it as of the first importance that a situation should not arise in which Germany, as an occupiedenemy country, should be in receipt of treatment more generous inrespect of food supplies than the liberated countries of North-west europe.General Conclusions.5.   Our general conclusions are as follows :  (1) The area of crucial importance is Occupied Holland. All possible painsshould be taken to ensure that we are ready to deal effectively withthat problem in terms of supplies and of rehabilitation equipment themoment that our occupation takes place. A grave situation may alsodevelop in liberated areas of North-West Europe if the supplies askedfor by S.H.A.E.F. and the National Governments do not arrive in fulland up to time. The extent to which this country can help either bysupplies of food or by supplies of equipment is, however, inevitablyextremely limited.(2) We are satisfied that, so far as this country is concerned, relevant action is in hand, and that there is a full sense of the gravity and difficultyof the problems that lie ahead.
(3) The real answer to most of these problems lies with the United States.Unless the United States are prepared to make food supplies availableto the extent that they cannot be found from here or from the colonial dependencies of the countries concerned, and again to the extent thatthere may be any failure to deliver food supplies promised to the scheduled dates, there is the risk of a most grave situation developing,politically, economically and operationally. These are matters that are bound to bulk large in the forthcoming discussions in Washington.(Initialled) C. It. A., Chairman(for the Committee^
