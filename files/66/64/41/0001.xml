THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.w.P. (45) 241.12th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.PAPER FOR A GENERAL ELECTION.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE Prime Minister has suggested that the annexed report on the provisionof paper for a general election, which was prepared at the request of the lord presidents Committee (LP. (45) 19th Meeting, Minute 2), should be circulated for consideration by the War Cabinet.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,12th April, 1945.ANNEX.Report by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.In accordance with the Committee&apos;s request (L.P. (45) 19th Meeting,Minute 2), I have discussed with the Home Secretary, the Minister of Education,the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Lord Sherwood (representing theSecretary of State for Air), and with the Chief Agents of the Conservative,Labour, Liberal and Liberal National Parties, the question of the allocations of paper to be made (a) to Party Headquarters and (b) to individual candidates, foruse in the General Election. As a result of this discussion I am now in a positionto submit, for the approval of the Committee, the recommendations set out inthe following paragraphs.2.   I recommend that allocations to Party Headquarters for central purposes should be as follows : Tons.Conservative Party    ... ... ... ... 500Liberal Central Association ... ... ... 500Labour Party   ...       ... ... ... ... 500Liberal National Party ... ... ... 100National Labour Party ... ... ... 15Co-operative Pa rty    ... ... ... ... 60Independent Labour Party ... ... ... 50Communist Party      ... ... ... ... 50Commonwealth Party... ... ... ... 25Total................      1,800As soon as these allocations have been approved and announced, a substantial proportion of the paper allocated should be made available to the PartyHeadquarters. Administrative action should, however, be taken to ensure thatthis does not lead to any interference with the printing of the Electoral Register.3. I propose that the quantity of paper to be allocated to individualcandidates should be 1 ton for each candidate where the electorate is not morethan 40,000, and an additional 5 cwt. for every 10,000 electors above 40,000.Assuming 2,000 candidates and an average electorate of between 40,000 and50,000, this would absorb 2,500 tons of paper.   Each independent candidate should[29678]I   Copy No.x/
receive an additional allocation equivalent to 25 per cent, of his individualallocation calculated on the above basis.The paper allocated for individual candidates (including independentcandidates, whether or not already Members of Parliament) should not be madeavailable until the election has been announced. Thereafter each candidate shouldbe entitled to receive his appropriate allocation against presentation to any papermerchant of a certificate signed by his Agent.4. I suggest that candidates presenting themselves as Scottish or WelshNationalists should be treated, for the purposes of allocations of paper, as independent candidates. On this basis they would receive additional individualallocations on the lines proposed in the preceding paragraph; and, if a claimwere made either by the Scottish Nationalists or by the Welsh Nationalists foran allocation for central pmaposes, they might perhaps be told that it was opento them to pool their additional individual allocations and use them for such purposes.5. The Chief Agents of the four main parties have assured me that it isclearly understood by them (a) that quotas allocated to individual candidates willnot be transferable; and (b) that both Party Headquarters and individualcandidates will restrict their acquisitions of paper for use in the election to the quotas to be made available to them in accordance with the approved allocations.(Party Headquarters will, however, continue to receive their regular allocation of paper for general purposes, which is based on a specified proportion of, thepaper used by them for such purposes before the war.)6. The recommendations set out in this memorandum do not in every casefully meet the views of the four main parties. My colleagues have, however, been good enough to say that they are prepared to accept them.7. The Committee will no doubt wish to consider whether there should bea proportionate cut in all the allocations which I have suggested on the ground of the general shortage of paper. It will be observed, however, that the effect ofthe recommendation set out in paragraph 2 above is to reduce to 1,800 tons thetotal amount of paper to be allocated for central purposes; and the general viewof my colleagues is that the allocations which I have proposed represent theminimum necessary to ensure an adequate presentation to the country of the issues which will be involved in the election.J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,5th April, 1945.
