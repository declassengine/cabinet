Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 225.9th April, 1945. iVWAR CABINET.WAR CRIMINALS.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT has sent over to this country a personal repre-sentative, Judge Rosenman (a Judge of the Appeal Court of New York State,specially authorised by the American Secretary of State, and a close adviser of president Roosevelt), together with General Weir (Head of the War Crimessection of the Judge Advocate-General&apos;s Department), and Colonel Cutter (fromthe Office of the Assistant Secretary of War), to discuss and, if possible, to reach agreement with us as to the methods to be adopted in dealing with war criminals.In view of the high authority which the American delegation possess (JudgeRosenman told me that if he was able to take back heads of agreement he was confident that on his recommendation the President would accept them), it is mostimportant to make the most of this opportunity. I was asked to undertake thediscussion with the American delegation, and as the result of a conference (inwhich our side included the Attorney-General, General Gurney, representing theWar Office, Sir William Malkin and Mr. Dean representing the Foreign Office, andSir Thomas Barnes, the Treasury Solicitor) we arrived at certain agreed conclusions. If these conclusions were ratified by the War Cabinet and thePresident, a most important advance will have been made in a matter which is becoming of increasing urgency. The American Senate is raising all sorts of questions about war criminals; Parliament, and especially the House of Lords, is anxious to be assured that things are really in train. The American delegation and ourselves are in complete agreement that nothing of these more detailed plansmust be made public until the time is reached, when British and A mericanpersonnel who are now prisoners in German hands are safe. The urgency, there-fore, is not to make an immediate public statement, but to have the points settled,ready for argeed action. I do not myself think that it is worth delaying in orderto bring into consultation the Russians or indeed the French. The former, imagine, will go their own way about war criminals as they have done hitherto.As to the latter, I hardly think that disclosure would be consistent with keeping the whole matter really secret.2. In the following Appendix are set out the points discussed and largelyprovisionally agreed between the American delegation and the British committeeover which I presided. The Attorney-General and I most strongly urge that authority should be given to tell Judge Rosenman within the next few days thatwe are in line with the Americans on these points.S.House of Lords, S.W. 1,9th April, 1945.[29620]
APPENDIX.Points discussed (and in large part provisionally agreed) with Judge Rosenmansubject, to ratification by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the AmericanGovernment.1, The American delegation is in complete agreement with our view thatthe plan forwarded by the War Crimes Commission for a treaty under which an inter-Allied criminal court should be specially created for the trial of war criminals should be rejected. Judge Rosenman pointed out that the treaty wouldhave to come before the American Senate, and he regarded this scheme asimpracticable. The arguments, indeed, are quite overwhelmingly against it the treaty would need to be negotiated clause by clause between all the Allies, and,even if that could be done with reasonable promptitude, there would remainimmensely difficult questions, such as the selection of the individual judges, therules of procedure, and other matters. This proposal, so far as the americans and ourselves are concerned, may be regarded as dead and buried, though JudgeRosenman prudently pointed out that it followed that we must be prepared to putforward at the proper time some alternative.2. The American delegation and we ourselves are also in agreement that(apart from the cases that are dealt with under the Moscow Declaration byreferring the war criminals to the country which has suffered to deal with themby its own courts) the right kind of tribunal is a military tribunal. If the warcrime has been committed against members of our own forces alone, JudgeRosenman saw no objection to the trial of such a war criminal by a british military court. I told him that we had, in fact, already drawn up a draft royal warrant which would enable a British military court to exercise its jurisdiction in such cases. The same, of course, applies to other war criminals whose offenceis at the expense of the forces of some other Ally, but there will be many cases inwhich the&quot; same war criminal is answerable for war crimes committed againstmembers of the forces of more Allies than one, and nere the natural course wouldbe to have the case dealt with by a mixed military court. We are in agreement that there is likely to be a fairly large range of cases in which mixed militarytribunals will be the most appropriate court. If the general principles of thisparagraph are affirmed, there ought to be no difficulty in arranging the technicaldetails. General AVeir points out that, if a mixed military tribunal is given authority by the Supreme Allied Military Authority, this may result in avoiding a great deal of technicality. The consent of the American Senate would not be needed.3. Judge Rosenman pointed out that there are really three classes of war criminals to be provided for, and not only two. There are the two classes referredto in the Moscow Declaration, at the two ends of the scale. The arch-criminals(Hitler, Mussolini, ITimmler, Goring, Goebbels, Ribbentrop, &amp;c), are, accordingto the Moscow Declaration, to be dealt with as the Allies shall decide. At theother end, there are the ordinary war criminals who can be proved by evidence to have been personally guilty of war crimes either as perpetrators or asinstigators. But there is a very large intermediate class not covered by either ofthe above descriptions, viz., leaders and active members in the Gestapo or in theS.S. The proposal put forward by the Judge would cover this intermediate class.The method suggested would be somewhat as follows : Some of the leaders orprominent figures in the Gestapo and in the S.S. would be brought before a mixedmilitary tribunal charged with any crime that could be proved against thempersonally, but at the same time it would be alleged, and the court would be askedto find as a fact, that members of the Gestapo and of the S.S. were members ofa common enterprise of a criminal character aiming at promoting a Germanvictory by methods of outrage, torture, wholesale eviction and deportation,starvation, and so forth. The American view is that, if the mixed militarytribunal, after having had put before it sufficient material to justify theconclusion, found as a fact that these associations were of themselves of a criminalcharacter, they could pronounce a judgment to that effect. Having done this, itwould be possible to take other Germans who were members of the Gestapo or ofthe S.S. and charge them with being members of the criminal conspiracy andpunish them accordingly not necessarily by a death sentence, but by suitablepenal action. They might be sentenced, for example, to remove land mines andbombs in territory formerly occupied by the Germans, &amp;c.
It would be open to a member of the Gestapo to prove that he did not join the organisation voluntarily but was forced to do so (though, in fact, the membersof the Gestapo were, I believe, volunteers), or to prove that his individualactivities were entirely harmless. But it would not be open to him to deny thathe had joined an organisation engaged in a criminal enterprise which, even beforethe war, was active with violence and recklessness against those who opposed the nazis, and consequently he could be properly found guilty as a participant if he did not exculpate himself as above. It is an advantage of this method of treatmentthat no question as to whether the offence is technically a &apos;&apos; war crime &apos;&apos; arises,though the fact that the preliminary organisation was being made ready and available if war came is, of course, material.The Attorney-General and I think that this plan for dealing with capturedmen of the Gestapo and the S.S. has great merits, and we would hope that the WarCabinet would approve it.4. I set before the American Delegation a plan for dealing with the arch-criminals, which I favour and which was worked out before the Crimea conference in case the subject then came up for further discussion. JudgeRosenman was emphatic that Mr. Stimson was entirely opposed to the idea ofpunishing these arch-criminals without any judicial enquiry. I am myselfsatisfied that agreement could not be obtained between the Big Three to shootthem out of hand. On the other hand, there are the gravest objections to puttingupon a judicial tribunal the decision of what the punishment should be : that, atany rate, must be for the main Allied Governments to determine. It is a politicaldecision of immense importance, for it may have a profound influence on the futurehistory of the world. The plan I put before Judge Rosenman, therefore, was intended to provide an adequate judicial enquiry into the truth of the broad facts which would justify the Allies in inflicting the severest punishment.The plan, in outline, is as follows : The principal Allies should draw up a &quot; Document of Arraignment insomewhat general terms, and an Inter-Allied judicial tribunal (which might,however, include some members who were not professionally judges) should beappointed to report upon the truth of this Arraignment after Hitler and Co. havehave been given an opportunity of coming before the tribunal and disprovingthe truth of its contents, if they&apos;could. The Arraignment would allege that thesemen are jointly responsible for a plan to establish Nazi domination over the worldby methods which disregarded the laws of war and which involved not onlyunjustified aggression in breach of treaties, but the deliberate employment ofsavagery, torture and extermination. It would include the charge that they had set out to maltreat and destroy the Jews. The Arraignment would be supportedby adequate documentation. This Arraignment would be served on Hitler (totake him as an example and supposing he is captured), and he would be told thathe would be brought before an inter-Allied tribunal and be given the opportunityof disproving these allegations, if he could. The charges, of course, which shouldbe in general language rather than a catalogue of particular instances, wouldbe so drawn as to be beyond historical disproof and would represent the real case which the whole world recognises lies against Hitler. If he refuses to recognise the jurisdiction of the tribunal, the tribunal would report that this is his answer,and extreme measures could be taken with the justification that judicial investiga-tion had been offered him. If, on the other hand, he seeks to defend himself,the worst that could happen would be that he would make a long speech andpossibly call some witnesses; but the documentary material and the summarisedhistory of the last few years could not be gainsaid, and the tribunal, actingjudicially, would report the conclusion. One great advantage of this plan wouldhe that while it meets the qualms of those who think that even Hitler should notbe shot without trial, it avoids the interminable and endless dispute which wouldresult from following the ordinary procedure. The Arraignment would not bemerely for &quot; war crimes,&quot; but would cover the planned wickedness perpetratedbefore the war, e.g., in the cruelties inflicted on the Jewish population.5. It would be a most important step forward if the War Cabinet felt ableto give its approval to this plan. Judge Roseman described it as &quot; novel,ingenious and sound in principle,&quot; and he spoke hopefully of gettingMr. Stimson&apos;s concurrence.Mr. McCloy, who is, I believe, Under-Secretary in the War Department ofthe United States, is expected to arrive here on Wednesday, the 11th April, andwill, I understand, be taking part in further discussions between us on this
subject. I feel that if the War Cabinet would approve the American plansummarised in paragraph 3 above, and also the plan in paragraph 4 for dealingwith the arch-criminals, there is a good prospect of reaching an agreement betweenAmerica and ourselves which would be of the greatest value. I would repeat that neither the American Delegation nor we ourselves contemplate that anythingshould be made public about this detailed plan until British and Americanprisoners who are now prisoners in Germany are safe. But there is much to be gained by establishing agreement between Washington and London now. Itwould remain for consideration how and when Soviet Russia and France shouldbe asked to join in such an agreement.
