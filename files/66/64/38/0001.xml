(45) 238.llth April, 1945.WAR CABINET.153ARRANGEMENTS   FOR  Mr.   ANDREW   ROTHSTEIN   TO   GO   to belgium AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TASS AGENCY.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor War.THE War Cabinet, at their meeting on the 19th March (W.M. (45)33rd Conclusions), invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forWar to consider and report to the War Cabinet what arrangements could bemade for Mr. Rothstein to proceed to Belgium as the representative of the TassAgency consistently with the decision that the Daily Worker should not beallowed to have accredited correspondents with His Majesty&apos;s forces.At the same meeting of the War Cabinet it was decided to maintain thedecision that the Daily Worker should not be allowed to have a representativeaccredited to the forces, even if the Daily Worker were prepared to appoint ajournalist who was not a member of the Communist Party and was under no obligation to disclose to the management of the newspaper information conveyed to him in confidence in the course of his duties as a war correspondent.2. There is no likelihood that the Daily Worker would choose as their representative a man who was out of sympathy with the policy and methods ofthe Communist Party, and the reason for refusing to accredit with the Armiesa representative of the Daily Worker is that no such person can be trusted notto follow the Communist practice of placing loyalty to the Party above all otherloyalties and that any person chosen by the Daily Worker, if given confidential information, is likely to communicate such information to the Party, with theresult that information which ought to be kept confidential will be spread in sucha way that there is a risk of dangerous leakage.3. The fact, however, that a member of the British Communist Party, ora representative chosen by the Daily Worker, whether he is admittedly a memberof the Communist Party or not, cannot be trusted with confidential information,is not a sufficient reason for refusing the Tass Agency (or the Daily Worker ifthey ask for it) permission to send a civilian representative to Brussels provided this civilian representative is placed- in a similar position to that of newspaperrepresentatives in Paris who are not accredited to the Armies and not given access to confidential information.4. There would therefore be no objection to allowing Mr. Rothstein toproceed to Belgium as the civilian representative of the Tass Agency under thearrangements to which General Bedell Smith is prepared to agree, as outlined in W.P. (45) 155.If the Daily Worker should ask to be allowed to send a civilian correspondentto Brussels under similar arrangements, there would be no objection to grantingthis request.[29669]
5. It was, however, suggested in the War Cabinet 33rd Conclusions of the19th March that Mr. Rothstein, if allowed to proceed to Belgium as therepresentative of the Tass Agency, should be accorded better facilities forthe transmission of messages than would be available under these arrangements.The question what arrangements can be made for the transmission ofmessages is quite independent of any security considerations. The point ofprinciple to which the Home Secretary attaches importance is that neitherMr. Rothstein, who is a member of the British Communist Party, nor anyrepresentative whom the Daily Worker may send to Belgium, shall be givenfacilities to have access to confidential information. The maintenance of this principle will not be affected by any arrangement which may prove practical forgiving Mr. Rothstein special facilities for the transmission of messages. As,however, civilian correspondents are now using civilian communications and as these have been found adequate, we do not think the question of communicationspresents any difficulty.H. M.P. J. G.Whitehall, S.W. 1,11th April, 1945.
