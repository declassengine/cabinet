Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.-^-secret. Copy No.   22W.P. (45) 203.2%th March, 1945.WAR CABINET.V-WEAPON SITES IN NORTHERN FRANCE.Memoeandum by the Minister of Information.I put forward the suggestion that the substance of the facts contained inthe &quot;Report on &apos; Large &apos; Crossbow sites in Northern France,&quot; CCS. (45) 177 (O),should be made public at once.2. It is not only that these facts are a fascinating story in themselves andthey would round off with official authority a good deal of more or less inaccurateinformation about the existence and purpose of these sites that has leaked out to the public in the past. They do also bring home in a vivid way the narrownessof our escape even as recently as 1944 from great disasters at the hands of theGermans and the magnitude and determination of the plans that were levelledagainst us. I have no doubt that they contain, too, some lessons as to the require-ments of our future security which will not pass altogether unnoticed.3. I propose therefore that the Air Ministry be asked in consultation withthe Ministry of Information to arrange for publicity to be given to the substance of this report, including some of the striking illustrations.B. B.Ministry of Information, W.C. 1,2$th March, 1945.[29544]
