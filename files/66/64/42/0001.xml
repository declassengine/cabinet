THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   A pril 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 242.12th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.COMPULSORY MILITARY SERVICE.Report by the Armistice and Post-War Committee.FOLLOWING upon the conclusion of the War Cabinet* that the continuanceafter the war of some form of compulsory military service should be examined by a Cabinet Committee, the Prime Minister referred to the Armistice and Post-War Committee the following terms of reference : &quot; To report whether some form of compulsory military service in the armed Forces of the Crown should be continued after the war. In itsexamination the Committee is asked to take into account the size of ourpost-war forces so far as that can be foreseen; the resultant man-power requirements and the political factors involved.&quot;2. It would clearly have been desirable for the starting-point of our examination to have been a comprehensive review of the post-war defence problemof the British Empire, from which could be deduced the size of the forces to bemaintained by the United Kingdom, both for the fulfilment of its obligations under the World Organisation and for its essential security tasks in different parts of the world. It is clear to us, however, that no such comprehensive reviewis possible at the present time. The general situation is too uncertain, and probable developments in the next two or three years are too unpredictable, forfirm conclusions to be reached. We therefore have had to take a less satisfactorystarting-point for our enquiry. We called for papers to be furnished on thefollowing basis : (a) From the Service Ministers to show what will be the man-power require-ments of the minimum forces which will have to be maintained under any reasonable hypothesis; and to show whether these requirementscan be satisfactorily met without conscription (vide A.P.W. (45)4, 9 and 20).(b) From- the Foreign Secretary to show the bearing of the problem of conscription on our foreign policy (vide A.P.W. (45) 8).(c) From the Minister of Labour to indicate the probable supply of man-power available under voluntary and compulsory systems (videA.P.W. (45) 22).3.   The following summarises the views expressed in the above papers : A. Admiralty.The Admiralty would not expect difficulty in continuing to man the Fleeton a purely voluntary basis. Compulsory military service would nevertheless be of value to the Navy for the provision of reserves, and if on other grounds ascheme of compulsory military service proves desirable they would wish toparticipate. They estimate their annual intake in post-war years at 35,000 menas conscripts in addition to volunteer entries for regular engagements. this number will need to be reviewed when the full magnitude of the Naval share ofthe ultimate defence scheme of the Empire is known.* W.M. (44) 141st Conclusions, Minute 6.[29666]
B. War Office.The War Office regard compulsory military service as essential if the army is to fulfil its minimum commitments after the war. They foresee the necessityfor a Regular Army of 275,000 plus an annual intake of at least 156,000conscripts. On this basis, and assuming one year&apos;s conscription, the totalembodied army would number 408.000 at any one moment, distributed somewhatas follows : Imperial garrisons, &amp;c..........        62,000 (46,000 in India)2 Divisions in Middle East and a cadrefor African Colonial Forces ...       ...        57,0004 Divisions with Rearward Units ...       102,000A.A. and Coast Defence Units ...        15,000Cadres, base installations, Schools, Train -ing Organisations, &amp;c.        ...       ...       172,000Total       ............      408,000It hardly seems possible that under any hypothesis we could afford to maintainsmaller military forces than these.C. Air Ministry.The Air Ministry calculate that the annual intake required for their regularforce and reserve will be of the order of 70-80,000. The Royal Air Force wouldbe composed of the regular R.A.F., the Auxiliary Air Force forming part ofthe front line of the Home Defence Force, and a general reserve of air and groundpersonnel. The retention of national service will be essential if an adequate force with these three elements is to be maintained.All three services strongly emphasise that they must continue to depend toa large extent upon the voluntary system, and that any scheme which is evolvedshould take full account of that fact.Although it is not clear that the three Service Departments have made theircalculations on exactly similar lines, these figures offer a broad indication of theentries required. Assuming that the War Cabinet adopt the recommendation contained in this paper, it will be necessary in due course to review the Depart-mental estimates in the light of later information about the ultimate defence scheme of the Empire to ensure that the share allotted to each Service reflects the responsibilities falling upon it.D. Foreign Office.The Foreign Office regard it as of the utmost importance from the point ofview of our foreign policy that we should maintain compulsory military service.Without conscription they argue that we shall neither possess, nor seem to possess,the means for carrying out our commitments. The apparent lack of determina-tion which an abandonment of conscription would display would have the samebaneful results as it had in the period between the two wars when our seemingweakness not only encouraged our enemies, but discouraged our friends, whofelt grave doubts of our power to support them in any resistance to aggression.E. -Ministry of Labour and National Service.The Ministry of Labour calculate that we might expect a flow of about 65,000volunteers each year for long-term service, of whom about 20,000 would be withinthe conscription age. Assuming that compulsory military service applied to everyone, the annual flow of conscripts would be about 260,000. The latter figure would be sufficient to meet the numbers for the three Services as set out above, thepercentage intakes being somewhat as follows :  Royal Navy    ............... 13 per cent.Army.................. 60 per cent.Royal Air Force       ............ 27 per cent.
4. The Committee have considered these papers, and while there are manydetailed aspects of the problem which require further examination, they feel thatthere is enough material in them to make it possible to come to a conclusion inprinciple. The evidence all points to the conclusion that, at any rate for a con-siderable period after the war, while the times are still troubled, we shall be unable to play our part in the settlement of the world, or protect our vital interests,if we do not maintain compulsory military service. The number of recruits likelyto be forthcoming under a purely voluntary system would fall far short of any reasonable assessment of the man-power requirements of the three Services.5. There are certain other considerations which we have taken into account.It will clearly be necessary to maintain the present National Service systemuntil the end of the Japanese war. Even after the defeat of Japan we shall haveto maintain large forces for a long period for occupation duties both in europe and the Far East. It is not yet possible to foretell when things will have settleddown sufficiently for us to revert to a purely peacetime condition in the armed forces. It is thus unlikely that a decision against conscription could in any casebecome operative for a number of years. On the other hand, there would be considerable advantage if an announcement were made at the present time to theeffect that His Majesty&apos;s Government were fully determined to maintain armed forces on a sufficient scale to enable them to fulfil their commitments in the inter-national field after the defeat of Germany and Japan, and that there was no intention of abandoning compulsory military service. Such an announcement would be valuable in the field of foreign affairs as it would indicate clearly to theworld that we were not going to throw away, as we did last time, all power to make our voice heard. It would encourage the smaller Allies to continue to place theirtrust in us, and although we should obviously not be able to compete in the scale of armaments with America and the U.S.S.R., we should make it clear that wewere ready to take our part in keeping Germany and Japan in subjection, andin any other tasks required of us in support of the World Organisation, or in defence of our vital interests.6. There are strong reasons for taking and announcing a decision inprinciple in the very near future. Unless this is done the service authoritiescannot plan the shape of the forces to be maintained post-war. The educational and industrial authorities, too, cannot lay their plans because they are uncertainof the extent to which the youth of the country will be required for militaryservice.7. The Committee are very conscious of the great burden which will be thrown upon the people of this country by the maintenance of forces even on thescale foreshadowed in the papers by the Service Ministers, which they regard ascomparatively modest. The cost will undoubtedly be heavy and this aspect hasnot yet been examined. There is a very real possibility that the burden may provetoo heavy for us to bear. The only way of reducing the commitments we shall beasked to undertake is to seek, through the medium of a world organisation, theassistance of other nations in those areas of the world where up to the presentpeace and security have been maintained almost exclusively by the UnitedKingdom. For example, it has always been assumed in the past that since thesecurity and freedom from, unrest of the Middle East is a vital interest of theBritish Empire, its maintenance should be an entirely British concern. Theburden of this assumption in terms of man-power and money is very heavy,especially in view of our acute foreign exchange difficulties, and there is much tobe said for an attempt to reduce it by associating the United States in the task.8. The view of the Committee is that though it should be our ultimate aim to reduce the burden of our responsibilities and of the armaments required fortheir fulfilment, by the strongest possible support for international arrangements which will contribute to this end, this should not deter us from a decision tomaintain compulsory military service until the future can be seen more clearly.If this view is supported by the War Cabinet an announcement could be draftedforthwith, and we could then proceed with a full examination of the details ofthe problem and with the working out of a concrete scheme in consultation withthe various interests involved..
