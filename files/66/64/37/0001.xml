3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  April 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 237.13th April, 1945. /war CABINET.CONTROL OF EMPLOYMENT (CIVIL SERVANTS) ORDER.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.BEFORE the War Cabinet reaches a decision on the Chancellor&apos;s proposalsfor the &quot; freezing &quot; of temporary Civil Servants, I should like to draw attentionto the following points.2. It will, I think, be generally agreed that the temporary Civil Servant,at all levels, has done a good job during the war. In my own Ministry 88 per cent,of the staff are temporary Civil Servants and I feel under an obligation to them.I should regret taking a step which might give the impression that their goodservice is being rewarded by any inequity.3. It seems to me difficult to reconcile entirely the principle of the essential work Orders with the proposed, &quot;freezing&quot; Order. My doubts are on three points. Is there any prospect of large-scale redundancy (as Controls disappear)in some sections while the temporary staff as a whole remains &quot; frozen&quot;? Isit right that a section of the community should be prevented by Order, as these officers will be, from exercising their civil rights in the form of political activity ?Will not a sense of grievance be created by the necessity of granting exceptionaltreatment in individual cases?4. On the last point, I myself have in the past given personal assurancesconcerning their release to a number of temporary technical officers, which, as long-as discretion remains with me, I should feel bound to implement. But with a&quot; freezing &quot; Order in force I am advised that it will be quite impossible to fillthese, or other, vacancies without creating further anomalies. The considerablestrain put on the goodwill of those remaining behind will be intensified if, indue course, the less efficient of their number are allowed to depart first.5. The question arises therefore (my own advisers are divided upon the answer) whether a Department such as mine will be more or less efficient if the&quot; freezing &quot; Order is brought into operation at this stage of the war. I suggestthat, to prevent misunderstanding, the Order, if introduced, should apply to permanent and temporary Civil Servants alike; that every care should be takento explain its necessity to those subject to its operation; and that every effort should be made to release as early as possible, with an expression of the Govern-menfs thanks for their service, those temporary officers who do not wish to remain,or whom it is not wished to retain, in the Civil Service.G. Ll. G.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,13th April, 1945.[29668]
