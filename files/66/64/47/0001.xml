Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (45) 247.13th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.RELEASE OE STAFF FOR ELECTORAL REGISTRATION OFFICERSAND RETURNING OFFICERS.IN accordance with the conclusions of the War Cabinet at their meetingon the 26th March (W.M. (45) 36th Conclusions, Minute 4), our departments have endeavoured to ascertain the number of persons now serving with the forces or engaged in industry who belong to the permanent staffs of Registration andReturning Officers and whose services are regarded as essential for the properconduct of the forthcoming General Election. Returns from the registration and Returning Officers are still incomplete because the request for informationcoincided with the holiday period and the staffs of local authorities are at present under heavy pressure of work; but the number of men whose temporary releasehas been applied for is about one hundred and ten (110), of whom about ninetyare in England and Wales. It is estimated that something like a third of this number are serving overseas.2. Having; reerard to the renresentations received on this matter from thelocal authority Associations concerned, the number of applications for releasein England and Wales is likely to be substantially increased when the returns are complete; but it is clear that the total will fall far short of the previousestimate, and that in only a small proportion of the cases will the persons concerned be serving overseas. It is essential, however, if the arrangements foran Election are not to break down, that there shall be an adequate number of experienced persons and the information before us shows that to secure that number will not be possible if the release, of men serving overseas is precluded.The Government has a direct responsibility to see that the official machinerystipulated by lav/ for the conduct of elections shall be effective and we accordinglyask that in cases where the Home Office or Scottish Office is satisfied that therelease of a man serving overseas is required for election purposes, the WarCabinet will give authority for the release of such men subject to overridingoperational objections in individual cases.3. The War Cabinet also asked us to consult with the Chancellor of theExchequer with a view to the release for election work of members of the staffs of Government Departments with the necessary experience. The Treasury haveagreed to impress upon all Departments the importance of allowing CivilServants to volunteer for the routine work connected with the poll and the count,with which they can give valuable help; but such persons cannot take the placeof the staff for whose release we are now asking in making the preparatoryarrangements and in supervising the actual conduct of the Election. For that work experience is essential.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland.H. M.T. J.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 113th April, 1945.[29705]
