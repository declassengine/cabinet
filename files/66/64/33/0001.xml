Printed for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 233.11th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.MIGRATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN January last I circulated, in W.P. (45) 35, two draft agreements on post-War Migration Policy, which had been prepared for submission to theUnited Kingdom and Australian Governments for approval. I have now beeninformed that, subject to one point with which I deal below, the australian government are prepared to accept these draft agreements.It would, I think, be useful to record here the position as regards the otherDominions. In accordance with arrangements made at the Prime Ministers&apos;meeting last May, I invited Dominion Governments to send official representatives to a meeting in London to discuss the matter on a preliminary informal basis. TheCanadian Government declined to be represented at the proposed meeting, on theground that they felt unable at present to reach any conclusions as to the resumption of assisted migration, in particular since plans for the resettlement oftheir own ex-service personnel would have first to be put in hand. The NewZealand Government, though represented at the meeting, were not prepared toagree to any definite plan; their attitude was, in general, similar to that of theCanadian Government. The Government of South Africa made it clear that south Africa&apos;s capacity for the absorption of migrants was in any case limited by the existence of large supplies of non-European labour and that all that theywould be able to take would be limited numbers of highly skilled workers. Thepossibility of concluding definite agreements with them on this basis is being-further examined. It is clear, however, that only in the case of Australia, is it possible at this stage to reach agreements providing for migration facilities onany substantial scale.The Australian Government have raised the following point on the draftagreements. They do not feel able to accept the second sentence of clause 6 ofthe draft agreement regarding ex-service men and women, the effect of whichwould be to put ex-service men and women from this country on a level, as regardspriority in obtaining employment, with Australian ex-service men and women.The Australian authorities say that the general question of giving a priority to ex-service men for post-war employment is highly controversial and political inAustralia, and they have asked that this sentence should be deleted from theAgreement. After discussion with the Australian representative here, it wassuggested that the agreement might be amended by deletion of the sentence inquestion and the substitution of the following : &quot; All such settlers will, fromarrival in Australia, be assisted to obtain employment through existing Common-wealth and State Government machinery, and no ex-service men or women willbe granted a free passage without a reasonable assurance of suitable employment on first arrival.&quot; This wording would no doubt afford an adequate assurancefor the ex-service man on first arrival in Australia. But it would not protecthim in the case of loss of employment and subsequent efforts to find work, whenhe would find preference given to the Australian ex-service man. This particular question of priority for employment was the source of considerable difficulty inAustralia after the last war m relation to ex-service men from this country whowere provided with free passages to Australia. In order, therefore, to have a clearer view of the position, I telegraphed to our High Commissioner at Canberrato ask for a report from him on this aspect of the matter. I annex to thismemorandum a copy of the reply which I have received from him. together with[29600]Copy No.      3 5
a further telegram setting out relevant extracts from legislation now before theAustralian Parliament.Clearly he and his advisers hold very strongly the view that it is essentialthat we should press for Australian ex-service preference to be given to our menfrom this country. In the light of this advice I am satisfied that we ought tomake a further approach to the Australians on this point and I think that theopportunity afforded by the presence of two Australian Ministers in this country should be utilised for the purpose. The Minister of Labour, whom I have con-suited on the point, agrees.There is one further point outstanding in connection with the second draft agreement, namely, that relating to the assisted, passage scheme for non-servicemen and women. My department and the Treasury have been unable to reach agreement on the clause (paragraph 2 in the schedule to the draft agreement)under which the maximum payable by the individual migrant is  10 for eachadult. This maximum rate is strongly supported by the Australian Govern-ment, who are willing to share equally with the United Kingdom Governmentthe difference between  10 and the cost of passage, which may be of the orderof  65 to  75. Before the war, in the last assisted passage agreement madeon the subject, the minimum rate was  33 (subsequently raised to  37) of which 11 was paid by the migrant, the balance being borne in equal shares by the twoGovernments. The Treasury view is that something more closely approximatingto a tripartite division between the migrant and each of the two governments would be appropriate, i.e., that the migrant should pay  20 to  25. The Aus-Australian Governments view, which I support, is that this would place too heavy a burden on the migrant in need of assistance, and that we are justified, in allthe circumstances, in accepting the Australian view that the Governments should bear in equal parts a much larger share of the cost.I ask for the support of the War Cabinet in making an approach to -theAustralian Ministers regarding the grant of priority of employment for ourex-service men, similar to that given to Australian ex-service men. I should alsobe glad to&apos; learn whether, if the Australian Ministers are prepared to meet uson this point, I could be authorised to tell them that we for our part shouldbe willing to accept the remainder of the draft agreements, including the provi-sion fixing the maximum rate payable by the non-service migrant at  10 per headfor each aclult.C.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,11th April, 1945.
ANNEX.Telegram No. 420 of 3rd April, 1945, from United Kingdom High commissioner in Australia to Dominions Of/ice.There is no doubt that fact that ex-members of United Kingdom forces were not entitled to employment preference was a continuous source of grievanceand hardship after the last war, particularly in periods of under-employment.Many complaints were received regarding differential treatment and are mentioned in early correspondence between the British Government representatives-tive and Overseas Settlement Department and later with Dominions Office. Seefor example Crutchley&apos;s despatch No. 201 of 17th December, 1934, and No. 14026th June, 1935. In &quot;the latter, after referring to hardship involved on UnitedKingdom ex-servicemen by employment preference, under which, it had beenpossible for Returned Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen&apos;s Imperial League ofAustralia to secure discharge of United Kingdom ex-servicemen from government employment in order to make room for Australians, hope was expressed that this would be removed by decision of League (only takenin 1935) &quot; that where Imperial ex-servicemen were in jobs no action would betaken by the League to replace them with members of the A.I.F. on the preferenceclause.&quot; Complaints have, however, continued to be received and as recently as February representations were made by Imperial ex-servicemen employed as temporary clerks in Government departments in Melbourne that they are ineligiblefor &quot;promotions or permanencies because they are not recognised as ex-servicemen.As earlier examples, may be quoted discharges of Imperial ex-servicemen fromthe Swan Island Naval Depot in 1939 and the incident in 1931 after the WatersideWorkers Dispute when 350 United Kingdom ex-servicemen who had volunteeredand been promised permanent employment were discharged because they werenot entitled to preference.2. When representations have been made to the Commonwealth Governmentin the past, reply has been that preference was matter for States and that therewas no Commonwealth legislation on this subject although preference (which applied only to Commonwealth Public Service and Government Works) was giveneffect to in Commonwealth Public Service Regulations. Legislation in factexisted only in New South &quot;Wales and Victoria and only covered Governmentemployment.3. The position after this war is likely to be much more serious since legisla-tion now before Parliament provides for preference for period of seven years afterthe war (period which will no doubt be prolonged) applies to private as well as government employment and to the whole of Australia and covers civilians (alimited number it is true) who have been in actual contact with the enemy.Preference will thus be required both in private and public employment by lawand will not be susceptible to treatment by the Returned Soldiers, Sailors and airmen&apos;s Imperial League of Australia agreeing not to press for its applicationto United Kingdom servicemen. Extracts from Bill are contained in my immediately following telegram.4. In these circumstances the suggestion that no difficulty occurred inAustralia after the last war cannot be accepted and it is obvious, if difficultiesdid occur under limited preference privileges then in force, they are likely tobe much more serious under the new legislation and, so far as United Kingdomex-servicemen seeking employment in industry are concerned, will have a most fortunate effect on their prospects of employment. Much would depend, ofcourse, upon employment conditions generally, but the fact that it is felt necessaryto introduce legislation to give preference to ex-servicemen at ail suggests that the concession is regarded as of importance.5. I understand that the question has not been referred to higher authorityhere and that when clause first quoted in your telegram was referred todepartment here they requested clarification as it appeared that it might meanextension to United Kingdom ex-service personnel of all the provisions of the resettlement Bill including, e:g., loans to establish Australian ex-servicemenin business.   They have not asked for its omission.6. I suggest, therefore, that further effort should be made to have theemployment preference privileges extended to include ex-members of United
Kingdom forces who may settle in Australia. I appreciate the political difficultieswhich may be involved but we should I think be lacking in our responsibilitiestowards welfare of any United Kingdom ex-servicemen who may settle here ifthis matter were not made a point of principle.7. As to whether we should be justified in refusing to conclude any agree-ment which did not provide for parity of preference I hesitate to advise, but the omission of such provision should not be agreed to without the matter being-referred for decision to the Commonwealth Cabinet. Certainly the alternativeform of undertaking is valueless. The troubles which have arisen in the pasthave not been so much in regard to first employment as in connection with changes of employment a year or two after arrival.8. It is true that the Commonwealth will have greater powers overmigration and settlement than was case after last war and this to an extentprovides a safeguard, but Commonwealth Government could hardly interferewith operation of their own law. The numbers of Australians who will be eligiblefor preference will be so large (estimated at two-thirds of working population)that the effect of the preference might well be the practical exclusion from industrial employment of newcomers whilst on the other hand it can be urgedthat the number of United Kingdom ex-servicemen likely to settle here will be small in comparison.Telegram No. 421 of 3rd April, 1945, from United Kingdom High commissioner in Australia to Dominions Office.Following are extracts from the Re-establishment and EstablishmentBills :-&quot; 27- (1) An employer shall, in the engagement of any person for employ -ment, engage, in preference to any other person, a person entitled to preferenceunless he has reasonable and substantial cause for not doing so.(2) Any person entitled to preference may apply in writing to the employerconcerned to be engaged for employment in any position notwithstanding that employment in the position has not been offered to him.&quot;28. (1) Provides for application to Court by persons considering themselvesto be entitled to preference in employment.32. (1) Provides for where any person not otherwise entitled to benefitsconsiders that having regard to services performed by him in relation to thewar he is entitled to seek benefits, he may apply to the Central Preference board for registration.   (This extends scope of preference to certain civilians.)Clause 5 states that the regulations may provide for persons resident inAustralia who were during the war engaged on active service in the forces ofa prescribed part of the King&apos;s Dominions other than Australia, of a prescribedforeign Power allied with His Majesty or of any prescribed foreign authorityrecognised by His Majesty as competent to maintain forces for service in association with His Majesty&apos;s Forces, shall be deemed to be discharged memberof forces except for the purposes of the provisions of the Act relating topreference in employment and re-establishment leave. (Australian-born persons and those domiciled in Australia immediately prior to joining who have duringthe war been engaged on or called up for active service in the forces of any other part of the King&apos;s Dominions are included in definition &quot;member of forces.&quot;)Thus United Kingdom and Allied ex-servicemen could be given all the benefits of the Act including reinstatement in civil employment, facilities of the Common-wealth employment service, vocational training, various allowances and loans forre-establishment, housing, Legal Aid Bureau, &amp;o, but not employment preference.
