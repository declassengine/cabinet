(45) 229. \ April, 1945..war cabinet.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT is with real reluctance that I circulate my views which differ from thoseof the Cabinet Committee on the intricate challenge to sta\.smanship presented by contemporary Palestine. Although it is a tiny country r \d can never providea home for the millions of Jews who have suffered so terribly on the continent of Europe, none of us can fail to be moved by the hope so fervently and oftenexpressed by the Jews that here at least a haven of refuge for some of themmay be found. Yet if we mishandle the problem or produce a scheme whichdoes not work out in practice we risk an endless series of disputes, very probablyinvolving considerable British forces, which may shake our position in the wholeMiddle East and affect profoundly our relations with the other Great Powers.2. The solution proposed in the Palestine Committee&apos;s Report has the meritof being clear-cut and, at first sight, final and definite. Under the PartitionScheme the problem of Palestine would become a specifically internationalquestion and the responsibility for solving any difficulties which might arisewould devolve upon the Foreign Secretary. The Foreign Office has had muchexperience since the last war of the working of small States and enclaves suchas those which are now proposed. Moreover, the Middle East is of vital strategic importance to the whole British Empire, and the Foreign Office is responsiblefor preserving our interests in the key countries of Egypt and Iraq. In bothplaces events in Palestine have a direct and most important repercussion on our interests. I have, therefore, the less diffidence in putting forward my views onthe present scheme. The problem is one of so much importance to our futurethat the Cabinet must clearly consider it most carefully and should, I am sure,beware of being carried away by what may only be a paper solution.3... Let us first be clear on the essentials of the Palestine problem. We havehere a territorial conflict between two new and rapidly growing nationalisms.What is our fundamental interest in this question? It is not, I suggest, to backeither Arabs or Jews. As a Power with large Jewish and Moslem communitiesunder our rule we should not commit ourselves to either party. The problem is rather to keep our word (as far as it is possible to fulfil undertakings that arein themselves most difficult to reconcile), to produce a workable system withinwhich the communities can exist and develop as they both wish, and to maintain our position in the Middle East.4. Palestine policy cannot be considered as an isolated problem. It is partof the whole British policy in the Middle East. Major decisions regardingPalestine may have profound repercussions on essential British interests through-out the wider area.5.   British interests in the Middle East are vitally important, and any soundBritish Middle Eastern policy must be based primarily on the need for preservingand safeguarding them.   Conversely, any policy which endangers them may have12741   [29645] &apos; &apos; b
disastrous results. The special interests which must more particularly be borne in mind may be grouped under the headings (1) communications, (2) oil. and(3) strategic bases.6. Communications. The Middle East is a vital part of Imperial sea andair communications. The air routes via Cairo and the Persian Gulf, and thesea route via the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, can best be operated in times ofpeace, and defended in times of war, with the willing co-operation of the arab states through which they pass. The future administration and defence of the suez Canal will have to be the subject of negotiations with the Egyptian Govern-ment sooner or later probably within the next two years and with a WafdOpposition on the flank &apos;of the negotiators.7. Oil. The Kirkuk oilfield and the 600 miles long pipelines which bringthe oil across the desert to the eastern Mediterranean, lie entirely in Arab terri-tories, and are not easily defensible against Arab disorders. Other oilfields inArab territories are those in Koweit, Qatar and the other Arab States of thePersian Gulf. Even the Anglo-Iranian installations in Southern Persia arenot entirely independent of the Arab sphere; in order that they shall continue to function properly free passage is required through the national waters of Iraqfor oil tankers to and from the great Abadan refinery. The control of navigationand conservancy on the Shatt-el-Arab, by agreement with the Iraqi Government,is thus in itself an important British interest.8. Strategic bases. His Majesty&apos;s Government will continue after the war to require facilities for British armed forces in Arab countries. It may be desiredto retain the use of Alexandria as a naval base. His Majesty&apos;s ships will cer-tainly need facilities at Haifa, including facilities for refuelling with oil from iraq. There will be air bases in the Arab countries, including the treaty bases at Habbaniyah and Shaiba in Iraq. British ground troops will be stationed,probably in Palestine, as a Middle Eastern strategic reserve. These forces willrequire various kinds of facilities from the local Governments and the willing-collaboration of the local Arabs will be of assistance to the British Commanders.If His Majesty&apos;s Government were, through their Palestine policy, to incur the hostility of the Arabs, it might still be possible to obtain and use the facilities required, but it would certainly be very much more difficult and more costly.Our security would be sensibly less, and correspondingly larger garrisons wouldbe required.9. British policy has in the past recognised the fact that British interestscan best be secured by winning Arab goodwill. It has not been easy, in the face of the strong- feelings of the Arabs regarding Palestine, to win their goodwill.Nevertheless, British policy hitherto has achieved a. considerable measure ofsuccess. His Majesty&apos;s Government have been able to build up for themselvesthroughout the Middle East a reputation for fair dealing and for good intentions.The reward of this sound policy was that during the most critical phases of thewar, at a time when the Arabs might have been a troublesome military commit-ment for our hard-pressed forces in the Middle East, the Arab States as a wholetended to favour the British connexion, and did not try to take advantage of ourembarrassments. The brief Rashid Ali revolt, instigated by the Germans, servesonly to emphasise by contrast the strategic clangers to us of losing the confidence of the Middle Eastern peoples. Taken, as a whole, the attitude of the local Arabpopulations may have been a decisive factor in our ability to hold off the threatened German invasion.10. There will no doubt be many changes in the Middle East after the war.and not all of them to our advantage. During the past twenty-five years, GreatBritain has been the predominant Power in the Arab world. The British position has been almost unchallenged by the other Great Powers. Both the americans and the Russians are now beginning to take a new interest in the area. already in Saudi Arabia the Americans, intent mainly on the exploitation of theirimportant oil concession near the Persian Gulf, have insisted on sharing in our war-time subsidy to Ibn Saud, and are indeed pressing their lavish benefactionsupon him to such an extent that His Majesty&apos;s Government would have greatdifficulty in competing, even should they desire to do so. The friendship ofIbn Saud has been most valuable to us in the past, and we have always been ableto rely on him to use his great influence with the whole Arab world on our behalf.We have good relations, too. with his son, who should, succeed to both parts of ihis father&apos;s dominions.    The advent of a new American  patron will not
necessarily mean that Ibn Sand will wish to alter his friendly relations withHis Majesty&apos;s Government, but it will make him less dependent upon british assistance for his necessary supplies, and he may be less willing in the future to be helpful to us over Palestine questions. The Russians, too, will certainlytake a far greater interest in future in the Arab countries. Already they haveopened new diplomatic missions in Cairo, Bagdad, Damascus and Beirut. Ifwe lose Arab goodwill, the Americans and the Russians will be at hand and willprofit by our mistakes. It is unpleasant, and but for possible differences regard-ing Palestine it would probably be needless, to contemplate a future period ofcrisis in the Middle East, during which the Arab countries would be turning toRussia.11. Another new development is the tendency towards &quot; Arab unity.&quot; Therecent meeting of Arab representatives has resulted in the establishment ofmachinery for consultation and co-operation between the Arab States, which will undoubtedly facilitate a common front and joint action in times of crisis. Itwill be more unwise and more dangerous in future to engage in a conflict withthe Arabs about Palestine, and there will be less chance of localising any seriousdisturbances in Palestine itself. The late Lord Moyne warned me in a differentconnexion that we must face the new fact that the main idea of the leaders ofthe Arab States was to arrange to present an united front on anything that they regarded as an attack on any Arab State.12. Let us now examine the Palestine Committee&apos;s report in the light ofthis analysis of the position in the Middle East as a whole.13. Partition may seem to impartial people in this country an entirely fair and just solution of the problem of Palestine, a country claimed by both jews and Arabs. If collaboration has proved impossible, then, it may be argued, thefairest solution is to divide the disputed territory between the rival claimants.On the other hand it is important to recognise that the Arabs look on the position with eyes very different from our own. To the Arabs, Palestine is, and has been for centuries, a purely Arab country. In 1918 it had an Arab population of about600,000, whereas the Jews numbered only about 55,000. The flood of jewish immigrants, mostly from Eastern Europe, who have since arrived in virtue ofthe Mandate, but without Arab consent, have had no previous connexion withPalestine. Partition means to the Arabs the establishment of a Jewish state in an Arab country for the benefit of these Eastern European &quot; interlopers.&quot;It is difficult to exaggerate the strength of the feeling against Arab land being-handed over permanently to the Jews and becoming a Jewish State; for two years at least it was written in blood. The establishment of a Jewish Rome inPalestine is the settled policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the Arabs havestrongly resented the fact that we established it in Palestine rather than in some british territory. An attempt by-His Maje&quot;sty&apos;s Government to go even further and to set up a Jewish State there with unrestricted immigration would appearto the Arabs as an outrage, the more so because during the critical war years,when His Majesty&apos;s Government most needed Arab goodwill, the resources ofBritish propaganda were used to convince the Arabs that the policy of calling ahalt to Jewish immigration represented the firm and indeed &quot;final&quot; policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government. I am aware that so far as the Arabs inside Palestineare concerned our best local advisers anticipate that the partition plan will causelocal Arab riots but no more serious or lasting effects upon Anglo-Arah relations.I greatly regret that after taking the best available advice from surroundingcountries I cannot bring myself to believe that the matter can be dismissed soeasily there. The views of His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in Cairo and Bagdad havebeen circulated to the Cabinet (W.P. (44) 253). I feel I must accept their advice that the reaction in the Arab world generally to any form of partition withunrestricted immigration, even if not immediate, will be deep-rooted, permanent,and very severe. It is likely permanently to destroy Arab goodwill towards us inthe independent Arab States and would therefore imperil British intereststhroughout the Middle East. I do not think the military implications of sucha development either during the war or later have been adequately considered yet.14. But when we come to examine the proposal in detail, it becomes clearthat the scheme of partition put forward by the Committee goes so Consistentlyagainst the Arabs as to be an additional provocation to them. The new jewish state is to contain nearly twice as much Arab as Jewish land. It will containnearly as many Arabs as Jews (in round numbers 339,000 Arabs to 392,000 Jews).All the best land is to be given to the Jews. The remaining Arab area of[29645] b 2
Palestine, which will be absorbed into Southern Syria, is described as &quot; definitelya deficit area,&quot; and its property tax assessment represents only about 12 per cent,of the assessment of Palestine as a whole. Most of the Arab industries will beincluded within the Jewish State, and both the principal seaports, each witha large Arab population, are to be given to the Jews. It would not be easy to persuade the Arab Governments that it is equitable or consonant with themandate, or with the Atlantic Charter, or with our own war-time publicity,to include in the Jewish State all the best land, practically all the industries, theonly good ports and about a third of the Arab inhabitants. It may be arguedwith much force that we have contributed immensely to Arab independence and prosperity, and that there is a very strong moral obligation on the Arabs toreciprocate by enabling us to discharge handsomely an obligation of honourtowards a persecuted race inseparably connected with Palestine. But to standa reasonable chance of getting any measure of this spirit from the Arabs, itseems essential that the sacrifice that those in Palestine are asked to make shouldbe balanced by some redressing factor. Since the plan for Greater Syria is nolonger current politics, at the crucial time, an adequate redressing factor is entirely lacking.15. Administratively, the proposed partition frontiers are long and compli-cated, and would, I fear, involve very great friction. They would make it most difficult to control the movements of terrorists or armed bands belonging to either side. Alternatively, the frontier control would have to be costly and so elaborateas to be very vexatious to the constant civilian traffic. I think experience inEurope shows conclusively that unless frontiers are accepted freely on bothsides, complicated lines cause great friction, however sensible the arrangementslook on paper. Enclaves (such as Galilee and the Jerusalem State would be)have. I think, rightly fallen into disfavour. The Free City of Danzig, the PolishCorridor, the autonomous Memel territory, the Saar, are all ominous precedents.16.. I realise that criticisms such as these could be made in regard to almostany scheme of partition. The Palestine Committee&apos;s work has been most valuablein the light it has thrown on the fundamentals of this problem. I have con-sidered very carefully in the light of them whether it would be possible to deviseany plan of partition which would be free of the kind of inequalities and diffi-culties which I have described. I have been unable to think of such a plan, andI have therefore been driven reluctantly to the conclusion that in spite of itsapparent attractions partition is not a final solution of the problem.17. It seems to me, on reflection, that the Committee&apos;s proposals are basedon two hypotheses, each one of which seems to be doubtful; and that the proposals have not taken account of one important political consideration.18. The first hypothesis is that it will be as difficult to control Jewish immi-gration in the future as it has been in the past. I cannot myself believe thatthis will be so. The principal difficulty in dealing with illegal Jewish immi-grants in the last ten years has been the public knowledge that they were liableto be terribly maltreated and even killed if they were compelled to return tothe territories they had left. The position is, however, substantially changed,if not transformed, by the imminent ending of persecution of the Jews in Europe.Last year Sir Herbert Emerson, the International Commissioner for Refugees,in a confidential report, expressed the conviction that it was essential in theinterest of the Jews themselves that the centrifugal movement from europe should be actively discouraged, and in all the Armistices we have negotiatedthere has been provision that all discriminatory legislation must be repealed.Neither here nor in Palestine, therefore, should we politically be subject to thesame overpowering moral pressure as in the past in the matter of administeringimmigration.19. The second hypothesis is that partition represents a final solution.Can we really believe, more particularly in the light of the known views of theJewish Agency, that the Zionists, seeing the visions that we know them to see,having achieved the results that we know them to have achieved, and encouragedas they are from outside quarters, will accept as final the frontiers proposed?Even if the new Jewish State were induced to accept finality in the terms of theTreaty that brought it into existence, I believe that my colleagues will share myunhappy conviction that that clause of the Treaty would be neither sacred noreternal. Indeed, this would be contrary to the whole present trend of the problem.It seems inevitable that the Zionists -more particularly when the prudent hand of Dr. Weizrnann is removed......-would fill their State up far beyond its capacity
i 9 9L fj mC1) W.P. (45) 214,and so prove their need for more living space first, no doubt, the JerusalemState. With the funds available to American and British Zionism, there shouldnot be any real economic deterrent to such a policy. This constant increase ofthe population, supporting a claim for more space, would not be a peaceful andcontrollable evolution; it would be a constant anxiety and irritant, and HisMajesty&apos;s Government would not be able to escape their ultimate responsibilityfor maintaining law and order. They would merely be less able than at present to control the situation and to prevent crises from arising.20. This brings me to the political consideration of which I think account has not been taken. It is surely extremely improvident to create a new State andundertake to defend it by force of arms unless we are as certain as possiblethat we are also the controlling political influence in that State. This is (or was)the case for us in Iraq as in Northern Ireland. The danger to ourselves that Iforesee in the proposed Jewish State is that the highly organised, active andirresponsible Zionists in America (and not in America only), and even Americanpolitical leaders also, will be perpetually influencing the policy of the new state in a sense that will exacerbate the Arabs surrounding it, and that the responsi-bility for defence will rest under our scheme, apart from the Jews themselves,entirely upon us. This situation should in theory be modified, as far as disputes between the three new States are concerned, by the arbitral duties of the proposed international Body on which the United States as a Government may or maynot be represented: but there is surely no certainty that the United Nations, which include many Arab States, will ever approve of our scheme and be ready to setup this Body whose competence in any case is restricted to the three new States.Partition, indeed, transfers the issue from the Colonial Office to the ForeignOffice and the Service Departments. If one tries to look ahead, it may proveessential that this American interest in Palestine should be tempered by some form of responsibility more direct than the mere possibility of United Statesrepresentation on the International Body, or than indefinite responsibilities for maintaining the peace through the World Organisation.21. I am as anxious as my colleagues to take account of and meet thepassionate and partly realised hopes aroused by the Balfour Declaration, andto retain the Zionists, the dynamic force in Jewry, among the ranks of our friends.It is repugnant to prophesy so funereally about a plan to which so much thought.has been devoted, and one which might seem at first sight the only methodpracticable by which His Majesty&apos;s Government can give a measure of effectto the twin obligations under the mandate, or to the expectations raised by the balfour Declaration, and at the same time enable Arabs and Jews to enjoy the self-government and independence that is now being (or about to be) enjoyedelsewhere in the Middle East. I should welcome almost any solution that gave a hope of finality, but I cannot recommend to the Cabinet that the scheme in theCommittee&apos;s Report should be accepted. I wish to urge most strongly thatwe should examine this question again on a new basis. I see no alternative, ifserious trouble deriving from the rising tides of nationalism is to be avoided,to our remaining in general control of policy in this area.22. It is. I think, right that my colleagues in the Cabinet, when consideringthe revised Report of the Palestine Committee, should be aware that I see strong objections to the Committee&apos;s proposals, and that they should be made acquainted with the nature of these objections. At the same time I understand thatopposition to these proposals entails a responsibility to advise on an alternative policy. Meanwhile, the Minister Resident in the Middle East has transmitted to His Majesty&apos;s Government his comments on the Palestine Committee&apos;sReport^1) accompanied by an expression of his views on an alternative policy forPalestine. I would wish to have the opportunity of studying what Sir EdwardGrigg has to say, and to take his views into account, before making positiverecommendations. The present paper should therefore be regarded, not as a finalcontribution to the formulation of policy for Palestine, but as an introductionto positive proposals which I hope it may be found possible to base on the recom-mendation of the Minister Resident in the Middle East.j-t    .    nM A.
