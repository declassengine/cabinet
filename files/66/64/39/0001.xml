IWAR CABINETTHE ORGANIZATION FOR MILITARY GOVERNMENTIN germany memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. Planning for the control of Germany has been proceeding hitherto on the generalassumption that there will be a formal surrender by an effective Government of Germanyand that a central German Administration will remain in being which will be controlled by an inter-Allied Control Commission sitting in Berlin. Possible deviations from theseconditions have, it is true, been contemplated, but none of these deviations have beenfundamental. Above all, it has been a cardinal feature of the planning that the inter-Allied Control Commission, even if it cannot function effectively from the start over thewhole field of its activities, should be introduced into Berlin and start functioning as an instrument of control at a very early date.2. It now looks as though there will be no formal surrender by a German Govern-Government, no central German Administration and no opportunity for an effective inter-allied control Commission for some time. The indications are that the various Allied forces will move into their own national zones rapidly, and that their national commanderswill be faced with the complete responsibility for all that is done in their zones, includingthe task of controlling the German people and seeing that they are fed and set to work,without agreed direction from a central inter-Allied Control Commission.3. So far as the co-ordinating work of the inter-Allied Control Commission itself isconcerned, experience at the European Advisory Commission has shown thatunanimous decisions on which the working of the Commission machinery is based are difficult to obtain rapidly, if they can be obtained at all. Apart from the difficultieswhich may be envisaged in the working of the Commission itself, the conditions inGermany all militate against control from the centre being exercised in the initial stagesthrough German channels. Rail, road, telephone, telegraph and post have sufferedgreat destruction and communications from the centre will be extremely difficult. Fora long period, such of these facilities as remain or can be improvised will be limited andoverstrained. During this initial period, therefore, there will be few resources availableother than those at the disposal of the Army [e.g., communications, transport, etc.).The power to take effective action in the zone will be largefy dependent upon the ability of the Army to release these resources for this purpose.4. If the: situation as outlined in paragraph 3 is a reasonable forecast, the british commander-in-Chief may well be faced at the start and for some time to come with thenecessity of controlling and administering his own zone as best be can. His primarytask will be the problem of bringing food to the population in his zone and finding-employment for them, and the North-Western zone is likely, as events have turned out,to be the most difficult to handle and the least attractive to administer. The Russianzone includes a food surplus area and a comparatively undamaged industrial area; theAmerican zone, though deficient in certain essential foodstuffs, is more nearly self-sufficient than the British zone, which, besides being deficient in foodstuffs, contains an industrial area which is in ruins and is, in fact, an area with little agriculture and alarge population which it cannot support.5. If the burden of responsibility for control and administration in the British zoneis to fall solely on the Commander-in-Chief of the British forces without any effectiveassistance, especially material assistance from the inter-Alliecl Control Commission whichit has hitherto been assumed would be available, it becomes of great importance that theofficer to be appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British zone should be designatednow, so that a. suitable officer, acceptable to him, can be appointed as his Deputy.   The
task of this Deputy would be to plan for the work ahead, in the light of the informationnow available, and to enable firm decisions to be arrived at, both as regards policyand as regards organization.6. The following immediate action also appears desirable:  (a) As regards organization there is at S.H.A.E.F. a civil affairs staff controlling thecivil affairs work of the various Army Groups, and the headquarters of theseArmy Groups are also provided with a civil affairs staff. These staffs have 1been established to deal with the period before hostilities cease. Pendingtheir cessation a portion of the British element of the inter-Allied control commission, which includes technical experts of the highest calibre, isbeing made available to S.H.A.E.F. on a temporary basis to assist duringthe present period. It is the intention that, when the inter-Allied control commission is set up in Berlin, it will absorb, if required, the British portionof the S.H.A.E.F. civil affairs staff.As much assistance as possible should also now be given to the british commander-in-Chief, in his capacity as Supreme Authority and military governor in the zone, from the technical staff collected for the British element of the inter-Allied Control Commission. Arrangements have already been 1made to this end. These should be of immediate assistance to him in meetinghis current problems and will enable him to face the immediate post-hostilityperiod with an effective control staff in being.The action already taken and being taken as above will not prevent thestaff of the British element of the inter-Allied Control Commission attachedtemporarily both to S.H.A.E.F. and to the British Commander-in-Chief from ?:joining the remainder of the British element and their American, Russian and *French colleagues on the Commission as soon as the latter is in a position feffectively to discharge the functions of control in Germany that have been 1agreed for it through the discussions at the European Advisory Commission.   \(b) As regards supplies, S.H.A.E.F. has put in to Washington, or is putting in,   1demands which will cover his requirements for Germany up to the end of INovember.   There is, however a danger that, when S.H.A.E.F. ceases tobe responsible for civil affairs administration, and the zones fall apart under Iseparate national control, the Americans may be unwilling, even if the fsupplies have been allocated to meet S.H.A.E.F.&apos;s demand, to make them 1available for the British zone.   It is, therefore, desirable that the Ministers l;now in Washington should be warned of this possibility and should endeavour Iif opportunity offers to get agreement that such demands as are now approved 1shall be made available for the areas for which they were originally intended, gregardless of where the responsibility for the administration of these areas jrests when the time comes. A telegram to this effect has been sent to IWashington.(c) As regards industries in the British zone and setting the people to work, it is almost desirable that the British Commander-in-Chief should now be given ithe necessary directives, based on the assumption that he will have to make 1arrangements for his zone in anticipation of any general policy which may 1later be agreed at the inter-Allied Control Commission on a pan-German Ibasis.y. To sum up, I ask my colleagues to agree that in the light of present circumstances Iarrangements should so far as possible be made to enable the British Commander-in- IChief to control and administer the British zone for such period as may be necessary iwith the minimum of guidance from the inter-Allied Control Commission.   I also ask that for this purpose he may be given such directives as may be necessary, particularlyin regard to the employment of German labour on agricultural and industrial work.P.
