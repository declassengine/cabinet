THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   A pril 1945.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (45) 250.lAth April, 1945.WAR CABINET.MAN-ROWER IN 1945.Directive by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.1. At the &quot; Argonaut &quot; Conference it was agreed that for the purpose of planning production and allocating man-power the earliest date for the end ofthe German war should be assumed to be the 1st July, 1945, and the latest the31st December, 1945. The deterioration in the German situation in the few weeksthat have elapsed since the Conference has been far more rapid than was foreseen.The disruption of the Western front, the annihilation of a great part of hisarmies in the West, and the virtual exhaustion of his oil stocks, have presented the enemy with a situation which he cannot retrieve. The time has now come when we can look forward with confidence to the end of organised resistance this summer. I therefore propose that we should now adopt as a firm date for ailour plans the 31st May. If our preparations are related to that date, we shallnot be materially at fault if the end of the war comes a week or two earlieror later.2. It will be the duty of the Chancellor of the Exchequers Man-power committee to discharge the same tasks in the period of national demobilisationas they have undertaken in the period of national mobilisation. Theyshould first call for a report from the Service Departments on the state of readiness of their machinery for release. It is of the utmost importance thatreleases from all three Services should begin not more than six weeks after theend of the German war.3. The Chiefs of Staff should present without delay to the DefenceCommittee a statement of the size of the forces which they plan to deploy against japan. These should be related strictly to what can be brought into action intime to play a part within the assumed duration of the Japanese war.   When[29711]
this calculation has been completed, the level of munitions required to sustainthese forces should be worked out, and administrative preparations in India andthe Far East should be adjusted as may be found necessary.4. The Man-power Committee should then draw up a balance sheet to cover the period the 1st June to 31st December, 1945. I call upon the Service Depart-ments and the Ministry of Labour to ensure that much greater progress is made during this period in reducing the Services and Munitions industries to theultimate Staere II levels than has hitherto been suggested.5. I trust that the processes I have outlined above may be brought to a conclusion so that the results can be presented to the War Cabinet by the middleof May.&quot;w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1.
