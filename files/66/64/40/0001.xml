This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentPrinted for the War Cabinet, April, 1945TOP secret.P. (45) 2401:2th April, 1945The  circulation  of this   paper   has  been strictly   limited,-    It   is   issued   for   the personal use of copy No.  3 5WAR CABINETMANPOWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST.MEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR  WAR1. in December, 1044 the Prime Minister instructed me to submit proposals to effectreductions in the manpower of the Middle East by(a) The release to other theatres of 50,000 men from the services.(b) A 25 per cent, cut of the ration strength and of the directly employed civil labour.2. At my request the Commander in Chief, Middle East, put forward proposals to effectthese reductions to the maximum extent compatible with his responsibilities for maintaining the proper functioning of the Middle East as a Base, and the maintenance of Internal security.The reductions proposed have been examined by the War office and the Air Ministry and areas followsU.K. Ron U.K.Men Men total,920 3,260 10,18015,590 11,720 27,31022,5102,53013.31015,840I4,cRelease of 50,000 service men to other Theatres.(a) From Army operational units(b) From Army administrative units(c) From reduced RAF Commitments (i) Eastern Mediterranean(ii) Base, training and administrative unitsTotal R.A.F.Total Service men to be released to other theatresBalance towards the cut of 25 per cent, in the ration strength.id) Reductions already made between the date on which the PrimeMinister based  his instructions and   the Commander in Chiefsubmitted his proposals(e) Civilians released by the release of service men : From Military units from R.A.F. units(/) The release and return of Allied troops as soon as political circum-stances permit  ...Total reduction in Middle East manpower ...37.49015,84053.33017,30019,6405,6207,020102,9103. In submitting these proposals the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East has drawn attention to the fact that the Forces at present at his disposal are less than those considered necessary for the maintenance of internal security under present conditions. The internal security situation is one of uneasy equilibrium which shows little prospect of improvement.4. The reductions proposed will inevitably aggravate the situation, especially thereduction in United. Kingdom forces of 22,510 the greater part of which comes fromadministrative units, who, in addition to their normal tasks have ,a role as internal securitytroops,
5&apos; To make this reduction possible the Commander-in-Chief has revised his internal security policy and proposes that in future : (a) Only first priority railways will be guarded.(ft) Protection will be provided only for British and Allied nationals and essentialinstallations upon which the continuance of the war effort depends.(c) British civilian property will not be protected unless specially required by HisMajesty&apos;s Embassy.(cl) Depots and administrative installations will be responsible for their protection withtheir own men, without reinforcement,(e) The maximum use of Indian troops will be made for purely defensive duties.6. After consultation with the Chiefs of Staff I informed the Prime Minister that I was prepared to accept these implications on the understanding that everything possible should bedone to ensure that relations between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the local governments in the Middle East remain friendly and that co-operation should be real. In particular it isessential that: In Palestine our policy is not such as to lead to armed rebellion.In Egypt we foster good relations and ensure the efficiency of the Egyptian Army.Further, it is most desirable that in Syria and Lebanon a strong and well equippedgendarmerie is at the disposal of the Governments to maintain law and order, and that theTroupes Speciales are transferred to the control of the State.7. In putting forward the proposals to the Prime Minister I pointed out that theserious internal security implications and the real administrative drawbacks of the reductions could be justified only as an emergency measure to meet vital requirements in manpower and to make essential cuts in our expenditure in the Middle East, and I considered that theWar Cabinet should be so informed.My proposals have been approved by the Prime Minister, and executive action to makethe agreed reductions is now being taken.P. J. G.War Office,12th April, 1945.(13 45/07)    no   4/45    W.O.P.    21814
