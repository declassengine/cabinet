Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1945.SECRET.W.P. (45) 209.(    2,1st March, 1945.WAR CABINET.WORLD ORGANISATION.Outstanding Points.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THERE are certain outstanding points in connection with the proposedWorld Organisation on which I must seek the advice of my colleagues before theinter-Commonwealth meeting on this subject.A. Guarantee of Territorial Integrity.2. In contradistinction to the Covenant of the League of Nations, no specificguarantee of territorial integrity is provided in the Dumbarton Oaks proposals.Under Article X of the Covenant, Members of the League &quot; undertook to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existingpolitical independence of all Members.&quot; No definite obligation was, however,laid upon the Members to give effect to this provision. Many of them, particularlyCanada, indicated their dislike of this obligation from time to time, and inpractice it was a dead letter. Article X was to some extent counter-balanced by article XIX, whereby &quot;the Assembly shall from time to time advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of  Treaties which have comeinapplicable.....&quot;    But in practice Article XIX was never invoked,, one possible reason being that member States were always able to quote Article X.The latter article was also constantly used by critics of the League of nations to show that its Members had guaranteed for all time frontiers which there were no legal means of changing without the consent of the State concerned.3. The absence of any such guarantee is likely to be criticised by many ofthe smaller Powers, and Australia, and New Zealand have already done so publicly.4. I suggest, however, that it is a point on which we ought to stand firm,arguing generally that there can be no question of the Council changing anyfrontier unless by the requisite majority it decides that this is essential in thegeneral interests of the preservation of international peace and security.B. Guarantee of Political Independence.5. The Dumbarton Oaks proposals equally contained no guarantee of thepolitical independence of member States. The reasons for this were briefly asfollows.6. The question of &quot; political independence &quot; raises issues of a rather different character. The Moscow Declaration has already based the organisation on the &quot; sovereign equality &quot; of all States, which implies that the Members ofthe Organisation will retain legal control over their own actions except in so farNas they agree by treaty to limit it. AH States naturally attach the highest value totheir political independence, and the principal statesmen have made repeateddeclarations that they intend to respect the independence of other. States.7. But an undertaking to respect the political independence of other Statesdoes not necessarily involve a commitment to guarantee it.   It is, moreover, not[29561]opy No.   O D
2easy to-define exactly what &quot; political independence &quot; is. One State may control the actions of another State by indirect means. It is impossible to define the line which divides such actions from what is generally regarded as the legitimateinfluence which one State may exercise on the actions of another. The objectionto any guarantee of &quot; political independence,&apos;&apos; therefore, is that it could onlyextend.to external and legal forms. It could not take into account more indirectmethods.8. The views of the United Kingdom delegation were confirmed atDumbarton Oaks by the attitude of the United States and Soviet representatives;&apos;but here again Australia and New Zealand favour such a guarantee.9. I recommend that we should be prepared to give way if there should be general support for the proposal. [After all, the assumption that such indepen-dence will be at any rate respected is implicit in the whole of the Dumbarton Oaksplan.] If, however, such a guarantee is provided for, it will be necessary to con-sider the drafting of it very carefully, since, unless it is qualified in some way, itmight commit us to recognising the full and immediate independence of India.G. Domestic Jurisdiction,10. The question of &quot;: disputes arising out of matters which by InternationalLaw are solely within the domestic jurisdiction of the State concerned&quot;(Chapter VIII A (7) of the Dumbarton Oaks proposals) was not properly dis-cussed at Dumbarton Oaks and will no doubt receive further consideration at san Francisco. It has been discussed with the Attorney-General, and the line itis proposed to take is that the Charter should not give any member of the united nations the right to require that a dispute or situation arising out of domestic-jurisdiction matters should be submitted to the means of settlement mentionedin Chapter VIII A (3), but that, if such a dispute or situation constitutes a threat to the maintenance of peace or security or if a breach of the peace occurs in conse-quence of such a situation or dispute, it should be open to the Security Council totake such action as it may deem appropriate, acting in accordance withChapter VII A (1), and the relevant provisions of Chapter VIII B. This wouldmean in effect continuing the position under the Covenant under which states were under no obligation to submit such questions to methods of peaceful settle-ment, but modifying it, in that the Security Council would be entitled to intervene to prevent or suppress a breach of the peace arising out of such a question.11. It is clear that this proposal, if accepted, would mean that in the last resort we could not prevent the Security Council from considering a dispute with.e.q., India, to which, we were a party, provided only that the Council had decidedthat the continuance of the dispute was likely to endanger the maintenance ofinternational peace and security. It is, however, very unlikely that in any case a dispute between two members of the Organisation, even if they were both membersof the British. Commonwealth, would be excluded from discussion by the Councilon the ground that it was a matter of domestic jurisdiction; any such attemptwould be strongly resisted by the Member of the Commonwealth which wanted thedispute dealt with in this way. On the other-hand, it is true that under the Yaltavoting formula we could, if we so desired, block any action which the Organisa-tion might otherwise take against us as a result of its consideration of such, a dispute. Equally, even though under this formula the Security Council mighthave the right to take cognisance of a dispute between, e.g., India and SouthAfrica, it could, not in practice do so in the face of opposition by the UnitedKingdom unless, of course, the United Kingdom was itself a party to the dispute.It seems in any case most unlikely that an inter-Commonwealth dispute would reach the stage where it constituted a threat to peace.12. For these reasons I suggest that the proposed formula should be approved; for in the last resort the Security Council must (subject to the Yaltaarrangements) have the right to take measures necessary to secure international peace and security.D. Control of Enemy Powers.13. Chapter XII (2) of the Dumbarton. Oaks proposals reads as follows : &quot; No provision of the Charter should preclude action taken or authorised inrelation to enemy States as a result of the present war by the Governments havingresponsibility for such action.&quot;
14. It is obviously undesirable that the World Organisation, which canonly at the earliest be established towards the end of the present year, should at once have authority over the Control Commission to be established in Germanyand over the Control Commissions already established in other enemy States.Indeed, it would probably be generally agreed that it would be undesirable forthe World Organisation to attempt to exercise such authority during the period when these States will be occupied by Allied troops. We cannot tell at presenthow long the occupation period will last, but, when it ends, there will be two possibilities. Either, in fact, the control of these countries will depend on the supervision by the principal Powers concerned of the treaties which they willby that time presumably have concluded with our enemies, or it will depend onthe exercise by the World. Organisation of general authority with a view to preventing further aggression on their part.15. This does not mean that in the second eventuality there will be no needfor special treaties between the Powers concerned pledging themselves to take action in the event of attempts to violate the peace treaties; but it does mean thatenforcement action should be taken as the result of a decision of the security council and not as the result of some single treaty obligation.16. I suggest, therefore, that we ought to take the line at the BritishCommonwealth meeting, and, subject to that discussion, urge in San Franciscothat the exclusion of the World Organisation from the control of enemy orex-enemy States should be for the period of occupation only, and that thereafteronly the consent of the permanent members of the Security Council should benecessary to charge the Organisation with the general and ultimate responsi-bility for preventing aggresion on the part of the ex-enemy States.A. E.Foreign Office, 31st March, 1945.
