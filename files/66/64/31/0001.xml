THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1945.Copy No.WAR CABINET.SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND FOR four weeks ENDING 25th MARCH, 1945.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.A. A detailed summary of operations is appended.B. Results of Operations.1. Oil Targets.MANY successful attacks were made on oil targets during the period.The Alma Pluto and Nordstern benzol plants at Gelsenkirchen, which were attacked on the 27th and 28th February respectively, suffered very-heavy damage and were both put out of action. Photographs taken after the raid on theSalzbergen oil refinery showed that severe damage had been inflicted on the boiler-house and power-plant, and that the refinery was inactive. The Bohlen synthetic oil plant, which was attacked twice by Bomber Command and once by theU.S.A.A.F., was extensively damaged. When photographs were taken on theday after the last attack on the 20th /21st March, which wras carried out by bomber Command, the plant was inactive and damage could be seen to gas-holdersaad pipe-bridges in the complex of buildings north of the refinery.Heavy attacks were made on oil refineries at Harburg and Bremen : atHarburg most of the oil storage tanks which had escaped intact in previousraids were damaged, and photographs taken two days after the attack on Bremenshowed no sign of activity in the plant. When photographs were taken after the attack on the Heide oil refinery, which was also attacked by the U.S.A.A.F., fires were still burning in the northern part of the target, but damage to the mainand secondary distillation units and further damage to the oil extraction plantcould be seen. The refinery was inactive. It was estimated from photographiccover obtained during the last week of the period that the Gneisenau and august Viktoria benzol plants (attacked on the 17th March), the synthetic oil plant at Wanne-Eickel (attacked on the 4th March), and the Dahlbusch benzolplant at Gelsenkirchen (attacked on the 13th/14th March) would all be out ofaction for at least a month.Photographs of the Scholven Buer synthetic oil plant taken after the attacks by Bomber Command and the U.S.A.A.F., on the 10th and 12th March, respec-tively. showed heavy damage to the compressor houses, the southern ejector house and the western contact oven house. The plant is unlikely to be able to resumeproduction for some months. Widespread damage was caused to the Erin. RauxelTar, Emsche Lippe North, Emsche Lippe South and Bruchstrasse benzol plants.Other oil targets attacked include the oil refineries of Hamburg D.P.A.G.,Harpenerweg and Misburg, the Lutzkendorf synthetic oil plant and the MathiasStinnes benzol plant.2. German Towns.The heavy attacks on Hagen on the 15th/16th March and Witten on the18th/19th March completed the virtual devastation of all the industrial townsin the Ruhr of any size.    Prints Nos. 1 and 2 show some of the tremendous[29638]SECRET.W.P. (45) 231.9th April, 1945.
damage inflicted in these two attacks. In the raid on Hildesheim on the22nd March the greater part of the city was destroyed and only the outersuburban areas escaped damage. Print No. 3 shows the very heavy damageinflicted on Chemnitz; Flanau, attacked on the 18th/19th March, suffered equallyseverely. Photographs of Kassel, which was also attacked twice by the U.S.A.A.P.,showed a large area of devastation west of the river in the built-up districts whichhad not previously suffered heavy damage. Important industrial concernsdamaged included the Henschel A.F.V. and M.T. works.The attack on Wurzburg on the 16th/17th March was highly successful,causing very severe damage throughout the town. All the tracks were cut at thestation, and much rolling-stock destroyed or derailed. Most of the industrialplants and public utilities were wholly or partially destroyed, and the oil storagearea east of the station was devastated. Print No. 4 shows some of the damage.The eastern and south-eastern parts of Nuremberg which in previous attacks had escaped comparatively lightly were heavily damaged on the 16th-7th March.Photos;raohs taken on the 14th March show that extensive damage was caused in the attack on Barmen the previous clay. Transportation facilities were affected and at least eight large industrial premises were severely damaged. Print No. 5shows the results of the attack on Dessau on the 7th-8th March.Prints Nos. 6-8 show the results of recent attacks on Mainz, Zweibriickenand Worms.3. Transportation Targets.The Arnsberg viaduct which carries the main line east from Schwerte andthe Ruhr was attacked on the 19th March by 19 aircraft. PhotoPTaohs takentwo hours after the attack show that about 100 feet of the viaduct collapsed intothe river below (see Print No. 9). Two sections of the overland approach viaductof the Arberffen bridge were destroyed on the 21st March and the following;day the Nienberg railway bridge was completely destroyed together with thegreater part of the approach viaducts. The attack on the Bremen bridge on the23rd March wrecked the temporary span at the south end of the bridge and north of the target where the railway crosses the Nordstrasse the eastern trackreceived a direct hit on the north abutment. Print No. 10 shows the Bielefeldviaduct after the successful attack on the 14th March. In all these attacks22.000 lb. and 12.000 lb. Tallboy bombs were used.Nine aircraft carrying Tallboy bombs attacked Bad Oeynbausen railway bridge on the 23rd March and scored at least two direct hits, one of which caused the central span of the northern track to fall into the river. The Dortmund-EmsCanal at Ladbergen which had been repaired since Bomber Commands attackon the 1st January was breached again in two niaces on the 3rd-4th Marchand rendered completely unnavigable.A large number of marshalling yards were bombed, particularly during thelast week of the period in support of 21st Army Group&apos;s crossing of the Rhinenorth and south of the river Wesel. At Hamm, Recklinghausen, Rheine andSterkrade, many tracks were cut and heavy damage caused to rolling-stock and thepermanent way.Attacks were made on a number of enemy troop concentrations and strong-holds, the most outstanding of which were the two attacks on Wesel. Very heavy damage was caused throughout the towns of Bocholt, Diilmen, Dorsten&apos; andGladbeck, all of which were attacked for their importance as supply &quot;centres for the German western, front. In the raids on Essen and Dortmund, attackedprimarily as important communication, centres in the Ruhr area, roads were rendered impassable and railway tracks blocked.4. Results of Precious Attacks.Photographs obtained on the day after the attack on Horten (23rd-24thFebruary) show very severe damage to the dockyard, area. Buildings on bothsides of - the dry dock and the wet dock have been gutted and the W/T station,the torpedo factory, the casting slips, and the ship plates building have all been heavily damaged. The south-west part of Duisburg which had suffered lessthan the rest of the town in previous attacks was severely damaged on the21st-22nd February. Buildings hit include the main station, the goods depotand sidings in the marshalling yard, locomotive and repair shops and the rollingmill and associated buildings of Vereinigte Stahlwerke A.G. The tremendousdamage inflicted on the synthetic oil plant of Pblitz can be seen in Print No. 11.
