T IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS be printed for the War Cabinetirculation of thiTOP secret.P. (45) 245.13th April, 1945.WAR CABINET.V-WEAPON SITES-PUBLICITY.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.WE have considered, from the point of view of our future security, thesuggestion^ put forward by the Minister of Information that the substance ofthe facts contained in the report t on large &quot;Crossbow&quot; sites in northern france should be made public at once.2. It is important that we should perfect our knowledge of V-weapons and,therefore, that the enemy should not be helped by any premature publicity in his task of deciding what documents, &amp;c, on this subject should be destroyed.3. We believe, however, that the Germans will attempt to destroy or hideall documents relating to V-weapons, irrespective of the extent of our knowndiscoveries. We do not think, therefore, that the publication of a compositepicture of the large sites, based on fact and conjecture, will have any bearing on the destruction or otherwise of documents by the enemy. This will dependalmost entirely on the hazards of war.4. We consider, however, that it would be unwise to publish details, whichmight assist research in other countries, as to the concept of the Mimoyecquesgun and how this concept was to be realised, or of the installations necessary forfiring it.Recommendation.5. We see no objection to the unofficial release to the press of the contents of the report on large &quot;Crossbow&quot; sites in Northern France, subject to theabove reservation with regard to Mimoyecques.(Signed) A.
