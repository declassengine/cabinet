The Russians have made some progress across the River Volkhov nearChudovo. This is the first change since mid-January, when four bridgeheadswere obtained over this river.Lake Ilmen-Lake Beliger Sector.18. Up to the present it is impossible to give any details in amplificationof the press reports of Russian, victories against the 16th German Army in theStara Russa area. This, success appears to have been against some three divisionsforming part of the 16th Army and was the culmination of a series of lesseroperations extending over several weeks. The fact that German divisions were cut off suggests that these forces must have been in a salient somewhere between
Stara Russa and Kholm, two points at which the Russians have been fighting.This salient would presumably stretch between these two points towardsDemyansk. ,Central Sector.19. Fighting is reported at Velizh, in tihe Rzhev area and north of Yukhnov,but there appears to have been little change in the situation.Ukraine.20. Mention was made last week of the progress of German counter-attacks against the south-western flank of the Donets salient. Since then the positionappears to have improved, and there are indications of Russian advances southof Krasnograd.   The Russians are also attacking in the Bakhmut area.Crimea.21. The Russians have attacked from Sevastopol and from tihe KerchPeninsula, but the Germans claim to have repulsed these attacks.Summary.22. The main features during the past week have been the Russian success in the Sfcara Russa sector, about which information is still incomplete, thecontinued fighting in the Moscow-Smolensk sector and the heavy fighting in theDonets salient, where the Russians have had definite successes. In the Donetsarea the temperature has risen considerably; this may be either temporary or avery early spring thaw.Libya.23. During the past week, operations have been confined to active patrollingby both sides. In the course of these operations, our patrols have penetratedconsiderable distances into the areas occupied by the enemy, inflicting casualties and capturing prisoners and vehicles.Far East.Burma.24. Since the withdrawal of our Forces across the Sittang, activity has been on a reduced scale. Information received states that tihe Japanese suffered some,000 casualties out of a total of 5,000 troops engaged in the fighting for theSittang Bridge.On the 26th February, Waw (15 miles N.E. of Pegu) was attacked byDakoits, but local counter-attacks restored the situation. On the 27th the enemysucceeded in cutting the road and railway 20 miles north of Pegu, and there were indications of a large enemy concentration converging on Myitkyo.On the 2nd March an attack by tanks and one company of infantry failedat Waw. Two of our tanks were destroyed. On the 4th our infantry and tanksinflicted casualties on the enemy north-east of Pegu. Enemy columns are now reported to be converging on Pegu from the north and also on Thanetpin,south-east of Pegu.25. The normal life of Rangoon has come to a stop, but the cttrfew has caused a decrease in looting and arson of private property.26. During the week the 63rd Indian Brigade Group has arrived atRangoon. Major^General Koines has succeeded Major-General Smythe in command of the 17th Indian Division.General Wavell visited Burma on the 1st March.27. The Japanese still possess a considerable superiority in numbers, two divisions being employed on the Sittang-Pegu front, with a third division in reserve in the Moulmein area, and a fourth division either in reserve in theBangkok area or moving up to support. A fifth division is in the Chiengrai area in North Thailand ready to oppose any advance by Chinese troops from theShan States. In addition it is considered that one further division from malaya and one from Indo-China could be made available for employment on this front.[23540] . b 2

During the night of the 28th February/1st March Japanese landed at three points on the north coast of Java :-(a) In Bantam Province. At the extreme north-west corner of the island.In this area the bridge-head had been extended by the 3rd March to within 15 miles of Batavia and 10 miles from Buitenzorg.(b) Tjiasem Bay (about 60 miles east of Batavia).: In this area the enemycaptured Kalidjati aerodrome and Soebang on the 1st March.(c) Kragan (about 80 miles west of Sourabaya). Here the Japanese had crossed the Solo River, near Tjepoe, by the 3rd March, and wereadvancing south-east through Ngawi towards Tjaroeban.Allied counter-attacks have so far failed.By the 4th March, Japanese strength in these three areas was estimated at (a) Two divisions.(b) One division.(ic) Two divisions. ;/ 1130. Demolitions have been carried out at the oilfields at Tjepoe. About1,200 unarmed British Army personnel were evacuated before the Japaneseinvasion.Timor.31.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and E respectively. in combining the figures for non-tankers (which are compiled as at the end of the month) with those for tankers (which are compiled as at the 15th of the month) certainslight differences have had to be brought into a common form.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom ; in January 1942 these comprised 34 tankers of 282,000 gross tons.(b) Non.-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A substantial part (in recent months nearly one-half) of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3) ).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty-Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not&apos;therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward-vo-wages to the Fitting Services or which had previously been trading bet-ween countries other than United Kingdom and Eire.

Cologne. In the raid of the 23rd/24th December a factory making shellfuses was hit. One-third of the works was destroyed but the remainder has beenable to continue production.There have been several reports of severe damage to the I.G. Farben chemical works at Leverkusen, and these now seem to be confirmed by information receivedby the Ministry of Economic Warfare concerning a noticeable shortage of certainpharmaceutical products which -are believed to be manufactured only at these works. There seems little doubt that these important works have been damaged,but the precise date when the damage occurred is not known.2. Hamburg. The HowaldCs Werft was badly damaged during the attackon the J5th/16th September. Out of six submarines of about 500 tons which were under construction ifTThe shipyard, two are said to have been almost completely destroyed.3. Bremen. The Bremer Nachrichten has published the names of 26 peoplekilled in the raid on the 21st/22nd January on Bremen.4. Hannover. The names of 21 people killed in the raid on Hannover onthe 26th/27th January have been published in the press.5. munster. The German press has announced that the munster OperaCompany has been &quot;compelled by circumstances &quot; to give its performances in another building.   This is thought to have been the result of attacks in January.Occupied France.6. Attacks on distilleries -Photographs taken on the 16th February showthat, as the result of attacks in November and January, the alcohol distillery atLe Verton is completely inactive. Photographs taken on the 18th Februaryindicate that, as a result of attacks in November, the alcohol distillery at la Meauffe has been severely damaged and is apparently out of action.7. Attack on French armament and engineering works at Billancourt. Little information, other than that contained in pilots&apos; reports, is available atthe time of writing regarding the results of the attack on the 3rd/4th March, inwhich the Renault armament and motor works at Billancourt, a suburb of Paris,were the main objective. Pilots&apos; reports indicate, however, that considerable damage was caused, and unconfirmed reports from other sources mention severe damage to the Renault, Hispano and Forman factories, and state that the Sampsonfactory has been completely destroyed.
