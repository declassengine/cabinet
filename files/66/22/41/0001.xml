iISECRET. . ^.,;. P. (42) 111. Copy ITo. . .v$____5th March, 19U2.vfcJR CA3II-cabinet.TKEATMEITT OF PRISOH MS AT HOITG KONG.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues a draft of a statement onthis subject which might be made in Parliament by the PrimeMinister or -the Foreign Secretary.FOMEIGM OFFICE.5th Mai ch, 19h2.Draft Question:To ask . ......................................whether he is yet  in a position to make a statement regardingthe treatment  of military prisoners and civilians by the JapaneseArmy at Hong Kong after- the capitulation.Draft Answer:Yes, Sir.      Out of regard for the feelings of the thousands of relations of the victims, His Majesty&apos;s Government have been unwilling to publish any accounts of Japanese atrocities at hong Kong until these had been confirmed beyond any possibilityof doubt.      Unfortunately there is no longer room- for doubt.His Majesty&apos;s Government are now in possession of statements by reliable cyo-witnesses who succeeded in escapingfrom Hong Kong.      Their testimony establishes the fact that theJapanese Army at Hong Kong perpetrated.against their helplessmilitary prisoners and the civil population, without distinctionof race or colour, the same kind of barbarities which arouse..-the horror of the civilised world at the-time of the Hankingmassacre of 1937.It is known that fifty officers and men were bound hand\ and foot and then bayonetted to death.      It is known that ten(&apos;        days after the capitulation wounded wore still being collected&apos;/        from the hills and the Japanese were refusing permission to burythe dead.      It is known that women, both Asiatic and European,were raped and murdered and that one entire Chinese districtwas declared a brothel regardless of the status of theinhabitants.All the survivors of the garrison, British, IndianChinese and Portuguese have been herded info a camp consistingof wrecked huts without doors, windows, light or sanitation.By the end of January 150 cases of dysentery had occurred inthe camp but no drugs or medical facilities were supplied.The dead had to be buried in a comer of the camp.      TheJapanese guards are utterly callous and the repeated requestsof/

of General Maltby, the General Officer Commanding., for an interview with the Japanese commander have been curtly refused.&apos;This presumably means  that the Japanese high command haveconnived at the conduct of their forces.      The JapaneseGovernment stated at the end of February that the&apos; numbers ofprisoners in Hong Kong were British 5,072, Canadian 1,689,Indian 3,829, Others 357, Total 10, 947.Most of the European: residents&apos;,  including so e who are seriously ill, have buon interned and, like the militaryprisoners, are being given only a little rice and water andoccasional scraps of other food.The Japanese Government have refused their consent tothe visit to Hong Kong of a representative either of the protecting Powci  or of the International Red Cross Committed.They have in fact announced that they require all foreignconsuls to withdraw from all the territories they haveinvaded since the outbreak of war.      It is clear that theirtreatment of prisoners and civilians will not bear independentinvestigation-I have no information as to the conditions of our prisoners of wan and civilians in Malaya.      The only reportaviilable is a statement by the Japanese official news agency of the 3rd March stating that 77,699 Chinese have beenarrooted and subjected to what is described as &quot;a severeexamination&quot;.      It is not difficult to imagine what thatent ails.I am sorry that  I have had to make such a statement to theHouse.      Two things will be clear from it, to the House, tothe country and to the world.      The Japanese claim that their* forces are animated by a lofty.code of chivalry, Bushido, is-a nauseating hypocrisy.      Th. t&apos;is the first thing.      The second is&quot; t hat the  enemy must&apos; be utterly defeated.      The House will agree with me that we can best express our sympathy with the victims of these appalling outrages by redoubling our efforts to ensure his utter and overwhelming defeat.
