The White Paper proposals, as a permanent policy, arealready gravely imperilled. Their success depended on the Jews and the Arabsshowing themselves willing to co-operate in the government of the country.Hopes were entertained that they would gradually draw together. But, so faras the Jews at any rate are concerned, we can no longer have any illusions about this. It is clear both from the public and private utterances of the Zionist leadersthat their conception is an utterly different one from that of the White Paper.They do not want a joint Jew and Arab State. They want a purely Jewish State,and they are determined to get it, by any means in their power. That is the motive underlying the agitation for a Jewish army, which there is good reasonto suppose is to be intensified both in this country and the United States. If theArabs like to continue to live in the country, well and good. But they will haveno share in the government of the country -that will be reserved entirely forJews. We must face the fact that this is their conception, and that they will accept no other. Their outlook is, in fact, not religious or even racial, but purelynationalist. The Jewish National Home has become for them a nation like anyother nation, Britain or Germany or the United States. It is, as was stated inpamphlets distributed in Tel-Aviv on the 28th February, their &quot;Fatherland.&quot;Sooner or later we shall have to have a show-down with them -we shall eitherhave to reject their conception, or we shall have to accept it. In either case, weshall have a row, in the one with the Jewish, in the other with the Moslem, world.But equally clearly the time for that is not now. At the present moment wecannot afford to quarrel with anyone. It therefore seems essential that we shouldnot at present take any steps which might be interpreted as an abandonment ofthe White Paper policy. If we lose the war, it will not be we who have to tackle the problem. If we win it, we may be in a better position to impose our will,either against Jew or Arab, or both. But to begin, while the issue is stillundecided, to tinker with the White Paper policy, to suggest modifications hereor there, or, still more, to scrap it and start afresh, would lay us open to new andincalculable dangers.2. For the time being, then, I suggest that the White Paper must stand,and we may take it that this position will, so long as the war lasts, be acquiesced in by the Arabs and not pjpenly challenged by the Jews. The only question thatfaces us immediately is whether, while maintaining the broad principles of thepolicy, there are any modifications which could usefully be made in its practical application. This arises in an acute form over the problem of illegal immigra-tion into Palestine, and in particular over the loss of the Struma.The White Paper lays down that &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined to check illegal immigration, and further preventive measures arebeing adopted.  The numbers of any Jewish illegal immigrants who, despite these[23529]
measures, may succeed in coming into the country and cannot be deported will be deducted from the yearly quota.&quot; In fact, His Majesty&apos;s Government have notbeen particularly successful in stopping illegal immigration. Out of the 35,000immigrants who have entered Palestine since the adoption of the policy of theWhite Paper, some 18,000, or more than half, have been illegal. During the lastyear, it is true, more effective efforts have been made to check the flow, and, withthe entry of Italy into the war and its consequent extension to the Mediter-ranean, a new situation arose which made it more practicable to tighten up thecontrol of&quot; illegal immigration. The waters of that sea and of the ^aegean becamedangerous for shipping, and only the most desperate of the immigrants from europe were willing to run the risks involved. That fact has provided an automatic control.3. But a small number of ships have continued to run from European ports in countries in the occupation of the enemy. In war time this traffic has provided the Palestinian authorities with an entirely new problem, that of security; for it is clear that illegal immigrants coming in war time from enemy-occupied countries, certainly with the connivance and possibly with the blessing of theenemy, cannot be regarded in quite the same way as ordinary illegal immigrantsin peace time. Most strenuous efforts have therefore been made to discourage the traffic, partly by imposing heavy penalties on the owners and masters of shipsconcerned in it, and partly by removing the incentive of the immigrants to comeby deporting to Mauritius those who succeeded in reaching Palestine. an exception to this policy was, it is true, made, as a special act of clemency, in thecase of the Jewish refugees who were on board the Patria when it sank in HaifaHarbour in November 1940, but it was then publicly stated here, and in Palestine,that thereafter all illegal immigrants attempting to enter Palestine would bedirected to Mauritius or elsewhere. It has not been possible to deport passengersfrom another boat, the s.s. Darien, owing to shipping difficulties : the immigrants from this ship have now been in detention for nearly a year. These measuresachieved considerable success. The traffic did, in fact, dwindle almost to nothing.But lately there have been signs that it is starting again. In particular, therehas been the case of the Struma, whose unlucky attempt to run the gauntlet hasled to a disaster which has greatly shocked public opinion both in this country andthe United States.4. This ship, a converted yacht of about 200 tons, flying the Panamanianflag, left Constanza in October with some 760 Jews on board, with the object of effecting their illegal entry into Palestine. She was reported to have reachedIstanbul about the middle of December, and thereafter considerable engine repairshad to be effected : the vessel was described as a mere hulk, and badly overcrowded.It was made clear to the Turkish authorities that the passengers on board couldnot be admitted to Palestine. Subsequently the Palestine Government offered to admit the children between the ages of 11 and 16, but the Turks declined to allow them to travel overland. Our impression was that the negotiations were still proceeding when reports appeared in the press on the 25th February that theTurks had had the vessel towed out and that she had sunk in the Black Sea after an explosion with the loss of nearly all on board.5. It is certain that the fate of the Struma will lead to renewed pressure onHisMajesty&apos;s Government, both by Jews and pro-Jews and by purely humanitarianpersons, to modify the present ban on illegal immigration, and the question arises,what answer shall be given. The matter is of some urgency. Already, thequestion has been raised in the House of Lords by Lord Wedgwood, and, in a personal interview with me, by Dr. Weizmann. And next week there is to be a debate in the House of Lords on a motion by Lord Davies on Palestine, in thecourse of which the matter is certain to be further discussed. I should be glad of a decision by the Cabinet as to what reply should be given.8.   There seem to be two practicable alternatives: (1) We can stand pat on our present position, and refuse to budge. In that case, presumably we should base our refusal on three grounds, (a) ourpast policy and pronouncements, (&amp;) considerations of security, and(c) the danger of stimulating a traffic which is being encouraged by theenemy to embarrass us, and might get beyond all bounds. So far as thequestion of security is concerned, it is obvious that the departure of
emigrant ships from South-East Europe is only made possible by enemy connivance, and so offers unusual opportunities for theinfiltration of Axis agents. The Cabinet should know that thePalestine Government have definite evidence that earlier departureswere actually organised by the Gestapo and that Gestapo agents were on board the Struma. The military authorities in Palestine have always been seriously concerned over this aspect of the traffic.(2) We could agree to admit illegal immigrants, so long as their numberswere deducted from the annual quota, and so long as under no circumstances did they exceed that quota. This would represent aclimb down from the position which His Majesty&apos;s Government tookup at the time of the Patria incident, when we made a public state-ment to the effect that no further exception would be made to thegeneral rule. It would be most unpopular with the Arabs, and mightprofoundly affect our authority and prestige in the Middle East. Onthe other hand, it could no doubt be defended on grounds of humanity,and by a firm declaration that the numbers of such refugees would be deducted from the annual quota and that, to that extent, it did not represent a contravention of the provision regarding illegal immigration in the White Paper.7. Which of these alternatives is preferable it is for the Cabinet to decide.My own preference, after careful consideration, inclines slightly to the second.The fate of those miserable people who do succeed in leaving enemy countries is so terrible, if we refuse them entry into Palestine, that I cannot feel that it is right to abandon them in their extremity. Moreover, the Jewish Agency have themselves publicly declared that they would be willing that such refugees shouldbe deducted from the yearly quota. On the other hand, we must not leave out of account the very real considerations of security and the economic absorptive capacity of Palestine. I suggest, therefore, that we should agree to admit to palestine those illegal immigrants who are fleeing from enemy oppression, subjectto three conditions : (1) Their numbers must under no circumstances exceed the annual quota forthe years(2) They must be unobjectionable from the security point of view.(3) They must be acceptable from the point of view of the economicabsorptive capacity of the country.What would in effect happen would be this. A shipload of immigrants would arrive at a Palestinian port, and would immediately be put into a detentioncamp. While there, each immigrant would be subject to close scrutiny by thePalestine authorities on security grounds, and a decision would be reached, inconsultation with the Jewish Agency, on the application of the principle ofeconomic absorptive capacity to each of them. Those who passed through thesetwo sieves would be admitted to the country the remainder would be taken else-where, to Mauritius or wherever it might be. In practice, of course, nearly allthe immigrants would be admitted, for the Jewish Agency would see that jobswere available for them. But the fact that we were maintaining the main pro-visions of the White Paper might be used as an argument to rebut subsequentArab criticism.8. If it should be decided to adopt this course, it would, I suggest, be advis-able to make an announcement on the following lines :  His Majesty&apos;s Government remain strongly opposed to illegal immigra-tion into Palestine. They confirm the provisions of the White Paper of 1939.But the development of the war has rendered inevitable some modificationof the practical application of these provisions in regard to refugees from enemy persecution who may make their way into Palestine. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have decided that, at any rate for the present, immigrants from enemy countries, although they may not have gone through the necessaryformalities to legalise their entry, will be treated as follows : On arrival inPalestine they will be placed in a detention camp, where they will be subjectto close scrutiny from the security point of view. All those as to whom thePalestine Government are satisfied will be admitted as immigrants against
the annual quotas, subject to the normal criterion of the economic absorptive capacity of the country. This decision will cover the passengers from thes.s. Darien, who have been detained1 in Palestine since March 1941; and atthe end of the war the case of those who were removed to Mauritius will befurther considered with a view to their admittance to Palestine, if circum-stances permit. The legislation imposing penalties on the owners androasters of vessels concerned in the traffic in illegal immigration will not be modified.9. I fully realise the strong arguments that may be advanced against Jmaking any such departure from previous policy, but I feel bound to submit thesetentative proposals to my colleagues. If they consider that they are Worthfurther examination, it would, of course, be necessary to obtain the views of theHigh Commissioner, in consultation with the General Officer Commanding NinthArmy, before a definite decision could be taken.C.Colonial Office, March 4, 1942.3
