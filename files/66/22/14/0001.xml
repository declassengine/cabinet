THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1942.SECRET. Copy No.     g \W.P. (42) 84.February 15, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.AIR SERVICES TO THE MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.IN W.P. (42) 40 the ad hoc Committee on Air Services to the Middle Eastrecommended by a majority of 3 to 2 that sufficient aircraft should be diverted from operational duties to increase the weekly average pay-load by air transport to the Middle East to some 23,000 lb. The Admiralty and. the Air Ministrydissented from this view. In W.P. (42) 65 the Secretary of State for War asks for an additional increase of 5,000 lb. per week for certain Army requirements,making a total demand of 28,000 lb. per week.2. Since W.P. (42) 40 and W.P. (42) 65 were circulated, certain changes have been made, and the table set out on page 2 of W.P. (42) 40 givingthe estimated weekly aircraft capacity on the Middle East route should now read as follows : lb.(a) Direct to Egypt (5 Liberators)    ...      ...      ...      3,500(b) Through the Mediterranean :Catalina and Guba (to Malta only)    ...      ...      3,000(c) Via West Africa :3 Boeings ................      6,200*3 S. 30s...............      ...      1,70014,400It is hoped, later on, to operate the two G boats over the West African route,in which case the weekly average might be further increased by 1,800 lb. this must be regarded as a very approximate estimate, as the G boats have not yet-been operated beyond Lisbon, and they will need to be re-engined before they canfly the long stretch to Bathurst. The above total, however, approximates to the requirement of 14,660 lb. a week for Troop Mails, Government Mails and passengers, and urgent freight.3. The basis of the requests for an increase in capacity put forward in w.P. (42) 40 and W.P. (42) 65 is as follows :-(a) The increase by 9,000 lb. a week to 23,000 lb. a week asked for by themajority of the ad hoc Committee is for the purpose of carrying civilmails. Present capacity permits the carriage weekly, in addition toGovernment Mails, of 1,200 lb. of service postcards, and 160 lb. ofairgraph letters for the forces in the Middle East.  This gives a total* The figure for these boats quoted in W.P. (42) 40 was 3,85b. The increase showndepends on technical improvements now being applied.[23469]
of 206,500 postcards and 335,000 airgraph letters a week. It is submitted that this is a reasonable provision for the needs of theForces, and that it would not be appropriate at present to restorenormal civil air mail services to the Middle East at the cost of the diversion of operational aircraft as explained below.(&amp;) The additional increase of 5,000 lb. asked for by the Secretary of Statefor War is intended exclusively for tJhe following Army purposes  (i) The rapid passage of officers between home and overseas theatres;(ii) The return of a limited number of personnel from Middle Easton leave;(iii) Urgent freight amounting to 2,500 lb. per week.4.   On these points it may be said : (a) The rapid exchange of officers is admittedly desirable.   The essentialminimum is, however, provided by present and projected services, andthere can be no possibility of meeting the full demand now or in thefuture without an extravagant diversion of aircraft from operations.(b) It is most questionable whether the effect on morale would in fact be good if the special privilege of return to England by air was extendedto a negligible minority of those who have spent several years overseas.This problem is surely one which must be dealt with on a much more serious scale by the systematic arrangement of reliefs, using the normalsea routes.(c) The average load carried for the Army in the Middle East, by civil andR.A.F. aircraft, has amounted to 2,000 lb. a week over the last four months. This level can be maintained. It is, however, important that air transport should not come to be regarded as a normal meansof conveying stores to tihe Middle East. This function can never be adequately met by air transport, and it is most undesirable thatexcessive reliance should be placed on it.5.   There are three possible air routes to Egypt: (a) Direct flight;(b) The Mediterranean route; and(c) The West African route.The implications of the full increase in capacity asked for considered in relationto these routes are as follows : 16. Direct route to Egypt. With the present military situation in Libyathe only aircraft capable of undertaking the direct flight is the Liberator I.*Weather conditions over this long flight by night are uncertain and regularityof operation cannot be expected. Subject to tJhis difficulty, the additional14,000 lb. weekly would require the provision of 18 additional Liberator I&apos;s.Other than those already operating on the direct service, there are only sevenLiberator I&apos;s in this country, and all are employed in Coastal Command. Theyare required in the Battle of the Atlantic.7. If Cyrenaica were recovered and it again became possible to operateheavy transport aircraft from aerodromes in the El Adem area, the Halifax orStirling could be used. Owing to its smaller pay-load, about 32 aircraft of this type would be required. At present, however, these aircraft must be ruled out as they cannot carry any pay-load at the necessary range.8. The Mediterranean route. This is practicable only for flying boats, astake-off conditions at Gibraltar limit the pay-load of land planes to 100 lb.9. The operation of flying boats over the route would necessitate a directflight from Gibraltar to Egypt, as severe losses of aircraft and an undue drain on the resources of the island would be inevitable if Malta were used as a stagingpoint. In these circumstances only the Catalinas would meet requirements, andto ferry an additional 14,000 lb. of freight weekly some 15 aircraft would be* The Catalina, owing to its slow speed, cannot traverse the dangerous areas by night.
necessary. As we are far from meeting our minimum requirements in flying boats in the Battle of the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean and the Far East, a diversion of this order cannot be contemplated.10. The West Africa route. This route may be considered under twoheadings : United Kingdom-West Africa, and west Africa-Middle East.Over the latter portion of the route there is already capacity for 31,000 lb.per week, which may be expected to increase by the end of March to some45,000 lb.   The difficulty is concentrated in the section between the UnitedKingdom and West Africa, which involves a non-stop flight between Lisbon orGibraltar and Bathurst.   The Sunderland could make this flight in favourable weather, but the pay-load would be negligible.   So far as converted militaryj aircraft are concerned, it can therefore only be done by Catalinas, Liberators,LHalifaxes or Stirlings.   The numbers required would probably be somewhat1 larger than on the direct route to the Middle East.   The provision of these aircraft could only be made at the expense of Bomber Command or the middle east in the case of the land planes, or of our resources for General Reconnaissanceat home and abroad, in the case of the flying boats.Conclusion.11. I submit that no case has been made out for the diversion from tradeprotection and from our bombing effort of operational aircraft in the numbers required; and that the best method of dealing with the requirements stated is toimprove tlhe arrangement for fast sea transport to West Africa, whence mail,freight and passengers can be sent forward by air with far less strain on ourlimited resources of long-range aircraft.A.
