The summarycontains points of considerable interest.(Signed)    HANKEY.PAYMASTER GENERAL&apos;S office,Privy Council Office,Whitehall,  S.W.I.25TH FEBRUARY,   1942,Visit of the Oil Denial Mission to theNorthern CaucasusnAt an interview with Ms  Stalin on 21st July,  1941,H.M. Ambassador at Moscow offered the assistance of Britishexperts in preparing and carrying out plans to prevent theGermans from benefiting from Soviet oil resources in theCaucasus if they succeeded in forcing their way there.      ;M. S,talin at the time regarded the suggestion as premature.On the 21st November, after the Russian evacuation ofKerch, Sir Stafford.Cripps renewed his offer and,  at the sametime communicated to the Soviet Government the assurances, uponwhich the British and American Governments had in the meantimeagreed, as to assistance to be given to the Soviet Governmentin respect of supplies of oil and oil equipment during the warand the period of postwar reconstruction if,  as a result of thedestruction of the Caucasian oilfields,  such assistance became necessary.

2. On the following day,  22nd November,  the ambassador was informed that the Soviet Government accepted the offer to send oil experts.to the Caucasus and desired that they should arrive as soon as possible.      Accordingly, the Mission leftCairo for Teheran on 26th November,  and on the 30th november was flown to Baku in a Soviet Plane.      Prom there,  they wentby train to Krasnodar,  arriving on the 4th December, and onthe following days discussed plans with General Merkulov,Deputy Chief of the N.K.V.D.   (Ogpu), who had charge of the denial schemes, M. Sedin, all Union Commissar for Petroleum,and other Soviet officials.      The following paragraphs givea summary of the report by Mr. W.L. Porster,  a technicalmember of the -Mission.3, It was evident that the Soviet officials were wellversed in the technical details of demolition problems.      they intended to strip everything,   if time permitted,  inqluding theentire refinery plant and equipment,  all oilfield plant and installations and all pipelines, the materials being transportedfrom the area as fast as they were dismantled.      Destructionon the spot would only be necessary in case the situation deteriorated before evacuation was complete.      As for thewells,  the plan was to shut them down and pull out the tubing.Cement plugs were to be set in the holes and,  in case ofemergency,  it would only be necessary to drop steel on the top of the plugs to render the wells beyond repair or to setexplosives in the holes.4. On the 7th December,, the Mission were given anopportunity of judging for themselves the efficacy of theRussian plans.      They visited the Krasnodar refinery,  a plantwith a capacity of about 1 million tons a year.      About 5Cfo ofthe entire plant had been dismantled after some eight days&apos;work and further operations were proceeding rapidly..     Thegreater part of the material had been evacuated,  all partsbeing clearly numbered for identification on later re-erection.The number of men employed was comparatively small but all wereactively engaged and worked smoothly on a well-planned, scheme.As an instance of the thoroughness of the scheme, even under-ground electric cables and pipelines were dismantled for evacuation and use elsewhere while empty buildings,  remainingafter-removal of the plant, were to be destroyed.      The. party on the way from Baku to Krasnodar had noticed many train loadsof oil equipment going south.5, On the 9th December,  the Mission visited some of the oilfields in the Maikop area.      The power station and even thesmoke.stacks had been dismantled and largely removed.      In theprevious six days,  some 85 kilometres of pipelines had beendismantled, the pipes being cut into sections for removal.Prom the wells,  tubing and rods had been removed and material for plugging was ready on the spot.
