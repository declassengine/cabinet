this DOCUMSIT IS THE PROPERTY 0? HE BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 S GOVERTCDDNTgSECRET,(.^.116March 1942.TO^JSPT UKDBR LOOK .AND jISYIt is. requested ;&apos;that special care may betaken to ensure the secrecy of this document yf7rAR   cabinet copy No.    /7-E-pjA Pa,ICYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for IridjLaI circulate herewith for consideration by the Uar Cabinet the draft of atelegram to the Viceroy, in the form approved by the Committee on India.INDIA OFFICE.1. Obviously there are many questions to which it will be necessary for you to be prepared to give at any rate some sort of answer as well as matters on whichit is of the greatest importance that guidance should be given beforehand to yourExecutive Council, Provincial Governors and others most affected, including thePress.      I agree (vide your telegram - of the 3rd March, 502-S&quot;: that, full text of delclaration should be available to you and your Council shortly before its issue and I will arrange accordingly.2.        The prospect of a new Constitution for India may cause anxiety to Nepal.It may be well to assure the Maharajah of Nepal that his Treaty with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will hold good? subject to revision by negotiation..     Control ofNepalese troops will not be transferred to the new Indian Union.5.        As regards the Princes our treaties with them hold good, subject to revision by negotiation.      If they consider joining a federation whether the mainUnion or&apos;a Pakistan one they are fully entitled to. stipulate that they only do soon the express condition that it remains under the Crown.      If they stay out weshall naturally fulfil our obligation:..- to ensure their protection.4-. As regards the Army it is essential that senior officers should be instructed to make it&apos;quite clear to all subordinates that nothing is happening&apos;: , now/

now that affects their position as the Eing JSniperor1 s troops and that if andwhen a constitutional change docs take place in the future their personal rightswill be safeguarded in every respect.     This should be immediately conmunicatcdfto troops in Middle East and other stations outside India.5. Similar assurances should be given through Governors to the Services(&apos; roteetod under the pre sent Government of India Act.6. Paragraph (c)(i).     The main argument for this is that it substantiallyfulfils our pledge to the Moslems and yet enables the other Provinces to getahead.     The awkward boundary questions raised may ultimately be resolved byreadjustment;    whether by the constitutional Convention, by negotiation,arbitration or referendum, can be left open for the present.     The Provinceswhose legislatures &quot;may exercise a right of non-accession are the Provinces asthey now exist.7. Paragraph (c)  &quot;lines analogous;I means that if say the three Northwestern Provinces stand out they can hold their own convention, together withsuch States as might wish to adhere to them, frame their own DominionConstitution, unitary or federal, and have it accepted subject to a treatycorresponding to that in (c)(ii).     The same might apply to Bengal.     But ofcourse v/e do not envisage a multitude of Dominions.8. The treaty will obviously cover our obligations to States, to minorities,end to existing personnel of Services.      It will cover whatever arrangements theConvention may make in agreement with His Majesty&apos;s Government for thecontinuance of assistance in the shape of British Armed Porces but as in thecase of the other Dominions any British Troops lent would be for the purposes of external defence and not for the maintenance of internal security except withour consent.     This would probably be for a period of years subject after thatto notice for some agreed period.     You are authorised to say that we shall not make stipulations for the future of British commercial interests in India, in thepre-acceptance treaty, but leave them for negotiation after the new Governmenthas come into existence. t

9. You va.ll appreciate that it is our hope that Indians will devise theirown constitution-making body.     But to avoid t le reproach that we are relying- their disagreement, we arc now setting out the procedure we should adopt\to set up a constitutional Convention, failing agreement among Indians.10.       Paragraph (e) .     You are authorised to negotiate vrith the leaders ofohe principa.1 sections of Indian opinion on the basis of this paragraph forthe purpose of obtaining their immediate support for some scheme by which theycan partake in an advisory or consultative- manner in the counsels of theircountry.     This does not preclude your offering them if you consider it viseor necessary position in&quot; your Executive Council provided this does notembarrass you in the defence and good government of the country during thepresent critical time.     Similarly if there is evidence of real willingness to co-operate you could offer representation as members of your Executiveat v7ar Cabinet and at Peace Conference.
