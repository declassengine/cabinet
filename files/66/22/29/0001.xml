(42) 99.Copy No.  21February 24, 1942.WAR CABINET.REGIONAL UNDERSTANDINGS :   BELGIUM, THE netherlands and LUXEMBURG.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Belgian Government, who informed us a year ago that the &quot; poiitiqued&apos;independance &quot;was dead and would not be revived after the war, have recentlyraised the. question of closer relationship between Belgium and the Netherlands.M. Spaak has enquired our views in the matter, and has specifically asked whether we should look with favour upon an agreement between Belgium, the netherlands and Luxemburg with the object of co-ordinating more closely the foreign, militaryand economic policies of the three countries.2.. In view of the general attitude which we have adopted towards plans for a closer union between groups of the smaller countries in Europe, I do not want to discourage the Belgians. But to talk in terms of confederation or of federal union is not very profitable in dealing with the problem of the low countries. Both Belgium and the Netherlands are deeply attached to their RoyalHouses. Nor is. a Netherland-Belgian association easily conceivable without thesupport and participation of ourselves. The Belgians have already expressed their wish to be very closely associated militarily and economically with theBritish Commonwealth after the war, and we may, indeed, be wise to aim at ageneral agreement for mutual defence with Belgium, the Netherlands andLuxemburg. This would have to include the close co-ordination of foreign andeconomic policy as well.3. There are many difficulties, and I should not propose to ventilate theidea before we have fixed the main lines of Anglo-United States economic policy and the tide of war turns in our favour. Meanwhile, I am inclined to let the Belgian Government know that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be disposed&quot; to look with favour upon an agreement between Belgium, theNetherlands and Luxemburg of the kind proposed, without giving the impression that we are too enthusiastic about the proposal as it stands. If this course is approved, I would propose to send instructions to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to belgium in this sense.A. E.Foreign Office, February 24, 1942.11654:  [23501]
