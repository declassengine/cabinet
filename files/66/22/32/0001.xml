SECRET. Copy No.   21-----W.P. (42) 102. ^February 27, 1942.WAR CABINET.THE MILLING RATIO.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.IN accordance with the War Cabinet decision of the 19th February(W.M. (42) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 1), the Lord Presidents Committee have considered what steps could be taken to mitigate the effects on food productionin this country of the loss of wheat offals resulting from the proposed raising ofthe rate of extraction of flour from wheat.2. If the milling ratio were raised on the 1st April next (the earliest datenow administratively practicable), and if the rations of animal feeding-stuffscontinued to be distributed on the present basis, there would during the periodMay-September be a deficiency of feeding-stuffs equal to 115,000 tons of wheatoffals.- This deficiency could be met by the provision of maize. The feeding valueof maize exceeds that&apos;of wheat offals in the proportion of 4 : 3. The deficiency of 115,000 tons of wheat offals could therefore be met by the provision of87,000 tons of maize.Under the rationing scheme, coupons for all cereal feeding-stuffs havehitherto been interchangeable; and there would be considerable administrative difficulties in introducing an element of differentiation by which a farmerentitled to 4 tons of cereal feeding-stuffs would receive only 3 tons if he tookhis ration in the form of maize. We understand, however, that these difficulties are not insuperable; and we consider that maize should be substituted for wheatoffals, not on a ton for ton basis, but in the ratio of 3 : 4, which takes account ofthe higher feeding value of maize.3. If 87,000 tons of maize could be made available to agriculture duringthe period May-September, the milling ratio could be increased without anyadverse effect on home production during that period the dairy herd would notbe endangered and the numbers of pigs and hens could be maintained.At this stage it is not thought practicable to look further ahead than theend of September. If the harvest is good, the increased acreage under cropsdesigned for animal feeding-stuffs may go far to make good the loss of wheatoffals. The position in the year 1942-43 must be reviewed again when the resultsof the harvest are known.4. The Ministry of Food hold a stock of 100,000 tons of maize as a milk production reserve. It is agreed that the maize required to maintain the feeding-stuffs rations during the early summer months might be taken from this reserve(to the amount of about 52,000 tons) if an assurance could be given that the wholeof the 87,000 tons required would be imported by the end of the summer, so thatthe reserve stock could be built up again to its present level by the end ofSeptember.[23514]Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1942.
5. By raising the milling ratio to 85 per cent, on the 1st April, we should secure a gross saving in shipping space of 300,000 tons during the six months tothe end of September. Against this the proposal outlined above involves theimportation of an additional 87,000 tons of maize, which need not be brought inuntil the end of that period. By this means we could secure a net saving in tonnage of 213,000 tons, without any adverse effect on home food production.6. If the War Cabinet consider that the shipping prospects are such as to,enable a definite assurance to be given that an additional 87,000 tons of maizewill be imported before the end of September, we recommend that (a) The milling ratio should be raised to 85 per cent, on the 1st April;(b) The consequent loss of wheat offals should be met during the period upto the end of September by adding 87,000 tons of maize to the cerealfeeding-stuffs available for distribution under the rationing scheme;(c) This maize should be drawn in the early summer months from the maizereserve held by the Ministry of Food, on the understanding that87,000 tons of maize will be imported towards the end of the summer,so that the reserve may be restored to its present level by the end ofSeptember.J. A.Great George Street, S.W. 1,February 27, 1942.
