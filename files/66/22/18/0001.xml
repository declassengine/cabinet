Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1942.SECRET.Copy Wo. 31W.P. (42) 88.February 16, 1942.WAR CABINET.THE MILLING RATIO.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.IN view of our increasing need of shipping for military purposes, we shouldexplore every practicable means of economising in the shipping used for imports to meet civilian requirements.With this in view, the Lord Presidents Committee have been considering whether the rate of extraction of flour from wheat should not now be raised from76 per cent, (white bread) to 85 per cent, (wheat meal bread).If the milling ratio were raised to 85 per cent., wheat imports could bereduced by 600,000 tons a year. There would be a corresponding loss of wheatoffals; and this might necessitate some increase of imports, either of maize orother grain for animal feeding-stuffs, or of bacon and eggs. It is likely, however,that the net economy in shipping space resulting from this change in the millingratio would be not less than 400,000 tons a year.2. Erom the milling point of view, there will be no practical difficulty in raising the extraction rate. The millers can introduce the change at 14 days&apos;notice; and it will be possible to produce wheat meal bread which is palatableand uniform in nutritional quality throughout the country., There will be localvariations in the colour and texture of the bread, but these will be so small as not to be noticeable to the householder.wheat meal flour keeps less well than white: but this disadvantage can bemet by arranging for stocks of flour to be turned over more frequently.The wheat meal loaf also keeps less well than the white loaf. The Ministerof Food has, however, been assured that the wheat meal loaf will keep in good condition for three days : and, for the vast bulk of the population, there is no need to keep a loaf for longer.3. Some members of the Lord Presidents Committee have been concernedlest the wheat meal loaf should prove lastingly unpopular, particularly with theworkers. But the majority of the Committee feel that, while the public will notbe induced to welcome this bread by being told that it is better for them, theyare likely to accept it with a good grace if it is made clear that the change hasbeen made with a view to freeing shipping for military purposes.4. The shipping shortage will, be acute during the next few months, andthe future prospects are uncertain. The great advantage of raising the millingratio is that, apart from a substantial immediate economy in shipping space, itwill give us a valuable measure of flexibility at a later stage. If more tonnagebecomes available, we can import feeding-stuffs with which to maintain our pigs and poultry : if the shipping shortage continues, we can make good the deficiencyon home production by importing bacon and eggs.[23477]
25. In these circumstances the majority view of the Lord presidents committee is that the milling ratio should be raised to 85 per cent, at the earliestconvenient moment, which will probably be found to be the 16th March next.If the War Cabinet approve this change in principle, I suggest that theAgricultural Ministers should be asked to consider, and report to the lord presidents Committee, what steps can be taken to mitigate the effects on foodproduction in this country of the consequent loss of wheat offals, on the under-standing that no part of this loss should fall on the dairy herd.J. A.Great George Street, S.W. 1,February 16, 1942.
