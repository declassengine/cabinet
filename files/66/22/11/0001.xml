THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1942.SECRET. / Copy No.W.P. (42) 81.February 14, 1942.WAR CABINET.RECIPROCAL EXCHANGE OF BRITISH AND JAPANESEOFFICIALS.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN connexion with the negotiations for the reciprocal exchange of Britishand Japanese officials and nationals, an important point has arisen which requiresan urgent Cabinet decision, namely, the inclusion or non-inclusion of persons in hong Kong and other territories occupied by the Japanese since the opening ofhostilities..2. The Japanese have made proposals to the United States and ourselvesproviding for the exchange at Lourenco Marques of the following categories ofpersons : &apos;(a) officials of every kind attached to Embassies, Legations and Consulatesand their families;(b) non-permanent residents;(c) women and children among permanent residents.These categories would include officials and nationals of the Allies as well asthose of the United States and the British Empire, but they are limited to personsin Japan, Manchukuo and occupied China.3. The United States Government, who have asked His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to co-ordinate arrangements with them, have already made considerable progress towards agreement with the Japanese Government. On our side, theproblem is a wider one owing to the necessity of co-ordinating arrangementsthroughout the Empire and with the Allies (other than the Central and south american countries which fall to the United States to arrange). No reply has yet been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government tp the Japanese proposals, the finalversion of which was received from the Swiss Legation on the 21st January.4. The Foreign Office have proposed a draft reply for communication to theJapanese Government subject to there being no incompatibility with United.States arrangements.  The principal features of the draft reply were :-(a) The arrangements should cover British officials and other nationals in indo-China and Siam (and also the Philippines, since the Japanese had agreed to the evacuation of United States Consular officials from hong Kong.  But see paragraph 10 below.).(b) That all non-officials who desired to be repatriated should be allowed toleave.(c) That, if shipping facilities were insufficient to permit the entire exchangein one operation, the first stage should be an evacuation of the officials.(British and Allied officials would number about 600.)5. At an interdepartmental meeting held to consider this draft reply, theColonial Office proposed the inclusion of officials and others in the British terri-tories lately captured by the Japanese.6. This proposal alters the whole character of the scheme as conceived uptill now. It would mean an addition (exclusive of those at Singapore) of some,500 officials from territories scattered throughout the area of active hostilities,while the number of non-official persons who would wish to be repatriated cannotbe estimated.7.   It is impossible not to sympathise with the desire of the Colonial Officeto obtain the release of these additional persons.   Under international law,however, we have no right to claim their release.   The Japanese have made an11641   [23466]..................................................................... ..... !
-2offer which, according to their lights, is comparatively generous in that it includesofficials in occupied China. They have, in fact, drawn a distinction betweenterritory which was theirs before the war and territory which they have nowcaptured, and there is no likelihood of obtaining their assent to more than this,particularly as there is no quid pro quo which can be offered to them for this very wide extension of the original proposals. It is already the case that british officials and non-permanent residents in Japan and Japanese-occupied Chinaconsiderably outnumber Japanese officials and non-permanent residents in theBritish Empire and the Japanese are not interested in evacuating their permanentresidents in Canada and the United States. If I had thought that we should be no worse off by putting forward this proposal and having it refused by the Japanese,I should not have hesitated to put it forward. But, so far as it is possible tobe certain over these things, I am sure that the effect of linking to the original scheme a proposal for the evacuation of officials and others from the territories which we have lost to Japan, would be at best to produce indefinite delay andwe should run the risk of wrecking completely the possibility of evacuating those persons already covered by the Japanese proposals.8. There are other arguments against the proposals. If colonial territories are to be covered, we cannot omit the occupied portions of Burma and New Guinea(Australian) and, if the Netherlands Government so wish, the occupied portionsdf the Netherlands East Indies. It would also raise the problem of racial discrimination, e.g., against those of Chinese race (the figure of 1,500 officialsgiven in paragraph 6 above includes only white officials and their families). Apartfrom possible difficulties with the Chinese Government, the question arises,therefore, whether the operation would in any case be immediately practicable,having regard especially to the present war position and shipping difficulties.Nor must we forget that other countries, notably the United States, are sharingin the scheme, and that the complications and delays likely to be caused by anattempt to extend it to British colonial officials and residents may well produceresentment on the part of these countries and may, in fact, result in the UnitedStates proceeding independently. This might weaken our collective bargaining power and deprive us of American assistance in solving the shipping problem.9. The latest news of the treatment of our fellow-countrymen in Hong Kongmakes the decision a difficult one to take. We must obviously do everything wecan to secure the evacuation of our nationals from that and any other territoryoccupied by the Japanese.   After very careful consideration of the difficulties involved, I am convinced that we shall not succeed if we attempt to link up this problem with the present Japanese proposals. The reply to these proposalsprepared in the Foreign Office was based on as nice a calculation as possible ofwhat we can reasonably hope to obtain from the Japanese.10. I suggest that the evacuation of colonial officials and communitiesshould be taken up at once, but independently, through the international red cross or through the Argentine Government, or both. For my part, I would beready to agree that the handful of British diplomatic and consular persons caughtin Hong Kong at the outbreak of war and the British community in the philippines should be dealt with in the same approach. Such an approach, tohave the greatest chance of success, should be confined to women, children, sickpersons and males of non-military age. In making the approach it would bedesirable to recognise (1) that it would be in the nature of an appeal ad misericordiam;(2) that no differentiation of status is likely to be recognised by the JapaneseGovernment between colonial officials and colonial communities forthis purpose;(3) that for us to propose racial discrimination would be unwise;(4) that the Japanese Government are particularly Unlikely to agree to therelease of males of military age.11. My recommendation, therefore, is that the reply to the Japaneseproposals should be generally on the lines originally suggested by the ForeignOffice (see paragraph 4 above), and that the problem of colonial officials andcommunities should be taken up through the International Red Cross and theArgentine Government on the lines proposed in paragraph 10 above.A.
