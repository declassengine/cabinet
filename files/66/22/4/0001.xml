General Review.1. The Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen have left Brest steamingup Channel.A U-Boat has been sunk in the Adriatic.H.M. Destroyer Maori has been sunk at Malta.Shipping losses, primarily due to U-Boats, have been moderate.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. At 1105 on the 12th the Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen were reported off Le Touquet steaming up Channel. Light naval forces and all available aircraft were ordered to attack. Further details will be included innext week&apos;s Resume.On the 5th H.M. Sloop Jason, escorting an East Coast convoy, was slightly damaged by aircraft, one of which was destroyed by the s.s. Highwear. On thefollowing afternoon H.M. Destroyer Leeds and H.M. Corvette Puffin respectivelyclaim to have damaged a Dornier 215 and a Dornier 217, which had unsuccessfully attacked another convoy off the East Coast.H.M. Corvette Arbutus and H.M. Canadian Corvette Spikenard were torpedoed and sunk in the North-Western Approaches on the nights of the5th/6th and 10th/ 11th respectively. Thirty-nine survivors were rescued fromArbutus and eight from Spikenard.The Free French Corvette A lysse was torpedoed 425 miles east of Cape Raceon the&apos;evening of the 8th, and is returning to St. John&apos;s, Newfoundland, in tow.H.M. Minelayer Adventure was damaged in collision off the West Coast.7,500 tons of enemy shipping have been seriously damaged by our aircraft.Details are given in the Air Situation.Mediterranean.3. H.M. Submarine Thorn, on return from patrol in the Adriatic, reportedthat she had sunk a merchant ship and a U-Boat.H.M. Submarine Proteus was damaged in collision with an enemy destroyerwhich she had unsuccessfully attacked off Argostoli. H.M.S. Cleopatra, on passage to Malta, was damaged by aircraft north-east of Algiers. Six ratingswere killed and four were wounded. H.M. Destroyer Maori was bombed and sunk in Malta Harbour. H.M. Destroyer Famdale was damaged by a bomb offthe Libyan coast and is returning in tow to Alexandria.During the week 6,600 tons of enemy shipping have been destroyed or seriously damaged by our aircraft.   Details are given in the Air Situation.In the period under review 19,211 tons of French merchant shipping east-bound and 19,175 tons westbound have passed the Straits of Gibraltar underescort.East Indies.4. H.M.S. Laomedon (Boom Carrier) was torpedoed by a U-Boat 60 miles south-east of Ceylon and has returned in tow to Colombo.Far East.5. The American Cruisers Marblehead and Houston have been damaged by aircraft off the north coast of Java.On the 8th an American submarine reported that she had sunk one transport in convoy south of Macassar.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. In addition to the U-Boat sunk by H.M. Submarine Thorn, a number of attacks have been carried out by surface craft and aircraft off the Libyan coast,resulting in probable damage to three U-Boats. Other attacks have been madeby our aircraft and surface craft in the Western Approaches and north-east ofthe Azores without definite results.The s.s. Spondilus claimed to have damaged a U-Boat south of Colombo.American surface craft have carried out attacks off Newfoundland, in theFlorida Strait and south-east of Cocos Island.
Enemy Intelligence.Italian.7. During the past six weeks supplies have been reaching Libya fairlysteadily and without appreciable casualties. The port of Benghazi is not yet in use for supplying the enemy, and the ships reported by aircraft reconnaissancein that harbour are probably old wrecks.U-Boats.8. Slightly fewer U-Boats have been operating in the North Atlantic duringthe period, a large number of which are concentrated off the American seaboardfrom Cape Race to Charleston.- Others have been reported north-east of Bermudaand in the North-Western Approaches. In the South Atlantic two or threeU-Boats are operating between the Cape Verde Islands and Freetown.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. During the week eight ships have been torpedoed by U-Boats, four offthe eastern seaboard of North America, two north-east of Bermuda and two inthe North-Western Approaches; of these, four ships are known to be sunk. one ship in a coastal convoy was sunk by aircraft off the Humber and two ships were damaged in the Bristol Channel.Shipping losses in January (details are given in Appendix I), so farreported, were seventy ships and five small craft totalling 340,055 tons. The causeand locality of these losses is summarised in the following two tables : Summarised according to cause (tonnage in 1,000 gross tons).Mag.	By Sub-marine.		By Mine.		By Surface Craft.

The total tonnage sunk in this area amounted[23461] b
to 31 ships of approximately 195,000 gross tons. There was a singular absence of attacks on convoys in the Atlantic during the month.Five of the ten ships sunk by mines were small craft. All the mine lossesoccurred in Home Waters.Aircraft activity in home waters was slight, the majority of losses occurringin the Far East.In addition, the loss of 46,123 tons of shipping (details are given inAppendix Ia) was reported in January, although occurring in previous months.Losses due to Marine risk were heavy. . &quot;Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending the 11th February 1,066 ships, including 271allied and 25 neutral, were convoyed, of which only one ship in a coastal convoy was lost by enemy action. One cruiser, 4 anti-aircraft ships, 72 destroyers(including 24 American destroyers) and 101 sloops, corvettes and minesweeperswere employed on escort duties. During the month of January 3,769 ships were convoyed, of which 6 were lost by enemy action. Since the beginning of thewar 499 ships have been lost out of 102,836 ships which have been convoyed.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending the 7th February, totalled 729,000 tons, compared with 570,000 tons during theprevious seven days, and an average of 757,000 during the past ten weeks. Of theweek&apos;s imports, 201,000 tons were mineral oils of various grades.British Minelaying.11. During the period mines have been laid by surface craft off the FrenchBiscay coast, off the French Channel coast, off the. north-west coast of Scotlandand in the Faroes-Iceland area.Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out on a large scale off the FrisianCoast.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.12. On two nights of the week mines may have been-laid by enemy aircraftoff Milford Haven and on one night in the Thames Estuary.Eight magnetic mines have been destroyed and the mine totals are : 1,784magnetic, 1,230 acoustic, and 1,068 contact.Enemy moored mines are suspected in the approaches to Singapore, and a dangerous area has been declared.Vichy Merchant Shipping.13. There is increasing evidence that enemy forces in Libya are being largelysupplied by means of Vichy French merchant ships. Supplies are shipped from france to Tunisia and then sent on by rail or sea. These sailings startedsurreptitiously last November and have increased considerably until they nowaverage nearly two a week.Five Vichy merchant ships with Italian motor lorries on board have recently arrived at Tunis from Marseilles.The tanker Port St. Louis carried over 1,000 tons of petrol to Algiers from france in January.Far East. *14. At the outbreak of hostilities with Japan there were stated to be in far eastern waters 31 Vichy ships totalling 137,500 tons, eleven of which were* passenger ships. One was taken over by the American authorities and anotheris known to have been sunk. The Japanese have apparently threatened to seizeall the Vichy ships unless the Vichy Government agree to their chartering some80,000 tons of shipping, of which 50,000 tons will be used in the Manchukuo-China-Indo-China traffic and 30,000 tons in the Japan-Indo-China traffic. the vichy Government is anxious to maintain a certain amount of shipping for itsown use and has made counter-proposals. .
Russo-German Campaign.Central Sector.15. Local Russian advances near Velizh and Bely have met with severeopposition, and the Russian detachments which had cut the Smolensk-Vyasmaroad some 20 miles west of the latter town have probably been driven back. TheGermans have also prevented further progress by the southern arm of the pincer,to the north-west of Yukhnov. ;Ukraine. ,  j16. Fierce local attacks and counter-attacks have continued along the frontfrom Orel to Byelgorod. In the Donets salient the Russians have extended theirgains slightly, and German counter-attacks against the salient have probablyhad only local successes. The Russian General Staff appears confident that thesecounter-attacks cannot stop Russian progress, although they may retard it. TheRussians believe that they have sufficient forces available to exploit their break-through.Crimea. ... .17. The Germans still hold the neck of the Kerch Peninsula, and smallRussian detachments landed west of Feodosia have been mopped up. FightingContinues at Sevastopol, but the situation remains unchanged.Conclusions.18. The picture this week is one of continuous Russian pressure on many parts of the front, but progress has been considerably slowed down as comparedwith the past few weeks. This is probably due in part to German resistanceand in part to the abnormal depth of the snow, which virtually prevents all move-men t off roads.Libya.19. Since the forward troops of the 8th Army occupied their present line,which runs southwards from Gazala, no major operations have taken place. Ourfighting patrols and our mobile columns have been most active against the enemy in the Tmimi area and about Mekili.20. The enemy is apparently trying to establish a series of strong pointsextending for some 17 miles southwards from the coastal road between Gazalaand Tmimi. His object appears to be to prevent observation of his movementswest of that line. No doubt General Rommel is concentrating upon there-disposition of his forces and the development of his lines of communication,which must by now be extended to their limit.Far East.Singapore.21. Preceded by intense bombardment Japanese landings took place overa front of 5,000 yards on the north-west coast of the Island during the night ofthe 8th/9th February. After heavy fighting our troops were forced to withdraw to the line Sungei Kranj i-Sungei Jurong. During the night 9th/10th Februaryfurther landings took place west of the Causeway, compelling a withdrawal tothe main road from Bukit Timah village to the Causeway.22. On the 10th February a counter-attack restored the position on the main road. A further counter-attack to restore line Sungei Kranj i-Sungei Jurongwas launched, and the first phase was successful, but during the night the enemyagain broke through on the Bukit Timah road and a further attack failed to restore the position.[23461] B 2
23. The situation is now stabilised along a general line Naval Base-NeeSoon-Peirce Reservoir-Race Course-Holland Road Junction-Pasir PanjangVillage.24. The enemy are using medium and light tanks in their night attacks and during the day are supported by strong artillery fire, bombing, machine-gunning and incendiary mortar bombs, and are employing their usual tactics ofinfiltration. ,,Burma.25. West of the Salween River there has only been slight activity during thepast week. Contact has been established between our forces and enemy patrolswhich have crossed the river about 10 miles north of Martaban. Reports datedthe 10th February give information of concentrations of barges north and west of Martaban in the Salween River.  Paan is in enemy hands!26. The Chinese forces in the north have been in contact with the Siamesewho crossed the frontier. In an engagement at Wanpakok thirty Siamese were killed and some ammunition destroyed.Pacific.27. Japanese attacks in the New Guinea area continue. It has been confirmed that Rabaul is in enemy hands, and there has been a Japanese landing at Gasmata (on the south coast of New Guinea).28. In Borneo enemy penetration in the north-west and east of the islandcontinues. The Japanese forces are within 50 miles of Bandjermasin, the capital of South-East Borneo. They are also reported to be within a short distance ofSamarinda, which was believed to be still in Dutch hands on the 10th February.The survivors of the Balikpapan garrison have reached Samarinda.29. In the Outer Islands the. enemy had completed the occupation ofAmboina by the 9th February, and attacked Macassar on the 10th February.150 men of the Netherlands East Indies garrison troops have escaped fromAmboina, and an unknown number of Netherlands East Indies troops are continuing guerilla fighting on the island.Philippines.30. There have been renewed and unsuccessful Japanese attempts toinfiltrate into the American position on the Bataan Peninsula.Intelligence.Far East.31. Recent identifications suggest that two divisions have been withdrawnfrom Manchukuo, and two divisions from North China, to reinforce the japanese forces in the southern theatre of operations. The general distribution of japanese forces at present is therefore estimated to be as follows : (a) Japan : 10 divisions.(b) Sakhalin, Manchukuo and Korea : 23 divisions.(c) North and Central China : 12 divisions.(d) South China Seas and Pacific area :  27 divisions, of which 4 are believed to be at sea in transports.Of these forces, it seems unlikely that in present circumstances any more divisions would be taken from Manchukuo or China for fresh operations. There^remain, however, two divisions in Indo-China, two believed to be in Formosawhich are immediately available, and a further recently mobilised 10 divisions in Japan which could be made available at short notice if required. It isestimated, therefore, that the Japanese have available four divisions in transportsfor operations believed to be imminent, a further four divisions immediately available in the South China Seas area, and ten divisions from Japan which could,be made available at short notice. .
General Review.32. Adverse weather conditions again restricted our operations against enemy targets on the Continent and shipping in Home Waters.Successful attacks were made on enemy motor transport in Libya. enemy attacks on Malta have continued.Singapore Island was heavily attacked by enemy aircraft.United Kingdom.33.   Fighter Command flew 1,728 sorties by day and 224 by night.34. Enemy operations were again on a very small scale. Whilst this was partly due to the policy of conserving the forces available, the weather was certainly too bad to permit more than small night operations from selected bases.Only 13 aircraft crossed the coast by day and 7 by night.Germany and Occupied Territory.Night.35. As the weather was again unfavourable, Bomber Command operated on three nights only. Two hundred and forty-six sorties were flown compared with146 in the previous week, and 274 tons of bombs were released.36. The docks at Brest were attacked on three nights by a total of 54 air-craft which dropped 98 tons of bombs. Results were not observed on two nightsbecause of thick clouds, but on the third some bursts were seen in the target area.37. More than 80 tons were dropped on the ports of Bremen, Emden andHavre. At Bremen, visibility was bad, hut at the other two ports it was good and fires were seen in the docks.38. Mannheim was bombed by 38 aircraft, which dropped 66 tons. Search-light dazzle made observation difficult, but bombs were seen to fall in the town.39. Boston aircraft of Fighter Command bombed the aerodromes atAbbeville and Dinard.Day.40. Operations by Bomber Command were confinedl to mine-laying off the frisian Islands by a total of 62 aircraft. Enemy aircraft were encountered, andone was shot down.   Three of our aircraft are missing.Fighter Command despatched 81 defensive sorties during the week.Coastal Operations.41. Coastal Command flew 213 patrols (349 sorties) and 47 additionalsorties on convoy escorts. Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Commandinvolved 1,202 sorties, which is nearly double the total for the previous week.42. A Hudson attacked a merchant vessel of about 3,500 tons off Lindesnesin South Norway. An explosion was seen amidships, leaving the vessel low inthe water and listing to port. Another Hudson made a hit amidships on a4,000-ton merchant vessel off Terschelling. Attacks were also made on other ships off the French, Dutch, and Norwegian coasts, but results were not seen.43. Aircraft of Fighter Command attacked with cannon and machine-gunfire an E-boat off Alderney and an escort vessel off Dunkirk.44. Many photographic reconnaissances were flown, including some of Brest,Cherbourg and Trondheim.45. Enemy activity consisted mostly of anti-shipping operations over theNorth Sea.
Mediterranean.Libya.46. Fighters continued their successful attacks on enemy M.T. and supplycolumns, and on the 4th February 62 vehicles were destroyed or badly damaged.On the following day two squadrons of Blenheims also participated in these attacks, and it is estimated that the operations, were the most successful of thewhole campaign, more than 100 vehicles being destroyed or damaged. Littleenemy ground movement was apparent on the next two days, and the effectiveness of our attacks was correspondingly reduced. , i.Owing to the small number of suitable targets available and the enemy&apos;s useof decoy M.T. convoys, heavily defended by A.A. guns, low-flying attacks by our fighters on enemy&apos;s lines of communications were discontinued. ,:47. Enemy fighter activity was considerably increased as a result of hisoccupation of aerodromes in the Derna-Martuba areas, and our fighter sweepshad several engagements with Me. 109s. An attack was made on Derna aerodromeby Blenheims with an escort of Kittyhawks, during which one direct hit andmany near misses were made on aircraft on the ground. The escort was engagedby enemy fighters on the outward and- return flights, as a result of which threeMe. 109s were shot down for the loss of four Kittyhawks.48. Two night raids were made on the town and harbour of Benghazi bya total of 35 Wellingtons, which dropped 40 tons of bombs. These attacks were used to cover minelaying operations by 12 other Wellingtons, which successfullydropped their mines in the approaches to the harbour.Tripoli (L) was attacked by two Liberators which dropped seven tons of bombs, all of which burst on the Spanish Quay. These aircraft operated froman aerodrome south of Port Said, and one of them completed the flight of2,300 miles without refuelling. An attack was also made by eight WellingtonsOn Martuba landing ground, where bombs were observed to fall among dispersedaircraft and started some large fires.49. Eight Wellingtons from Malta made a night raid on a motor transportpark south of Tripoli (L). Many fires were started which were increased by laterattacks, and a large explosion was observed at the electrical power station.Another raid was made on shipping in the harbour resulting in at least threedirect hits and a number of near misses. Seven Wellingtons also bombed the jettyat Sirte.50. A day attack by three Blenheims was made on two merchant vesselsdischarging into small craft at Buerat-el-Hsun. On their return all these aircraft were shot down by Me. 109s near Malta.51. The scale of enemy effort has not been high. At the beginning of theweek Eastern Cyrenaica was waterlogged, and this probably delayed the bringingup of supplies. Offensive operations were principally directed against our aerodromes at El Adem, G-ambut and Acroma, but no damage of importanceresulted. Two of our aircraft were destroyed on the ground and three others damaged, while two enemy aircraft were shot down and another probably destroyed. .52. Some dive-bombing attacks were made on our troops in the forwardareas, causing a few casualties; three enemy aircraft were shot down by A.A. fire and two others probably destroyed. An attack was also made on our advancedfighter refuelling ground at El Gazala, causing some casualties and damasreto M.T.JMalta.53. Attacks on Malta against the aerodromes and the Grand Harbour have continued throughout the week, and during the first three days were on a fairlyintensive scale. Considerable damage was caused to buildings. FighterOperations were hampered by the unserviceahility of our aerodromes owing toflooding and the effect of bombing attacks.On the 11th a total of 65 enemy aircraft made four attacks on an incomingNaval Force and on the aerodromes at Takali and Hal Far.   Hurricanes which
were airborne on covering patrol intercepted the enemy bombers and probably destroyed one and damaged two others. Details of damage sustained by thisNaval Force are reported in the Naval Section.Sea Communications.54. An enemy merchant vessel of 6,000 tons escorted by two destroyers was attacked by two Swordfish 65 miles E.S.E. of Sfax. One hit with a torpedoresulted in a violent explosion and a large fire. Another vessel of 600 tons wasalso hit and seen to stop.Greece and the Dodecanese.55. On the night 7th/8tih seven Wellingtons from Egypt attacked the dock-yard at Salamis. Bombs were seen to burst among munition buildings and along the quay at the base of the submarine wharves. One other Wellington bombedMenidi aerodrome and started two fires. On the following night an attack wasmade on the Piraeus resulting in an explosion and fire at a chemical works.56. Four Wellingtons made a night attack on the submarine base at Lerosand started a fire.   Two other Wellingtons bombed Heraklion aerodrome.Russia.57. There has been no marked change in the air situation on the russian front.The Far East.Burma.58. Our aircraft made several attacks during the week on concentrations of enemy troops, boats and barges. In the Paan area ammunition dumps and a building believed to be a Japanese headquarters were hit. Moulmein was also bombed and machine-gunned, hits being obtained on rolling-stock and sheds atthe railway yard and on shipping in the river.59. Mehongsong aerodrome (200 miles north of Moulmein) was raided by11 Lysanders. Hangars, buildings and the W/T station were set on fire, andsome aircraft on the ground were either destroyed or damaged. Six otherLysanders successfully bombed the barracks at Chiengrai (300 miles N.E. ofRangoon).Our aircraft also made several reconnaissances of coastal areas, and ofBangkok, Mesod, Raheng and Tak.60. The enemy made two raids on Rangoon, one of which was carried outby 30 fighters. Ten of these were destroyed, and ten others probably destroyed,without loss to ourselves.61. Four attacks were made on our aerodromes at Mingaladon andZayatkwin near Rangoon. Two aircraft were destroyed on the ground, but our fighters destroyed four enemy aircraft, probably destroyed two and damaged four.Singapore.62. Enemy pressure in the air was very heavy, and bombing and machine-gun attacks were frequent. In the early part of the week, before the assault on the Island, heavy attacks were made on aerodromes and on shipping. AtKallang, hangars, buildings, and an aircraft on the ground were destroyed.63. After the enemy had landed on the Island on the night 8th/9th, hisair attacks were mainly directed against our troops in the forward areas, A.A.positions and shipping. Several attacks were also made on the town. an indian Hospital was burnt out, and heavy casualties suffered by the patients.Two large petrol dumps were also destroyed.On the 10th, the few aircraft which had remained on the Island, were with-drawn to Sumatra.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.69. Bombs were dropped in daylight on the 5th February in the Orkneysand on the 6th in the East Riding and Norfolk.During the nights of the 5th/6th and lOth/Tlth bombs were dropped inNorthumberland and on the 7th/8th near Land&apos;s End.No serious damage has been reported as a result of any of these incidents.Casualties.70. During the week ending 0600, the 11th February, no fatal civilian casualties due to enemy action were reported and only 2 people were seriously injured.Netherlands East Indies.64. The aerodromes at Palembang in Sumatra were heavily bombed! at least six times by the enemy. Many of our aircraft on the ground were either destroyed or damaged.65. In Java, enemy aircraft caused slight damage to the docks at Sourabaya,considerable damage to an army camp at Malang, and destroyed seven aircraft in the air and on the ground at Batavia.66. An enemy ship, believed to be an aircraft carrier, was hit by bombersoff Sindjai in the Celebes.Pacific Zone.67. Enemy activity was directed mainly against the east coast of new guinea.   Salamoa was raided by a flying boat, but no damage was caused.68. Enemy shipping off Gasmata in New Britain was attacked by Hudsonsand two transports were hit.
