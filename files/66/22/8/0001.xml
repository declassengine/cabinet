13;th February,. 194-2ovTAR   CABINS&apos;    Effect of Income Tpjcjai the Weekly Wage-earner,Haaornndian by tho Minister of Labour and National Servicep .1C     In Deccmbor I informed my colleagues on the Lord President&apos;s Committee ofthe urgent need, in my view, for a thorough examination of the whole questionof the Income Tax collection especially from wage-earners, and I drew attentionto certain specific points wliich seemed likely to cause dissatisfaction andunrest if the method of applying the tax to the new classes was not modified,There is growing evidence of resentment against the alleged injustices inherent in the present system, and this is-bound to have a serious effect on production,YJithin the past for/ days a resolution has been passed by a mass meeting ofShop Stewards on the Clyde in favour of an embargd on all overtime as from 1st March: if &apos; adjustments . are not made to meet real grievances^     The view ofmany trade union officials is that the main cause of discouragement is the factthat the current tax. is-related to past earnings and that the main grievance  -would be-net if the tax was-paid on current .earnings? leaving for later&apos;settlement, minor adjustments between individuals *     I aa bound, therefore,, tostate,,.:with the utmost emphasis, my conviction that the present system as it *applies to the weekly wage earner must be modified and I ask that a Committeeshould be appointed to report&apos;urgently on improvements which could be made withthe view to their inclusion in the forthcoming budget,2.9     I regard it as of the utmost importance that a decision be taken on thismatter, and a suitableaunnouncement made? at the ea-rliest opportunity ^3*     It may be convenient if I indicate to my colleagues the aspects of thepresent system which give rise to a sense of injustice, and in-some casescause hardship and discouragement of full support for war productions.(a) Tax based on earnings for the period April to September is deductedin the subsequent period January to June,     Thus the rate of tax.&quot;.V&apos;   . is increased at the time when earnings in many vital trades.)&apos; particularly shipbuilding, building and docks, are. at their lowest*. ;On the other hand when earnings are at their peak in the summer-, the  .-rate of tax will be reduced^ -    &apos;. (b) Again owing to the delayed action in tax collection^ the. tax becomes. .- a debt to be paid by men who have ceased to earn wages at. taxable&apos;.: .&apos;..;,...     level, e,g., men who are required to join the- Services J . men. who-       .are injured in the course of their employment or become sick or are ccmpulsorily transferred to lower paid employments .  Unless the,tax can be deducted immediately in respect of the current earnings,,tho present, serious position Tall continue and &quot;will become&apos;more acutewhen earnings, fall as overtime and Sunday work are reduced and   -financial. embarrassment will be widespread,(c) Although there is a level below which wages cannot &quot;be reduced in&apos; any Week ( 1,17*6d.. for a single man and  2.17*63.*   for a married man),there is no limit on. the proportion of income which may be deductedin., any week.     Accordingly; a married man whose standard of living isadjusted to an income of  6 a week, may find that owing to arrears.of tax., his. wagp in a particular week may be reduced by more than half*Moreover a married man has to make formal application before he becomes&apos;   entitled to the higher level of  2,17*6d* .raff. / /COPY TO.W.P.(42)78
(d) It is. no doubt, logical that all overtime and payment for Sundaywork should be treated as additional income which is sub ject total* -   There is, however, a frig psychological difference between&apos;the tax on ordinary weekly remuneration and the &quot;tax on thepayment made for the extra effort in the:interests of production&apos; - &apos; whieh overtime and Sunday woxk represent.     Seme way must be found of recognising this difference between ordinary income and incomeduo to special efforts made because of the urgent noeds of war &apos; -production., -   -(e) Married women are being asked to. return to industry or to takewage, earning employment for the first time. The operation ofthe- income tax arrangements!-is a definite discouragement, as alarge proportion of the earnings is taken in income tax if the husband has already.exhausted the benefit of the personal allowances.Also it is made to appear that the wife pays more in taxation thanher husband in relation to her wages. -,- &apos;; ,4*     These are some of the questions which call for-urgent examination .andadjustment.     In all these cases the real essence of the matter, is that, the wage earner budgets on the basis of his&apos; weekly earnings * -. He judges &apos;.the operation: of the Income Tax system by-its immediate effect on his        &apos;weekly pay packet end he is not consoled by assurances that, taken over, aperiod of six or twelve months, the British system of taxation is the most&apos;equitable that can be devised.     It is possible to remove misunderstandingabout the operation of Income Tax and&apos;a-good-deal is-being done in this .direction.     But the, trouble goes much deeper than that raid the grievancesmust be removed if continuous support is -tolfre given to the war effort.// - &quot;any system must be simple in its operation and. must be related to currentearnings * :J. .-&apos;: .&apos; , .--.     - - .E.B.13t-h February? 1942sH.Q.4W-85 B.Lo
