WAR CABINET.WEEKLY WIRELESS.Note by the Secretary.THE attached Radio Weekly American Survey, dated the 12th February,1942, received from the American Division of the Ministry of Information, is circulated by direction of the Prime Minister.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES.Great George Street, S. W. 1,February 16, 1942.RADIO WEEKLY AMERICAN SURVEY.[Note. This report is based mainly on items and trends, differing from the weekly summary cable of press and radio.]1. Singapore.(a) General comment. -Commentary reached the depth of depression on the apparent loss of Singapore, but criticism is confined as yet to a minority, and much of this by implication only.(b) Other commentators. Tex McCrary, in a review at the end of the week from New York, warned that the loss of Singapore will be the signal for theIsolationists to launch attacks against the British for keeping too many troops athome. Gabriel Heatter called Singapore another Dunkirk, while Eric Seva Reidcompared it to Crete. Fulton Lewis puzzled over the possibility of the quickcollapse of Singapore&apos;s supposedly impenetrable defence. Boake Carter took theopportunity to emphasize the statement of Sokolsky that Singapore&apos;s fall wouldmean the end of respect for the British Empire throughout the Far East.Waverly Root criticised the British failure to prevent the reconstruction of thecauseway; this also drew criticism from Wythe Williams from New York, andFulton Lewis, while Lowell Ragatz from Washington attacked the British lackof foresight in Singapore.2. Criticism of British War Strategy.The most bitter attack came from Earl Godwin in a local Washingtonbroadcast, thus providing a sharp contrast to the tone of his network commentary.He recommended that the United States should take the initiative, believing that[23468]., Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1942.SECRET. Copy No.   3^W.P. (42) 85.February 16, 1942.
2everyone was looking to Washington rather than to London, &apos;&apos; the capital of thetired and battered British Empire.&quot; He saw the Empire breaking up, and recommended that the United States, which first broke away from the empire which still holds its people in an out-moded system of diplomacy and caste, should lead the world.3. Pacific War Zone.(a) WaveWs statement on reinforcements. This statement of WavelVs at ih&amp;beginning of the week failed to arouse much confidence. William Parker fromLos Angeles described the messages of Wavell and Forde on reinforcements asjust bluff for bolstering the morale, and added that the United States had lostface in the Pacific, by coming under the command of one who regarded the Pacifictheatre of war as of secondary importance.(b) American reaction. Upton Close felt that the American people werewaking up to the realization that the United States was the only country equipped to deal with the Japanese, and repeated his emphasis on the Pacific war as thechief concern of the United States. The belief that the Americans were becomingaroused to the new war spirit was expressed by Alan Scott from Chicago, andWilliam Shirer, Wythe Williams from New York, and Raymond Gram Swingpredicted that the loss of Singapore would affect the American people more deeplythan the Pearl Harbour disaster. - Kaltenborn and Pearson and A lien criticisedthe handling of American censorship, laying the blame here for any over-optimismof the American people. As the fall of Singapore grew more likely, there was a growing tendency to criticize American complacency. Parker from Los Angelescriticized his fellow-commentators for not realizing that the United States waslosing the war.4. Aid to Russia.The&apos; importance of sending supplies to E-ussia, enabling the offensive to becontinued, was well recognized during the middle of the week by John Hughes,William Shirer, Pearson and A lien and Edward Murrow, while the prospect ofRussia defeating Germany led Gram Swing to comment that this will give theRussians a majority in the peace conference, but it was not believed that thedifficulties would be insurmountable. With the increased threat to SingaporeIsland, however, the problem of aid to Russia was forgotten.
