PRIME MINISTER&apos;S PERSONAL TELEGRAM.Serial Noe To 561/2,Washington, No,  116For Forme:.1 Naval Person,Purely PersonalsI have given much thought to the problem of Indiaand I am grateful that you have kept me in touch with it.As you can well-realise, I have felt much diffidencein making any suggestions, and it is a subject which, ofcourse, all of you good people know far more about than   do.     I have tried to approach the problem from thepoint of view of history and with a hope that the injectionof a new thought to be used in India might be ofassistance to you.      That is why I go back to the inception of the Government of the United States,, &apos;   During -the revolution, from 1775 to 1783,  the British Coloniesset themselves up as thirteen States,  each one under adifferent form of government, although each one assumedindividual sovereignty,,      While the war lasted there was great confusion between these separate sovereignties,  andthe only two connecting links were the Continental Congress(a body of ill-defined powers and large inefficiencies) -and second the Continental Army which was rather badlymaintained by the thirteen states.      In 1783, at the end ofthe war, it was clear that the new responsibilities of thethirteen sovereignties could not be welded into a federal Union because the experiment was still in themaking and any effort to arrive at a final frameworkwould have come to naught.      Therefore, the thirteensovereignties joined in the Articles of Confederation,an obvious stopgap Government? to remain in effect onlyuntil such times as experience and trial and error could bring about a permanent union,.     The thirteen sovereignties,from 1783 to 1789, proved, through lack of a   federalpower, that they would soon fly apart into separatenations.      In 1787 a Constitutional;Convention was held with only 20-5 or 30 active participants, representing all of the stateso     They met, not as a parliament, but asa small group of sincere patriots, with the sole objective of establishing a federal government*     The discussion wasrecorded but the meetings were not held before anaudience.     The Present constitution of the United Statesresulted and soon received the assent of two thirds ofthe states.It is merely a thought of mine to suggest the setting up of what might be called a temporary governmentin India, headed by a small representative group,covering different castes, occupations, religions andgeographies - this group to be recognized as a temporarydominion government0      It would, of course, representexisting governments of the British Provinces and wouldalso represent the Council&apos;of Princes, but my principalthought is that it would be charged with setting up a body -to consider a more permanent    government for thewhole country - this consideration to be extended over aperiod of five or six years or at least until a year after the end of the war.,     I suppose that this centraltemporary govorn&amp;ug   group,, speaking for the now dominion,would have certain executive and administrative powers over public services, such as finances..,- railways,,telegraphs and other things which we call public services^

Perhaps the analogy of some such method to thetravails and problems of the United States from 1783to 1789 might give a new slant in India itself,  and itmight cause the people there to forget hard feelings,to become more loyal to the British Empire,  and to stress the danger of Japanese domination, together withthe advantage of peaceful evolution as against chaoticrevolution;,Such a move is strictly in lino with the worldchanges of the past half century and with the democraticprocesses of all who are fighting Nazism.      I hope that whatever you do the move will be made from London andthat there should be no criticism in India that it isbeing made grudgingly or by compulsion.     For the love ofHeaven don&apos;t bring me into this,, though I do want to beof help.      It is,  strictly speaking, none of my business,except insofar as it is a part and parcel of the successfulfight that you and I are making.ROOSEVELT.Received 10o25o,  11.3o42.
