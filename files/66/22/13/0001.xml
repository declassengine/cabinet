C.DOMINIONS OFFICE,15th February,  1942.

OFFICE OF THEHIGH COMMISSIONER FOR CANADA,CANADA HOUSE,LONDON,  S.W.1.14th February, 1942.Dear Sir Eric,In the temporary absence of the High Commissioner I amwriting to you on the question of whether the reports receivedfrom the Military Attache at Chungking regarding the atrocitiesat Hong Kong should be given publicity at the present time.As Mr. Hudd stated in his letter of February 13th,  the question has been referred to Ottawa in order to obtain the views of theCanadian Government, and a reply has now been received from theMinister of National Defence.Mr. Ralston points out that the reports so far receivedfrom Hong Kong have been extremely contradictory in character and that in his telegram of January 28th the Military Attache&quot;at Chungking reported on the basis of information consideredaccurate from officers who had escaped from Hong Kong, to theeffect that the troops were being &quot;reasonably well treated&quot;.Meanwhile, on February 6th the Canadian authorities intercepteda broadcast from Berlin picked up by the Smeaton Listening Postin New York from a correspondent named Lothar Lucas, giving very substantial particulars of interviews with Canadian prisoners ofwar which indicated that they were in good spirits and whichdonveyed no hint of disturbing conditions.      This report was not published, as it came through Transocean Agency, which is under-stood to be German-controlled.The Canadian Government consider that the question as towhether any publicity should be given to the latest and mostcircumstantial account of atrocities in Hong Kong, i.e., thatreceived by the Military Attache at Chungking from Lt.-Colonel Rhodes who escaped on the 9th January, seem to dependon a large measure in establishing the authenticity of this account.      If the United Kingdom Government are satisfied as toits authenticity the Canadian Government would be led to thereluctant conclusion that no good purpose would be served bywithholding this information.      There is the further considera-tion.that this type of information is extremely likely to bepicked up and circulated to the neutral press in exaggeratedform,  if any exaggeration in this ease is conceivable, bycorrespondents in the Far East.At the same time, Mr, Ralston considers that owing to the uncertainties of communication, particularly by long-distancetelephone in China, there should, if possible, be some furtherconfirmation of the account given by Colonel Rhodes to theMilitary Attache at Chungking, and that most careful efforts should be made to appraise the accuracy of the report itself.The Minister of National Defence also suggests that Colonel Rhodesshould be communicated with again to ascertain if he has anyknowledge as to whether any Canadian prisoners of war weresubjected to the atrocious treatment described in his report, as having been meted out to British prisoners.When

When these enquiries have been made, and in theabsence of any information from the International Red Cross orother sources,  the Canadian Government consider that the only course would be to make public the conditions in Hong Kong insuch form as the United Kingdom War Cabinet might think proper.If no information is received which would enable the canadian government to give information regarding &quot;Canadian&quot; as distinct from &quot;British&quot; troops, they v/ould wish to considerpublishing the War Office communique in Ottawa simultaneously with its publication in this country, with the addition of astatement to the effect that it has not been found possible toobtain information as to whether the general term &quot;British&quot;includes &quot;Canadian&quot;.Since the above views of the Canadian Government were received,  the London correspondent of the Ottawa &quot;EveningCitizen&quot; has cabled a despatch to Ottawa, which appeared inthat paper on the evening of Friday the 13th February,containing a rex^ort of Japanese atrocities in Hong Kong sub-stantially similar to the account furnished by Colonel Rhodes.I have spoken to Mr.  Cummings about this despatch and he tellsme that he obtained the information upon which it is basedfrom the office of&quot;The Times&quot;.      I have also been in touch withthe Ministry of Information who state that owing to an error of judgment on the part of one of their censors in not referringthe despatch to a higher quarter the cable was allowed to go through to Canada.      I understand that the Minis try ofInformation have now taken steps to prevent any further storiesof this character reaching Canada from this&apos; country.It is evident that this unfortunate publication make sit very difficult for Mr. Ralston to continue to withhold anycomment on these reports.     But it is understood that the wholequestion of policy as to publication is to come before the WarCabinet on Monday and that the United Kingdom government consider it desirable that no Government statement should bemade in Ottawa on this subject until a decision has beenreached by the War Cabinet,, and the Minister of NationalDefence has been informed by cable of the United Kingdom view on this point.Meanwhile,  it is understood that the views of theCanadian Government on this subject will receive considerationby the War Cabinet.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.) O.S.A.  RITCHIE.SIR ERIC MACHTIG,  K.C.M.G.,   O.B.E.,DOMINIONS OFFICE,S.W.I.
