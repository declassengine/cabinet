s  - I / ^P*\ )THTR DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT).SECRET.W.P.   (4 ,12th February 1942.ALWAR    CABINET.CARRYING OF GAS MASKS BY THE PUBLIC.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home Security.I attach a copy of a Report by the Home DefenceCommittee (H.D.  (42) 5).This Report was made at my request following the receipt of proposals from the C-in-C, home forces (reproduced as Annex I to the Report) that soldiers should no longer carry their gas masks whenat their stations save on duty and in certain definedcircumstances.Having regard to the rubber situation, as well asthe present disregard by the public of the injunctionalways to carry gas masks, I am of opinion that it willbe better to follow the policy advocated by the C-in-C,Home Forces, subject to my having the assurance that theGovernment is reasonably likely to be able to give, a warning before the use of gas by Germany on any large scale.     I believe that, when it becomes necessary togive the public such a warning, it will come with muchgreater force if the recommended relaxation has first been allowed.I therefore ask the approval of the Cabinet to myadopting the policy recommended in the Report subjectto my reserving judgment on the methods by which thepublic should be kept up to scratch on the regularinspection of respirators, until I can consult regional commissioners.     It would be understood that this policy/would only be put into operation in conjunction with a   /similar policy for the Fighting Services.H.M.HOp: OFFICE.12th February 1942.\

WAR   CABINET.HOME DEFENCE COMMITTEE.CARRYIUB   OF GAS MASKS *Report to the Minister of Home Security.1&quot;.    You have referred for our consideration the general question of the need, for the general wearing, of respirators inpresent circumstances.    On the basis of a note put in by the .Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces,  (Annex I) we considered at thesame time the allied question whether service personnel shouldbe relieved of the necessity to carry their respirators untilthe invasion warning &quot;Stand To&quot; is issued.    In particular you have asked us to advise you as to whether there is a likelihood oflarge-scale gas attacks before invasion and, if so, whetheradequate warning can be safely expected.2.    Experience of the.enemy&apos;s methods indicates that, havingselected an objective, he concentrates all his strength and efforts on it.    While invasion remains a possibility it is highlyimprobable that he would reduce the very considerable surprise valueof the gas weapon in invasion by using it in advance on an operation against this country of quite minor importance-   Thisview is supported by strategical considerations.    In the view ofthe Air Staff, the balance of advantage would be with the Alliesif the Axis powers did begin the use of gas.    They are of opinionthat the likelihood of gas attack on this country unaccompanied byinvasion is remote.    In accepting this conclusion we have borne inmind the effect on the enemy&apos;s intentions of the knowledge thatthe public were not carrying their masks.    We are satisfied thatthis would be outweighed by other and more important factors andwould not affect the enemy&apos;s calculations, provided our arrangements for maintaining anti-gas efficiency are adequate.3.   No alteration of the. equipment of aircraft is needed forthe use of gas bombs instead of high explosive bombs and the chance that an individual German air commander might decide toinclude a proportion of gas bombs in a bomb load contrary to thepolicy of his Government though possible is highly improbable.Clearly no warning of such an attack can be given, and althoughfor the reasons set out above we consider such attacks unlikely,we are of opinion that it would be a wise precaution to requireCivil Defence workers to carry *the.ir respirators when on duty.   Weunderstand that the possibility - of applying this rule to thepolice, particularly police on duty at night, is underconsideration by. the Ministry of Home Security in consultationwith the Home Office.4.   We understand that certain transport drivers (both road and rail) are at present required by their employers1 to carrytheir respirators with them if their duties take them&apos;from homeat night.    As a further safeguard against the isolated raid weconsider that this rule should be applied to members of the publicsleeping away from home.5.   Once invasion has been mountedy gas attacks may begin atany time with little or. no warning.   For this reason we are ofopinion that the instruction to carry masks should not be rigidlyrelated to the issue of &quot;Stand To&quot; and we would suggest insteadthat the governing factor should be &quot;when the risk   increasesagain&quot;.     This phrase might replace the words &quot;at .all times from
-2-&apos;Stand to&apos;&quot; in the last sentence of paragraph 3 of theMemorandum by the commander-in-Chief, Home Forces reproducedat Annex I to this Report.    The necessary link between Serviceand civilian action might be achieved by synchronising   theinstructions to the civil population to carry or dispense withtheir respirators with orders to Service personnel.    (Seeparagraph 8).6.    It is vital that the proposed relief to the civilpopulation should not impair in any way the efficiency of ouranti-gas preparations and we attach great, importance to measuresto ensure that respirators- are-periodically-tested and that thepublic are exercised in wearing and inspecting them.    We have considered a number of suggestions to achieve these objectsincluding &apos; - ......(a)    the nomination of the first day of each month as&quot;gas day1&apos;.&apos;- when everyone (Service, personnel aswell as civilians) would be required to carry,--inspect&quot;and test his respirator by actual use.(b)&apos;   the increased use^. on these days of tear gas&quot;-demonstrations and mobile- gas vans for testingrespirators. - :We- - regard both these suggestions as valuable and recommendthat they be very seriously examined.    We understand that for anumber of reasons it would be impracticable to enforce the rule that respirators;should be carried throughout a given day everymonth, but we feel that a relaxation should depend on prior approval-of adequate plans for.attaining the purpose&apos;we have in.mind, in this paragraph;   much might be done by suitable publicity in the :conditions created by the new policy. r-7.    We have considered the draft notice to the publicannexed&apos; to the&apos;Memorandum prepared by the Ministry of Home    / &apos;:.Security.    We agree generally with it, subject to- certain amendments which we have incorporated in the revise which we, append at Annex II.   We consider that it should not be issued-until the arrangements for testing respirators by actual usereferred to.in paragraph 6 are complete..    -:-8.   We were&apos;informed that the broad policy set out in theCommander-in-Chiefs Memorandum (as amended in paragraph 4&apos; above)is accepted by the Service Departments,   -it is important that the-three Services should takd-common action to order that/respiratorsshould be carried or dispensed with but they should be free atany time of emergency to take - immediate independent action.&apos;   We&apos;,understand that adequate machinery exists for consultation betweenthem. : We^agree with the instructions for Army personnel suggestedfey the Commander-in-Chief, and we recommend that they should beapplied mutatis mutandis-by-the other Service Departments. &apos;9*    Following is a summary of our conclusions:-:,/&apos;-&apos;.&apos;.(a). There is no reason to suppose that the enemy will use   \gas in attacks on this country until-invasion-occurs.^The knowledge that respirators are not being carried&apos;is very unlikely to affect the enemy&apos;s calculations.(b)    Advice to the public should be synchronised&apos; with orders to Service personnel.(c).   All. civil defence workers on duty should be required tocarry their respirators;    the application of this rule to the police should be examined..
(d) it is of vital importance that the proposed reliefshould not reduce the efficiency of our anti-gaspreparations and in.particular stringent measures should be taken to ensure that respirators aretested periodically.    The Ministry of Home Securityshould consider the practicability of securing thisby such methods as the use of tear gas demonstrationsand mobile gas vans.(e) The draft public notice as amended should be issued whenthe machinery for testing respirators by actual use is ready to operate.    It should include notification of the tests and measures to be adopted.(f) The rule in the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s memorandum thatrespirators should be carried from &quot;Stand to&quot; shouldbe amended to provide for the issue of an order atany time when the risk increases again.     Theinstructions suggested by the Commander-in-Chief forthe Army should be applied mutatis mutandis to - theother services.10.    We have forwarded a copy of this report to the Chiefsof Staff Committee for their information.(Signed) S.F.STEWART.GREAT GEORGE STREET,  S.W.1.2nd February. 1942.

ANNEX I.MEMORANDUM BY COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, HOME FORCES.CARRIAGE OF GAS RESPIRATORS.1.       Consideration has &quot;been given to the various ways inwhich the GERMANS might first employ gas against thiscountry, with a view to determining whether the presentrules regarding the carriage of respirators should not herelaxed under present conditions.2.       In order to obtain the maximum advantage from the initial use of gas, and to limit retaliation by us againsttowns in GERMANY,  it appears probable that the GERMANS will begin this form of warfare on, or immediately previous to,attempted invasion.Such action would be in accordance With the militaryprinciples adopted by the GERMANS in this war.      I cannot ofcourse say that this method is a certainty, but I considerit sufficiently likely to justify reviewing our policy for the carriage of gas masks, particularly in view of theshortage of rubber.3. I therefore recommend that in the interests of thewar effort as a whole we accept a small degree of riskunder present conditions,  and endeavour to save the wearand tear caused to respirators by constant carriage.       Itwould be necessary in that case, to enforce with the utmoststrictness the carriage of respirators by everybody at all times from &quot;STAND TO&quot;.4. It is suggested therefore, that,  as regards the Army,-instructions should be as follows :(a)   A soldier will Carry his respirator.(i)   At all times in F.S, marching order,(ii) At any other time ordered by hisCommanding Officer,(iii)    On guard and piquets.( iv)( iv)    After &quot;STAND TO(b)   A soldier when absent from his station willtake his respirator with him.   He need not carry it, except under the conditions ofpara. 4 (a) above,5. As regards the civil population,  it is noted that,in. the country as a whole, only a small proportion of thepopulation now obey the injunction to carry their gas maskswith them.    It is suggested that a more practical order, andone that would be more likely to be obeyed, would be thatgas masks -(a) should not normally be carried, but should accompany the individual if sleeping away from the normal placeof residence.&apos; (b) should be taken out and inspected on the first dayof every month.(c) after the issue of a warning through the B.B.C and thepress, should be carried by everybody at all times andm all circumstances.Ch^ooThw a5ove orders would of course be cancelled IfChemical Warfare started in any theatre of war.

ANNEX ii draft NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT GAS MASKS, &apos;- The war with Japan will affect the supply of rubberavailable in this country^   This fact will call for muchgreater care in the use of gas masks by the whole populationat home, so as to reduce the rate of damage and replacementand conserve supplies^iA main cause of damage is the shock and bumping thatis inevitable when gas masks are continually carried and theGovernment being of opinion that it will be possible to give some hours warning at least of the probability of large,scale gas attack,  it has therefore been decided that thebest course for the public to adopt in present circumstancesis not to carry their gas masks at all times, but to leave them at their place of residence where they can be reachedeasily in case of need.    ANYONE SLEEPING AWAY FROM HOMESHOULD CARRY HIS MASK WITH HIM,This does not mean that the risk of gas - attack isregarded as past.    On the contrary the Civil defence services are continuing with full preparations and trainingin anti-gas measures,  including decontamination and cleansingand the public likewise should keep in mind the instructions and advice previously given.It follows that when they are not being carried, gasmasks should always be kept in a particular place, easy toreach, but away from the risks of knocks and movement.They are the responsibility of the individuals who use themand whose life may depend on them.      Great care should betaken to ensure that they are in proper condition andthey should be examined every three or four weeks to seethat they are in good repair.     Any damage should at once be reported to the Civil Defence warden.IF RISK OF GAS ATTACK INCREASES, THE GOVERNMENT will issue A WARNING AND FROM THAT TIME MASKS MUST BE CARRIEDUNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.(Note:    Details of the measures for ensuring themaintenance of adequate anti-gas precautionswill be inserted when they have been:&quot; decided upon).&apos;
