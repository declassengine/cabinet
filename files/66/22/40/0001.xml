DECYPHER OF TELEGRAM

From Governor General to Secretary of State for India

Dated New Delhi 17.20 hours, 20th February, 1942.

Recd 17.15 hours, 26th February, 1942.

IMMEDIATE.

460 S.

Your telegram No. 3149 of 19th February, G.H.Q. India telegram No. 3062 G is dated 14th February and since then events have happened which have tended slightly to alter the situation, but comments I give below are not entirely based on changes which have occurred during the last 10 days.

2. Telegram tends to emphasise darker side of picture.

My detailed comment is as follows.

Paragraph 1. For various reasons, to which recent visit of Generalissimo largely contributes, antipathy towards Japanese has noticeably strengthened. Open expressions of sympathy are indeed almost entirely confined to forward Bloc elements but use of term "Hindu" in describing these elements is rather misleading. The Congress is rightly described as non-co-operative notwithstanding conditional co-operation tendered by certain leaders, but Moslem League as an organisation is not more co-operative, although Members are permitted to co-operate an individuals and many are doing so. Political readers are in fact still holding back, but there is not the least doubt that danger to India is now universally admitted. As regards communism and war, I would say little practical support is forthcoming from the party although there is lip service in plenty. A few young professing communists have applied for commissions in the army.

Paragraph 2. I would qualify the second sentence in saying that labour situation or the whole is not yet very disturbing.

Paragraph 3. Reference police. Shortage is apparent on verying degrees in certain Provinces, but elsewhere (? situation) is not unsatisfactory. Expansion of armed police is held up by lack of arms.

Paragraph 4. The spread of anti war and defeatist rumour is universal, although effect from military point of view is more marked in recruiting areas than elsewhere. Possibility of there being enemy agents at work has not been overlooked, but apart from certain instances linked with forward Bloc activities there is no clear indication at present of enemy agencies. Recruiting has indeed been adversly affected, but I would be inclined to say that bad news from the front and fear of the troubles outlined in 2nd sentence of paragraph No. 2 of telegram have been mostly responsible as deterrent. Funk is definitely a factor; protection of property and dependents is another.

3. Following (? are) my views on general situation. The fall of Singapore did not come as a surprise to the public and shock was somewhat softened in consequence; but immediate effect

on the -general public has been perceptibly to increase thealarm.      There is widespread apprehension that Japanese attackon land of India, by so a,  land and air cannot be long delayed..Reports from coastal towns indicate conservation and in oneor two areas preparations were intensified for a large halfwaydispersal to places of greater saff i &apos;&quot;y.      Industrial centreshave not so far been appreciably a:( feet ad. but a certain amountof labour unrest in Calcutta is eat sing anxiety-.      In severalparts of the country, fear of internal disturbances, possiblycommunal;,  is gaining a hold on the public mind,      (? Press) hasbitterly criticised neglect of  effaces of eastern outposts of empire,      Contributory causes of defeatism are the Axis broadcastsalarmist rumoursa circulated by im evacuees from Burma and far East, and Irresponsible utterances of political speakers..There are also indications of a preparedness on the part offindividual Indians to sit quiet anc bow (? to the) inevitableif it ensues,4-o      On the credit side,  there is growing evidence of an appreciable hardening of opinion against the Japanese which may-in the course of time become widespread enough to do somethingtowards restoring morale.      Some attribute&apos; this developed to visit of Chiang Eai Shek.  others tc an awakening to I plications&apos;to fall of Singapore.      Another satisfactory feature is.noticeablein good reception recorded in Press to commander in--Chief&apos;s frankviews in the Legislative Assembly ca the East and gravity ofwhat the future may hold in store.-      But historical readiness of masses to accept a new conqueror must not be underratedespecially when they know that he will fight with gloves off-.Some indication of feeling&apos; in the country is reflected in thewithdrawal from Savings Banks and discharge off cash certificates,These are on a far lower scale than in June and July 194-0 afterfail of France.,      The figures for l:.st week which possibly indicatesome increase are not yei: available, but the totals for periodDecember 7th 1941 to February 14th 1942 were Rs,   crores 3.84(Savings Bank) and 1,99 (cash certificates) respectively-Corresponding figures for period June 1st to July 51st wereRs,   crores 11-43 and 4,49,      One re .son for this&apos; marked contrastmay be the fact that weakness off holders have already withdrawntheir savings and only a core of deposits have been iefft.*     Theprice- off gold has tended to rise.,  indicating a sense offinsecurity and a tendency to hoarding!.

Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India; dated New Delhi, 14.40 hours, 28th February, 1942.

No.481-S.

Private and personal. Secret. Firoz Khan Noon has asked me to sent (sic? send) to you following private and personal telegram. If is worth attention as showing what the Viceroy will be up against. Text of telegram. Begins. Sparu Conference not non-party but all Hindu parties conference. Sapru and his colleagues although moved by patriotic sentiments have been serving as agents of Congress. Their aim is that if during the war India cannot become a Dominion, Government of India should pass into Indian hands under the existing Constitution, and thus establish Hindu Raj immediately. Moslems are at the moment extremely (? apprehensive) that H.M.G. are step by step yielding to agitation of a vociferous party and giving way contrary to pledges which they have always given to Moslems, Princes and other minorities. Immediate Indianisation of the whole Cabinet will remove European element, on whom minorities can now depend for assistance in cases where Hindu majority makes a combination against them. Even now Cabinet over-weighted against Moslems, three against five other Indians. If H.M.G. Indianise whole of Indian Cabinet them in the absence of safeguards which in any case have proved useless in the Provinces and in order to protect Moslems and other minorities, Moslems must have 50% stats in Indian Cabinet: else whole of non-Congress India, through sheer desperation, will create a serious situation adversely affecting the war effort. If, H.M.G., contemplate making an immediate declaration of creating India Dominion, Moslems demand for Pakistan must be conceded in the same statement. If you are about to declare that after the war India will be made dominion, then Moslems (?expect) that you will also declare that if Hindus fail to come to an agreement with Moslems Pakistan will also be granted. Otherwise Moslem India will be up in arms and you will have North West Frontier problem also. Congress believe they can force the hands of H.M.G., and that is why they have made not the slightest move to win agreement of Moslems.

Only reason by Congress have not been able to create disturbances in India is that Moslems are not with them. But once H.M.G., through hasty or ill-considered decision, are forced to push Moslems into open opposition, Congress (?may) decide to join hands with them and (?create) greater (?difficulties) than ever. Moslems here apprehensive that new elements in power in London may enforce a policy of reconciling the irreconcilables, forgetting that the cup of patience of other parties already full. No one can ignore the part that Indian Princes and Moslems are playing in the war effort, nor can it be forgotten that in spite of Congress opposition sixty-five per cent of new recruits are non-Moslems. If H.M.G. makes peace with the Congress agitators, (?they) do so at very heavy cost. Congress already feel that they made mistake by going out of office in the Provinces; and so far as my information goes, they do not wish frankly to come forward and give an undertaking that they will help in war effort is restored to office, but they wish to use Sapru and others in securing

HinduMahaoabha plus NepaloSo       Before declaration of August I94-P Afghan Governmentevinced nervousness on the issue of Dominion status^ -Ministerof/

of war reminded that treaties are with British Government not India and that grant of independence to India, spelling failure to guarantee Moslem minority, would lead to change in Afghan policy. Afghab Minister for Foreign Affairs said that question of direct access to the sea would become prominent if control of ports passed to India&apos;s hands. Axis propaganda plays on same theme. Irredentism will be strengthened by promise of fight to secede and position unlikely to be saved by right of provincial option owing to cross currents in North West India set up by the latter proposal. Tribes would see prospect of removal of all steadying factors e.g. allowances, and regard announcement as invitation to cash in before dissolution. Morale of irregulars on whose steadiness frontier peace depends would suffer. The only steadying factor now present is alliance with Russia which would incline Afghan rulers to held back in (? fear) of threat to northern provinces. Nevertheless success of last two and a half years in keeping frontier steady could scarcely continue, and it would be necessary to look to the rear while engaged to the east. Any success by Germany in Middle East would have added dangers.

Nepal.

4. At the time of the 1940 Declaration His Majesty&apos;s Government were made aware of Nepalese anxiety as to (a) safety of Nepal&apos;s frontiers with India: (b) maintenance of present position of Gurkhas in Indian Army. Behind (a) lies Nepalese ambition for territorial gains in India. Any doubt (? in case of) (b) will affect nearly l00,000 good troops. Maharaja is likely to see in Declaration shadow of defeat and his loyalty, great as it is, may not be proof against advice to withdraw his subjects from our armies before it is too late. He has advisers who will suggest to him the opportunity for extending his frontiers. In any case it would probably be necessary in order to save Gurkhas to accompany (? Declaration) with announcement that these troops will in future become Imperial Force outside Indian Amy. Even so Declaration must (? shake) Nepal&apos;s confidence in our cause and give rise to acute speculation regarding future of that state.

5. In both Afghanistan and Nepal Declaration will prove powerful aid to believe Axis theme of (? dissolution) of India end stimulus toward territorial gain at India&apos;s (? expense).
