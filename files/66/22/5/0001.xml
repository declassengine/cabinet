Great George Street, S. vV. 1.11th February, 1942.aGP-ICULTIT/jJb- PRICES.^PRIfrtE MINISTER.The war Cabinet decided, on the 4th February/thatthe total price increases necessary to fulfil theGovernment&apos;s pledge should not exceed  20M.      But theynoted that this decision took no account of theallocation of. the total sum between the variouscommodities - a question which might involve issues of high policy.2. The Lord President-1 :s Committee nad suggested/thatI.should assist in the allocation of the total sum, ifthe Departmental Ministers concerned had difficulty in reaching agreement among themselves.I have had several discussions with the agricultural ministers and the Minister of Pood;    and I now submit (Annexschedule of price increases which, in my view, represents the best distribution which can be made if regard is paidboth to the interests of agricultural policy and to the priorities in food production to which-the Minister of.Food attaches importance.3. I append short notes on certain items in this schedule:-Milk.  The Minister of Food is seriously disturbedabout the possibility of a drop in milk production - whichis, of course, of the highest value as a protective food.During the last twelve months the number of cows in milkhas decreased by 5 per cent., and milk sales have alsofallen off by the same amount.     .Milk producers also have .special difficulties over labour and feedingstuffs.      Forthese reasons the Minister of Food wished to give aspecial incentive to milk, and desired a price increase of2d. per gallon, at a total cost of  9.995M.On a review.of the whole field of agricultural prices, I felt that I could not justify an increase of 2d.per gallon for milk in relation to the other price increases which can be given within a total of  20M.      Ido, however, attach great importance to the arguments advanced by the ter of Food,, and I think that on these grounds an increase of lfd. per gallon can be justified.The Agricultural Ministers would have preferred anincrease of li-d. ;    and would have liked to see thebalance ( 1.249M.) distributed between eggs and pigs.-1-f/ W*M.(42) 15th Conclusions, Minute 3./ L.P.&apos;(42) 8th Meeting, Minute 1,Conclusion (7).

234u Pi,c;s.   The agricultural Ministers suggested anincrease of 1/- per score for&apos;pigs, involving a t-otal costOf      l&apos; SivioI do not recommend such an increase.      This pricehas already been advanced by 3/6do  per score since prices were fixed in 1940.     - further, it seems to me that any difficulty i.:. maintaining the -pig population is likely to arise from the Bhortag-- of feedings tuff s rather than the lack of a price incentive.5* Eggs.,  I have recommended that there should be no increase in.the price of eggs as part of this settlement.I ought, however, to point out that the Minister of Foodthinks it will be necessary for him to provide some furtherinducement to ensure that a sufficient number of eggs aresent to packing stations.      He believes, that it may benecessary to provide something like  -665M.  to ensure the efficient working of the egg-rationing scheme;    and this money will form an addition to the receipts of farmers.      it represents an increase of lOd. per 120 on the price of eggsdelivered to packing stations.The Secretary of State for Scotland would have liked to be able to announce this concession when the schedule of price increases is discussed&apos; with the farmers&apos; representatives.&apos;He feels that it will be difficult to justify a schedule of price Increases which gives nothing to -the poultry farmers.6&quot; SheejD. I recommend an increase of 1-gd. per lb. for fatsheep and lambs, representing a total cost of  1*905M.      Inmy view an increase of Id. wouxd be in scale with the otherincreases recommended in this schedule.      The agricultural ministers are, however, disturbed by the marked drop in the sheep population,;which has fallen (over the United .kingdom as a whole) by 5 million in the last two years:    and theythink it specially important that steps should be taken to check this tendency.      The price increase of l^d. which I have recommended includes an element of special incentive to      % .sheep farmers to maintain their flocks.7. Apart from the doubts which the Agricultural ministers have, expressed about eggs and, to a lesser extent, pigs(see paragraphs 4 and 5 above), the attached schedule of price increases may be regarded as acceptable, as a whole,to the Ministers concerned.u 1 e^ned)    JOHN ANDERS ON.11TH FEBRUARY, 1942.
