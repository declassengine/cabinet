COPY WO.23RD FEBRUARY,  1942.WAR CABINET.AIR REINFORCEMENTS FOR INDIA AND BURMA.Report &quot;by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.Now that immediate measures are in train for raising the4 Fighter Squadrons in Burma to full strength and effectiveness,the Chiefs of Staff have &quot;been considering ways and means ofincreasing the number of Fighter Squadrons in Burma and India.2. In order to meet immediate needs in the Far East wehave gone to the limit in taking away Fighter Squadrons fromthe Middle East;    in fact,  far from making further inroads intoMiddle East Fighter strength, we must now try to build it up,^n.3. The only way,  therefore,  to strengthen our Fighterposition in India and Burma is to send&apos;Squadrons from home andfor this purpose priority has been allotted to the R.A.F.  in convoy W.S. 17 sailing next month (March).4. We propose to send the 3 Hurricane Fighter Squadrons atpresent earmarked for operation GYMNAST.      These are the onlySquadrons which are ready for immediate despatch abroad.Moreover they already have Hurricane.equipment, which is the type ultimately required for India.      They will travel toIndia complete with aircraft.      This addition would bring the fighter strenght to the total number of Squadrons which can bemaintained in India and Burma with the aircraft which arelikely to be available during the two or three months subsequent to their arrival.5. The three GYMNAST Fighter Squadrons are, however, atpresent equipped with untropicaiised part worn aircraft.     Wecannot send these abroad and must, therefore, rob flhetropicalised aircraft about to be shipped to the Middle East.If this is done, the only way to avoid a serious hiatus in thesupply of Hurricanes to Egypt, India and Burma in the immediatefuture would be to borrow temporarily 72 Hurricanes from thoseallotted to Russia (March shipment) to be repaid during thethree subsequent months.6. The Chiefs of Staff, therefore, seek authority to borrow.72 Hurricane II aircraft from those now allotted toRussia and to repay thorn during the next three months.(Signed)    DUDLEY POUND.C.
