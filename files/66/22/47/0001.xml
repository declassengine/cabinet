Admiral Muselier, National Commissioner for the Navy, has resigned from the national committee. This resignation has been accepted, and the National Committee has appointed Admiral Auboyneau as National Commissioner for the Navy. Admiral Muselier, being without employment, has in consequence received a serviceappointment.&apos; His Majesty&apos;s ^xovernment have seen fit to intervene in this matter. you were good enough to let me know that His Majesty&apos;s Government, while having no wish to interfere with the composition of the French National Committee,would wish to see Admiral Muselier continuing to occupy the position of commander-in-Chief of the Free French Naval Forces, and yon added that you would shortly indicate to me the steps which the British Government had decidedto take in the event of the National Committee not accepting this condition.Before matters reach such a stage, I feel that I should set out the reasons why such an acceptance is impossible for us.It is, I think, necessary to emphasise our wish to be and to remain the loyaland resolute Allies of Great Britain. We have given, and continue to give, the clearest and indeed the most difficult proofs of this that men can give.But the work we have undertaken in the service of France is organisedoutside the usual channels (Chief of State, Government. Parliament, Civil Service,possibilities of legislation). The National Committee itself and a part of. itsforces and services are obliged to function on foreign soil. We naturally regretthis and hope that these abnormal conditions can be changed one day. But wehave to take things as they are. In consequence the whole structure is basedessentially on three exceptional elements.The first is I must apologise for having to write this the personal andsymbolic role played by General de Gaulle in the war, and the authority of theFrench National Committee which he has created.The second is the free and generous rallying of Free Frenchmen, and theardent sympathy of a very large number of those &quot;who are not free.The third is the maintenance of what remains of the independence andsovereignty of France for which General de Gaulle and the National Committeeare responsible to their country.It is these three elements which have allowed Free Frenchmen to bring back into the war important French territories and by no means negligible french forces, and to arouse in their country a hope and indeed a pride which keeps incheck treason and collaboration with the enemy.11662   [23552]SECRET.W.P. (42) 117.March 9, 1942.
The conditions&quot;.put forward by. the &quot;British- Government as regards the postto be assigned by the National Committee to a French general officer would, ifinsisted on, constitute a direct threat to all three of these elements. The national committee would refuse to agree to it.On the other hand, it is clear that in practice the organisation andfunctioning of Free France cannot, for material and political reasons, develop oreven continue as at present without the support of -the British Government.Moreover, it is on the basis of fidelity at all costs to the alliance with Great britain for the common victory that General de Gaulle has built up his whole movement.The Free French consider that what they have done side by side with the Britishand for the same cause implies that they should be regarded and treated asAllies, and that British support should not be continually modified and restrictedor given on conditions incompatible with their raison d&apos;etre.In particular, General de Gaulle, who both de facto and de jure is responsible for Free France vis-a-vis his own country and foreign Powers, couldnot maintain his movement if the moral, and material support of the BritishGovernment were to be questioned either as a whole or in any one respect; anda fortiori if that Government were to adopt towards the Free French an attitude which was inconsistent with measures taken by General de Gaulle himself andby the National Committee.If, nevertheless, such a situation should arise General&apos; de Gaulle and theNational Committee could no longer devote themselves to a task which would thenbe impossible. They consider it, indeed, absolutely essential, for the future ofFrance no less than for the present, to remain faithful to the aim which they have set out to accomplish. This aim is to restore France and reconstitute national unity in the war at the side of the Allies, but without sacrificing anything of theindependence and sovereignty of France or any of France&apos;s institutions.Yours very sincerely,C. de GAULLE.Foreign Office, March 9, 1942.SOdi I.
