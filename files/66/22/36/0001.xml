From   o.B     Secretary of Stats for IndiaTo      ooo     ViceroyDated 28th February 1942,(OhOPrivate and personal.   Please treat as Superintendenttelegram.1o     Prime Minister has set up India Committee of Cabinetunder Attlee5s chairmanship with myself, Anderson, Simon,Cripps and C-rigg.   We have decided in view of yourcriticisms to abandon the idea of setting up now an advis-cry body whicn is also to be the future constitution-framing body and favour a clear declaration as to thefuture both as regards procedure for arriving at the newconstitution and as regards India&apos;1 s future status, couplingwith if an invitation to Indian leaders to come in and helpnow but retaining our present responsibility for India&apos;defence,2,     The main now features of the declaration in itspresent draft form are (a) explicit acknowledgment that future Indian Dominion can secede if it so wishes; (b)that we definitely mean to set up what we consider themost suitable future constitution-making body immediatelyafter the war if Indians have not previously come to agreement on the subject themselves; (c) that any Provincethat does not wish to accede to the new constitution canstand out (this is to meet the Moslem League but it willhaveto be made clear that by so doing it does notsacrifice its prospect of attaining Dominion status);.(d) that the whole field of our obligations, as well as ofsuch continued military assistance as India may need, isto be dealt with by a separate treaty to be concluded with the constitution-framing body and to come into forcesimultaneously with the new constitution.

3.     The declaration ends with an invitation to Indian -leaders to participate in the counsels of their nation andgt e their active help.   This,, as at present drafted, leavesthe field open for negotiation.   The alternatives most likely to be acceptable if the general declaration findsacceptance, as well as most workable, would seem to becither (a) inclusion in your Executive of party leaders onthe lines suggested in paragraphs 6 and 7 of my 232 ofFebruary 22nd; (b) some modification of Schuster&apos;suggestion of a non-departmental VJar Cabinet in the natureof a small Defence or War Policy Committee of leading non-officials without portfolios but in regular session withyourself and the Commander-in-Chief or as occasionrequired with your Executive.4,&apos;       My immediately succeeding telegram contains our first draft of the proposed declaration.   I shall follow-it with a telegram with further comments and with variousamendments I would wish to propose myself.   As War cabinet will probably be discussing the whole subject on Mondayevening I am most anxious to have your own comments and suggestions as quickly as possible.   I fully realise whatall this means on top of your urgent preoccupations withthe war effort, but with a situation which must for sometime ahead get worse instead of better we cannot afford to delay our announcement of policy much further.

Following is text of Declaration referred to inmy immediately preceding telegram:-Begins   &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government, having considered the anxieties expressed in this country and in India as to the fulfilment of the promises made in regard to the future ofIndia, have decided to lay down in prseise and clear terms the steps which they propose shall be.taken for the earliespossible realisation of self-government in India,    The .object is the creation of a new Indian Union which shallconstitute a Dominion, equal in every respect to the UnitedKingdom and the other Dominions of the Grown, and free toremain in or to separate itself from the equal partnershipof the British Commonwealth of Nations.His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore make the followingdeclaration:-(a) Immediately upon the cessation of hostilities, thereshall be set up in India in the manner described hereafteran elected body with the power to formulate a newConstitution for India,(b) His Majesty&apos;5 s Government undertake to accept andimplement forthwith the Constitution so f ran eel subject onlyto:-(i) The right of any Province of British India that isnot prepared to accept the new constitution toretain its present constitutional position,provision being made for subsequent accession or foother arrangements for their separate politicalstatus, in the case of non-acceding Provinces,(ii) the signing of a treaty which shall be negotiatedbetween His Majesty&apos;s Government end the constituteion-making body covering all necessary matters relating go the complete transfer of responsibilityfrom British to Indian hands.

(ill) Xne adjustment of treaty arrangements with theIndian States so far as they do not exercise theirchoice to adhere to the new Union.(c^ The constitution-making body shall be composed asfollows, unless the leaders of Indian opinion in theprincipal communities&apos;agree upon some other form before theend of hostilities:-Immediately upon the result bring known of theProvincial Elections which will be necessary at theend of hostilities the entire membership of the LowerHouses of the Provincial Legislatures shall, as asingle electoral college, proceed to the election ofthe constitution-making body by the system of proportional representation0   This new body shall bein number about one-tenth of the number of the1electoral college,Indian States shall be invited to send representatives;in the same proportion of the total population as theaverage for British India,(d)   While daring the critical period   which now faces Indiaand until the new constitution can be framed, Kis majesty&apos;s government must inevitably bear the full responsibility forIndia&apos;s defence, they desire and invite the immediate and effective participation of the leaders of the principalsections of the Indian people in the counsels of theirnation to give their active and vital help in the discharge&apos;^of that task,&quot;   Ends,

From ..  Secretary of State for &quot;IndiaTo      . . Viceroy-Despatched  ..  1st March,   1942.XXX&apos;  MjMIMOST  IMMEDIATE3832. Please treat as Superintendent telegram.Following are alterations  oo draft declaration whichI propose to press fort(1)      In first paragraph omit the words from &quot;as to the fulfilment&quot; down to &quot;clear terms&quot; and substitute  &quot;as to thefuture  of India, have decided to define.&quot;Reasons.      To avoid the implication that hitherto wehave deliberately avoided being either clear or precise.asto their intention or as to the means of its. fulfilment.(2)      Towards end of first paragraph    delete after&quot;Dominion&quot; and substitute  &quot;associated with the UnitedKingdom by a common allegiance to the  Crown,  but equal toit in status,  in no way subordinate in any aspect of itsdomestic or external affairs and free to remain within orto separate from the partnership of the British Commonwealtof Nations.&quot;Reasons.        It sufficiently meets demand for &quot;independento state that India can secede and is desirable to mitigateshock to other elements here and in India by reaffirmingfact that an essential attribute of a  &quot;Dominion&quot; is itsallegiance  to the Crown.(3)  For the last eight words of sub-paragraph (a)   substitute&quot;object of formulating a constitution acceptable to thewhole  of India&quot;.Reasons.    This is more consistent with the hope of creating a new Union comprising all units on the onehand and on the other recognition of probability thatsome will refuse to come in,(4)      In paragraph (b)  for &quot;forthwith&quot; substitute  &quot;without-

avoidable delay&quot;.Reason.    Provisos (ii)  and (iii)  recuire time to be fulfilled before the  constitution can be implemented.(5)&apos;     In paragraph, (b)  sub-paragraph (i) after&apos;word &quot;retain&quot;insert  &quot;for the time being&quot; and for the words following&quot;separate&quot; to end of sub-paragraph substitute  &quot;constitutionaadvance on the  lines of this declaration&quot;.Reason.        No Province  at any rate which stands out willbe  content with mere provincial autonomy for long and if itintends to stand out permanently will require that it shouldbe able to accuire powers amounting to Dominion status.Compare pledge given to Burma in 1031 in event  of separation.(6)      Last few words of paragraph (b),  sub--paragraph (ii)should read;     &quot;responsibility in respect of the union fromthe British to Indian hands&quot;.Reason.      The body that frames constitution of projectedUnion will not be competent to negotiate in respect of matters outside the scope of the Union.(7)      Paragraph (b)   (iii)  should read &quot;The negotiation ofrevised treaty arrangements so far as these are required bythe new situation.&quot;Reasons;      The word &quot;adjustment&quot; is calculated to alarmRulers as implying unilateral over-riding of treaty rights.As drafted the proviso recognises only the need to adjustmatters of common administrative concern to one or otneradhering State and the Union (e.g.  transport questions.,postal rights,  etc.).      What the States -&quot;particularly, those that do not adhere - are likely to regard as far moreimportant is the question of the maintenanee of the treaties establishing their dynastic relations with the-Crown.(8)      Paragraph (c),  last paragraph.      After &quot;invited-to&quot;delete  &quot;send representatives&quot; and substitute   &quot;appoint

representatives with the same powers as British Indianmembers of the constitution-making body.&quot;B &quot;* sons;      The constitution-making body is described in(a)  as elected.      It is important to leave Rulers the rightto appoint their representatives,   and to make it ruito  clearthat the States&apos;  representatives should be  on an absolutelyecual footing with those from British India.(9)    For words from &quot;can be framed&quot; down to &quot;defence&quot;substitute   &quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot divest themselves of their responsibility for the  defence and good governmentof India.&quot;Reasons:      &quot;Defence&quot; in the restricted sense is not enoughto secure the position,   and duty of ensuring good governmentis clearly ours in the Provinces now administered underSection 93:    while even in those under Ministerial Governmentsduty is at least shared by His Majesty&apos;s Government as theresult of the  &quot;emergency section&quot; 126(A).(10)    Seventeenth word from tiie end &quot;Councils&quot; should ofcourse be  &quot;counsels.. &quot;

INWARD TELEGRAMFrom    .....      Governor-general to        .....      Secretary of State  lor India,Dated.....     2nd March 1942.497 -SYour telegrams 259 dated February 28th, 260 dated february 28th and 3852 dated-March 1st have reached, mebefore I could send off a considered reply to your tele- &quot;grams 232 dated February 21st and 239 dated February 24th.I of course had these telegrams in mind in framing mysketch declaration but considered myself at that time as  .under an obligation to produce in response to PrimeMinister proposals as far reaching as possibleincluding promises for future, made with a preambledesigned to inspire trust and, linked with tangibleimmediate advances,2.        The form of new draft has the great advantage,while limiting itself to a definition of steps to be taken,,of leaving intact the 1940 assurances without necessity ofrepeating them in same or different terms.3.        Its line also is one which I prefer as containingclear promises for future without specifically committingus during war to replace an Executive Council of selectedand representative individuals by one of a purelypolitical complexion.4.        I must however enter a caveat: if declaration Inform now proposed didresuit in securing active co-operationof Congress and League I very much doubt whether they wouldbe content with a seat here and there on my ExecutiveCouncil.   I should expect them to demand entry in strength^followed by a &quot;demand for disappearance.of official members and at any rate     th.  absence , at all events of c witrol fromWhitehall.   In that event the situation envisaged in

points 5, 6 and 7 of my sketch might develop che^factp,9hut with this advantage, that our hand would not havebeen shown in advance. 15.        We must also reckon on possibility that consequent upon 3desire and invitation&quot; referred to in last sentence of your draft I should be bound to uphold (sic) in fact to renew attempt at bringing major political parties together.    In that case the same train of events wouldprobably be set in motion.6.        We must therefore realise the possible consequencesand know our own minds in the event of such a situationdeveloping and I ought to know whether points 5 to 7 arein general terms an acceptable presentation of hand tobe played,7.        Time prevents my discussing in this telegram the suggestions contained in paragraph 3 of your telegram 259dated February 28th.    In general I doubt our ability to limit developments to this scope.    In particular I do not like the idea of a non-departmental war cabinet but willpursue these and similar matters separately.8.        I recognise that local option is an essentialcounterpart of promise to implement recommendations ofwhat is virtually a constituent assembly - a promise&apos; whichexonerates&quot;us from charge of delaying tactics.    I had fought shy of advertising local option now (though it was communicated, (corrupt group) in point 9 of my sketch)because it would produce (a) an immediate howl from Bengaland Punjab - Hindus and from Sikhs and (b) probably a delay adaction howl from Bengal Moslems who on second thoughtsmight fear that it would be far too easy for Hindus to buy enough Moslem 3VLL.As. to get a majority for adherence.

I am prepared, to take this risk for sake of precise-brief declaration which does not tie our hands in advanceregarding the immediate future of Executive Council - butwe are bound to be asked by - Jinnah how willingness of a province to accede will be determined - s.g. by whom and by what majority.    I can see no way of anticipating thisquestion in declaration or indeed of answering itsatisfactorily at present.   The stipulation for example ofa majority exceeding 50 per cent, in a ProvincialLegislature5 while arousing Hindu resentment, would notallay Jinnah&apos;s fears since the constituent body (which on proposed basis is bound to include a substantial majorityof anti-Moslems) could not be prevented from alteringProvincial boundaries and so nullifying any such stipulation.Once we venture on questions of this nature we get intodeep waters which we had better avoid,9,        As regards the States (a) the declaration should makeit clear beyond doubt that States will have a free choice to adhere or not to adhere.   The alternative for (b) (ill)suggested in paragraph 7 of your telegram 3832 does not adequately meet this requirement,    I suggest the following:-&quot;The negotiation of revised treaty arrangements with indian states so far as these are required by new situation; it being clear that any State may withhold its adherence toUnion,&quot;(b) The States may take exception to number of theirrepresentatives being based on population which would give them roughly one quarter of total representation, whereassection 18(2) of 1935 Act contemplated a maximum of 125States members in the Federal Assembly against 250 fromBritish India,   This argument however would be fallacious.Under 1955 Act they could get one-third of seats afterjoining in Federation: that is no reason for giving them

one-third in constituent body together with complete freedom to join or not to join in resultant constitution,Moreover the States are largely Hindu, they might weightthe balance against the Moslems in constituent body andthen back out in large numbers and undertake alternatelyto face the consequences.(c&quot;) Your suggested wording &quot;appointed representatives&quot;is certainly preferable: the declaration should notadumbrate method of appointment.10,        The following relates to wording of declaration.(a) Paragraph 1 of your telegram 3852, 43s-IT, 0^***&quot;(b) Paragraph 2 of your telegram.   Having gone so far whyboggle at word &quot;independence11 with all its appeal toIndia?   I suggest that end of first sentence should read&quot;realisation of self-government and independence forInd ia.&quot;(c) Paragraph 3 of your telegram,   -In sub-paragraph (a) of delclaration I would, omit the word &quot;elected&quot;.   It pre-judges the method of selecting States representatives, anawould give grave offence to Rulers.(d) Paragraph 4 of your telegram. I far prefer &quot;forth-with&quot; to the expression &quot;without avoidable delay&quot;&apos; whichwould be attacked as hedging.(e) Paragraph 5 of your, telegram: for the words &quot;toretain for the time being its. - \f: undeniable) position&quot;,which are not strictly accurate I would substitute the plain expression &quot;to remain outside the Union&quot;..   I presumethat &quot;and&quot; has been omitted above the words &apos;&quot;accession&quot;and &quot;to&quot;1.   1 suggest that the last words should read asfollows:- &quot;separate political status and. (?. position ) inthe case of non-acceding provinces&quot;.   This avoids awkwardquestions about currency etc

(f) Paragraph 6 of your telegram:    I agree with your revisedwords &quot;in respect of the Union&quot;, but point out that, if the signature of the treaty is a pre-requisite to the acceptanceof the agreed constitution we are again open to the chargeof obstruction in order to protect our own interests - but you are fully aware of my own dilemma on this point.(g) Paragraph&apos;7 of your telegram: I have suggested a redraftin paragraph 9 (a) of this telegram.(h) Paragraph 8 of your telegram - vide my comments inparagraph 9 (c) of this telegram.(i) Paragraph 9 of your telegram.    I prefer the originalwording.   The revised wording is too reminiscent of pastcontroversy.    In particular I strongly urge avoiding term&quot;good government.&quot;   It will give great and avoidable offence.I suggest therefore &quot;must inevitably bear the responsibilityfor India&apos;s defence and responsibility for her internalstability.&quot;11. I will try to send some further comments in time for your meeting of March 2nd evening.

Copy of telegram from Governor-General dated2nd March,   I9h2.SECRET   XXXMOST IMMEDIATE.50U-S.      With reference to -paragraph No. 11 of my telegram i-j-97-8 of 2nd March,   I now send for urgent consideration the following further point of importance.2.    With further reference to paragraph 3 of yourtelegram 3332 ,   I would retain original wording (powerto formulate a new Constitution for India), &quot;but would addthe following sentence:- &quot;it will &quot;be for that &quot;body so to achieve its task as to ensure that authority of result ofthis system of Government would not he directly denied by large and powerful elements in India&apos;s national life&quot;..1 feel- strongly that offer of local option,  whileadequate to meet the case of Moslems in the Provinceswhere they are in a majority is no substitute for our existing pledges in the eyes of Moslems elsewhere,    f&quot;orinstance in United Provinces where Communal feeling isparticularly bitter,   or of other minorities like Sikhs.,Scheduled Castes and backward communities who have alsoregarded the undertakings given in August,  1940,  as a charter of their rights.     It is therefore necessary toreiocat some of the language of those undertakings in sucha way as to link up with our new pledge to accept andimplement &quot;the Constitution so framed&quot;.3.    Sub-paragraph (c) of Draft Declaration, cuts straightacross our promise to let Indians themselves agree on form which -post-war constituent body should take.      the qualifying phrase beginning &quot;paragraph No.  1 leaders ofIndian opinion&quot; is without pra.ctical effect since nocommunity or interest would agree upon any alternative method which gave it less representation than under our proposals,  while many would agitate for more.    Therefore*   .       I propose substituting for this sub-paragraph thefollowing:-    &quot;the character of the Constitution making bodyshall be such as may be agreed amorg representativeIndians and that H.-M.G.  will meanwhile seek to promotesuch agreement among tfcweasau      In its absence,  however,within 6 months after cessation of hostilities,  H. M.G.themselves undertake to set up representative bodyreflecting as far as British India is concerned composition of lower houses of provincial legislatures as resultingfrom elections which will be held as soon as hostilitiesC arc ended.   .Indian States would be invited to appoint representatives in same proportion.to total populationas average of British India&quot;. This also meets importantobjection that according to draft declaration british india may change,  by agreement,   the basis of constituentbody,   the States have no such latitude.      The point may be.immaterial in practice but is important as a matter of prestige.        As a consequential amendment,  first sentence of

a rtsub-paragraph (a) would read:- &quot;immediately uponcessation of hostilities steps shall be taken to set upin India&quot; ........        In any case phrasing of declarationmust allow for possible delay in provincial elections forclimatic reasons.h.    if however H.M.G.  feel that in order to addprecision to our undertakings they must go into detailsabout constituent body,   I would recall your attention to paragraph No.   5 of my telegram No.   32h-S of 15th Februaryin which I criticised method of election &quot;by singleelectoral college comprising all Provincial Lower houses and expressed my preference for alternative procedure which you had adumbrated.      I presume that intention ofH.M. Gi.  is(a) to secure a body of all India prestige ratherthan a collection of provincial coteries;  and(b) by keeping electoral college large and morescattered to lessen opportunities forjerrymandering (though these would stillsubsist).5.    I would also like it to be made clear,   if anydetails are to be propounded now,   that non-members of provincial Legislatures would be eligible as candidates for election to constituent body.
