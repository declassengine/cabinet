Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1942.SECRET. / Copy NoW.P. (42) 80.February 14, 1942.WAR CABINET.GREECE:  THE BLOCKADE.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.ON the 12th January the Cabinet decided that one cargo of 8,000 tons ofwheat should be sent to Greece to alleviate conditions in that country, though itwas made clear that this decision did not commit us to send further shipments to Greece or to make any concessions to other enemy-occupied countries. Theagreement of the United States Government was obtained and the decision was announced in Parliament on the 27th January, coupled with a precise statement that blockade policy remained unchanged. The 8,000 tons of wheat will probablybe shipped from Haifa before the end of this month in a ship withdrawn from our war service for the purpose, the wheat being drawn from the Middle EastSupply Centre, from which it can only be spared with the greatest difficulty.2. This concession by no means satisfies the Greek Government, and theGreek Prime Minister has even hinted that he may resign if further shipmentsare not allowed. Meanwhile, the famine in Greece continues, and all reports indicate that deaths from starvation are frequent. I suggest, therefore, that asan exceptional case further shipments of wheat or flour to Greece should bed, though the objections to allowing relief through the blockade tothe other occupied countries are as strong as ever.3. In my opinion the worst possible policy in relation to relief is to makepiecemeal concessions. These involve allowing unconditional and therefore entirelyuncontrolled shipments; upsetting the programme of the Middle East SupplyCentre; temporarily withdrawing tonnage urgently needed for our own war service; and setting a precedent for uncontrolled relief which can be invoked byother occupied countries. We should therefore decide our policy in advance andlay down strict conditions for any further relief shipments to Greece. Inparticular, we should, in order to save our shipping resources, insist that futureshipments shall be made in neutral ships (not now under Allied charter) and with neutral crews, and that these ships shall be given safe conducts enabling them togo to the country where the wheat is produced and carry it direct to Greece. Asuggestion that the Axis should be made to release Greek ships under their control for the proposed shipments has been examined but rejected because there are notmany of these vessels, they are in bad condition, and their tonnage is unsuitable.There are, I am informed, a number of suitable Swedish ships in the Baltic, andI hope it may be possible to induce the Swedish Government to allow them tobe chartered for Greek relief, and also to encourage the Swedish Red Cross toundertake the work of distribution in Greece under the auspices of the Inter-national Red Cross. The Greek Prime Minister has asked for 33,000 tons amonth, which is about the total average import in normal years. There can beno question of our undertaking to supply so large an amount. In any case, thequantity to be supplied under the scheme now proposed must be governed by theshipping available. To give an example, regular shipments of 15,000 tons amonth would, I understand, require not less than 6 ships of 5,000 tons grosstonnage each.11639   [23465]
24. The conditions which I suggest should be laid down will be found in the annex to this paper. They need careful consideration, as, in my opinion, nothing would be more fatal than to lay down conditions and then modify them as a resultof humanitarian pressure following upon a German refusal to accept them.5. I suggest that we should seek the concurrence of the United StatesGovernment in our proposals. We should then consult the Swedish Government,and, if they were prepared to assist the Greeks by supplying ships and super-vising distribution, we should ask the International Red Cross (who are therecognized intermediary in these matters) to seek German and Italian concurrence.We could then make a public statement on the subject.6. I understand that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs is in generalagreement with this paper, but that he wishes to comment on the proposedconditions.H.
