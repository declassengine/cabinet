HISSECRET.W.P.(42)89.17TH FEBRUARY,  1942.ycovY NO..WAR CABINET.TJNKTTnTjWn^^ TAX 0N WEEKLY WAGE-EARNERS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The working of the existing scheme for the deduction of income tax from wages has been under review for sometime past by a departmental committee which has inparticular considered the two main points against whichcriticism has been levelled, namely:-1.    The delay in bringing deductions into force whichhas resulted in many cases in deduction notcommencing at the first pay day in the 24-weeklyperiod of deduction;    and2.    The point stressed by the Minister of&apos;Labour and national Service, that in the case of seasonalemployments where the earnings in the summer areat a higher level than the earnings in the   winterthe high tax corresponding to the summer pay is inpart recoverable from the low pay of winter months.This review has made considerable, progress and i hope that I shall be able in my Budget speech to announcesome changes, the details of which will take into accountwhat is known of the views of the TcU.C.  and the employers.I shall be very happy to take the Minister of Labour and national Service into consultation as soon as I have completed my consideration of the whole topic and am in aposition to formulate my Budget proposals.    So far as thequestion relates to the incidence of the tax in the caseof high summer earnings and low winter earnings the issuedoes not arise until next January   when, under the existing scheme,  tax would fall to be deducted in respect of the(earnings for the six months to the 5th October,  1942.$There san be no question of altering the deductions that;are now being made in the current six months commencing;I on the 1st January last.While I do not wish at the moment to enter into any discussion of the merits of the various changes that are under consideration I must say that it seems fairly clearthat a scheme under which the deduction of tax would b-directly related to the amount of the current earnings&quot;is quite impracticable,, ^8**

7fiT-he Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (W.P.(42)78)raises two issues which are independent of the working ofthe Tax Deduction Scheme and relate rather to the measureof the liability, namely - taxation of overtime earnings andthe taxation of married women in employment.    The secondissue is one which I have already under consideration and2 expect to be able to deal with it in the forthcoming Budget.The other issue is the issue which has been raised by theClydesidej      The National Shipbuilding Shop Stewards have proposed that overtime earnings be free of income tax.    I am not prepared to entertain a proposal for the exemption of overtime pay, and I see no ground on which it could bemaintained that overtime pay should be relieved from thesame charge of income tax as applies to ordinary pay.     Piece-work earnings are another way of encouraging productionbut nobody would suggest that income tax should not be paid on such earnings.      The principle that no profit shouldbe made out of the war is applied in the case of the employerby taking away by the 100per cent. Excess Profits charge thewhole of the additional profit which may arise to him, and i see no reason why the similar earnings of the worker shouldbe relieved from an income tax charge which in no case exceedsa liability of 9/- in the  .I do not believe that labour generally would support a claim that the wage earner with a given income should pay lesstax than any other taxpayer of similar income and with theexception of the Shipbuilding Shop Stewards no representativesof labour have put forward a proposal for differentiating infavour of the wage-earner.      Indeed there have been norepresentations from organised labour (other than the ClydesideShop Stewards) regarding the working of the tax deduction scheme.Neither the T.U.C. nor any individual Trade Union has made anyprotest - but rather have given the scheme general support.      Ithink that the real grouse is no more than the grouse that incometaxpayers always have about the tax though in the end it iswillingly paid.    When one bears in mind the heavy increasemade in the income tax bill of all taxpayers and that thereare now about five and a half million liable wage-earnerswhereas last year there were only two and half millions - threemillion new payers - one might have feared a much more widespread and serious complaint.      In fact the complaint is local and individual rather than general.Finally, as regards the working of the tax&apos;deductionscheme it-must not be forgotten that the tax deduction schemespreads over six months a burden of tax which was ordinarilypayable in one sum and could have been spread only over threemonths under the method of paying by stamps that hithertoobtained.      The spread of six months tax over six months for3fti?8 t0n h?f ^ the main claim of the wo^er that the taxshould be collected in a manner that recognises the weeklyouaget.      There may be rough edges still to be smoothed outw?r.?^eS Wh-8 the e is a biS difference between summer andllTstnteZ^SS, anVhi?.ls of the matters that I hale at-fitsent under consideration,(Intldo)    K.-W.Peat George Street, S.W.lo,17TH FEBRUARY, 1942.
