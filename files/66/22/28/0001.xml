Printed for the War Cabinet,  February 1942.MOST SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (42) 98.February 24, 1942.at care may be taken tiiof this documentR LOOK AND KEY,WAR CABINET.PRESENT SITUATION IN RUSSIA AND RUSSIAN MILITARY PLANS.I CIRCULATE herewith a translation of a report dated the 14th February,1942, by Colonel Pika, head of the Czechoslovak Military Mission to Russia,which I think may be of interest to my colleagues in the War Cabinet. In viewof the source of this report, I should be grateful if the information which it contains might be treated as most secret.Foreign Office, February 24, 1942.Report by the Head of the Czechoslovak Military Mission to Russia.THE Russian advance at Leningrad has been slowed down, because the.Germans have now a fairly solid defence in depth, built up for several months,both on the west bank of the Volchoff and especially on the line Krasnaya-Gorka-Pushkin-Kolpino-Schlusselburg. The acquisition by the Russians of severalcentres of resistance at Kolpino and the slow advance in the direction of Kala-Vishera-Luga have so far not relieved Leningrad, and the encirclement of thatcity continues. In the last few days very intensive attempts have been made to effect a decisive break-through.  I cannot guarantee a quick success.2. On the whole the Russian advance in the centre zone continues well. Inspite of this, the Germans have succeeded in bringing up reserves quickly inorder to right the situation. They have destroyed several Russian infiltrationunits which had penetrated farthest in the direction of Valikie Luki, south ofthe western Dvina, and at Zukovka and by strong counter-attacks have recapturedseveral of the lost places. In this way they have prevented the encirclement ofViazma and here, too, they have slowed down the Russian advance so that theyhave been able to remove equipment farther and in the whole of this directionare withdrawing quite regularly.3. The Germans are beginning to get used to the new fighting methods ofthe Russians. For the winter period they have resorted to the tactics of organising independent, circular, fortified points in small localities withcommunications with powerful mobile reserves. These reserves carry outcounter-attacks on the Russian infiltration units penetrating to their positionsor to their rear. The Russians are therefore changing their methods. They noworganise infiltration units everywhere in several directions. Several of these units hold up the German reserves; the others widen the success. Every deeperpenetration, however, imposes on the Russians a considerable amount of re-formation of forces and of transport of material. In the centre zone theinitiative is still constantly in Russian hands. The Russians are bringingup heavy tanks of the Voroshiloff type (50 tons) and further units.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.A. E.11653   [23500]
24; On t!he southern front the offensive towards Dnepropetrovsk continuesslowly, but successfully. On the south-western sector of the front (Voronesh) newreserves are now arriving.5. There are two main reasons for the slowing down of the Russian offensive operations : (a) The bringing up of German reserves and the tactics of the fortified posts.The Germans build their defences very quickly and force ruthlesslythe civil population to carry out all the ground work. They use houses and tanks as forts with barbed-wire entanglements and mine fields.(5) The exceptionally severe winter of this year which prevents not only theGermans but also the Russians from developing strategic operations on a large scale, because the transport of equipment and supplies is dependent on communications which are blocked by snow-drifts.Apart from the main roads, there are no means of transport except by sleigh. For these reasons the encircling movements of the ski unitscannot penetrate deeply even if the way is cleared for them by sappersand tanks, and even if light artillery oan be brought up. Likewise,the cavalry divisions can operate in depth only with great difficulty,because they cannot find fodder for their horses and because the delivery of supplies by sledge is little developed.(c) The most serious problem of winter operations in Russia is railwaytransport, which, from our point of view, is beset with immeasurabledifficulties. At times when there are forty to fifty degrees of frost. railway communication often ceases almost entirely. It is thereforetruly wonderful how, in spite of these obstacles, the Russians manageto keep the units at the front well supplied from distant centres, and operations continue regularly.(d) The activity of the Russian air force was restricted in January by the- *   weather.6. The Russians are trying to remove these difficulties. In order to provide further means for delivering supplies, they are extending the use of motor sleighsfitted with propellers. Their winter equipment and their experience enable themto be always active, and they will quite certainly continue their offensive opera-tions. For March the Supreme Command has special reserves who are still being trained on skis. At the present moment ski units are being sent with daily:regularity to the front.7.   With regard to future operations, I can report the following : -(a) The immediate objective to-day is Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozie and the clearing of the railway line Orel-Kursk-Charkoff. Apart from these operations, which are already in course of action, that is in theDonets basin and in the direction of Smolensk, the next most pressingaction is the relief of Leningrad, which is now in a critical position.The food situation of the besieged is weak enough; certain rawmaterials for war industry are running short and the whole questionof supply presents great practical difficulties. An attempt to sendheavy war material over the frozen Lake Ladoga failed, because the ice broke. The population are enduring a terrible winter, and thereis no fuel at all.The Russian Command originally planned a big operation in theVelikie-Luga-Riga direction with a supporting operation in thedirection of Staraya Rusa-Pskoff. This was meant to cut off theGerman armies in Esthonia and Latvia and to clear the wholeLeningrad district. In view of the fact that the advance at Cholm.has been slowed down, the operation now in course from Lake Ilmanto Kingisepp is restricted, and the original strategic plan will haveto be carried out in stages.(&amp;) A second large operation is to be undertaken on the Southern front afterthe Dnieper is reached. With this object in view considerableconcentrations of armies and of transport are already beingcarried out.
8. The winter season, which is the most favourable to the Russians, lasts inthe central and northern zones (from Kursk to Leningrad) up to about the endof April; in the south until the end of March. The whole striking strength ofthe German spring offensive will depend on the result of the Russian winteroperations. If the Russians can succeed with a deep pincer movement whereby the Germans lose a large amount of mechanised material which could not bereplaced before the spring, the German offensive would have smaller chances ofsuccess. All information received up to now shows that the Germans have beenable to remove a fairly large part of their heavy material in time. The majorityof the tank divisions, which, however, have been perceptibly weakened, have been withdrawn behind the front and are being reorganised for the spring. The tankscaptured by the Russians are mainly tanks used as block-houses for defence purposes. Moreover, it seems to the Russians that the Germans are sparing theirLuftwaffe for the spring offensive.9. The Soviet authorities have no illusions about the difficulties and the considerable dangers of the German spring offensive, even although they are full of confidence and are themselves making feverish preparations both for defence and for their own offensive operations.
