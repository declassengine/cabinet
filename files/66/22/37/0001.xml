TO 3E KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may he taken to ensurethe secrecy of this document.SECRET.   ,17.P.q4-2) 1072nd March 1942. v/AR   CABINETINDIAN   POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India, covering a note by Major-General R.M.M. Lcckhart, C.I.E., 11.C.I circulate for consideration a note by my Military Secretary,Ma jor-Goneral Lockhart, in regard to the probable effect on theViceroy&apos;s Commissioned Officers and Other Ranks- of the Indian Army ofthe proposed Declaration.L.S.A.INDIA OPE ICE,2nd March, 194-2.Note by Major-Gcnerai Lockhart.Effect on the Indian personnel of the Indian army of changes in India&apos;s Constitution.&apos; .This note is based on the assumption that both Congress and the muslim League are reasonably satisfied by the proposed declaration and that neither party ia induced by it to make any attempt to stir up agitationamongst the masses.Nevertheless, a declaration of this sort cannot fail to reach andhave an effect on the Indian soldier overseas as well as in India, and this note attempts to assess the Immediate effect.2, The classes from which the Indian Army is drawn oanriot begeographically divided into tidy provincial packets.     Although the bulkof Mohammedans come from the N.W.F.P. and the Punjab, Rajput ana. CentralIndia, the United provinces, Bihar and Madras all contribute theThe Punjab contributes large numbers of Hindus (Dogras, Jats, Ahirs andGujars) as well as Sikhs.     The Gurkha battalions constitute an important and entirely separate element.It is not possible to gauge the particular reactions of particularCopy No,

classes till the reception given in India to the Declaration is known:    butit is not impossible to foresee the immediate general effect on the army as a whole.3. The Indian soldier is a volunteer,for, put from another angle, amercenary,     &quot;/hat he fights for, as such, is his pay and the means of subsistence it provides for his family, and also the rewards which he hasbeen-accustomed to look for from the hands of the British Raj, if he conductshimself well in war, in the shape of pension, gratuities and grant of land.But over and above that, being drawn from classes which have a long martialtradition, he fights because he takes a pride in the soldier&apos;s profession,of which a leading element is his personal loyalty to his British officersand a general loyalty to the British Raj which they represent, and which hetakes a pride in serving.Any indication, such as the Declaration portends, of a fundamental change in the conditions under which he has accepted service - whether as affecting his material prospects or his creed as -a soldier of the BritishCrown - cannot fail to have at once an unsettling effect.L, The &quot;Indian soldiers&apos;experiences in the troubles in 1931 and underCongress provincial rule since 1937 have led many of them to believe that  .Congress is inimical to the martial classes.There is therefore every reason to suppose that the general reaction of the Indian soldier, .whether Moslem or Hindu, to a pronouncement that- thegovernment of India was to be placed in the hands of Indians - which he would naturally assume to be the hands of the majority community - would be one ofgreat apprehension as to his own future and, more, that of his family.     Hewill not at once understand the implications, as they affect himself, of the&quot;contracting out&quot; proposal:   but when he does it will have an equallydisturbing effect according to the area from which he comes..5. Much of the foregoing does not fully apply to the Gurkha sepoy whoreturns home to Nepal on completion of service and whose family are in Nepal.But he too is a professional soldier and is inspired by a loyalty to theBritish Sarkar, into whose service he has, entered, as complete, during his service, as that which he owes to his own Maharajah,     It is to, the BritishCrown-,-and not to any Indian Government, that he offers his professionalallegiance:    and any idea, however, ill-founded on a close reading of theDeclaration, that he is to transfer this allegiance -will Inevitably upset hissomewhat childish mentality.6. It must further be remembered that -any pronouncement made will reach the Indian soldier accompanied and followed by a host of rumours andexaggerations.     These will augment his natural apprehensions and, in thecase of the soldier overseas at least,- it is difficult to see how the effecton his morale can be anything but adverse.-     In India itself -it seems certainthat the proposed announcement will lead to greatly increased political activity and manoeuvring for position with a view to obtaining&apos; adequate representation as a result of the elections, to be held on the conclusion ofhostilitJ.es.     Such political activity must react -upon the soldier.     It maywell result in a reluctance to enlist or, at least,&apos;- in a reluctance to serveoverseas, i ..    , &apos;The only hope of allying the soldiers&apos;  apprehensions would be to postpone any.announcement until a campaign of propaganda to condition his mind to the shape of things to come has had time to take effect.       &apos;- -\7. I recognise that the constitutional proposals in the Declaration are notto begin to be put into operation until-after the war is won, and that thepurpose of the Declaration is to induce a spirit of - bo-operation which will ensure the maximum war effort by India,     It is not for me to say whether the

- 3 -support of those nor.- hanging back is likely to b.. forthcoming or would addsubstantially to India&apos;s war effort if it were:    but I feel it my duty toexpress the conviction that so far as concerns the Indian Army, the effectof the declaration will be to create grave apprehensions in the minds ofthe Indian soldiers and thereby (i) to induce a hesitation to enlist anda reluctance to leave India for service overseas, and (ii) to affectadversely the morale and the fighting efficiency of the Indian troopsalready overseas.R.M.M.L.2nd March, 1942.
