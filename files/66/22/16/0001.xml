DRAFT HOTiS TO THE VICHY .QOVBRHMBUTH.M.G. have more than once in the past pointed out to the Government of Marshal Petain the vital contribution whichis being made to the war effort of their enemies by Frenchseaborne trade and French industries0    Until recently H.M.G. hadgrounds for thinking that the assistance given to their enemiesby French ships, was for the most part, confined to the carriage of valuable ores and other raw materials to France for subsequenttransport to Germany and Italy.    Damaging although this contrabandtrade is to the war effort of the Free Allied Nations, consideration for the difficulties of France and of French seamen has hithertorestrained H.M.G. from taking the drastic action necessary tobring it to an end.It has now come to the notice of H.M.G.  that a numberof French merchant vessels have recently been employed for the carriage of military supplies and equipment from France to Tuniswhence they are being transported over land to the Axis Forcesin Libya.   Six ships known to be employed in this manner are theSo a, STE, ETIENNE, STE.  GERMAINE, STE. MARCELLE, NANTAIS,KABZLE and BOUGARONI, and further ships have been reported to beloading Axis military supplies in French ports.    In addition theFrench tanker PORT ST. LOUIS recently carried a consignment of petrol to Algiers, which was subsequently sent over land to fuelthe Axis motorised units in Libya.H.M.G. cannot be expected to acquiesce in the use ofFrench cargo ships and tankers as military transports carryingsupplies and equiprnent-jbo the Forces of their enemies in thefield.    They therefore give.notice that if any of the French shipsnamed in this note, or any other ships similarly employed, areencountered by British Naval or Air Forces anywhere within theMediterranean, they will be attacked without further warning.Only when H.M.G. are satisfied that all French ships have been withdrawn from this employment will these orders be countermanded.H.M.G, also had occasion in their note of last november to point out the dangers caused to legitimate French shippingengaged in the domestic trade of Tunis by the fact that Italiansupply ships frequently wear French colours and sail in close proximity of bona fide French ships.    British Naval and Air forces have, so far, conscientiously endeavoured to distinguish betweenenemy supply ships and bona fide French ships.    It is obvioushowever that the use of French ships as Axis military transportsin the waters off Tunisia has brought all French ships in thesewaters under the deepest suspicion and in these circumstances ifany bona fide French ships are attacked in these waters whether by day or night, it is clear that the responsibility will not be with .M.G. u^
