Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1942.W.P. (42) 96.February 24, 1942.SECRET./Copy No.-*TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS RUSSIA.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith copies of the two telegrams whichwere addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington (Nos. 931 and 932of the 10th February) in accordance with War Cabinet Conclusions 18 (42),item 2; a copy of a further telegram addressed to Lord Halifax recording a conversation with the Soviet Ambassador (No. 1053 of the 14th February); and copies of two telegrams received from Lord Halifax in reply (Nos. 971 of the19th February and 1013 of the 20th February).(No. 931.   Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, February 10, 1942.My telegram No. 6707 of the 4th December last gave you an account of thecircumstances which led up to my visit to Moscow later in that month and of line I proposed to take in my conversations with Stalin. From the repetitionssent to you of my telegrams from Moscow in the Hectic series you have an ideaof what passed during those conversations. United States Government have alsobeen kept informed of situation through you and through United states ambassador here.2. Since my return from Moscow we have been considering ways and meansof dealing with Stalin&apos;s demand for recognition of his 1941 frontiers in Finland,the Baltic States and Roumania. The United States Government may wellconsider his demand difficult to understand, for if, at the end of the war, heoccupied these territories, it is not to be supposed that we should turn him out,and, if he does not, he cannot expect that we shall prolong hostilities to installhim there. It is our belief, however, that his demand^ an awkward one tosatisfy is put to us as a test of sincerity of our avowed desire to work withhim during and after the war. It is the fruit of a long period of suspicion andmisunderstandng.3. A simple refusal to meet him would involve the risk that Anglo-soviet relations will deteriorate and that co-operation between Great Britain and Russia,and between the United States of America and Russia, both during and afterthe war, may be seriously endangered.A. E.Foreign Office, February 24, 1942.11646   [23498]b
24. In Moscow I had to tell Stalin that it was altogether beyond my powerto accede to his request, and I explained to him that this was due not only toour position but also to that-of the United States, to whom we were bound by certain undertakings, apart from our joint promulgation of the atlantic charter. Under pressure from Stalin I could not refuse to consult the UnitedStates Government, and I therefore wish you now to put the whole situationbefore them so that we may determine our joint policy in the matter.5. StalhVs attitude is that, before Hitler forced him into war by anunjustified aggression, he was in possession of these territories. He would main-tain that his title to them is no more open to question than was that of the TsaristGovernment (with whom we were in treaty and friendly relations). He asks thatthe frontiers which Hitler violated shall be restored. (Note that the Polish-Soviet frontier is not at the moment in question.) He says, by implication if notin so many words, that he would expect an Ally to allow him, who has beenbearing the brunt of the war for seven months, to expect to regain his own- territory. I do not want to overstate his case : there are obvious answers, which do not carry much weight with him.6. I used the Atlantic Charter as an argument against him. He pointed tothe &quot; plebiscites &quot; in the Baltic States. Our exchanges of views on this aspect of the subject would have been even less profitable than they were if I had suggested that those &quot; plebiscites &quot; were faked.7. But there is the difficulty. Is it possible to comply with Stalin&apos;s demandwithout doing violence to the Atlantic Charter, and without raising a crop ofother demands from other quarters ? If so, that is, from the point of view ofthe relations of our two countries with the Soviet Government, the solution weshould seek.8. If we cannot, is it wise to offer Stalin a part, only, of what he wants?I am advised by Sir S. Cripps (and our experience of 1939, as you will remember,would tend to confirm this) that any appearance of haggling may only increasehis suspicions.   But I am apprehensive of the effect of a fiat negative.9. If the United States Government feel that it is impossible to grant hisfull demand despite its very real significance for co-operation with the SovietGovernment, now and in the future, are there any any other offers that wecould make?10.   I would make two possible suggestions : (a) We might say that, while we cannot agree now to restoration of 1941frontiers, we and the United States could immediately give assurances that on grounds of Soviet security we would support, when the time comes, a demand by the Soviet Government to establish Soviet bases in territories contiguous to Russia, and especially on the Baltic and black Seas from which her security might be threatened.  Acceptance. : by Soviet Government of such assurances would not preclude them::\      from putting forward at the peace conference their claim to absorb the Baltic States, Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina and parts of,     Finland.   We and the United States Government for our part would remain free from any previous undertaking either to accept or rejectsuch a claim if put forward at the peace settlement.    (Idea of-establishment of military bases by one country in territory of anotheris one which United States Government itself has put into operation.It is one which may^e developed after the war by various countries,and it is one which Soviet Government, in the case of the Baltic states in 1939, was the first to put into practice.   While giving Stalintangible asset in respect of his security needs, it does not derogatefrom principles of Atlantic Charter.)(b) We might put forward proposal in your letter to the Prime Minister. ,: of the 11th January, substituting following final passage: &quot; . . . .&quot; ;.,, &apos;,; and in order to reconcile your security requirements and our common!,&apos;,     , obligations under Atlantic Charter, we would undertake here and nowto support you at the peace settlement if you demand that foreign..&apos;:        policy in defence of Baltic States shall be entrusted to Soviet Union,..:: , ;:    who for this purpose shall be entitled to exercise such authority andto establish such control as may be necessary on territory of baltic states.&quot;
11. These two offers are based, as any offers clearly must be, on requirementsof Russian &quot; security,&quot; for which Soviet Union have been striving ever since1917 Revolution in order that Soviet Government may be enabled to completeunfinished social and economic experiment within Russia without danger offoreign intervention or war.12. Of these two, it seems to me there might be a possibility of the UnitedStates Government being prepared to agree to (a), and if they would associate themselves with it, it might be that this wrould satisfy Stalin. He might not accept any compromise offer from us alone, but it is possible that he might feelthat a joint offer by ourselves and the United States Government was of real value and a step towards co-operation during and after the war with our twoGovernments. Moreover, (a) would not exclude the possibility of Stalin obtainingat the peace conference the frontiers he desires : it would be an instalment ratherthan an alternative.13. One point of difficulty is Lithuania, since Polish Government, who are anxious for a Polish-Lithuanian union after the war, have expressed to us desire that no negotiation as regards future disposal of Lithuanian territory should be entered into without consultation with them. Polish views are, of course, incom-patible with Soviet plans to annex Lithuania and with proposal (&amp;), though theymight be reconciled with proposal (a). In any case, Poland&apos;s aim in regard toLithuania is only practical from geographical point of view if she obtained fromSoviet Government frontier with Russia considerably east of Curzon line orpermission to annex East Prussia, to which M. Stalin told me he would be pre-pared to agree. Poland has no rights in Lithuania on the basis of the atlantic charter and she would be unwise to show herself intransigent towards russian Lithuanian matters.14. It would not do to make any concession to Stalin without requiringsuitable quid pro quo and by insisting on any concessions made to him being partof bargain we should establish rule that concession must be mutual, thus making-it more difficult for Soviet Government to press subsequently for yet further concessions.   Demands we might make on Soviet Government are (i) Affirmation by Soviet Government that they will base their policy on principles contained in declaration by President Roosevelt and PrimeMinister that they &quot; seek no aggrandisement, territorial or other,&quot; andM. Stalin&apos;s statement on the 6th November, 1941, that Soviet Govern-ment had no intention of interfering in internal affairs of other people.(ii) Formal Soviet approval of principle of confederation as applied toweaker countries of Europe, especially in Balkans and as regardsPoland and Czechoslovakia,(iii) Undertaking by Soviet Government to collaborate with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government and other countries of Europe in preparing for reconstruction of Europe after the war&quot;with full regard to each other&apos;s interests and in accordance withthe two principles (see (i) above) of no aggrandisement and no inter-ference.&quot; Objectives of reconstruction would include safeguardingand strengthening of economic and political independence of all european countries, either as unitary or confederated States, and reconstruction of industrial and economic life of countries whoseterritories have been overrun by Germany or her associates.15. Should President agree to tripartite basis of agreement, he may haveUnited States desiderata to put forward.16. My immediately following telegram contains analysis of wider.issues involved, which you may find useful in discussion with the President.&apos;       (2)    -    ;.        -   &apos;V; ; vMr. Eden to Viscount Halifax (Washington).(No. 932.) ;;.(Telegraphic.) -   . Foreign Office, February 10s 1942,On the assumption that Germany is defeated, that German military strength is destroyed and that France remains for a considerable period at least a weak[23498] B 2
Power, there will be no counterweight to Russia in Europe, but co-operation withRussia will be desirable (a) Because she might otherwise be tempted to collaborate with Germany,in view of historical tendency to and economic urge for these Powersto work together.(b) In order that we may re-create in our own interest balance of power inEurope destroyed by collapse of France, against possibility of revivedGermany.(c) In order that, militarily speaking, Germany should be encircled.2. Probable course of Soviet policy must depend upon course of war and -its effect upon U.S.S.R., condition in which latter emerges from war and circum-stances in which war is terminated. We cannot be certain that German defeatmay not be brought about principally by Russian action before our own and american war potential is fully developed. In that event Russian prestigewould be enormous, and Soviet Government would be tempted to work for establishment of Communist Governments in majority of European countries.Russians might, moreover, be in a position to denude German factories of equipment needed to restore Russian industry, and, becoming in this way to considerable extent independent of British and American assistance, might nolonger desire to adapt themselves to policies which we and the United States may wish to pursue. This possible development is in itself a powerful reason for establishing close relations with Russia while her policy is still in a fluid state,in order to exercise as much influence as possible on her future course of action.It would be unsafe to gamble on Russia emerging so exhausted from the war thatshe will be forced to collaborate with us without our having to make any conces-sions to her. On the contrary, common prudence requires us to lay our plans on the assumption that, if we want Russian collaboration after the war, we shallhave to be prepared to make such a policy advantageous to her. Application ofthis policy will be laborious and length process. If we are to adopt it, we muststart how, and not wait until the war is over.3. We must therefore recognise that our refusal to satisfy Stalin&apos;s demandmay be the end of any prospect of fruitful co-operation with the SovietGovernment in our mutual interests, and may cause Soviet policy to revert to the pursuit of purely selfish aims with incalculable consequences for the post-war period. There is also important point of particular and immediate interest to united States, that our present answer to Stalin&apos;s demand may later on affectRussian decision whether or no to make war on Japan.4. There is little doubt that Soviet Government is suspicious lest our policyof close collaboration with United States Government will be pursued at expenseof Russian interests and that we aim at an Anglo-American peace and post-war world. Soviet Government will therefore be likely to use our response to Stalin&apos;demand as touchstone of Anglo-American attitude towards them. It seems to us that right method both of meeting this suspicion and of guarding so far as maybe possible against risk of Russia following entirely independent policy is toemphasise to Soviet Government that, in matters concerning war and peace aims,we and the United States Government would wish to work for tripartiteconsultations with them and to reach tripartite solutions.5. It must be remembered that Stalin might have asked for much more,e.g., control of the Dardanelles, spheres of influence in the Balkans, one-sidedimposition on Poland of Russo-Polish frontier, access to Persian Gulf, access to Atlantic involving cession of Norwegian territory. Stalin&apos;s present demand,it is true, may not be final, but he may later be in a position to enforce a Claimto some or all of these, and we and United States Government would be in stronger ftposition to assert our views if we have established precedent of tripartiteagreements in regard to post-war arrangements^ and if Soviet Government have J)not decided to go ahead without regard to our views owing to our giving anentirely negative reply to present demands. Moreover, from strategic point ofview, it may well be sound that Russia should be established once again in theBaltic, so as to be able better to dispute with Germany the naval command of thatsea than was the case since 1918. Stalin would certainly not admit that hisdemands are in conflict with principles of Atlantic Charter, and he may wellbe satisfied by nothing short of complete acceptance of his demands.
Mr. Eden to Viscount Halifax (Washington).(No. 1053.   Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, February 14, 1942.Soviet Ambassador asked me on 12th February what the position wasregarding Stalin&apos;s demand for 1941 frontiers. I replied that we had already putproblem to United States Government.Ambassador asked whether we had made it clear to United States Govern-ment that they were not being asked themselves to agree to Russian demand. Itwas with us that Soviet Government wished to make treaty, and United StatesGovernment were only required not to object. I said we attached much importanceto views of United States Government and were most anxious to move in step with them. I added, and Ambassador agreed, that it would be much more valuableto Soviet Government if action was taken by both His Majesty&apos;s Government and united States Government.I told Ambassador that variety of answers by United States Governmentwas possible. They might agree to Soviet proposal and would wish to join with us in expressing such agreement; they might say that they did not agree and hoped we would not agree; or they might say that they had no strong views and that it was for us to decide. In last event we should have to examine thematter afresh.Ambassador feared effect in Moscow of long interval, since my return with-out any indication of our view. He asked how we had put the problem to theUnited States Government, and I made it plain that we had not put it in an^unfavourable light.(4)Viscount Halifax to Mr. Eden.    &apos;(No. 971.   Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, February 19, 1942.Your telegrams Nos. 931, 932 and 1053.I had the opportunity on 17th February of opening this subject with thePresident and discussing in greater detail yesterday with Welles.2. To the President I did not develop the argument at length as I merelywished at this stage to explore his mind and to tell him that I intended to take it up fully with Welles. The President began cautiously with reference to thedifficulty of the Atlantic Charter, but gradually developed an argument not unlike the compromise plan that I had put in my letter to the Prime Minister of11th January. The President thought that it was largely a question of presenta-tion, but that it would be undesirable to get into too much detail at this stagewhich would involve us both in a secret treaty, difficulties of which were obvious.But he thought that we might both assure Stalin of our general purpose, and perhaps throw out a hint of some such scheme as above. He said that AdmiralStandley would be going to Moscow shortly and that it would be useful for us tohave a talk a quatre President, Standley, Welles and nryself. The president was really thinking aloud and too much importance should not be attached to hisindications of opinion at the present stage.3. With Welles I got deeper. I gave him notes based on your two telegrams931 and 932 and quoted 1053 to emphasise the urgency. I laid stress on yourfeeling of the importance of our response for psychological effect on Stalin and developed the various arguments of your telegrams, reinforcing these by our experience of 1939 negotiations. I said that it might, of course, be argued thatthe best security for Stalin would consist in German disarmament, but whatever the merits of this argument, the present problem was not only to find a reply that was logical but one which satisfied Stalin.4. Welles said he must have time for reflection. He thought that it was most important question of policy that had arisen and was fully alive to its
urgency. He only spoke at present with great reserve, pending fuller considera-tion. His first reaction was not to like either of your alternative suggestions and he spoke about the necessity of building new world on principle if it wasnot again to crash sooner or later let us stick to the Atlantic Charter. If we gaveaway principles now, what would prevent an indefinite sequence of furtherRussian blackmail later ? If we once started subordinating peoples to a regimethey repudiated, we were sowing the seeds of trouble. He sometimes lookedforward to a divided Germany, which might minimise all these future dangersfor which we were now being pressed to make sacrifice of principle of doubtfulexpediency.5. All this seemed a bit remote and I told him that nobody could have been more loyal to the principle of self-determination than we had all been at Versaillesunder the leadership of President Wilson, but that that solution had not stood up against the stress of power politics, and that we should deceive ourselves if we thought that the new world would grow rapidly or by virtue of its ownunsupported high purposes. If it was essential, as surely it was, to keep Russiaright now and after the war, it was no good ignoring the realities of Stalin&apos;sexaggerated claims or suspicions.6. With this Welles mainly agreed in spite of what he had said earlier, andacknowledged the necessity of recognising Stalin&apos;s case for reassurance aboutsecurity. He thought it would be fair, and would perhaps be sound, to meet thisby some such action as you suggested in respect of the bases and was quite clearwe ought not to oppose a flat negative to Stalin&apos;s requests.7. We left it that he is to think it all over and discuss [group omitted 1 it]again in a few days&apos; time. Neither he nor the President was expressing anythingbut first reactions but it was curious that these differed in their preferencebetween your alternatives. I think on this sort of thing Welles&apos;s advice, whatever it is, will finally prevail.8. I told Welles that I was naturally aware of several commitments inaddition-to the Atlantic Charter, to which we should each have to have regardabout not recognising territorial changes effected by force or in advance of generalpeace settlement.(5)Viscount Halifax to Mr, Eden.(No. 1013.   Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, February 20, 1942.My telegram No. 971.1. Welles asked me to see him to-night, and said he had had full discussionwith the President, who is mildly indisposed and on whose instructions he spoke.2. After full consideration, the President did not like either of yoursuggestions. He felt that both were difficult to reconcile with the atlantic charter, and that it was premature to attempt detailed treatment of the problem.He was confident that he could reach agreement direct with Stalin, and proposed to set about doing so, through Litvinov in the first instance, supportingthis action through Standley.3. I said that, subject to what I say below, I supposed that you would feelnothing but satisfaction if the President could in fact reach agreement withStalin, but that I doubted whether he was not under-estimating the difficulties that you had personally encountered in Moscow. I then quoted to him one ortwo of the more pointed observations that Stalin and Molotov had made in yourconversations.But, apart from this, I said that I thought the Presidents proposedprocedure might place you in a difficult position. It was with us and not with[group undecypherable] that Stalin wished to sign a treaty, although Stalin had said that he understood the necessity of your referring to the Americans andwould be glad to have their assent.Welles said that he thought this gave the President an easy card of entry inthat he could say to Stalin that we had, as he knew, sought the opinion of theUnited States Government, and that on this the President was oonyeying hisopinion direct to Stalin.
4. I said that I hoped the President would postpone action until you had had a chance of saying anything you might wish to say, and that the president would tell us what he did say to Stalin if and when he said it.Welles said that he did not think that the President would be moving anyhowwithin the next few days, and possibly not for even rather longer, since he thoughthe would wish to discuss with Winant. The line he proposed to take is to say thathe entirely recognises the justice of Stalin&apos;s claim for security, and that this can be met in a variety of different ways, in regard to which it is difficult at this moment to take a final decision. He would certainly tell us what the president said to Stalin.5. The President has evidently gone back, on further reflection, from thegeneral attitude he expressed to me a few days ago, though Welles said that thePresident, in giving an indication of his mind to him, accepted the justice ofStalin&apos;s claim, for example, to have a wider geographical area between Leningradand possible attack.6. As I anticipated. I suspect that Welles&apos;s general view has had weightwith the President, and Welles is clearly much impressed with the policy of the atlantic Charter and of the effect on United States opinion if anything were doneeither by ourselves, or still more by the United States Government, that could berepresented as denying the principles for which the people of the United Statesthink they are fighting.This expression of feeling was accompanied by a strong assertion of his conviction of the absolute necessity of dealing radically, when the time comes,with the German problem. We must not allow ourselves to be deluded by a vainhope that the leopard could change his spots.He spoke with great feeling on the text that the people of the United states were just entering upon what he called an emotional cycle comparable to that ofrevolution, the civil war, or the last war, and that, while they would stop at nosacrifice for the principles that they thought would mean a better world, effect ofany apparent departure from these would be disastrous,7. I hope you will feel able to concur with apparent gratitude in thePresident making the attempt on which he has evidently decided.
