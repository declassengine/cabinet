C3RETff.pj42)90.&apos; COPY NO    ^\17TH FEBRUARY,  1942.W AR      CABINETTHE.MILLING RATIOMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, theSecretary of State for Scotland end the Secretary of Statefor the Home. Department.  .1. The loss of 600,000 tons of cereal feeding-stuffsper. annum,  through the adoption of 8570 extraction flour,would be bound to have adverse repercussions upon the outputof one or more of the commodities,milk, bacon and eggs.    WheatOffals are mainly used in the production of these three,commodities^    Beef and mutton are now produced from crops andgrass grown on the farm.2* It has been estimated that if the whole of this reduction of feeding-stuffs supplies were to fall on any oneof these products,   che home output might decline as followsTotal loss in Percentage reduction12 mths. in outputMilk .300 million gallons &apos; 25   -. .Bacon 60 thousand tons 37-g-Eggs 70 thousand tons 18These estimates,  especially that relating to eggs,are,probably well on the .low side.3. The lower quality of the remaining supply of wheatoffals.would accentuate the quantitative effect,.   It wouldals&apos;o give rise to serious problems in the administration ofthe Feeding-stuffs Rationing Scheme.4. Whatever steps were taken,  e.g. by drawing uponthe. existing limited reserve of maize and other devices, to mitigate for a few. months the effects on&quot; home production ofthis loss of 600,000 tons of feeding-stuffs, the full effectmust be felt in due course.    The shipping situation appears ..to offer no prospect of replenishing supplies by imports of maize, at .best until late in the year.;   Moreover, past experience suggests that any such imports must be regarded as very problematical.-5f  .... If the appropriate downward adjustment of rationswere made to apply to all three classes of stock, namely dairycows, pigs, and poultry,, the effects, would be mainly felt bymilk producers on marginal land or with intensively kept herdswho.can&apos;only provide a-relatively small part of their cows&apos;requirements from grass and crops of their own growing and bysmall specialist pig and poultry keepers.- . These are the verypeople who can least readily turn to other forms ofagricultural production and the decline in their output of milk,  eggs and pigmeat would in the main be a net loss.6. Some dairy, farmers will be able to offset a reducedration of purchased, feeding-stuffs by becoming more selfsufficient &quot;after next harvest.    Others however have reached their maximum capacity in this respect and a prospect of areduction in the quantity and quality of rationed feeding-stuffs,coming on top of the decision to extend the period of double summer time: and,coupled with the inevitable dissatisfaction,with the prices now;proposed will be bound to have an appreciateeffect on future milk output.
7. The loss of cereal feeding-stuffs.for milk production could he partly offset in England-and-&apos;-Wales    -:at all events, by making the maximum possible extension ofthe treatment of wheat and barley straw with ^qu^j,p-, fltrrhfi&apos;whereby its feeding value can be more than doubled.      this process requires the erection of concrete tanks a-hdo-a.. good&apos;supply of running water.      In spite of vigorous propaganda in the past year,  only a limited number of plants-, have been erected.      If the Government were prepared to finance theerection of such plants,  (as a war-time measures^since the.,i process is not one which would be necessary or economicalj in peace-rtime) it is estimated that five thousand (eachI costing  40) could be put up by next winter.      This &quot;would&apos;.-provide the equivalent of 50,000 tons of maize, -and if thegovernment bore the whole cost (as might be necessary),  thetotal expenditure would be about  200,000.8i If the War Cabinet decide that the need for savingshipping space is so urgent that the rate of extractionmust be increased,  the extension of the straw pulp processon the lines proposed is strongly recommended.9. At the meeting of the Lord President&apos;s Committee on 6th February,  the Minister of Food&apos;stated that he could not accept any loss of milk production and, we entirely sympathise with this attitude.      If, however,  a serious loss in milkoutput is to be avoided,  the whole of the cut in supplies of feeding-stuffs must be borne by pigs and poultry.      Thiswould involve a farther heavy reduction in rations for these classes of stock.10. Pig and poultry producers have already had to adapt themselves to severe cuts in the amount of&apos; purchased,feeding-stuffs which they can obtain.      Steps have beentaken during the past few months designed to enable them to stabilise their position at the -reduced level of productionnecessitated by war conditions.      The deterrent t-   productionin the prices for fat pigs was removed in the autumn.    Specialrations far chick rearing are being provided this spring tosecure an overdue supply of adequate replacements for egg--laying flocks.      The collection of kitchen waste is beingintensified with Exchequer support.     All these measures are designed to secure the maximum output of bacon and eggs from^me sources that our reduced resources will allow.   .11. A further arastic cut in rations would,  of course,mean that specialist and intensive producers would have toreduce their scale of production.      Many small specialists  .would be forced to cease production altogether.      In other cases, where intensive pig and poultry production iscarried on as a means of maintaining fertility for cropproduction (e.g.  in Devon and Cornwall) there would berepercussive effects on other forms of production   which cannotbe measured quantitatively but which nevertheless would beappreciable in certain areas.      It w-;Uld mean reduction incrops for direct human&apos;consumption, the tonnage of which wriiMhave to be made good by increased imports.12. The importation of maize&apos; and  other feeding-stuffs jlater in the year,  even if it then became a practicableproposition, would not avoid a cut in rations for pigs and poultry during the summer unless the Minister of Food wereprepared to withdraw his present objections to the&apos;   utilisation of- the existing maize reserve.      If the cut hadto take place, the damage would be done, for a year at all events.      Production of eggs and bacon can easily be lowered,but cannot be raised,  at short notice. -(Intld.) &quot; R.S,HvT.J.17th February,   1942. &apos; H.M. -
