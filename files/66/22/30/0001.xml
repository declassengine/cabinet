General Review.1. A German pocket battleship and an 8-inch cruiser have &quot;arrived atTrondheim.   The cruiser, while on passage, was damaged by submarine attack.An Italian convoy has arrived in Libya. Its passage was covered by a strongnaval force.A Japanese force making a landing at Bali was heavily and effectivelyattacked by sea and air.Attacks on shipping by U-boat in the West Indies and West Atlanticcontinue to be heavy, and losses have been considerable. Elsewhere, apart from some ships sunk during an air raid on Port Darwin, losses have been slight.Home Waters.2. E-boats were active off the Norfolk coast on the night of the 19th/20th.Two were sunk by destroyers on patrol and convoy escorts in the vicinity, and itis possible that two others were sunk or damaged. There was no damage to our forces. ,E-boats were also active in the Channel on the night 20th/21st, but werenot intercepted.An enemy force reported as two battleships and three cruisers with destroyerswas sighted by reconnaissance aircraft on the morning of the 21st west ofHorn Reefs. Owing to exceptionally bad weather our bomber and torpedo-carrying aircraft failed to locate them. Two battleships were reported by aBeaufighter off Stavanger on the morning of the 22nd and, in the afternoon these were identified as a pocket battleship and a Hipper Class cruiser which were thenoff Bergen. Two air striking forces were despatched but were unable to find them.Early on the 23rd H.M. Submarine Trident sighted these ships off the entrance to Trondheim Fiord, and obtained a hit on the 8-inch cruiser and possiblyone on an escorting destroyer. The same morning torpedo aircraft from.M.S. Victorious carried out a sweep in their vicinity during a severe snow stormbut sighted nothing. Three aircraft failed to return to Victorious. The enemy ships were located in Aas Fiord (Trondheim) later in the day.Western Atlantic.3. The Free French Cruiser Submarine Surcouf (2,880 tons) was sunk in collision with the American Transport Thompson Lykes in the Panama canal zone after dark on the 18th.Mediterranean.4. The destroyer Sultan Hisar, built by Denny Brothers, was handed over tothe Turkish Government at Alexandretta on the 19th.An enemy convoy, believed to consist of six merchant ships escorted by abattleship, six cruisers and 15 destroyers, was sighted by aircraft 240 miles .N.W. of Benghazi on the morning of the 22nd. &apos; Air striking forces were despatched from Libya, but the majority of them were unable to locate the enemy,and no results of attacks made were observed.On the morning of the 23rd H.M. Submarine P. 34 attacked three merchant ships of about 9,000 tons escorted by seven destroyers off Tripoli (L) and estimatesthree possible hits.During the week some 17,000 tons of French shipping have passed Gibraltareastbound and 25,000 tons westbound, all under escort,Far East.5. &apos; In an enemy air attack on Darwin on the 19th the American DestroyerPeary (1,190 tons, built 1920) and six merchant ships were sunk, and two merchant ships were seriously damaged. H.M. Australian Sloop Swan, the hospital shipManunda, the depot ship Platypus and three auxiliary vessels were slightly damaged. The main jetty was so damaged that it cannot at present be used by ships.
On the 19th the enemy landed at Bali and the expedition was heavily attacked by air and sea. Aircraft attacked in the morning and claimed hits on one or more cruisers and two transports. In a night attack by American and dutch surface forces, one enemy cruiser was probably sunk and two cruisers andtwo destroyers were considerably damaged. Allied losses were one destroyer sunk and the Dutch Cruiser Tromp damaged. Aircraft again attacked on the 20thand claimed hits on three cruisers. On the following day aircraft sent to continuethe attack could find no ships in the vicinity.Air attacks were also made on a Japanese convoy north of Lombok on the night of 23rd/24th, when two ships were hit; and near Macassar on the 24th, when-two transports were sunk.An American submarine attacked a convoy north of Lombok on the 24thand claimed one transport certainly, and one probably sunk.II.M. River Gunboats Grasshopper and Dragonfly, the Tug St. Breock anda Fairmile type motor Launch were lost in the vicinity of Singapore about the14th. Casualties were heavy in Dragonfly, but almost all the crew and passengersof the other vessels were saved.During air raids on Tanjong Priok (Java) on 24th and 25th H.M.S. Exetersuffered slight damage, and some of the crew of H.M.A.S. Hobart were wounded.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. Surface craft attacked U-boats off Cape Wrath and west of Gibraltar.Aircraft made attacks north of Java, off Halifax and to the west of the Faroes,but in no attack has evidence of success been reported.No details of attacks in Western Atlantic waters have been received.Enemy Intelligence.German.7. The Gneisenau has been located in the floating dock at Kiel, the scharnhorst at Wilhelmshaven, while the Prinz Eugen is believed to be the 8-inch cruiser at Trondheim, The pocket battleship Lutzow is believed to be in theBaltic and the Admiral Scheer at Trondheim.U-Boats.8. Six U-boats are believed to have been operating in. the Caribbean Sea.and two to the westward of Trinidad. There has been an outburst of activity inthe Florida area which revealed the presence of two and possibly three U-boats.Activity further north on the American coast has declined, and only isolatedreports have come in from the area between New York and Newfoundland,Some U-boats have been working in the Rockall area, but no attacks on shipping have been reported.A German U-boat landed a hospital case at Fort de France, Martinique, on21st February. There is no other substantial evidence, however, of U-boats usingshore bases in this area.Vichy French.9. The battle cruiser Dunkerque has arrived at Toulon from Oran. It isthought that a considerable period in dockyard hands will be necessary beforeshe is ready for service.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.10. Nineteen ships, nine of them tankers, have been torpedoed in the WestAtlantic and West Indies, and of these only two ships are known to be still afloat.North of Australia six ships have been sunk and two damaged by air attack, andof these four were sunk and two damaged in the air attack on Port Darwin. one ship struck a mine off Noumea and was beached. In Home Waters on the east coast one ship was sunk by mine and another damaged by air attack. Two ships were sunk by aircraft off Libya.[23506] b   &apos;
Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During trie week ending the 25th February, 983 ships, including 241Allied and 31 neutral, were convoyed. One cruiser, 7 anti-aircraft ships, onearmed merchant cruiser, 59 destroyers (including 18 American destroyers) and117 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duty.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the21st February totalled 590,000 tons, compared with 1,015,000 tons during theprevious seven days, and an average of 716,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Ofthe week&apos;s total, 138,000 tons were oil of various grades. )During the month of January imports, other than mineral oil, were as       /follows : Ministry of Food. 1,027,100 tons, Ministry of Supply, 900,400 tons,Board of Trade 65,000 tons.   Total 2,052,500 tonsBritish Minelaying.12. During the week mines have been laid by surface craft in the Bay of biscay area and off the Flanders coast, and by aircraft, in the Heligoland Bight.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. There has been no minelaying by enemy aircraft, but E-boats arethought to have laid mines off the East Anglian coast, in which area nine mines have since been destroyed. Minelaying by E-boats was also suspected betweenDover and Dungeness, where three mines have been destroyed.Twenty magnetic and two acoustic mines have been destroyed during theweek, and the mine totals now are : magnetic 1,828, acoustic 1,235, contact 1,097.Mediterranean.14. /Aircraft reported that the enemy were laying mines off Suda Bay(Crete) on the 22nd.German and Italian Merchant Shipping.15. The ex-Dutch Schuyt Henk (147 tons) arrived at Ferrol on the15th February in ballast and after loading rubber from the German s.s. ElsaEssberger (6,103 tons) sailed on the evening of the 18th February, probablyfor a port in Occupied France. The Henk returned, reloaded and sailed on the22nd February. Another ex-Dutch coaster, the Thriantha (275 tons), has alsobeen loading from the Elsa Essberger, and was expected to sail on the23rd February.In addition to an attempt to run the blockade with Axis ships from the far east to Europe, plans are apparently being made to send Axis ships from europe to the Far East. The Japanese require various cargoes, such as machinery for steel rolling mills, presses for steel works and plant for coke ovens, besides certainprecision instruments.The laden German tanker Charlotte Schlieman (7,747 tons) sailed from LasPalmas on the night 23rd-24th February. She had been in the Canary Islandssince September 1939.Vichy Merchant Shipping.16.   Supplies for Axis forces in Libya continue to be sent through Vichyports.  On 27th January the s.s. Rabelais (4,999 tons) sailed from Marseilles forSfax with a cargo of trucks, and the s.s. Ste. Colette (1,925 tons, ex-NorwegianKarl) arrived at Tunis on 11th February with Fiat trucks.   The s.s. Kroumir     \(1,881 tons) left Marseilles on 13th February for Tunis with French munitions       Iand 2,500 Italian cases marked &quot; fragile,&quot; the contents of which were unknown.Vichy is reported to have agreed to German demands that 120,000 tons ofAllied1 shipping lying in French ports should be requisitioned and used for trans-porting these supplies; the ships would sail under the French flag. There arethirty-two British and Allied ships in the Mediterranean, of which eleven arealready carrying Axis cargoes and twenty-one are laid up. Two Dutch ships are reported to have left Marseilles on 28th January under the German flag and with german crews for an unknown destination.
Vichy authorities are requisitioning oil from ships interned in their ports.The naval tanker,. .Elhom arrived! at Diego Suarez about 27th Januarywith 500 tons of oil from Djibouti. It is expected that shei will make a similarvoyage in the near future.      &apos;&apos; :, &apos;iV &quot;        .   &apos;. ,.military SITUATION.(An outline map ,showing operations in Russia is included - in .tj*js&apos; Resume..as an inset.) . , .. &apos;Russo-German Campaign.Leningrad Sector. .      . .,,Ir,,,,,1.K17. Heavy Russian attacks designed to relieve Leningrad have been held up owing to the strength of the German defensive system which has been built up around the city and along the River Volkhov. .;:Central Sector.18. The Russians have made no further progress towards the Leningrad-Orshaw railway and little in the area west of Moscow. Heavy lighting is reported at Kholm and Velizh. Near Vyasma the Germans claim to have driven back theRussian advanced elements, capturing some prisoners and booty. The Russiancommunique of the 23rd February, however, claims that Russian forces havereached Dorogobuzh. It is not clear whether these Russian forces came fromthe north or from the east, but the former would appear more probable.Ukraine.19. The Russians have driven a wedge into the German positions in thearea south-east of Kharkov and are approaching Chuguyev. On the other hand,the German counter-offensive against the Donets Salient has met with some success&apos;, despite fierce Russian resistance, and they have reached Losovaya fromthe south-west. Russian attacks southwards from Barvenkova; have been repulsed. .Crimea. - :;* &apos; ;-h.; :f20. The Russians are continuing to reinforce their troops in the KerchPeninsula and in Sevastopol.Conclusions. &apos;21. During the past week, despite heavy fighting in many sectors, therehas been virtually no change except in the Ukraine, where the Germans have reduced the extent of the Donets Salient. This success is partially offset by theRussian advance towards Kharkov. The severe weather conditions continue to hamper operations on both sides considerably.Libya.22. During the 21st and the 22nd February enemy activity in the forward area; showed&apos; increased resistance to bur patrols. In addition, a considerablesouthward movement of M.T. and tanks - from -the Martuba area towardsTmimi was observed; The latest reports,&apos; however, indicate that this move1 was&apos;1not continuing beyond Tmimi during the 23rd; Patrols were active on both sidesin the area south of Tmimi On the 23rd and during the following night.; Thisactivity continued on the 25th, when seven columns were engaged in patroloperations on our front.    - ;, - -      1 &apos;.   11 . ,.      ^ &apos;\ 23. A Free French column has been operating with our forces in the areasouth and south-east of Mekili. &apos; . &apos; u     . , , &quot; ..   &apos;..[23506] Sb^ih^    / .; - ^X&amp;0:3&amp;
Intelligence.Far East.31. The figure of 29 Japanese divisions in the general area of the SouthChina Seas and the Pacific Islands remain unchanged.Burma.32. Japanese forces operating in Burma have probably been reinforced byone division from Thailand, thus bringing the total Japanese forces up to two divisions. In support of these operations, the Japanese have immediately available two divisions in Thailand and two divisions in Indo-China. Inaddition, one to two divisions could be made available from Malaya if required.Burma.24. After severe close fighting on the line of the Bilin River, we have with-drawn across the River Sittang. The withdrawal across the Sittang was strongly opposed and the railway bridge was demolished on the 23rd February. Someof our forces have been left on the east bank with little hope of their beingextricated. Our forces on the line of the Sittang have now been reorganised andreinforcements which have reached Burma during the last week include an armoured brigade and a British battalion.25. The evacuation of civilians from Rangoon has begun. The railway hasalmost ceased to function and the shortage of labour in the town makes it verydifficult to handle unloading of ships and movement of personnel. Rear ArmyHeadquarters have moved to Maymyo; Advance Headquarters remains atRangoon.Burma has come under the operational and administrative control ofOommander-in-Chief, India.Sumatra.26. Allied forces have now evacuated the whole of the South of Sumatra.At present the Japanese forces appear to be moving cautiously southward towardsOosthaven. One of the refineries at Blabjoe near Palembang, which owing to enemy action was not denied completely, has been bombed with satisfactory results.About 550 all ranks have escaped from Singapore to Sumatra.Java.27. ,&apos;The total strength of Imperial Forces in Java is 6,263 British and2,920 Australian.&apos; Bali.28. Japanese forces estimated at one regiment landed near Denpasar on the19th February and captured Denpasar aerodrome. It is not known how muchof the remainder of the island they hold.Timor.29. An enemy force landed from six transports on the south coast of. Timor,in the neighbourhood of Koepang. They also landed at Dilli, in PortugueseTimor.   No further information is available as to the course of the fighting.Philippines.30. The Japanese are reported to have reinforced their land and air forces.In the Bataan Peninsula there has been reduced activity during the last week.The enemy have carried out heavy shelling of United States fortified islands inthe mouth of Manila Bay.
Netherlands East Indies.33. Japanese forces in Sumatra have been reinforced by one division, andtheir estimated strength in this area is now two divisions. There are also believed to be two divisions in transports, one in the Flores Sea and one in the South ChinaSea area.AIR SITUATION.General Review.34. Attacks were made on Kiel and Wilhelmshaven where the battle cruisers have been located, and extensive sea mining was carried out in the heligoland Bight.Enemy attacks on.Malta were on a heavy scale.In Burma, Allied fighters inflicted heavy casualties in combats with japanese aircraft, with only slight loss to themselves. A. number of pur aircraft were destroyed during enemy attacks on our aerodromes in Java and Burma.Australia sustained her first air raid, two heavy attacks being made onDarwin. fUnited Kingdom.35.   Fighter Command flew 1,638 sorties by day and 282 sorties by night.36. Enemy activity against this country was on a very small scale. A Ju. 88was damaged by fighters over Liverpool Bay and night fighters destroyed aDornier 217 off Cromer.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.37. No major operations were undertaken. During 28 sorties despatchedby Fighter Command, individual attacks.were successfully carried out againstalcohol distilleries, a factory and railway targets in Northern France.Night.38. Bomber Command despatched a total of 202 sorties against targets inGermany and released 198 tons of H.E. bombs. In addition, 17 sorties were,devoted to the dropping of propaganda leaflets, and others to the laying of sea-mines, as recorded under &quot;Coastal Operations.&quot; i)39. Forty-six tons of H.E. bombs were dropped during an attack onWilhelmshaven floating dock and adjacent areas. Two 4,000-lb. bombs were seen to burst on the torpedo boat harbour and other bombs fell in the town butin general results were unobserved owing to cloud. Fifty-eight tons of bombs were released on similar targets at Kiel; large fires in the Naval dockyards were&apos;reported, and it is believed that these included an oil stores in the DeutscheWerke Shipyards.40. On two nights a total of 50 bombers operated on roving commissions overNorth-West Germany. In addition aerodromes in Norway were attacked by a!total of 15 aircraft and bursts were seen on the runways at Lista andKristiansund.Coastal Operations.fi 41. Coastal Command flew 215 patrols (404 sorties) and despatched 40additional sorties on convoy escorts. Shipping protection patrols by fighter command involved 1,218 sorties. A further 14 anti-shipping sorties were flown by our fighters, a number of enemy vessels being damaged by machine-gun andcannon fire.42. Bomber Command despatched a total of 102 aircraft to lay sea-mines in the Heligoland Bight. , ^43. Enemy aircraft operated against our shipping off Cromer at dusk bpthe 19th and 24th.  No minelaying by- hostile aircraft has been reported.[23506] c 2
Mediterranean.Libya.44. Our fighters maintained covering patrols over the forward area and alsoflew patrols in protection of shipping. Weather conditions during the weekwere generally unfavourable and air activity was correspondingly reduced.45. Patrols of Me. 109&apos;s were engaged by Kittyhawks over Martuba and near El Adem and two enemy fighters were destroyed and two damaged. FiveKittyhawks were forced down but four pilots were saved. Enemy reconnaissance aircraft were shot down over Gambut and Alexandria and another was probably destroyed by Beaufighters near Mersa Matruh.46. At night attacks were made on the landing grounds at Martuba and. Derna by a total of 32 Wellingtons. A number of fires i\esulted and a violentexplosion was seen on the road north of Martuba. Benghazi was bombed byten aircraft as a diversion to a successful sea-mining operation in the Harbour.Wellingtons from Malta attacked Tripoli (L) on three occasions.47. Enemy fighters were fairly active, and were employed to some extent asfighter-bombers. They carried out both high-level and div^bombing as well asmachine-gun attacks on our forward aerodromes.El Gazala and Acroma were raided and seven Hurricanes damaged onthe ground. Four long-range Me. 109&apos;s also attacked Maktila landing ground(16 miles E.S.E. of Sidi Barrani) and destroyed or damaged five of our aircraft on the ground and shot down a Blenheim.48. Ju. 87&apos;s escorted by fighters made two attacks on Tobruk but causedno damage of importance. On the 22nd a convoy off Sidi Barrani was attacked and Hurricanes on patrol shot down one Ju. 88 and probably destroyed and damaged (two others.Malta. .49. Enemy attacks against our aerodromes were resumed, and were on an intensive scale from the 21st to the 23rd. At night, continuous intruder patrols were maintained. It is probable that these raids were intended to keep our aircraft grounded during the passage of an important convoy to Tripoli, referredto in the Naval Section. Considerable damage was caused at Luqa, Hal Far andTakali and the aerodromes were badly cratered. On the ground, nine aircraft were destroyed and nineteen were damaged.Three of the raiders were shot down, three probably destroyed and fourdamaged, for the loss of two Hurricanes.Sea Communications.50. One Albacore attacked a tanker of 4,000 tons 25 miles west of Tripoli(L), making a hit which was followed by a large flash.Russia.German Air Force.51. There are indications that G.A.F. strength on the Russian Front hasbeen increased since 1st January by more than 200 operational aircraft, following-re-equipment in Germany. This increase is to be due to the strongRussian pressure which has been maintained both on the Smolensk and on thesouthern fronts.Burma.52. In addition to maintaining defensive fighter patrols over Rangoon, air support was provided for our troops in the Sittang area. On one occasion a continuous attack by every available aircraft was sustained for several hours ona column of over 500 vehicles. Many fires were started, particularly among largeconcentrations of troops and transport in Kyaikto, and the village itself was seton fire.  Later sorties found troops and transport much dispersed.
53. Enemy aircraft raided Mandalay, Bassein, Maymyo, Toungoo andPyinmana.54. On the 21st, five aircraft of the American Volunteer Group intercepteda hostile force of 52 aircraft in the Sittang area, destroying three andprobably destroying three more, without loss to themselves.55. Twenty-eight Japanese fighters approached Mingaladon on the 25thand four were shot down by the American Volunteer Group. Later in the day,the aerodrome was attacked by 56 aircraft, five of our bombers being destroyed and five damaged on the ground. American fighters again intercepted and are reported to have destroyed 19 enemy aircraft and probably seven more.Hurricanes destroyed a further six.In these combats our losses were one American P. 40 (Tomahawk) andone Hurricane, the pilot of the former being safe.Netherlands East Indies.56. The aerodrome at Den Pasar on Bali Island, which the enemy had brought into operational use soon after they had landed on the island on the 19th,was bombed on the night 20th/21st and following days. Six bombers on theground were probably destroyed and the runway damaged. Our aircraft also attacked Palembang, where further enemy aircraft were destroyed, and carriedout attacks on shipping in the river.57. Japanese aircraft attacked Sourabaya and our aerodromes at Semblak(Buitenzorg), Andir (Bandoeng), Malang and Kalidjati. destroying a total of26 aircraft on the ground and damaging others. A number of these raids were intercepted. Our fighters destroyed five enemy aircraft, and A.A. fire accountedfor nine more.   We lost 12 aircraft.Australia.58. Australia^ first air raids took place on the 19th, when two heavy attacks were made on Darwin. In the first attack, the harbour and shipping was attacked by fifty-seven aircraft. In the second, forty-eight heavy bombers bombedservice installations and considerable&apos; damage was done to property, includingservice buildings. Nine aircraft were destroyed on the ground and eight of our fighters were lost in combat. Five enemy aircraft were destroyed and five more probably destroyed.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.59. Except for one minor daylight incident at Skegness on the 21st, whenbombs on Admiralty property north of the town caused a few service casualties,there has been nothing to record.Casualties.60. Estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hoursWednesday, the 25th February, are 8 killed; these occurred in the incident at great Yarmouth on the 18th February which was reported in last week&apos;s Resume.
