draft Declaration.His Majesty&apos;s Government, having considered the anxieties expressed in thiscountry and in India as to the fulfilment of the promises made in regard to thefuture of India, have decided to lay down in precise and clear terms the steps which they propose shall be taken for the earliest possible realisation of self-government in India. The object is the creation of a new Indian Union whichshall constitute a Dominion, associated with the United Kingdom and the otherDominions by a common allegiance to the Crown, but equal to them in every respect, in no way subordinate in any aspect of its domestic or external affairs.His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore make the following declaration : (a) Immediately upon the cessation of hostilities, steps shall be taken to setup in India, in the manner described hereafter, an elected bodycharged with the task of framing a new Constitution for India.(b) Provision shall be made, as set out below, for the participation of theIndian States in the Constitution-making body.(c) His Majesty&apos;s Government undertake to accept and implement forth with the Constitution so framed subject only to :  (i) the right of any Province of British India that is not preparedto accept the new Constitution to retain its present consti-tutional position, provision being made for its subsequentaccession if it so decides.With such non-acceding Provinces, should they so desire, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will be prepared to agree upon new constitutional arrangements on lines analogous to those here laid down.(ii) the signing of a Treaty which shall be negotiated between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the constitution-making body. this treaty will cover all necessary matters arising out of thecomplete transfer of responsibility from British to Indianhands; it will make provision, in accordance with the undertakings given by His Majesty&apos;s Government, for the----- protection of racial and religious minorities; but will notimpose any restriction on the power of the Indian Union todecide in the future its relationship to the other Member Statesof the British Commonwealth.Whether or not an Indian State elects to adhere to the Constitution,it will be necessary to negotiate a revision of its Treaty arrangements,so far as this may be required in the new situation.(d) the constitution-making body shall be composed as follows, unless theleaders of Indian opinion in the principal communities agree uponsome other form before the end of hostilities : Immediately upon the result being known of the ProvincialElections which will be necessary at the end of hostilities, the entiremembership of the Lower Houses of the Provincial Legislaturesshall, as a single electoral college, proceed to the election ofthe constitution-making body by the system of proportional representation. This new body shall be in number about one-tenth of the number of the electoral college.Indian States shall be invited to appoint representatives in thesame proportion to their total population as in the case ofthe representatives of British India as a whole, and with the same powers as the British Indian members.(e) While during the critical period which now faces India, and until thenew Constitution can be framed, His Majesty&apos;s Government must inevitably bear the full responsibility for the defence of India, they desire and invite the immediate and effective participation of theleaders of the principal sections of the Indian people in the counselsof their country, of the Commonwealth and of the United Nations.Thus they will be enabled to give their active and constructive help inthe discharge of a task which is vital and essential for the futurefreedom of India.
