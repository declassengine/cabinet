TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.- St is requested that spaciai oare may be takan te- ynsuire the sacreoy of thly dooumantg DOCUMENT &apos;IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.W.P.(U2)77, -falso C.O.S. (14-2)98(FINAL) .12TH FEBRUARY, 19jfc2.C09Y NO3 fWAR CABINET.AIR TRANSPORTReport by Chiefs of Staff.The memorandum (W,P.(42)  50) circulated to the WarCabinet by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs suggeststhat the allocation of air passages is in the hands of -theAir Ministry.     This is a misleading picture of the existing machinery for allotting air passages, and the genesis andfunction of the Air Priorities- Board are apparently misunderstood.The present Priorities Board was set up   by the Chiefsof Staff in February,  1941, to allocate seats in transport aircraft.     This conclusion was subject to amendment afterdetailed examination by the Vice Chief of the Air Staff.It was subsequently decided that the Board should decide on service priorities for the Middle East route only and that     ______relative Civil and Service priorities were -to- be. worked out between the representative of the Civil AviationDepartment and the Chairman of the Board (the Director of overseas Operations) at the Air Ministry, any difference ofopinion being referred by those two representatives to thePermanent Under Secretary and the Vice Chief of the AirStaff respectively, who would adjudlteete. 03? refers? it to-Ministerial arbitration if necessary.It was found in practice, however, that the relativemerits of Civil and Service priorities could best bedecided upon if all members of the.Board were present,  and this procedure has been adopted and proved to work verysatisfactorily.      Owing to the limited air transportresources available and ever-growing commitments it will never be possible to meet every reouirement from all theGovernment and Service Departments.During the period 10th October,  1941 to 17th February,1942, the accommodation given to Foreign Office applicantscompared with all other applications may be expressed in thefollowing percentages:-Foreign Office.    Services &amp; Other Departments,Allocated to anall-air route.Allocated sea andair passage viaWest AfricaNo facilitiesafforded82/o65$50%ofServi&apos;not in itself appear unreasonable.       It does,  in fact,show that the Priorities Board has not taken a one-sided view.

When the sei^e  .nd s-vope of the fighting services overseasare considered, and especially in the light of the new situation in the Far East, it appears inevitable that theirvery immediate requirements must on coeaslon toe regarded as having over-riding priority.      It must also he observedthat the rank %*/wou-ld-be passengers bears no relationship to the importance of their contribution to the immediatewar effort.     Two illustrations of this have recentlyoccurred when&apos; it was vital to afford absolute priority to the transport of twenty dockyard workmen to Alexandriaand tank spares to the Middle East.     As regards the womenpassengers, no passage has been given by the Board toany actress and it is assumed that this criticism refers to actresses who have been conveyed between this countryand America on the United Kingdom-Lisbon service which is not covered by the Board-.     These passengerswere taken in one instance on the representation of aGovernment Department;    in the second instance sparepayload happened to be available for allotment to afare-paying passenger through a last moment cancellation -on that service.It would be quite impracticable to adjudicatehere in England on the relative merits or demerits of priority passengers coming into this country.     alterations of loading in aircraft due to weather and other last minuteconsiderations at the initial point of departure or atsome stopping,places en route are inevitable.      The time factor alone would not permit of reference .to Londoneven though the Board should sit daily. &apos; -The proposal that a new Board should be set upcomposed of independent persons of standing with aPermanent Civil Service Secretariat would prove impracticable.-     Last moment alterations in dates of departure, amounts of payload due to weather and other conditions,  and cancellations of passages alreadyallotted demand that the secretarial side of airpriority allotment must be inside the Air Ministry.To refer such last minute changes to an outside secretariatwould on the score of time alone,  defeat its own object.Moreover the priorities must be judged on the relative importance of each applicant to the immediate prosecution of the war.     Unless, therefore, the Chiefs of Staffthemselves could spare the time to sit on the Board,no better.composition could be evolved than the present,namely a senior member of the Operations Directorate ineach Service Ministry together with the representativeof the D.G.C-.A.  who is in close and direct touch with allcivil departments of the Governments     It is clearlyimpracticable for all interested departments to berepresented on the BoardoThe proposal that this new Board should also dealwith applications for the provision, of special aircraft for air transport purposes is certainly impracticable andin any event wou.1 a result in adding one&apos;furtherlink to the chain,,      The allotment of service aircraft

can only be made at the expense of service needs and these can only be appreciated by and properly decided upon bythe Chiefs of Staff and the Defence Committee.      This isthe present procedure.      Similarly applications for thedeflection of civil aircraft from recognised routes wouldhave to be passed on by the proposed Board to the Secretaryof State for Air who is responsible for these matters.The Chiefs of Staff consider that the existing machinery is adequate and suitable to control the allocation of seats and loads in transport aircraft and they recommendthat it remains unaltered.(Signed)    DUDLEY POUND.C.
