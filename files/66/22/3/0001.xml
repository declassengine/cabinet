Printed for the War Cabinet.  February 1942.SECRET. Copy No.   gjW.P. (42) 73.February 10, 1942. &apos;WAR CABINET.STEEL SUPPLIES FOR TURKEY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ONE of the outstanding industrial achievements of recent years has been theerection of a vast modern steel works at Karabuk in Turkey. These works were designed, constructed and equipped throughout by British engineering firms.British engineers and steel works personnel have been working side by side withTurkish personnel, and the management of the works is under British influence and to some extent under British control.2. The political interest we have in maintaining and increasing theproduction of these works is therefore very great, more especially as they are regarded by the Turks themselves as the symbol of the modern Turkish Statefounded by Ataturk. It has become clear from reports made by Major-General Witham, the Ministry of Supply expert in Turkey, that the continuation of our position at Karabuk depends entirely on our ability to help. If we areunable to do this then the Turks will turn elsewhere, and this means Germany.Though a vast amount of equipment has been installed, factory roads laid out,blast-furnaces, coke ovens, steel furnaces and rolling mills erected, much still remains to be done, lie., installation of water and power supply and by-productplants, provision of spare parts, &amp;c, the supply of all which present veryconsiderable difficulties.3. There are, however, in addition to political reasons, weighty supply and strategic reasons why a very special effort should be made to help the Turks over these Steel Works. Karabuk is the only iron works of any considerable size inthe Middle East, and should, if operated efficiently and properly equipped, beable to supply a vast proportion of Turkey&apos;s steel requirements. Turkey herselfobtains a plentiful supply of iron from Devriki, but, owing to absence of facilitiesfor using this iron, Turkey is at present a large importer of steel which we, inaccordance with the spirit of the Anglo-Turkish alliance, have to supply ourselvesat great sacrifice, both from the shipping and supply points of view. There is,therefore, every advantage to ourselves in increasing production at Karabuk, andit is even possible that if production is stepped up we may be able to obtainsupplies of certain types of steel for the Middle East from Turkey, instead of having to tie up shipping in long voyages from this country or the United States.4. General Witham has reported that though these works are not properlyspeaking a military factory, they are, however, vital to Turkish armamentproduction. The Turkish military factories are well equipped, and are the solesource of supply for much of Turkey&apos;s ammunition and war material, since herguns and other equipment are largely of the continental type and cannot be fedfrom either this country or the United States. If we have to come to theassistance of Turkey in the event of a German invasion, our assistance willprobably be confined in the main to the despatch of such specialised formationsas aircraft squadrons. These will be dependent on the Turkish infantry divisions11633   [23456]
who must be properly equipped for their task, and this they can only be if theyare certain of proper supplies for their military factories, which in turn dependsto a great extent on production at Karabuk.5. Our policy of supplying Turkey with her essential requirements is an integral part of our whole Turkish policy, which is to maintain Turkey as aneconomic and military barrier against German penetration into the Middle East.This policy was not meant to involve the indiscriminate supply of everythingasked for by the Turks. Every request has been, and is, carefully scrutinised inthe light of (a) the supply and shipping position, and of (&amp;) its essential needfor tJhe maintenance of our own and. the Turkish war effort and of civilian life in Turkey. It would be unjustifiable to facilitate all the orders which the turkish authorities might wish to place in this country to make the Karabuk Works intoa model steel works. But I understand that certain improvements are vitally necessary and these are estimated to involve only some 1,000 tons of steel, the major portion of which could be taken from the Board of Trade export allocation.In view of the strategic, economic and political importance of Karabuk, I recentlyproposed to the Allied Supplies Executive that the following action shouldbe taken : (a) Requirements for Karabuk should be treated as requests for war materialby the Turkish Government and given the same priority.(&amp;) In order that the material supplied should be used to the best advantage,instructions should be sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Angorato urge the Turks to take immediate action on the recommendations made to them by General Witham and their British consulting engineers.(c) The Ministry of Supply should be entrusted with the task of supervising.*the placing of such orders as were judged essential, that departmentbeing considered the most appropriate to advise on that point, and atthe same time represent our own supply interests.6. The Chairman of the Allied Supplies Executive felt unable to accept theseproposals. In view, however, of the importance which I attach to the matter, Irequest the approval of the War Cabinet of my recommendations.A. E.Foreign Office, February 10, 1942.
