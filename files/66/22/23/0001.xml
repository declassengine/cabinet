(42) 122!February 19, 1942TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 129)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 February 12th, to0700 February 19th,1942[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room
Mediterranean.4. During the passage of two convoys escorted by H.M. Ships, one from alexandria to Malta and the other from Malta to Alexandria, repeated attacks were made by enemy aircraft.The westbound convoy was twice attacked off Libya on the 13th and thes.s. Clan Campbell (7,798 tons) was damaged and had to be escorted to Tobruk,whence she later safely arrived at Alexandria. On the following day, the convoys met and, during the exchange of escorts, all were in action against air-craft. The main attacks were directed against the westbound convoy, which wasthen 250 miles east of Malta. The two remaining ships, the S-S., Rowallqn Castle(7,798 tons) and Clan Chattan (7,260 tons), were severely damaged and had later to be sunk by our forces.General Review.1. The Scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugen succeeded in reachingGermany although heavily attacked and probably damaged by air and naval forcesin the Channel and southern North Sea.Convoys to and from Malta were heavily attacked by aircraft in the central mediterranean. An Italian naval force, which failed to intercept them, sufferedseveral casualties from our air and submarine attack.Shipping was heavily bombed in the Singapore area prior to the fall of theCity on the 15th, and there has been a heavy U-boat attack on tankers in theDutch West Indies.   Shipping casualties elsewhere have not been heavy.Home Waters.2. At 1042 on the 12th, Spitfires on reconnaissance sighted two large ships off Le Touquet steering a northerly course at high speed. These subsequentlyproved to be the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, in company with the Prinz Eugenand a number of destroyers, E-Boats and small craft, under strong air protection.At 1230 eight M.T.Bs. from Dover and Ramsgate carried out an attack, inwhich one torpedo hit is claimed on the Prinz Eugen. At 1300 a torpedo attack was made by six Naval Swordfish, escorted by five squadrons of fighters. none of the Swordfish returned, but all released their torpedoes and their fighter escortsestimated that they obtained a hit on a battle-cruiser.At 1545, when about 20 miles west of the Hook of Holland, H.M. DestroyersCampbell, Vivacious and Worcester, which had proceeded across the mine barrier,attacked the battle-cruisers at 2,500-3,500 yards range and claimed one probableand two possible hits with torpedoes. H.M.S. Worcester was set on fire butsucceeded in reaching port under her own steam. At about the same time,H.M. Destroyers Mackay and WHITSHED attacked a single ship, probably thePrinz Eugen.Starting at 1240 a total of 243 bombers and 41 Coastal Command aircraft,of which 27 were torpedo-carrying Beauforts, with a further 338 fighters and18 Hurricane bombers, was despatched in the course of the afternoon. Owingto poor visibility and low cloud, which was at times down to 500 feet, only 34 ofthe bombers and 14 Beauforts were able to attack. No definite hits were claimedon the ships although a Beaufort may possibly have obtained a torpedo hit.Combats with the fighter cover resulted in 17 enemy aircraft being destroyed,5 probably destroyed and 17 damaged. Our losses were 15 bombers, 5 coastal command aircraft and 17 fighters missing.3. A force of M.T.Bs. and M.G.Bs. was despatched during the night of the15th/16th to intercept a vessel, probably a barrage-breaker with four escorts,steering to the N.E. off Calais. An attack was made but, owing to difficult seaconditions and heavy enemy fire, no hits were claimed.It is estimated that upwards of 4,400 tons of enemy merchant shipping havebeen sunk or seriously damaged by our aircraft. Details are given in the air situation.
There was no damage to the ships of the eastbound convoy, although H.M.S.Carlisle was temporarily disabled by near misses. No casualties to personnelhave been reported from any ship.Five enemy aircraft were certainly, and four others probably destroyed : themajority of them by the air escort.During the night of the 15th/16th, an enemy force of at least two eight-inchand two six-inch cruisers, with nine destroyers, which had apparently attempted to intercept the convoys, was attacked by Naval Albacores 85 miles east of CapePassaro, Sicily. The aircraft claimed torpedo hits on two cruisers and a destroyer. One of the cruisers was seen to be on fire and losing speed. On the. following afternoon H.M. Submarine P. 36 attacked two eight-inch cruisersentering the Straits of Messina from the eastward and claimed two hits with torpedoes on one cruiser.5. H.M. Submarine Thunderbolt, on the 1st, topedoed and sank a ship of5,000 tons bound to the south-east in convoy north of Cephalonia. On the 3rd,she torpedoed and probably sank a 750 ton U-boat south-west of Crete, and, onthe 6th, damaged an armed trawler by gunfire south of Corfu, under the fire ofshore batteries.H.M. Submarine P. 35 torpedoed, on the 3rd, a 6,600-ton merchant shipanchored off Mahedia, Tunisia..   The ship was later seen to have been beached.H.M. Submarine Upholder, on the 8th, torpedoed and sank a 2,500-ton dieselship bound eastward in ballast.In an air attack on Malta on the 13th, H.M.S. Talbot (submarine depot ship),received considerable damage through two direct hits.Some 4,000 tons of enemy merchant shipping have been seriously damaged by our aircraft.During the week upwards of 19,300 tons of French shipping eastbound, and33,900 tons westbound have passed the Straits of Gibraltar under escort. &apos;Far East.6. Prior to the fall of Singapore on the 15th, heavy bombing attacks weremade on shipping on the Singapore-Batavia route. H.M. Cruiser Durban, whileproceeding to Singapore to assist in evacuation, was bombed on the 11th and12th and returned to Batavia considerably damaged. Two of ELM. auxiliaryvessels were sunk and a third damaged during evacuation on the 14th; and400 survivors, including women and children, reached the shore on the LinggaArchipelago (Singapore Approaches). No details of merchant shipping lossesduring the evacuation have been received.The Dutch Destroyer Van Ghent struck a reef in the Gaspar Strait (southof Banka) on the 15th and has been abandoned.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. In addition to the U-boat torpedoed by H.M.S. Thunderbolt, there havebeen three promising attacks by aircraft in the North Atlantic and a U-boat isreported to have been probably destroyed west of Curacao. In all, ten attacks have been made by aircraft: four in the North Atlantic, four off Libya, one offTrincomalee and one in.the West Indies. Attacks by surface craft included one by a Canadian corvette off Newfoundland and another by an American cutteroff Cape Hatteras,Enemy Intelligence.German.8. Due to weather conditions there has been no adequate air reconnaissance of the German North Sea ports recently and the Schdrnhorst, Gneisenau andPrinz Eugen are as yet unlocated. It is considered that some, or all, of these ships were damaged on the 12th and that they will be unfit for full operationaluse for two or three months.[23486] b 2
Italian.9. The enemy operations in the Central Mediterranean on the 15th and 16thare believed to have been carried out by two forces, one from Messina and theother from Taranto.U-Boats.10. U-boat activity appears to be more widely dispersed than of late. Atleast three U-boats are thought to have carried out the attack on Aruba andothers are believed to be on passage to the Caribbean. There has been areduction in the number operating off the North American Coast, although thereare still several to the southward of Newfoundland. Two or three have beenreported in the Iceland (C) area. One or two U-boats may be in the neighbour-hood of Freetown and the Cape Verde Islands. In the Mediterranean, there hasbeen activity between Tobruk and Alexandria and possibly still farther to the eastward.Japanese.11. The main fleet appears to be in the western Mandated Islands area.A new 16-inch battleship, the Kii, has now joined the fleet. The aircraft carriershave been replenishing with aircraft in Japan. The 8-inch cruisers Kako andFurutaka have been transferred to the Southern Fleet to replace casualties.The Southern Fleet is widely dispersed and operating south of Malaya, inthe Macassar Straits, the Flores Sea and in the Philippines.vichy Intelligence.12. The French Submarines La Sibylle, Amazone, Antiope and Amphitrite,escorted by the French Patrol Vessel La Bonoise passed Gibraltar westbound onthe 14th.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.13. In an attack by several U-boats at Aruba, in the Caribbean Sea, threetankers were torpedoed : one being sunk. Four tankers, of which two wereVenezuelan, were torpedoed and sunk while on passage to Aruba. In ten otherU-boat attacks two ships were sunk off the North American coast, one offTrincomalee and two in the Netherlands East Indies; the other five ships are believed to be still afloat.Aircraft are known to have sunk three ships in the Netherlands East Indies.One ship was damaged by bombing off the Tees.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. During the week ending the 18th February, 902 ships, including 224Allied and 24 neutral, were convoyed. Two anti-aircraft ships, 6 armed merchant cruisers and ocean boarding vessels, 74 destroyers (including 20 Americandestroyers) and 86 sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the weekending the 14th February totalled 1,015,000 tons, compared with an average of761,000 tons during the past ten weeks.  Oil imports totalled 506,000 tons.During the month of December 1941, imports other than those in tankerswere as follows: Ministry of Food, 1,395,800 tons, Ministry of Supply,1,279,000 tons, Board of Trade, 86,200 tons.  Total 2,761,000 tons.British Minelaying.15. Mines have been laid by surface craft during the week in the Biscayarea, off the Flanders Coast and in the Faroes-Iceland (C) area. Aircraft laidmines in the North Sea and, to a lesser extent, in the Mediterranean.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.16. Minelaying by enemy aircraft took place on three nights of the weekoff the East Coast between the Thames Estuary and the Tyne.
MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.Leningrad Sector. .19.   The fighting around Leningrad has been very severe.Central Sector.20. Although there has been heavy fighting, there is no exact information regarding Russian progress in the pincer movement west of Moscow. The press reports of considerable Russian advances are certainly exaggerated.Ukraine.21. In the Donets area the German counter-attacks mentioned last weekhave made little or no progress; this is partly due to the weather, including atemporary thaw announced in the German press.Crimea. .22. There are indications that the Russians are reinforcing Kerch andSevastopol.Conclusion.23. Although fighting has continued on many sectors of the front, no progress has been made by the Russians. This is probably due both to the german resistance and to the weather deep snow or thaw both producing extremelydifficult conditions in different parts of the front.Libya.24. On the morning of the 14th February enemy air activity over our forward troops was intensified, and in the afternoon three strong columns began to advance towards the position held by the 13th Corps which extends southwardfrom Gazala. The northern column, which included some 40 tanks, appeared tobe directed on Gazala: the central column, of about the same strength, advancedon a parallel course some 20 miles further south, while the southern column,containing approximately 28 tanks, moved south-eastwards from Mekili...The fighter aircraft covering the enemy&apos;s columns suffered very heavily atthe hands of the R.A.F., but the advance continued on the 15th February. Thenorthern column shelled our.forward positions.west of Gazala and the centralcolumn was engaged by mobile columns which had been despatched to attack it.Nineteen magnetic and one acoustic mines have been destroyed during theweek; all of them off the East Coast... The mine totals are : Magnetic 1,806, Acoustic 1,231 and Contact 1,068.Foreign Waters.17. Aircraft laid mines at Tobruk on one night of the week and onemagnetic mine has since been destroyed.Four Japanese moored mines of an unknown type have been washed ashoreat Timor.German and Italian Merchant Shipping.18. The German s.s. Bessel (1,878 tons) at Vigo has had one of her holdsconverted into an oil fuel tank with a capacity of 800-1,000 tons.The Italian Tanker Lucania (8,106 tons) reported that she had been torpedoed, 65 miles south of Taranto, on the 12th.The Italian s.s. Capo Pino (4,785 tons) at Istanbul is loading for Salonikaand Italy.The Italian Tanker Arcola (6,349 tons) and Taigete (4.672 tons) were preparing on the 13th to sail from Teneriffe.
On the morning of the 16th February, however, without having established contact with our main position, all three enemy columns turned about and withdrew totheir former concentration areas north-west of the line Mekili-Tmimi, followed up by our fighting patrols and mobile columns.25. For some days prior to the enemy&apos;s advance, General Rommel had beenConcentrating the bulk of his fighting troops in the Mekili-Tmimi-Martuba areacovered by a line of outposts extending southwards from the coast betweenTmimi and Gazala. In addition, his air forces had become increasingly active.Some form of offensive was therefore expected. It has been suggested thatGeneral Rommel may have undertaken the operation with one of the followingobjects : (a) To carry out a reconnaissance in force.(6) To launch a &quot; blitz &quot; attack aimed at breaking through to Tobruk.(c) To entice our armoured forces out of supporting range of the Gazalaposition and to attack them on ground favourable to him.His unexpected withdrawal before his columns had become heavily engagedis, however, difficult to explain. In any event, there seems little doubt that, what-ever his object may have been he failed to achieve it.26. Owing to the demolitions carried out prior to our withdrawal theenemy is still unable to use the port of Derna, while the R.A.F. are concentrating on interfering with his traffic through Benghazi. His administrative difficulties are, therefore, likely to be considerable.27.   The Western Desert railway has now been extended as far as Capuzzo.Far East.Burma:28. During the past week our forces have withdrawn to the line of the RiverBilin, with detachments on the Salween at Shwegun, Kamamaung and Papun.There has been heavy and confused fighting all along the Bilin line and a fewJapanese patrols succeeded in crossing the river.   The situation is in hand.A second Chinese division is believed to have entered Burma, and others are moving westward towards the frontier. It is stated that Japanese reinforce-ments are moving north in Thailand towards the Shan border.Malaya.29. Resistance ceased in Singapore at 2200 hours local time on the 15thFebruary.A number of evacuee ships were got away; several were sunk, but details arenot known. It is not thought that any military personnel, other than certainbase units and technical personnel required in the Netherlands East Indies andsome wounded, were evacuated.Netherlands East Indies.30.   The following reached Java on the 14th February : One Australian Machine-Gun Battalion.One Australian Pioneer Battalion.Advance parties of Australian Corps.They are being organised at present for aerodrome defence.31. The Japanese occupied Palembang and Djambi, in Sumatra, on the15th February. Landings from the sea were preceded, 24 hours earlier, byparachute attacks which seem to have been ineffective. The Allied air forces, nowwithdrawn to Java, inflicted considerable casualties on troops in landing craft and damage on warships and transports.The oil-denial scheme at Palembang is reported to have been completed and,in&apos; North Sumatra, the harbours at Belawan, Pangkalanbrandan and Sabang havealso been denied.32. The Dutch destroyer Van Ghent struck a reef and had to be abandonedoff Banka Island.
Philippines.33.   Luzon no change.The Japanese have occupied the Island of Masbate (South of Luzon).Intelligence.Libya.34.   Numerous reports have been received of Italian reinforcements in Libyaand it is likely that part at least of the 133rd Armoured Division has arrived atTripoli (L).Far East.35. It is believed that there are now 29 Japanese divisions in the generalarea of the South China Seas and the Pacific Islands. Of these, it is estimatedthat seven divisions are available for fresh operations and that a further twocould probably be spared from Malaya at a later date if required.There are indications of an imminent attack on Bali and Lombok.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. Air operations against the scharnhorst, Gneisenau and Prinz Eugenare reported under &quot;Naval Situation.&quot;Our night bombing offensive has continued, and a policy of harassing raidsby single aircraft roving over wide areas has been started.Air activity in Libya was again on a large scale, and our fighters inflictedheavy casualties on the enemy.Enemy attacks on Malta have continued, but extremely severe weatherprovided respite towards the end of the week.In the Far East we have been forced to withdraw to aerodromes in West.Java.United Kingdom.37. Fighter Command flew 3,017 sorties by day, which is an increase ofabout 1,300 on the number flown in the previous week. This increase is partly due to the large number of sorties flown on the 12th, when enemy naval forcesproceeded up the English Channel. Four hundred and two sorties were flown by night.38. Enemy activity against this country was again on a small scale andconsisted mainly of coastal operations. Only 18 aircraft crossed the coast by day and six by night. One enemy bomber was destroyed by our fighters and one byA.A. defences.Germany and Occupied Territory.Night.39. Bomber Command operated against land targets on five nights, but on each occasion heavy cloud was encountered over the target area. A total of 296sorties were flown and 287 tons of bombs were released.40.   The main weight of the attacks fell on Cologne and Mannheim, whilelighter scale raids were made against Havre and St. Nazaire.   Accurate assess -&apos;v    ment of the results was impossible owing to the weather, but fires were reported at Cologne and in the dock area at Havre.41. On two nights a total of 33 aircraft operated on roving commissionsover North-West Germany, 44 tons of bombs being dropped. Apart from burstsobserved at Aurich, Oldenburg, Bremen and Wilhelmshaven, no definite results are reported.42. Aircraft of Fighter Command bombed the aerodromes at Abbeville,Bretigny and Gilze Rijen.
Day.43. Fighter Command despatched 44 offensive sorties. Spitfires hit thetower buildings and storage tanks at Beaupte alcohol distillery, and two attacks were made on the distillery at Verton, where the alcohol containers were leftsmoking. Other targets attacked included factories, warehouses, rolling-stockand locomotives in Northern France.Coastal Operations.44. Coastal Command flew 486 sorties and 75 additional sorties on convoy escorts. Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 1,571sorties, and a further 595 sorties were flown in operations against enemy naval units and shipping.45. A number of successful attacks were made on enemy shipping. AHudson scored two hits on a 1,200-ton vessel anchored near Sogne Fjord. Theship was left listing and settling by the stern. Another Hudson also made twohits on a 2,300-ton merchant vessel off the Norwegian Coast, but no results were seen. In an attack by Beauforts on shipping off Le Verdon two small ships were sunk and a third was left down by the bows. A 10,000-ton camouflagedmerchant vessel in the Bay of Biscay was attacked with depth charges, but withindecisive results., 46. In addition to these operations fighters attacked a number of smallvessels, including two flakships and an E-boat, located off the Dutch, Belgian andFrench Coasts. Fighters on shipping protection patrols destroyed two enemy bombers and damaged a further two.47. On three nights Bomber Command despatched a total of 94 aircraft to lay sea mines off the Frisian Islands and off the coast of North-West Germany.48. Enemy activity was on a small scale. Approximately 90 aircraft were engaged in sea mining off the East Coast, and about 30 on anti-shipping operationsoff the East Coast and in the Western Approaches.Mediterranean.Libya.49. Throughout the week our fighters carried out a number of offensivesweeps over the battle area, maintained covering patrols over our forwardlanding grounds and troops, and provided protection for shipping off the coast of Cyrenaica. On the 14th, 18 Kittyhawks intercepted a force of about 30 enemy aircraft which were attacking our troops in the Acroma area. It is claimed that15 Italian and five German fighters were destroyed and that all the remainingaircraft were hit.   The Kittyhawks were not damaged.50. Blenheim bombers, operating in close support of our ground forces,made several hits on tanks and M.T. south-west of El Gazala.51. Wellingtons continued their attacks on Benghazi and laid mines in the approaches to the harbour. The quays and railway sidings were hit. Tripoli (L)was also bombed by Wellingtons, and fires were started in the harbour area. NavalSwordfish also laid mines outside the harbour.52. Enemy activity showed a marked increase during the week and continuous attacks were made on our landing grounds and troops in the forwardareas. At El Adem, four Hurricanes were damaged on the ground, and atTobruk a reservoir was hit, causing the loss of 500 tons of water.Malta.53. Enemy raids on the Island continued on an intensive scale, a total ofabout 430 aircraft taking part in the attacks.54. Most of the attacks were directed against the aerodromes. At Luqa,which was raided five times, several large craters were made on the runway; twoof our aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and nine were damaged. At Takaliand, Hal Far, buildings were seriously damaged and, later, the aerodromes wereflooded by the worst rainstorms experienced this winter.
&apos;   Other objectives included the Grand Harbour and the submarine base onwhich two hits were made causing casualties to service personnel.55. Our fighters were considerably hampered by the unserviceability of our aerodromes, but they shot down three enemy aircraft, while the A.A. defencesdestroyed five and possibly destroyed a further one.Sicily.56. The aerodromes at Catania, Comiso and Gerbini were bombed by wellingtons from Malta. Several fires were started which caused explosionsamong aircraft on the ground. At Catania bombs also fell close to the harbour,railway station and gasworks. The harbours at Augusta and Syracuse were alsoraided, explosions being seen at both.Greece and Crete.57. The submarine base at Salamis was attacked by a Liberator from Egypt.Bombs were seen to burst in the dockyard. Fifteen Wellingtons bombed the harbour and aerodrome at Heraklion, both of which-were hit.Sea Communications.58.   North-west of Tripoli (L) four Naval Albacores attacked a west-boundmerchant vessel of 4,000 tons, which was left stationary and listing.59.   Several reconnaissances of the Ionian Sea, of the Mediterranean betweenGreece and Libya, and of the Tunisian Coast were made by our aircraft.Russia.60.   There have been no important. changes in the air situation on theRussian Front. .. iThe Far East.Burma.61. Targets at Moulmein were attacked on six occasions by our light bombers. Fires were started in the town, and hits were made on the barrack area and on rolling-stock. . Other attacks were made on enemy stores on the Paan-Thaton road, on the Thaten railway station, where a water tower and the sidingswere hit, and on enemy troop positions in the River Bilin area.62. At Martaban, Lysanders scored hits on the railway track and jetties,and a warehouse was set on fire. The ferry at Duyinzeik (7 miles N.E. of Thaton)was bombed with good result.Netherlands East Indies.63. Allied air operations were mainly confined to attacks on enemy convoys and to harassing enemy landings. In the Sumatra area, one large transport was sunk, two cruisers and five transports were hit, and considerable destruction was caused amongst enemy barges and personnel. In the Macassar Straits, onevessel was probably hit. . . .64. Enemy attacks on the aerodrome and refinery at Palembang included the dropping of about 800 parachutists, most of whom were mopped up. later in the week, when the aerodromes at- Palembang had been occupied by the enemy,American Tomahawks attacked Palembang aerodrome. Bombs were dropped on enemy aircraft dispersed on the ground, and four enemy fighters were shot down in combat. . 1 - -65^.   On  the  15th,   our   aircraft  were  withdrawn   from   Sumatra  to west Java aerodromes.66.   About 30 enemy aircraft made an attack on Sourabaya and Malang..At the former, some damage was caused to Dutch Naval units, but at Malang the damage was negligible.  American Tomahawks intercepted the enemy and shot;down five bombers and one fighter for the loss of one Tomahawk.[23486] . c
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.69. Bombs were dropped during daylight in various coastal districts. Onthe 12th, in Dorset and Devonshire, where houses were damaged and there were a few casualties; on the 17th in Suffolk, where minor incidents occurred, and onthe 18th at Great Yarmouth, where some damage was caused and seven people were killed.During the night of the 15th/16th bombs or mines dropped in Northumberlandcaused some damage and a few casualties. i \Casualties.70. Estimated casualties for the week ending 0600 hours Wednesday, the18th February, are eight killed and twelve seriously injured.67. In an attack by nine enemy aircraft on Alor Island (Timor) considerable damage was done to Government buildings.Pacific Zone.68. Our aircraft attacked the aerodrome at Gasmata (New Britain Island)and scored! hits on the runway.
