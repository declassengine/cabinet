Printed for the War Cabinet. February 1942.SECBET Copy No.W.P. (42) 72.February 11, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE problem of civil air transport in wartime is to make the most efficient use of an inadequate and diminishing number of passenger-carrying aircraft with civil markings (so that they can land at neutral airports) to help the Service andother departments in the conduct of the war.The number of people who want to fly exceeds the available seating capacity.Those who allocate the seats must be familiar with the needs of aviation, the availability of aircraft, the maintenance situation, hour-to-hour changes in the weather, and a dozen other points. They must also have a great deal of know-ledge, much of it secret, about the needs of the different theatres of war and ofthe movements of the United States and other Allied Forces. Accordingly, inallocating seats in civil aircraft I am advised, except in regard to the Lisbonroute, by a Priorities Board, set up following a suggestion of the Chiefs of Staff,which consists of one representative of each of the Service Departments and amember of the Civil Aviation Department to represent the Civil Departments.The substitute proposed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for this board is an &quot; Independent Board,&quot; consisting of gentlemen with no directassociation with or responsibility within the Service Departments or the CivilAviation Department, and with a staff of its own. I fear that such a body would add an unnecessary complication to the machinery of government, duplicate work,reduce efficiency and waste time.Nor would it be a practicable arrangement, for the &apos;&apos; Independent Board &apos;&apos;would have to be available to give decisions at any hour of the day or night, tore-allocate places suddenly vacated, or. to make fresh arrangements necessitated by unexpected changes in the programme due, it may be, to engine failure, enemy action or a change in the weather.I am far from claiming that it is within the power of the present PrioritiesBoard to give satisfaction to all its customers. I am certain that an outside body which, before coming to any decision, would have to consult the Civil AviationDepartment and all the Service Departments would give less satisfaction.It is true that on the Lisbon service I have carried actresses for the Ministryof Information and, more questionably, a butler for the Foreign Office. There wasno question of any of them taking precedence over passengers travelling on important war business.I am responsible to Parliament for civil air transport. To divide this responsibility between me and another Minister responsible for a new board would invite criticism upon a point on which Parliament is rightly sensitive -divided responsibility. The unenviable task of weighing rival claims to the limited accommodation available in transport aircraft in time of war is one whicha Service Minister, and naturally, therefore, the Secretary of State for Air, must accept;A.
