Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 92.February 19, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE FAR EAST.Report of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on the termination, of his appointment as Resident Minister. ,A record of my brief tenure of office as Resident Cabinet Minister at singapore for Far Eastern Affairs may prove of interest and even df utility, ifthere are lessons to be drawn from it for future guidance.I received notice of my appointment on the morning of the 10th December;two days after the outbreak of war in the Pacific. I was, at the same time,authorised to set up a War Council. I at once informed the Governor of theStraits Settlements (Sir Shenton Thomas) and asked him to attend a preliminary meeting of the War Council that afternoon at 5.30-Early in the afterndon I drove to the Naval Base to inform the Commander-in-Chief, Far East. When I arrived there the news had just been received&apos;ofthe loss of H.M.S. Prince of Wales and HM.S. Repulse. In these unhappycircumstances the Commander-in-Chief found it impossible to attend the meetingI was arranging for the afternoon. He informed me that Vice-Admiral SirGeoffrey Layton, who had been about to leave that morning, had not actually sailedwhen the news arrived, and had thereupon returned to duty and was acting once more as Naval Cbmmander-in-Chief./Later in the afternoon I visited Major-General Gordon Bennett, OfficerCommanding A.LF. in Johore, and subsequently wrote to him explaining thiecomposition of the War Council, regretting that owing to his being stationed inJohore we could not expect him to attend, but assuring him that he would beinformed when any matters affecting the Australian forces were to be discussed,and his presence at the Council would be welcomed whenever he happened to bein Singapore.At 5.30 there was ah informal, preliminary meeting of the War Council;attended by the Governor, the General Officer Commanding (Lieut.-GeheraiPercival), the Air Officer Commanding (Air Vice-Marshal Pulford) and myself.At the meeting which took place on the following morning, the &quot;-11th1December, and which was attended by the Commander-in-Chief, Far East, ;AirChief-Marshal Sir R. Brooke-Popham, and the Commander-in-Chief, EasternFleet, Vice-Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton, in addition to those present at tneprevious meeting, considerable divergence of view was discovered as to the he^cllfor and the functions of a War Council. Many difficulties were raised and questions asked-sUch as, had the War Council executive power ? If so, werethe Service members and the Goveriibr.no longer responsible to the Chiefs ofStaff and the Colonial Office? Did the Chairman of the Council expect to bisconsulted on purely military questions? The General Officer Commanding ami!the Air Officer Commanding were serving under the Commahder-in-Chief; Far[23482] B
East, how then could they sit as equal members of the Council with their superiorofficer ? It was suggested that two meetings a week would be sufficient whenthe various authorities, military and civil, would report to the Council. doubt was also expressed as to the meaning of the Prime Minister&apos;s telegram, andfurther clarification was demanded. As I saw little hope of reaching agreementI undertook to draft a telegram asking for clarification, which I would submit tothe Council at the next meeting, and meanwhile passed on to other business.I accordingly drafted the following telegram, which I brought up at the next meeting : &quot; Some doubts exist in the minds of proposed members of War council as to scope of its activities. In my view, members, while retaining their ownresponsibilities towards their Service or Civil Chiefs and their own powersof decision, should bring before the Council all matters and proposals affect-ing the conduct of the war and they should! be freely discussed. A case in&apos; point would have been the decision of the Commander-in-Chief, Far Eastern-------Fleet, to take the Fleet out on the 9th December and the conditions in which that operation was conducted. Had the War Council been in existence atthe time, that proposal should, in my opinion, have been brought before it andthe opportunity given for views to be expressed. It would still have rested with the Commander-in-Chief to take the decision, having heard the viewsof his colleagues.&quot; Equally, decisions on matters of local government will rest with theGovernor, but he also should, when possible, consult his colleagues on theCouncil before taking important decisions.&quot;I said that I was willing, but reluctant, to send this telegram, as there wasno doubt on the matter in my own mind and I did not wish to occupy the time ofthe Prime Minister unnecessarily. The Commander-in-Chief, Far East, thensaid that he had himself telegraphed to the Chiefs of Staff asking for his positionto be defined and, pending the receipt of their reply, he thought no further action was necessary.No more was heard of the matter. The War Council continued to meet dailyuntil the termination of my appointment, and no question was raised again as toits powers or constitution.Two additional members were subsequently added to the Council, Sir GeorgeSansom as Director-General of Publicity, and Mr. Bowden as representative ofAustralia.It soon became apparent that too much of the War Council&apos;s time was spent in the discussion of matters relating to civil defence, which did not directlyconcern some of the officers present, especially the representatives of the navy and Air Force. I therefore suggested at the meeting on the 15th December thatthe War Council should set up a special committee to deal with Civil Defence.This proposal was approved. The same afternoon I presided over the first meetingof this Committee, which consisted of the Fortress Commander, Major-GeneralKeith Simmons; the Inspector-General of Police, Brigadier Dickinson; andMr. Denham, who represented the civilian community. Henceforward the Com-mittee met every afternoon at 4 p.m., and we usually had before us representa-tives of different departments of the civil service into whose activities we wishedto enquire.We interviewed the law officers in order to discuss the desirability of declaring Martial Law, representatives of the Department of Food Control on thesubject of rationing, the Registrar of Vehicles on the subject of transport, and theDirector of Passive Defence Services with regard to air raid precautions. Wehad before us, after the evacuation of Penang, a member of the Legislative council who had just arrived from that city, the officer who had been in charge of air raid precautions there, and a representative of the Penang Auxiliary Fire Service.We were anxious to learn from their experience, and having seen them we sent for the President of the Singapore Municipal Commissioners, the Chief of the fire Brigade, the Water Engineer, the Gas Engineer, the Electrical Engineer,the Municipal Engineer and the Manager of the Telephone Company.The result of these interviews and other subsequent ones showed that manygrave gaps existed in civil defence, and that a great deal remained to be done.We succeeded in securing the declaration of Martial Law and the registration of the entire population. The result of the latter, which we were at first informed
was impracticable, but which was carried out in a week, showed that theAuthorities had under-estimated the numbers of the population by nearly one-,quarter of a million the accepted figure having been 700,000 and the correctone proving to be over 900,000. This would have led to great inconvenience, if,the distribution of food had proceeded on the former assumption and no proper-system of rationing had been introduced. The registration of the populationfacilitated the introduction of a scheme of food rationing with food cards, whichwas already in hand at the time of my departure. We also arranged for the widest possible distribution of food stores, which had hitherto been confined to three warehouses situated in the centre of the town.The state of the Fire Brigade caused the gravest concern as they were foundto be extremely short both of machinery and of hose and had no means ofincreasing their equipment, which was lower than it had been before the outbreakof war. Nor had the Fire Brigade any knowledge concerning the buildings which contained essential stores and which therefore required to have priority over others in a general fire. We arranged for a committee of the service and civilian departments interested to draw up such a priority list.-Wp-wpre-a-lfffr-frhfeH^-^ n?      pipe-line which bringsthe water from Johore to Singapore and upon which the population is largely dependent. It was quite unprotected and might easily have been destroyed bysabotage.One of the later meetings was attended by a member of the Medical Collegewho was an expert in dietetics. He informed us that a shortage of freshvegetables might easily produce an outbreak of beri-beri. Vegetables could easily be grown in the island, but the population were mainly dependent on imported supplies. He suggested that steps should be taken to requisition land and plantvegetables under Government control. If this were done immediately the firstcrop could be produced within four months. On the following morning the WarCouncil approved of the necessary action being taken forthwith.The principal difficulty that had been experienced in Penang was the completedisappearance of all forms of labour which had followed upon the first air raid.Transport workers, clerks, telephone operators, post office employees, shopkeepersand even the police had vanished, and thus the civil administration and the normal;working of civilian life had been completely paralysed.This was largely due to the desire of the Asiatic population to place their wives and families in greater security, and, in the case of the police, the majority,having accomplished this purpose, subsequently returned to duty.We tried to prevent the repetition of such an occurrence in Singapore by two methods : First, by arranging for the wives and families of the police and ofthose engaged in essential industries to be placed in comparative safety beforethe danger should occur, and, secondly, by setting up properly disciplined labour&apos;corps of Chinese, Indians and Malays under European superintendence. we also arranged for feeding centres under Government control and for talks to begiven in public places on behaviour in air raids. &apos;Although the Committee was able to carry through these comparatively,simple improvements, I felt that we were not possessed of the technical know-ledge to enable us to detect shortcomings and deficiencies, and that a Committee,even one that met daily, did not afford the proper machinery for dealing withthese very urgent and vital matters. At one of our meetings we interviewedBrigadier Simson, Chief Engineer, Malaya Command. This officer had made aspecial study of air raid precautions and had lectured on the subject to theprincipal towns of Malaya since his arrival a few months before. I felt, and the.Committee agreed with me, that if he were in complete control of civil defence,with authority to give orders and to make appointments, much precious time would be saved in completing the necessary preparations. The War Councilapproved of the proposal, and Brigadier Simson was appointed ControllerGeneral of Civil Defence under the Governor.This appointment rendered superfluous the activities of the Civil DefenceCommittee, as it was intended to do. The Committee gradually ceased to function, but I kept closely in touch with Brigadier Simson, whom I saw almostdaily, and who accomplished a great deal, in spite of some reluctance toco-operate on the part of the civil authorities.Two tendencies were beginning to be noticeable in the proceedings of theWar CounciL towards the close of its activities.   In spite of the creation of ther23482] &apos; B 2
Civil Defence Committee and the appointment of Brigadier Simson, too great a proportion of the CounciTs time was still occupied in the discussion of civilmatters with which Service members were not closely concerned.At the same time there was noticeable a certain reluctance on the part ofService members to discuss operational matters, demanding the greatest secrecy,before so large an audience. The best method of meeting both these difficulties would probably have proved to be a reduction in the frequency of meetings of thefull Council and the creation of a smaller purely military council, with theMinister as Chairman, for the discussion of the conduct of operations.On 16th December information was received from London that president roosevelt was anxious that a War Conference should be held at Singapore simul-taneously with one in Moscow and one at Chungking, at which all the Allies inthe Far East should be represented, as well as Great Britain and the british dominions. Hope was also expressed that the Conference would be able, to reportby 20th December. Owing to the shortness of time it was impossible to arrangefor the Chinese Government and the Government of New Zealand to be repre-sented; but the latter agreed that I should act as their representative, with theassistance of a naval officer who had recently served in New Zealand.On the 18th December a meeting took place, attended by representatives fromthe three Services, by Major-General Gordon Bennett representing Australia, byan American Army Colonel and Navy Captain who were serving as liaison officers in Singapore and by similar representatives from the Netherlands. an interesting discussion took place and there was general agreement amongst allpresent.   -On the following day I circulated draft minutes of the meeting, togetherwith a draft telegram reporting the conclusions that had been reached. We metagain on the morning of the 20th December, when the minutes were generally approved, and the draft telegram underwent considerable amendment and expansion. It was also agreed that a further meeting should be held that after-noon of Service representatives only, to report upon the more technical aspectsof the situation and the more urgent reinforcements needed. This Committeealso reached complete agreement and we were able, before midnight on20th December, to send off two telegrams, one on the general situation and one on the more technical side of it, representing the agreed views of all who hadbeen consulted.If the war in the Pacific had continued to be directed from Singapore this incident would have furnished a valuable precedent for the creation of apermanent inter-Allied War Council. I was proposing to hold such meetings at fixed intervals once a month seemed at first sufficient and experience wouldhave shown how such a body was likely to develop and how useful was the taskit could perform. One of the earliest developments would probably have been theappointment by the Allied and Dominion Governments of more highly-placedofficers to represent them. The Chinese Government did, indeed, send aLieutenant-General to the Conference, but unfortunately he arrived a fortnightlate.Whether officers of the highest rank would have experienced greater difficulty in reaching complete agreement, it is impossible to say, but their presence at Singapore would certainly have increased the political and diplomatic duties of the Chairman of the War Council.As it was, such duties were light. My relations with the American, Chinese and Dutch Consuls-General, with the Australian representative and with therepresentative of the Free French were most friendly, but I had little business totransact with them. From the fact, however, that such business was light duringthe first four weeks of the war, it does not, of course, follow that it would have remained so.No two wars resemble one another identically, and no two situations arelikely to arise which will require precisely similar treatment, but looking backon the events of those four weeks I feel convinced that the experiment of a WarCouncil justified itself in the circumstances, that it performed a very usefulservice, and that on a similar occasion the experiment should be repeated. Thisview was shared by all members of the Council whom I consulted, and wasspontaneously voiced both by Sir Robert Brooke-Popham and by Sir ShentonThomas, the two members of the Council who, at the outset, had been mostdoubtful as to the need for its creation.
It afforded a regular daily opportunity for all those principally concernedin the conduct of the war to meet one another, and thus saved a great deal of correspondence, telephone calls, arrangement of interviews and minor meetings.It also produced, without any undue delay, agreed decisions on matters concerning which considerable divergence of opinion originally existed. Suchmatters were the proclamation of Martial Law, the evacuation of the civilian population, and the enforcement of the &quot; Scorched Earth &quot; policy.Further, it gave to the civilians on the one hand and to the military on theother useful and up-to-date knowledge of the problems with which they hadseverally to deal. For instance, it was of great value to the naval authoritiesto knew what demands were likely to be made upon them in connection withevacuation. It was of great value to the military authorities to be kept aware of the needs of the civil administration for transport. And it was equally ofgreat value to the civilians to know how the battle was progressing and the rapidity with which the advance of the enemy was considered likely to proceed.I am also of the opinion that the best chairman of such a War Council would always be a civilian, if possible with Cabinet experience. Such a one has, in thefirst place, the advantage conferred on him by his position of being able to speak with authority to the other members. He has also not only no reason for favouringthe military more than the civilian side or vice versa, but he has no sectionalinterests and no previous local preferences or prejudices. The experience ofCabinet Meetings is also of great value to one conducting a Council of this kind,where it is important to save time and to take decisions.To centralise in the hands of one individual the supreme direction of warwithin a defined area is certainly preferable to the creation of a War Council,but experience does not encourage the belief that powerful allies will often be willing in the early stages of war to place all their forces under one commander.The appointment of a Generalissimo in the Far East logically brought toan end the activities of the Resident Minister. There is no place for aGeneralissimo at the Council table of a civilian Minister, nor can a cabinet minister be included on the staff of a Generalissimo. It is possible and indeedlikely that General Wavell will find in the future that too much of his time isoccupied by questions of a political or diplomatic character which cannot be adequately dealt with by any of the existing members of his staff. If this difficulty arises, it can best be met by the appointment of an experienced memberof the Diplomatic Service to act as Political Adviser to the Generalissimo.(Initialled) DC.February 19, 1942.
