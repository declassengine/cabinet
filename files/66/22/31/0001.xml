Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1942.W.P. (42) 101.February 27, 1942.WAR CABINET.PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENTS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.ON the 30th June, 1941, I submitted to the War Cabinet a Memorandumon Horse Racing in War time which had previously been considered by theCivil Defence Executive Sub-Committee (W.P. (G) (41) 62). In the course ofdiscussion the Prime Minister strongly deprecated any attempt to put a stop tohorse racing and there was general agreement, with the view of the Minister ofLabour and National Service that it would bring.about a very unhealthy stateof affairs to stop football matches.   The War Cabinet agreed as follows : (1) Horse racing should not be discontinued.   An effort should be made tocarry it on in a restricted form.(2) The possibility should be explored of restricting Race Meetings toSaturday afternoons.(3) Race Meetings should not be held on courses which involved interferencewith railway traffic on congested lines.(4) Such steps as might be found practicable should be taken to prevent largeassemblies of motor cars at race meetings.I have accordingly defended this general line and its implication in theHouse of Commons.2. On the 25th February, 1942, the Lord Privy Seal said in the House ofCommons : &quot; We are not engaged in a War effort in which we can have as ourmotto &quot;Business as usual,&quot; or &quot;Pleasure as usual.&quot; The government propose to take such measures as may be necessary to prevent the abuse ofthe wishes of the majority of the people by any small or selfish group. Suchincidents as those mentioned by the hon. Member for Llanelly(Mr* J. Griffiths) in his opening speech, dog racing and boxing displaysamong them, are completely out of accord with the true spirit of determina-tion of the people in this crisis in their history, and steps will be taken to seethat such and similar activities are no longer allowed to offend the solidand serious intention of this country to achieve victory. &quot;-(Hansard,Vol. 378, No. 37, Column 314.)3. In so far as there is a general responsibility for licensed entertainmentsthis responsibility falls to the Home Secretary, but it has been exercised inconsultation with other Ministers interested, and it would have been desirable toobtain the views of the Ministers concerned before a statement of policy on thissubject was made. The views expressed by the Lord Privy Seal have arouseda great deal of public interest. It is, therefore, now necessary that the WarCabinet should consider the present position and make a decision on generalpolicy.[23509]SECRET V^Copy tip.     31
4. Control of Entertainments has been exercised by me as Minister ofHome Security through Orders under Defence Regulation 23 B.A., which providesfor the prohibition or restriction of assemblies and the use of premises as places of public resort &quot; in so far as such prohibition or restriction appears to theSecretary of State or Chief Officer of Police, as the case may be, to be necessaryin order to minimise the risk of loss of life or personal injuries being caused inconsequence of war operations.&quot;5.   My powers of control are thus restricted to the security aspect.6. While, during the lull in air attack, the security aspect has become lessprominent, other factors have assumed a steadily increasing importance. Atthe present time the governing considerations are the avoidance of unnecessaryuse of public transport, whether by road or rail, of interference with the transportof workers, of inducements to absenteeism and of waste of petrol. The transport and petrol aspects are, of course, departmentaliy matters for the Ministry ofWar Transport and the Petroleum Department. Though powers have not beentaken to restrict entertainments on these grounds, restrictions have, in fact, been secured by agreements with the interests concerned, which have usually beenhelpful, but these have no legal backing.7. Account has also been taken of the consideration that the harder thework the greater the need for some degree of reasonable recreation. An excessiveinterference with customary recreation might defeat its own ends by loweringmorale and this, in its turn, might affect production. The policy followed has accordingly been that of eliminating so far as possible, in consultation with the ministries of Labour and National Service, War Transport and the otherMinistries concerned, all features liable to conflict with the war effort, withoutat the same time depriving the worker of relaxation in his leisure hours.8. The present restrictions, which are summarised below, are substantial:: Horse Racing.9. The last programme approved for the Steeple-chasing season November1941-February 1942 was based on the following principles : (1) Restriction of Meetings to Saturdays.(2) Avoidance of interference with rail traffic (involving the elimination ofcertain courses).(3) Concentration of racing at places (actually five) within a reasonabledistance of training centres, to necessity of transporting horses.(4) Arrangement of hours to avoid interference with transport of workers.Greyhound Racing.10. Meetings are limited to one a week on each track, i.e., 52 days insteadof 104 a year. Afternoon racing is confined to Saturdays, public holidays andlocal early closing days. Afternoon meetings are arranged in consultation withthe Regional Transport Commissioner and the Welfare Officer of the Ministryof Labour and National Service. Attendance is restricted in evacuation areas to,000 or half the capacity of the track, whichever is less, except on tracks witha capacity of 80,000 or more, where up to 15,000 is allowed. No special facilitiesfor transport are allowed.Football.11. Football has, with few exceptions, been confined to Saturdays, public holidays and local early closing days. To avoid excessive travelling, the FootballLeague has abandoned its normal programme and special local competitions havebeen formed for area groups of Clubs. No special transport is provided forspectators, but the transport of teams by road, where no other reasonablefacilities exist, is allowed up to 50 miles for professional clubs and 25 miles foramateur clubs. Attendance is restricted on the same lines as at greyhound racing tracks, but in some cases larger numbers up to half the capacity of theground have been allowed for special occasions, such as international matches.
Theatres and Cinemas. , - .   ,    , . .   ;.12. These are governed by the general provisions of the Public Enter-tainments (Restrictions) Order, i.e., they may not be open after 11 p.m., hut chief constables have powers of prohibition and restriction and may fix an earlier :closing hour when they think it necessary on security grounds. During.theperiod of intense air attack this power was freely exercised, but more; recently ,Chief Constables were advised that the closing hour should not be fixed; earlier than 10 p.m. and that wherever possible the hour of 11 p.m., specified in the Order,should be allowed. The Object of this decision was to ensure that workers whohad been busy all day should have an opportunity of relaxation in the evenings.Where necessary, programmes are timed to avoid the release of patrons duringthe peak transport period.13. In Central London a special provision requires the permission of theCommissioner of Police before any place of entertainment is kept open after p.m. This power enables the Commissioner to regulate closing hours so as notto throw an excessive burden on public transport.Dancing.14. No general closing hour has been fixed, but the police have the same powers of prohibition and restriction as in regard to cinemas and theatres.Boxing.15. There has been little boxing on such a scale as to require action under defence Regulation 23 B.A.16. It will be seen from the above that although my emergency powers to prohibit or restrict public entertainments (which for this purpose includes horse-racing, &amp;c.) extend only to action taken in the interests of the public safety, ithas hitherto been possible to give effect to the decisions of the Government byagreement with the interests concerned. As exemplified by an obviouslyundesirable project, recently brought to my notice, to open a new greyhound racing track, however, it is clear that my powers are inadequate to enforcecompliance when public safety is not the issue. It therefore appears necessarythat the Government should be empowered to prohibit or restrict entertainmentson the ground that they are inimical to the war effort, irrespective of the degreeof risk to those present, and that the Defence Regulations should be amended to give control of entertainments in circumstances where the efficient prosecution of the war is in issue.In the administration of such an amended Regulation difficulty will nodoubt be experienced from time to time in dealing with entertainments which areobnoxious to particular schools of opinion, but nevertheless it seems clear thatsome much wider powers of control must be taken than the present limitedpower of dealing only with entertainments when there may be special risks owingto enemy action.17. As stated above, the policy carried out in regard to entertainments hasbeen to retain such recreation as is reasonably possible with a minimum inter -ference with transport and other services, whilst not ignoring the undesirabilityof excessive, wasteful and unnecessary entertainment.The issue now is : Should all or certain forms of entertainments be furtherrestricted in some of them there is not now much scope short of completecessation or should we frankly accept the doctrine of the more extreme critics which appears to be &quot; Total War must mean Total Misery &quot; and prohibit all orcertain forms of entertainment altogether?18. Will the War Cabinet please decide the general policy to be announcedand pursued ? - home Office,February 27, 1942.H. M.
