Printed for the War Cabinet.   March 1942.secret.P. (42) 103.February 28, 1942.Copy No.   31WAR CABINET.CANADA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I CIRCULATE, for the. information of the War Cabinet, a despatch bythe High Commissioner at Ottawa giving an account of the general politicalsituation in Canada.Since this despatch was written, Mr. Arthur Meighen has been defeated inone of a series of four by-elections, which resulted generally in victories ofMr. Mackenzie King&apos;s Government. Mr. Meighen&apos;s friends are now urging himto make a further attempt to enter the House of Commons at another by-election,but he has not yet decided what to do. In the meantime Mr. Hanson continuesto act as Leader of the Opposition.C. R. A.Downing Street,February 28, 1942., Office of the High Commissioner(No. 63.) for the United Kingdom,My Lord, \ Ottaxva, February 3, 1942.1. THIS is a sketch of Canada in war. It is drawn from material gatherednot only at the seat of Government in Ottawa, but also on wide travels rightacross the country.Party Strife.2. One of the main differences between the situation in Canada and thatin Britain is that in the Dominion the unity with which the nation is wagingwar against the enemy is to some extent disturbed by the violence with which thepolitical parties are waging war against each other. The Government is a purelyLiberal Administration supported by 178 members in the House of Commons.The Opposition consists of 40 Conservatives, 10 members of the New Democracyparty (whose main purpose is to introduce a form of Social Credit), 8 membersof the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (in other words, the Socialistparty), and two or three individual odds and ends. The Government has morethan the advantage thus given to it by numbers. The superiority gained for it by the quantity of its supporters is increased by their quality. Its cabinet ministers are a formidable team by Canadian standards, and three or four ofthem are pretty good men by any standard. Besides the Prime Minister himself,[23517] b
mr. Ilsley (Minister of Finance), Colonel Ralston (Minister for the Army), andMr. Howe (Minister of Munitions and Supply) are all in their own ways menof marked ability.3. Compared with this team, the Opposition have few men of striking-political ability and force. Probably the most capable man in Parliament outsidethe Government is Mr. Coldwell, the Leader of the Co-operative CommonwealthFederation, whose person and party will both certainly be heard much more ofin the future. The Conservative party has been led amiably but futilely byMr. Hanson, who suffers not only from the handicap of his own natural defects,but also from the circumstance that he has always been regarded as only a stop-gap Leader of the Opposition under notice to quit as soon as his political friendscould find a captain nearer to their hearfs desire. At a recent gathering of party chiefs from all corners of the Dominion, the choice for leadership fell uponMr. Arthur Meighen, an ex-Prime Minister of Canada, who for the last fewyears has been the Conservative Leader in the Senate. His return to the Houseof Commons (if he succeeds in winning the by-election which he is now fighting)will bring into that Chamber a man who is an eloquent speaker and the ablestParliamentary debater in the country. He will give the Conservative partystrong leadership. He will be a sharp thorn in the side of Ministers, or perhaps i should say a spur pricking them on to ever greater war-waging efforts. Yetmany even of his own nominal supporters (especially from beyond his homeProvince of Ontario) regret his election to the leadership, partly because herepresents, they assert, an old Toryism with which up-to-date Conservatives areout of sympathy, but chiefly because they fear that the dislike which he inspiresin French Canada and his own tendency to a bitter partisanship will decreaserather than increase the harmony of Canada&apos;s efforts to prosecute the war againstthe common enemy. His personal hatred of Mr. Mackenzie King (which thelatter heartily reciprocates) is salt which he will rub into the wounds which he proposes to inflict upon the Government.The Prime Minister.4. Much of the party battle rages round the personality of Mr. mackenzie king. His character is so dominant in the political scene that some appreciation of it is essential to an understanding of present-day Canada. By nature a man of peace, he has no gifts that strike the eye, still less that fire the imagination,as a war leader. He lacks dynamic energy, he has no particular knowledge orgrasp of military affairs, and though he sometimes rises to considerable heightsof eloquent speech, his oratory usually contains too little fire and too much windto be inspiring. When Canadians contemplate the company of remarkable menwho happen to be gathered upon the earth together at the present time to lead the nations grappling in this titanic struggle, they feel disappointed with theirown representative. It must be admitted that beside Churchill and Smuts inthe Empire, Roosevelt, Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek amongst our friends, andHitler in the ranks of our enemies, Mackenzie King is a somewhat unglamorousfigure. These giants have spoilt the market for more ordinary mortals. Yetthere is at present no serious alternative in Canada, and even the Prime Minister&apos;scritics appear baffled when they are asked to name from the available candidatesa more suitable holder of his office. In the absence of any rival there is not yetany threat to his position. But it is unfortunate for Canada at war that herleader does not command nation-wide loyalty, and this is one reason why theDominion is rather disunited and unhappy within itself.5. Mr. King&apos;s friends and supporters naturally rally to him with a devotionwhich at least balances the hostility of his detractors. And a hint of the remarkable quality which is in him is contained in the fact that he is the completemaster of his Cabinet. As I have already noted, this is a body containing anumber of men of good ability; yet there is not one of them who is regardedeither by himself or by anybody else as a rival of Mr. King for the leadership.There is just a touch of the schoolmaster about his authority. Inveterate smokersamongst his colleagues put away their pipes when he comes into the cabinet room, because he dislikes smoking. He calls his colleagues by their Christiannames, but they usually call him &quot; Sir &quot; or &quot; Chief.&quot; I have never heard anypolitician on this continent, except his fellow alumnus of Harvard, President
Roosevelt, address him by any one of his three Christian names. Though he isa very pleasant guest in company, a charming host in his own houses, and adelightful friend prepared to reveal the intimate turns of his thoughts to thosewho have his confidence (and occasionally to complete strangers), there is analoofness about him which perhaps only the late M. Lapointe amongst his political colleagues was able to penetrate.6. But there he is, in unchallenged, absolute command of his Government.The secret of his sway is his much longer and broader political experience thanr belongs to anyone else in the country. He first sat in a Dominion Cabinet ink 1909; for more than twenty-one years he has been the undisputed leader of theLiberal party; and for over fifteen of those years he has been Prime Minister ofthe Dominion, outlasting a whole series of Conservative leaders. As an adroitparty politician he has no superior in any country in the world. This very skillhas sometimes led to a suspicion that he is nothing more than a supremely cleverparty politician, and I confess that I have sometimes been amongst those whoformed that judgment of him. But, during much talk with him here, I haveenjoyed better opportunities of comprehending his character. Its complexityis an interesting study, but I will only trouble you with some matters touchingit which make him, in my view, a man able to do some signal services to Britain,the British Empire and the cause of humanity during and after the war.7. Through the long spring and summer of his experience in governmenthis native political shrewdness has ripened into statesmanlike wisdom. He ispatient and far-sighted, and would never make the sort of mistakes which a young, inexperienced Prime-Minister-in-a-hurry like Mr. R. G. Menzies, withall his much greater brilliance, made. He is consistent, dependable and loyal.His fundamental policy is based on deep religious and political beliefs. He isa Presbyterian and Liberal, of what some would call, of course with great respect,the old school. The sincerity with which he holds his beliefs is the explanationwhy this man, who is often called by his critics a pacifist, is passionatelydetermined that the war shall be waged mercilessly until Hitler and all his works have been wiped from the face of the earth. For Hitlerism is a denial of every-thing in his faith. We can count on Mr. Mackenzie King being a faithfulcomrade through the war, however long and arduous the journey may be.8. His first great war service to his country and our cause was bringing a united Canada into the battle. The French-Canadians and Canadian&apos;&apos; isolationists&apos;&apos; might have been lukewarm or even hostile, on the grounds thatthe quarrel was a European one which might concern the people of Britain butcertainly should not involve the citizens of Canada, who in any case were &apos;&apos; sittingpretty &quot;with American authority and power to protect them. A Prime minister who emphasised too much the element of fighting to support Britain might have produced this result. Mr. King has never scorned to use the argument that britain should be supported for her own glorious sake, but he was also at pains to explain that Canada&apos;s interests themselves as such, as well as wider obligations of honour, demanded that the Dominion should go to war against Hitler. by being pro-Canadian rather than pro-British he has gained the confidence of theFrench-Canadian section of the country as no other English-speaking PrimeMinister has ever done. And, by unheroic but shrewd and prudent statesmanshipbefore and since the outbreak of war, with the loyal support of the late French-Canadian leader, M. Lapointe, he has brought and kept a united canadian  action. This unity was never achieved in the last war. As will appear froma later part of this despatch, the first concern of any true Canadian statesmanmust be to preserve and strengthen that essential unity within this young nation.9. Some of his critics will tell you that Mr. King is anti-British and pro-American. Well, he is a Canadian nationalist of a not too aggressive type in whose political make-up there is, no doubt, some remnant of offence caused byold-fashioned British Imperialists in the past who were then unsympathetic tothe national aspirations of the Dominions. Also he regards it as tfie duty of a prime Minister of Canada to establish the most excellent relations possiblebetween his country and its gigantic American neighbour. Incidentally, it wouldbe unfortunate for us if he did not. But I do not know anyone in the Dominionwho is more genuinely pro-British. It may be true that this sentiment in himhas been greatly strengthened by the war. He is not quite the same Mackenzie[23517] b 2
King as existed in pre-war days. He has been deeply moved by the heroicresistance of the British people&quot; during the Battle of Britain. He feels withsomething amounting to reverence that just as Britain has been the guardianof many people&apos;s liberties in the past, so she has once more been the saviour ofthose liberties in the present. And at the same time he has grown more andmore impatient at America&apos;s attitude. He admires greatly his friendFranklin Roosevelt, in particular, but speaks sarcastically of the american people in general. So little is he pro-American and anti-British that in mattersof policy where there has appeared some divergence between the points of viewof the British and United States Governments he has always in discussions with me supported the British point of view. That he was prepared not only in private but also in public to join in exerting strong influence on America to do what we wanted was shown by his outspoken speeches in London and Ottawalast August and September, which openly urged America&apos;s entry into the war.This was a sign of the new, more robust Mackenzie King, who even a year agowould have been shocked by any suggestion that he should make such speeches.10. This attitude of his may be even more helpful in the future. clearly the hope of the world will depend largely after the war on co-operation betweenthe British Commonwealth of Nations and the United States of America. Inthe course of that co-operation there are likely to be some quite serious differences of opinion between Britain and America. I believe Mr. Mackenzie King willgenerally be a firm supporter of ours in these controversies of the future. Hecan be a peculiarly valuable one, because he is himself a North American whoenjoys a certain respect and influence amongst the American leaders and public.11. The charges of his critics become, of course, even more fantastic whenthey urge that he is anxious to withdraw Canada from the British Commonwealthof Nations and incorporate it in the United States of America. The reverse is his desire. I think it is his fear of the power of attraction which Canada&apos;smighty next-door-neighbour may exert on some Canadians that makes himsometimes feel so acutely critical of the United States. It is his firm politicalpurpose to preserve Canadian independence as a partner nation inside the BritishCommonwealth. In many discussions with me he has spoken of the sections ofopinion in the Dominion who might feel tempted to cut the painter with Britain.It may be that his anxiety about this is deeper than the situation warrants, andthat his policy for countering any such tendency is over-subtle. Yet one must remember that for two decades now he has shown himself a surer reader of theCanadian mind than anyone else. And to reveal his own attitude it is worthrecording briefly some reflections which he expressed to me shortly after America&apos;sentry into the war. He said that so far the war had done more to unite theDominions closely to Britain than any event in the present century much more,for instance, than did the last war. He hoped that the conflict would end withthat happy state of affairs even further strengthened. But the entry of Americainto the war, welcome though that was from most points of view, might resultin a rather disturbing situation in Canada. North America, including of courseCanada, was now more than ever likely to suffer some form of physical assaultby the enemy. He was extremely anxious that the Dominion should in that eventhave sufficient armed forces present on Canadian soil or in Canadian skies andwaters to defend them without undue assistance from the United States. For ifthe Canadian soldiers, sailors and airmen were overseas, in Britain and elsewhere,to such an extent that the Americans had to come to Canada&apos;s rescue, there wouldbe a considerable feeling amongst some sections of the population encouraged by the secessionists that the British connection was a liability instead of anasset, and that the plain facts of the situation showed that Canada was an american country dependent on the United States for protection and security.This would play into the hands of those who are waiting for a favourable opportunity to urge that Canada should no longer be a nation belonging to theBritish Commonwealth, but a nation belonging to the Western Hemisphere. Hisapprehension about this has made him react very strongly against varioustentative American suggestions since the 7th December that there should be ajoint command, with an American Commander-in-Chief, over the defence of this or that part of the North American coasts. It does not lead him to desire anydiminution whatever in the strength of Canada&apos;s forces serving overseas. Onthe contrary, he favours a steady increase in that strength, for he is fully conscious
of the fact that Hitler can only be defeated in Europe.   But this other elementdoes make him resist the placing of too great an emphasis on Canadians&apos; duty-to serve overseas, and insist on a balanced development between the home defence and overseas military forces of the Dominion. &apos;.. .12. It is of high importance that we should understand these attitudes ofMr. Mackenzie King&apos;s mind in dealings with him during war and at its close.He can be very helpful to us in securing the proper relationship between Britain,the Dominions and the United States of America in the crucial post-war period.However, it is conceivable that he will be out of office before then. His politicalenemies in Canada are out for his blood; they are determined to bring him down;and though they often weaken their case by overstating it, their sweeping andnot always very scrupulous criticisms have their effect in undermining his authority. He has grown a fairly tough political hide, yet the prospect of the advent of Mr. Arthur Meighen to the leadership of the Opposition in the Houseof Commons seems to have rattled him a bit. Astute Parliamentarian though heis, the anticipation of having to. face almost &quot;daily, amidst the other troubles ofa Prime Minister in these times, Mr. Meighen, whose debating power strikes like a shower of poisoned arrows at: his opponents when his tongue is at its cleverestand bitterest, rather unnerves him. He looks worried and tired more frequentlythan he used to do, and he is now 67 years old.13. Whatever happens, Mr. Meighen&apos;s accession will stir up the fury ofthe party conflict to red, and perhaps even white, heat. It is true that, amongst other things, the new Conservative Leader is advocating the formation of aNational Government to lead the country in war, and offering the LiberalGovernment the hearty co-operation of the Conservative party. This would, ofcourse, be the right solution, if it were politically and personally practicable.But few people really believe that a Cabinet in which Mr. King and Mr. Meighenwere colleagues would be a harmonious, efficient or long-lived organ of government,and most people are sceptical about Mr. Meighen&apos;s sincerity in making the offerin present circumstances. Anyway, the Prime Minister himself has told me that,if he were to invite Mr. Meighen into the Government, he would automatically,lose the support of very important sections of his own Liberal and French-Canadian followers, and he added, confidentially, that he had already rejected a tentative and informal offer of co-operation inside the Government which mr. Hanson, with Mr. Meighen&apos;s knowledge, recently made to him. The faultlies on both sides.The Racial Division.14. These party divisions are unfortunate enough -in war time. But thereis in this country another, rift which is more serious, and which bids fair tomenace both in war and peace the development of Canada as a fundamentallyunited nation. To: some extent the bitter party strife is only an outwardexpression of this deep inner division. It is the racial division betweenFrench-Canadians and Anglo-Saxon Canadians. Canadians sprung from otherstocks in Europe Poles,. Germans, Ukrainians and others-also present a problem : but, thoiigh their numbers, are considerable, these communities are not so compact and large as to constitute a problem of such absolutely first-ratenational importance as that created by French-Canada. Moreover, their historyin Canada did not begin with a long-sustained and bitter hostility to the British.On the contrary, they came to Canada as immigrants desiring the security and freedom afforded within the British Commonwealth.15. The French-Canadians count about 3,500,00,0 in a population of about11,500,000, and form a more or less solid bloc throughout Quebec Province and parts of the neighbouring Provinces of New Brunswick and Ontario. The friction between them and their Anglo-Saxon fellow countrymen should not be over-stated.There is no question whatever about the loyalty to the British connection of thevast majority of French-Canadians. By tradition monarchists, they feel a specialattachment to the British Monarchy in. an age when heads that wear crowns havebeen having a more than usually uneasy time. And as some French-Canadianleaders have been at pains to urge, their connection with Britain is even moreimportant to French-Canadians than it-is to other Canadians, because the former[23517] b 3
are a minority in the country, and continued association with Britain is thebest guarantee of their freedom and rights. Canadians selected from both racessit as cordial colleagues in the Dominion Cabinet; legislators of both races are-fellow members of the Dominion Parliament, and civil servants drawn from thetwo communities co-operate together in some of the Government. Departments.But it is significant that the French-Canadian Parliamentarians (numbering 70)are, with the solitary exception of an Independent member, supporters of theLiberal party. None of the other parties at present hold any Federalconstituency in any part of French-Canada.16. Despite all this there is a traditional French-Canadian animosityagainst the British, born of their defeat at our hands in days long ago. Itthrived on the memory of that humiliation for a long time, and has only morelately been buried under a growing heap of goodwill resulting from the fairtreatment and freedom which French-Canadians enjoy under the British Crown.However, the hostility is not yet dead; it is only buried alive; and it would stillbe possible to dig up the body and restore its vitality. For example, a terribleamount of anti-British feeling was stirred up in Quebec during the last war bythe stupid way in which the authorities of the day handled an awkward situationin the province. The French-Canadians were half-hearted about supporting thewar, and recruiting amongst them went badly. In that crisis a general who couldspeak no French was put in command of the Quebec district, and a vigorousNonconformist parson was put in charge of recruiting in this intensely roman catholic province! Various public insults were hurled at the French-Canadians,and later conscription was forced on them against their almost unanimous will.The harm which this whole episode caused to relations between the two supposedlypartner races in Canada has not been wiped out in the quarter of a century whichhas followed. It has caused a two-way ill-will. On the one hand, the French-Canadians were so deeply incensed by the introduction of conscription amongsttheir population that they encouraged many of their young men to escape intothe woods and resort to other devices to avoid its clutches. On the other hand,the Anglo-Saxon Canadians generally were enraged by this unwillingness ofFrench-Canadians to share all the sacrifices of a war to defend their common life,liberty and happiness.17. The old antagonism is latent in the present situation. The new war has reopened some old wounds. There are extremists in both racial communities.Some of the more robust and aggressive citizens of British stock in places likeToronto, Hamilton and Vancouver are viciously outspoken in their dislike anddistrust of their French-speaking compatriots. There is no limit to the accusations-tions which they will throw around. I have often heard them seriously describeall the most trusted leaders of French-Canada as a gang of Fifth Columnists, andthey are constantly making insulting references to Quebec&apos;s supposed lukewarm-ness about the present war. This plays into the hands of a small minority ofextremists in French-Canada who keep up a haggard agitation for throwing offthe &quot; British yoke.&quot; These are extreme expressions of view which do not atpresent command any wide volume of support on either side; yet they representa misunderstanding and friction which are fairly widespread in a milder form,and which might be roused to fever pitch again if any issue were forced whichdivided Canadians on racial lines.Conscription.18. Many people have for long tried, from the highest motives, of course,to raise such an issue by demanding the immediate introduction of full-bloodedconscription in this war. Mr. Meighen nailed the flag of unlimited compulsory military service very firmly to his party&apos;s mast as soon as he became the captain of the Opposition crew. At present there is conscription for home defence butnot for overseas service. Naturally, as I say, the intentions of those who advocate the more drastic measure are highly patriotic. It is galling to many Canadiansthat there is not unqualified conscription in this supreme crisis of human affairs,and the wiser heads amongst the conscriptionists defend their policy byasserting that it would not now split the country, since French-Canada is muchmore hearty in its support for this war than it was between 1914 and 1918.
19. It is undoubtedly true that French-Canadians are much more convincedand eager participants in war now than they were then. Indeed, with theexception of recruitment for the armed forces, the present war effort in Quebecis a creditable one. The charges of lukewarmriess in sentiment and backward-ness in accomplishment made by critics in some of the other Provinces are not,with this single though important exception, just. Opinion in favour of wagingthe war until Germany is decisively defeated is sound in Quebec. This is largely due to the unswerving leadership up to the moment of his death two months agoof the late M. Lapointe, and to the strong support for the war given inthe Province by Cardinal Villeneuve and other leading churchmen as well asby the excellent Premier of the Province, M. Adelard Godbout. At one time thedownfall of France and the surrender of the men of Vichy introduced somedifficult and dangerous cross-currents into the flow of French-Canadian opinion in support of total war against Germany. But those disturbances have now ceased to trouble even the surface, and certainly the depths, of Quebec politics. French-Canadians have a high personal regard for Marshal Petain on account of hisreputation as a good Catholic and authoritarian who might just conceivablyreintroduce the ancient power of the Church and the Monarchy in France asthey existed before 1789. French-Canadians have always regretted the FrenchRevolution. But their sentimental regard for the aged Marshal is now thebeginning and end of their respect for Vichy. Ninety-five per cent, of the French-Canadian population are, so far as France&apos;s position in the war is concerned.anti-Vichy and pro-de Gaulle.20. In their willing payment of heavy war taxes, their contributions to warloans, and their building of ships and production of aeroplanes, tanks, guns andthe other munitions and sinews of war, the tremendous efforts of the people ofQuebec can compare generally with those of the citizens of any other Provincein the Dominion. It is in recruitment for the armed forces that there is room for unfavourable comparison. Why is there this persistent weakness in French-Canada? Various elements join to produce it. Partly it is due to the old,hard-dying suspicion of the British which makes the French-Canadian&quot; habitant,&quot; however willing he may be to join the army and fight on Canadiansoil in defence of Canada, very dubious about going and fighting on Europeansoil solely in defence, the extremist politicians tell him, of Britain. Partly it isdue to the fear of priests and parents that if Quebec&apos;s sons go overseas theirChurch and homes may lose their present powerful influence over them. Partlythe language difficulty is in the way; French-Canadians do not relish the ideaof going into regiments with English-speaking officers and getting into troublefor being unable to understand the orders issued to them, and the proportion ofFrench-Canadians qualified to become officers themselves is low. Partly it is justgeneral ignorance. One has to realise that the great majority of French-Canadians live in remote and poor communities. Their contact with the outside world is much less than that of the average modern agricultural village; they see few newspapers and hear comparatively little broadcasting; their education is of a poor standard, and, in fact, they do not have the same opportunities as most of their contemporaries in civilised countries to comprehend what greatissues are at stake in the war.21. The Government have so far firmly resisted the demand for total:conscription. Ministers say that up to the present they have secured all the menwhom they need for the fighting services by voluntary recruitment. Withoutdoubt, however, the main and overwhelming reason for their attitude is fear ofarousing grave hostility in Quebec. Mr. Mackenzie King has often told methat, if he were to force the conscription issue as such now,, there would be aserious split in both the country and the Government, He has had a very difficultjob keeping his Cabinet together on the issue lately. There are a few sturdychampions of conscription inside the Cabinet, the most prominent of whom areMr. Ralston and Mr. Ilsley; but the majority of Ministers are still opposed to it,and the Prime Minister tells me categorically that on that issue most of them,including all the representatives of French-Canada, would resign.22. However, the situation never has been, and is not now, static. It hasbeen moving forwards towards an acceptance of conscription. It is alia matterof careful handling and timing;   There can be no doubt whatever that any
introduction of the measure hitherto would have destroyed Canadian unity andgravely prejudiced the whole of Canada&apos;s war effort. How strong the opposition would be in Quebec if the policy were now advocated with firm conviction by theGovernment as a measure necessary to win the war it is hard to say. If it were accompanied by a propaganda campaign supported by the leaders of the roman catholic Church, it would be most likely to succeed. Yet those whose judgmentI would be most inclined to trust on this question tell me that even then the splitin opinion would still be so bad as to do fearful harm, and they urge a further postponement of the direct issue itself. Nevertheless, the French-Canadians are certainly getting more and more reconciled to the prospect of full conscription.Two factors are leading their opinion in the right direction. First, they have become increasingly impressed by the seriousness and power of the threat fromHitler and his confederates, and &quot;by the need to take every step required to defeathim. Secondly, French-Canadian priests, parents and youths are learning fromexperience that life in the army does not have the Corrupting effect on the religion,morals and general well-being of soldiers that they feared. The ecclesiasticaland parental authorities have found that when their young men return on leaveafter some months of soldiering, they are just as devoted Catholics and sons as theywere before, that their characters are generally no better and no worse, and thattheir physical fitness has undergone a great improvement.23. This evolution of French-Canadian sentiment in the right directionseems to offer a reasonable justification for the tactics which the Government have adopted in handling this most critical of Canadian issues. They started by introducing the thin edge of the conscription wedge and have been driving itever since steadily further and further home. First, under the National ResourcesMobilisation Act, passed in June 1940, they registered all single men between the ages of 19 and 45 as liable for military service inside Canada. Then, a fewmonths later, they decreed thirty days&apos; compulsory military training for homedefence for those between the ages of 21 and 24; later still the thirty days were increased to four months; and yet later the Government announced that theconscripts would be retained in the army for the duration of the war, though they would still only be liable compulsorily for home defence duty. Theseconscript units have been posted to coastal and other home stations, thus releasingother units who were free to go to war overseas. And having got these conscriptsinto the army, the military authorities started an energetic campaign to recruitfrom amongst them volunteers for overseas service, which met with quite anamount of success. By these means the Government have raised considerableforces for home defence, reinforced steadily General MacNaughton&apos;s troops in britain, and also had troops to send to Imperial outposts such as Hong Kong.At the same time they have preserved the greatest practicable degree of Canadianunity, whilst educating French-Canadians up to a point where conscription for overseas service might be accepted without serious demur.24. They have now decided that the time has come for the next, ratherhesitant, step forwards. The entry of Japan and America into the war, and america&apos;s immediate imposition of conscription for military service anywhere in the wide world, have given a great stimulus to the agitation for all-outconscription here. Apart from any other considerations it would have beenexceedingly difficult, if not impossible, in these circumstances for the Governmentto make no further advance. But they feel bound by their specific election pledgenot to introduce conscription for overseas service without a further appeal tothe electorate; and they have now, therefore, decided to hold a plebiscitethroughout the Dominion. It is not on the direct question for and againstconscription, but asks the people to release them from their pledge and give themfreedom to introduce such conscription whenever they deem it necessary in orderto keep the Canadian military forces up to the strength demanded by the war.This proposal has raised a storm of controversy. There is much bitter criticism of it as clumsy, unnecessary and another example of Mr. King&apos;s timidity. the critics say that he could have &quot; got away with &quot; a manly declaration that hispledge was given to the electors in very different circumstances, and that thegrim necessities of total war now demand that the Government shall, withoutmore ado, direct the complete and unfettered mobilisation of Canadianmail-power. But the Prime Minister says that, if he were to go back on his election pledge without specific authority from the people, the French-Canadians
would never trust him or his Government or any other English-speaking leaderagain. His new policy has caused the defection of two members from his party,one a Erench-Canadian who is opposed to conscription and thinks that the plebiscite goes too far, the other an Anglo-Saxon who favours conscription andthinks^ the plebiscite does not go far enough. Apart from this happy piece ofinsignificant cancelling-out, the policy seems, to be unanimously approved by thePrime Ministers Parliamentary supporters, French-Canadian and otherwise.25. The controversy has already let loose some strong gusts of politicalpassion, and it looks as though the decks are being cleared for an unpleasant actionin which some wounds to unity between the two predominant races in the country can scarcely be avoided. It is unfortunate that two months should apparently berequired before the plebiscite can be taken, but the Government say that theycannot complete the legislative and other necessary arrangements in time to makethe battle any shorter. The success or failure of the plebiscite depends chieflyon whether or not there is in the Province of Quebec a vote in favour of releasingthe Government from its pledge. The voting elsewhere is a foregone conclusion.Some people who know their Quebec well tell me that the affirmative will becarried, others who know the province equally well that it will be defeated.Who am I to express an opinion % Yet I cannot conceive that so astute andpatriotic a leader as Mr. Mackenzie King has launched on this perilous enterprisewithout an assurance from the heads both of Church and State in Catholic Canadathat he will get what he wants.26. But this is an extremely critical time for Canada. I shall revisit Quebecin the near future, and report to you further on the temper in the province.Canada5 s War Effort.27. Mr. Mackenzie King complained at the opening of the presentParliamentary debate on the plebiscite that the concentration of the Opposition^critical attention on the issue of conscription for overseas service has obscuredthe broad view of Canada&apos;s war effort over the whole wide field of belligerentactivities. General information on this effort is, of course, available in London.The main details of Canada&apos;s war effort may be summed up as follows :  28. By conscription for home service and voluntary enlistment for overseas service the Dominion has already more men in its armed forces than it had atany time in the last war. As regards the army overseas, there are now threeinfantry divisions and corps troops, an armoured division and an army tankbrigade in Britain, and Mr. Mackenzie King has foreshadowed this force&apos;sexpansion into a two-corps army during the present year. There are canadian troops elsewhere beyond Canada, and all the world knows how they receivedtheir baptism of fire in the heroic defence of Hong Kong.29. As for the Canadian navy, having commenced the war with six destroyers and nine smaller ships, it has been breeding corvettes, minesweepersand other small vessels like rabbits ever since, and now has a fleet totalling morethan 300 ships manned entirely by Canadian sailors. These active service officersand men, who before the war numbered less than 2,000, have increased to morethan 27,000, and in particular they are engaged night and day in the Battle ofthe Atlantic.30. Young Canadian aviators in the B-.C.A.F. or the R.A.F. have been flying in the front clouds of battle ever since the great air fights in Europe began. InCanada the Empire Air Training Scheme is a unique, and may be a decisive,contribution to victory. It is administered by the Canadian authorities tosuch good effect that it is now about twice as fruitful in pilots, observers and airgunners as was originally envisaged. From its 85 schools it has already producedsome 15,000 air-crew graduates. In addition a number of R.A.F. schools havealready been transferred to the excellent training grounds and skies of Canada,and more are to follow, so that their pupils may perfect their wings here beforeflying to hammer the Huns.
31. Canada has met every request for the production and shipping of food-stuffs that we have so far made, and her output of many weapons and munitions of war has waxed until it is now proceeding on a gigantic scale. Ships, tanks,aeroplanes, guns, shells, small-arms ammunition, &amp;c, are flowing out of the shipyards and factories in quantities which are very remarkable for a countrywhose secondary industries were not considerable two years ago.32. Much of this production of arms and munitions is for the service ofCanada&apos;s own fighting men. But much in addition is produced to the orderof the United Kingdom Government. And though that Government have notpossessed the dollars to pay for most of these supplies, that circumstance has notled to a moment&apos;s delay in the production or delivery of any weapon. TheCanadian taxpayers have footed the bill and been content to build up its equivalent in sterling balances in London, which, under the recent financial arrangement,have now been turned into a loan (interest-free for the duration of the war)of $700 million. But the Canadian Government are anxious to avoid thedifficulties which would arise for both countries from a further piling up of sucha debt, and they have therefore announced that, as from two months ago, all the munitions and sinews of war produced in Canada for Britain will bean outright gift from the former to the latter to the tune of $1,000 million.It is calculated that this piece of munificence should see us through until aboutMarch 1943, and I anticipate that, after that, a second gift of appropriatedimensions will follow.33. These are gigantic details in the war effort of a country of 11,500,000people. There are also some other hefty bits and pieces of policy which showresolution to prosecute the war with the maximum possible vigour and efficiency.For instance, to prevent inflation there has been in operation since the autumn ascheme of &quot; ceilings &quot; to prices and wages, which is being administered with considerable ability, boldness and success. Again, the organisation for poolingraw materials and engaging in complementary production &quot;of war weapons withthe United States has been well conceived and administered in Canada.34. The chief danger to the continual and steady expansion of all these efforts by a united and determined people lies in the threat of a new quarrelbetween the French-Canadian community and the rest of the nation. It mustbe devoutly hoped that such a set-back will not occur. The main concern of theCanadian people generally is that they are not doing enough to help theircomrades-in-arms in the British Empire and Allied countries, and their mosteager desire is to increase their effort until it is worthy of the great issues whichare at stake for us all.I have the honour to be,My Lord,Your Lordship&apos;s most obedienthumble servant,MALCOLM MacDONALD.
