Thequestion whether the scheme should be extended to cover Brighton and neigh-bouring towns also arose.The Home Defence Committee prepared a report on the subject (H.D. (42) 1Final) (Appendix II), which the Lord Privy Seal referred to the Civil DefenceCommittee for consideration by the Civil Ministers concerned.The Civil Defence Committee discussed the report of the Home DefenceCommittee at a meeting at which the Service Departments were speciallyrepresented; and the attached report (Appendix I) embodies the conclusions reached at that meeting.H. M.Home Office, February 17, 1942.[23481]b
APPENDIX I.Civil Defence Committee.MODIFICATION OF COMPULSORY EVACUATION SCHEME.Report by the Chairman.THE,Civil Defence Committee has had under consideration the attached report of the Home Defence Committee (H.D. (42) 1, Final) on proposedmodifications of the scheme for the compulsory evacuation in the event of invasion of certain towns at or near the coast of South-East England.2. Plans already exist for the compulsory evacuation.of the 27 coastal townsin East Anglia, Essex, Kent and Sussex from Great Yarmouth to Newhaven.and also of the inland towns of Ipswich, Colchester, Canterbury and Ashford(making 31 in all). These plans can be carried out either as a single operationor in two stages. The first (Stage A) consists of the compulsory evacuation ofschoolchildren and the voluntary evacuation of mothers and young children, andthe second (Stage B) covers the rest of the civil population -except those requiredto remain to assist the army. The operation of the plans requires Cabinetsanction,&apos; and it was understood that, while the sanction to Stage A might begiven at an early phase in the enemy&apos;s preparations, sanction to Stage B (or tothe whole plan as a single operation) would only be given when it became apparent that the enemy intended to strike.3. The report of the Home Defence Committee deals with two subjects:(a) the timing of compulsory evacuation and (b) the proposed inclusion in thescheme,of the Brighton group of towns.Timing of the Operation of the Scheme.4. The Home Defence Committee state that the Commander-in-Chief, home forces, is gravely concerned lest authority to evacuate the thirty-one towns shouldbe delayed until it becomes impossible to complete the operation because of the bombing of.,communications and possibly the onset oL. invasion. The HomeDefence Committee accordingly propose that plans should be prepared on thebasis that the scheme would be put into operation not less than 21 days beforethe zero hour when the enemy would have completed his preparations. Zerohour would be 30 days after the Chiefs of Staff had i&apos;reached the conclusion thatpreparations for invasion were so far advanced that it could be launched at theend of a month. The scheme put into operation would be either the scheme as awhole or Stage B if the children and their mothers had already been removedunder a Stage A evacuation.5. We recognise that, from an administrative and operational point of view,there is everything to be gained by timing compulsory evacuation so. that it islikely to go through without serious interruption by enemy air attacks.6. At the same time it must be recognised that if evacuation is orderedbefore the public are fully aware of the risk of invasion it will be a matter ofthe greatest difficulty to induce the population of these towns to leave. Moreover,the billeting of entire families on households in the reception areas will produce a state of extreme discomfort which the population of the reception areas will only be willing to accept if they are persuaded that a national emergency of the gravest character is at hand.7. Further, the earlier that evacuation is ordered the greater the risk of a false alarm. If evacuation were ordered and invasion hung fire, discontent would arise both among the evacuees who would want to return home, and among thosewho had been required to accommodate them in reception areas. It is very doubtful whether, if evacuation had once been carried out and it proved to be unnecessary, the operation: could be successfully staged a second time.8. In spite of these disadvantages we accept the revised proposals as tothe timing of evacuation, provided that it is understood that the Cabinet before
authorising evacuation will take account of all the relevant considerations at thetime. Evacuation should not be an automatic move following a warning by theChiefs of Staff Committee that the-enemy would be in a position to invade in amonth&apos;s time.Inclusion of Brighton in the Scheme.9.   The Home Defence Committee in their report state that, in the view ofthe Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, the presence of the civil population inthe Brighton group of towns and the possibility of refugees blocking the fewapproach roads through the Downs would be so great a handicap to the armed force as to prejudice the successful defence of the country.   The towns whichthe Home Defence Committee recommend should be included in the compulsoryevacuation scheme are-Brighton, Southwick,Hove,                                   Worthing, andShoreham,                              Littlehampton.Portslade,10. The proposal that these towns should be included in the evacuationscheme was put forward by the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, in September1940, and again in the Spring of 1941. On neither occasion would the WarCabinet commit itself to the view that a scheme of evacuation should be preparedfpr these towns.11. Since that date the situation has no doubt somewhat changed. Invasion,if it now happens, is likely to be much more fully prepared, and there will therefore be longer notice of the enemy&apos;s intentions. This would allow timefor evacuation, which was not expected under the conditions previously envisaged,and the risk of interruption would be lessened.12. The Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, has prepared the followingmilitary appreciation, dated the 11th February, 1942, which has the support ofthe Naval Staff, Imperial General Staff and Air Staff : (i) The coastal area between Brighton and Littlehampton is one of themost vulnerable and dangerous areas in the country. The sea passage from France is short, it is within the enemy&apos;s fighter cover, and the route Northwards is the quickest approach to London which will undoubtedly be the enemy&apos;s main objective. A very recent survey hasshown that the beaches are eminently suitable for the landing of tanks, wheeled vehicles and troops,(ii) Immediately behind the coastal towns lies the South Downs, which areideally suited for the landing of large numbers of parachute andairborne troops. Enemy troops so landed would be in a position toattack the beach defences from the rear and to hold the line of theSouth Downs against our reinforcements coming from the North.The bridgehead so formed would make it relatively simple for theenemy to land a large and formidable force with London as its immediate objective. Further, a successful enemy advance from theBrighton area on London would place the forces defending Kent ina most dangerous position.(iii) To meet this threat it is essential that our armoured and mobile reservesfrom the North and North-West should reach the area in the shortest possible time. It is on these reserves that we rely mainly to repelinvasion, and on their rapid movement the success or failure of our operations will depend. Unfortunately, as the map attached with.D. (42)* 1 shows, the roads available are few and pass throughdefiles in the South Downs. It is, therefore, absolutely vital thatthese roads should be clear.(iv) All recent military experience has shown that whenever a town isattacked part or all of the population will form a refugee movement.The attack is almost invariably preceded by heavy bombing, causingfire on a large scale and, however stout-hearted the population, it is* Appendix 2.[23481] b 2
impossible to &quot; Stay Put &quot; in a burning house. Moreover, there isan enormous difference between a determined invasion attack and a heavy air raid. If, as is probable, this area is selected by theGermans as a suitable place to land, the people with their childrenwill be bluntly faced with the choice either of being burnt alive or shotor bayoneted by the Germans, or, alternatively, of &quot; taking to the&quot; 1 -&quot; roads.&quot;    ; - - ^     - , , -(v) The only roads they can take are precisely the roads which our armouredand mobile reserves must use.   Any delay in their movement might: easily jeopardize the entire success of operations in South-east england. The Germans are fully alive to this. They know from the battle of France that British troops will not (and cannot be made to)drive ruthlessly over women and children. They may thereforedeliberately try. to create a large refugee movement and drive the civilians in front of them as a shield to their attacking troops.(vi) It has always been considered of the greatest importance that theBrighton group of towns should be evacuated when invasion was imminent. It is even more essential now as an invasion, if attempted,would be carried out on the most highly organised plans, with airbornetroops, landing craft of every description, A.A. craft and smoke-producing units. The scale of the attack in 1942 or 1943 will be much better prepared and much more formidable in every way than in1940 or 1941.(vii) Neither the Navy nor the Air Force can ensure that an invasion willnot be attempted, or that it will fail if it is attempted. They cannotensure that armed forces will not succeed in getting ashore in strengthand advancing into the country. So long as the risk remains it isnecessary to plan for invasion. The social repercussions of the com-pulsory evacuation scheme are fully realised, but it is pointed outthat the scheme will only be put into force when it appears almost certain that an invasion will be attempted. Until that time there willbe no disturbance to civil life. But if and when a full-scale invasionappears imminent the size of the population in the Brighton group and the extreme vulnerability of the area make it essential that theevacuation scheme should be applied.   To neglect to do so in the light, of all recent experience would be a risk which it is utterly unjustifiableto take, bearing in mind the issues at stake.13. From the point of view of the Ministers responsible for the civil aspectsof the compulsory evacuation scheme there are the following serious disadvan-tages to any scheme for the evacuation of the Brighton group of towns :- (a) There is a great difference between the removal of the comparatively small populations from each of the thirty-one towns to widely distributed reception areas and the removal from the Brighton neigh-bourhood of a population of 300,000, the majority of whom (some200,000) come from the twin towns of Brighton and Hove. against this must no doubt be set the military objection that the larger thetown the greater the risk of large refugee movements.(b) The evacuees must necessarily be accommodated in London, and, sincethe outer ring of London is already scheduled to receive 200,000persons of the half-million to be removed from the other thirty-one: towns, the Brighton evacuees must necessarily be taken into central london, which, at the time of the movement, may be under heavy air attack.   A map illustrating the position in London is attached.*(c) The influx of a further 300,000 people in the London area at such a time will raise difficult problems of supply and will throw a heavy burden on the various services and shelters, while it may well have an effecton public morale. It will be practically impossible to - provideeducational facilities in London for the Brighton children.     The.      evacuees from Brighton may be unwilling to stay in London under. .   raiding conditions and may add to any tendency to refugee movementsfrom London itself.  The Commissioner of Police is gravely concerned about the questions of public order which may arise., - J&apos;&apos;&apos;J........v&apos;i ,!&apos;&apos; r&apos;;J: r&apos; &quot;&quot;;- i* At the end of Appendix 1.
, (d) We have.examined the possibility of using other reception areas.   This, is impracticable for two reasons :        v,!   &apos; (i) it would not be possible to transport this large number in &amp; reason-&apos; able time to any other place:   Even their transport to London- &apos;&apos;;1 will only be possible by ah intensive use of the Southern electricrailway;(ii) such a large number could only be accommodated in large pro-vincial centres such as Birmingham or; in a large number ofscattered areas. In either case, the transport difficulties in theway of a speedy move would be insoluble..(e) Children and their mothers from Brighton and the other coastal townsaccommodated in London would be encouraged to volunteer for re-evacuation under the London evacuation scheme. This process would,however, be gradual and the Brighton children could not be givenpreference over London children who would be registering for evacua-tion at the same time. Moreover, it is very doubtful whether the rail-ways could handle this additional traffic to any material extent, at atime when their passenger facilities would be contracting.(/) The working out of a scheme for the Brighton group of towns involves the complete knowledge locally of the existence of the plan and very-wide knowledge in the reception areas. The compulsory evacuationscheme already covers 500,000 persons. If it is to cover a further300,000, the risk, always present, that the existence of the compulsoryevacuation scheme may seriously detract from the hold which the&quot;stand firm&quot; policy has in the public mind is greatly enhanced.Once the idea becomes general that towns threatened by the enemyare to be evacuated, the validity of the &apos;&apos; stand firm &apos;&apos; policy in otherparts of the country may be widely questioned.14. On the other hand, we think it right to mention that the Minister ofFood has pointed out that the evacuation of Brighton, by removing thedanger of possible refugee movements into the hinterland of the Brightontowns, would relieve the local authorities and himself of a serious problem at atime when military operations were in progress. Moreover, it is understood that,from a local police point of view, while the inhabitants of Brighton are not con-si dered to be specially liable to panic, the fact that it is impossible to provideshelter for all the inhabitants might lead to a difficult situation in the Brightontowns in the event of heavy bombing and fires followed by invasion. ;15. As we have been unable to reach a unanimous conclusion we considerthat the War Cabinet should be asked to decide whether the military advantages which would accrue from the compulsory evacuation of the Brighton group of towns outweigh the serious disadvantages from the civil point of view.16. If it is decided that the possibility of evacuating Brighton must be faced,we recommend that a scheme should be prepared forthwith. We would wish topress, however, that, when the time comes to consider whether the scheme shouldbe put into operation, the question whether the Brighton towns are to be evacuatedshould be specially considered in the light of conditions at the time.      &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;Conclusions.17.   Our conclusions may be summarised as follows : (i) We recommend that plans for the evacuation of the 31 towns should beIramedjOn the basis that the War Cabinet will be asked to Authoriseevacuation tobegin21 days before the enemy&apos;s preparations for invasionare likely to be completed, it being understood! that the Cabinet will,      take ^decision, whether to authorise eyacuation, in the light of all the; relevant considerations at the time. &apos;(ii) We remit for decision by the War Cabinet the question whether themilitary advantages of the evacuation on threat of invasion of theBrighton group of towns outweigh the serious disadvantages from thecivil point of view. /&apos;KI\     &apos; &apos; :&apos;&apos;
Home Office,February 12, 1942(iii) If it is decided that military considerations must prevail, then we recom-mend that a scheme of evacuation for these towns should be framedforthwith, but that when the time comes to consider whether com-pulsory evacuation should be effected, the need for putting into forceeach section (e.g., the Brighton group of towns) should receive separateexamination.




[H.D. (42) 1 (Final).January 21, 1942.]Home Defence Committee.MODIFICATION OF COMPULSORY EVACUATION SCHEME.Report.AT their meeting on the 16th December* the Chiefs of Staff referred, forour consideration, certain modifications of the compulsory evacuation schemes which the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, had put forward as a result of decisions made by the Prime Minister. (These are set out in an exchange of minutes between the Prime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal which will befound at Annex I.)   The Commander-in-Chiefs proposals were (a) That the towns of Brighton, Hove, Shoreham, Portslade, Southwick,Worthing and Littlehampton should be included in the compulsoryevacuation scheme on grounds of military necessity;(b) That the compulsory evacuation of all the towns in the scheme shouldbe begun 15 days before the estimated zero day for the completionof tlhe enemy&apos;s preparations for invasion and should proceeduninterruptedly on the assumption that the movement would becompleted by zero minus 5 days.2. It may be helpful at this stage to recite briefly the history of the compulsory evacuation scheme to show how the present situation has been reached.Plans already exist, for the compulsory evacuation of the 27 coastal towns in east Anglia, Kent and Sussex from Great Yarmouth to Newhaven and also for the inland towns of Ipswich, Colchester, Canterbury and Ashford (making31 in all). These plans can be carried out either as a single operation or in two stages, the first (Stage A) consisting of the compulsory evacuation of school-children and voluntary evacuation of mothers and young children, and thesecond (Stage B) covering the rest of the civilian population (except those requiredto remain to assist the military). The operation of the plans requires Cabinetsanction and it was understood that, while the sanction to Stage A might begiven at an early phase in the enemy&apos;s preparations, sanction to Stage B (or tothe whole plan as a single operation) would only be given when it became apparent that he intended to strike. The military authorities felt that in thesecircumstances it might be impossible to complete the operation before bombing of communications occurred on a heavy scale and they therefore proposed thatthe towns should be placed in two categories of priority, the first categoryincluding the towns of Canterbury, Ashford, Dover, Folkestone, New Romney,Lydd and Rye, and the second, the remainder of the so-called 31 towns. they proposed that the first class should be evacuated at a stage when the regional commissioner and the Army Commander jointly judged it to be necessary andtihe remainder at a later stage.3. While this proposal was under consideration, the Prime Minister raised the general question of the compulsory evacuation of the vulnerable coasts and,in a minute to the Lord Privy Seal, directed that plans should be prepared forthe evacuation of civilians from the coastal belt from the Wash to the Isle of wight and from certain inland nodal points. He desired that this scheme shouldbe put into operation in successive pre-arranged stages from the moment whenthe invasion emergency period was instituted; these stages might be betweenzero day minus 21 days and a shorter date. The Lord Privy Seal, in his reply,pointed out that arrangements were in force under which the greater part of thearea in question would be evacuated when Cabinet authority was given and took the view that the major question on which a decision was needed was the timing of tihe operation. He recommended that the Cabinet should accept &quot; the principlethat on being satisfied that a particular day is zero day,       the day on which* C.O.S. (41) 424th&apos;Meeting, Minute
invasion preparations will have been completed, the Government should thereuponorder the evacuation of the key towns&quot; (referred to in paragraph 2 above) &quot;atzero minus 21 days or zero minus 14 days and the. evacuation of other towns atzero minus X days according to plan. This would remove from them the fear that they would be left to decide almost in a period of 48 hours on a hurriedevacuation or a stand-still policy.&quot;  The Prime Minister approved this procedure.4. The existing plans were then re-considered by Home Forces and the civil departments concerned in the light of this decision and the conclusion wasreached that, as the new timing arrangements had altered radically the militaryview previously held of the practicability of the plans, it was no longer necessaryto divide the towns into categories, which was also undesirable from the civilianpoint of view. Under the new military proposal the plans for the 31 townswould be operated at a fixed date before the estimated zero date and completedwell before invasion preparations were completed. It was, however, consideredadvisable to provide as a reserve against unforeseen contingencies for thepossibility of evacuating children and mothers separately.5. As stated above, the two questions remaining for consideration are(a) the practicability of evacuating the 300,000 people included in the Brightongroup of towns, and (b) the time at which the plans should be operated in relationto the estimated zero date. For convenience we deal with the Brighton schemefirst.6. We were furnished by the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, with an appreciation of the question from the military point of view. This will befound at Annex II. The gist of this paper is that the presence of the civilian population in Brighton and the possibility of refugees blocking the few approachroads through the Downs.would be so great a handicap to our forces as to prejudice the chances of the successful defence of the country. Subject to thefootno.te* below, we accept the Commander-in-Chief&apos;s conclusion that it is a vitalmilitary necessity to remove the civil population (less essential personnel) fromthe Brighton group of towns, and we cannot but conclude that this must outweigh the social and political repercussions arising from the removal of some 300,000people.7. We feel bound, however, to deal with these disadvantages. They are setout in detail in a note by the Departments concerned, which will be found at annex III, together with a note by the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis.Apart from the complete interruption of the social and commercial life of a group of towns with a population of over a quarter of a million people, the mostserious disadvantage is that the only place to which the great majority of themcan be taken is Central London; a small proportion (some 20,000) can be placedin districts in Surrey, agreed with the Commander-in-Chief; but all other suitable reception areas have been earmarked for the thirty-one towns, and, in anycase, railway operating requirements render any other destination impracticable.The grave objections to this course from a civil point of view must not be under-estimated, for the problems of the Civil Defence Services and the police inpreserving public order in London at a time when it may be subject to heavierbombing than anything yet experienced are extremely serious. It is not proposedto provide for the advance evacuation of unaccompanied school children fromBrighton to Central London, but a Stage A could be provided consisting of the voluntary evacuation of children with their mothers.8. Although it is inevitable that the evacuees from Brighton must come toLondon in the first instance, we understand that it may be possible to.do some-thing to relieve the congestion there by encouraging the priority classes (children under 14 and women with young children) to volunteer to be re-evacuated from london on the same conditions as the priority classes in London at the present* The representatives of the Ministries of Home Security and Health feel they could not properly attempt to assess the correctness of the view set oui in paragraph 6 that the militaryestimate of the importance of evacuating the Brighton towns clearly outweighs the social andpolitical repercussions to which this step would give rise.These repercussions are set out in Annex III and their effect would undoubtedly be so serious that the recommendations in regard to these towns set out in paragraph 12 are, in their view, a matter for ministerial decision.
[23481]ctime. The possibility of this plan depends primarily on the ability of the railwaysto handle the additional traffic at a time when their passenger facilities will becontracting (certainly the movement must be complete before heavy bombing of communications begins). A secondary factor is the possible unwillingness of people who have reached a temporary resting place after leaving their homes toset but oh another journey. &apos; i M        v&apos; 9. The prospects of orderly adjustment of the evacuated populations wouldbe improved if the scheme could be put into operation not later than 21 days before zero, so that the whole move could be completed by zero minus 12 days. If, itis decided to include the Brighton group of towns, we think this change in thescheme should be made, though it is obvious, as pointed out in the memorandumby the civil departments, that the earlier evacuation is started the greater willbe the difficulty of convincing the public of its necessity and so securing theirwilling co-operation.10. It was pointed out to us that, if the Chiefs of Staffs estimate of theenemy&apos;s time-table is falsified by events and a period of some weeks occursbetween the removal of the coastal population and actual invasion, there maywell. be.a tendency to return. This, no doubt, could be controlled; but if nothinghappened for a considerable time, with the enemy crouched on the other sideready to spring, we are bound to recognise that discontent and criticism mightwell develop in the country and in Parliament. The point is dealt with in theLord Privy Seal&apos;s Minute at Annex I.11. The revised plans, if accepted, will take the place of the existingevacuation plans, and if for any reason the former are not completed well inadvance of zero, all the difficulties of the original scheme would arise and wouldbe intensified by the inclusion of Brighton. It is essential, therefore, that thereshould be no misunderstanding about the basis on which the plan which we havesuggested would operate. Zero day will be thirty days after the Chiefs of staff have reached the conclusion that preparations for invasion are so far advancedthat it could be launched at the end of a month. We understand that it is thePrime Ministers intention that the Cabinet should be asked to authorise the responsible authorities to put the new plan into operation twenty-one days before that zero date. If, however, before this is done the Chiefs of Staff have foundreason to alter their view of the date by which invasion is possible, the date onwhich the plans should be put into operation would be revised accordingly. if by mischance invasion occurred before the evacuation was complete, the operation would, of course, immediately come to an end. ;  *12. Our recommendations^ for giving effect to the Prime Minister&apos;s decisionare therefore as follows : [a) That the towns of Brighton, Hove, Shoreham, Portslade, Southwick-Worthing, and Littlehampton, should be incorporated in the com-pulsory evacuation scheme on the same basis as the existing 31 towns,i,e., that their whole population (less essential personnel) should be evacuated] in advance of invasion.:, (b) The authorities responsible for the evacuation operations should be!   1 assured that it is the intention to give authority to operate the wholeplan covering 38 towns 21 days before zero day for invasion as estimated by the Chiefs of Staff, and that the whole operation should proceed uninterruptedly until it is finished.(Signed) S.

Annex I. :oi(A) Prime Minister&apos;s Personal Minute, Serial No. C. 80/1.A scheme must be prepared for the evacuation of civilians from the coastal areas from the Wash to the Isle of Wight and also of Nodal Points likeColchester, Ipswich and Canterbury. This scheme will be put into operation in successive prearranged stages from the moment when the Invasion EmergencyPeriod is instituted. This might be between Zero minus 21 and a shorter :date.It is expected that the assembly of the shipping and Invasion craft in the fivermouths or their movement into the basins together with other symptoms will givesomething like this warning.2. The Lord Privy Seal will convene and preside over a small committeeof the essential high authorities in order that this scheme may be elaborated.Thereafter C.-in-C.

Sir Edward Bridges and General Ismay will arrange the Committee forthe approval of the Lord Privy Seal.W. S. C.October 10, 1941.(B) Copy of Minute dated October 14, 1941, from the Lord Privy Seal.Prime Minister.*7F TV &quot;7** &quot;Tt&quot; &apos;   - -I have discussed the point involved with Sir Findlater Stewart. It is nota matter for departmental action but for Cabinet decision. All arrangementsfor evacuation of invasion area towns have been made. The question at issueconcerns the timing of the operation.Military and civil authorities in the regions are concerned lest orders, for evacuation should be given too late. Ministers are concerned with the outcrywhich would arise should it be done too soon or on a false alarm.Last year the Cabinet stood firm against general evacuation, and eventsjustified their action.It is submitted that whereas last year&apos;s invasion would have been to someextent improvised, next year&apos;s will be very completely planned. The indications of this should, therefore, be more obvious. Some weeks&apos; notice of preparednessshould be available. While it would be possible for the beast to remain crouchedfor a considerable time ready to spring, evacuation should be put in hand somedays before he is actually ready.To evacuate considerable towns such as Ipswich, Colchester and Ashfordrequires a period of two or three days, the routes of the evacuees necessarily lieacross the lines of advance of our striking forces, hence they should be cleared intime.   Brighton would probably take a week.It would, I believe, set the minds of the Regional Commissioners and thesoldiers at rest if the Cabinet accepted the principle that, on being satisfied&apos; thata particular date is zero day, i.e., the day on which invasion preparations willhave been completed, the Government would thereupon order the evacuation ofthese key towns at, say, Zero - 21 days or Zero - 14 days and the evacuation of other towns at Zero - X days according to plan. This would remove from them the fear that they would be left to decide almost in a period of 48 hourson a hurried evacuation or a standstill policy.It necessarily leaves the obligation of accepting a particular day as Zero day with the Cabinet, which must stand the racket if the invasion does not come off.C. R. A.,Lord Privy Seal.Note.-The Prime Minister minuted this document &quot; So proceed.&quot;
Annex II.Compulsory Evacuation of Brighton Group of Towns.1. Area affected.(a) Towns of Brighton, Hove, Shoreham, Portslade, Southwick, Worthingand Littlehampton.(6) Number of persons to be evacuated from the above is approximately300,000, of whom the great majority must be accommodated in theLondon area; at least 260,000 would have to be put into central london unless accommodation is made available elsewhere.2. Vulnerability.(a) The sea passage from the coast of France to this area is short, and the route Northwards is the quickest means of approach to London, the distance from Brighton to Croydon being but 40 miles. Thearea is also within the enemy&apos;s fighter cover. It, therefore, constitutesone of the most vulnerable and dangerous areas in the country.(b) The beach between  Worthing and Bognor Regis is most suitablefor landing troops, wheeled and tracked vehicles at all states of thetide (12 miles). This stretch is therefore one of the most suitablefor an enemy landing.(c) Between   Brighton   and   Worthing   and   West   of   Bognor   Registroops, wheeled and tracked vehicles can be landed at certainstages of the tide. This stretch is therefore also suitable from theGerman point of view.(d) Immediately north of these towns lie the South Downs, which areone of the most dangerous places in the country from the pointof view of landing large numbers of parachute and airborne troops.Enemy troops so landed would be in a position to attack the beachdefences in this area from the rear, and to hold the line of the SouthDowns against our reinforcements coming from the north, thusaffording a very adequate bridgehead for the landing of further enemy forces.(e) It is as near certain as can be that the enemy will preface his attack by heavy bombing, causing fire on a large scale. Should this happen, thepeople may have no alternative but to evacuate on to the roads orperish in the flames, and the serious extent to which refugees canimpede military movement has already been proved. Should a very heavy concentration of gas be put down, it is improbable that the bulkof the people will survive to get on to the roads.if) The roads leading Northwards are few, and these pass through defilesin the South Downs. They are precisely the roads which our reserves coming down from the North and North West must use. It;is on these reserves that we rely mainly to repel invasion, and any delay imposed might have a disastrous effect on the result of the battle.(g) A successful enemy advance from the Brighton area due North on london would place the troops defending Kent in a dangerousposition, as the greater part of the roads and railways running west to East into Kent would be cut. It must be possible to restore thesituation in this area without hindrance and movement must NOT beparalysed by refugee traffic moving Northwards from the Brightonarea ahead of the enemy.(h) There is also the very real danger that the enemy would drive civiliansforward to shield their attacking troops, thus greatly embarrassingthe defenders.3- Conclusion.It is therefore considered a vital military necessity that the population (less essential personnel) shall be removed from the towns named before invasionstarts.G.H.Q., Home Forces,December 20, 1941.[23481]d





.... Annex III. .....Compulsory Evacuation of Brighton. i &apos;Memorandum by the Ministries of Home Security and Health.The ^question whether the Brighton Group of towns, with a peace-time population of 500,000 and a present population of 300,000^ shouldbe evacuated must depend primarily on military necessities. The JbSrighton-Group should riot be iricluded because of a belief that the inhabitantsfare &quot;unstable andl would be likely to &quot;run at the slightest provocation.The Civil Departments are riot satisfied that this is a fair description of&quot;the great majority of the inhabitants of the town. On the civilian side, the large&quot;riuiribers involved give rise to great difficulties. In the first place, unless asubstantial proportion were sent to the Birmingham area (which would give riseitotrarisport&quot; difficulties which might prove insuperable), no more than 30,000 tio&apos;4d,000 evacuees could be accommodated outside London, and then only if townssuch&quot;as Reigate, Dorking and Guildiford were used. Secondly, there are bbjec-tions to the &quot;removal of large numbers of evacuees to inner London under theconditions precedent to an invasion. It is conceivable, for instance, that&apos;theauthorities might have to operate the scheme at a time when inner london was the subject of intensive air attack whereas conditions at Brighton were com-paratively quiet. Further, the Commissioner of Police, who has been consulted,expresses concern about the problems of public order which may arise from the arrival in inner London of 300,000 refugees, in addition to the 200,000 going toouter London under the existing schemes. The General Officer Commanding-in-Chief London District, may also have views on this aspect of the matter.2. The inclusion of the Brighton Group would mean that not less than ten days ought to be allowed for the completion of the scheme.3. If it were decided to prepare a scheme for the evacuation of Brighton,there seems no need to plan for the separate evacuation of the Brighton children.It would be undesirable to take children separately into inner London at such atime.4.   To sum up, the views of the Civil Departments are as follows : That the aim should be to evacuate the thirty-one towns (i.e., the existingevacuation towns, excluding the Brighton Group) as one operation beginningat Z-15 days. (Z-21 if Brighton is included.) Even allowing for some dis-location the move should be completed before Z-7 (Z-12 if Brighton is in-cluded), i.e., before the worst dislocation due to bombing is likely.Extract from letter, dated November 6, 1941, received from Sir Philip Game.As Commissioner I feel : (a) that the introduction of half a million people into Greater London, justprior to our first experience of invasion for a thousand years, is a very doubtfullywise proposition, more especially as regards the 300,000 from the Brighton group of towns destined for Inner London. Many of them would not know the neigh-bourhood they found themselves in, nor its public communications, nor itsshopping facilities and a host of other kinds of local knowledge which preventone from feeling lost in London. They would almost certainly therefore be aconsiderable embarrassment to the Air Raid Wardens and would cause some addi-tion to the calls on the police.(&amp;) The children would offer a difficult problem, especially if separated fromtheir parents. They would need shelter in Central London and would either haveto be accommodated in the private shelters of their hosts, which might well be full, or in public shelters, where they would need someone to look after them, nota popular duty to those on whom they were compuisorily billeted.
On a wider basis I would suggest: (a) that if one is in the rifle butts one does not stand for safety in front of thebuh&quot;s eye!(b) that the disadvantages far outweigh any advantages;(c) that the evacuation of their children into Central London is not at alllikely to appeal to parents;(d) that apart from children many inhabitants of these South Coast towns-     , will feel a strong disinclination to coming into Central London,I agree with the summary in paragraph 4 of the memorandum, but would goa good deal further for, generally speaking. I am very doubtful of the wisdom ofany further evacuation. No one can know in advance when or where the blow will fall and evacuation may result in making matters worse instead of better. I feelreasonably certain that the wisest course, from a military and! every other pointof view, is to keep driving home beforehand the advice of &apos;&apos; carry on &apos;&apos; with yourjob till invasion comes a,nd &quot; stay, put &quot; once any invasion of any kind has actuallystarted. The few people who can&apos;t stick it out would not, I think, be a realembarrassment to military movement for I am confident we can, after the ex-periences of the last blitz, trust the great bulk of the population to stand up to whatever comes.
