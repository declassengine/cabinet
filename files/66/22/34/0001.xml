E. BRIDGES, *.Secretary of the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S. W. 1,February 28, 1942.ANNEX.Cypher Telegram from the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, to the WarOffice. (Despatched 1355 February 26, 1942; Received 2100 February 26,1942.)(C.S./760.   26/2.)FOLLOWING for Chiefs of Staff from Commanders-in-Chief. most secret: 1. At the time of departure of Mr. Oliver Lyttelton, when the question ofhis&apos; replacement will come up for consideration by the Prime Minister, weconsider it appropriate to.place on record our view regarding the necessity fora Minister of War Cabinet rank in the Middle East. .2.   We wish to represent that the Minister of State (a) Provides a link on the highest level with His Majesty&apos;s Government athome. In matters of both strategy and policy we regard this link asindispensable to the successful prosecution of the war in this theatre.(b) Provides guidance and advice, from the political and governmentalpoint of view, on questions of military policy, which in this theatregenerally affect all three services. In this respect the presence ofMr. Oliver Lyttelton as Chairman of the Defence Committee has beeninvaluable, in our opinion.[23518]-
2(c) Has relieved, us of, the responsibility, of dealing direct with the civil authorities in many countries comprised in this Command. Havingregard to the innumerable political and economic problems which arise in connection with Persia, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Egypt,the Sudan, North and East Africa, and the Arab world generally, towhich must be added problems which arise in our relations with the americans and numerous Allies, we think you will agree that it wouldbe impossible for us to cope with these and at the same time exerciseour primary functions as Commanders-in-Chief. We recall that itwas largely to relieve General Wavell and his colleagues of the burdenof these problems that the Minister of State was first appointed.(d) Finally, the office of the Minister of State has become a focus for theco-ordination of the views of the services and other authorities in theMiddle East. This enables concerted action to be taken and is to theadvantage of all concerned.3. To sum up. We are convinced that it is essential that there should bein the Middle East a Minister who has the confidence of the Minister at homeand who is a member of the War Cabinet, and that he should be served by anadequate staff qualified to deal with the many and varied political, financial,economic and propaganda problems which are. constantly arising in the middle east.4. The necessary machinery to perform the functions described in para-graph 2 above has been set up under the direction of Mr. Oliver Lyttelton. Wehere now understand how it works and how to work it. We submit that it wouldbe a great mistake to contemplate any change in the existing system, and we would urge the appointment of a new Minister of War Cabinet rank without delay.5. We request that this may be laid before the Minister of Defence for hisconsideration.6.   War Office pass to Admiralty and Air Ministry.
