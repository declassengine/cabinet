secret.P.  (42) 79&apos;w&quot;AR CA3IMBTAIR TRANSPORTMemorandum by the Minister of Information.I am glad that the Foreign Secretary lias brought the question of civilian air transport to the attention of the Cabinet.    If this questionis to be fully reconsidered the needs of propaganda, and of political warfare should also be taken into account.2.     The Ministry of Information has a great many posts throughout theneutral world and has found by experience that their work can only be properly co-ordinated and kept up to date by a frequent exchange of visits between local and headquarters staff.    The Ministry&apos;s best work has always been done in countries from which it has been ablesystematically to recall staff for consultation and for further training and to which it has been able to send senior officers, on missions from london.3.     The transport of personnel, however, cannot be considered apart from-the transport of material.    The Ministry of Information has.followed apolicy of producing as much as possible of its publicity materialabroad, but there remains a great deal that can only be sent from theUnited Kingdom in a finished state.    The work of its staff abroadnaturally depends upon receiving this with the utmost regularity.    I need,hardly emphasise the vital importance in publicity matters of speed andpromtitude in despatch.4*      I recognise with gratitude that in the past the Ministry has receiveda reasonable share of facilities for both material and personnel.    I should like to point out, however, that because of the transport difficultiesthe Ministry has from the start been deliberately modest in its demands,and that if it is to present the British case in neutral countries with thegreatest possible effectiveness, it cannot indefinitely subject itselfto this self-denying ordinance.   For months past it has been assailedwith complaints from such crucial posts abroad as Turkey against the delays with which its material is delivered.5.      I am well aware that for a long time to come no Department is likelyto obtain the optimum transport facilities that it would like, and thatthe allocation of the limited numbers of aircraft available must remain the responsibility of the Defence Committee.    That is the reason, however,why I feel obliged to call attention to the urgent needs of our propagandaservices, and&apos;why I think that even if the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposalfor an independent board is not pursued, a new survey of,the competing claims upon aircraft space should at once be undertaken.% B,34th February 1942
