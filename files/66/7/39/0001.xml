this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;S governmentTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MOST SECRET.W.P.C40) 159.18TB MAY. 1940,THE AIR DEFENCE OF GREAT BRITAIN,Report by the Chiefs ofStaff Cornmitteoe1. The chiefs of Staff  invite attentionto the attached letterx from the Commander-in-Chief,Fighter Command,    This letter raises the finalissue of a problem which must have been in the forefront of all our minds in the last few days, andwhich is of such vital importance to the security ofthis country and of the Empire that we have thought it right to put our views forward to the War Cabinet asa matter of urgency.2m In paragraph 4 of his letter Commander-in-Chief asks to he informed of the minimum vital strength which the Air Council consider might he retained forthe defence of this country.3, The calculations based on the strength of theGerman first line bomber strength before the warlead us to the conclusion that this minimum was 53squadrons with the necessary reserves to meet wastage..E^on   this was on the assumption that the bases forthe enemy attack would be confined to Germany, and the requirement has obviously increased, not only withthe occupation of Norway, but still more since theoccupation of Holland with the consequent increasedthreat to this country and to our naval bases and shipping in the narrow seas from short-range bombers and fighter escorts.4o       Our strength in this country has now been reducedto 37 squadronsc   Even these have already suffered losses in operations on the Continont and six of them are now-engaged in the battle in France operating from their homebases*   Our reserves of fully equipped fighters, moreover,are totally inadequate to meet tho very high rate of wastage now boen incurred in tho battle in Franco05,       Wo are, of course, agreed that oyon if the worseoccurs and our French Allies arc overwhelmed., Englandwill fight on.X Enclosure* ,COPY NO-IkWAR CABINET;

6. If this situation should arise we shall still hefaced with a very powerful   onemy bomber force that can be  escorted by fighters, with bases stretching over 1,000miles from Norway to the Western point of France.7. In the light of the foregoing consideration we canarrive at ho conclusion other than that we have already reached the absolute limit of the air assistance that Wecan afford to France,  if we are to have any channo of.protecting the United Kingdom, the Fleet, our sea-bornetrade, our aircraft industry, and all the vital centresthroughout the country on which we must depend for our ability to continue the war.8. This raises an issue which is grave to the lastdegree.      If we decline to send any further fighterassistance to France or to continue the support which weare now affording with these squadrons in England for more than a few days at a time at most, then it is notbeyond the bounds of possibility that the French Armymay give up the struggle.      If, on the other hand, we continue to accept this constant drain on the vitaldefences of this country in order to sustain french resistance, then a time will arrive when our ability todefend this country will disappear.9. We do not believe that to. throw in a few moresquadrons, whose loss might vitally weaken the fighterline at home, would make the difference between victoryand defeat in France.10.       We do not propose to enter in this note into the implications of a collapse of French resistance becausethat is the subject of a report which is now being producedas a matter of urgency by the Joint Planning Committee.It can, however, be said with absolute certainty thatwhile the collapse of France would not necessarily mean the ultimate victory of Germany, the collapse of GreatBritain would inevitably do so.(Signed)    C.L.N..NEWALL.&quot; DUDLEY POUND.&apos;!

19048.COPY OF A LETTER PROM THE.AIR OFFICERCOMMANDING IN CHIEF, FIGHTER CO.MI.IAND.TO THE UNDER SECRETARY OF STATE,AIR MINISTRY. &apos;Headquarters, Fighter Command,Royal Air Force, .Bentley Priory,Stanmore^Middlesex.Sir.I have the honour to refer to the very seriouscalls which have recently been made upon the Home Defence,.Fighter Units in an attempt to stem the German invasionon the Continent.2. .       I hope and believe that our Armies may yet bevictorious in France and Belgium, but we have to face the possibility that they may be defeated.3. .       In this case I presume that there is no-one whowill deny that England&quot; should fight on, even though theremainder of the Continent of Europe is dominated bythe Germans. ..4. .       For this purpose it is necessary to retain someminimum fighter strength in this country and I mustrequest.that the Air Council will inform me what theyconsider this minimum strength to be, in order thatI may make my dispositions accordingly.5. I would remind the Air Council that the lastestimate which they made as to the force necessary todefend this country was 52 Squadrons, and my strengthhas now been reduced to the equivalent of 36 squadrons.6. -       Once a decision has been reached as to the limit on which the Air Council and Cabinet are prepared to stakethe existence of the country, it should be made clear tothe Allied Commanders on the Continent that not a singleaeroplanes from Fighter Command beyond the limit will besent across the Channel, no matter how desperate thesituation may become,7.,       It will, of course, be remembered that the estimateof 52 Squadrons was based on the assumption that the attack would come from the eastwards except in so far as the defencesmight be outflanked in flight., We have now to face thepossibility that attacks may come from Spain or even from theNorth coast of France... The result is that our line is verymuch extended at the same time as our resources are reduced,8. I must point out that within the last few days the equivalent of 10 Squadrons have been sent to France, that theHurricane Squadrons remaining in this country are seriouslydepleted,.. and that the more squadrons which are sent toFrance the higher will be the wastage and the more insistentthe demands for reinforcements.The Under Secretary of State,Air Ministry,LONDON, WfcC.2.

^.       I must therefore request that as a matter of paramount urgency the Air Ministry will consider and decide what level of strength is to he left to cheFighter Command for the defence of this countryjand will assure me that when this level has hetin reached,not one fighter will he sent across the Channel howeverurgent and insistent the appeals for help may be.10.     I believe,that if an adequate fighter force is kept in this country, if the Fleet remains in being, andif Home Forces are suitably organised to resistinvasion, we should be able to carry on the war singlehanded for some time, if not indefinitely.     But,if the Home Defence Force is drained away indesperate attempts to remedy the situation in France,defeat in France will involve the final, complete andirremediable defeat of this country.I have the honour to be.Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Signed)    H^CoT.
