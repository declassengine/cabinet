(40) 314)May 3,1940TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 35)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon April 25th to12 noon May 2nd,1Q4 fl[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room.

General Review.NAVAL operations have continued to be largely concerned with the supportof our forces in Norway.Steps have been taken to strengthen our position in the Mediterranean againstthe possibility of Italian hostility by reinforcing our naval forces, and diversion of shipping.German minelaying by aircraft on the East Coast has increased.Northern Waters.2. Naval operations off the Norwegian Coast have continued without inter-mission throughout the week under review.   These have consisted mainly of : (a) Operations for re-capture of Narvik.(b) Escort of troop and store convoys.(c) The provision of air support, and anti-aircraft defence in the Aalesundand Namsos areas.(d) The evacuation of troops from Aandalsnes and Moide.Narvik Area.8. During the first days of the period under review, deep snow and adverse weather conditions prevented operations on shore to displace the Germansoccupying Narvik.H.M. Ships were employed controlling communications by sea anddestroying railway communications with Narvik town; and preparations werepushed forward to deliver an attack as soon as weather conditions should permit, ,ships establishing themselves on both sides of Ofot Fjord, and in other selectedpositions. Arrangements have also been made for the storage of stocks of fuel and ammunition, but large-scale administrative planning will be necessary beforeeither harbour or town can be of use to us.H.M.S. Resolution arrived in this area on the 25th April to take the placeof H.M.S. Warspite, who returned to the United Kingdom. H.M.S. Furiousalso sailed for the United Kingdom the same day.4. On the 27th and 28th April ineffective air attacks from a great altitudewere carried out against H.M. Ships Effingham, Southampton and Aurora. a french convoy arrived with Chasseurs and artillery on the 27th. On the 1st may the Grand Hotel, Harstad, the Naval Base Headquarters, was bombed, 2 ratingsbeing killed. Three bombs fell close to the Hospital Ship Atlantis, though shewas lying quite apart.The Fleet oiler Boardella went a,ground off Lango Island (Lofoten Islands)on the evening of the 30th April on her way to Vaags Fjord; she subsequentlycaught fire and sunk, without casualties.   Three supply ships arrived.On the 28th April a thaw set in, and on the 1st May it was anticipated that operations against Narvik would commence.   No news is available, however.Namsos Area.5. Frequent enemy air attacks have been carried out in this area. Here, asin the Aandalsnes area, the dominating factor has been the enemy air superiority.Disembarkation operations have been hampered by the fact that no more than two ships could be unloaded at a time : by the 28th April, owing to damage bybombs only the stone pier remained, which is capable of berthing small ships only.A French convoy consisting of two ships with motor transport, and the CapBlanc with stores, arrived in the evening of the 26th : the two former were clearedthat night, but the Cap Blanc after standing off for a couple of days, sailed on the28th for the United Kingdom without unloading.S.S. Chrobry landed some Headquarters Officers, ambulance units, and fourRoyal Marine Howitzers on the 27th leaving for the United Kingdom next morning : and S.S. Gunvor Maersk arrived on the evening of the 28th and landedBof ors guns and ammunition.
6. Two trawlers were bombed on the 29th : the Aston Villa alongside the&apos;pier near Hon, without casualties, and the Gaul, which received a hit and wentashore.During the 30th, H.M. Sloop Bittern was bombed continuously. She shot down one aircraft. In the afternoon a dive-bombing attack was carried out by8 Heinkels, which set her on fire. She was abandoned, and sunk in deep water,survivors being picked up by H.M.S. Carlisle, who was herself bombed (without being hit) on the 1st May. The evacuation of this area, which had been planned for the night of the lst-2nd May, had to be postponed owing to fog : information has just been received that this operation was successfully carried out during the night of the 2nd-3rd May. 6,400 troops being taken off.Aaiesund Area.7. - Heavy enemy bombing attacks have been of daily occurrence in this area.On 26th April a German minelaying trawler under Dutch Colours rammedH.M.S. Arrow off Aandalsnes. The Arrow was damaged and proceeded to the shetlands, the trawler being sunk by H.M.S. Birmingham- Later on the same day, a second German trawler similarly disguised, which proved to be a submarinedepot ship, was captured by H.M.S. Griffin and sent to Scapa. She contained2 torpedo tubes loaded, 4 magnetic mines, 2 field guns, a concealed gun, anti-aircraft ammunition^ depth charges and explosive stores.8. H.M. Ships Manchester, Birmingham and York disembarked GeneralPaget, Staff and 2,000 troops at Molde on the night of the 25th-26th.On the 25th H.M. Anti-Submarine Trawlers Hammond and Bradman, andthe Norwegian destroyer Trygg were bombed and sunk off Aandalsnes; and onthis and subsequent days, severe damage was inflicted on the port area, includingthe western wooden jetty and store houses, with considerable loss of small arms,ammunition and explosives.HM.S. Flamingo, having expended all her high-angle ammunition, left forthe United Kingdom on the 26th April, being relieved by H.M.S. Black Swan.9. By the 27th April the damage inflicted at Aandalsnes was such that theport was deemed to be no longer capable of providing the necessary scale ofsupply. Minor damage only was suffered by H.M. Ships, but all their high-angleammunition was expended; four, possibly five, enemy aircraft were brought down. One ship of a convoy landed motor transport and stores during the night of the 27th to 28th, though heavily bombed, without being damaged, whileapproaching the area; the remainder did not unload and returned to the UnitedKingdom.On the 28th April the air attacks on Aandalsnes continued. TIM, ShipsA shanti, Nubian and Black Swan were damaged; the latter was hit by a bombwhich passed through her without exploding, and she has returned to the UnitedKingdom. Two more Anti-Submarine Trawlers were lost. The Cape Siretokowas sunk and the Wistaria driven ashore, one aircraft being shot down by CapeSiretoko.H.M.S. Diana sailed for Tromso with the Norwegian Military Commander-in-chief and 30 of his staff.H.M.S. Fleetwood sailed from Aandalsnes with 340 men (includingcasualties), having expended practically all her ammunition, on the evening ofthe 29th, and none of H.M. Ships was at Aandalsnes until the arrival ofHM.S. Auckland on the evening of the 30th.10. Early on the 30th April H.M.S. Glasgow, having embarked H.M. theKing of Norway, the Crown Prince and members of the Government, left Moldeescorted by 2 destroyers. The Royal party transferred to the NorwegianS.S. Heindal on the evening of the 1st in Malanjer Fjord (north-east of VaagsFjord) and proceeded to the vicinity of Tromso. H.M.S. Glasgow sailed early on the 2nd for the United Kingdom, with the Norwegian Ministers of defence and Foreign Affairs, the British Minister to Norway, and 60 per cent, of thebullion from Aandalsnes on board.11. The evacuation of 2.200 British troops.and 120 Royal Marines fromAandalsnes was successfully carried out by H.M. Ships Galatea, Aretlwsa,,Sheffield and Southampton, 4 destroyers and 1 transport under the Flag Officer
Commanding 2nd Cruiser Squadron on the night of the 30th April-lst May. Noguns could be embarked. ,At the same time Captain (D) 6, in Somali, with  destroyers and a transport evacuated about 150 troops from Molde.During this night H.M.S. Wanderer went ashore near Aandalsnes, but wastowed off by H.M.S. Sikh, and, though damaged, can steam at 25 knots.Bombing attacks continued during the 1st May, and H.M. Ships Calcuttaand Auckland had 150 bombs aimed at them without being hit.The evacuation of Aandalsnes and Molde was completed the following night(the lst^2nd May), all the remaining troops being taken off by H.M. ShipsManchester, Somali and Auckland.Operations of Fleet Air Arm.12. H.M. Ships Ark Royal and Glorious have been operating to the North-West of Trondheim. On the 25th April, twelve Skuas supported the militaryin the Aandalsnes Area to a distance of 90 miles from the Coast, shooting downone Heinkel and damaging another.   Several Junker bombers were driven off.An intermittent patrol over Namsos was carried out, in the course of which enemy bombers and float planes were engaged : General Carton de &quot;Wiart statedthat the air superiority obtained on this day was very valuable.During the forenoon of the 25th, 33 aircraft carried out an attack in theTrondheim area. Three large hangars at Varnes were destroyed, and two bombers and several buildings were damaged. Nine seaplanes were caught at theirmoorings, and attacked successfully with bombs and machine guns. AtThamshaven (15 miles to the westward of Trondheim) 2 oilers were set on fire,and 2 ships alongside, besides 2 transports, were attacked. One merchant ship was probably sunk, and a warehouse was hit.Six Skuas and five Swordfish aircraft were lost in these operations butonly four crews are missing.13. On the 28th April another raid was carried out over Trondheim inthe early morning. All hangars at Varnes were destroyed, besides severalaircraft. Fifteen flying-boats and seaplanes at moorings were bombed with good results.   One Skua was lost.The Vice-Admiral Commanding aircraft carriers, reports that no fighteropposition whatever was encountered by this daylight attack, and that the german aircraft consistently avoid giving battle, even to inferior forces.H.M.S. Glorious returned to Scapa to fuel on the 28th, H.M.S. Ark Royalproceeding to the North-Westward to rest her air personnel. During this passage,she was heavily attacked by enemy bombers (one of which she shot down),without receiving damage.Skuas shot down 4 Heinkels and damaged 5 others during the day.H.M.S. Glorious later rejoined Ark Royal, and both carriers proceeded toa position to the North-West of Trondheim. On the 1st May, Ark Royal was heavily bombed, and shot down one enemy aircraft: as the Vice-Admiral reportedthat he could not operate near enough to the shore to support the troops, theCommander-in-Chief ordered this force to return to Scapa.Operations of British Submarines.14. Submarines in the Eastern Skaggerak and Kattegat have been working under conditions of extreme difficulty. They report anti-submarine patrolsmaintained by the enemy to be extremely numerous, and that air patrols by day and by night are continuous. The moonlight nights and parachute flares dropped by the enemy rendered the operation of charging batteries precarious; and their difficulties in attack have been enhanced by calm and clear weather conditions,which are ideal for listening and observation by the enemy anti-submarine forces!H.M.S. Sterlet is overdue and must be considered lost.On the 27th April submarines were withdrawn from the Skaggerak until thenext dark-night period.15. Further reports of activities during the previous week have beenreceived from submarines on return to their bases. H.M.S. Seawolf sunk2 transports or store ships of about 4,000 tons each on the 18th April, and fromthe manner in which one burnt she is believed to have been a tanker.
H.M.S. Tetrarch attacked a large south-bound convoy of about 15,000 tons onthe 23rd April. She was then hunted and forced to remain submerged for43 hours at a depth of 400 feet.H.M.S. Narwhal attacked a convoy in the Kattegat on the 1st May, andpossibly obtained a hit.Home Waters.16. The Northern patrol between Greenland and Iceland, and Iceland andthe Faroes, has been maintained by armed merchant cruisers.On the 30th April H.M. Minesweeper Dwnoon was mined and sunkabout 15 miles to the eastward of Great Yarmouth. There were 42 survivors,4 seriously wounded.On the same day an internal explosion occurred in the French destroyerMaille Breze, who was at Greenock (Clyde) waiting to escort a convoy. Therewere about 50 casualties.   The Maille Breze has since sunk.H.M. Submarine Unity collided with the Norwegian s.s. A tie Jam in lowvisibility in the evening of the 29th April off the Farn Islands (Northumberland),and sank in deep water. One officer and four ratings are missing. Tappingwas heard from the hull on the 30th April; diving operations were attemptedunsuccessfully.S.S. Franconia, on passage from Norway to the Clyde, was attacked by a submarine 75 miles to the northward of Cape &quot;Wrath.  She escaped unhurt.Foreign Waters.17. In view of the uncertainty as to the intentions of Italy both British andFrench Naval Forces in the Mediterranean have been strengthened, and theMediterranean has been closed to British merchant shipping. The forces stationed at Aden have also been reinforced. In this connection it is worthy ofnote that a great deal of Italian shipping is on the high seas, and much of it(including the 51,000-ton liner Reco), is outward bound on voyages begun duringthe last few days.German- Attack on Seaborne Trade.18. . Three British ships, totalling 4,720 tons, have been sunk by mine duringthe period; all of these casualties occurred in the Thames Approaches. No otherlosses have been reported, but two ships were damaged by submarine attack.Details are given in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.19. A total of 695 ships, of which 75 were Allied and 56 neutral, were convoyed during the week. One British ship in convoy was mined and sunk.Since the start of the war 15,132 British, 1,054 Allied, and 2,912 neutral ships have been convoyed, of which 31 only have been sunk, or 1 in 616. One battleship,7 armed merchant cruisers, 22 destroyers and. 15 sloops, in addition to Frenchdestroyers and submarines have been employed on convoy escort duties duringthe week under review.20. Imports to Great Britain during the week ending the 27th Apriltotalled 877,660 tons compared with 888,509 tons during the previous week. Thisslight decrease is remarkable considering the fact that merchant ship convoysbetween Great Britain and Norway have been suspended owing to the operations on the Norwegian coast. Oil imports in 25 tankers totalled 169,961 tons, ofwhich 24,500 tons were for France. Minerals were 169,961 tons compared with286,237 tons during the previous seven days, this decrease being largely due tothe cessation of the iron-ore trade through Narvik.
Anti-Submarine Operations.21. Five attacks by surface craft have been made during the period and oneof these, made by H.M. ships Imogen and Ilex north of the Shetlands on the27th April, is considered promising.Two bombing attacks have been made by aircraft, and a hit with a 100-lb.bomb on the bow of a U-boat north-west of Cape Wrath was reported on the29th April.German Minelaying,22. There were no German minelaying air raids over the Thames Estuaryand the Downs during the week under review until the nights of the 30th April/1st May and the lst/2nd May. Although these two nights were dark, enemy aircraft were active off the East and South-Eastern coasts. On the 1st May the tyne and Harwich were closed, and after the raid on the following night(lst/2nd May) all ports from Blyth to the Humber were also closed to shipping.At Blyth a German aircraft flew round the South Harbour machine-gunning.Dunkirk has also been closed, but it was hoped that traffic there would be resumed on the 2nd May.Reports have been received during the week of German mine fields off thecoast of Norway across the entrance to Trondheim Fjord and off Skudesnes inthe approaches to Stavanger.  A dangerous area has been declared off Skudesnes.British Minesweeping.23. Minesweeping has been carried out near Smith&apos;s Knoll, east of GreatYarmouth, where the British Cree was mined on the 26th April, and mines havebeen found, though the number is not yet known. Anti-sweep devices were alsofound. It is desired to establish the western edge of the mine field, clear thearea within three miles of the War Channel, and then leave the remaining minesto form part of the Mine Barrier.   A dangerous area has been declared.The clearance of the area west of the East Coast War Channel betweenCoquet Island and Blyth has been continued, and four more fairly old Germantype X or Y mines have been cut. This area has now been cleared except theinshore strip.Skids have accounted for 5 magnetic mines during the week, 4 of them inthe Sunk area and 1 near the Shambles Light Vessel in Weymouth approaches.It is considered probable that the latter was laid with others about the15th September, and, if so, magnetic mines may still be active after seven and a half months.British Minelaying.24. In the current week mines were laid by destroyers in Trondheim Ledenon the 29th April and by H.M.S. Narwhal inside the Skaw on the 30th April andthe 2nd May.Minelaying by aircraft has continued in German South Baltic and north sea ports.German Merchant Shipping.25. It has been reported from Rotterdam that the Motor Ship Robert Ley(27,288 tons), which was used on the official &quot; Strength through Joy &quot; cruises,was sunk in the Skagerrak during the night of the 12th-13th April with850 troops on board.The M.V. Seattle (7,369 tons), which had reached Norway from Curacoa andsailed from Haugesund on the 7th April, has been reported by her owners as atotal loss.   She was probably sunk in the Skagerrak on the 8th April.The S.S. Sayn (2,321 tons) and an unknown German ship are reported tohave been sunk by mines off the Dutch uoast close to the German frontier.
German Intelligence.26. It is believed that the German mam units have been in their home portsduring the last week.A report from Bergen on the 29th mentions two destroyers in dry dock there,both of them camouflaged with sand and trees against air observation.Reports indicate that 4-5 transports are arriving at Oslo daily. In all, somefifty transports, a large hospital ship and several minesweepers and trawlers are believed to have been at Oslo on the 28th April. On the 25th April a largenumber of transports were stated to be concentrated in the Island of Bornholm.On the 1st May 3 enemy cruisers, an aircraft carrier and 3 destroyers were reported off the Ems Estuary by aircraft.The latest information available indicates that the following are the names of the German destroyers sunk in Narvik Harbour :- Erich Jiese, 1,625 tons. ..   -Anton Schmidt, 1,811 tons.Bernd von Arnim, 1,625 tons.Erich Koellner, 1,625 tons.Wilhelm Heidkamp, 1,811 tons.Bruno Heinemann, 1,625 tons.Most of these are ships completed since 1938.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.27.   There has been no change in the situation.Portions of the 12th, 23rd and 46th Divisions, which are to assist in workon the L. of C. in back areas, have now arrived in France.Germany.28. There do not appear to have been many important changes in theGerman dispositions on the Western Front. Numerous reports point to furthertroops being assembled in . (a) the Hungarian and Yugoslav frontier areas (Austria and the Protec-torate); and(&amp;) the Memel area.In the case of (a), the movement appears to have started early in April. Itis. reported that empty rolling-stock for pontoon equipment was sent to the rhineland early in April to bring bridging material to Austria.Information regarding (&amp;) is less precise, but several reports refer to the increasing number of troops at Memel and in East Prussia; on the other hand,sources differ regarding the presence at eastern Baltic ports of transports for thetroops in question.29. Since the beginning of the Scandinavian campaign there has been anincrease in reports of activity on fortification work on the Lithuanian andnorthern Russian frontiers and on the defences of the Baltic Coast.
30. The distribution of German divisions up to and including the 1st Mayis believed to be as follows :  Area.	Cav.	Armd.	lit.       Mot.		Inf.	Totals.Western Theatre Central Germany Scandinavia   ... Baltic Coast, including Corridor and East Prussia Poland, excluding Corridor ...

The 2nd Echelon of General Audet&apos;s light division has arrived.General Bethouart has taken over command of the French troops. Heavy fallsof snow continued during the early part of the week. One company Scots Guardsmoved to the Bodo area on the 30th April and the 2nd Battalion South WalesBorderers, with one ski group Chasseurs Alpins, are now established on theAnkenes peninsula, where they have captured a power station.The total number of German troops probably does not exceed 3,000 men.They are thought to be short of supplies; food and ammunition is being dropped by parachute. The railway from Narvik to Sweden is guarded by about 1,000Germans and all bridges and tunnels have been prepared for demolition.Namsos-Trondhjem Area.32. During the week patrols of General Carton de Wiart&apos;s force main-tained contact with the enemy on the front north of Steinkjer, and capturedsome prisoners. As reported in the naval section, the final withdrawal of allied troops from Namsos was completed in the early morning of the 3rd May. Detailsregarding the withdrawal are not yet available.Aandalsnes Area.33. During the week, enemy air forces have kept up heavy, systematicbombing attacks on the bases at Aandalsnes and Molde and also on the forward troops.Major-General Paget and the remainder of the 15th Infantry Brigadearrived at Aandalsnes on the night 25th-26th April.On the 25th April, a heavy attack, supported by medium artillery, low-flying aircraft and tanks, was launched on the 148th Irifantry Brigade. Sub-sequently, the 15th Infantry Brigade took over the front, occupying a defensiveposition at Kvam, whilst the two battalions of the 148th Infantry Brigade werereformed into one composite battalion. Attacks continued on the 26th Aprilon the 15th Infantry Brigade and were successfully repulsed with heavy losses to the enemy, including some medium tanks. The force withdrew during thenext few days, first to a position covering. Dombaas and ultimately tothe base at Aandalsnes, where it embarked for Scapa during thenights the 30th April-lst May and the lst-2nd May.During the whole operation our forces in this area were handicapped bylack of adequate air and artillery support. Attempts to establish a landing ground at Lesjeskog early in the week were unsuccessful. Although our fighterssucceeded in destroying some 14 enemy aircraft, they were bombed and put outof action the day after they arrived.
JJergen-Stavanger -Kristiansand South Area.34. The&apos;total&apos;number of German troops in the area is estimated at 18,000,with about 10,000 in Bergen and the vicinity. Operations inland based onBergen, Stavanger and Kristiansand are being pushed forward with air support.On the Bergen-Oslo railway German troops have advanced as far as Finse. TheVoss area and Gudvangen on Sogne Fjord are in German hands. From StavangerGerman troops have advanced some 30 miles south-east to Dirdal. The german advance inland from Kristiansand is believed to have passed beyond Evje.Oslo Area.35. The strength of troops operating in and based on the Oslo area andto the north is estimated at 75,000, though reports indicate that Oslo itself is empty of troops. Reinforcements are arriving by sea and air, Larvik beingthe main port of disembarkation. During the period the 13th-21st April,transports were reaching Oslo or Larvik at the rate of 6-10 per day. Themajority of the ships left from ports in the western Baltic; in these circumstancessea communications would not appear to be a serious limiting factor in the reinforcement of German troops in Norway.Norwegian Army.36. There is a tendency to regard the Norwegian troops as having failedto offer effective resistance; but it must be borne in mind that their peacetraining was inadequate and a high proportion of their equipment, which wasin any case out of date, fell into the hands of the Germans at the very beginning.Moreover, the speed of the German attack interfered with mobilisation andconcentration and must have caused considerable demoralisation. Although the norwegians have had no war experience for over a century, they have undoubtedlyfought well on several occasions. The tenacity shown by the defenders of Hegrafort being an outstanding example.It is still difficult to estimate the total Norwegian forces actually underarms, since reliable information is lacking of the numbers Avho have surrenderedor were unable to mobilise. The following appears to be the approximatesituation : Kirkenes-Tromso area : 3,000 men.Bardu-Narvik area : 5,000 men.Trondheim area : 3,500 men..   Bergen area : 10,000-15,000 were, at one time, reported to be concen-trating at Voss but are now retreating eastward.. Stavanger area : 2,000 men.Kristiansand South area : 2,000 men.Oslo area : The equivalent of a few battalions only now continue fighting.Italy.37. The degree of mobilisation in the Italian Army remains apparentlyunchanged. The most important fact bearing on mobilisation is that there arefive recently trained reservist classes on &quot;unlimited leave&quot; and these can becalled up at any time with a delay of only four to five days. In the autumn of1939 the Italians published certain figures of their fighting forces, the intentionpresumably being mainly to emphasise their strength and preparedness. Similarfigures have not yet been made public this Spring.There is nothing of importance to record in Italian overseas territories,which do not appear to have received any reinforcements during the week.U.S.S.R.38. The movement of Soviet formations from the Finnish front to their peace-time stations appears to be continuing. Some reinforcements may have beensent to Murmansk, but there is no evidence of any other significant troop con-concentrations. Reports that fortification work is being intensified in the Grodno-Bialystok area and also south of Przemysl, have been received.
AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.41. Operations to reduce enemy air superiority in Norway were continued.Weather conditions were unfavourable in the middle of the week, but a heavyscale of attack was maintained on enemy air bases, oil supplies and shipping,whenever possible.   The main targets and attacks are set out below.42. Hardanger Fjord and neighbouring Fjords were searched by sixBlenheim aircraft during the 25th April. Bombs were dropped on harbour works and on a railway station in Granvins Fjord, and on shipping at Ulvik; onemedium-sized transport was sunk, probably by air action, a^ad-^^malLeiajsampjxi^nt-was-aeejx-on shore,. One enemy fiying-boat was sunk and one seriously damaged by our bombers.   One of our aircraft failed to return.43. Oslo Fjord was searched by five Whitleys on the night of the 25th-26thApril. The oil tanks and refinery at Vallb and at Grisebii were heavily attacked with high explosive and incendiary bombs. Three fires were started and one ship of about 5,000 tons was also hit.  All aircraft returned safely.44. Fornebu A erodrome was attacked by five Whitleys on the night of the29th-30th April and bursts were seen on the aerodrome. Searchlight glare made it impossible to see whether there were enemy aircraft on the ground.   FurtherA most reliable and competent observer, who made a tour of Transcaucasiaand the Black Sea ports early in April, stated that he was permitted to travelwhere he pleased and that no abnormal, military activity was apparent. Somefortification work was in progress round Batum, but it did not appear to beextensive. There was evidence that the air defences of Baku had been reinforced by a number of small calibre guns, but otherwise there was little activity. Inthe opinion of the informant, there were no German troops or military techniciansin Transcaucasia, but five German oil experts had arrived in Baku since thebeginning of the year.Owing to the large number of men still mobilised, the spring sowing is seriously behindhand, the official estimate being that only 4 million hectares hadbeen sown by the middle of April against 12 million on the correspondingdate of last year. Although the long duration of the winter is partly responsible for this, the chief reason is the shortage of tractor drivers andmachines. The heavy and defence industries are still being fostered to the detriment of those which supply consumers. The food shortage is, in consequence,still severe and prices of certain food-stuffs have again risen. This hits peoplehard since there has been no corresponding increase of wages. The populationremains, however, sunk in its habitual apathy.East Africa.39. An additional battalion of the King&apos;s African Rifles has been raised in Uganda for internal security, thus freeing the existing Uganda battalion for service wherever required.Far East.40. The object of the Japanese operations in Shansi (North China) is tosecure the Yellow River crossings east of Pinglu, thus cutting the communica-tions of the considerable Chinese force occupying a salient running for about120 miles into Japanese-controlled territory north of the river. Should these operations succeed, the Japanese will be within measurable distance of attaining the original limited objective which they set themselves in July 1937.The continued activity shown by the Japanese-controlled Chinese forcesround Macao is due to a desire to maintain pressure on the Portuguese Govern-ment in order to secure a more favourable outcome of the negotiations, now inprogress, for Japanese concessions in the island of Timor in the East Indies.
attacks were made on the following night by five Hampdens and nine Whitleys,and by five Whitleys on the night of the lst-2nd May. Hits were obtained onhangars and many fires were started. One aircraft failed to return from thefirst raid.45. Aalborg Aerodrome was reconnoitred early in the week by severalaircraft, one of which was lost. The aerodrome was successfully attacked byone Hampden on the night of the 30th April/1st May, and by five Hampdenson the night of lst/2nd May. Hits were secured on anti-aircraft positions and fires were started, all aircraft returning safely.46. Rye Aerodrome, in Northern Denmark, was successfully reconnoitredon the 30th April, and good photographs were obtained which show about fiftyenemy aircraft, bombers and transports, parked on the landing-ground or con-concealed round the perimeter.47.   Stavanger was repeatedly attacked with considerable success as follows.During the night the 25th&apos;/26th April three Wellingtons bombed the aerodrome, the seaplane base and shipping in the fjord. Fires were startedamong the seaplanes and several ships are believed to have been hit. Thefollowing day a formation of twelve Blenheims was despatched, but had to be recalled on account of weather conditions.On the 30th April six Blenheims raided the aerodrome in the evening, and made high-level bombing attacks. About 150 enemy aircraft were seen on theground and enemy fighters were active. During the night the 30th April/lst may the attack was renewed by twelve Wellingtons and ten Whitleys. Enemy fighters were again encountered, and there was a balloon barrage at about 6,000 feet.On the 1st May daylight raids were made by formations of six and fourBlenheims. There was no opposition; very large numbers of enemy aircraft were seen parked on the aerodrome and round its edge, and were successfully attacked.Six&quot; Whitleys repeated the attack with success during the night of thelst/2nd May, and on the following morning a further raid was carried out by six Blenheims.Six of our aircraft were lost during these attacks, and two Messerschmitt 109were shot down.,o      *.48. JK^etrrre-^patrols 4x*f the German Coast and of German seaplanebases was maintained by twenty-seven Hampdens on the night of the25th-26th April, and by nine Hampdens on the lst-2nd May, with considerable success. Some opposition by fighters and light anti-aircraft fire was experiencedand three aircraft were lost. Valuable observations of shipping movements weremade, and one enemy seaplane was shot down. Meteorological reconnaissanceshave also been maintained off the Norwegian Coast.Coastal Command.49. In addition to normal operations, assistance was rendered to bomber command in reducing enemy air superiority in Norway. The Norwegiancampaign has continued to require new developments in the work of the Command.Sunderland aircraft have been used on several occasions to transport officers and stores to and from Namsos and Aandalsnes, and to bring home wounded, and haveaccomplished their tasks successfully. One of these aircraft reached the BomsdalsFjord on the 27th April after avoiding attack by three Junkers 88, was severelybombed on the water by twelve more Junkers, and was forced eventually to takeoff; in the air it was attacked by a Messerschmitt 110, which it shot down.Offensive patrols have also been maintained in the Aandalsnes area by relays ofBlenheims and Hudsons, with considerable success. On the 25th April oneHeinkel 111 was pursued and shot down by a section of Blenheims, and on thesame day two Messerschmitt 110&apos;s and a Messerschmitt 109 were sighted byHudsons off the Norwegian coast, but made no attempt to attack our aircraft.On the 29th April offensive patrols were maintained by twelve Blenheim fighters,which attacked and damaged a Heinkel 111, a Junkers 88 and a Messerschmitt110; four more enemy aircraft were attacked. One of our Blenheims crossed theNorth Sea on one engine on its return flight, and crashed on landing in the shetlands, without loss of life. On the 1st May these patrols were resumed by three Blenheims, which engaged two enemy bombers.
50. Attacks were carried out by Hudsons on shipping at Bergen on the29th April, and on Stavanger aerodrome on the 1st May. One grey-paintedmerchant vessel was probably damaged by a near miss off Bergen; many vessels were observed in the harbour, two of which appeared to be on fire, and hits weresecured on the Stavanger runways.   One aircraft failed to return.51. Seven submarines were sighted during the week, four of which werein the Shetland area, one off the Norwegian coast, and two off the Frisian coast.Two were attacked with bombs, one being narrowly missed and one hit on thebow with a 100-lb. bomb; air bubbles rose after the attack, but the sea wasrough and no wreckage or further evidence of damage could be seen. One othersubmarine was machine-gunned by an aircraft which had no bombs left. Twoof those seen off the Shetlands were sighted by aircraft with convoys, and one ofthem was machine-gunned and forced to dive as it was about to attack a destroyer.52. On the 1st May enemy warships and merchant vessels were reportedoff the Ems Estuary and Wangeroog as described in the Naval Situation. Onthe morning of the 2nd May this area was again reconnoitred and a Hudsonsighted a 10,000-ton enemy vessel 17 miles N.W. of Borkum. The same vessel was again seen two hours later further North. On both occasions bombs were dropped but no result was observed.Fighter Command.53. As reported last week, eighteen Gladiators were landed from an aircraft-carrier on the frozen lake at Lesgeskogen on the 24th April. Operating undergreat difficulties on the following day, this unit reports having shot down 14enemy aircraft, of which 6 are confirmed. Their location was, however, quicklydiscovered by the enemy and they were attacked by a large force of bomberswhich succeeded in destroying sixteen of the Gladiators.54. No interceptions were made during the week by Fighter Command and,on the nights of enemy minelaying activity, weather prevented effective fighteraction. On the night the 30th April-1st May a Heinkel 111 was disabled by anti-aircraft fire and crashed at Clacton. A magnetic mine exploded and caused considerable damage and casualties, as reported in the Press.British Air Forces in France.55. Activity during the week has been very slight. Fighter patrols were maintained on a limited scale, and one reconnaissance was flown, on the night of the 30th April-lst May.Overseas Commands.56. Eleven patrols and eight convoy escorts were provided in the Mediter-ranean, and there were the usual contraband control sorties in the Far East.French Air Force Operations.57. Visual and photographic reconnaissance was maintained daily duringthe week on the Siegfried Line and Rhine fronts,Jn spite of somewhat unfavour-Bohemia.   A large number of fighter patrols were flown, without combat.German Air Operations.58. Western Front.-Activity on the Western Front was less than duringthe previous week, and no combats are reported. There have, however, beenextensive daylight and night reconnaissances, generally at a high altitude, whichhave penetrated far into French territory. There has again been reconnaissanceover the North of France and the Channel ports; and on the afternoon of the1st May three aircraft were plotted off the Dutch coast-able weather.   Some aircraftMunich and WesternAIR INTELLIGENCE.
59. Norway. The general plan of German air operations in Norwayappears to be unchanged and has had considerable success, both in attacking linesof communication and in close support of ground forces. The landplane unitsnow known to have been engaged are as follows : Long-Range Bombers. At full strength, the forces engaged may amount toabout 470 bombers, some 25 per cent, of the German long-range bomber force, Acomparatively small number have been based on the Norwegian aerodromes, andsome have been flown direct from bases in North Germany and Schleswig, ajourney out and home of about 1,200 miles. Others have used Norwegianaerodromes as refuelling points.Dive-Bombers. One Gruppe (39 aircraft), located at Trondhjem. these have been fitted with extra petrol tanks, at the expense of their bomb load, andtheir range has been increased from 420 miles to about 600 miles.Reconnaissance. A total of about ninety aircraft, from Army Co-operation,Bomber-Reconnaissance and Reconnaissance units.Fighters. Two Gruppen of Me. 110 (78 aircraft), and one of Me. 109(39 aircraft).Miscellaneous. One Staffel (13 aircraft) of four-engined aircraft may havebeen used for bombing purposes, but is probably mainly employed on transport.60. Denmark. It is reported that German fighter units have been basedon the Island of Bornholm, and that A.A. guns are being mounted. Aalborgaerodrome is reported to be temporarily unserviceable, but use is being made ofRye and Esbjerg. There are unconfirmed reports of work on two new aerodromes,one at Frederickshavn in the North of Jutland, and one at Borris on the east coast about 24 miles North of Esbjerg.61. North Sea. Activity was again limited to reconnaissance and to mine-laying. Isolated meteorological and other flights were plotted on most daysduring the week in the Western part of the North Sea. On the 27th April oneof these aircraft crossed the Essex coast and was over land for about half-an-hour,flying across London and leaving England near Shoreham; it then flew overNorthern France and returned home across Belgium and Holland. It flew at15,000 feet, largely in thick cloud, and no interception was made. Mine-layingwas carried out in considerable force off the Tyne, Humber and Thames Estuariesand in the Channel on the nights of the 30th April/ 1st May and the 1st/2nd May.France.62. It is believed that difficulties have arisen in the negotiations with Spainfor a Franco-Spanish Air Convention, partly on account of Spanish requests for facilities over French and Moroccan territory. If the negotiations break down, itwill mean that France will not obtain the right to the landing-grounds in Spainformerly used by the Air-France services to Morocco and South America, and thatthe Paris-Lisbon service will continue to operate outside Spanish territory.Sweden.63. One of the newly-formed squadrons of Seversky fighters has beentransferred to Trollhatten to deal with German aircraft violating Swedishneutrality. Two Heinkel Ills have forced-landed in Gotland, through lack of petrol, and one has been shot down at Goteborg.Italy64. At least two, and probably three, new fighter squadrons are located atTrapani in the North-West of Sicily. It is also reported that anti-aircraftpractice has been carried out in the same district on an unprecedented scale.These preparations, and similar reports of work in hand at Pantelleria, suggestthat defensive measures are being taken against a possible threat from Tunis.There are also reports of new aerodromes in the neighbourhood of Turin, Novaraand Milan, some of which are said to have been occupied recently by bomber aircraft.
It is learnt that instructions were given in the Italian Air Force forimmediate readiness for war on the 12th April, and that these instructions were cancelled on the 18th April.  Leave was resumed on the 22nd April.Considerable air training activity has been reported in Libya, and aviationmaterial continues to arrive at Benghazi, though in small quantities. Sixbomber-transport aircraft are shortly to be delivered by air from Italy.Spain.65. It is officially stated that no mobilisation or other precautionary measures have been taken by the Spanish Air Force, and that any appearance ofextraordinary air activity has been due to the annual training period of staff and other officers. It is also stated that former Republican aircraft are beingassembled in the Balearics, in order to bring the fighter unit there up to its fullestablishment. There is at present little anti-aircraft defence in Majorca. Aninspection of aerodromes in the Madrid area does not suggest any unusualactivity. On the other hand, there are reports of the posting of large numbersof technical personnel to the aircraft depot at Tetuan, the working of twenty-four hour shifts at Sabadell aircraft depot, and the despatch of large bomb stocks to Majorca. It should be remembered that their previously acquired knowledgewould facilitate the establishment of German or Italian Air Forces at Spanishair bases.  Majorca is an important factor, as a convenient halting place.66. The Spanish Director-General of Civil Aviation has given an officialassurance that all pilots and crews on the &quot;Iberia&quot; air line from Barcelonato Palma (Majorca) are now of Spanish nationality, and that German crews arenot used except on routes within Spain. One indication of the quantity of goodscoming by air from Italy to Spain is that no passenger accommodation is available on the air line from Barcelona to Cadiz, as the available space is used for goodstraffic from Rome.Turkey.67. The present state of the Turkish re-equipment programme, which shouldbe completed by about October 1940, is as follows Type.	Number Ordered.	Number Delivered.	State of Progress.	Number Outstanding.

Delivery to   begin July, 1940.The Turkish re-equipment programme is being considerably delayed bycrashes and the difficulty of repairing damaged aircraft.   Of the British and american aircraft delivered, at least twenty-four have suffered accidents (fifteenBattles, one Spitfire, four Hurricanes and four Curtiss); some of these cannot[21231] d 2
be made serviceable, and others will be out of service for a year. Four Blenheimshave also been damaged, of which two are repairable. Relatively minor accidentsresult in long periods of unserviceability, as the lack of skilled personnel make sit impossible to do much repair work at the Stations, and usually aircraft mustbe dismantled and sent by rail to the Central Repair Depot at Kayseri, wherethe staff is already overtaxed.Iran.68. The Iranian Government has concluded a contract for the purchase of thirty Curtiss 75a fighters, payment to be made in dollars. At the same time asuggestion has been made that the British personnel employed by the government at the Teheran aircraft factory, where British airframes have been constructedunder licence since 1937, should be dismissed and replaced by Americans. Thereis a considerable risk that they may be replaced, not by Americans, but by Italiansor Russians.
