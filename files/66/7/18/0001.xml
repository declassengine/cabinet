THE WAR&quot;      &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; AGAINST THE ALLIES nReport by the Chiefs of Staff Sub - C ommi 11 e e 0351, .        At their Meeting on 22+th April, 19^-0, the WarCabinet:- &apos;&quot;(a) invited the Chiefs of Staff to re-examine theirpaper W.P. (i+0)  130 in the light of thepresent situation and of the discussion inthe Supreme War Council on 23rd April, and -(b)  approved Alternative A put forward by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs in w.P.(G)  (UO)  109, namely, that a further -attempt should be made to reach an agreementwith the Italian Government-on-economic questions&quot;.2. The Supreme War Council in their second session on 23rd April agreed/-(a) that it should be a governing consideration thatno action should be taken which would belikely to precipitate hostilities with Italybefore the necessary concentration of allied naval, military and air strength in theEastern Mediterranean tyad been completed.(b) that the precise distribution of Allied navalstrengths should be left to the discretion of the British First Lord of the Admiralvyand the French Minister of Marine.- ^ We have accordingly reviewed, the land and airmeasures which might now be, taken to deter Italy from joining our enemies.as W.M.(40)102 Conclusion Minute 8./ S.W.C. .8th .Meeting, Resolutions 5 and 6

3, We have consulted the Foreign Office and their view is:-. (a) There can he no political objection to measures necessary in self defence.(b) If Italy should join our enemies, Mussolini islikely to attempt some spectacular achieve-ment in the very early stages of the war.For   this reason anything we can do toincrease the power of resistance of Malta orGibraltar will have a deterrent value.(c) Mussolini has great confidence in the power ofthe Italian Havy and is prepared to accept some reverses in the Italian Colonial Empire*His great fear, which is shared by themajority of the Italian people, is that thewar might threaten the soil of Italy herself.(d) Although Mussolini might make one of themeasures we recommend below a pretext forwar, his attitude is unlikely to be governed by any considerations other than the progressof the war.    In particular, he is likely tobe influenced by the development of thesituation in Scandinavia,Dodecanese.ak* In our previous report   we recommended that theTurks should make preparations for a combined operation against the Dodecanese.   We now feel that this action isnot likely to act as a deterrent to Mussolini, since itmust be obvious to him that we have neither the naval northe air strength available to implement an attack on the islands.   We have therefore omitted this measure from our recommendations.Kenya,5, Our previous recommendations with regard to Kenyahave now been overtaken by the course of events, since theWar Cabinet have already authorised the move of two west african Brigades to Kenya/and shipping arrangements havebeen made for early June.    The South African Government hasalso agreed to despatch a Brigade to Kenya as soon as shipping can be made available after the end of June.   Nofurther Army reinforcements are necessary,Malta and Gibraltar.6. The Foreign Office suggests that an attempt to gaina spectacular success against Malta or Gibraltar is apossible move by Italy.    If this view is correct it xs clearthat any increases in the defences of these fortresses may prove to some extent a deterrent to Italy.as W,P,(lrO) 130,/ W.M. (2+0)  93rd Conclusions, Item 12

7o        It is thought probable that Italy may be deterredmore by the cumulative effect of several measures, thanby the threat of one measure alone..We therefore recommend:-Qibra,itap and Malta.(i) The garrison c  Gibraltar should be.increased byone inf antry &apos;battaTibnto bring it up to the/strength it was last September.     There is, nothing practicable we can do to increase the powerof resistance of Malta.t)no an.(ii) Ostentatious arrangements should be put in hand,for the move to the Sudan of one or both ofthe Infantry Brigades now held in reserve inPalestine.Aden.(441!) The garrison should be increased by one Infantry..  battalion.   The Government of India haveagreed to provide an additional Indian battalionat short notice as a reinforcement for Aden inthe event of war with Italy.   We consider theavailable.move should be made as soon as shipping is(iv) Air Forces:    The three squadrons which theSouth African Government have offered for service in Kenya should be moved to Kenya assoon as modern aircraft can be provided.Somaliland.  .(v) One battalion has already been ordered toSomaliland from Kenya and is to move in .midMay,,    Nothing further can be spared from Kenyauntil the arrival of the West African troops(paragraph 5), but ostentatious arrangements should be made for the move of a secondbattalion,Egypt and Palestine,(vi) Air Forces:(a) The two Indian bomber squadrons from Singaporeshould be moved to Egypt instead ofremaining in India, where they are atpresent.    Their return to India was designedto meet a possible Russian threat.   from egypt they could be returned to India inapproximately 14 days, and to Singaporein 21 days.

(b) The Rhodes!an squadron in Kenya should hemoved to Egypt on the arrival of the firstSouth African Squadron in Kenya(p ar agr aph 7 (iv)).(c) An Australian squadron should he moved from australia to Palestine as soon as aircraft can he made available.Land Forces:   Every effort should be made toincrease&quot;our defences in the Western Desertand the communications with Egypt.French North- Africa.(vii) The French should be asked to consider there constitution of the forces which we under-stand they have withdrawn from Tunisia sincethe outbreak of war,  and which would benecessary for offensive action against Libya.We do not consider that this action would beregarded as provocative if the French informedItaly of their intentions and explained thatno increase of the normal peace garrison of north Africa was intended.Jibuti.(viii) The French might also be asked to consider the reinforcement of Jibuti0Europe.(ix) Plans and preparations should be concerted withthe French at once to enable bombers to operate against the industrial area in NorthItaly.    We consider that these preparations should be unobtrusive though not sufficientlysecret to escape the Italian intelligence.8* We feel that Mussolini&apos;s chief fear is that thewar may penetrate into his own country.   Thus anypreparations for launching rapidly an effective air attackon the industrial areas in North Italy would be a powerfuldeterrent, and is the best means of inducing him to keepout of the warB we also feel that if any of the other measures we have recommended are to have effect they must be implemented y/ithout delay.DUDLEY POUND,-JcG.
