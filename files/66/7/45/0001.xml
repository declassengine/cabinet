P. (14-0)165fAlso O.O.S.(U0)375).COPY NO22ND MAY, 19u1.WAR CABINET.MILITARY IMPLICATIONS OPjV complete withdrawal&quot; PROM iTORWAY.Appreciation by the Chiefs of staff Committee.In view of the general gravity of the situation onthe Western Front and the obvious necessity for cutting our commitments in secondary theatres of war to a minimum, wehave been considering the implications of a complete withdrawal from Norway.Objects of the Narvik Operations.2o The objects of H.M. Government in prosecutingoperations at Narvik are:-(a) Denial of iron ore through that port to Germany.(b) Interference with the export of iron ore from.Lulea to Germany,  and(c) The maintenance of a seat of government and a centre of resistance in Noi^way.Object (a) has probably already been achieved for months to come as a result of the destruction effected bythe Navy and by the enemy.    The chances of carrying outobject (b) effectively depend on the active co-operation ofthe Swedes, a condition which is unlikely to be fulfilled.We refer in a later paragraph to the more limited results which might be expected from operation &quot;Paul&quot;.    Themaintenance of a seat of government and a centre of resistance in Norway is therefore the only true remainingobject of the Narvik operations.Arguments for withdrawal.3. These are:-(a) The idea that our detachment at Narvik willkeep Norwegian resistance alive is to someextent fallacious,  since any seriousresistance must fall to the lot of the Frenchand British forces.    The Norwegians haveneither the numbers, the material, nor the heart to offer a firm core on which to build.Recent telegrams&quot;from. Norway indicate thatthe Norwegian Government may be consideringcoming to terms with Germany.36 Unnumbered telegram from Mr. Lascelles dated 17th May,

hi */ M(b) The land and air forces now allotted for operations in Norway - and we can make no more available i- are less than those which general Auchinleck considers necessary forthe retention of the Bodo, Narvik and Tromsoareas.      The deficiency is marked in the caseof A.A. guns.    The one squadron of Hurricanesand the one squadron of Gladiators now ear-marked for Narvik would he insufficient tomake that place tenable in the face of thescale of air attack which the Germans could put out from bases in Southern NorwayMoreover it will be most difficult to maintainthese two squadrons, which will certainlysuffer a high rate of wastage.     MoreHurricanes cannot be spared, Gladiators areno longer manufactured and reserves of this type are very few.(c) We are particularly short of A.A. guns and aircraft.     The withdrawal of the 48 heavy and 60 light A.A. guns and the fighter aircraft at Narvik could not be effected intime to influence the land battle now beingfought in-France.      These air defenceresources would be invaluable if the enemybrings his main weight of attack to bear onthis country in the coming weeks, as isprobable.(d) The establishment of our army and air forcesat Narvik is proving a most heavy navalcommitment.     A list of the forces employedon 20th May is attached at Annex I.Demands on destroyers are particularly heavy.Their release would approximately double the destroyer strength immediately availableto oppose an enemy expedition against thiscountry.On the other hand, after the passage to Narvikof two important convoys during the next7 days, a reduction in our naval commitmentsshould be possible. Even so the allocation of naval forces for Narvik will cause areduction in those available for home watersthat we can ill afford.In addition to the forces directly employedin connection with the Narvik commitment,the problem of providing cover for these forces would conflict to some extent  withthe provision of cover for forces engagedin defending this country against invasion.

(e) Our present operations in Norway do not constitute a profitable military detachment.It is true that the Germans have 11 divisions in &apos;the country and that we have the    equivalent of only 1-g- divisions.      But the Germansemployed their forces to overcome southern norway and there is no reason for them tocontinue to lock up large forces in Norwaymerely because we are at Narvik.      There are,in fact; reports that they are alreadyevacuating considatable forces from, thecountry.Further it must be realised that German airconcentrations in Norway can he used toattack either Great Britain or Narvik,whereas our own air forces and A.A. guns at narvik can only he used in a local role..Arguments against Withdrawal.4. These are:-(a) Reports indicate that the Germans intend to relieve Narvik.    If this is so, they mayattack Sweden and we think that Swedenmight resist so long as there are allied forces in Norway.,    German attack on Swedenwould clearly he to our advantage, in thatit would, imperil German iron ore supplies from Lulea and would be a further diversion of German forces.(b) While we are in the Narvik area the Germans maycontinue to divert some of their air forces to attacking us there.     Any such diversionwould reduce the weight of attack on theUnited Kingdom and France.(c) If we . y.&apos;1,fcMrew from Narvik without havingdestroyed, the railway effectively, theGermans would only have to repair the port facilities, which we estimate -they would beable to do in about six months.      In view oftheir possession of the Southern norwegian coast, the Germans would then be able tomaintain a small proportion of their importsof iron ore throughout the winter.This is therefore a strong argument for stayingat Narvik at least until we have destroyed the railway.(d) Operation $Paul5 will almost certainly be impracticable after we withdraw from Narvik.A land aerodrome for that operation isnecessary.      Once we abandon Narvik the only possible aerodrome would be at Karlboten,.near Kirkenes,  and the chances of our being able to operate from there once.the germans were in Narvik would be very remote.

(e) The operation of withdrawing our forces wouldinvolve heavy naval and shipping commitments.(f) There is reason io hope that we shall shortlycapture Narvik0    The success, although of minor military importance would hearten ourown people, the Norwegians and the Swedes.(g) If we remain in Northern Norway we shall he ableto import iron ore and timber from Kirkenes,and high grade Swedish steel in limitedquantitieso   Of these the timber and Swedishsteel are particularly important,    We shouldalso retain one avenue of communication via the Arctic Highway, with Sweden and Finland.(h) We have given our word to support the Norwegians..(i) We understand from the Ministry of Shippingthat we might find it extremely difficult toretain control of that large proportion of norwegian tonnage, the use of which we atpresent enjoy,,   Moreover, the Ministry ofShipping take the view that withdrawal from norway might endanger the continued co-operationof Swedish shipowners of whose shipping we now have a large volume in our service.Conclusions.5. There are clearly substantial arguments both forand against withdrawalo    To arrive at a correct divisionit is, therefore, necessary to consider what is and whatis not essentials   The security of France and the UnitedKingdom is essential, the retention of Northern Norway isnot.    The question then is - will a withdrawal from Norwayassist the security of France or the United Kingdom?6. The security of France probably depends on the battle now in progress0   A withdrawal from Norway cannotassist France in that battle.7. In the near future we shall require in the UnitedKingdom and Home Waters all the forces that can be mustered.A withdrawal from Norway now could probably be carried outin time to allow of the forces there becoming available.8, A conclusive argument in favour of withdrawal isthat we c annot find the minimum requirements which theCommander on the spot has said that he requires to maintainhis position in Northern Norway3   This applies particularly to fighter aircraft and Ac A.  equipments..Pro-posed Armistice, in NprtjaernJKforwaz-9. We have considered a proposal, put forward by aM. Dahlerus, that an armistice should be negotiated inNorthern Norway under the aegis of the Swedish Government *The precise terms of this armistice are not specified, butit is understood that the proposal is that Allied and enemy forces should both withdraw from Northern Norway, whichwould then be    regarded as neutral territory asd: under thecontrol of the Swedes,.   Among the advantages^claimed for suchan arrangement are that we should be able to withdrawwithout loss of prestige and would retain Swedish and norwegian goodwill..

10o       We have had the advice of the Foreign Office on theproposed armistice hut we doubt very much whether time will allow of the necessary negotiations being completed^From the military point of view, however, we see no harmin the attempt being made.    The capture of Narvik mightwell increase the chances of reaching a successfulagreement on these lines.   We would point out, however, thatif a decision is taken to withdraw from Northern Norway,the operation should be carried out at the appropriate moment,&apos;irrespective of these negotiations..Recommendations;3.1. .     We accordingly recommend that, owing to our inability to provide adequate forces to hold northern norway permanently, our present forces must be withdrawn.It would be to our advantage to withdraw them as soon aspossible, to strengthen our Home defences.    Nevertheless,we consider that every effort should be made to captureNarvik before the withdrawal, as this will give us the chance to destroy the rail and port facilities and willrnake/operation of withdrawal less difficulty12.

Begins.To Chiefs of Staff from Lt.-General AUCHINLECK.Reference 1129/17 from Chiefs of Staff following remarksrepresent my considered opinion after consultation with LordCork and Group Captain Moore.     They are based on assumptionsituation in Norway remains generally as it is now.     Anyradical change such as surrender by Norwegian Government,Russian (^advance) through Finland or a German offensive fromLulea or by air and sea from Murmansk is not repeat notcatered for.      They should be read in conjunction with LordCork1s telegram No.2217/18/5 which explains strategic situationthis theatre.      First land forces namely 12 French and 3 British&quot;battalions plus 10 Independent companies which one is understood&quot;bo he administrative should suffice provided 3 Field Batteries25 pounder or i+,5 howitzers 2 6-inch howitzer batteries some kind of mobile unit for patrolling 1 machine gun battalionalso h field and one field Park Company which are essentialto operations in this difficult country can be sent withoutfurther delay.     h.8 heavy and 60 light anti-aircraft gunscan of course he distributed to give some apparent protection to vital areas hut this is unlikely to be effective shouldenemy put in heavy air attacks on bases and aerodromes as appears probable.Part 1 ends.      Part 2 follows separately.

PART .2.    Begins.It is RjHTjiRAT-jD    that de struct ion of aerodrome at jdARDOSS or of port facilities and accommodation atHARSTAD might in existing circumstances makeposition of the force untenable in a short time.    i cannot agree that there is reasonable prospect my being able t.o achieve my tasic if less half of my considereddemand for anti-aircraft artillery is to be providedwhich itself is only 2/3 of the original estimate preparedby General Staff at War Office before my departure from london.Second Air Forces.     The range of Gladiatoraircraft is very limited e*nd even Hurricane cannot giveeffective support in BODO area where it is urgently needed, from base SiilAANLAKD.      To maintain effective patrolover base areas and fleet anchorages and patrols inHARSTAD-NARVIa area 2 squadrons Hurricane are minimum required.     Failure to provide bombers will deprive me of only effective means of replying to enemy offensives and thereby strengthening morale forces both naval andmilitary which is being steadily undermined by Germansuperiority in the air and is causing me anxiety.      Somebomber aircraft are essential to achievement of objectand 1 squadron is minimum.    1 plight Army co-operationaircraft is entirely inadequate in relation to area tobe covered.Part 2 ends,   part 3 follows separately.

PART 5.      BeginsBThe inevitably of evacuation ofNorthern Norway in circumstances envisaged inyour telegram is in my opinion entirely dependenton enemy&apos;s will to avail himself of hisundoubted ability to attack0     Should he attackI cannot with reduced forces suggested by youhold myself responsible for the safety of this force nor will I pretend there is any reasonablecertainty of my being able to achieve objectgiven to me in my instructions.If in spite of this larger considerationslead H.M. Government to decide that northern norway must continue to be held with diminishedresources laid down by them I cannot answer forthe consequences but you may rest assured that every effort will be made to do what is possible with the resources at my disposal.Part 3 ends.     Message terminates.

annex ry\&quot;    &apos; &apos; &quot; 301Prom P.O.I.C. Narvik. Date   21.5.40.1928/20 May. Reed. 1602.Addressed Admiralty.297.-  ... For Chiefs of Staff,Your 0030/20 The Troops Aircraft A.A. Guns and fastLight craft suggested are what are considered necessaryfor the defence of Northern Norway.      If they cannot he found the best possible must be done without them.     I fullyunderstand that occupation of the town of Narvik is desired and am anxious to report it&apos;s capture,,     The mostimportant work at the moment however is the completionand protection of Aerodromes and for this all r.L.C&apos;s arerequired,If we are to maintain our position here it is of paramount importance that we can operate Aircraft as quickly as possible and be able to counter German Bombers.     Indeedunder altered conditions it might be said to be a necessary preliminary to a combined operation on whatever scale.It is very probable only a small Garrison is left inNarvik.      The landing at Bjervik was a first step and itwas proposed to follow it up0 The Troops are ready todo so.     It would take 36 hours at most to prepare anassault.       In my view however it would be folly under existing conditions to switch off from the essentialpreparation of Aerodrome to that of attacking Narvika place which does not affect main issue and which can begot on with at the end of this week .     A delay there doesnot matter, a delay with Aerodrome is dangerous.     It isintended to capture this force if possible but it isMountain Fighting.(?),     Germans falling back beforeFrench advance and it may well end in Enemy slipping overFrontier and French occupying Railway, their presentobjective. Slow is thick on Mountain Tops, melting on slopes.
