General Review.THERE has been incessant naval and air activity in Northern watersthroughout the week, and naval units have been employed in escorting militaryforces to their ports of disembarkation on the Norwegian Coast.Northern Waters.2. A chronological summary of the principal events in Norwegian watersis given below.Thursday, April 11.3. Submarines on patrol in the Kattegat reported very strong anti-sub-marine patrols and considerable air activity. During the night of thelOth-llth April ELM. Submarine Spearfrsh attacked a heavy ship off the Skawwhich she reports was almost certainly the Admiral Scheer. Six torpedoes werefired of which at least one was a hit. A later French report states that a pocketbattleship was seen p.m. the 12th April being towed to Frederikshaven (20 miles south of Skaw) in a sinking condition.During the afternoon the Main Fleet were bombed while patrolling off theNorwegian coast to westward of Halten Bank. H.M.S. Eclipse was hit in the engine room and was towed to the westward by H.M.S. Escort, eventuallyarriving at Sollum Voe (Shetlands).   .H.M.S. Isis and H.M.S. Ilex examined the fjords outside Trondhjem. no enemy ships were found, but they were fired on ineffectively by shore batteries-off Trondhjem Fjord and later H.M.S. Isis was bombed without result. IT.M.S.Penelope, while engaged in a search for German merchant ships entering VestFjord, ran aground off Fleinvoer during the afternoon and was holed forward.She was towed off by H.M.S. Eskimo and reached Skjelfjord safely but with -B boiler room flooded.At 1800 H.M.S. Tartar carried out two attacks on a U-Boat 10 miles east-ward of Orkneys with promising results.In an attack carried out during the night by our bombers on transports andwarships in the Kattegat one ammunition ship was blown up.Norwegian ships sank a German tanker in Tannholm Fjord. The Swedeswere reported to have mined the coast off Gothenburg.Friday, April 12.4. At 0545 aircraft reported one battleship and one cruiser 40 miles west of Jaederens, course E. by S. Subsequent reports increased this to two battle-ships. They were shadowed until 0915, when they were lost in fog. Bombers-were sent to look for this force, but failed to make contact.H.M.S. Glasgow and H.M.S. Sheffield with 6 destroyers searched theNorwegian leads northward from Aalesund, the destroyers searching inside andthe cruisers providing cover and air reconnaissance from seaward.Information was received that one hundred and forty men from H.M.S. Hardy,.vdiich was wrecked during the attack on Narvik on the 10th April, had landed atBallanger, near Narvik.H.M.S. Aurora flying the flag of Admiral of the Fleet Lord Cork and^-M-S. Southampton carrying General Mackesey sailed for Vaagsfjord. Convoy-N.P. 1, consisting of 5 troop transports, with H.M.S. Protector in company, andescorted by H.M. Ships Manchester, Birmingham, Vindictive, Cairo and destroyers, also sailed for Vaagsfjord, and were joined later by H.M.S. Valiant..During the afternoon twenty F.A.A. Skuas from Hatston attacked Bergen..wo definite hits on ships were seen, but an explosive store was blown up. One^skua failed to return.At 1900 a dive bombing attack was made by aircraft from H.M.S. Furious011 ships in Narvik. Five destroyers and.eleven merchant ships were seen. two destroyers were hit, one seriously. One aircraft forced-landed and two failed toreturn.Contact was made with the Norwegian submarine B 3 in Vestf jord.[21173] b
Saturday, April 13.5. H.M.S. Warspite and 9 destroyers, supported by aircraft from H.M.S.Furious, attacked Narvik at noon and destroyed all seven enemy destroyers there^three of which fled up an adjacent Fjord before being sank. Aircraft from theWarspite reported destroying a U-boat, and aircraft from the Furious as havingobtained two direct hits on a U-boat. No enemy warships were left at Narvik.H.M.S.Eskimo had her bows blown off by a torpedo. H.M.S. Cossack was damaged and ran aground, but has since arrived safely at Skjelf jord, and H.M.S. Punjabihad one boiler put out of action.   Two of our aircraft were lost.Enemy aircraft appeared after the action but made no attack.Six destroyers carried out an extensive sweep of Stor Fjord, Aalesund, Moldeand Romsdals Fjord, with H.M.S. Glasgow and H.M.S. Sheffield in supportoutside the leads.Some of the destroyers were bombed twice without result, but three german aircraft forced-landed on shore and crews were taken prisoners. No enemy ships were sighted. Three Norwegian and one Danish merchant ships were sent underguard to Kirkwall.Contact with Norwegian authorities was made at Aalerkne and Molde, who reported no enemy yet landed at Kristiansund (North) or Romsdals Fjord, andwho confirmed that no enemy warships were between Stadtlandet andKristiansund (North).H.M.S. Devonshire and four destroyers searched for enemy forces in theTromso area. H.M.S. Berwick and two destroyers searched the fjords betweenTromso and Narvik. Aircraft reported two cruisers, possibly Nurnbergs, atKristiansund (South) and one cruiser and one destroyer off Skudesnaes Fjord nearStavanger.  A reconnaissance was made of Vaernes, near Trondhjem.H.M.S. Suffolk covered by two destroyers landed a force of Royal Marinesat the Faroe Islands.During the night H.M. Submarine Cachalot, while on passage from Blyth toImmingham to embark mines, was in collision with an Italian steamer nearWhitby and was holed aft, but arrived safely in the Tyne.Sunday, April 14.6. In the morning the Fleet Air Arm carried out two attacks on Bergen and obtained hits on one transport alongside and damaged the jetty. One aircraft was shot down.H.M.S. Glasgow successfully landed 300 men at Namsos.-  H.M. Submarine Narwhal laid mines in the Kattegat between Laeso island and the east coast of Jutland.  She was hunted during the operation and expendedsix torpedoes without result.&apos;   H.M.S. Kimberley reported Narvik. Harbour now strongly held by machine-gun posts, and that she had cut adrift German flying boats.H.M. Submarine Thistle failed to report and was subsequently reported aslost.Monday, April 15.H.M.S. Aurora arrived at Risoy Sound, north of Narvik, with H.M.S.Southampton, one transport and two destroyers.The German submarine U.49 was sunk in Vaagsfjord by H.M. DestroyersHA^T^^^1^ Fearless, Brazen send [Amethyst when sweeping ahead of the entering troop)_ convoy.   Four officers and 36 ratings were saved.&quot; Two transports with H.M. ships  Vindictive, Protector, Cairo and two destroyers arrived at the neighbouring anchorage of Harstad.H.M.S. Warspite and 10 destroyers continued the blockade of Narvik.H.M.S. Somali examined the Namsos area supported by H.M.S. Glasgow and h.M.S. Sheffield to seaward. She was attacked four times by aircraft. In thelast attack, which continued for two hours, 53 bombs were dropped but she wasnot hit. Convoy F.P.1 consisting of 4 French troop transports escorted by french destroyers sailed from the Clyde for Lillesjona, H.M.S. Repulse acting as cover. Air reconnaissance over Bergen showed no enemy warships or aircraft and no enemy movements ashore.  Fifty empty merchant vessels were seen.
Nine Swordfish aircraft from H.M.S. Furious attacked nine Junkers 87 Ctroop carrying aircraft, which were discovered immobilised on a frozen lake10 miles north of Narvik. Two of the enemy aircraft were destroyed and others,were damaged by machine-gun fire. ^Two enemy destroyers were located 70 miles S.W. of Egeesund and attackedwithout result; also two enemy patrol vessels in the Heligoland Bight.Tuesday, April 16.8. The two troop carriers Chrobry and Empress of A australia, originallybound for Vaagsf jord but diverted to Lillesjona, arrived in the morning havingbeen escorted by H.M. ships Manchester, Birmingham, Curlew and 8 destroyers.The oiler War Pindari also arrived at Lillesjona. Captain D.6 in the Somaliand 6 other destroyers under the command of the Vice-Admiral Commanding18th Cruiser Squadron in H.M.S. Manchester carried out the operation offerrying troops from Lillesjona to Namsos. During the afternoon the twotransports and H.M.S. Manchester and the remainder of the escort werepersistently bombed.   Several near misses were reported but no hits.Before midnight two battalions and some stores had been disembarked namsos from 4 destroyers, and subsequent^ two destroyers embarked the navalparties which had been landed there on the 14th April and returned them with.M.S. Glasgow and H.M.S. Sheffield.The Flag Officer in charge of the Narvik area reported that until theconditions of snow and ice improve, about the end of April, operations acrosscountry are impossible. In co-operation with the Military Commander he intends to commence redistributing the forces on the 19th April to positions closer toNarvik in readiness for an attack on the German force at Bjerkevik, 8 miles from narvik at the head of Herjangs Fjord.A report having been received that Andalsnes was being occupied by troops from seaplanes, H.M.S. Calcutta and H.M.S. Jupiter were sent with all despatch to land a party of 50 until the arrival of further forces already en route.At 1900 hours aircraft reported 5 enemy destroyers off Stavanger steeringnorthward at high speed. As it was considered that they might be proceeding to occupy Aalesund, H.M. ships York, Effingham and Ashanti were divertedthere with all despatch. An offensive reconnaissance of Bergen was carried outby Skua aircraft which bombed a small U-Boat near Bergen; they also bombed and sank a small auxiliary vessel.In the evening an aircraft attacked a U-Boat without success about 30 miles west of Karmo.Wednesday, April 17.9. At midnight 16th-17th April Captain (D) 8th flotilla in H.M.S. Faulknordestroyed a dump of ammunition and petrol landed by German destroyers north-east of Narvik Bay. A preliminary reconnaissance to locate it resulted in theloss of one rating killed.In view of the air menace connected with the transfer of troops by destroyersfrom Lillesjona to Namsos, the Vice-Admiral Commanding 18th cruiser squadron transferred the remaining troops from the Empress of Australia tothe Chrobry together with as many stores as possible, and all proceeded to seaat 0300 hours. Captain (D) 4th flotilla took over the escort of the Chrobry at noonand led her into Namos at dusk. She arrived safely and disembarkationcommenced at 2145 hours. The approach of the transport was covered byH.M.S. Glasgow and H.M.S. Sheffield.Between 0445 and 0605 hours H.M.S. Suffolk fired 217 rounds at stavanger aerodrome. Observation of fire was difficult as aircraft communication broke down. During the action a torpedo was seen to miss astern. On her returnH-M.S. Suffolk was bombed persistently and sustained one hit and several near misses which caused considerable damage and reduced her speed to 15 knots. Hercasualties were 27 killed and 34 wounded. Thirty-three dive-bombing attacks were made and 82 bombs dropped in high-level attack. She arrived safely inkcapa escorted by H.M.S. Renown and nine destroyers. During the attacks fleet air Arm aircraft brought down 2 enemy aircraft and damaged 3..  H.M.S. Berwick and H.M.S. Devonshire arrived at Tromso from Kirkneswith a transport carrying a battalion of Norwegian troops.    The Germanammunition ship detained by the Norwegians at Kirknes, which it had beentended to seize, had been allowed by the Norwegians to proceed to Finland.T21173 I b 2
Shore stocks of 9,000 tons of oil fuel were found at Tromso where destroyerscan oil alongside and Admiralty oilers can top up.H.M.S. Calcutta, when close to Andalsnes where she had been ordered toland 50 men, sighted a U-boat, and after attacking it without success retired toseaward.H.M. ships Black Swan, Auckland, Bittern and Flamingo arrived atAndalsnes and disembarked Landing parties. Their entrance had been coveredby H.M. ships Calcutta, York, Effingham and Ashanti.A further force consisting of 1,000 troops, commanded by Brigadier Morganin H.M. ships Galatea, Are-thus a, Carlisle, Curacoa and 2 destroyers has sailed from Fcosyth.Note. Casualties sustained during the week&apos;s operations are shown inAppendix I.British Minelaying.10. Fifty mines have been laid by H.M.S. Narwhal during the current week:in the Kattegat. A further 83 have been laid in the Western German Estuariesand Danish Eastern waters.The laying of a defensive minefield across the mouth of the Firth of Clydewas announced on the 17th April.Intelligence of German Submarines.11.   The estimated position of enemy submarines on the 17th April was asfollows :   10 off the west coast of Norway between 610 30&apos; N. and 690 N16 between 57&quot; 50&apos; N., 610 05&apos; N., and between Orkneys and Shetlands and norway, 2 probably west of the Orkneys, 1 off the Firth of Forth, and 3 oceaiirgoing boats whose positions are unknown.Protection of Seaborne Trade.12. In the week ended noon, Wednesday, the 17th April, the number ofvessels in British Convoys was : British       ...............      772 &quot;JAllied        ...............        77 y Total = 1,005.Neutral       .......      ...       ......       156 there were no losses in convoy during the week.Sixty-one ships (including 10 neutrals) arrived from West Atlantic ports,.20 from Sierra Leone, and 60 (including 3 neutrals) from Gibraltar.Thirty destroyers (including 5 French) and 17 sloops were employed on escort duties, and 2 battleships and 5 armed merchant cruisers as ocean escorts.Twenty-five tankers brought 303,227 tons of oil. Ores and minerals totalled130,935 tons and cereals 148,217 tons. Other foods imported included 56,319 tonsof sugar and molasses, and the general cargoes included large consignments of rubber, jute, cotton, cotton seed, wool, sisal and hides.Since commencement of hostilities the total numbers convoyed have been :-British   ...      ...      ...      ......      14,0101Allied     ......      ......... 906 1 Total = 17,746Neutral  ...      ............        2,830 Jof these 25 British, 1 Allied and 3 neutral vessels have been sunk : an average ofone in 612.   The neutral losses average one in 943.German Minelaying.13. In addition to mines laid between Denmark and Norway mentioned lastweek, Germany has since broadcast information of mines laid in the Great and little Belts outside the Danish ports of Frederica, Wyborg and Korsoer.  The
Norwegians reported an enemy minefield at the entrance to a fjord a boat 60 miles west of Narvik. The Norwegian Senior Naval Officer at Tromso is sending twomotor minesweepers to sweep this area.Other reports of suspected enemy minelaying include one of aircraft layingmines about 55 miles east of Harwich; also of a minelayer which though flyingthe Netherlands flag was thought to be German, and was operating in the northernDart of the original German declared area in the eastern part of the North Sea.There was considerable enemy air activity off the east and south-east coastsdurin0&quot; the night of the 7th-18th April. Some of these aircraft were believed to have been minelaying, and the Downs were closed as a precaution.British Minesweeping.14. During the weekTfrom the 10th April to the 17th April no moored mines have been swept or cut. Sixteen magnetic mines have been destroyed during thisperiod, bringing the total since the beginning of the war to 118.a&apos; new magnetic mined area has been discovered during the week inMorecambe Bay. Skids have exploded two mines, and magnetic sweeps one.A dangerous area has been declared, which closes the port of Preston. this area includes a section of the searched channel between Liverpool and the ports to the northward, and the newly established channel has added 13 miles to the distance to be covered by ships proceeding on this route. It is possible that thesemines were laid at the same time as those outside Liverpool, but have remainedundiscovered owing to the searched channel being to the westward of the apparentmined area, and the fact that the port of Preston is used mainly by light draughtvessels.   Two trawlers have been ordered to Liverpool to assist operations.Four mines have been exploded by L.L. trawlers in the Orfordness area.One of the trawlers was damaged. It is hoped to clear a channel to seaward viathis route for ships based on Harwich.Seven mines have been exploded in the Tongue area by the D.W.I. flying in formation.The A-A. sweep scored its first success in the dangerous area in the middleof the Bristol Channel south of Swansea on the 13th April.There are now eight pairs of L.L. trawlers operating, and another two pairsshould be available almost immediately.Casualties to German Merchant Ships in Northern Waters.15. H.M. Submarine Triad torpedoed a 4,000 ton German steamer southof the entrance to Oslo Fjord on the 11th April.H.M. Submarine Sunfish reported having sunk four German merchant vesselsestimated total tonnage 17,700 during her patrol.H.M. Submarine Snapper attacked a convoy off the Skaw on the 15th april and obtained two hits and possibly four.The following is a list of German merchant shipping losses during theweek from the llth-18th April in addition to sinkings by the above-mentionedsubmarines :  Ship.Tonnage.Reliability.Date.Remarks.Amasis7,129     I PressAugust 2,593LeonhardtOurityba...Kattegat..MoorsundSkagenak4,9696,0313216,044ConfirmedPressPressConfirmedConfirmedApril 8April 11April 11April 14April 12April 14Torpedoed   off   S.W.

The Norwegian Tanker tonnage is estimated to be 2,150,000 gross, whichhas a carrying capacity of about 3,000,000 tons dead weight.The Norwegian tanker tonnage is the third largest in the world, and com-prises 9 ships of 10,000 tons and upwards, and 234 ships of 1,000 tons and upwards. .MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.20. Local patrol activity and attempted raids have taken place at various points. These raids have in most cases been repulsed with loss to the enemy. Fourattempts were made by the enemy to attack French posts across the Rhine in upper Alsace.Artillery activity showed some increase over the previous week.21. A feature of the week has been the increase in the number of reportsstating that an offensive on the west was imminent. These reports came from sources of varying degrees of reliability and some of the dates mentioned havealready passed.Reports also indicate a movement of active divisions into the Eifeldistrict, mainly from the Dusseldorf-Koln area, while a concentration of armoured divisions has been reported east of Aachen. On the other hand, otheractive divisions have probably moved from the Eifel into the Aachen area, and itis possible that one or two have been withdrawn to take part in the operations in scandinavia.Work on the improvement of roads continues, including those leading to theLuxemburg frontier.Considerable bridging activity has been observed on the Rhine (North ofMainz), and on the Rivers Moselle and Saar.Other points of interest include the withdrawal of labour employed onfortifications facing the Dutch frontier, the laying of forward telephone lines,and the erection of signposts giving directions to Dutch towns. A number of newfield hospitals have also been established.Germany.22. Recently a series of reports have been received to the effect that anumber of German divisions were being moved to S.E. Europe, into Austria,southern Poland, and the Protectorate. A high proportion of the reports which speak of reinforcements being sent to Austria seem to have beendisseminated by German sources, but one or two divisions may have arrived therefrom Central Germany since the beginning of April.   There is more evidence ofNo. of GrossShips. Tonnage.102 305,60021 26,11110 5.494133 337,205No. of GrossShips. Tonnage.19 78,078204 542,10123 100,967246 721.146
the reinforcement of southern Poland, and in the eastern part of the Protectorate-of Bohemia and Moravia there may be an additional four or five divisions, all 0fwhich seem to be of low category. .It is, however, clear that some 14 or 15 German divisions, distributed inS.E. Europe, could be made available for an offensive in this area. They couldbe reinforced from the centre and east of Germany by a proportion of mechaniseddivisions, and moves eastwards of these divisions might be carried out without prior warning.23. The distribution of German divisions on the 17th April was believed to be as follows :  Area.	Cav.	Armd.	Lt.	Mot.	Inf.	Totals.Western Theatre Central Germany Scandinavia   ... Baltic Coast, including Corridor and East Prussia Poland, excluding Corridor ...

A report has now been received from a reliable source that two to four of the existing German armoured divisions will be changed into heavyarmoured divisions by the issue of a new 36-ton tank.Northern Front.British Landings.25. In the Narvik area, Major-General Mackesy and two companies of theScots Guards landed at Salangen on the 14th April. The remainder of GeneralMackesy&apos;s force, the 24th Infantry Brigade, landed at Haastad on the 15th April.One company of the Irish Guards was sent forward to Evenes on the NarvikFiord, 15 miles west of Narvik, on the 17th.In Central Norway, two battalions of the 146th Infantry Brigade landed namsos at 4-40 a.m. on the 17th April, and the remainder of the brigade went:ashore during the following night. This force did not proceed direct from england to Namsos as originally intended; the convoy being directed initially toLilleijona, 150 miles further north, owing to the danger of air attack. Here thefirst two battalions were transferred to cruisers and destroyers and landed in-darkness. The remainder of the brigade landed later direct from their transport,S.S. Chrobry.   Grong and Bangsund were occupied on the t 1th April.The German Invasion.26. It is still impossible to determine exactly the strength of the forcesused to invade Denmark and Norway, but present indications are that two to three divisions were employed for the invasion of Denmark,- and a minimum ofthree for Norway. Of these six divisions, three at least appear to be reserve divisions.The occupation of Denmark is complete, and the latest information is thatfairly strong German forces have been moved to Elsinore where they would be readily available to reinforce Norway, or, if need be, for operations in Sweden.&apos; German operations in Norway appear to have proceeded according to plan,but there seems little doubt that the German High Command was surprised by
the decision of the Norwegians to resist. Since the initial landing, reinforce-.ments have been sent to the Oslo area by sea. Troops elsewhere in southern norway have been principally reinforced and supplied by air. For this purposea number of air transport groups have been employed.The German military plan seems to aim at isolating Southern Norway by holding a line from Trondheim to the Swedish frontier. With this objectTrondheim has been reinforced. If the Germans succeed in holding andreinforcing this line, they will be in a position to isolate the Norwegian forces inthe south, and, if they then employ light armoured forces operating from Oslonorthwards, it would place those Norwegian forces in a still more difficult position.The weakness of the resistance offered by the Norwegian forces to the german attack is largely due to the fact that the invasion surprised them before they hadmobilised. Many units were unable to concentrate effectively and were cut off from the main forces. In addition, the Germans captured many of the arsenalsand depots. As a result, although volunteers and reservists exist in plenty thereare insufficient arms for them. In general, the Norwegian forces are very lackingin artillery and anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. In addition the morale of the Army is not good and there are even disloyal elements. Reports of the surrender of fortresses by treachery have been received from several sourcesThe majority of the troops are, however, now fighting stubbornlyItaly.27. The 1917 class of recruits (due for discharge in March) has beenretained beyond its normal period, and the Italian Army is estimated to be about1,200,000 strong. The Army is now composed almost entirely of men aged between20 and 23. An unconfirmed report indicates the recall of men aged 24 (1916class) on the 21st April, which would make the Army over 1,400,000 strong and enable it to mobilise at its war establishment of 1,000,000 using only trained men. The announcement of a decree empowering the calling up of classes 1911-14is believed to apply to the few that had been previously exempted from service.A rumour of troop concentrations at Bari has not so far been substantiated.The rumour may have arisen on account of the despatch of labourers destined for work in Albania. At the same time, a press report, stating that Bari and itsvicinity should be treated by aircraft as a prohibited area, ostensibly on accountof gunnery practice, lends some colour to the rumour of troop concentrations.No important reinforcement of overseas territories has taken place duringthe week. The garrisons of Libya and the Dodecanese remain approximately at war establishment, whilst that of Albania is probably still below. In con-sequence, none of these possessions are at present provided with additional troops to meet war wastage, such as might be expected if active operations were contemplated.U.S.S.R.28. There have been no signs of any abnormal military activity and themovement of troops from the Finnish frontier to their peace stations continues.It is possible that some further reinforcements have been sent to the Caucasus.Further reports confirm the unsatisfactory nature of the internal situation at the end of the Finnish war. There was much discontent at the deterioration in conditions of living which led to some agitation for improvements and for increases in pay.Sweden...29.   It is reported that Swedish mobilisation was  completed on theloth April.   Sweden has strengthened her forces in the south, by the transferone corps headquarters and one infantry division, from the forces which were concentrated in the extreme north during the Soviet-Finnish War.Finland.th   ^   ^ r?cent visitor to Finland reports that morale is once again high andhas co^,struction of fortifications along the new frontier has begun.   Sweden1 !s undertaken to build and to pay for the southern sector and has sent 10 000[21173] c
workmen for the purpose. The Finns have repaired 200 Russian tanks and formed a Tank Corps. They have also picked up 750 Russian aircraft. though there is no definite evidence on the point, the Finns believe that German officersmust have directed the February offensive, as the Russian tactics were of theGerman drill pattern.The Finns are beginning to feel that they won a victory in preserving their independence. They are grateful to the Allies, as they think that it was the threat of Allied intervention which decided the Russians to treat for peace.Far East.31. The Japanese have withdrawn from Wuyuan, their advanced post inthe Suiyuan province of Inner Mongolia. In Central China the Japanese alsoadmit the withdrawal of certain of their forward detachments in the Machengregion, 60 miles north-east of Hankow, and from west and south of Nanchang.In this latter area the Chinese claim successes between the 4th and 13th Aprilin heavy fighting to the north and north-west of the Kiangsi provincial capitalAccording to Chinese reports their forces are advancing on Nanchang, and japanese land and water communications with the city have been cut. Partialwithdrawals of Japanese troops are known to have taken place in the area ofNorthern Kiangsi concerned; it may well be, therefore, that the Chinese arere-occupying villages and towns formerly held by the Japanese, and to some extentharrying rear guards and small detachments. The significance of the reports lieschiefly in the indication they give of Chinese determination to continue thestruggle.In the Nanning area, it seems probable that the Japanese who have cleared the neighbourhood consider it would be inadvisable to engage in larger operationswith the two and a half divisions at their disposal. They have, however, bombedPingma, an important junction on the newly-constructed road across the Indo-China border. This road runs roughly parallel to and some 100 miles north ofthe road Langson-Nanning and was constructed partly to circumvent the Japanesevooupdtivil ut  unc itXLtci uj.lv.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.The Scandinavian Operations [Bomber and Coastal Commands).32. No contact was made with enemy heavy naval units on Thursday, the11th April. Six Hampdens sent out for an attack on warships at KristiansandSouth were unable to reach their objective and two Blenheims despatched to search the Wilhelmshaven area could not penetrate as far as this base. The lattertwo aircraft bombed two small naval auxiliaries off Norderney. Further north,continuous reconnaissance was maintained up the West coast of Norway. one aircraft reported an enemy troopship off Utyoer Light. A striking force of bombers was sent to attack it, but failed to re-establish contact.In addition two destroyers were sighted and bombed fifty miles E.S.E.of the Lister Light, and one small destroyer was attacked with machine-gunfire from 500 feet in the entrance to the Bergen Fjord.The harbours at Bergen and Kristiansand South were reconnoitred, in face of considerable anti-aircraft fire, and were seen to be full of merchant shipping&apos;A ship flying the German flag and bearing Swedish markings was bombed and machine-gunned at Bergen. One enemy submarine was sighted about 100 milesfrom the coast. In the course of the day, four Dornier flying-boats were encountered and attacked by aircraft of Coastal Command; one was seen tocome down on the water and sink, and two others were seriously damaged.Towards dusk on the 11th Stavanger aerodrome was raided by six Wellingtonsand two Blenheim fighters; the latter flew low over the aerodrome shortly beforethe arrival of the bombers, and sprayed it with machine-gun fire. At leastfour Junkers bombers were hit and others damaged, and there appeared to beabout twenty casualties among enemy ground personnel. The Wellingtonsfollowed with a low-level bombing attack, which started a large fire. They alsomachine-gunned the aerodrome and the seaplane base in the Fjord. Intenseanti-aircraft fire was encountered, and one Wellington failed to return.
33. During the night, the llth-12th, forty-three aircraft were sent out toattack shipping on the route from Kiel to Oslo and many bombs were dropped on vessels in convoy; observation of results was difficult in the darkness, but one ship was seen to explode with great violence. All our aircraft returned safelywith the exception of one Whitley, which came down in the sea off the Englishcoast.34. On the morning of the 12th April air reconnaissance located the enemyforce referred to in paragraph 4 under Naval Operations, and a striking forceof ninety-two bombers was despatched to attack it. Clouds and visibility werelow and the enemy force was not located. One formation of bombers attackedtwo warships at Kristiansand South and encountered heavy A.A. fire and fighteropposition. Ten of our aircraft in all failed to return; two Messerschmitt 110&apos;were seen to be shot down and another seriously damaged. The German wirelesshas admitted the loss of five Messerschmitt 109&apos;s.Results of air reconnaissances off this coast have been described in the navalsection.35. On Saturday, the 13th April, six aircraft attacked objectives in theneighbourhood of Stavanger aerodrome at intervals during the morning; the weather conditions were unfavourable. During these attacks two Hudsons were engaged by two Messerschmitt 110&apos;s, one of which was shot down and the otherdriven off, apparently damaged. A visit was also paid to Kristiansand South,where two cruisers were seen at anchor, and a considerable number of aircraft were on the aerodrome or moored nearby. Heavy anti-aircraft fire was encountered.Nine Blenheims took off during the morning with the intention of attackingenemy forces in the Heligoland Bight and off the Danish coast, but weather conditions prevented them operating effectively. Two auxiliary vessels 100 miles west of Horns Reef, which fired at our aircraft, were attacked with bombs and machine-gun fire.Hudson aircraft engaged in reconnaissance of the Norwegian coast were attacked on several occasions by Messerschmitt 110 fighters, and one of the latter is believed to have been brought down in flames.During the night of the 13th-14th April, fifteen Hampdens operated in theKattegat-Kiel area; one aircraft came down in the sea during the return flight.36. On the l&amp;th April eight aircraft searched the Heligoland Bight and thenorth-west German coast for enemy warships; conditions were unfavourable, andnothing of importance was seen. Two submarines were sighted off the norwegian coast and one of them was bombed, with uncertain results. Stavanger aerodromewas raided twice, once at dawn and once just after dusk. During the first attack,fourteen 250 lb. bombs were dropped from a low altitude by three Wellingtons;bombs fell on one of the runways and it is probable that several Heinkel lll&apos;sand a hangar were damaged. Many rounds were fired at machine-gun nests.About twenty seaplanes and flying boats were seen at moorings in Stavangerharbour. Two out of four aircraft sent out in the evening did not reach the objective. The others dropped high explosive and incendiary bombs, damaged ahangar, and put out a searchlight by machine-gun fire. One of these aircraftfailed to return.During the night of the 14th-15th April twenty-eight aircraft operated overthe area of the Great and Little Belts; visibility was bad. One aircraft is missing, and two crashed on the return flight.37. On Monday, the Ibth April, offensive operations against Stava,ngeraerodrome were resumed by day and night bombers. All aircraft returned safely.Eleven bombers went out during the day, and reached the objective in low cloud and a thick snowstorm; bombs were dropped on the seaplane anchorage as wellas on the aerodrome. Two seaplanes were seen to sink and several were damaged,ine night-bombing attack was completed by seven aircraft, with incendiary as a high-explosive bombs, and fires were started near the control tower and among the parked aircraft; anti-aircraft fire was ineffective., Hudson aircraft on reconnaissance toward Lillesand was attacked bywo Messerschmitt 110&apos;s and suffered slight damage.  One of the German fighters,wmch dived through low cloud, is believed to have hit the ground.    Another-ttuason on reconnaissance in the same area failed to return.   Bergen was alsouccesslully reconnoitred.  No enemy activity was apparent.   Two destroyers of[21173] &quot; c 2
the &apos;&apos; Maas&apos;&apos; class were seen by aircraft at various times during the day in aposition about sixty miles off the Norwegian coast, heading south, and were bombed and machine-gunned. Two Flak ships seen in the Skagerrak were also attacked.In the course of the day, a Sunderland aircraft conveying army officers pr0.ceeded to the Namsen Fjord to rendezvous with a British naval unit. Both theship and the aircraft were repeatedly bombed by several enemy aircraft. Someinjury was done to the Sunderland by machine-gun fire, and one of its passengerswas wounded.During the night 15th-16th six Beauforts operated in the Jade Estuary(one failed to complete the return flight).38. At dawn on the lQth April six Blenheims were sent to raid stavanger aerodrome. Conditions were such that only one aircraft was able to reach the objective and drop its bombs; about sixty aircraft were seen on the aerodrome.An evening raid by twelve heavy bombers again found very bad weather con-ditions on the Norwegian coast, and though two of them flew low over the aerodrome, it was not possible to drop bombs. Night-bombing raids were alsodespatched against aerodromes near Oslo and near Trondhjem. The three air-craft engaged on the former penetrated as far as Drammen on the Oslo Fjord andobserved great activity in the docks there. The raid on Trondhjem aerodromewas more successful, though conditions were bad. Bombs were dropped onVaernes aerodrome and seaplane base, and fires were started.Reconnaissances penetrated to Wilhelmshaven, where no warships were seen,except the Tirpitz and two submarines, and to Bergen and other points on theNorwegian coast. The Bergen railway was seen to be cut by the demolition of a bridge ten miles North of the town. Two U-Boats were attacked duringthe course of the day.39. At dawn on the 17th April an aircraft was despatched to Stavanger toco-operate in the bombardment by FOES. Suffolk. The aircraft bombed the aerodrome before commencing to spot. One attack on the aircraft was made by aJunkers 88 and there was some light anti-aircraft fire. Escorts were laterprovided for H.M.S. Suffolk, during her return to Scapa (see paragraph 9).Stavanger aerodrome was again attacked by twelve Blenheims at about midday.On the outward journey three of the Blenheims turned as if to attack 7 Heinkelswhich, accompanied by a number of Messerschmitt 109&apos;s, were attacking four british destroyers. Some of the Heinkels took cover in the clouds. All theBlenheims bombed their objective, hits being secured among aircraft dispersedround the aerodrome. A determined attack was made by Messerschmitt 109 and110 fighters, the combat lasting for 65 minutes. Trie aerodrome was againattacked during the night by 11 Wellingtons, and the concrete runway was hit.Two Blenheims and one Wellington are missing as a result of these operations.Night-bombers were sent out against the aerodrome at Vaernes near Trondhjem,weather conditions preventing them reaching this objective.Twenty-three Hampdens and seven Beauforts were employed during thisnight on operations against German sea communications.One submarine was bombed, with probable success, in the Bergen Fjord, andanother was attacked in the Fair Isle Channel. Bombs were also dropped on a supply ship at Larvik on the South coast of Norway, and there were numerousindecisive encounters with enemy aircraft. Several large merchant ships were reported at Nyborgf jord and Korsor.40. On the morning of the 18th April, a Hudson on patrol saw inHaugesund Harbour one enemy gunboat and a Dornier flying boat, and movingout of the harbour a large Norwegian freighter of 12,000 tons. The Hudson tooksome photographs, but was hit twice by the machine-gun fire of the gunboat.It also saw five merchant vessels leave Bonunel Fjord. Other Hudsons sawan enemy destroyer in Haugesund, and. two small Norwegian vessels inRaege Fjord.41. The routine work of Coastal Command in both the North Sea and inother areas continued in spite of the heavy requirements of the Scandinavianoperations. A total of eight submarines were sighted, four of which were attacked; fifty convoys were escorted, involving 349 aircraft sorties; and therewere 213 other patrols involving 495 sorties.
Fighter Command.42. Until the 17th April enemy activity off our coasts was slight, and was limited to a few meteorological and other reconnaissance flights. During the night of the 17th-18th April there were numerous raids off the South-East coastbetween 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. Fire was opened by ships and fighters were sent up, but no interceptions were made. The usual protection was given to convoys and cross-channel traffic. In all 221 patrols, involving 529 aircraft, were flownduring the week.British Air Forces in France.43. Fighter units in France had a quiet week, and report no combatsthough 53 patrols were despatched.A number of long-distance reconnaissances were flown by aircraft of theAir Component. These included two night reconnaissances to the Munchen-Gladbach district on the night of the lOth-llth April, three daylight visual andphotographic reconnaissances to the Dusseldorf area on the 14th April and a reconnaissance along the Rhine from Wesel to Emmerich on the 15th April.No particular movements except of barge traffic were observed. One of theaircraft engaged on the reconnaissance on the 14th April failed to return, and,from reports received from Holland, it would appear that it was shot downduring an encounter with five enemy fighters and crashed near the Dutch border.AIR INTELLIGENCE.German Air Activity.44. The German Air Force now have at their disposal a number of addi-tional aerodromes, many of which are not, however, suitable for operations bymodern bomber aircraft. There are four in Denmark which could be so employed :  (1) Kastrup, South-East of Copenhagen.(2) Vaerlose, North-East of Copenhagen.(3) Aalborg.(4) Skagen in the North of the Peninsula.In Norway there are also four aerodromes which approach this category:  (1) Kjeller and Fornebu, both near Oslo.(2) Kristiansand South.(3) Stavanger.The two former are believed to be in a poor state of serviceability on account ofmelting snow, but were none the less used for landing German troops.   the aerodromes at Kristiansand South and Stavanger are just under 400 miles andjust under 300 miles, respectively, from the nearest point on the British coast;and Stavanger in particular provides a near base for an attack on Scapa.   the centres of industry and population are not, however, brought within closer range of enemy bases, although the number of operational aerodromes within 600 miles of our coast, from which simultaneous attacks might be delivered, has increased.The Air Forces engaged in the operations are estimated as follows : (1) 250 first-line operational aircraft, bombers and fighters.(2) 100 flying-boats and seaplanes.(3) 250 to 300 transport aircraft of miscellaneous types.These aircraft are drawn from the units normally located in North-western germany, and from others which have recently been moved to this area. Thetotal percentage of the German Air Force involved, including reserve units andreinforcements and those used only for attacks on the British Fleet, does notexceed 12 per cent. The remainder of the German long-range bomber force hascontinued normal training activity at its Stations in Western and South-western germany.   It is at first sight surprising that a larger proportion of the Force
was not used for attacks on the British Fleet off Norway. It must, however,be remembered that even for an Air Force as mobile as that of Germany, a sudden move of large numbers of bombers to the aerodromes m the North-Westwould have involved considerable difficulties. It is possible also that it is thepolicy of the German High Command to keep a large proportion of its long-range bombers solely for operations against land objectives, and to specialiseexperience in attacking shipping in a comparatively small number of units.45. The present disposition of the German Air Force in Norway jsestimated as follows : (1) Oslo-Kjeller-1 Gruppe Heinkel 111.1 Gruppe Junkers 88, and possibly1 Gruppe Junkers 87.(2) Oslo-Fornebu 1 Gruppe mixed Heinkel 111 and Junkers 88.1 Staffel of coastal reconnaissance aircraft.(3) KristiansandS 1 Gruppe Messerschmitt 109.(4) Stavanger 1 Gruppe Heinkel 111.1 Gruppe Messerschmitt 110.1 Coastal Reconnaissance Staffel.(5) Vaernes, near Trondhjem 1 Gruppe Junkers 87.(6) 1 Gruppe Henschel 126 (Army Co-operation) not yet located.(7) About 100 seaplanes distributed along the coastline as far northas Narvik.It is possible that other landing places have been available, in particular on frozenlakes; troop transport aircraft have been used as far as Trondhjem, and possiblyfurther north.46. There has been little German Air Force activity during the week outsidethe area of Scandinavian operations. Normal reconnaissance has been maintainedover France, and two aircraft have been shot down. An unidentified aircraft was reported on the 15th April over the Valley of the Durance in South-EasternFrance; if this was an enemy reconnaissance, its activity may possibly be related to the present attitude of Italy.There have been no offensive operations against British territory or coastal shipping during the week, but a revival of mine-laying activity was reported offthe South-Eastern coast during the night of the 17th-18th April.French Air Activity.47. The only combats during the week&apos; occurred on the 11th April, when one Dornier 17 and one Heinkel 111 were shot down.Reconnaissance has been regularly maintained over the Saar, the Moselle andthe Rhine, with particular. attention to bridge-building operations. A photo-graphic reconnaissance over the Saar on the 13th April showed three new bridgescompleted, five others begun, eight footbridges and two drawbridges completed.A reconnaissance on the Rhine Front on the same day reported work in progress on the construction of casemates on the right bank of the river. Otherreconnaissances confirmed these reports.Scandinavia.48. Norway. The Chief of the Norwegian Air Staff reports that theoccupation of the aerodrome at Stavanger was so rapid that no measures to put it out of action could be taken. Telephonic communications with outlying partsof Norway had already been severed before the Germans occupied Oslo. TheNorwegian Air Force were taken by surprise before they could mobilise, and itis reported that all fighter aircraft, supplies and stores were lost.
49. Denmark. The whole of the Danish Naval Air Service was seized bythe Germans without difficulty. When enemy aircraft arrived over the militaryair station at Vaerlose, such aircraft as were available were drawn up and readyto take off. Two Gloster-Gauntlets which were in the air were shot down andthe pilots killed. The aircraft on the ground were machine-gunned withincendiary bullets and set on fire, and it is estimated that about twenty aircraft were wholly destroyed in this way.50. Sweden. The Swedish Air Force is now being withdrawn from southern Sweden, and is being concentrated in the North. The whole of southern and Western Sweden has been blacked-out and Malmd has been evacuated. Allaerodromes on the West coast are now under guard. Enquiries have been madeof the British Government in regard to the possibility of assembling certainaircraft in England which have been ordered in the United States. It is under-stood that the order includes sixty Seversky single-seater fighters and twentv-four Seversky convoy two-seater fighters.A Swedish officer was recently in Rome for the purpose of negotiating thepurchase by Sweden of the fifty G. 50 fighters which were originally destined for Finland.Italy.51. It is stated by the Italian Air Ministry that the Air Force will have10,000 pilots available in 1941. This, however, includes all pilots on the active and reserve lists, and the strength of operationally trained pilots willprobably not exceed 7,000. A considerable increase in training activity hasbeen noticed in bomber squadrons, and a large amount of night flying, includingnight navigational training over the sea, has been carried out from Lecce.Attention is also being paid to precision and dive-bombing.General Aldo Pellegrini, the Director-General of Italian Civil Aviation, hasmade a number of announcements concerning the programme of the Italian Com-mercial Air Services for the coming year.   These include : (1) The establishment of a service, Rome-Warsaw-Danzig (held up at theoutbreak of war).(2) Establishment of a high-speed service, Rome-Madrid-Lisbon,  as afeeder for the North Atlantic service.(3) Acceleration of the Rome-Addis Ababa service from three to two days.(4) Connection of the Italian air service in East Africa to the junctions at aden and Nairobi.(5) Extension of the Eastern service, Rome-Rhodes-Haifa-Bagdad, as faras Tehran, and beyond it to Bangkok and Tokyo, in conjunction withthe Japanese civil air service.(6) Extension of the air services in South America, connecting with theItalian South Atlantic line from Rome to Rio de Janeiro.It is reported that an aircraft factory is being built in Albania, probably on the outskirts of Tirana, at the request of the Italian Government. This wouldseem to be part of a programme to transfer some of the aircraft production of theFrench frontier region, and to create an aircraft industry in safer localities, inview of the possible conflict in the Alps.Considerable operational activity continues in Italian East Africa. Thirty-eight aircraft were engaged during the week from the 17th to 23rd March, and46,500 lbs. of bombs were dropped. Eleven aircraft took off from Sicily on the morning of the 14th April en route for Italian East Africa, and landed in Libyalater in the day.Bulgaria.52. In a recent interview between ELM. Air Attache at Sofia andGeneral Boideff the Chief of the Bulgarian Air Staff, the latter spoke veryfreely on the building up of the Bulgarian Air Force, which was admittedlybased on the German model, but was not dependent on any German or other foreign mission The only foreigners engaged in work with the Air Force were a few Czech technicians. General Boideff stressed the importance of dispersaland instant readiness, and stated that his aim was to have as many as five hundred
landing gounds available for use in war, and to have, in addition, a number ofsecret landing grounds. The Air Force has been trained to be at their waraerodromes at two hours&apos; notice, and the necessary oil and bomb stocks werestored and ready. It was, if possible, advisable to have no larger unit than halfa squadron at any one landing ground, and a communication system had been evolved with this in view. H.M. Air Attache was taken by the Chief of the AirStaff to see the air port at Bourgas, so that he could obtain first-hand evidencethat no special facilities were being offered to the Soviet Government for their civil air service. The Air Attache was allowed to make a thorough inspection of the whole aerodrome, and was satisfied that nothing abnormal had taken placethere. It .was stated that the Russian aircraft would stop only at Bourgas andSofia, and at no intermediate landing grounds, that there would not be morethan five Russians in Bulgaria connected with the air line, three of whom wouldbe at Bourgas and two at Sofia.The Russian air line has now been officially opened, and the first aircraftarrived from Moscow in Sofia on 23rd March. For the present, the time-tableprovides for two trips each way every month, aircraft leaving Moscow on the10th and 25th, and the return trip being made on the 11th and 26th.
