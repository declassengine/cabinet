SECRET. Copy No. 2 iW.P. (40) 14.9.May 7, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.NORWAY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues, for their information, a record of a con-versation between M. Thomas Olsen, a Norwegian shipowner, and a member ofthe Foreign Office, on the subject of the campaign in Norway, and, in particular,on German bombing in that country.H.Foreign Office, May 7, 1940.AT the request of the Secretary of State I received this afternoon M. ThomasOlsen, a Norwegian shipowner (not to be confused with M. Hysing Olsen), acousin by marriage of Lord Glentanar, who had asked the Secretary of state to see him.M. Olsen, who had just arrived from Aalesund, said that half the difficultiesin the Norwegian campaign had arisen from the obstinate policy of unprepared-ness pursued by M. Koht and the Norwegian Prime Minister; but he implied,though too polite to say so in so many words, that the other half was the fault of the Allies. Nevertheless, he was in favour of carrying on the struggleto the bitter end; and he assured me that the Minister of Defence was of thesame opinion and could be trusted to stand by it in almost any circumstances.M. Olsen said that he had witnessed numerous instances of deliberate german air attacks on civilians, and that, for that reason alone, he could never advocatea compromise with the Germans; but he warned me that, not everyone in Norwaywas of his opinion now. His last words were, a propos of German bombing : &quot; Tellyour people here not to be so afraid of bombs. I have been in places whichhave been bombed for days and no one was killed. The Germans are very badshots with their bombs and not brave when they meet other aeroplanes.&quot;L. COLLIER.May 6, 1940.11020   [21254]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1940.
