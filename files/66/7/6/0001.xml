REPORT BY THE CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE.At yesterday&apos;s Meeting of the Military Co-co-ordination committee the Chiefs of Staff were asked to examine what our action should he if Germany demanded hases from holland on the Estonian model.2.     The Chiefs of Staff consider that if the germans were to obtain naval and/or air bases in Holland a step would have been   takers which would directly threaten our .vital interests as would be the case if Germany invadedHolland,3.     A reply has now &quot;been received from General Gamelinsaying that he agrees in principle with the Chiefs of Staffrecommendation that in the event of an invasion of Holland5and the Belgians do not invite our assistance, the AlliedArmy should advance forthwith into Belgium.4.     This question is, therefore, now cleared up on theHigh Command level.     There remains the question of air policy.5.     At present in the event of an invasion of Hollandit would not be our policy to initiate air attack onobjectives in Germany.     The Chiefs of Staff now consider,however, that air attack on certain types of military objectives, delivered at the decisive moment,  just before an attack develops, might have a very great effect onits success.      But, unless we have a clear understanding with the French, it will be too late to consult them andto take decisions when the time comes.

6. The Chiefs of Staff, therefore, recommend that theFrench Government should he informed as a matter of theutmost urgency, on the diplomatic level, in the following terms -(a) We consider an attack on the Low countries and/or the Maginot Line to he imminent..(b) We understand that the French think so too..(c) We. rely upon the French to give us full and immediate information as soon as theyare certain that an attack is going to be launched, and this by all precedent shouldbe possible at least twenty-four hours before.(d) As soori as this information is received,we propose that the following military action should be taken on the night beforethe attack is due to commence without further reference to our respective Governments.i       &quot; -(i) The Allied Army should advance into belgium.(ii) We should attack with air forces at nightthe following military objectives inGermany -Troop concentrations,marshalling yards,communications, and oil refineries in the Ruhr..(iii) Royal Marine operation should be put intoeffect.7,     The Chiefs of Staff wish to emphasise the urgency of this matter and the vital importance which they attach to it.Richmond Terrace, 8.
