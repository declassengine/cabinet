Naval Intelligence Division.&apos;1130/13th May, 1940.Telegram from H.M.R. Belgrade timed 1900/lSth Mayand NglyDj Comments.(a) Italy is preparing a coup againstAlexandria to be effected mainly by submarine action from the dodecanese, where 16 submarinesare now in readiness.(A report through the French  -Naval Attache, Belgrade,increases this number to 40).Alexandria cannot be directlyattacked by submarine, butsubmarine operations in itsvicinity would form a normalpart of any Italian planvAt present there are probablyonly 8 submarines in the dodecanese.&apos;(b) IJsaly hrJ.3 asked Spain for permission to lay minefieldsoff the Coast of Morocco and thence by Alboran Is. to theSpanish coastoThe depths on this line arebetween 300 and 500 fathoms andsuch a minefield would be mostineffectual even if it were possible to lay it, which isvery do^^btful*(o) Germany has agreed to supplycrews to man 14 Italian sub-marines, for which Italy is apparently unable.to findtrained personnel.Very unlikely that Germany canspare these orews, as she isalready diluting her U-boatpersonnel.    No evidence toshow that Italy cannot findcrews for her own submarines.(d) Submarines are to Operate fromthe Balearic Islands, Lampeduzaand Otranto.The harbours of Lampeduza andOtranto are minute,  quite un-suitable for submarines and haveno facilities.    Operations inwar time from the Balearics are possible, which has always beenenvisaged if the Spanish allowit.   Recent reports from Spainindicate that the Spaniardswould resist such an incursion.(e) On May 11th, Italy beganfitting guns to merchant vesselsalready strengthened for thispurpose.It has been assumed for someyears that a. number of Italianmerchantmen carry their gunsconcealed, so no particularsignificance can be attached tothis reportoYugoslavia has, in the past, been used by the Germans and italians for spreading false reports, of which the above istypical-   Although portions of it cannot be discounted, the probability is that this report,, which is drafted in a most un-professional manner, has been spread via th the object of drawing of four light forces to the Mediterranean.JOHN H. GODFREYDIRECTOR OF NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.
