We submit below a summary of our conclusions, together with certain important recommendations. We attach as an Annex to this report the broadreview from which these have been drawn.CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.2. On the assumption that Germany has decided to seek a decision in 1940,we sum up in the following terms: (a) The most likely method by which she might attempt to achieve thisobject is by a major offensive against Great Britain (paragraph 9).(b) The main threat to the United Kingdom is an intensive air offensivewhich, if successful, might culminate in an attempt at actual invasion.An enemy occupation of the Low Countries would seriously increase this threat (paragraphs 10-15).(c) The occupation of Danish and Norwegian bases has increased the scale of attack on our naval forces and shipping, and an occupation of theLow Gountries would still further increase it (paragraph 16).(d) To meet the air threat there are serious deficiencies in A.A. guns andin fighter and bomber aircraft (paragraphs 17 and 21).(e) We cannot ignore the possibility of the main German attack being directed against France. In this event we estimate that there areat present sufficient land forces to maintain the security of french territory against both Germany and Italy, if adequate air protection and support is provided. In the latter respect the deficiencies infighter and bomber aircraft referred to above are also serious(paragraphs 18-21).[21204]B
(f) Our policy in the event of a German offensive against the Low countries has already been decided. The question of whether we should be thefirst to violate the territorial air of the Low Countries, if, in their attck on this country, the Germans have not already done so, is one that is receiving further examination (paragraphs 23, 24i and 25).(g) The effect of the German control of Denmark and Southern Norway willnot in itself be decisive, but it may be the first stage in a major planthat aims at a decision this year (paragraph .29).-(h) If we are correct in thinking that Germany intends to seek a decisionthis year, the corollary is that we shall have to undertake an air offensive against Germany some time during the coming months. our strategic policy and military preparations, both for offence and defence,should, therefore, be based on this assumption.(i) Denial of the Swedish iron ore to Germany is the primary Allied objective in Scandinavia. Allied strategy in Scandinavia must be governed by the necessity for retaining in readiness adequate forces to counter the main German threat in the West (paragraph 30).(j) In the Balkans, Mediterranean and Middle East Areas we must expectGermany to undertake diversionary action to embarrass us stillfurther, probably with the collaboration of Italy and possibly of spain and Russia. Against such developments our strategy must be mainly defensive, with the possible exception of air attack on Italy&apos;sNorth-Western industrial area (paragraphs 31-38).3.   Accordingly, we recommend: (a) That every possible step, should be taken to hasten the production of anti-aircraft equipment,/particularly Bofors guns/ bomber and fighter aircraft and fully trained crews, even at the temporary expense ofour long-term programme.(b) That every endeavour should be made to induce the Dutch Governmentto give the assurance for which they have been asked that theywill make immediate preparations for the demolition of theiraerodromes in the event of invasion.(c) That the plans already prepared for dealing with invasion of thiscountry should be reviewed forthwith and requirements met. In thisrespect the Ministry of Home Security should be instructed to maintainthe closest touch with the Service Departments.-(d) That active steps should be taken to educate public opinion to the realityof the air threat and to develop to the highest pitch of efficiency ourpassive defence measures.(e) That arrangements for the diversion of shipping to West Coast ports should be placed in a state of immediate readiness. This should be combined with urgent measures drastically to restrict non-essential imports.(f) In view of the seriousness of the situation we submit that, in puttingthese recommendations into effect, financial considerations should notbe allowed to stand in the way.(Signed) C.

SECRET.ANNEX.REVIEW OF THE STRATEGICAL SITUATION ON THE ASSUMPTIONTHAT GERMANY HAS DECIDED TO SEEK A DECISION IN 1940.ON the&apos;26th March, 1940, we submitted our views on certain aspects of thesituation as we then saw it.&apos;* Since then Germany has seized Denmark andinvaded Norway.At the same time Germany has made full use of Italy as a threat to the allies in the Mediterranean area, and Italy is using Spain as an added weight in thesame direction.These moves may be part of a major strategic plan aimed at seeking adecision this year.2. On the other hand, if Germany is not seeking a very rapid decision, itis possible that her strategic plan may develop along the following lines :  (a) The consolidation by the Germans of their position in Denmark and southern Norway, with a view to the economic and military controlof Scandinavia.(b) Attack in the Balka^ns accompanied by simultaneous Italian actionagainst Yugoslavia and possibly Greece.(c) The retention of a large force in the West, containing immobilised thebulk of the Allied forces.(d) Threats by Spain with a view to causing a diversion of our forces.(e) Action by Russia to contain or neutralise Turkey.(/) The severing of our Mediterranean lines of communication.\g) Intensified attack on our seaborne trade.The improvement in the German economic position vis-a-vis the Allies,together with the territorial and strategic gains that Germany may anticipatefrom such a policy, might put her in a position to seek peace terms with somechance of gaining thereby considerable and permanent advantages tantamount to victory. Furthermore, Germany may hope to carry through such a planwithout the heavy losses that a direct land attack in the West might entail.3. We are, however, of the opinion that it is only by direct attack on GreatBritain or France that Germany could win the war this year, and we thereforereview the strategical situation on this supposition, bearing in mind that manyof the factors discussed below are equally applicable to the German policy outlined in paragraph 2 above as to a policy leading to direct attack on GreatBritain or France.Courses that Germany might Adopt to Gain a Decision.4. Broadly there are two ways in which the Germans might attempt toreach a decision this year : (a) By a major attack directed against Great Britain.(b) By a major attack directed against France.A major attack directed against Great Britain.5.   The following method of developing such an attack appears possible : (a) The consolidation by the Germans of their position in Denmark and southern Norway to a point where they are able to make full use ofnaval and air bases in these areas.(b) The invasion of Holland or Belgium or both these countries with a viewto securing further bases from which to attack Great Britain.* W.P. (40) ill.T21204] b 2
(c) A containing attack on the Maginot Line to occupy French attention.(d) The launching of an air offensive aiming at eliminating Great Britain&apos; as an active ally of France.   If successful, the possibility of thisculminating in an attempt at invasion cannot be ruled out.  .6.. Diversions or threats in the Balkans with Italian co-operation, whichmay either precede or accompany the main offensive, may be made. Threats bySpain might also be employed to force further diversion on the Allies, and russia might be encouraged to neutralise Turkey.A major attack directed against France.7.   The following method of developing such an attack appears possible  (a) Aii&apos;attack on the Western Front in full force, supported by the bulk ofthe German air force, combined with (b) Air action to neutralise and contain Allied air forces.8. Diversions elsewhere on the lines described in paragraph 6 above are tobe expected.Most Probable Course.9. Whilst we cannot neglect the possibility of direct attack on France, weconsider that the situation is more likely to develop along the lines outlined inparagraph 5 rather than those in paragraph 7, for the following reasons :  (i) With our defeat France could not stand alone against Germany.(ii) Germany would wish to avoid the heavy losses involved in a full-scale attack on France with the probable repercussions on German morale.(iii) British support in the event of an attack on France is likely to be more effective than French support in the event of an attack on GreatBritain.(iv) By use of her air force alone against this country, Germany will exploither relatively strongest weapon with the least expenditure of life andeconomic resources.Allied Security against Main German Threats.Security of the United Kingdom.10. The main threat to Allied security in the United Kingdom is an intensive air offensive. This might aim, firstly, at neutralising our air forceand aircraft industry as a prelude to wider attacks, culminating in attempts at actual invasion by air-bo.rne or sea-borne expeditions.11. The defence of the United Kingdom itself has now reached a reasonably high standard. It is true that there are serious deficiencies in A.A.guns and our fighter strength, both in first-line and reserve, is still considerablyshort of that considered necessary before the enemy, by his action in Norway,widened the base of his air operations. Nevertheless, our aerodromes are welldesigned for defence and dispersion, and it is doubtful if the enemy could face the casualties to be expected by unescorted attacks in daytime.12. Our defence against night attack is still far from effective, and while we doubt whether Germany could achieve her aims by night bombardment alone,it must be remembered that our passive defence measures cannot be as effectiveby night as by day and morale is most vulnerable during the hours of darkness.13. Occupation of the Low Countries would confer great advantage uponthe Germans, as it would enable them to provide fighter escorts to their bomberformations and to bring their short-range bomber force into action against objectives in S.E. England and in the narrow waters off our South and EastCoasts. In these circumstances we should have to face a very considerable threatsince the effectiveness of our fighter defence would be gravely reduced. Even so,although the enemy attacks would no doubt cause serious material damage anddislocation, We do not think it probable they could achieve the necessary degree
5  iof neutralisation of our air striking force. So long as a striking force is in being to co-operate with our naval forces, no large-scale sea-borne expeditionsagainst this country would be practicable. The bulk of the Allied naval^ forces are engaged, directly or indirectly, in the protection of trade in Home waters and the Atlantic, and in the protection of our military communications with Norway. Our naval strength in Home Waters should be adequate to dispute theenemy securing sufficient control of sea communications to effect and maintain an invasion of Great Britain on a large scale, but if the Germans obtain virtuallycomplete air ascendancy over the narrow seas and adjacent harbours, the Navy&apos;stask would be rendered far more difficult and serious losses must be expected.14. The possibility of raids to destroy vulnerable points must, however,be accepted, and it would be dangerous to ignore the possibility that sea-borneand air-borne attacks with land forces might be attempted at a later stage againstEast Coast areas under the cover of heavy air attack.15. Throughout 1940 there will be sufficient troops in the United kingdom for this purpose, provided they are suitably located. Plans already prepared fordealing instantly with an enemy force landed in this country must be constantlyreviewed, and essential requirements such as transport must be met. In thisconnection the fullest use should be made of the Civil Defence Organisation. .16. By her occupation of Danish and Norwegian bases Germany is now in aposition to bring a more serious scale of attack to bear against our naval forces and shipping in Northern Waters. This danger would be accentuated ifthe enemy were in occupation of the Low Countries which would directly threatenour Channel traffic and communications to France, and involve a threat to theWestern Approaches. We would, nevertheless, stress again the vital importanceof making every possible preparation for the diversion of traffic to Western ports,and of the most drastic reduction of non-essential imports.17. The air defence of Great Britain and the capacity of our long-rangebomber force to strike at decisive objectives within Germany must therefore takethe highest order of precedence. If the assumption that Germany is aiming ata decision in 1940 is accepted, it is vital that every possible step should be takento hasten the production of anti-aircraft equipment, bomber and fighter aircraft and fully trained crews, even at the temporary expense of our long-term programme. We are submitting a separate report to the Military Co-co-ordination committee on the gravity of the Bofors gun position.Security of France.18. It is estimated that Germany can make 160* divisions available for theWestern Front, exclusive of their requirements in Scandinavia and for security in the Greater Reich. Not all of these are fully equipped and trained. This force could be backed by the bulk of the German bomber force, though a proportion ofit, by virtue of Germany&apos;s central position, could be switched to the attack of theUnited Kingdom to contain our forces.19. The main German attack, following their practice of using their Armyand Air Force in close collaboration, would probably be accompanied by air opera-tions intended to neutralise Allied air forces in France. A heavy scale of air attack would then be launched witih the object of isolating the battlefield,preventing the move of Allied reinforcements and supplies, and destroyingHeadquarters and communications.20. There are now 104* Allied Divisions in France, including 10 british divisions. With this strength, France should be reasonably secure against landattack by both Germany and Italy, if adequate air protection and support isprovided.21. There are 648 Allied fighter aircraft in France and provision is madefor.despatching another four British squadrons (64 aircraft) from the UnitedKingdom, if the situation in this country permits, t   We cannot be certain that* This figure excludes Fortress troops.. , &apos;: ,,. .f At present, it.would not be possible to provide more than two squadrons if we send two squadrons of Hurricanes to Norway.
this is adequate effectively to cover both the Army front and French vital centres.Nevertheless, it seems probable that existing strengths are sufficient to deny theenemy the full advantages of air superiority over the Army front alone. defeat of the enemy thrust will, however, necessitate the collaboration of bomber squadrons to delay and dislocate his advance. The bomber squadrons of theBritish air forces in France are inadequate for this purpose, and it would benecessary to utilise a proportion of the limited resources of the Bomber Command.The wastage to be expected in these circumstances is high, and in view of theimportance of retaining some means of striking at objectives within Germany,the small size of our bomber forces is a serious weakness.Action to Meet Eventualities.German air offensive against United Kingdom.22. It is improbable that Germany would open an unrestricted air offensive against Great Britain until she had secured a favourable strategic position by a forward move into Holland. Such a move would offer great advantages toGermany although it would facilitate our counter-measures by giving germany wider front to defend. Even if an enemy air offensive were to commencewithout an invasion of the Low Countries, it would be essential to initiate at onceone of our major air plans for action against Germany. &quot;We should as far aspossible, therefore, conserve our striking force to counter any enemy action whichwe consider may be decisive.23. The Supreme War Council have agreed that in the event of a German,invasion of Holland, the Allied Armies should at once advance into Belgium,without further consultation between the Allied Governments and irrespective of the attitude which the Belgian Government might adopt in the eventualityunder consideration.24. The Supreme War Council have also agreed that in the event of aGerman aggression against Holland, or against Belgium, or against both thesecountries, the British Air Force should be authorised, without further consultation between the Allied Governments, or the Allied High Commands, immediately to attack marshalling yards and oil refineries in the Ruhr.25. One important decision which will have to be made, is whether,,in attacking Germany, it would be in our interests to be the first to violate dutch and Belgian territorial air, if, in their attack on this country, the Germans havenot already done so. This subject has not yet been discussed in the Supreme WarCouncil and is now being examined by the Air Staff.German off ensive directed against the Western Front.26. In the event of a German air offensive on France the British air striking force would open immediate attacks on objectives in Germany. If,however, the enemy attacks coincided with a major land offensive against theMaginot Line a proportion of our bombers would operate in direct support ofthe Armies while our heavy bomber force attacked objectives in Germany.27. Action in the case of a German move through the Low Countries wouldbe as in paragraphs 23, 24 and 26 above.Scandinavia.28.   The Allied objects in intervening in Scandinavia were: (a) to implement the assurance we had given to Norway to go to herimmediate assistance and thus influence other neutrals;(b) to convert the invasion of Norway into the maximum embarrassment anddiversion of effort for Germany without dangerously weakening our essential security elsewhere;(c) to take advantage of any opportunity to deny the passage of iron-ore toGermany.
29. The effects of the rapid German advance northward from Oslo and theheavy scale of air attack that Germany has been able to bring to bear on our forces in Norway are well known and have resulted in certain decisions by theWar Cabinet. We have already given our views on the effects of German controlof Denmark and Southern Norway.* These effects, though a serious blow to our strategic position, cannot be considered in themselves as decisive, though theymay be the first stage in a plan that aims at a decision this year. Whether or not we should take early direct action against Germany on this assumption is a matter that must be further considered.30. As regards our action in Norway, events have been moving with suchrapidity that we do not propose to put forward in this paper any specific recommendation. Denial of the Swedish iron ore is the primary objective of the Allies. If, after further examination, it seems possible to stop thisreaching Germany, we must concentrate upon doing so. But in any event, Alliedstrategy in Scandinavia must be governed by the necessity of retaining in readiness adequate forces to counter the main German threat in the West. Weare examining in a separate paper the strategic implications of our position inthe Narvik area in relation to our chances of stopping the export of the ore toGermany.Balkans.31. If the Germans create a diversion in the Balkans, Allied counter-measures would be dependent upon the attitude of Italy at the time.32. With Italy hostile or even with Italy in her present frame of mind our action must be confined to the securing of our own vital interests in theMediterranean, and no forces could be made available to take the offensive. allied forces for assistance to Turkey would be restricted to such as could be maintained by the Anatolian railways, and could probably be most easily provided by theFrench from Syria, perhaps with the small British token force from the middle east. On the other hand, forces could not be made available to assist to any material extent the resistance of Yugoslavia or Greece to a German advance.33. In the unlikely event of the neutrality of Italy being assured, the forces which we could make available would be limited by the need for security in Franceand at home. The immediate assistance to Turkey envisaged in the existing planscould be provided and the occupation of Salonika by French forces, as a stiffeningto Yugoslav resistance, would be a possibility.In the event of a German move into Roumania, it is exceedingly unlikely thatwe could afford her any direct assistance.Allied Strategy in event of Italian Intervention.34. The entry of Italy into the war during 1940 would, at any rate onthe short-term view, add greatly to our difficulties. Every effort both by diplomacy,propaganda and the use of deterrent measures should be employed to induce her to xemain neutral. In a recent report we expressed the view that we could not afford to acquiesce in any Italian aggression in the Balkans. Since this recom-mendation was made the War Cabinet I have decided- &apos;&apos; that in the event of Italy committing an act of aggression against Yugo-slavia within, say, the next 24 hours, we should not immediately declare war on Italy.&quot;35. The occupation of the Balearics by Italy with Spanish connivance without either Italy or Spain declaring themselves openly hostile to us wouldbe an added threat to the Allied sea communications in the Mediterranean andour control of Gibraltar : but we consider that this alone should not be acasus belli.36. Land forces other than air defences available in the Mediterraneanare adequate to ensure the security of our vital interests in the Mediterranean* W.P. (39) 179.t CCS. (40) 303.% W.M. (40) 105th Conclusions, Minute 7.
and Red Sea. Air forces in these areas are at present dangerously weak but our naval forces in the Eastern Mediterranean have been strengthened. In the red sea additional anti-aircraft and anti-submarine escorts would have to be providedfor the protection of supplies and reinforcement of our Middle East forces.Even when these deficiencies had been made good our resources, would be insufficient to take the offensive. Nevertheless, we would be exerting economic pressure on Italy, cutting her communications with Italian East Africa, and indue course there should be opportunities for local offensives in Italian EastAfrica and by the French in Libya. In view of the particularly vulnerable natureof Italy&apos;s north-west industrial area to air attack, it is considered that we shouldbe prepared to initiate such an attack if circumstances permitted, but on theassumption on which this paper is written, it is unlikely that the necessary airforces will be available.With this possible exception, therefore, our strategy vis-a-vis Italy would, inthe initial stages, be mainly defensive.Spanish or Russian Intervention.37. In the event of Spain adopting a threatening attitude, combined withItalian hostility, it will be essential for reasons of prestige to hold Gibraltar,though it would be unusable as a naval base and our control over the western mediterranean would therefore be weakened. We are examining the implications of Spanish hostility, including the question of the attitude which should beadopted by Portugal, in a separate paper.38. In the event of Russian intervention the only effective offensive actionwhich we could take would be to attack the Caucasian oil. In the condition weare now considering, we could not spare the necessary aircraft from the WesternTheatre. Even if this were possible, Italian hostility would prevent such an operation being staged, and if Turkey remained neutral we should be unable toreach the Caucasus or operate in the Black Sea.
