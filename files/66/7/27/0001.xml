CABINEToEVACUATION OF FAMILIES - MALTA AND&apos; GIBRALTAR.Report &quot;by the Chiefs of__S.ta.gg___Car.committee,The War Cabinet at their meetings on 28th Aprils and30th April4&quot; had under cor.2ictor-atlon the evacuation of the families of the services from Malta and Gibraltar and of thesurplus civilian population from Gibraltar.      In order toenable this evacuation to take place the War Cabinet agreedthat the necessary shipping should be held available againstthe need arising, but that no action should be taken untilorders were issued by the War Cabinet themselves.2. Consequently the following.ships are now heldindefinitely:H.M.T. Devonshire at iialta.HoM0T. Lancashire at Malta0H0MoTo Dilwara at Gibraltar.3. As a result? reinforcements for the Middle East whichwere to have used this shipping have had to be held back.These reinforcements,, which consist mainly of drafts to bringunits up to strength, total seme 7^650 men of whom 1,300 arealready in Franc3, and there is no prospect of their journeybeing completed unless the necessary shipping is released.k. It must be remembered that our forces in the middle east will themselves be engaged in active operations in theevent of war against Italy and are therefore in urgent need of these reinforcements.5. We therefore recommend: -(a) that the shipping referred to in paragraph above shotild be released,,(b) that if the situation yis-a-visitors Italy should become serious, the question of providingshipping for1 evacuation of fami3.ies at malta and Gibraltar should be considered, prioritybeing given to the requirements at Gibraltar.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND,(t J.G.
