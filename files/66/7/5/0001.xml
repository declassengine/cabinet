S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT .Printed for the War Cabinet.   Ap)$l 1940.secret.P. (40) 125.April 8, 1940TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AMD KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ARMS FOR FINLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AT the War Cabinet meeting on the 15th March (War Cabinet 69 (40) Con-clusion 5) it was decided that the Foreign Office should find out from theFrench Government what action they had taken or proposed to take in orderto secure the return of French war material despatched to Finland. The FrenchGovernment have now informed us that they are allowing the Finns to retainall war material already delivered or in transit, with the exception of twelveaircraft which were in Scotland at the time of the signing of the Soviet-FinnishTreaty, and which have been returned to France. The French Government arealso allowing the instructors who accompanied the material to remain at thedisposal of the Finnish authorities.2. Before this information was available, the Service Departments drewup lists showing what material they would particularly like to have back from finland; but, as we should no doubt wish to keep in step with the French inthis matter, and as any other policy would give great offence in Finland, weshall presumably now not ask for the return of any of the items in those lists.3. As regards the general policy to be pursued, in future, in connexionwith the supply of arms to Finland, it may be noted that whether Finland isconsidered as an ordinary neutral to whom we would be prepared to sell forcash any armaments not required here, or whether she remains in the category of Turkey, Portugal, Egypt, Afghanistan, &amp;c, which can place arms ordershere on credit, orders can only be given for material which is not urgently requiredhere. Our own shortage of supplies, in fact, makes the question somewhatacademic and it therefore seems hardly worth while to offend the Finns by takingthem out of the credit category.4. There is, however, one particular case to which attention might be drawnm case the Finnish Minister should mention it on his return, namely, the questionof the order for 220 tons of cartridge cups. It will be remembered that the finns placed this order here early last year and that ft should have been com-pleted by last September, but that owing to our own war the Finns agreed toa postponement of delivery for one or two months. When, in January, BrigadierLing reported that there was an urgent need for small arms ammunition in finland, it was decided to allow Imperial Chemical Industries to make this10970   [21114]Copy No.
material. It is understood that, although none of it was shipped from thiscountry before the end of the Finnish war, 50 tons were waiting to be sentand are still here. These cups, which are of Finnish calibre, would have to bemelted down before the brass could be of any use to us. As this is a pre-warorder and as our failure to supply arms to anyone is beginning to cause doubts about our real strength, there would seem to be a strong case for asking theFinnish Minister if his Government still want this material, and, if so, allowing the 50 tons, at least, to go.H.Foreign Office, April 8; 1940.
