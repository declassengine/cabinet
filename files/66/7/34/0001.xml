THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   May 1940.SECRET.WrCopy No-.TO BB KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SITUATION IN PORTUGAL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN accordance with my proposal, recorded in War Cabinet Conclusions(113/40) of the 6th May, I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum on thesituation in Portugal.The memorandum is rather full, but a summary of the situation is containedin paragraph 10, and certain points suggested for examination are contained inparagraph 11.H.Foreign Office, May 11, 1940.SITUATION IN PORTUGAL.AT the outbreak of war it was decided that it would be in the best interestsof this country that Portugal should follow the precedent of 1914 and should remain neutral, while refraining from making any declaration of neutrality. ThePortuguese Government, in fact, decided to maintain neutrality, but Dr. Salazaremphasised that he was anxious to assist His Majesty&apos;s Government in any way possible and made it clear that he would welcome any suggestions in this sensewhich we might desire to put forward from time to time. Relying on this assurancea number of requests were made to the Portuguese Government, all of which, with one exception, were granted.2. At the beginning of this year the Portuguese Government became lessforthcoming, and of a number of further requests made by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment only one was rather grudgingly granted. Negotiations for a war trade agreement with the Portuguese Government led to no result. Shortly before thisan Italo-Portuguese Trade Agreement, providing for very large increases in thevolume of trade between the two countries, was signed. It also became apparent that Portugal might be a considerable gap in our contraband control system, moreparticularly in the matter of air services.3. In these circumstances an attempt was made to clarify Anglo-Portugueserelations, and advantage was taken of a personal message from Dr. Salazar tothe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs concerning the supply of arms to portugal to remind Dr. Salazar of the attitude which he had taken up at thebeginning of the war and to enquire whether their attitude had changed. On the13th March Dr. Salazar reaffirmed, in writing, his previous attitude and said11026   [21272]
that the Portuguese Government would give &apos;&apos; all attention, and most favourable consideration to anything which, within the limits of benevolent neutrality, mightbe of service to the British Government.&quot;4. On the 12th March the Chiefs of Staff reviewed the position arising fromthe attitude of Portugal. They concluded that, so long as the main strategic requirements of a neutral Portugal continued to be fulfilled, the advantages whichwould be gained from the use of Portuguese bases would be outweighed by thedefence commitments which would be required. On strategic grounds therefore the continued neutrality of Portugal would be in our best interests and no action should be taken which might precipitate a situation likely to lead to Spanishintervention or which could be turned to German advantage. All possible meansof pressure in the diplomatic and economic spheres should, however, be exercised in order to persuade Portugal to accept reasonable demands, and German pressureshould be vigorously countered.5. One of the points which the Portuguese Government has never ceased to stress is the failure of His Majesty&apos;s Government to supply them with the arms in which they stand so vitally in need. This point was strongly put byDr. Salazar in his recent message, and it is undoubtedly his view that Portugalcannot be expected to compromise its neutrality and antagonise the enemies ofthe United Kingdom until provision has been made for her defence. Portugalis virtually defenceless, it has a long frontier, its army is small and poorlyequipped, and it is almost devoid of anti-aircraft defence. Further attention was therefore given to the supply of war material to Portugal, and it was finallyfound possible to make available for Portugal some Spitfire aircraft orderedbefore the war, of which the delivery had been delayed, and also to commencethe supply of anti-aircraft guns, mostly for the defence of Lisbon. We have,however, had to refuse a number of requests from the Portuguese Governmentfor equipment for their army.6. Early this month the Ministry of Economic Warfare decided to makea further effort to secure a satisfactory war trade agreement. It was suspectedthat the contraband traffic, particularly by air, had been greatly developed, andthat, while some improvement as regards seaborne traffic could be effected bythe imposition of certificates of origin and by the adoption of the Navicert system and other measures, this would not affect the vital question of air services, theonly sure remedy for which was for the Portuguese Government to co-operate with us in exercising contraband control in the Azores, the Cape Verde Islands,and on the mainland. The absence of control in the islands means that thereis unhindered passage for enemy mails and contraband carried to and from america by neutral air services, and the lease to the Italian Government of abase in the Island of Sal in the Cape Verdes will enable this traffic to be developed. The possibility of controlling air traffic between Germany and theJL*chancellor peninsula has recently been under consideration, but presents almostinsuperable difficulties.7. A representative of the Ministry of Economic Warfare is now in Lisbonwith the object of exploring the ground, and, thereafter, of negotiating anagreement which should, if possible, include provision for the control of theair services. Our only important bargaining counter was Portuguese dependence on the United Kingdom for coal supplies, and it was always anticipated that thePortuguese might either refuse to meet our requirements as regards contraband control on the grounds that it would involve departure from their neutrality, or,alternatively, that they would request greatly increased supplies of arms and war materials as a condition of compliance.8. Before negotiations could start events in Norway had their effect in portugal, and the Ministry of Economic Warfare representative and Sir W.Selby have both given the preliminary opinion that the Portuguese Governmentwould never agree to meet our maximum demands and that, if sufficient importance is attached to them, it will be necessary to occupy the country. Sir W. Selbyhas said that in general we cannot look forward to any appreciable Portugueseco-operation until we have convinced the Portuguese that we could assume their protection by land, sea, and especially by air, from the Portuguese air bases.
Before Sir W. Selby&apos;s proposal is further examined, the Ministry of economic warfare representative has been instructed to carry his preliminay soundingsrather further, and the Ministry of Economic Warfare are endeavouring toestimate the effect on our war effort of the gap in the blockade which Portugalrepresents.9. Meanwhile, the position has been complicated by rumours circulating inLisbon as to a possible movement against the regime.engineered by German andItalian influences. These rumours are taken very seriously by the French embassy in Lisbon, but it has the reputation of being excitable and alarmist. There isa certain amount of discontent in Portugal, though it is not vocal or importantat present. Dr. Salazar has been in power for many 3rears and there are indica-tions that some elements in Portugal would be glad of a change. His stringentfinancial policy has also caused discontent, and the cost of living is high. ThePortuguese Government contains, notably in the person of the Minister of marine, individuals whose sympathies lie with Germany and Italy rather than with the Allies, and the pro-British elements in Portugal would be glad to see their removal. Italian&quot; and German propaganda is intensely active, and isconcerned to encourage every movement of discontent, even though it is ostensiblya pro-British movement, in order to provoke a reaction against us or interven-tion from Spain. We are charged with fomenting discontent, and rumours are circulated that we intend to occupy Portuguese territory. In Portugal, as elsewhere, the local Germans are well organised and extremely active. It hasbeen suggested that, in view of the weakness of the Portuguese armed forces, itwould be possible for a coup to be engineered, which would result in a pro-AxisGovernment, or in certain circumstances a Spanish intervention with Germanand Italian connivance. The attitude of Spain is, in these circumstances, very important. The Portuguese are haunted by the fear of Spanish aggression,which they know they could not successfully resist. At the moment, however,relations between Portugal and Spain and most cordial, and, unless general franco&apos;s Administration is undermined by German and Italian influence, it is unlikely that the Spaniards would invade Portugal. This conclusion wouldprobably hold good, whatever might or might not be the attitude of Italy, and whatever political change might take place in Portugal, always provided thatthis did not involve the threat of communism.10. To sum up.The rumours of a coup in Portugal are at the moment exaggerated. So long-as Italy is non-belligerent and General Franco maintains himself in power, a movement against the Salazar regime is unlikely to take place. Dr. Salazarhimself, basing his opinion on that attitude of General Franco, and his estimateof Italian policy, is disposed to minimise the danger to Portugal. But it is clearthat, if the situation changes, the Germans in Portugal, assisted no doubt by theGermans in Spain and aided and abetted by the Italians, might well be able to initiate such a movement, and Dr. Salazar himself sees a danger in a change ofGovernment in Spain. It is therefore desirable to consider whether there are any means by which a development so unfavourable to our interests can be averted.So long as Portugal remains relatively defenceless, we cannot expect any markeddegree of co-operation from the Portuguese Government on matters affecting the prosecution of the war, and recent events will greatly increase their reluctance to compromise their neutral position. Nor can we be free from anxiety that apolitical change may be engineered to our disadvantage by German and Italianinfluence.Points suggested for Examination.11. In addition to the question of how far Portugal represents a gap inthe blockade, the following suggestions are tentatively put forward for considera-tion by the Chiefs of Staff and competent departments : (1) In the diplomatic field, that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Lisbon mightbe instructed to speak seriously to Dr. Salazar about the dangers from within, not only from local Quislings, but also from the Germans at large in Portugal, and urge^^MttJiaJiake all measures necessary toprovide for internal security.
(2) That all preparations should be made for seizing strategic points in theGape Verde Islands and the Azores in the event of trouble. Thereis little doubt that the Germans are making preparations also for thispurpose, notably in the case of the British cable station in the island of Fayal.(3) That the Intelligence Service in Portugal should be strengthened. Theinformation that we get as to German and Italian activities inthe country and&quot; as to the currents of opinion in Portugal itself is rather meagre.(4) That steps be taken to organise the British communities in Portugal both for intelligence purposes in so far as that is possible, and also for possible combined action in the event of civil disturbances.(5) That Portugal should be placed higher on the priority list for supplyof equipment for the Portuguese army, and also that she might besupplied, at as early a date as possible, with more Spitfires or otherfighter aircraft. The arguments in favour of such action would be :(a) the political necessity of strengthening Dr. Salazar&apos;s hand if heis to take action desired by His Majestys Government which mightcompromise his neutrality, and (&amp;) the importance of protectingPortugal against any external attack or internal coup d&apos;ktatengineered by enemy intrigues.It is also for consideration but this suggestion is made with full knowledgebf the difficulties and of the extent to which it lies outside the direct ForeignOffice sphere whether His Majesty&apos;s Government should not have disposed either in France or in the United Kingdom, a striking force which, would be ready toproceed to any destination at very short notice,t     This is a general point, which does not only apply to Portugal.I    May 10, 1940.
