this document is the property of his britannic majesty &apos;s governmentTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.S E G R.g 1W.P. (40)166*22ND MAYo 1940.COPY NO. 31WAR CABINET.FOOD SUPPLIES FOR FRENCH AND BELGIAN REFUGEES,First Progress Report by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.In accordance with the War Cabinet1s instructions(W.M,(40)132nd Conclusions, Minute 14), I have investigatedthe Possibility of sending supplies of food for the relief of Belgian and French refugees in ports in Northern France.The number of these refugees is estimated by the french ambassador at from 500*000 to 19000,000 persons and is constantly increasing.2,    The Minister of Food has already made available10,000 cases of canned meat at Le Havre and is in a positionto offer about 1,500 tins of canned fish (or meat), bisouits,flour and possibly some canned milk for despatch from theUnited Kingdom to other ports.3*    The main difficulty is that the three principal portsnorth of Le Havre (Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogne),together with the whole of the British shipping suitablefor use in these shallow and restricted harbours,  areliable to be required at the shortest notice for   military purposes of vital importance.     As a matter of principleI have decided that military considerations must come first and everything in this memorandum that follows issubordinated to this consideration.4.   All British shipping capable of use in the three portsreferred to has already been allocated for the use of theBritish Expeditionary Force and none can he madeavailable for refugees.       The Minister of Shipping, however,has succeeded in finding three Belgian ships of suitablesize which have been requisitioned by the British Governmentand are now being &quot;degaussed5&quot; or &quot;wiped&quot; preparatory toloading on Thursday morning.     Subject to the exigencies ofthe naval and military situation, and particularly to the availability of dooking facilities at Dunkirk, Calais,andBoulogne, it has been arranged that one ship shall go to each of those ports.     Each ship is to have on Board a Frenchofficer who will make contact with the French authoritiesand see to the nepessary distribution of the foodstuffs.He will also report on the food situation at each port with

a view to the possible despatch of further supplies if thisis   necessary or practicable.5.      I should add that at the request of the BelgianGovernment arrangements have already been made for thedespatch of 600 to 700 tons of foodstuffs to Ostend forrefugees held up in Y/estern Belgium owing to the closing of the Frensh frontier.     These supplies are being loadedto-d.ay and should arrive to-morrov/ morning.6.      I am continuing to keep in the closest touch with thesituation.(Signed)    HANKEY.Whitehall, S.?.l.,22-nd May, 1940.
