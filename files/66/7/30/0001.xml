Z%most SECRET.General Headq.uarters ,British Expeditionary Force.11th April,  1940.Sir,I propose shortly to submit to you my firstdespatch as Commander-in-Chief of the British ExpeditionaryForce, covering the period from the outbreak of war until january last.      That despatch will deal solely with pastevents relating to the Force under my command as it is notcustomary, nor indeed would it be proper, for it to recordmy views on the military situation as it exists to-day, orto consider future possibilities affecting my responsibilities,I feel, however, that at this season of the year, and atthis stage of the war,  it may be acceptable to you to receive an outline of the situation as it appears to me in relationto the British Expeditionary Force,2. The absence of active operations on land hasafforded the Army an invaluable opportunity to organise the defences, to carry out much needed training, and to accumulate some reserves of material.      But it would be unwise to count on a continuance of this lull.      We must be readyat any time, and at short notice, to engage a formidableand ruthless enemy who likewise has been making hispreparations and refitting his Armies after their victoriouscampaign in Poland.      The clash, when it comes, will beviolent;    it may even pr-ive decisive.3. Subject to the views of the French High Command,there seems little doubt that our operations in the firstplace will be mainly defensive.      Apart from the political considerations,  the existing superiority in men and material in the German Army and Air Force over those of the Allies mustpreclude an early assumption of the strategical offensiveby the Allies.As the German Army has the initiative, it is free to attack where and when it pleases and with little or nowarning.      The method of the attack must remain for thepresent a matter of speculation, but it is reasonable toassume that the power of the air and armoured formationswill be utilized to the maximum, as they were in Poland.It is conceivably possible that the German High Command has some surprise in store in the form cf a new weapon, or gas,but.so far there has besn no indication of it;    or they may hope to smother the defence by sheer weight of material and numbers, pressed home with all the violence of whichwe know the German Army to be capable.No matter what form the attack may take, theAllies must seek to utilize to the full the immensestopping power which modern armament confers on the defence.But, even so, it is man who fights the weapons and it is the

endurance of the human frame which is  the decisive factor.Gallantry alone is not enough and the most determineddefence must inevitably crumble at long last, as it did in finland, if it is subjected to succe;sive mass attacks by a continuous flow of fresh troops.      Unless thedefenders can be regularly pulled out of the fightingline to rest and refit, their physical exhaustion winsthe day for the attacker.4. The British Expeditionary Force may be calledupon at short notice to play once more the part which its forerunner played in the autumn of 1914.      It is,therefore, necessary for me to summarise the capabilitiesof the forces under my command to fulfil such a role.(a) The morale of the troops is excellent and onthat score I have no anxiety.,      They have borne up well against the German propaganda campaign and the conditions of a longand severe winter.      The fears expressed insome quarters on this subject have provedgroundless,(b) The military efficiency of the five Regular, divisions has improved in the last six months despite the handicaps imposed by being garrisonedin a highly industrialised and highlycultivated area.      Even so,  I am doubtfulwhether the standard is as high as in 1914owing,  in great part,  to the greater complexity of modern warfare.      On the other hand   thehigher commanders and senior staff officers have had previous experience of European war.The standard of training of the territorial divisions which have arrived in France is low and;, in my opinion, against a first-classenemy they are,  as yet, fit only for staticwarfare.In recording the above opinion on the regular and Territorial troops under my command, Iparticularly wish to make it clear that Icast no reflection on those responsible fortheir training, equipment and. despatch overseas.In August,  1914,the   Regular  Army went overseasfully equipped and trained for a war in Europe,in accordance with a clear cut policy whichhad been in force for some years.The situation in September, 1939, was totallydefferent.      The rearmament of the  RegularArmy was far from complete and, as a result,little training with the new equipment hadbeen possible;    while the Territorial Army,still in the throes of reorganisation consequent upon the decision to double its strength,possessed little more than token equipment.

5&quot; The shortages of war material, indeed., are causingme the chief concern,  and I have drawn attention, on a numberof occasions,  to deficiencies which exist not only in war reserves hut also in first line equipment.      It is thereforeunnecessary for me to enter into details, but I would specifyin particular tho serious shortage of tanks,  of ammunition for certain natures of equipment, of many types of vehiclereserves and spare parts, and of gas resources for retaliationif the Germans should use it.To conduct a protracted defensive battle it isessential to have immediately available the approved scales ofammunition and reserves;    without them many lives must beneedlessly sacrificed and the successful outcome of the battlewill depend, as has so often happened in the past, on the refusal of the British soldier to admit defeat,60 The Iilcelj.hood of a German attacr. on the western front has no doubt been assessed by others better placed thanmyself to judge the situation as a whole.      During the war1914-1918 Germany indulged in many subsidiary ventures as sheis doing in Scandinavia to-day, but, even so, both Falkenhaynand Ludendorff,  in their turn, reached the firm conclusionthat the final deciBion must be reached on the Western Front.&quot;No decision in the east, even though it was   ,as thorough as possible,  could spare us fromfighting to a conclusion in the west.      I set asideall thought of attacking in Macedonia or Italy.&quot;Ludendorff.From the German point of view the fact that russia is now a friend to be encouraged and not an enemy to overthrown,that Turkey is no longer an ally but a potential enemy to German expansion in the south east and that Norwegianbases on the North Sea are being seized,  all seemincreasingly to indicate that Germany will seek the finalmilitary victory in the Vest.      It seems at least probablethat,  sooner or later, Germany&apos;s sea and air offensive willbe supported by attack on land.      For what ether reason indeedis so great a German Army concentrated west of the Rhine?7n It is not for me to assess what total of land forces is required to sustain operations on the whole Western Frontagainst a German offensive, but I believe it is essentailthat such an assessment should be made from time to time,The available German formations are constantly increasingat a rate faster than those of the Allies, and we must at alltines be certain that we have the essential minimum alwaysavailable on the Western Front, where alone the war can bedecisively lost in a few weeks.As land forces cannot operate successfully in modernwar without air support, the availability of air forces must also be included in&quot; these assessments.      whilst the allied high Command can count on the willing and effective co-operation of all the air units now in France, this willnot be enough and the whole weight of our Metropolitan AirForces will&quot;&quot;be needed to help in the formidable task ofrepelling the German onslaught tfien it begins.    Germany to-dayhas the initiative and the power to surprise;    she canconcentrate her superior air forces wherever she decides.At present the Allies have superiority in aircraft and crews,but considerable inferiority in numbers.

Nevertheless I regard it as of first importance that we should have all our plans ready to concentrate the vrtLQia ..weignt of our bomber air forces, whether basedon France or-on England, on the immediate object of stopping the German onslaught.      Further, whilst fighter aircraft must he left to protect our Home Front,the greatest possible number must be made availableto take part in the struggle for air superiority in .those areas where the enemy&apos;s main air forces are operating,  should that be elsewhere.I have the honour to be.Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)    GCRT.Commander-in-Ghief,British Expeditionary Force.The Secretary of State for T7ar,The Var Office,Whitehall,  S.T7M.
