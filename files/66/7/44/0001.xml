As pointedout in that telegram, the Greeks did offer us such an alliance in the summer of1938. We turned down the offer, since the view held by the Chiefs of Staff atthe time was that if Bulgaria was hostile, and this seemed likely, we should haveto assume some responsibility for the defence of the long and difficult graeco-Bulgarian frontier. At that time the only case in which we should have wishedGreece to be a belligerent was when both Bulgaria and Turkey were on our side.Since that date Turkey has become allied to us under the Treaty of mutual assistance of last autumn, we have given a guarantee to Greece (April 1939), andthe attitude of Bulgaria still remains doubtful. On the other hand, the fear ofprovoking Italy, which was also present in our minds in 1938, assumes a differentaspect to-day when we are momentarily preparing for the Italians to interveneagainst us.In these circumstances a proposal for an alliance with Greece must perhaps be regarded simply in the light of the realities of the Mediterranean situation asit exists to-day.  These are : (a) That we are likely at any moment to be at war with Italy, and shall require all the assistance we can find in the Mediterranean. At present we can only count on Turkey.(b) That if we do not get Greece to commit herself she may run out andeven come to terms with Italy to save herself from invasion.(c) That the use of Greek territory may be important to us from a militaryand strategic standpoint, and at present we are not certain thatGreece would permit us to occupy her territory.(d) That if Bulgaria looks like playing the German game it may be quiteuseful to be able to threaten her with an invasion from Greece.(e) That without an alliance we cannot have full staff conversations with the greeks.(/) That the terms of the alliance could of course be so drawn as to leave it to us to decide if and when Greece should enter the war (c/..Portugal).Against this are the following considerations :  (g) It must be realised that if Greece were to become our ally we should perhaps assume rather greater moral obligations towards her than we are at present shouldering in virtue of our guarantee or that atleast might be her view.11037   [21303]
(Ji) The Greek Government would probably consider themselves justified in asking once again for armaments which we cannot supply.(i) The Greek Government would doubtless try to get us to extend the scopeof our existing guarantee to Greece, in return for their giving aguarantee to us, e.g., they might ask that our guarantee should be madeto apply in the case when Greece felt it essential to go to the assistanceof a neighbour if attacked, such as Yugoslavia.(j) It is still true that Signor Mussolini might resent such an alliance andthat it might conceivably be a factor in influencing him in his decision as to whether to intervene or not.In the circumstances, perhaps the main question for decision is whether ornot we should obtain under an alliance facilities which it-would be more difficultto obtain, or which might be denied us, without such a bond. It is difficult togive an answer to this question, which will probably depend on the course of operations on the Western front. If such an alliance could be kept completelysecret, perhaps the balance of advantage would be definitely in its favour. It is too much to suppose, however, that this could be done; but on balance I amnevertheless disposed to consider that we should instruct Sir M. Palairet to makeit plain to General Metaxas that if he were to offer an alliance we should beprepared to consider it.h.Foreign Office, May 20, 1940.ANNEX.Sir M. Palairet to Viscount Halifax. (Received May 18.)(No. 288.  DIPP.)(Telegraphic.) A thens, May 18, 1940.PRESIDENT of the Council is always reverting to his offer in 1938 tobecome our Ally, which we turned down on the grounds that we did not want to provoke Italy. Only this morning he said that the presence of Greek representa-tive at Beirut meeting would have been easy to explain if we were now Alliesas he had proposed.2. Would you consider it advisable, from strategical points of view, to ask him now whether he is prepared to accept both the advantages and risks of an alliance ?  I cannot of course guarantee that he will say yes.
