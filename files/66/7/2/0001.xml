A note on co-operation with the armed forces of Norway is attached at Appendix &apos;B*. *The War Office,April, 19U.0.aNot attached to this copy.

APPENDIX D. ;I0 ENCLOSURE I.NOTE PIT CO-OPER..vj?I01-T WITH THE ARI.ISDfqpceg UF NORWAY.(These notes are based on the aasamptionthat Norwegian co-operation is forth-coming eAten-tually).While the promotion of good relations with the armed forces of Norway is of great importance, thedesire to co-operate with these forces should not lead to the diversion of British troops from the roleallotted to them.As a general principle;, the forces of Norwayshould be, if possible, encouraged to undertake themore distant tasks, e.gBwatching roads and railways,coast watching, etc.      The sea approaches to alllocalities to be occupied are believed to be alreadycommanded lay fixed defences.The defence of naval and military establishments of Norway,  (e*gs, military aerodromes, naval sea-planestations), sho-uld normally be left to their owngarrisons, unless our assistance- is necessary andacceptable.Strength of army units.Efjace..    In peace-the Norwegian Army only exists for 84- days in the year.      During this period! its total strength is some 15,000, unit^&amp;*i^ngtha--being:-Infantry Regiment, approximately 500Cavalry Regiment, approximately 20uArtillery Regiment, approximately 275For the remainder of the year,  the army is re-duced to a small permanent cadre of some 2,000 men.War.        In war,  the army forms 6 i/fixed Brigades,consisting of&apos;;-4 infantry Battalions  (approximately 3,200800 men each).1 Artillery Regiment (2 Battery) 500Ancillary troops 800Total strength4.3Q0Cavalry units are apparently not included inthese Mixed Brigaded.The present strength (March 1940) of the Nor-wegian Army is believed to be about 20,000 of which halfare in the north.

The Orderof Battle of the force is &quot;being communicated to youseparatelyo2. Your force will constitute an independent commanddirectly under the War Office.3. The role of your force is to forestall the germans and deny to them the use of the port and air facilities at STAVANGER, BERGEN and TRONDHEIM,      Since they will haveto operate independently of Force Headq.uarters in thefirst instance operation instructions have been issueddirect to O.G. Troops STAVANGER and to 0,Cc TroopsTRONDHSIM.      Copies of these instructions are attached.It will be seen that the operations at STAVANGER are inthe nature of a raid .whereas it is intended that the forcesat BERGEN and TRONDHEIM should remain and if necessary bereinforcedo4. There are two sets of circumstances in which a landing may be undertaken:-(a) At the - invitation of Norway,      In this case theco-operation of the Norwegians can be assumed.(b) Following immediately on a hostile German act inNorwaye      In this case we may not have received an invitation from Norway and the attitude ofthe Norwegians at your ports of disembarkationwill be uncertain.      It is the intention ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government that your force shouldland provided it can do so without seriousfighting.The decision as to whether disembarkation is to be begun or completed at each destination will be taken bythe Senior Naval Officer present.     Local military commanders will assume liberty of action only whendisembarkation has been completed.5, If the Norwegians open fire on your troops a certainnumber of -casualties must be accepted.      Fire uponNorwegian troops is &quot;&quot;only to -be opened as a--last resort.Subject to this you are given discretion to use such force as may be required to ensure the safety of your command,but no more&amp;It will be at the discretion of the commander ofeach force., having regard to the attitude of the norwegians, to decide whether it is feasible to continuethe operation or to withdraw the force.6. In the e^ent of the force destined for BERGEN being unable to land,  it will endeavour to land at TRONDHEIM.If this is unsuccessful&apos; also the force will return to united Kingdom.

7. A landing is to be made at NARVIK by forcesindependent of you,, The probable date of this landing willbe communicated to you before yon sail.8.       - If and when it is found necessary to withdraw theforce from 8TAY/1TGER it will be placed at your disposal foruse either at BERGEN or TRONDHEIM.9. The initial distribution of your force will be asshown at Appendix A.      plans for transportation anddisembarkation have been based on this distribution, andwill be communicated to you separately.10.        It is possible that German forces may effect landingsat certain points in Norway either before or after the arrival of the force.      In particular, a German landing inthe area OSLO - sign I ST I AN 8 AND before the force has discussed-embarked is possible;    and it is also possible that theenemy may attempt to anticipate us at STAVANGER.It is considered unlikely t at he could occupyBERGEN or TRONDHEIM before the arrival of our detachments.A note on possible German operations in Norway isat Appendix Bollo        It is not at present possible to foresee how thesituation will develop, or what additions to the force may eventually be required^      Once you are established atBERGEN and TRONDHEIM it is the intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to despatch such reinforcements as may prove: necessary to maintain our footing in Norway in the faceI of German action,,You will therefore have reconnaissances made andreport as soon as possible on the force that would berequired (at BERGEN and TRONDHEIM) to enable the existingNaval and Air facilities to be used in security by ourown forceso12a        The following means of intercommunication will beavailable:-(a) Within the force.    - Signal Section &quot;Wireless, andthe Civil Telegraph System, may be&apos;available.(b) BeJiween .Pqrj3e JH       and mthe .

to ENCLOSURE II.NOTE OH POSSIBLE/GERMAN OPERATIONS IN NORWAY.1.      Geman..fprcej3 available for an attack on Norway.(a) Ayrnyo       There are possibly four divisions onthe Pomeranian Coast, which have been given some trainingin combined operations.-.     There are doubtless other enemyformations which have had similar experience, and these could be concentrated quickly on the coast, as could alsothe mountain divisions^(D) Shipso     There have been numerous reports that ships have been fitted out for combined operations, butthere are no details as to numbersn     There is, however,no shortage of shipping and it is reasonable to assume that if Germany contemplates operations she hasconcentrated sufficient craft ?:or the purpose.(c) Aire       Germany is believed to possess a totalof at least&quot;l,000 troop-carrying aircraft, which could be concentrated quickly.      She also has a minimum of 4,000parachutists and 6,000 air landing troops, and the air-craft are sufficient to transport all these..2.     An attack on Osloo(a) Sea-borne .^expeditions       Oslo Fiord is about 50miles long and in many places very narrow.     Any direct attack by sea would be most hazardous, as the narrow partof the main channel 15 miles south of Oslo is guarded bydefences of 30 guns up to 10-inchoIt would appear that &quot;the only way to reach thetown would be toJLand on either side of the Fiord south ofthe defences and advance northwards.     The country is forthe most part closely wooded, but roads are goods      It isnot known what suitable beaches there are, but the. Fiordis deep and boats should be able to go close in.Norwegian troops in the Oslo area consist of6 infantry regimentsP 1 cavalry regiment and 2 artilleryregiments, and these might be reinforced by 1 infantryregiment and 1 cavalry regimentoIt is estimated that the Germans would require acorps of 3 divisions and corps troops, to carry out this operation.(D) Air-borne expedltion.       There are two aerodromes,a small military one&quot; about 10 miles to the north-east ofthe town, and the other a large civil one, north of thetown, not yet complete..The area is for the most part thickly wooded, whichwould make parachute descents difficult, but it might bepossible to seize the aerodromes for the deplaning of airlanding troopso     It is doubtful, however, whether these would be sufficient to overcome local resistance.

3 * ML attack on Kristiansando(a) Sea-borne expedi tien.       Kristiansand   stands,some 5 miles&apos; inside the Kristiansand Fiord   and--the defencesare all^sited in the immediate neighbourhood of the town,though t&apos;hey probably cover the greater part of the fiord.There are believed to be suitable landing placeswith beaches outside the fiord, about 2-g- miles south-west of the town, and some 6 miles further to the West.     an advance on Kristiansand should present no great difficulties-The Norwegian troops in the area consist of 1infantry regiment and 1 artillery regiment, and couldonly be reinforced from 0slooIt is estimated that the Germans would require a division to complete this operationc,(b) Air-borne expedition.     There is believed to bean aerodrome&quot;about 5 miles north-east of the town, but no details are available as to its size.,      If it is suitable,and ov/ing to the smallnass of the Norwegian garrison,it is possible that an air-borne expedition might be successful, but subsequently some troops would have to bebrought by sea for the defence of the area.4* An attack on StavangeroNo information about the defences of Stavanger isavailableo     It is believed, however, that its capturewould not. be difficulto     The Norwegian garrison consists of 1 infantry regiment, and it could not be easilyreinforced except by sea,,     Owing to the situation ofthe town, it is probable that one German division wouldbe sufficient to capture and hold the area.There is an excellent aerodrome some 12 miles south-west of the towno     The nature of the country isnot known, but presumably it is wooded and thus not verysuitable for rjarachutists, but as in the case of Oslo itmight be possible to carjture the areodrome.      It isbelieved, however? that the aerodrome is mined.5.       Routes from-Osloa(a) Oslow-.J3er^en0     There is one single linerailway from Oslo to Bergen, which passes   throughmountainous country.     No figures are available, but itis not thought that more than three divisions could bemaintained on this line.      Sabotage should be effective.There are two road routes, one following the general line of the railway, and the other running more to thesouth.      loth are broken by an inlet requiring transfer byferry over a distance of 14 miles.The northern route is believed to be kept open with difficulty throughout the year, but is extremely narrowand little more than a cart track in places.The southern route-is&quot;impassable for some nine-months of the year0

(b) Qslom,-MJ3tavgangers There is no reasonable route from Oslo&quot;&apos;&quot;to&quot;s*tava&apos;nge&quot;r except via Kristiansand. There isa railway from Oslo to Kristiansand,(c) Oslo j  Trondheima       There is a through railway from Oslo&apos;te TrondheTm and an alternative route.There are two principal roads running fromTrondheim to 0sloo      One has been much improved latelyas it has been widened and resurfaced.      It has been described as long but adequate.     The other road isprobably indifferent,, and it is doubtful whether eitheris continuously open during the winter.6.     Route s from Kristiansand.(a) Kristiansand - Stavanger. The only Ine ofcommunication is by road from Kristiansand for 89-g- miles to Flekkefjord and thence by road or rail to Stavanger(93 miles).     The roads run fairly close to the coast, andthere should not therefore be great difficulty in transit at any time of the year.      It is a normalmotor-bus route cIt is probable, however, that a force inoccupation of Stavanger would have little difficulty inrepelling an attack from this direction.(b) Kristiansand - Bergen. There are two roadsfor a part&quot; &quot;of &quot;the wayV&apos;and then one road on to Bergen,but neither is practicable for military operations owingto the gradients and curves, and a break of 14- miles ata ferry.7.     Snow . condi tions *Generally speaking snow-falls are heavy in eastand northern Norway, but usually slight in the westerncoastal districtscTrondheim is likely to have snow well into Aprilbut Bergen and Stavanger should be clear of snow by theend of Marcho      The high ground near Bergen will besnow-covered well into April, but the area round Stavangeris largely flat and little snow is therefore likely.
