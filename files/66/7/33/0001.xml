(40) 332.)May 10, 1940.TO BE KEPT  UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SEABORNE AND AIRBORNE ATTACK ON THE UNITED KINGDOM.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee in Collaboration with theMinistry of Home Security.&quot;WE have reviewed our previous report* on seaborne and airborne attack onthe United Kingdom in the light of the situation created by the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. We submit below the Conclusions we have reached and we attach as an annexf the detailed appreciation from which these are drawn.CONCLUSIONS.(a) The possibility of small-scale raids still remains, and the danger has been extended northwards to the Shetlands.   (Paragraph 5.)(b) The possibility of invasfon is conditional upon the Germans having gaineda high degree of air superiority. For this reason the first stage islikely to be an attack upon our air forces and&apos; their maintenanceorganisation.   (Paragraph 6.)(c) Without the preliminary occupation of Holland we do not thinkGermany can achieve a sufficient measure of air superiority to makeinvasion possible. Whether the enemy can achieve the necessarymeasure of air superiority can only be proved by the ultimate test inthe conditions of widespread and heavy air attack. If, however, theGermans occupy Holland, we think that it would be unwise to assume that they might not achieve a sufficient measure of success to warrantan attempt at invasion.   (Paragraph 8.)(d) Seaborne invasion is likely to be preceded by a heavy scale of air attackon our naval forces and accompanied by air bombardment and landing of airborne troops.   (Paragraphs 9 and 10.)(e) If the Germans decide to attempt a landing, they are likely to choosethose places at which the full weight of their short-range bombers and fighters could be brought to bear. We therefore consider that the places where attempts to land are most likely to be made are on thecoast between the Wash and Folkestone. It is possible that the enemymight make a landing in Scotland, possibly in the Shetlands, beforethe main attack, as a diversion. The necessary counter-measures should be put in hand.   (Paragraphs 11 to 17.)* Paper No. C.O.S. (3.9) 125. f Annex I.[21243] t,
(f) Enemy &quot; Fifth Column &quot; activities will be designed to play a dangerous and important part in any operation which Germany may undertakeagainst this country.The degree to which aliens can be controlled by the authoritiesand the adequacy of the legal powers which exist to deal with suchaliens should be examined and any steps considered necessary toimprove the situation should be taken immediately.   (Paragraph 18.)We would also draw attention to our recommendations in PapersNos. W.P. (40) 145 and W.P. (40) 143, which are closely connected with theproblems considered in this review.2. In the light of the above conclusions we have had a preliminary discussion with General Sir Walter Kirke, Commander-in-Ghief, Home Forces.The chief points which emerged from this discussion were: (a) The need for strengthening the staff of  the  Commander-in-Chief,Home Forces.This matter is being taken up by the War Office. In addition it will, be seen that in the proposals contained in our Directive (Annex II) arrange-ments will be made to ensure that the necessary co-ordination is established between the Staff of the Commander-in-Chief,&apos; Home Forces, and the staffs of the other Commanders-in-Chief concerned, including the Operations Staffof the Ministry of Home Security.(b) Warning and dissemination of orders.Taking into account that considerable confusion might arise at the timeof invasion as a result of air bombing and &quot; Fifth Column &quot; activities, greatimportance attaches to an efficient system of warning and to duplicatedmethods of communication. The Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, has accordingly been invited to pay particular attention to this aspect of theHome Defence Organisation in close consultation with the Civil Authoritiesand the General Post Office.(c) Transport.We were informed that sufficient first-line transport was held by all unitsconcerned in Home Defence for the conveyance of one Company per Battalion.Transport for the remainder has been earmarked, and could be assembledfairly quickly. We found, however, that three points required particular attention:  (i) Some Divisions are without R.A.S.C. staff to deal with the mass of transport which would be assembled,(ii) Legal powers are required to compel civilian drivers of vehicles tocarry out their orders,(iii) Practice movements under the Defence Schemes could not becarried out without the hiring of transport, which would be expensive.(d) Arrangements for replacement of Divisions.Satisfactory arrangements are in hand which will permit of the replace-ment of the Divisions ordered abroad, thus obviating any need to form specialHome Defence Divisions.(e) The preparation of demolitions in suitable areas.The experience in Norway has shown the disastrous effects of failure toblow up threatened lines of communication. Consideration is therefore being given by the War Office to the preparation of plans for the carrying out ofdemolitions in suitable areas.
(f) Defence of Coast Defence Batteries against air attack, and on the land-ward side.Attention is being paid to the importance of ensuring the safety of coast defence Batteries against landward attack, and against machine gunningfrom the air, since the enemy would be likely to do everything in his powerto neutralise these batteries at any port he might select for his attack.(g) Shetland Islands.Steps are being taken to strengthen the garrison of the Shetland Islandsif, as a result of personal inspection by the Commander-in-Chief, home forces, this is found to be necessary and practicable.(h) Exercises to test defences.It was agreed, that to test the defence arrangements of the three Services,large-scale exercises, in which the Civil Defence Organisation should beinvited to co-operate, should be held as soon as possible, and that financial considerations should not be allowed to stand in the way of carrying out these exercises.3. With a view to ensuring that plans are co-ordinated by the Commanders-in-Chief and the Regional Commissioners concerned, we have prepared a draftdirective which we attach as Annex II to this report. If will be noted that inparagraph 8 of this directive we recommend the setting up of a &quot; Home defence executive,&quot; which we suggest should be responsible to us. In anticipation ofthe approval of the War Cabinet to this directive we have arranged for actionto be taken by all concerned.C. L. N.

ANNEX ISEABORNE AND AIRBORNE ATTACK ON THE UNITED kingdom in 1940.Detailed Appreciation and Summary of Conclusions.General Considerations.IN November 1939 we reviewed the problem of seaborne and airborne attackon the United Kingdom and submitted a report* to the War Cabinet. broadly speaking, in the circumstances then obtaining, we reached the conclusion thatsmall-scale raids, although a possibility, did not constitute a serious threat, andthat, so long as our&apos; naval and air forces remained in being, and provided thenecessary precautions were maintained effectively, the invasion of this country by means of a combined airborne and seaborne expedition did not constitute aserious threat to our security. On this appreciation our present plans for thedefence of this country are based..2. We have re-examined this question in the light of the situation created by the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. As a result of our experience in these operations, the following factors of importance have been brought intorelief : (i) Naval forces, unless effectively covered by defending fighters, can onlyinterfere sporadically and to a limited extent with sea communica-tions which are within range of a formidable force of shore-basedbombers.(ii) Harbours within range of a heavy scale of air attack cannot be used as naval bases, even by light craft, unless adequately defended. Thedefence must include fighters in sufficient strength.(iii) The German air transport units in Norway have shown themselves tobe well organised and effective, and have carried large numbers oftroops and a quantity of supplies. It must be remembered, however,that though they have no doubt suffered some dislocation by ourbombing of their aerodromes they have been able to operate with no opposition in the air. Their transport aircraft are most unlikely to be used over this country by day unless a high degree of air&apos;i superiority had been attained, though they might well be used to drop parachute troops at night. Parachute troops have only been used on a very limited scale in Norway, mainly for sabotage purposes.(iv) The Germans have shown themselves prepared to accept considerably greater risks in transporting troops by sea than we have hithertoconsidered probable. The severe losses they are believed to have sustained in waters where it is difficult for our naval or air forces to get at them may well act as a deterrent to more ambitious projectsinvolving longer and/or more vulnerable lines of communication,(v) The Germans have exploited the use of the &quot;Fifth Column&quot; to considerable advantage,(vi) German Naval forces have been considerably reduced in strength,(vii) The capture of Southern Norway has given Germany bases closer tothe northern part of the United Kingdom.    This has markedlyincreased the vulnerability of our naval bases and shipping in theNorth. Moreover it has put the enemy in a position to make subsidiaryattacks in the North such as a coup de main against the Shetlands orthe landing of raiding parties in Scotland,(viii) Our operations at Narvik have created a serious commitment for our naval and air forces and A.A. defences.   At the same time theoccupation of Denmark, and of Central Norway, has increased theair threat to the North and East Coast of the British Isles, thus forcingupon us an undesirable dispersion of our fighter defences.* Paper No. CCS. (39) 125.     &apos;
(ix) The Germans are past masters at the secret preparation and rapidexecution of a plan. They have shown an unexpected aptitude forcarrying out large-scale overseas operations, employing land, sea andair forces, with boldness, resourcefulness and without regard forlosses.3. As we have recently* pointed out the German invasion of Denmark and norway may well be the first step in a major strategic plan aimed at seeking adecision this year. If this is true the main enemy attack is likely to fall upon this country, the most serious threat to our security being an intensive air offensive, which, if successful, might culminate in an attempt at actual invasion.The occupation by the enemy of the Low Countries would seriously increase this threat.It is in the light of the above factors and the probable preliminary occupationof the Low Countries by the Germans, that we now review the problem of airborneand seaborne attack on the United Kingdom.Types of A attack.4.   Combined operations against this country can be divided into: (i) Raids, and(ii) Invasion.Raids.5. Raids may be either seaborne or airborne. In the light of the factors in paragraph 2 above, however, we consider that the danger has been extendednorthwards to the Shetlands. Such raids are more likely to be carried out asdiversions, simultaneously with an intensive air attack or invasion, rather than as isolated operations in themselves. They might be aimed at the destruction ofisolated points of particular military importance, such as R.D.F. stations or vitalcentres of communication, and would probably be combined with action by the&quot;Fifth Column&quot; unless we had previously taken adequate steps against that organisation. c i..v &apos;. , -----   : -Raiding parties would probably be armed with light automatics and handgrenades and, while they could not last out indefinitely, would be formidable evenif limited in strength.Invasion.6. Under existing conditions, when fighter protection can be provided atany point on our coast likely to be threatened, there is no reason to revise our previous conclusiont that &quot;so long as our naval and air forces remain in being and provided the necessary precautions are maintained effectively&quot; invasion isnot a serious danger.We must therefore consider the steps that the enemy is likely to take to attain a degree of air superiority that he may think sufficient for his purpose.This is the crux of the problem, since, if the Germans succeeded in neutralisingour air forces, it might be impossible for our naval forces to prevent the establish-ment and maintenance of considerable German forces in this country.On the other hand, in such a situation all our available naval forces wouldhave to be thrown into the struggle, regardless of loss. And it may well be thatthe German Air Force, in the course of the preliminary air offensive, might soexhaust itself as to be unable to provide adequate cover for the establishment andmaintenance of the expedition against such naval forces as remain.7. It is clearly impossible to estimate with any accuracy the chances ofsuccess of any German attempt to neutralise our naval and air forces. We canbut set out the facts as they appear to us :-(a) The German Bomber force has a large preponderance, in numbers of aircraft, over the Allies. Towards the end of this year, however, theAllied Bomber strength should show substantial increase.* Paper No. C.O.S.: (40) 310 (J.P.) (S).f Paper No. C.O.S. (39).125, paragraph 33 (ii).
(b) As regards our own Fighters, the scale of air attack which Germany could bring against this country has increased, and we have a wide front todefend. Although our fighters have shown marked superiority overGerman bombers and our aerodromes-are suitably dispersed, we are stilldeficient in fighter aircraft, but the position should improve withinthe next few months.(c) The enemy cannot ignore the French Air Force, and are unlikely therefore to concentrate the whole of their Air Force on this country. Italianintervention against&apos; us might, however, further release enemy ait-forces for action against this country.(d) At present we rely upon two factories for the production of fighter aircraft engines.(e) We are still seriously deficient in Anti-Aircraft equipments, both forA.D.G.B. and the B.E.F. The most serious shortage is in light A.A.guns. Moreover, there are heavy demands for despatch of equipmentsto other theatres.8. Nothing short of the ultimate test in the conditions of widespread and heavy air attack will provide the answer to this problem. It may be that the effectof our retaliation on Germany, coupled with a successful defeat of the initial aironslaught, will call a halt to any attempt to seek a decision by these methods, inwhich case the question of invasion will not arise. Nevertheless, we consider itwould be unwise to assume that the Germans might not achieve a sufficientmeasure of success to encourage them to risk a gamble on invasion.A necessary preliminary to this success would be the occupation of Holland,which would enable Germany to employ short-range fighters for air escort,her dive-bombers and her air transport fleet of about 800 aircraft. Furthermore,she would then have the added advantage of the short sea routes between holland and the British Isles.Without the preliminary occupation of Holland, we do not think thatGermany can achieve a sufficient measure of air superiority to make invasionpossible.Possible plan of invasion.9. The German plan for invasion of the United Kingdom might be expectedto develop on the following lines : Preliminary air and naval&apos;offensive.10. The initial air offensive, combined with sabotage, would most probablyaim at achieving the maximum possible degree of neutralisation of our fighter and bomber forces. We must expect a systematic attack on our B,.A.F. stations,our first line air strength, reserves, maintenance organisation and aircraft industry. This offensive would be combined with or followed by air operations against our naval ports and ships on the south and east coasts, and intensivemining aimed at denying the area selected for attack to our naval forces.It is improbable that the enemy would proceed to the subsequent stages of a plan of invasion until he had gone a long way towards the achievement of theseaims.A rea in which invasion is most likely to occur.11. Since the Germans cannot expect to attain complete neutralisation ofour naval and air forces, it seems improbable that they would attempt airborneor seaborne landings in strength outside the area in which the full weight of theirshort-range bombers and fighters could be brought to bear. Moreover, it is withinthe area covered by these types of aircraft that German forces could be transported by the shortest sea routes and could land within striking distance ofthe most vital area in the country London. We therefore consider the most vulnerable area to be between the Wash on the east coast and Folkestone on thesouth coast. .On this coast line the Thames Estuary is difficult to approach and sufficientlystrongly defended to act as a considerable deterrent to a surprise landing. Owingto the necessity of passing through the Straits of Dover and the longer passage from German or Dutch ports, attacks appear much less likely on the south than on
the east coast. Initial landings at Yarmouth, Harwich and Dover are unlikelyas these ports are defended, but there are numerous beaches on the East andSouth-East coasts which are suitable for landings.Direct air support to the expedition.12. Both airborne and seaborne expeditions would almost certainly be supported by air action to cover their approach, assist the landings, isolate theareas where footings had been obtained and to attempt to block the movements of defending forces.Airborne expedition.13. The initial landings might be made by parachute troops, of which theGermans have 5,000. They would be employed to gain control of landing grounds,especially those adjacent to ports. These landing grounds would be used for the landing of substantial numbers of troops, and the Germans have sufficient aircraft to transport some 11,000. We consider that it is probable that they would try tomake initial landings in this way and would be prepared to incur considerablelosses.Seaborne expedition.14. From the German point of view the provision of the necessary troops for an invasion would present no problem. Ample shipping is at the enemy&apos;disposal. The first German requirement will be the capture of landing placesthrough which vehicles can be put ashore. This might be achieved by landing onbeaches in the vicinity (which may be synchronised with landings by air) supportedby air bombardment and fighter aircraft, and helped by &apos;&apos; Fifth Column&quot;activities. Subsequently, through the first captured landing places, the enemy would try to establish and maintain enough forces to extend their control oversufficient ports and harbours to ensure adequate communications for their maininvading forces.The selection of initial landing places and subsequent entry ports will be dependant partly on the mined areas through which approaching forces wouldhave to pass. Reconnaissance of the movements of Allied shipping may revealthe limits of our swept channels and so enable German forces to pass our mine-field.   Sweeping may also be employed during the approach.Warning we might receive of German intentions.15. The inception of an air offensive as described above would be a warning of possible enemy intentions. The despatch of a large-scale expedition against this country while naval and air forces are in being is not, in our opinion, a practicable operation of war and would not be attempted. The only positiveinformation we might expect to obtain of the intention to undertake seaborneinvasion would be the concentration of the ships and troops. The actual date ofsailing and the point or points of attack would remain in doubt until the last moment.An enemy landing in the Shetlands.16. We have already drawn attention in paragraph 5 above to the possibilityof diversions, in the form of raids, in the North of England and Scotland. Thereis one possibility to which we would draw particular attention. With Norwegianharbours and aerodromes in German hands, a landing in the Shetlands differs inmany respects from a raid on the mainland of Great Britain. The presentgarrison consists of one Home Defence Battalion comprising a HeadquartersCompany and four Rifle Companies and one Company of Territorials. Withthis insufficient garrison, a raid might succeed in gaining control of the mainislands; since, as only a small force would be needed to effect this, it might landwith sufficient supplies to last it for some time, and might thereafter be suppliedintermittently by sea and air transport, relying on evasion. Moreover, the shetlands are only 230 miles from Stavanger aerodrome.17. The effects on our prestige of enemy troops in occupation of Britishsoil would be serious and far-reaching. In addition, the enemy might succeed in destroying the air facilities, which would be a serious inconvenience. We thinkit not impossible that this landing might be attempted before the main attack
as a diversion to distract our attention to the North. We therefore consider thatan adequate garrison should be maintained in the Shetlands and, in particular,at Lerwick and SumburghFifth Column.18. Bearing in mind the important part that the German &quot; Fifth Column &quot;has played in their war plans, and the extent to which freedom of afction is givento the great numbers of- enemy aliens in this country, there is no doubt thatFifth Column &apos;&apos; activities will play a very dangerous and important part inany operation the enemy may undertake against this country, unless adequatesteps are taken to deal with them. A report by the Joint Intelligence Sub-Committee on this subject is attached.** Appendix to Annex II.
ANNEX II,seaborne and airborne attack on the united&apos;&apos;    &apos;  :&apos; kingdom. ,;,      ,ftpHMl Directive by the Chiefs oe Staff.Object.1. THE object of this directive is to ensure that plans to meet seaborne andairborne attack on the United Kingdom are co-ordinated by the Commander^-in-Chief and the Regional Commissioners concerned.Nature of Possible Enemy Action Basis for Planning.2. In spite of the reduction in German naval strength, the situation created by the German invasion of Denmark, Norway and Holland has increased thepossibility of enemy seaborne and airborne attacks on the British Isles. planning to meet this eventuality should take into account the following types of enemy action: Invasion.3. The German plan for invasion might be expected to develop on thefollowing lines : Preliminary air and naval offensive.(a) The initial air offensive, combined with sabotage, would most probablyaim at achieving the maximum possible degree of neutralisation of our fighter and bomber forces. It is improbable that the enemy would proceed to the subsequent stages of a plan of invasion until he had gone a long way towards the achievement of these aims. We must expect a systematic attack on our R.D.F. stations, first line air units,reserves, maintenance organisation and aircraft industry. Thisoffensive would be combined with or followed by air operations against our naval ports and ships on the south and east coasts and intensivemining aimed at denying the area selected for attack to our naval forces. The occupation of Holland appears an essential preliminary to invasion.Area in which invasion is most likely to occur.(b) Since the Germans cannot expect to attain complete neutralisation of our naval and air forces, it seems improbable that they would attemptairborne or seaborne landings in strength outside the area in which thefull weight of their short-range bombers and fighters could be broughtto bear. Moreover, it is within the area covered by these types of aircraft that German forces could be transported by the shortest searoutes and could land within striking distance of the most vital area in the country London.The Thames Estuary is difficult to approach and sufficientlystrongly defended to act as a considerable deterrent to a surpriselanding. Owing to the necessity of passing through the Straits ofDover and the longer passage from German or Dutch ports, attackappears much less likely on the south than on the east coast. Thearea in which attack is most likely lies between the Wash andNewhaven, but the possibility of landing on the East Coast further to the North must also be taken into account.
Direct Air Support to the Expedition.(c) Both  airborne  and  seaborne expeditions would  most  certainly  be supported by air action to cover their approach, assist the landings,isolate the areas where footings had been obtained, and to attempt to block the movements of defending forces.Airborne Expedition.(d) The initial landings might be made by parachute troops of which theGermans have 5,000. They would be employed to gain, control of landing grounds, especially those adjacent, to ports. These landing grounds would be used for the landing of substantial numbers oftroops, and the Germans have sufficient aircraft to transport some11,000. It is probable that they would try to nUi&amp;^nitial landings inthis way and would be prepared to incur considerable losses. the probability that the enemy will wear British uniforms should be borne in mind, and all troops landed in this way should be treated as enemy.Seaborne Expedition.(e) The first German requirement will be the capture of landing placesthrough which vehicles can be put ashore. This might be achieved by landing on beaches in the vicinity (which may be synchronised withlandings by air) supported by air bombardment and fighter aircraft and helped by &quot;Fifth Column&quot; activities. Subsequently, throughthe first captured landing places, the enemy would try to establish and maintain enough forces to extend their control over sufficientports and harbours to ensure adequate communications for their maininvading forces.The selection of initial landing places and subsequent entry portswill be dependent partly on the mined areas through whichapproaching forces would have to pass. Reconnaissance of the move-ments of Allied shipping may reveal the limits of our swept channelsand so enable German forces to pass our minefield. Sweeping may also be employed during the approach.Warning we might receive of attempt at invasion.4. The inception of an air offensive as described above would be a warning of possible enemy intentions. The only positive information to be expected wouldbe the concentration of the ships and troops. The actual date of sailing and thepoint or points of attack would remain in doubt until revealed by reconnaissance.Raids.5. Raids may be either seaborne or airborne. Owing to the new bases theenemy has acquired, the area in which they may occur has now extended north-wards to the Shetlands. Raids may aim at the destruction of isolated points ofparticular importance such as R.D.F. stations or vital centres of communication and would probably be combined with &apos;&apos; Fifth Column &apos;&apos; action. Raids may alsobe undertaken as diversions, simultaneously with intensive air attacks or invasion,rather than as isolated operations in themselves.An Enemy landing in the Shetlands.6. A landing in the Shetlands might assume a more serious complexion asthe Germans might succeed in gaining control of the main islands with acomparatively small force, which they might be able to maintain. The effect onour prestige of an actual occupation of British soil would be very serious.Arrangements must therefore be made to eliminate the possibility of the enemylanding in this area.&quot; Fifth Column.&quot;7. Bearing in mind the important part that the German &quot; Fifth Column &quot;has played in their war plans, and the extent to which freedom of action is givento the great numbers of enemy aliens in this country, there is no doubt that &quot; fifth column &apos;&apos; activities will play a very dangerous and important part in anyoperation the enemy may undertake against this country, unless adequate steps are taken to deal with them. A report by the Joint Intelligence Committee onthis subject is attached.** Appendix.
221Defence Measures.8. To ensure that plans and action to deal with airborne and seaborneattacks are fully co-ordinated, a &apos;&apos; Home Defence Executive &apos;&apos; will at once be setup under the chairmanship of the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces. TheExecutive, while remaining individually responsible to their own Ministries, willbe jointly responsible to the Chiefs of Staff Committee.The members will be the Air^Qfficers Commanding-in-Chief, Bomber, Fighter,and Coastal Commands^the&quot;TJeputy Chief of the Operations Staff,&quot;&quot;Ministry of&quot;Home Security, and a representative of the Admiralty. Depending upon theirjoint plans, they will take such action as lies within their own powers. If they require further authority, powers, or assistance they will apply to their ownMinistries.The Executive will have power to appoint joint planning staffs and sub-committees as necessary.9. The following aspects of the problem are brought to the particular noticeof the Executive : (i) The necessity for obtaining and issuing to all the authorities concernedearly and reliable information as to the likelihood of impending enemyoperations.(ii) The provision of special air and naval reconnaissance to give the earliestpossible warning of the assembly and passage of a seaborne expedition,when such a threat becomes imminent.(iii) The particular areas in which seaborne and airborne attacks are most likely and most dangerous.(iv) The minelaying policy to be adopted to defend approaches to likelypoints of attack.(v) The development of the organisation to give immediate warning tothe military and civil authorities of any enemy landing either on ourcoast or inland. The adequacy of the present system requires furtherconsideration. For example, the possibility should be examined ofconnecting up observer corps centres direct to the nearest militaryformations so that very early information of parachute landings mightbe given.(vi) The adequate protection of our aerodromes against sabotage by the&quot; Fifth Column &quot; or seizure by parachute troops, and arrangementsfor the rapid move of troops to reinforce aerodrome garrisons. Thepresent arrangements cannot be considered adequate, particularly forthe latter.(vii) The disposition of the requisite naval forces at ports whence earlyinterception of an enemy expedition can be ensured.(viii) Facilities for concentrating our fighter and A.A. defences within range of the enemy&apos;s most probable areas of disembarkation.(ix) The disposition of the necessary troops within easy reach of threatenedareas and plans for their rapid concentration under conditions ofair bombardment.(x) Provision of adequate defences at ports and landing places.(xi) The organisation and security of communications including alternative methods of communication in the event of sabotage, and use of B.B.C.(xii) The preparation of a comprehensive demolition plan and other measuresto delay an enemy advance. The responsibility for the demolition of equipment and resources useful to the enemy should be clearly defined.(xiii) Consideration of the implication of the problem as affecting&quot; existingplans for evacuation of both casualties and the civil population.,(xiv) Active steps to implement the legal powers now obtained for the conductof activities of the &quot; Fifth Column.&quot;(xv) Practical methods of educating the civil population to co-operate with civil and military defence plans both before and during operations.

(40) 315 (J.I.C.).]May 2, 1940.WAR CABINET.Chiefs of Staff Committee.&quot; FIFTH COLUMN &quot; ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.Report by the Joint Intelligence Committee.WE have summarised in the attached paper* the information available on german subversive activities in foreign countries and have given examples oftheir successful application. From this evidence, we feel that the followingbroad deductions may legitimately be drawn : (1) All preparations for subversive action in foreign countries were under-taken in complete secrecy. No hint was given by way of partialdisclosure or premature sabotage by which the Government threatenedcould profit.(2) The preparations for establishing control in those foreign countries which. have been invaded by Germany appear to have been aimed, at thefollowing main points, which are of equal importance : (a) centres of communication,  telephone exchanges, wireless and power stations;(b) transportation centres, air, sea and land;(c) centres of importance to the fighting services;(d) any other objectives which are vital to the life of the country,e.g., essential factories.(3) The final aim is (a) actual sabotage on a well-ordered military plan;(b) demoralisation of public opinion with a view to breaking the will of the people to resist.(4) The ground for these schemes is in the first place prepared by the useof methods of infiltration varying from contact with political parties and groups to direct pressure brought to bear upon individuals,whether of German origin or nationals of the country in which theyreside.We have considered how far these lessons can be applied to possible &apos;&apos; fifth column &quot; activities in this country, in the event of military operations here.We have taken into account the fact that the European countries alreadyinvaded or threatened by Germany have for some. considerable time been opento subversive activities on a scale which it is hoped cannot exist in this country.Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that &apos;&apos; Fifth Column 1&apos;activities in this country, at present dormant, might well play a very active and highly dangerous part at the appropriate moment selected by the enemy.Indeed, the absence of sabotage up to date reinforces the view that such activitieswill only take place as part of a prearranged military plan,   ,* Enclosure.     &quot; &apos;      &apos;-
* The crews of Danish ships which are used by us are a potential danger, in view of thefact that whatever their own feelings may be, their relations are in the hands of the Gestapo.The main features of &quot;Fifth Column&quot; activity with which we are con-fronted in this country appear to be as follows : (a) the presence of 73,000 non-interned enemy aliens and 164,000 non-enemy aliens. In addition, there are recently naturalised British subjects of German origin from selected groups and possessing special qualifications;(b) the British Union of Fascists (8,700 subscribing members, organised in 188 districts, each of which has a leader);(c) the Communist Party of Great Britain (well organised, with 20,000pledged subscribing members. The Daily Worker circulation is90,000);(d) the Irish Republican Army (strength in United Kingdom unknown);(e) miscellaneous organisations and individuals and crews of ships.*Direct evidence is difficult to obtain, but we think it probable that tlhe enemy has an organisation drawn from members of the above categories which would act in his support at the appropriate moment, as in other invaded countries.As it is our considered opinion that Germany will do her utmost to achievevictory before next winter, the possibility of a direct attack on this country isnot to be dismissed, and its prospect of success would be far greater if it wasassisted by a &quot; Fifth Column,&quot; supported, as this well might be, by enemy troopsor agents dropped by parachute.We have been greatly impressed by the evidence available of the success which Germany has achieved in other countries through the careful organisationand with the assistance of subversive elements in those countries. We feel thatit should be, in the light of that success, a matter for most urgent and carefulscrutiny whether the present precautions against such a success in this country are adequate. We suggest that the standard by which this question should be judged is the strong probability of subversive action at a critical moment whenthe enemy is engaged in a direct military operation against this country.We feel it essential, in this connection, to stress that our present defence against the &quot;Fifth Column&quot; depends firstly upon the degree to which aliensand persons known to belong to subversive organisations. can, be adequatelycontrolled by the police, and secondly, whether adequate legal powers exist totake precautionary action against individuals in the categories mentioned aboveat any moment considered desirable.We fully realise that high political considerations arise in regard to takingfirm action against aliens or interfering with the liberty of British subjects.Nevertheless, in our opinion the safety of the State must come first, and all theevidence shows that action deferred till an emergency arises has been and willbe too late.(Signed) V.

Among the principal agencies of this kind should, however, benoted (a) German Embassies, Legations and Consulates.(b) German Press Bureaux.(c) German Travel Bureaux.B. At whom are these activities directed?German subversive activities abroad are naturally directed, in the first place,to any organised political parties or groups who possess sympathies and aimsdirectly or indirectly akin to those of National Socialism in Germany itself.Holland provides a particularly good example, and there is good circum-stantial evidence that the Dutch Nazi (N.S.B.) leaders in that country have beenin regular touch with the Nazi Party Organisation in Germany, and that theyhave received very considerable sums of money from German sources, notably theGerman Legation in The Hague.Where no organised political party of this kind exists, the Germans devotetheir energies to fostering and cultivating any movement or group of personswho for one reason or another are disaffected against the Government or regimeof the country in which they reside. Minority movements are a speciality forinstance, the Flamingants in Belgium or the Croats in Yugoslavia. In bothNorway and Denmark before the German invasion there were to be foundnumerous army circles (and in Denmark the police) who both disliked and despisedthe advanced Social Democrat Governments in power in those countries.Another favourite avenue of approach is that towards Youth Movements.These offer a wide scope for handling. In some cases (in conjunction with theegregious Travel Bureaux) it is possible to arrange for an interchange of travel facilities, involving a &quot; conducted tour &quot; of Germany with suitable propaganda.In other cases it is possible to invoke common ideas of physical fitness and the like, and to inculcate the Hitler claim to create a New World for Youth. Thereis good reason to believe that German University students, after receiving special training, are planted in foreign Universities to spread the Nazi gospel, and it issaid, for instance, that Ghent is definitely suspect from this angle.Social contacts provide many opportunities, especially where there are ties of blood with Germany; in Belgium, for example, there were many inter-marriageswith Germans during the last war. This is an appropriate place to allude tothe value, from the German standpoint, of friendship Societies with Germany.Their influence in many countries, perhaps notably Sweden, is believed to be considerable, particularly in so far as their members are in a position to exerciseinfluence upon Governmental and other circles.Industries in the countries bordering Germany have always been linkedclosely with German firms and German trade. It 4s perhaps hardly necessaryto enlarge on the opportunities thus presented for German influence, thoughBelgium is said to be particularly open to this, there being a number of firmswith headquarters in Brussels or Antwerp functioning through a purely Belgianorganisation but with German directors or control. An interesting sidelightis that the German War Graves Organisation serves: as a cover for an intensiveconnection with Belgian horticulturists and florists.&quot; &apos; - ; : &apos;        -    .
C. What are the methods and aims?These can be described in essentials quite shortly. The methods have beeninfiltration under cover of bribery and intimidation, the aims being to paralyseopposition by an intensive preparation based on these methods which at the critical moment results in the Home authorities being paralysed and deprived of the power of control.These statements require some illustration.In Denmark, ever since the beginning of the war, the Germans had spreadstories of the efficiency of the German Intelligence Service, of the network ofGerman spies in Denmark, and of the existence of a Black List for firms and individuals who were pro-Ally or who had traded with the Allies. At the sametime propaganda was spreading that German &quot; protection &quot; would not be a badthing for Denmark, and that they would never subject a proud, Nordic people likethe Danes to the treatment reserved for an &quot; inferior &quot; people like the Poles orthe Czechs.The result of a prolonged dose of this treatment when the German invasioncame was to make the Danes feel, mainly through fear and without losing theirpro-Ally feelings, that all resistance to Germany was futile and that they had better vie with one another in fulfilling the invader&apos;s demands.As regards preparations for sabotage, a good example of Nazi thoroughnessis shown by what was planned in Poland. Apart from the usual intensive study of local conditions and history throughout the country and the establishmentof a network of agents at key points (notably at telephone exchanges) numbersof men who were either to be dropped in Poland by parachute or normallyresided there were specially trained in sabotage, provided with uniforms assoldiers, railway officials, &amp;c, and given elaborate instructions ranging fromdemolition work and the cutting of telephone wires to the indication of targetsby prearranged signals.D.  What are the results?The locus classicus for the result of a successful preparation of the groundby subversive methods is probably to be found in the German invasion of Norway.A few selected instances of what happened on the invasion of both denmark and Norway may make the general picture more graphic, as well as illustratingthe fruition of the various schemes, the nature of which has been described above.(1) Denmark.The members of German travel agencies directed German troops to keypositions.Telephone exchanges were out of action or in German hands shortly afterthe German troops crossed the frontier.. The German troops landed near Copenhagen were transported to the cityin the coal lorries of two German firms.Finally, there is the question of the approach to individuals. These may be approached through one or other of the channels already referred to, or they maybe dealt with as individuals on the footing of (a) personal ties with Germany;(b) monetary considerations; (c) blackmail exercised on individuals, even thoughbona fide refugees, whose relations remain in the power of the Gestapo inGermany or in German-occupied territory. In either case the position of theGerman refugee calls for consideration. While the bona fides of many (perhaps the majority) of these refugees is unquestionable (and is substantiated by the factthat Germans are believed to be despatched as teachers abroad with a view tofurnishing reports on the activities of Jews and refugees), there is also reasonto believe that refugees are sometimes deliberately planted abroad, notably inorder to establish channels of influence (in which money may circulate) in industrial and financial circles. Whether they be refugees or not, there seemslittle doubt that all residents of German blood or with German marriage ties are regarded by those in control as potential units of influence, whether or not their activities remain dormant till the hoped for day dawns.
(2) Norway.Contradictory orders were given to Norwegian forts and arsenals : and alsoorders which interfered with Norwegian mobilisation, thus making it seem thatthe Germans had a knowledge of Norwegian mobilisation procedure.The telephone exchanges were early in German hands, and military com-munications were cut. 1German troops were smuggled in in merchant ships and, in several cases,wore Norwegian uniform. &apos;&apos; - :-Norwegian munition factories and arsenals were captured by the Germansso early as to presuppose an exact knowledge of their location and defences.A special section of the German Intelligence Service was charged with thefunctions (utilised to the fullest extent in the invasion in Norway) of spreadingfalse reports regarding German intentions and misleading statements as to the objectives for contemplated operations.Finally, it is of great importance to note that these detailed plans were most carefully concealed until the moment of putting them into force and that therewas no premature disclosure of any kind.
