I circulate herewith a note containing:-(a) a forecast of the aircraft production figures ofGreat Britain, France and Germany up to(i) 30th June, 1940 (ii) 30th September, 1940.(b) an appreciation of the air personnel situation forthe same period.(c) a forecast of the expansion in operational strengthup to 30th June, 1940.2.     As in previous papers on this subject32 the figures oJ?production are based on the assumption that factories will notbe hampered by air attack over the period.     The estimate of increase of operational strength is limited to the next threemonths, and corresponds, in this respect, with the procedurefollowed in W.P.(40) 7*      In order to furnish an estimate eventhree months ahead, it is necessary to make certain arbitraryassumptions, regarding the development of operations and the incidence of wastage, and I am satisfied that no useful purpose would be served by an attempt to estimate over a longer period.3.      In view of the highly secret character of this paper,I would ask that all copies may be returned to the Cabinet office as soon as possible after consideration by the War Cabinet,Air Ministry.

sThe Air Strengths of Great Britain, France and Germany.Production (Great Britain)1.     The estimated production figures for the months ofJune and September, 1940, are as follows:-June 1940       September 1940Bombers                                                    251 269Fighters                                                    222 283General Reconnaissance                       .    80 8UArmy Co-operation                                    56 78&apos;Fleet Air Arm                                         46 54Trainers36                                                I+53 575Miscellaneous                                             3 3feEAfc: 1111 13462* These estimates have been calculated having regard tothe various factors governing production., and should be capableof attainment provided that no unforeseen circumstances supervene.3*      The figures quoted in paragraph 1 do not includeforecasted deliveries from*-the United States of America and canada,     The latest forecasts of deliveries of operationaltypes from these countries for the months in question are:-June 1.940       September 1 940United States:    Hudson (general reconnaissance) 20 25Brewster (Fighter)       11 11Canada: Hurricane (Fighter)       6 9Lysander (army co-operation) 4 9Hampden (Bomber) 0 2TOTAL: 41 5636The figures for trainers include:-June, 1940 :    90 Battles and 60 Aasons;September, 1940 :    54 Battles and 72 Ansons.Battle aircraft being produced at this stage will not be used for operational purposes and are therefore excluded from the bombertotals.     The number of Anson aircraft included in the general reconnaissance totals for June and September is that required tomaintain Anson squadrons existing on the dates in question.     Thebalance of -Alison production is earmarked for training.

&apos;       -       7.3. &quot;&apos;p^qduction (France)it.     In paragraph 6 of W.P.(hO) 7 it was stated that theFrench Production Mission had estimated French production for themonth of March, 1940, as 781 aircraft.     It was added that,although an official forecast was not available for deliveriesbetween March and June, 1940, information obtained from theFrench Air Staff suggested that total French production was expected to rise to something over 900 aircraft a month by june, 1940.     In commenting on these figures, it was pointedout that although the French were now tackling the problem of aircraft production on far more realistic lines than formerly,the forecasts for March and June seemed over-optimistic andunlikely to be achieved.     Actual deliveries during the monthsof January and February 1940, were 388 and 355 respectively asagainst estimates of i+Ti and. 631 *5*     Even allowing for the exceptionally severe weather conditions during January and February the discrepancy isconsiderable, and it seems clear that the official Frenchforecast for the month of June, 1940, which amounts to 1096aircraft, must be treated with reserve.     It is thoughtthat the rate of output in the months of June and September, 1940cannot confidently be put higher than:-June 1940 September jJ&amp;OBombers 160 200Bighters 120 130Army Go-operation 120 130Naval 30 hOTrainers 150 240580 840The above figures do not include importations from america, of which details are not yet available.     Figuresprovided by the French in respect of shipping requirementsindicate that the anticipated deliveries are of the order of180 aircraft in June and 160 in September.

Production (Germany).6.-..   As a result of a comprehensive study undertaken by theAir Ministry and the Ministry of Economic Warfare of all theavailable information obtained from various sources just prior to,and since, the war, it was estimated that German production inJanuary, 1940, was at the rate of 1245 aircraft a month, of which975 were first line types,-   This estimate was almost identical with that of the French Air Staff which had been arrived atindependently.    It was further estimated that the maximumpotential output of existing factories might be between 2,200 and2,400 a month, but that this figure could not be reached until :September, 1940, at the earliest.    In the light of presentcalculations, however, it appears unlikely that this output could now be reached until the end.of 1940 or the beginning of 1941,mainly owing to the difficulty of training the necessary skilled labour.    Another factor which has undoubtedly led to the retar-dation of normal expansion, if not to a temporary decrease inproductionwas the abnormally severe winter experienced inJanuary and February, which must have caused serious delays inthti transport of materials and a shortage of fuel, although itis probablg that the armament industry received priority ofsupplies over domestic requirements..7.-     With regard to. the other limiting factors mentioned inparagraphs 8 and 9 of W.P. (40)7, it appears that the calling up of reservists from the industry has been kept to a minimum..Regarding the change-over to newer types, although there are indications of the existence of certain prototypes,  it seems unlikely that their-series production has yet been introduced.8.     From the foregoing, it appears&quot;that output is unlikely,to exceed 1700 a month (including 1550 first line types) during june 1940 and 2000 a month (including 1555 first line types)during September,  1940, on the continued assumption that noextensive preparation is made for the change-over to new types.

personnel (Metropolitan Air Force.)9.     The total numbers required.to fill established postsfor flying personnel and skilled tradesmen, estimated on knowncommitments to 30th June, 1940, which will have to be maintained during the period up to 30th September, 1940, are as follows;-.Flying Personnel.Pilots (including General 13,950Duties Officers)Observers 1,500Air Gunners 4,250Skilled Tradesmen.Fitter Group 39,900Wireless and Electrical Group 13,000Instrument Group 2,100Armament Group 5,600The requirements stated above do not include any allowance for expansion of first line strength after 30th June, 1940, because,,as explained elsewhere in this paper, the scale of expansionpossible after that date cannot yet be forecasted..10.     The general personnel position is satisfactory.    Onthe assumption that the present rate of wastage continues, therewill be appreciable surpluses over the above requirements.    Ifwastage occurs at the level of sustained effort, the above re-quirements will be maintained with a bare margin in-most classes.11.,     In the technical trade groups a measure of dilutionof the highly skilled trades must continue, notably in the wireless and electrical and instrument groups.    The situationcan, however, be regarded as acceptable.Operational Strength of the Metropolitan Air Force on 51stMarch. 1940&quot; &apos;&quot;      &quot;       -12.     It was estimated in W.P.  (40) V that the operationalstrength of the Metropolitan Air Force would rise to 127squadrons totalling 2,038 aircraft by 31st March 1940..   Theproduction forecast on which this estimate was based was dulyrealised, but it proved only possible to increase the operationalstrength to 117 squadrons .of approximately 1,840 aircraft,--

in the reasons why the forecast was not realised are as set out below,1^     The Scandinavian Project.     Although only some 140first line aircraft were directly involved they had to be organised on a fully mobile basis independent of the homemaintenance organisation:    the inroads on available supplies of operational equipment and maintenance personnel were in conse-quence far more extensive than   the number of aircraft would suggest.      The aircraft concerned are,  of course, now being returned to the Metropolitan role, but the major diversion of effort involved inevitably resulted in a serious interferencewith the Metropolitan programme,14.      Aircraft for Finland,      A total of 95 aircraft were sent to Finland during the period and 93 more were prepared for despatch^      As with the Scandinavian project, the diversion of effort involved in the Maintenance Command was far greater thanthe numbers would suggests15.      A i r c r a ft u f or.....Canada.,     &apos;Some 40 aircraft which were tohave been used to increase the initial equipment of certain general reconnaissance squadrons were diverted to Canada forthe purposes of the Empire Training&apos;scheme a.16.,     Equipmente     A shortage occurred in certain items ofancillary equipment0*     Energetic steps have been taken to remedy the position and an early improvement is anticipated,but the rate at which aircraft can be introduced into the line was affected by this factor over the past quarter and will beaffected during the next few months.Iff* In addition production of engines lagged slightly behindrequirements, but this did not result in any delay in theprogramme .

1 117.      In sum the progress made on the five measures out-lined in paragraph 15 of W.P.  (40) 7 has been as follows(a) 11, instead of 14, of the 18 fighter squadronsformed after the outbreak of war can be regardedas fit at present to take their place in the operational total.(b) The strength of all operational heavy bomber squadrons was duly raised from 12 to 16 initialequipment aircraft each,(e) The! proposed increase in strength of the Army Co-operation squadrons from 12 to 18 initial equipmentaircraft was duly effected.(d) For the reason given at paragraph 15 above the increase in strength of five General Reconnaissance squadrons to 21 initial equipment aircraft each was noteffected..(e) Four only of the 11 squadrons originally classified asnon-operational were brought up to operationalstrength by the 31st March.Forecast of Operational Strength of the Metropolitan AirForce on the 50th June, 1940.18.     The temporary setbacks described in paragraphs 13 - 16will of course be made up and by the 30th June,  1940 it isanticipated that the operational strength of the MetropolitanAir Force will amount to 156 squadrons of 2,146 aircraft.     this total includes one Royal Canadian Air Force Squadron (Army Co-operation) and one Royal Australian Air Force Squadron (general reconnaissance).     The forecast is based on the following assumptions:-(a) that the scale of effort called for over the ensuingquarter corresponds broadly with that maintainedover the past quarter;/(b)

The German strength at the same date isestimated at 5,350 aircraft.Summary.20. The comparative strengths of Great Britain, Franceand Germany at the beginning and end of the quarter are thusforecasted as follows;-
