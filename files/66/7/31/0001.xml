Tracer cartridges are sO called because they leave a visible wake or&quot;trace&quot; behind them so that the trajectory can be seen. They are used toascertain visually where the bullets are going with the object of correcting the aim. The &quot; trace &quot; is obtained by filling the bullet with a chemical which burnsduring flight.2. The legal aspect of the use of tracer ammunition is as follows:  (i) The International Declaration renouncing the use in time of war of explosive projectiles under 400 grams in weight signed at St. Peters-burg on nth December (N.S.), 1868, prohibits the use of &quot; anyprojectile of a weight below 400 grams which is either explosive orcharged with fulminating or inflammable substances &quot;. Great Britain,France and Germany were parties to this Convention.(ii) Article 23 (e) of the Hague Rules, 1907, prohibits the use of projectilesor material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering.(iii) Express legalisation of the use of tracer by and against aircraft was contemplated by Article 18 of the abortive Hague Rules relating toAerial Warfare, 1923.3. The Committee of Imperial Defence, at their 229th Meeting on 14th July,1927, placed on record their opinion that the use of tracer ammunition did notinfringe the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868 or the Hague Rules of 1907.Consequently trials were carried out in the British Army, and scales of tracerammunition to be carried by infantry, machine-gun and armoured fightingvehicle units were laid down.4. After the outbreak of the present war the legality of using tracer ammuni-tion against ground targets was discussed between G.H.Q., British ExpeditionaryForce, and G.Q.G., French Army. It was then ascertained that the Frenchintended using it against aircraft only, although its introduction for range-findingwas under consideration. The latest information received from the allied military Committee on the use of tracer ammunition in the French Army isgiven in the Appendix. It indicates that tracer ammunition is not at present usedin armoured fighting vehicles, but is used for rifles and machine-guns and someanti-tank guns.5. A recent German book &quot; Panzer Nach Vorn &quot;, which contains a collectionof narratives from German tank corps men on their experiences in the campaign in Poland, and a report prepared by the Polish General Staff on the sameI [campaign make it clear that-tracer &quot;ammunition was used by German armoured1 lighting vehicle units in Poland with great effect. The use of tracer ammunitionSis, in fact, essential for armoured fighting vehicles in order to obtain observationfrom the restricted field of vision of a tank in action, and our tank units wouldbe at a grave disadvantage when operating against German troops using tracer,unless they also were so equipped.6. In these circumstances my colleagues may like to know that approvalhas been given to the use of tracer ammunition by British armoured fighting vehicles.O.F.G.S.The War Office,10th May, 1940.
APPENDIXINFORMATION RECEIVED FROM THE ALLIED MILITARY COMMITTEE ON THEPOSITION AS REGARDS THE USE OF TRACER AMMUNITION  BY  THE  french army.i. In the case of light (7-5-mm.) and medium machine-guns (8-mm.) the use of tracerammunition is laid down as a normal practice against airppaft only. This limitation is based upontechnical considerations only. Tracer is included in the normal supplies for rifles and machine-guns, although these vveappns are only used for anti-aircraft action as a secondary role.2. At present, the 25-mm. anti-tank our uses both arrnour-piercing and a type of ammunitionwhich combines armour-piercing and tracer.  This latter type is to become the standard ammunition.3. 13-2-mm. and.25-mm. guns in fortified areas use the armour-piercing tracer ammunition.4. Guns mounted in armoured fighting vehicles are. not, at present, supplied with tracerammunition, but the question is now under consideration.5. In general terms, it appears that the authorities allow, in fact, the use of srnall calibre tracerammunition against ground targets.(b40/8)   60  5/40  W.O.P.  5252
