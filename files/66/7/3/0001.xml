naval SITUATION.General Review.THERE has been a complete lull in German submarine activity. enemy aircraft attacks on warships and merchant vessels have somewhat increased in intensity, though not in effectiveness.Home Waters.2. The main units of the Home Fleet have been at Scapa Flow during thepast week and no major movements have taken place. French submarines arenow working with our patrols in the North Sea.3. About dusk on the 28th March enemy aircraft were active over a wide area. The homeward Norwegian convoy, when east of the Shetlands, was twiceattacked, 90 minutes elapsing between the two attacks. Five bombs were droppedwithout result, but a fishing trawler in the same area was also bombed and damaged by a near miss. About the same time H.M. A/S Trawler Wistariaand a fishing trawler off Kinnaird Head were attacked and slightly damaged,while in the South, off Ostend, French destroyers were bombed without result.4. On the 29th March, again about dusk, the north-bound convoy from the thames was attacked by aircraft off Flamborough Head, only two bombs were dropped and H.M.S. Flamingo, one of the escorts, was hit by machine-gun fire;there were no casualties. Forty minutes later the Tyne Methil convoy was bombed off Blyth without effect, and one German aircraft was brought down.5. On the afternoon of the 2nd April the outward Norwegian convoy andone section of the homeward Norwegian convoy (a total of about 50 shipsexcluding escorts) were attacked when they were close to each other to the north-east of the Orkneys. H.M.S. Sheffield, one of the escorting cruisers, were attacked by machine-gun fire, and two bombs fell within 250 yards of her, but no damage or casualties resulted. At the same time the other section of the homewardNorwegian convoy to the eastward of Wick and H.M. Destroyer Isis in the MorayFirth were also attacked.  In all instances the aircraft were driven off by gunfire.At dusk some 15-18 enemy aircraft unsuccessfully attacked Scapa Flow. Somebombs fell in Gutter Sound and one on land, and it is thought possible thatmines were dropped in certain areas in the approaches. One enemy aircraft isbelieved to have been damaged by gunfire.6. On the afternoon of the 3rd April the outward Norwegian convoy was attacked for 1-f hours by six enemy aircraft, one and possibly two of whichwere accounted for by the escorting Sunderland Flying boat. The convoy wasabout 450 miles from the nearest German aerodrome at the time of the attack.Foreign Waters.7. The Russian ships Selenga and V. Malakovsky, which were interceptedon the 15th January and the 15th March respectively, were released from HongKong on the 29th March and were then ordered by French warships to proceedto Saigon for examination. The Russian crews refused to work their ships andwere replaced by French sailors.A report of H.M.S. Ramillies, recently employed escorting the Australiantroop convoys, shows that during December 1939 she steamed 9,500 miles at anaverage speed of 16-1 knots, her fastest run being one of 1,760 miles at 19-2knots. Her average annual mileage for eight years preceding the war was under7,000 miles.The S.S. Queen Mary has arrived at Capetown, and the S.S. Mauretania atHonolulu.German Intelligence.&amp;. The present disposition of German main units appears to be asfollows :  Baltic Ports Cruisers Bliicher, Prinz Eugen, Leipzig, Karlsruhe, Emden.[21094] &apos; B
North Sea Ports Battle-cruisers Gneisenau, Scharnhorst.Pocket Battleship Admiral Scheer.Cruisers Hipper, Niirnbvrg, koln and probably Konigsberg.No reliable news can be obtained of the Lutzow (ex-Deutschland). Reportsstate that she has been in several North Sea and Baltic ports, but none of these reports appear reliable.Two capital ships, believed to be the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau, were reported by aircraft at anchor off Wilhehnshaven at 0800 the 4th April.Few U-boats appear to have been at sea during the period and these only inthe North Sea.It is estimated that on the 4th April 2 were possibly to the West of Scotland, outward bound,1 in Moray Firth, and1 on patrol off Orkneys and Shetlands.Anti-Submarine Operations.9. Very few reliable reports of submarines have been received during theweek, and only six hunts have been carried out, all of which were probably on&quot; non-submarine &quot; targets.No attacks were made by aircraft.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. A. total of 1,028 ships, of which 45 were Allied and 305 Neutral, were convoyed during the week, only one of which (a neutral) was sunk. Included inthis total was a convoy of 61 ships from Halifax under Rear-Admiral E. 0.Cochrane as Commodore. This is the largest convoy that has reached the UnitedKingdom, and its total tonnage was nearly 400,000 tons.Fifty-one destroyers (including three French), twenty-one escort vessels, sixcruisers, five armed merchant cruisers, two battleships and one submarine were employed oh: escort duty.Imports in convoy were above the average and included nearly 300,000 tonsof oil; 140,000 tons of minerals and ores, over 180,000 tons of cereals and nearly140,000 tons of other food-stuffs.Since the outbreak of war 15,751 ships have been convoyed, of which 778were Allied and 2,446 Neutral. Twenty-nine ships have been lost in convoy or one in 543; for Neutral vessels one in 815.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. Only one ship, the Norwegian S.S. Burgos (3,219 tons), has been lostduring the period, and she was sunk by a mine whilst in convoy, due to -her beingmiles outside the swept channel.In addition to the attacks on convoys, several trawlers and one smallmerchant ship have been bombed and machine gunned by aircraft, two trawlersreporting damage and casualties. Details of attacks are given in Appendix I.Interrogation of the crews of small ships and trawlers emphasise the moral support afforded by their Lewis gun armament and the results of recent attackssuggest that this has a very practical value.A diagram of shipping losses arranged on a monthly basis has been attachedto this resume; this brings out the point, not so apparent in the weekly figures,that the heaviest total losses occurred in February 1940.German Mine-laying.12. There is little definite intelligence of German mine-laying during thepast week, but an area in Scapa Flow and another off South Ronaldshay areclosed because of suspected mine-laying by aircraft. At about dusk on the2nd April a very large splash from a low-flying bomber was observed about 3 miles north-west of Stroma Light. There are definite indications that magnetic mines have been backed up by moored mines laid either by aircraft, scoots or motorboats.
British Mine Sweeping.13. Routine mine-sweeping on the lines shown in last week&apos;s Summarycontinued during the week. The centre of interest in the past week has still beenbetween the Downs and the Dutch and Belgian ports. Sweeping continued untilthe 30th March, when traffic was released, but on the 31st March more mines wereswept up and traffic was again stopped. It was released again in the evening ofthe 1st April.  Fourteen mines were swept in all in this area during the week.14. A number of the German moored mines swept up recently appear tohave an explosive cutter which cuts the sweep wire when it gets into it. Thiswill increase the difficulties of mine-sweeping.In the magnetic mine area south of the Cromer Knoll the tugs Servitor andShako, sweeping with a LL. sweep, exploded one mine in the north-easternextreme of the area. Both vessels developed defects as a result. A pair ofLL. trawlers operating in the declared dangerous area off Orfordness on the1st and 2nd April exploded eight mines. The trawlers were fitted with a newCallender cable which has a safety margin of 125 yards, and no damage was done to either vessel or gear.15. HM.S. Sutton, of the Fourth Mine-Sweeping Flotilla, was damaged aftby a mine exploding under her stern near the Cromer Light Vessel on the30th March. It appears that the sweep fouled the mine-mooring wire, but thecutter did not operate. The mine and sinker were towed on the sweep for somedistance, and the sweep was then hove in and a mine appeared on the surfaceclose under the stern. The engines were put to full ahead, and this apparentlycaused the mooring to part and the mine to explode.16. The total number of mines swept and exploded by sweepers to date is313 moored mines and 91 magnetic mines. The latter were accounted for in thefollowing ways : 121 by H.M.S. Borde a ship fitted with a powerful magnet in the bows thatexplodes the mines before they are reached.17 by the magnetic SAveep which consists of magnets attached to a wire towedbetween two ships.16 by the D.W.I. an aeroplane which flies low and carries a dynamo drivenby a special petrol engine which produces a very powerful magnetic field.15 by skids small boats towed astern of drifters or trawlers which produce a powerful magnetic field from a coil.14 by LL. sweep, which consists of electrodes towed from trawlers or tugs.Two ships work in conjunction and a powerful pulsating electric currentflows through the sea between the electrodes.Three more mines have been recovered and five have been detonated bymiscellaneous methods.German Merchant Shipping.17. Two of the German ships which escaped from Curacao on the night ofthe 4th/5th March have reappeared. The Mimi Horn, 4,007 tons, was intercepted by H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Transylvania on the 29th March in DenmarkStrait when she scuttled herself. The Seattle, 6,000 tons, arrived at Tromsoe,Norway, on the 31st March, and sailed southward on the 1st April.18. In northern waters the German trade from Narvik with iron-ore hasbeen resumed after the holiday. There were eight enemy ships in that port onthe 2nd April, six of which had arrived since the 29th March. It is as yet too early to judge of the rumours of a falling off in this traffic as the delay in sailing from Narvik may be accounted for by a variety of factors, among them thepresence of some ten British ships at that port. Elsewhere the trade to otherScandinavian ports continues active as before.19. There have been signs and rumours of activity among the twenty-sevenGerman ships which are sheltering in Adriatic ports. One of these, the A nkara,4,768 tons, left Trieste on the 27th March, and proceeded to Dubrovnik, where she loaded bauxite. It has been suggested that the purpose of this trade may beto provide return freights for the coal trade passing from Germany to Italy underthe new trrde agreement.[21094] b 2
In the Dutch East Indies there are continued signs of preparation for ageneral attempt on the part of the German ships to escape. The ships are nowloaded and ready to sail, and are paying off, or have paid off, the debts for whichthey have been held attached. Nine ships are already free of their attachments,and three more will probably be so in a day or two. It has been suggested thatthese ships intend to make for Vladivostok.Of the 220 German ships in neutral ports other than those in the Baltic and scandinavia, 59 are in American ports, 44 in Asiatic waters, 43 are in Spain,40 in Italy, and 34 in African ports.Economic Warfare.20. During the week ending the 30th March, 1,200 tons of cargo destined for germany were seized in prize. The main items were 800 tons of base metalsand manufactures thereof, 150 tons of food products and beverages; the rest wasmade up of oils, fats, rubber, gums, wood and paper.During the same week the Contraband Committee considered the cargoes of100 ships which had arrived since the 23rd March, and 28 outstanding cargoesfrom the previous week. In 68 cases the entire cargoes were released either on first consideration or after enquiries.Nomenclature of British War Vessels.21.   The following revised nomenclature has been approved by the Boardof Admiralty for smaller naval vessels and will be adopted in future resumes : &quot;Destroyers&quot; for fast escort vessels (a new class under construction)and for destroyers which have been converted into escort vessels.&quot; Sloop &quot; for escort vessels other than the above.&quot; Corvettes &quot; for Whalers, and patrol vessels of the &quot; Kittiwake &quot; class,i.e., ships intermediate between Sloops and Trawlers.M.L.&apos;s: Motor launches of the &quot; Fairmile &quot; type.Italy.22. Information has been received during the last week reporting the calling-up of a number of naval reservists. The extent of this calling-up is not known, but it is certain that a number of reservists have been called up to manthe coastal defences at Venice, Tobruk, and Lero, and probably at many other places.- Our Naval Attache in Rome was informed that these reservists called up are mostly specialists, and that they are being called up for training during the FleetExercises.  He was assured that normal procedure was being followed.There are no other signs of any increased degree of readiness in the navy.Conditions in the Fleet are quiet; the First Squadron is now at Taranto after having completed its Adriatic cruise; the Second Squadron has remained at Gaetaafter completing exercises.   W/T and P/L traffic remains normal.Japan.23. The combined fleet, comprising some 50 ships, arrived off Amoy on the31st March. They sailed on the 1st April it is believed for Keelund in NorthFormosa. As far as is known there is no political or strategical significance inthis move, which is probably part of the normal spring manoeuvres.MILITARY SITUATION,Western Front.24. During the past week there has been an increase in patrol activity.Several French posts have been unsuccessfully attacked, and in many cases theFrench captured prisoners. A novel feature has been the machine-gunning bylow-flying German aircraft of French troops. This occurred on two occasions,one in forward positions and one on a road some miles behind the front.The greater part of the 44th Division has now arrived in France; and theBritish Expeditionary Force has taken over a further sector of the front.
Communications.26. Bridging activity continues on the Rivers Our and Sure, as well as onthe Saar, Mosel and Rhine.Distribution.27.   The distribution of German divisions is now believed to be as follows :  	Cav. 1 i	Armd.	Lt.	Mot.	Inf.	Total.Western Theatre Central Germany Baltic Coast, including Corridor and East Prussia Poland, excluding Corridor ... Bohemia-Moravia Austria Slovakia		7 1	3 1	7*	Min.    90 Max. 106 , Max.   23 Min.     7 8 19 5 4 1	Min. 108 Max. 124 Max.   23 Min.     7 8 20 6 5 1	2	8	4	7	150	171* Including three S.S. and Police divisions.Italy.28. A rumour of general mobilisation in Italy may be due to the largenumber of recruits, some 400,000, called up in March, and to the reportedsuspension of leave from the 1st April. There are, at present, however, no indications of the recall of the large number of reservists which generalmobilisation would involve.Apart from any political motives that may underlie the rumour of generalmobilisation, it may be noted that while Italian man power is adequate and armament and equipment are sufficient for the mobilisation of an Army of somej^,..,,...tr1,000,000 men, there appear to be no reserves of/ljJsBs s4*Br on a war wastage scale./ o^-jlA. A. s^-p^M^r,Italian East Africa.29. At the end of March the rebel chief Abebe Aragai was routed by an italian force about 25 miles south of Ancober. Casualties were suffered on bothsides. Abebe Aragai with a small following is believed to be making for FrenchSomaliland.Far East.30. In North China, the Chinese gained a temporary success on the20th March by the recapture of Wuyuan, the advanced Japanese post in Suiyuan,when they inflicted heavy casualties on the garrison. This garrison was largelycomposed of Mongol levies with a small stiffening of Japanese troops. Wuyuanwas re-occupied by the Japanese on the 26th March, after the arrival of reinforce-ments from rail-head at Paotou.Germany.Troop Movements.25. The majority of the troop movements reported during the week appear-to refer to normal changes and reliefs. The withdrawal of tank units from thearea opposite the Dutch frontier is reported by more than one source, but thereis every indication of a strong concentration, including tank units, remaining inthe small area Kleve-Wesel; the troops in this area may even have receivedreinforcements. The reported presence of several hospital trains in this area isalso to be noted.Several heavy guns on railway mountings are reported in the immediatevicinity of Aachen.
In South China, operations in the Nanning area of Kwangsi are spreadingwestwards towards the Indo-China border. Two columns of Japanese troops aremoving by road and river towards Lungchow, about 90 miles south-west ofNanning.   Approximately two Japanese brigades are involved.Elsewhere the situation remains unchanged, except that the Japanesemopping-up operations in territory adjacent to Portuguese Macao have given rise to some complications.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.Offensive Operations and Reconnaissances.31. It is now learned that the aircraft which was reported last week tohave been shot down by Dutch fighters on the 28th trespassed on Dutch territorythrough a navigational error and was driven down without offering resistance.One of the crew was killed and the other four have been interned.In spite of generally unfavourable weather conditions, daylight recon-reconnaissances in force over the Heligoland Bight have been regularly maintained by Blenheim aircraft, in search of enemy warships. Fifteen aircraft were employed each day from the 29th to 31st March, nine on the 1st April andtwo each on the 3rd and 4th April. No definite hits are claimed but enemy vessels were seen and bombed on several occasions. Pour bombs were aimed atone of a pair of patrol vessels which opened fire at our aircraft on the 30th March,and four at one of a flotilla of four similar vessels on the 1st April. No opposi-tion was encountered on any of these occasions, except from the anti-aircraft fire ofthe ships, and only one enemy fighter was seen; one of our aircraft failed to return.32. An effective reconnaissance was made in cloudy weather on the28th March when photographs were taken, of the River Elbe and the naval base at Cuxhaven. A Tuatfcla cruiser of the &quot;Hipper class,&quot; two destroyers, twenty-four minesweepers and patrol vessels of various types, and various merchantvessels and small naval units have been identified from the photographs. three enemy fighters were seen and evaded.On&quot; the 1st April a Blenheim aircraft engaged on a sweep in the western north Sea encountered a single Junkers 88 bomber about sixteen miles off the yorkshire coast, and attacked it, closing in to 100 feet. Three bursts of fireappeared to hit the root of the port wing, and another burst hit the fuselage and port engine, which emitted black smoke. The enemy aircraft then escaped incloud, and later reports indicate that it came down at sea.33. Two Blenheims took off approximately at 0400 hours on the morning ofthe 4th April for a reconnaissance of Cuxhaven and Wilhelmshaven. Aircraftreported that the cloud base was at 250 feet, from which height they observed two enemy capital ships believed to be the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau; the ships wereclose to the entrance of Wilhelmshaven Harbour heading north. At a result ofthis reconnaissance six Blenheims were detailed to attack the ships, but, onaccount of unsuitable weather conditions, were unable to take off until 1530hours. The visibility over the enemy base was very bad and four of the aircraft were unable to find the targets. Of the remaining two, one attacked a cruiser,and the other, four destroyers. Each dropped four 250-lb. bombs, but no hits were observed.Night Reconnaissances and Security Patrols.34. Patrols were maintained over the islands in the Heligoland Bight by two and four aircraft respectively on the nights, 30th-31st March andlst-2nd April. Reconnaissances of North-Western Germany were flown on thenights, 31st March-lst April, and lst-2nd April; fifteen aircraft were involved,and 2,245,000 leaflets were dropped, mainly in the Hamburg-Bremen-Kiel areas.
fThe blackout in the areas reconnoitred was on the whole poor; aerodrome lights,railway marshalling yards and the Bremen-Hamburg Autobahn were clearlyvisible from the air.Fighter Command.35. During the period under review 514 fighter patrols, involving 1,516aircraft, were carried out. Two enemy aircraft were destroyed. Enemy aircraft have been fairly active during the week over the North Sea and the Orkneys andShetlands, and a certain number of raids have been recorded each day. the bombing attacks delivered have, however, been somewhat half-hearted and entirelyunsuccessful.36. On the 28th March attempts were made on the inward Norwegianconvoy in the early afternoon by two aircraft, and again toward dusk by asingle aircraft. The outward convoy was also attacked off the North of scotland in the evening. Other attacks were reported on two trawlers, on the shipNorthern Coast, and on French destroyers off Ostend. All these raids were met by anti-aircraft and machine-gun fire, and no damage was done. Two Skuaaircraft of the Fleet Air Arm investigated a distress signal from a convoy whichwas being attacked by an enemy aircraft. This aircraft flew into cloud before -the fighters could get within range.There was again a good deal of enemy reconnaissance activity on the29th March, but the only attacks were made at dusk on two convoys off the York-shire coast. The enemy were driven off by anti-aircraft fire and one of them camedown in the sea in Cresswell Bay. On the 30th March there were no attacks,although a few raids were recorded at widely separated points, probably of enemy aircraft on reconnaissance.37. On the morning of the 31st March several enemy aircraft appeared nearScapa and were engaged by the anti-aircraft guns of our warships. Gladiators ofthe Fleet Air Arm went up in pursuit, and one Heinkel was engaged and pursuedsome 30 miles out to sea before it took refuge in cloud. A signal from an enemy aircraft was intercepted shortly after giving the message &quot; right enginedestroyed,&quot; but the aircraft in question eventually reached its base. Towardmidday another reconnaissance aircraft was intercepted some 80 miles off the norfolk coast by a section of Spitfires; the enemy aircraft, which was identified as a Dornier 17, dived steeply toward the sea when attacked, with black smokepouring from the starboard engine. After flattening out at sea level it flew offeastward with its right wing dipped.38. On the 1st April there were no incidents of interest, although a fewaircraft were active off the Kentish coast and in the neighbourhood of a convoyin that area during the night of the lst-2nd April. One aircraft was momentarilyheld by searchlights at Maidstone early in the morning of the 2nd April. Duringthe rest of that day activity was on a much larger scale, and several attacks wereattempted. Two Heinkel seaplanes were intercepted by three Hurricanes off,Norfolk, shortly after dawn; the upper gun position of one of the enemy aircraft was put out of action and it was later reported to have come down in the seawhere it subsequently sank. Its crew is believed to have been rescued by theother seaplane. Aircraft attacked four convoys in the Orkney area during the afternoon, and were driven off by anti-aircraft fire. Toward dusk an attempt was made to raid Scapa Flow by about twelve aircraft. They were met by heavyanti-aircraft fire, and it is claimed that at least one aircraft was hit. Wirelessintercepts suggest that two of the German aircraft failed to return. Of the bombs dropped, two fell on land, and were apparently 500 lb. bombs of the same typeas those used in the previous raid on Scapa : there was no damage. Attemptswere made to machine-gun searchlight positions and gun sites, and it is reportedthat the lighthouse on Duncansby Head, Caithness, was also machine-gunnedwithout damage.39. On the 3rd April the main enemy operation was an attempt by a formation of Junkers 88 to attack a convoy between the Shetlands and &apos; theNorwegian coast, to which reference is made under Coastal Command. Therewere, however, some sporadic attacks off the English coast during the day, and towards midday a Heinkel was intercepted off Whitby by a single Spitfire and
shot down in the sea. The crew, who were rescued, report that before thisinterception one of their engines had been put out of action by machine-gunfire from a trawler. The Spitfire concerned caught fire shortly after the combat,and came down in the sea: the pilot was rescued. It is not yet clear whetherthis casualty was due to enemy action. Another trawler which was attackedearly in the afternoon also claims to have done some damage to the aircraftconcerned. Earlier in the day two Heinkels had been intercepted off Kinnaird&apos;sHead by Skuas of the Fleet Air Arm, and three attacks had been made, withunknown results.Coastal Command.40. The number of routine and special patrols was somewhat reducedduring the week by adverse weather conditions, but convoy escorts were fullymaintained; fifty-nine escorts, involving 339 aircraft sorties, were provided.Among numerous sightings of merchant vessels was that of a 2,000-tonGerman vessel seen in Norwegian territorial waters on the 28th March; it wasmoving southward under escort by two Norwegian gunboats.41. Two German flying-boats and one other enemy aircraft were seen onthe 28th March. One of the flying-boats was attacked and driven down by aHudson on patrol some 160 miles from the Scottish coast. The engagement lastedabout half an hour, and attacks were pressed home to a range of fifty yards;in breaking away from one of these attacks a collision with the enemy wasnarrowly averted, and some damage was done to our aircraft by a burst of fire from his front gun. Some fifteen hundred rounds in all were fired, the enemyrear gunner was put out of action, and one of the flying boafs engines was badly damaged. Our aircraft was hit by about twelve bullets and one engine was damaged and stopped completely during the homeward flight.On the 2nd April a &apos;&apos; London &apos;&apos; flying boat on escort duty with the inward-bound Norwegian convoy sighted a Heinkel 111, which dropped four bombs and made off when a burst was fired at it at long range. On the 3rd April a Sunder-land flying-boat escort was provided for the outward-bound convoy. On receiptof reports that the convoy was being shadowed by enemy aircraft beyond the range of shore-based fighter protection, a second Sunderland was also sent out.The first of these flying-boats saw and engaged two enemy aircraft, and latersighted four more which bombed the convoy unsuccessfully and were driven off by accurate anti-aircraft fire. The second encountered two Junkers 88 bombers,which broke away after a short engagement in which the aircraft were flying onparallel courses about 100 feet above the water. Five minutes later four morebombers appeared and made a concerted attack on the Sunderland fromastern, while the first two attempted to bomb our aircraft from 1,500 feetabove. Our rear gunner withheld his fire until the leading enemy aircraft was within 100 yards, and then fired a burst, after which the enemy turned away and dived into the sea. A second Junkers 88 is reported to have taken refuge in norwegian territory with a damaged engine shortly after the time of this action,and this may also have been due to our fire. This aircraft was set on fire onlanding by the crew, who were subsequently interned.In the course of the day two Gladiators, based on the Shetlands, intercepteda Heinkel which was attacking a ship east of the islands. Our aircraft openedfire at 400 yards, closing to a hundred yards, but the enemy aircraft succeeded in evading further pursuit, and was not obviously damaged.British Air Forces in France.42. Fifty-six patrols were flown by fighters of the Air Component, and forty-two by those of the Advanced Air Striking Force. The latter were involvedin several considerable engagements during the week. During the morning ofthe 29th March, three Hurricanes on patrol engaged a Dornier 17 and drove it down from 19,000 feet to 2,000 feet. It was last seen diving steeply into lowclouds in the direction of Germany. Later in the morning, another section ofthree Hurricanes encountered a formation of five Messerschmitt 109&apos;s, three ofwhich succeeded in placing themselves on the tail of our fighters. In making itsattack, one of these German aircraft overshot its opponent, which immediately
French Air Force.43. Operations were more than once severely restricted by bad weather, bata number of reconnaissances of enemy territory have been carried out withoutthe discovery of anything of especial interest. An enemy fighter was brought down near Luneville and an enemy reconnaissance aircraft was brought down inflames near Zweibrucken, both as the result of combats with French fighter patrolson the 2nd April.AIR INTELLIGENCE.German Air Force.44. The only new development in the German bombing attacks on shippingduring the week was the raid on a Scandinavian convoy far North between the shetlands and the Norwegian coast on the 3rd April, in which Junkers 88s were engaged.Another Bomber Group (K.G. 4) is reported to have moved to North-west germany, and it is possible that this portends the use of additional aircraft inactivity over the North Sea.The activities of German reconnaissance aircraft have increased, particularlyoff the Norwegian coast and over the approaches to the Skagerrak. about twenty-four coastal reconnaissance aircraft were active in these areas on the28th March, and about sixteen on the 29th; and further patrols were flown onthe 30th.A table is attached, which summarises the German aircraft losses confirmedduring March 1940, and during the whole war up to the 31st March.Italy.45. From various sources of information, it is estimated the output of new aircraft from the Italian Aircraft Industry for the twelve months from spring1940, will be in the region of 300 per month.Other European Countries.Hungary.46. The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff of the Hungarian Air Force,Lieutenant-Colonel A. Szirmay, accompanied by Captain Udvary, a technicalofficer, recently visited England on the invitation of the British Government, inorder that they might see something of the Royal Air Force and British aircraft industry. During their stay, these Hungarian officers visited the Bristol Factory,as well as Balloon, Coastal, Fighter and Bomber Commands.[21094] . ^ cclosed in behind and shot it down in flames. During the afternoon, anotherformation of nine Messerschmitt 110&apos;s split up into smaller sections in face ofah attack by three Hurricanes, and one Messerschmitt was last seen gliding inan easterly direction with both engines giving out clouds of black smoke. two others, which were engaged by a single Hurricane, were also damaged and, whenlast seen, were behaving as if seriously crippled.On the 1st April there was another similar encounter between threeHurricanes and nine twin-engined Messerschmitts. It is thought that three ofthe Messerschmitts were shot down; one Hurricane was seriously damaged bycannon fire, but the pilot made a successful forced-landing on an aerodrome andwas himself unhurt.On the following day, six Hurricanes were attacked from behind by twoMesserschmitt 109s while engaged on pursuit of a Dornier 17 which was makingoff toward the German lines. In the ensuing fight, the two enemy fighters werebadly shot about, and one of them is believed to have crashed. One of theHurricanes also crashed, but the pilot escaped successfully by parachute.
