These proposals areup to a point similar to those which I had in mind, butthey are less drastic in that they do not involve any element of compulsion and less comprehensive in thatthey do not apply to services other than munitions production.I have now had an opportunity of discussing theMinister of Labour&apos;s scheme with him and the other ministers concerned with production^     We are agreed thatit will he necessary for the War Cabinet to take an early decision whether or not the wider and more drasticscheme is to he adopted,,      But it appears to me that thegreater part of the machinery contemplated in the Ministerof Labour&apos;s scheme would be required to implement the wider scheme8     Accordingly it would seem desirable totake immediate steps to set up this machinery0Particulars of the wider scheme are set out inAppendix I and Appendix II contains a memorandum by theMinister of Lahour describing his proposals, slightlymodified as a result of my discussion with him and theother Ministers concernedo(Intldo)     N.C.Privy Oouncil Office, S.W.1.-1-

The scheme outlined in this memorandum contemplates that,if and when the military situation is such as to require thatthe resources of the nation should he completely mobilised in defence of the State, powers would he obtained from Parliamentto enable the Executive to exercise f&quot;.ll control over persons and Property,,    The control over persons would be such as toenable the competent authority to require and direct theservices or labour of every individual over 16 years of ageDThe control over property would he such as to enable completecommand to be obtained of all means of production and means ofdefence,CONTROL OVER PERSONS the purpose for which control over persons is needed isto ensure that sufficient personnel is provided not only for the factories and workshops making munitions of all kinds, but also for any other work that is required in the national interest,,For this purpose there must be no distinction of rank,profession, grade or sexQ    It is therefore proposed that theMinister of Labour should be given power to direct &apos;::.y person inthe United Kingdom over the age of 13, to perform any^servicesrequiredo    In issuing directions as to the performance of such services the Minister would have power to prescribe the termsof remuneration and the conditions of service, which would include prescription of hours of labour.As regards remuneration, the basis would be &quot;the rate forthe job&quot;, and the Minister would have power to fix the rate forthe job.      This would be the statutory rate or the rat a which is paid under industrial agreements,  or in the absence of such agreements, the rate normally paid by good employers for work ofthe type which the person may he required to performn   Thus ifa professional man were required to perform professional duties hewould get the pay appropriate to those duties, but if he were required to perform work of a manual nature he would get the pay appropriate to work of the particular type he is directed to do.       Some consideration would no doubt have to be given to special cases where a transfer involved expenditure, e0g0 a transfer that necessitated living away from home.The Minister himself obviously could not give all hisdirections personally and he would therefore be given power to delegate his authority to special officers, who would be calledNational Service Officers.      These officers would partly he drawn from the existing staff of the Ministry of Labour and NationalService but additional staff would have to be appointed     Forthis purpose it would be necessary to recruit from outside the ranks of the Civil Service and it is thought that it would bepossible to enlist the services of a considerable number of officials of Trade Unions and possibly of professional organisa-tions as well.As part of this system, the Minister would have power torequire persons of any class or description who had attained theage of 15 to register such particulars about themselves as mightbe necessary, and the Minister would have power to enter andinspect premises and require employers to produce such books,accounts and records as might be necessary0Anyone who refused to comply with an order issued by theMinister would he liable to prosecution before magistratesappointed for the purpose by a Secretary of Stateo    It would heopen to the magistrates, in addition to, or instead of imposingany other punishment, to impose sanctions such as the requirement of service under special discipline,.MEMORANDUM BY THE LORD PRESIDENT ON ADDITIONAL POWERSo

CONTROL OVER PROPERTY.As regards general Government control of industry-there seem to be two principal types of. case -(a) cases in which the Government desire toestablish some form of control of a business;    and(b) cases in which the Government desire tosecure that businesses continue to becarried on throughout the emergency.,As regards the- first type of case there are no powers in existence at the present time preciselycorresponding to the powers exercised-during the last war to n-ame-..c retain munition factories &quot;controlledestablishments&quot;.      Under that arrangement the managementcontinued as befores but wagess profitss and many othermatters were the subject of Government controlc      Theexisting powers should be extended to enable control tobe assumed in this form without requisition of thebusiness.      In these cases9 it is suggested3 the ExcessProfits Tax would be raised to 10Q?o.As regards the second type of case which it isbelieved will be exceptional where a manufacturer orretailer is specifically ordered to carry on his businessthe question arises9 in the first place 9 what shouldbe the sanction supposing the owner of the business refusesto carry on?     The answer is presumably that as in thecase of any other individual who refuses to comply withthe requirements of a competent Authority he would berequired to perform service under special discipline and that the Government would put in its -own men to run the business and take any profits.Supposing the owner is not recalcitrant andcontinues to carry on the business *      If the business were a large ones any increased profits would be subject tothe excess profits Tax at whatever rate is decided toapply in the new conditions to ordinary business.     Tw?other types of case may arises namely -(l) the business may make smaller profitsthan befores but still a profit;(2) the business may make a loss.It is difficult to believe that the Government can do lessthan give a living wage to the man who is ordered tocontinue his business in those- conditions.      In otherwordss if he made losses or profits below those equivalentto a minimum salary for a manager, the Government wouldhave to make good the difference.

The closing down of small &quot;businesses which, ingiven circumstances, would no doubt take place - and whichwould have to be prevented only in. part - would assist in. providing a considerable labour force available for essential Government productionIt is understood that already full powers existto exercise any necessary compulsions in regard to farmers0COMPENSATIONoThe whole subject of compensation will requirere-examination and, it is suggested, overhauling,,&quot;Where property such as a motor car or a building is requisitioned the owner has a legal title to compensation which accrues due from the date on which the property was taken and which in practice .jan obtain fairly rapidly..If requisitioning is to be very widespread it would seem necessary to consider whether compensation should not be deferred until the end of the emergency,,      Should that be done, however, the question would arise whether the state is not under an obligation to provide for the subsistence ofthe owner, e0g\, a proprietor of taxi cabs, when his propertyhas been taken away from him and his own services have notbeen requisitioned,,BANKS.AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS0As regards Banks no difficulty in principle is seen in applying a system of control under which all major questions of policy are governed by the directions of a competent authority.The broad object would be to secure that those responsible for the management of the different banks would act in the closest co-operation with each other and withthe Central Government roughly on the lines of the railway executive Committee,,No great difficulties in practice are foreseen aslong as communications permit of control being exercisedthrough the London head offices,,      Should communicationwith London totally break down, the general machinery set upby the Government for all Government purposes exists in theform of regional Commissioners,,     These Commissioners ingeneral have not the staff or expert knowledge for thepresent purpose and the &quot;Treasury Officers&quot; attached to them have no acquaintance with these problemsn      On the otherhand, it should be possible to obtain banking advice frommanagers of important branches or local boards of directors.We should have to rely on sending the Commissioners advice and instructions whenever practicable.      It may be desirableto instruct the Commissioners in anticipation of the kindof emergency envisaged to arrange in advance for a localbanking expert or possibly a Committee of practical bankersto be ready to be attached to them.The Stock Exchange would have to be closed at the startand the&quot;re&apos;guYatiohs&quot; &quot;to&quot;be applied when it reopens need notbe settled now.      In any case, dealings would be frozen upin the contingency anticipated by the operation of minxmumprices.

In the case of other City financial institutions,e,g. discount houses, acceptance houses, the problemsmay be difficult but they can be solved in detail asthey arise6Building Societies will need separate consideration;their new business will dry up, but it w-11 probably benecessary to protect them against any undue withdrawalsof deposit    or share moneyccompetent AUTHORITIESlThe Competent Authority for the exercise of thepowers contemplated in this scheme would be, in eachcase,  the appropriate Minister who would have power to delegate his authority to local subordinates;,      Thecompetent authority for all questions of labour supply would,  as indicated above, be the Minister of LabourQIn the event of a complete breakdown of communications,the system of Regional Commissioners is available^      Itis assumed that they would continue to function as far &apos;as possible, exercising the powers contemplated in this s cheme .They have already on their staffs officersrepresenting many of the interested central Departments.If there are deficiencies in these respects, they shouldbe remedied.     But conditions may be such that themilitary will have to   take control.      The military havealready a right and obligation under the Common law to see that everything is done which the militarysituation demands.

2/8APPENDIX II.MEMORANDUM BY MINISTER OF LABOUR AND NATIONAL SERVICE.SUPPLY OF LABOUR.1-.      I have made it my first task to consider the nature of themeasures necessary for securing that our war effort shall not be hampered or delayed by reason of the failure to provide thelabour necessary for the production of essential munitions ofwar and that the required personnel shall, as circumstancesdemand, be available at the time and at the places where theywill be needed.     I have had the opportunity of examiningcertain proposals for acaievin;   this purpose which had beenunder discussion in the Department, but I am of opinion thatthese proposals, in view of the changed circumstances and ofthe urgency of the situation which now confronts us, are not sufficiently comprehensive either in their scope or themeasures suggested for dealing with the position.2.      The suggestions which    ore made to me were concerned primarily with the engineering industry, but it is my view thatthe whole problem of labour supply should be dealt with in onecomprehensive decision by the ..ar Cabinet and that it isnecessary to consider and decide the conditions that should belaid down to deal with the  problem in relation to the wholefield of industry.3.      In this connection,- the first proposal which I would desireto place before my colleagues is that the general problem oflabour supply and of the use to which labour is being put shouldbe a duty resting on one Department, and one Department alone.I consider that this is essential so as to enable the many different and frequently conflicting demands upon the supply oflabour to be related to each other, and to secure that production is kept in step over the whole field of national requirements. i recognise of course that it may not be practicable or desirableto apply the scheme I have in mind universally at the outset,but the powers to survey the whole labour requirements beginning with the most urgent should be established at once.      In the caseof mining, agriculture and the Mercantile Marine for each ofwhich there are separate Departments, authority should be givento the Department charged with  the supervision of labour supply to delegate its powers to the Ministries of Mining, Agriculture and shipping respectively.4.     As to the Department which should be charged with these duties, I understand that the general question of where theresponsibility for controlling the use of labour in the factoriesshould lie was discussed at a meeting held on 8th May which waspresided over by the then Minister of Supply and at which .representatives of the Admiralty, the Air Ministry, the Board ofTrade and the Ministry of Labour and National Service werepresent and that it was the view of the Production departments and the Board of Trade that &quot;full responsibility should be vested in the Minister of Labour and National Service, with authority over-riding that of the Production Departments and the Board ofTrade, where necessary, for taking the requisite steps to obtain,and use, the powers required t    control labour supply in such away as to ensure the most efficient distribution of labour andsufficiently rapid recruitment to the ranks of labour with a viewto the concentration of the -utmost effort on the conduct of theWar/.I concur in that view, provided that an adequateorganisation, as set out below, is set up and that adequate powers are vested in my Department.    Indeed I can see no alternative course that would meet the situation.      As between the conflictingdemands for labour of the various Departments concerned, theMinister charged with supplying the labour must know where hestands.     Moreover questions such as whether any particular firm

is using more skilled labour than is strictly necessary when there are legitimate demands for it elsewhere, or whether aparticular firm is askin. for- more of such labour than is strictly necessary,  can in present circumstances no longer beleft to the uncontrolled discretion of the firms.     These arequestions which transcend   -.11 departmental limits and any measures taken must aoply as much to Government Department   asto private concerns or concerns managed by private&apos; iiiteresos onbehalf of the Government.&apos;In order to discharge this responsibility, my Departmentmust be equipped with the requisite staff, including, inparticular,  technical and inspecting staff and with the necessaryexecutive authority, but inasmuch as the interests of a number of departments are vitally concerned in this matter it is essentialto set up a body representin.   these Departments and my own, whichcan settle general questions of policy and help in adjustingconflicting claims on productive  capacity05c      If it is to be my responsibility to sup-oly the labour required for the programmes of the various Departments,  I regard itas essential that I should know the extent of the demands for labour to be made upon me and also that there should not be imposed on mydepartment -oho impossible task of reconciling the conflictingdemands for labour of the various Departments and of theircontractors,,    The scheme which I have devised accordingly providesfor   the establishment by the war Cabinet of a production council, charged with the direction of the organisation ofproduction,,      In deciding the work to be put in hand, theProduction Council would give careful consideration to all the factors which limit production,  including the availability ofmaterials and labour,  and would ensure thau actual commitmentsare not entered into without full ahd proper consideration ofthe availability   of materials, lauour and every otherrequisite0      It would also determine questions of priority asbetween Departments and in so far as it discharges this duty itshould supersede the existing Labour Priority Sub-Committee whichhas in fact never met.      It v: mid also, no doubt, supersede the ministerial Priorities Committee but the relationship between theCouncil and other existing Priority Committees would :..eed to bedetermined with precision in o.- der to prevent overlapping.-,      I regard the formation of this Production Council as an essentialpre-requisite of my whole scheme.The Production Council, should, I suggest., be presided overby a member of the War Cabinet ad the Departments to which it isessential to accord representation include the Admiralty, theMinistry of Aircraft Production, the Ministry of Supply, theBoard of Trade and the Ministry of Labour and National Servicetogether with the Building Department to which I refer inparagraph 7 below.    Representatives of the Ministry of Agricultureand the Mines Department might be included.    As regards otherDepartments;  it would suffice if their representatives couldattend meetings of the Production Council whenever pointsaffecting-them come up for consideration.It would be the duty of this body to survey the productionrequired for the prosecution of the war, to ascertain the stateof production at any moment and to indicate where the position is such that stimulation is necessary.    Production in my opinion mustbe closely related to the strategy of the war and&apos; it would be theduty of the Production Council to translate such strategicalchanges in the conduct of the war as are indicated to it by theWar Cabinet into terms of the production of munitions which wouldin turn determine the extent of my duty to provide the personnelneeded to give effect to these changes.

6. I consider further that if a comprehensive scheme cf labour is to operate effectively, a decision should be taken by the WarCabinet bringing more establishments under direct Government control;in %P far as this is not convenient, e3 gc.,  in the case of smallsub-contractors, a price fixing system should be introduced of sucha nature as will effectively limit profits.I suggest that such a proposal is necessary and desirablenot only because it is an intrinsic part of the whole scheme butalso because it would be effective in removing from the minds of the workpeople any stiggestion that their additional energies are onlydirected to producing profits for others;    at the same time itwould be possible to determine the actual costs of production of individual items and so provide a check against exploitation andabuse.While the powers of control that should be taken should inmy opinion be general in their scope,  the extent to which it wouldbe possible to apply them at the outset would need consideration,,What I would suggest is that,  to begin with, we should apply them toall establishments engaged primarily or- munitions production and onall building and civil engineering work for the Government, either byway of direct contracts, or of sub-contracts where these areextensive.7.         In this connection,  I have also given careful considration tothe position of the Government1 s programme of building and works of construction.      Owing to the size of the building programmes of thevarious Government Departments and the absence of any effective system for relating building requirements to practical possibilitiesa position has been reached in which large numbers of undertakingshave been started with little or no hope of early completion.      Itis essential that a drastic remedy should be applied without delaytend I therefore recommend that immediate consideration should be givento the establishment of a new Department which should be charged with\ihe planning&quot; and-.....execution of-^l^LH^(works.for-the Government.     It would be the duty ofsucn^a^^epartment,in particular, to consult with the Production Council as to thepossibility of meeting requirements by utilising or increasing the capacity of existing factories rather than by building new factories.Pending the establishment of this new Department, steps should betaken at once to strengthen the powers of the Works and BuildingPriority Sub-Committee by requiring all Departments proposing toundertake any new building works (except those of small size) toobtain the sanction of that sub-Committee before contracts are placed.      In addition the sub-Committee should review existing programmes in order to concentrate effort on those most urgently required.8. The organisation which I would propose for the Ministry ofLabour and National Service itself for dealing with the problem oflabour supply is as follows:-I propose to appoint a Director of Labour Supply, with an   ,,intimate   and practical experience of management and with a wide   /knowledge of production and production methods.     In addition to theexisting organisation of the Department, I should also propose togive the Director the full-time assistance of three or four persons of practical experience drawn from the ranks of employers and tradjsunions.      These persons would meet together as a Labour Supply Board.The Board would be in permanent session and its duty would be to survey   the sum total of labour requirements in the war industries;It should have at its disposal complete information, to be supplied by the Production Council,  as to productive requirements and other fmatters referred to in parae 5 above, and in the light of this information and of the available supplies of labour would consider jthe measures necessary for obtaining the labour required, whetherby transfer, dilution, or otherwise;    it would also take steps to

ensure the elimination of waste of labour.    The Director of labour supply ehould keep in close touch with the Department of theMinistry of Labour and National Service concerned with the schedule of Reserved Occupations.9. While it is important to have efficient control organisation,the success of our plans will greatly depend on the extent to whichthe   detailed practical work can be devolved on local organisations and local people.      I regard it as essential that this should be done to the utmost practical extent and further that we should do all wecan to enlist local enthusiasm and emulation in support of our efforts.The local organisation which I should desire is two-fold: -(a) I should propose to use the existing Area Boards (suitablyreconstituted if necessary) as the channel for considering and adjust-ing any conflicting requirements of the Production Departments and theBoard of Trade in regard to the supply of labour in the area.    Itwould be necessary that my Divisional representative should take the chair at meetings of an Area Board for this purpose.(b) I contemplate setting up in each important centre a local labour Supply Committee.    The permanent members of this Committeewould consist of a Chairman and two other members selected from industry and appointed full-time on my staff.      A panel of industrialrepresentatives should be set up for each important industry in thedistrict and would he called into consultation by the Committee whenpoints primarily affecting that industry are under consideration.In a number of cases Advisory Committees have been set up by theMinistry of Supply for the engineering industry and should, as faras possible, be drawn upon for the provision of local panels of theengineering industry.It would be the business of the Committee to organise andfoster local self-help in every possible way for meeting problems oflabour supply.      They would, be assisted by the local staff of myDepartment,    Their duties would include consideration of questions relating to the admission of women to munition works,  the recruitmentef women and any dilution problems that may arise in their areas.They would be expected to stimulate all possible methods of trainingworkers in the erea for munition production and further I hope thatthey would, be closely associated with questions of welfare, lightingand ventilation of factories and workshops, arrangement of communalmeals in the works and other similar questions,  on all of which I amin communication with the Home Secretary.10,        In order to carry out the detailed investigations that will berequired in respect of the use of skilled labour by particular firms,the possibility of transfer of such labour from one firm to another,and the progress of training and. d-ilution,   I propose to appoint ineach area an adequate number (say 500 to 400 in all) of technical officers,  controlled by a Chief Inspector,      These Officers mustfunction over the whole field of munition production,  irrespective of the departmental interest in any firm.      In the appointment ofthese officers I should have regard to the possibility of utilising the services of technical and other officers already in the serviceof my own and other Government Departments.      Others should bedrawn from expert trade unionists and from management of a technicalcharacter.

llo There are a number of related suggestions which Iwould desire to place before my colleagues for the effectivecarrying out of the scheme:-(a) In order to obtain the full utilisation of labour andto prevent firms retaining labour when not required,,I propose that for purposes of employments firms in particular districts should whenever possible5be grouped and the workpeople deemed^ for purposesof transference;, to be employed by the group and not by the individual firm so that wherefor some reason workpeo-rle cannot be used in oneworks they can be transferred to another in close proximity with a view to the maintenance of maximum production.      In these matters it will be essentialthat employers and trade unions are brought intoclosest co-operationo      This process of groupingwill be materially assisted if all the majorestablishments are controlled.(b) With the same object in view9 I also propose that powers should be taken by Order to require employers in specified industries to notify immediately to the local Smployriisrit Exchange the names of anymen who are dischargeds &quot;stood off&quot; for lack of work or employed on organised short time.     The information shall require is whether these interruptions ofwork are due to lack of material lack of orders orother similar causes.      When such notifications are received it would be the duty of my area officer to make immediate enquiry into the causes of theinterruptions,, and to take steps to secure thatthe difficulties are overcome so that the men can continue in production or alternatively to see thatthey move to employment elsewhere.(c) In order to obtain the desired redistribution of skilled labour and to get skilled men to move from less essential to more essential work it will be necessaryto supplement the arrangements outline-&apos;1, in the schemedescribed above by introducing a Munitions VolunteerSchemes under which men in the occupations in scarcesupply would engage to transfer to such work asthey were asked to undertake.      The general outlinesof such a volunteer scheme have already been framed0Men who are transferred under the scheme will9however9 require to be given certain guaranteed terms as to wages and conditions of employment9  includinglodging allowances 9 if living away from home and paymentof daily travelling costs in appropriate cases andit will be necessary to arrive at the specific terms to be offered after consultation with the treasury and the representatives of employers and workersin the engineering Industry.(d) Training.,      I accept the view that there must be a boldand comprehensive scheme of training and I propose assoon as possible to refer the question of training and the best methods to take to achieve the desiredend to the Labour Supply Board for examination.I propose to extend the opportunities fortraining afforded in the Ministry of labour TrainingCentres9 which are at present confine;&apos;, to theunemployed,, to persons already in employments who might be prepared   to accept the terms which I am nowin a position to&apos; offer.     The use of technical schools and colleges should also be extended^ at least for*he higher graces 5 but there are other establishments

rsal cjwhich might profitably he used for training purposes-    Irefer to the many maintenance shops in industries otherthan the war industries which, though small in size5 can at least supply the preliminary or elementary knowledge ofa particular craft.    i believe that the men in these shopswould rally to the appeal of the State to assist asinstructors.    There are also works, which owing xo thefalling off of home commercial work, have space availablewhich might he used for training purposes;,      I propose thatthe duty of searching for available accommodation suitablefor this purpose should he entrusted to the Local labour supply Committees referred to in paragraph 9 above.These would,  of course? consult the appropriate panelor Area Advisory Committee,(e)    Fair Wages Clause,      A matter which causes me some anxietyis the necessity of creating in the minds of the workpeopleconfidence that the relaxation of customs which has beenor may be agreed for operation during the war -period shall cease to have effect on an appointed day following closelyon the cessation of hostilities and that the existing agreements shall he restored in their entirety.    It isalready provided under the agreement that any changes made shall he registered by the employer on a standardregistration form, copies of which&apos; are distributed to andretained by certain specified persons affected by thechange,,    If necessary we should take steps to secure thatthis is adequately carried out.    Furthers where relaxationsare affected through the agency of the local Labour SupplyCommittees full record should be kept by that Committee.I also propose that there should be added to the FairWages Resolution of the House of Commons a clause providing that after the cessation of hostilities any firms whichfail to restore the agreements would not be eligible forGovernment contracts.    In accordance with ordinary practice this would, also be applied to any contracts directlyassisted by any Government grants and i have no doubt itwould be adopted by municipalities, and public authoritiesin general.For the purpose of enabling this to be done I am taking steps to expedite the Report of the Committee which is atpresent examining the Fail1 Wages Clause, and. i should beglad to have approval of this further proposal,12c        As my colleagues are doubtless aware9  there has been agreat deal of pressure exercised for the further application ofthe Control of Employment Act, particularly on account of allegatacnsof &quot;poaching&quot; by employers.  Attention has been called to thismatter in the Report of the Select Committee on National Expenditure.At present the only practical application of the Act towhich effect has been given has been to issue an Order prohibiting(unless with the consent of the Minister) advertising for brick-layers , carpenters and joiners in the building industry.  Advertisingdees not, however, go to the root of the matter , and prohibitionof it can easily be evaded. The problem of advertising is9 in myopinions a symptom rather than the cause of the difficulty.  I donot therefore, propose,  as at present  advised to extend theapplication of this provision of the Act to   other industries.Moreover, the other provisions of the Act are too cumbrous for practical use.    Nevertheless,  some measure of control is necessary.I suggest that what we require is a condition that in specifiedindustries - in which I should certainly include engineering,shipbuilding, building and civil engineering - all engagementsof labour must be made through the Employment Exchanges or inappropriate    cases through the Trade Unions.    I see no other way of dealing effectively with this situation.13.       It will follow from the control of establishments to whichI refer in paragraph 6 above that agreements between employersand trade unions will be applicable over a wider field. This willremove to some extent the difficulty ef non-federated firms

not adhering to these agreements but it may he necessaryin order to prevent any action which might have a disturbing effecton industrial agreements to have recourse to legislation makingagreed conditions compulsory v;i chin particular industries, though am not in a position to propose such action at present.14.   The conclusions which I would ask my colleagues to endorseare accordingly as followsi-3   (i) that, subject to conclusion (ii) below, and subject tohis having authority to delegate his powers as necessary *to the Departments of Mining, Agriculture and shipping^ full responsibility for controlling in all industries, the supply of labour and the use to whichit is put (with authority, where necessary, over-ridingthat of the Production Departments, the Board of trade or other Government Department concerned)  should be vested in the Minister of Labour and National Servicewho should be equipped &quot;ith the necessary organisationand powers for this purpose, (paragraphs (3) and (4))..(ii) that a Production Council should be formed, preside over by a member of the   ar Cabinet, for the general direction of the organisation of production.    It should include in its membership representatives of theAdmiralty, the Ministry of Aircraft Production, theMinistry of Supply, the Board of Trade, the proposed new building Department referred to in conclusion (iv)- belowand the Ministry of Labour and National Service.     the mines Department and the Ministry of Agriculture might also be represented.    Other Departments should arrange to attend whenever maoters affecting them are underdiscussion (paragraph j).      It would be necessary todetermine with precision the relationship between theCouncil and exist in   Priority Committees in order toprevent overlapping.    The Council would, no doubt, inany case supersede the Ministerial Priorities Committee.(iii) that general powers should be taken to &quot;control&quot;industrial establishments, and as a first step these powers should be applied to all establishments engagedprimarily on munitions production and to all building and civil engineering work for the Government, whether byway of direct contracts or sub-contracts, where theseare extensive (paragraph 6).(iv) that immediate consideration should be given to theestablishment of a new Department to undertake the planning and execution of all building and civil engineering works for ilie Government.    In the meantimeall Departments proposing to undertake any new buildingworks (except those of small size) should obtain thesanction of the works and Building Priority Sub-Gommitteebefore contracts are placed (paragraph 7).     In additionthat Sub-Committee should review the existing programmes in order to concentrate effort on those most urgently required.(v) that a Director of Labour Supply should be appointed inthe Ministry of Labour and National Service together with three or four persons with practical experience drawn from the ranks of employers and trade unions.   these persons would meet to.geth.er as a Labour Supply Board whichwould work through the Area Bpards and Local Labour SupplyCommittees, in association with Panels or Area AdvisoryCommittees, set up in particular areas.     The Directorwould have a full staff of technical and inspectingofficers (paragraphs 8,9 and 10).-12-
