General Review.THE outstanding event of the week has been the invasion of Norway and denmark by the Germans, resulting in intense Naval and Air activity in northern waters.Northern Waters.2. As the operations consequent upon the German invasion of Norway and denmark are still in progress it is not at present practicable to present a completepicture.   A chronological summary of the principal events is given below.April 4.3. Air reconnaissance in unfavourable weather conditions early on the4th April disclosed the presence in the Jade of two capital ships. Aircraft whichwere sent to attack these ships observed two large ships at anchor in the roads andone alongside at &quot;Wilhelmshaven; five destroyers, many minesweepers and about60 merchant vessels were seen in Schillig Roads proceeding northwards. the attack achieved a possible hit on a destroyer.April 5.4. Further armed air reconnaissance on the 5th April achieved nothing onaccount of the weather.April 6. .......5.   On the 6th April a photographic reconnaissance identified the followingunits : &apos; .   ,Wilhelmshaven Roads :   Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at anchor in thesame position as on the 4th April.Bauhaven : One pocket battleship in dock.Hipperhaven : Two K class cruisers moored alongside.Scheerhaven : One 8-inch cruiser alongside Southern Quay.During the night of the 5th-6th April aircraft reported one large warshipin the Jade Estuary, and what may have been another large warship steamingnorth at 15-20 knots, some 20 miles north of Heligoland.April 7.6. On the morning of the 7th April air reconnaissance reported one cruiserof the Nurnberg class and six destroyers steaming north, 32 miles west of HornsReef. The bombers sent out to attack this force failed to make contact with it,but intercepted another naval force consisting of one battle cruiser, two Nurn-berg class cruisers, one pocket battleship or 8-inch cruiser, and about fourteendestroyers in a position 76 miles N.N.W. of Horns Reef, which they attackedunsuccessfully.In the afternoon, aircraft reported three destroyers moving southwardsinto the Bight and one grey-painted merchant ship stationary, 60 miles southof The Naze.A successful photographic reconnaissance of Kiel revealed the presenceof one 8-inch cruiser, the Leipzig, and one other 6-inch cruiser, the Graf Zeppelin,two tankers of &quot; Altmark &quot; type and three submarines.The Home Fleet, with the French cruiser Emile Bertin and three destroyers in company, sailed from Scapa Flow in the evening, and the armed merchant cruisers of the Northern patrol, except for two in the Western portion of theDenmark Strait, were withdrawn.Monday, Aprils.7. Between 0430-0530 H.M.S. Treviot Bank and minelaying destroyerslaid a mine-field in Vest Fjord, H.M.S. Renown acting in support.At 1400 a Sunderland flying boat on patrol sighted a German force of onebattle cruiser, two cruisers and two destroyers 220 miles south-west of Vest[21131] B
Fjord. The visibility was low and the aircraft was hit by A/A. fire and hadto retire.A German force of about 100 ships was reported passing through the GreatBelt at 1400, including one battle cruiser, two 8-inch cruisers, three 6-inch cruisers and destroyers.Between 2020 and 2145 Scapa Flow was bombed by twely^ enemy aircraft,attacking in five waves.   No casualties or serious damage yearn reported.Tuesday, April 9.8. In the morning Norway and Denmark were invaded. The Norwegianports of Narvik, Trondheim, Stavanger, Bergen, Egersund, Kristiansand andOslo were entered by German naval forces and transports, and occupied.At 0340 H.M.S. Renown sighted the battle cruiser Scharnhprst and:-Hipper(8-inch cruiser) off Vest Fjord, and engaged them at long range. The visibilitywas low in the snow squalls and the sea rough. The Scharnhorst was hit several times and eventually broke off the engagement and retired under cover of asmoke screen at high speed. The Renown had her wireless aerial shot away andone hit, which passed through her after part on the water-line without exploding.The destroyers in company were unable to keep up owing to the rough sea.H.M.S. Gloworm was in action with two German destroyers and an unknownship, and is presumed sunk with all hands.During the day air reconnaissance established the following dispositions of enemy forces :  ^Bergen : 1 &quot; I^&quot;gfeEgS?/gruiserSand four small craft.Borgan-Fjord ! S oruianra.Trondheim Fjord : 1 8-inch cruiser.Chriotianound : 1 &quot; Emden class &quot; crui3cr.Kristiansand:  1  &quot;K class&quot; cruiser, 2 destroyers and 8 possibletroopships.In the afternoon the Main Fleet was subjected to intermittent air attack and h.M.S. Rodney was hit by one 1,000-lb. bomb, which exploded on the armoured deckbut did not penetrate. No serious damage was sustained, three officers and sevenratings being wounded. H.M.S. Ghurka was hit by a bomb and sank. Five officersand ten men were killed, and the remainder of her crew were rescued byH.M.S. Aurora and Mashona.H.M. Ships Devonshire, Southampton and Glasgow suffered minor damage from near misses; the Glasgow had one killed and four wounded.Off Kristiansand H.M. Submarine Truant torpedoed a cruiser of the &quot; Koln &quot;class, which was screened by three destroyers, and claimed three hits. Truantwas depth charged for five hours and is returning with minor damage; The Oslobatteries are stated to have hit the Blucher (8-inch cruiser), which subsequentlyentered a Norwegian mine field and sank. The German wireless admits the lossof the Blucher and Karlsruhe.Two Gerjnan cruisers in Bergen were attacked by twenty-four RAF.bombers and mm hitfclaimed.Two attacks on U-boats were made by H.M.S. Zulu and H.M.S. Janus to the eastward of the Shetlands and Orkneys respectively. The attack by H.M.S. Zulumay have been successful.Wednesday, April 10.9. At dawn on the 10th April five destroyers of the 2nd Destroyer Flotillareconnoitred Vest Fjord, Narvik. They found five or six large German destroyers in the harbour. One German destroyer was sunk, and three damaged and set on fire. In addition six merchant ships, believed to be military transports, were sunk in the harbour, and an ammunition ship, the S.S. Rauenfels (8,460 tons) inthe Vest Fjord.H.M.S. Hunter was sunk and H.M.S. Hardy (Captain D&apos;s ship) was badly damaged and run ashore. H.M.S. Hostile (slightly damaged) and H.M.S. Havocwithdrew with H.M.S. Hotspur, badly damaged, in tow, and took her toSkjellfjord on the south sideof West Vaago Island.Later IT.M. Ships Icarus and Ivanhoe in the Vest Fjord sank the GermanS.S. Europa (3,767 tons), and captured the S.S. Alston (8,514 tons) with a cargo of coke and army stores.  The latter ship was taken to Skjellfiord.
The Faroes were also reconnoitred by air and no enemy forces seen there.A German landing at Aalesund at 2215 was reported by Norwegian wireless.German aircraft were active during the day, and at 2100 Scapa Flow was attacked by 20 aircraft in waves. The attack lasted 45 minutes and little damage was done. The returning outward bound convoy for Narvik was attacked twice,also H.M.S. Havant and H.M.S. Hesperus, all without result. It is believed thatat least 7 German aircraft were shot down by our fighters and A/A fire duringthe above attacks. -    - -U-Boats were active, and H.M.S. Manchester reports running over one whilstsubmerging off Bergen. H.M.S. Greyhound attacked a U-Boat in Vest Fjord.Three attacks were made by R.A.F. aircraft, one of which, off Duncansby Head,was promising.Thursday, April 11.10. Aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm from H.M.S. Furious flew to Trondheimand found only one destroyer there, on which, it is believed, one hit was obtainedwith a torpedo.ELM. Submarine Spearfish reported a German battle cruiser at 0030 off theSkaw steering south to the Kattegat.The German troopship Levante was sighted by a flying boat near the UtyoerLight, but a striking force sent out later in the day failed to locate her.General. &apos; I-    i      J -11. During the period under review HM. Submarines have been operatingoff the south-west and south coasts of Norway and in the Skagerrak and Kattegat.An estimate of the German shipping losses is included under German merchantshipping, -,&apos; - -The Norwegian destroyer Draug has arrived at Scapa Flow in good condition and no casualties to her crew. She had on board 67 of the crew of the Germantransport Maine (7,542 tons), which she captured in Haugesund on the 8th April.The Maine was, however, abandoned and scuttled on being attacked by german aircraft.The Governor of the Faroe Islands has agreed to afford us facilities, anda small force of Royal Marines is being sent there as soon as possible.   -      :British Minelaying.12. In addition to the mines laid in Norwegian waters, H.M.S. Narwhallaid 50 mines in the Heligoland Bight, and a deep minefield was laid offthe Galloper Shoal, in the Thames Estuary.Foreign Waters.13. The S.S. Queen Mary is, between Gape Town and Fremantle, where sheexpects to arrive on the 12th instant. The S.S.. Mauretania is between Honoluluand Sydney, and the S.S. Aquitania has arrived at Fremantle. ;.[21131] b 2H.M.S. Warspite and H.M.S. Furious, aircraft carrier, joined the home fleet. 6Fourteen Skuas of the Fleet Air Arm from Hatsjm attacked a Koln classcruiser in Bergen. Three direct hits were observed and, as a subsequentreconnaissance only revealed a large patch of oil, the cruiser is presumed sunk.Air reconnaissance established the presence of the following forces duringthe day :-Haagesund : 17 merchant vessels, 3 of which appeared to be German.Kristiansmnd : One large unidentified vessel was seen burning in the harbour; there were also 6 merchant vessels, one of them lying alongside.Trondheim: One 8-inch cruiser, one Nurnberg class cruiser, three destroyers and four merchant vessels.
German Intelligence.14. Enemy submarines are disposed across the North Sea in aboutLatitude 60 N; with patrols off the Orkneys and one or more in the vicinity ofthe Faroes.Protection of Seaborne Trade.15. In the week ended noon Wednesday, 10th April, the number of vesselsconvoyed in British convoys was : British .........      ...      711 &quot;1Allied...............        51   V Total ^ 990.Neutral .........       ...      228   IThere were no losses in convoy during the week.Six cruisers, 50 destroyers (including 7 French) and 17 sloops were employedon escort duties, and 2 battleships and 7 armed merchant cruisers as oceanescorts.During the week ending the 6th April, 39 tankers in British convoys brought349,743 tons of oil to Great Britain and 102,500 tons to French ports. Thisshowed a big increase on 293,243 tons imported the previous week.16. Since the commencement of hostilities the total number of shipsconvoyed has been : British .........      13,238 1Allied ......... 829   V Total - 16.741.Neutral ......    &quot;...        2,674 JOf this total 29 only have been sunk, or an average of one in 577. TheNeutral losses average one in 891.German Minelaying.17. A dangerous area has been declared just cutting the war channel offHartlepool, owing to suspected enemy minelaying.On the evening of the 4th April an enemy aircraft was observed droppingobjects in the Firth of Forth north of Fidra Island. As the depth in the vicinityis about 29 fathoms, it is considered doubtful whether the objects were mines!The searched channel in force is about a mile to the northward.Germany has broadcast that mines have been laid off all important harbourson the west coast of Norway as well as in the Skagerrak in the region betweenLindesnes in Norway, Lodbjerg in Denmark, Flakkeroy in Norway and Sand-neshage in Denmark., Another magnetic mine has been exploded in Liverpool Bay off Southport.A danger area has been declared and traffic diverted.British Minesweeping.18. LL trawlers continued operations in the Orfordness danger area and five mines were exploded, making a total of twelve in this locality. A mine wasexploded by an LL sweep near the Gross Sand Light Vessel, and two mines were also exploded by LL tugs about 8 miles south of the Cromer Knoll Light Vesselnear the magnetic mine area.The magnetic sweep exploded two mines during the week near the NewarpLight Vessel. The D.W.I., flying in formation, exploded a mine in the Tonguearea on the 8th April. This makes eleven magnetic mines exploded during theweek, and brings the total up to 102.Two German explosive sweep cutters have been recovered during the week.The fishing trawler Xylopia reported that on the 25th March she sank byrifle fire a new type of German mine floating on the surf ace in the War Channeleast of the Tay. These were two pear-shaped mines painted red and black, joinedtogether by a cable.
German Merchant Shipping.19. The Seattle 7,369 tons, which had safely reached Norwegian watersfrom Curacao, passed Haugesund southward bound on the 7th april the Ankara, 4,765 tons, which arrived at Dubrovnik from Trieste on the30th March and loaded 4,000 tons of bauxite ore. was delaved for several daysowing to difficulty in obtaining a pilot, and arrived at Trieste on the 9th AprilIn Vigo the tanker Brake (9,925 tons) appears to be making preparations to sail.At Santos, in Brazil the second hearing of the German appeal against the embargo on the Windhuk (16,662 tons) has been&quot;decided in Anglo-Mexican favour the final and decisive hearing will probably be on the 15th April, but, meanwhile the ship should be secure.Casualties to German Merchant Ships in Northern Waters since early on April 8.20. It is not possible to state precisely the number of German merchant ships which have been sunk or captured between early on the 8th April and the afternoon of the 11th April. Reference has already been made to the shipsreported to have been sunk during the operations against Narvik and in theVest Fiord.HM. Submarine Sun fish reported that she sank two merchant vesselsproceeding north in the Skagerrak. H.M. Submarine Triton attacked a convoy of 15 merchant ships on the 10th April and heard 4 hits. In neither case arethe names of the sunk ships given, so they may or may not be among the followingcasualties :  Sunk by British Action.Date.April 8881111Name.PosidoniaBio de JaneiroKretaAntares ....IoniaTonnage.

There have been no attacks made other than those which are recordedunder Home Waters during the period of this Resume.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.22. Four neutral ships, totalling 21,165 tons, have been sunk by mine ortorpedo during the week. No British ships have been lost. Details are given inAppendix I.Economic Warfare.23. During the week ending the 6th April 1,672 tons of goods destined for germany were seized by the Contraband Committee.The main items were 663 tons of feeding-stuffs, 481 tons of base metals,101 tons of chemicals, 123 tons of fats, 115 tons of gums and resins. The greatestproportion came from Dutch ships.Accidents.24. H.M.S. Impulsive was damaged by weather on the 8th April arid hasreturned to her base. The damage was not extensive and will be repaired in afew days. H.M.S. Kashmir and H.M.S. Kelvin were in collision on the 9th april and are out of action in Lerwick.
Germany.Troop Movements.; 27. Although there has been a marked lack of movement on the western front, the German ability to undertake operations at short notice remainsundiminished.A number of reports have been received from Eastern Germany indicating-concentration of troops in the south-east, viz., Galicia, in the Protectorate, andin Eastern Austria.No identifications have yet been received from Denmark or Norway, and reports of troop movements into Southern Poland from the west, and the north,and into Eastern Austria and perhaps Slovakia from the west, still lack confirmation -mation. The following table must, therefore, be regarded as an approximationonly, representing the situation attested by reports at present available.--	Cav.	Armd.	Lt.	Mot.	Inf.

One and perhaps two of these motoriseddivisions are believed to be in Denmark.Heavy tanks in the German A rmy.28. Although no tank weighing more than 20 tons appeared in the Polishcampaign or has yet been seen in the west, there have been many reports thatheavier tanks were in production. Reports from reliable sources now indicate the possibility that certain formations are being issued with 80-90 ton tanks.Northern Front.29. The German forces, which invaded Denmark, under the command ofGeneral Kaupisch of the German Air Force, are believed to have included amotorised infantry division and an armoured formation. No resistance appearsto have been offered by the Danish Army, and Copenhagen was occupied by5 a.m., the 9th April. Although further reports are lacking, there is no reasonto doubt that the whole of Denmark has been occupied by the German Army&apos;Western Front.25. The Illrd Corps took over the left B.E.F. Sector, inclusive of Bailleul,at midnight, the 8th-9th April.All leave from the B.E.F. has been stopped.&quot; The move of the 42nd Divisionoverseas continues according to plan.26. Enemy patrolling, attempted raids and minor attacks on a slightlyincreased scale have taken place between the Mosel and the Ohrenthai Salient.There have been two further instances of low-flying aeroplane attacks on french troops.
U.S.S.R.32. An unconfirmed report from a good source states that formations drawn from the White Russian Military District have been sent back from the FinnishFront to their peace stations, and that those drawn from Moscow are now on their way home. This would mean that the forces opposite Finland would be reduced tosome 24 to 27 divisions, but it is possible that the withdrawals have been greater,as two unidentified divisions are reported to have arrived recently in the PolishUkraine.Italy.33. The rumour of general mobilization can still be ascribed only to some political motive or alternatively to the local excitement caused by the call-upof a large annual class. Movements of troops to or from Italian overseas possesions have been unimportant in the past week, except for the despatch of3,000 troops to the Dodecanese Islands.Albania.34. The road construction programme had been delayed by a very severewinter and difficulties with local labour. These difficulties are apparently to. be overcome by the despatch from Italy of 22,500 labourers (probably unemployed)for work on roads, harbours and other public works. The military garrisonappears unchanged and still below war strength.Far East.35. In North China, the Chinese claim to have re-occupied Wuyuan,350 miles west of Peking, on the 1st April. This town had been retaken by theJapanese on the 26th March. It is probable that this last Japanese occupationwas only undertaken as a temporary measure to rescue any isolated troops andto demonstrate Japanese military strength. The most westerly Japanese outpostin Suiyuan is now 80 miles north-west of Paotou.30. Information about the German invasion of Norway is very scanty, butit is clear that the principal landings took place at Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen,Stavanger, Egersund, Kristiansand and at several points in the neighbourhoodof Oslo. The most reliable estimate of the forces employed indicates a strengthof two divisions (35,000). Less reliable reports mention one mixed brigade,including tanks and armoured cars at Oslo, a similar mixed brigade at Kristian-sand, and 3,000 men each at Narvik and at Trondheim.In the south, the Norwegian army is reported to be resisting a german advance in the neighbourhood of Hamar, about 60 miles north of Oslo.In the north, the German attack surprised the Norwegian garrison at Narvik,but at least one Norwegian battalion is reported to have broken out and to have established itself on the railway about 5 km. east of Narvik.In the extreme north, troops have been moved from Vadso to Bardu (about45 miles north-east of Narvik). This is probably the 6th Division, the head-quarters of which are normally at Harstad but were probably moved to theFinnish frontier during the Soviet-Finnish War. There are now reported tobe no troops at Harstad.Elsewhere in Norway the military situation is obscure. There is no reliable information of any military measures taken by Sweden on account of the german invasion of Norway, but the bulk of the Swedish Army was already mobilizedowing to the Soviet-Finnish War.There appears to have been only one minor military clash during theoccupation of Denmark by the Germans.Finland.31. The withdrawal of the Soviet and Finnish forces to their respectivesides of the new frontier was completed by the 8th April, except in the Petsamosector, which was due to be evacuated by the Russians on the 10th April. Thelatest reports state that the Russian troops were withdrawing from the Petsamodistrict on the 9th April and the Finnish General Staff profess to be satisfied withthe situation.
Royal Air Force Operations.Operations prior to German moves into Scandinavia.37. The presence of certain important units of the German fleet in theJade Estuary was reported by air reconnaissance on the 4th April, and a forceof six bombers was despatched to attack them. Results of the attack, which occurred in conditions of low visibility has been described in the naval paragraphsabove.38. Conditions on the 5th April were again very unfavourable. An offensivepatrol of nine Blenheims from Bomber Command into the Jade Estuary and a night reconnaissance by four aircraft were unable to fulfil their tasks owing tovery low clouds and bad visibility.39. On Saturday, the 6th April conditions of visibility were somewhatbetter and special reconnaissances were able to penetrate further, but did notsight anything of importance. Later the same day, however, a photographic reconnaissance aircraft succeeded in reconnoitring the naval base in theWilhelmshaven roads, and as a result the German naval forces mentioned inparagraph 5 were identified.40. During the night 5th/6th Bomber Command despatched a force of twenty-eight aircraft to make a reconnaissance of north-west Germany and topatrol the Bight. During this operation several aircraft reported intense activity on the Autobahn from Hamburg to Lubeck, with a stream of traffic with unmaskedheadlights converging on the latter port. There was also great activity atEchernforde near Kiel, where six wharves were seen brilliantly lit with arclamps.   Two large warships were also located.41. On the following morning, the 7th April, three Hudsons of coastal command were sent out to follow up these indications and sighted the naval force referred to in paragraph 6. Eighteen Blenheims were sent out to deliveran attack and, of these, eleven located the force and bombed it with forty-five250-lb. bombs. No direct hits were observed, but several bombs fell near the battle cruiser. A force of twenty-three Wellingtons swept the same area shortly afterwards, but failed to make contact with the enemy. The last section ofthree bombers of this force, flying some ten miles in rear of the others, was attacked by three Messerschmitt 110&apos;s, which shot down two of our aircraft;one enemy fighter was destroyed, and one seriously damaged.A photographic reconnaissance of Kiel was made about 5 p.m. and revealedother portions of the German fleet (described in paragraph 6).42. Conditions were poor on the morning of the 8th April, and it wasimpossible to use a force of forty-eight bombers, which stood by from dawn. TenBlenheims of Bomber Command patrolled the Bight during the day, but saw little of interest. During the afternoon, a Sunderland flying-boat located the enemynaval force referred to in paragraph 7, but was forced to return to its base withits petrol tanks seriously damaged by anti-aircraft fire. Another Sunderlandfailed to return from patrol off the west coast of Norway. Owing to the weather conditions, night patrol in the Bight was maintained by one aircraft only, which reported nothing of interest.Air operations connected with German invasion of Norway.43.   Eight Blenheims reconnoitred the Bight again during the morning oil the 9th April, but met poor visibility.  They reported numerous merchant vessels,one 15,000-ton hospital ship at Heligoland and a few enemy aircraft.  Conditions!were better further north, and reconnaissances during the day established the!disposition of enemy naval forces at Bergen, Trondheim and Kristiansand.44.   Twelve Hampdens were despatched during the morning to attack &quot; jenemy forces at Bergen,- but were recalled on account of weather conditions!Twelve Wellingtons and twelve Hampdens repeated the attempt. during &quot; Iafternoon, and at dusk attacked two cruisers and two destroyers ctff thtv Bwg4 .

A Dornier seaplane was shot down during the homewardflight. Four bombs were also dropped/prTtne &quot;cruiser at Kristiansand, of which two were near misses. One aircraft made a thorough reconnaissance of the faroes, and reported no enemy activity. A Sunderland sent to investigateactivity in the Oslo Fjord failed to return.45. On the 10th two Blenheims carried out a dawn reconnaissance over the approaches to the Skagerrak, and reported that the area was empty of shipping.During the day further patrols of the Norwegian coast were undertaken withthe following results:-Bergen. In the morning, tibor cruiser in harbour/ike^e opened fire with AA.guns aa-d. appeared to be undnmagod; machine-gun fire also opened from the hillsround the town. There were twelve seaplanes and about thirty merchant shipsmoored in the Fjord; no activity could be seen on the railway. Another report made in the afternoon stated that the cruiser previously reported in the harbourhad sunk.Stavanger. -A heavy concentration of enemy aircraft on the airport and inthe seaplane anchorage was reported at dawn. In the afternoon two Blenheimlong-range fighters were again over the aerodrome : some eighteen Messer-schmitt 110 and twenty Heinkel bombers were seen, as well as about eighteenseaplanes in the harbour. One of our aircraft flew low over the aerodrome and attacked two Heinkels and three seaplanes with machine-gun fire; one Heinkelwas destroyed by an explosion resulting from the attack and a petrol pump was set on fire. Two Junkers 88s. were attacked during the return flight, and were damaged : one of bur aircraft was damaged by AA. fire.Hangesund, Kristiansand, Trondheim and Faroes. Naval forces seen inthese anchorages have been described in paragraph 9.46. On the night the 10th/ 11th April a patrol was maintained over theBight and the Kattegat by six aircraft, which reported an effective black-out in denmark, with the exception of Copenhagen and large harbours on the easterncoast. The Swedish coast was still well lit. Early on the 11th, two Blenheimsfrom Bomber Command carried out a reconnaissance of Wilhelmshaven, duringwhich they engaged two armed Auxiliaries. The same morning twelve Hudsonsof the Coastal Command carried out armed reconnaissances of the North Sea and norwegian coasts, in the course of which two enemy destroyers were attacked50 miles south-east of the Lister Light. No direct hits were observed. A numberof merchant vessels were lying off christians and, and one was seen apparentlyon fire near the Lister. A submarine was sighted near Oberstadt, but immediatelycrash-dived. Two enemy flying-boats were engaged, one of which was destroyed.The navigator in one Hudson was killed. The enemy troopship Levante wassighted near the Utyser Light by a flying boat, but a striking force sent out later in the day failed to locate her.Coastal Command.47. In spite of heavy calls on the resources of the Command for special duties off Norway, its routine work was substantially maintained; thirty-eightroutine patrols and twTenty-three shipping patrols were flown, and sixty-sevenconvoy escorts were provided. Ten submarines were sighted, all in the northern part of the North Sea, and four of them were attacked as they dived : two attacks were also made on oil patches which appeared to indicate the presence of submarines.   Six mines were seen and marked.48. A very large number of aircraft were seen, especially off the norwegian coast, and there were various combats, in which at least five enemy aircraft were damaged. One of our Sunderlands was damaged while engaging two enemyseaplanes, but returned safely to its base.Fighter Command.49.   649 patrols, involving 1,498 aircraft sorties, were flown during the week.Nine enemy aircraft were destroyed and seven others probably damaged.   Therewas a certain amount of enemy activity off the British coast in the earlier part of[21131] &apos; c
the week, but no attacks were made and no enemy aircraft were intercepted untilthe 8th April. That evening a raid was made on Scapa Flow by a number of enemy aircraft, several of which were intercepted by our fighters. OneHeinkel 111 forced-landed on Wick aerodrome and another came down in the seathirty-six miles from the Scottish coast; three of its crew were rescued. Threefurther hostile aircraft may have been damaged.50. Nothing of special interest was reported on the following day, but onthe 10th April there were two attacks on the Narvik convoy off the Scottish coast,as well as on shipping in the neighbourhood of Fair Isle. Four enemy aircraft were intercepted, of which two (probably three) were destroyed. At dusk Scapawas again raided by about twenty enemy bombers, which came over in wavesand made dive-bombing and machine-gun attacks on ground targets. No damageappears to have been done; but there were a number of interceptions in which two enemy aircraft were brought down, and three others reported damaged. Anti-aircraft units claim to have destroyed three other bombers.British Air Forces in France.51. There has been less activity in the Advanced Striking Force sectorduring the week, and the only combats were on the 7th and 8th April. On theformer day, one Messerschmitt 109 was destroyed in an engagement between nineHurricanes and twenty Messerschmitts; on the 8th April a Junkers 88 was attacked at long range, but escaped. On the 11th seven Hurricanes met fourteenMesserschmitts 109&apos;s at 27,000 feet over Bauzonville but the enemy refused to engage.52. Fighters of the Air Component provided fifty-seven patrols during theweek, and had one combat with a Heinkel near Cap Cris-Nez, which was seen todisappear into clouds with smoke issuing from the port engine.French Air Force Operations.53. Two reconnaissance flights were made on the 4th April, a visualreconnaissance over the lines east of Wissemburg, and a photographic one west of Kaiserslautern; these disclosed considerable German activity on fortificationsand along the road from Homburg to Kaiserslautern. On the 7th April weather conditions improved greatly and 131 fighter aircraft sorties were flown. In thecourse of numerous combats, two German bombers, one Messerschmitt 110 and oneMesserschmitt 109, were shot down. The following day was also one of consider-able activity; 124 fighter sorties were flown without engaging the enemy.Air Intelligence.German Air Force.Operations.54. No first-hand information is yet available on the operations carried outby the German Air Force in the occupation of Denmark and Southern Norway.A total of about 200 aircraft of all classes, other than coastal, is estimated tohave taken part. In addition to the above, an appreciable number of trooptransport and supply aircraft, such as the Ju. 52, was also employed. The aero-dromes used included Schleswig, Neu Munster, Westerland, Lubeck, Oldenburg,Delmenhorst, Hamburg, Utersen and Kiel.55. Other activity has been largely subordinated to these main operations.Coastal reconnaissance units have been very active in the Skagerrak and Kattegat,and toward the end of the week also along the western coast of Norway. Severalattacks have been made on units of tlhe British Fleet at sea, and there were two raids of the usual type on Scapa Flow. The second of these, on the evening of the 10th April, was carried out in considerable force and included machine-gunattacks on the towns of Kirkwall and Stromness. Both these raids were unsuccessful, and involved the loss of at least six_ aircraft. There were alsotwo unsuccessful attacks on the 10th April on the Narvik convoy.
56. Reports from British and French sources in France indicate that, though there have been fewer engagements than previously, a good deal of reconnaissancewas maintained behind the Western Front; more attention than usual appearsto have been paid to Northern France and to the Channel ports.German Aircraft Types.57. The Heinkel 111 which landed on Wick aerodrome had a fourthmachine gun mounted in the underneath tunnel and facing forward. Thepossibility of an additional gun in this position has previously been reported.It appears to have a fairly wide arc of fire, but accurate details are not yet available. There is no reason to believe that this modification is being carriedout on all Heinkel lll&apos;s and may only be fitted to Heinkel lll&apos;s used primarily for attacks against shipping.58. Some interest has been aroused by the mention by Deutschlandsenderand the appearance in the Press of the &quot;New Messerschmitt Bomber.&quot; Theoriginal Messerschmitt 110 twin-engined fighter has always been regarded asa potential light bomber, while reports received during the past few months have indicated that some modified version of the Messerschmitt 110 was underdevelopment. The new aircraft appears to be the same size and general shapeas the Messerschmitt 110. A reliable estimate of the performance of this aircraftas a bomber without such details as petrol tankage, increase in power, &amp;c, being available, cannot be made. The aircraft retains its slim lines, however, and itis doubtful whether tankage could be increased much beyond our estimate of365 gallons for the fighter version. The range would be about the same orslightly more than the Messerschmitt 110 which just about eliminates the probability of it being used against Central England when operating from north-west Germany (without violating neutral countries). Its maximum speedwould hardly be affected, but if anything would drop to about 335/340 m.p.h.Its defensive armament would lack the customary lower gun and would consistof a free front gun and presumably twin rear guns as in the Messerschmitt 110fighter.Italy.59. The Chief of the Hungarian Air Force, Colonel Hary, and the Under-Secretary of State for Air, Lieutenant-Colonel Banfalvy, accompanied by theItalian Air Attache in Budapest, General Mattei, arrived in Rome on the28th March. The following day they were received at the Italian Air Ministry,where Colonel Hary gave a message to General Priccolo from the Hungarian air minister, General Bartha, and invested him with the Hungarian Order of Meriton behalf of the Regent, Admiral Horthy.The possibility of sending fifteen Bulgarian cadets from the Military school at Sofia to study aviation at the Cameri (Novara) Pilots&apos; School in Italy is nowbeing discussed. Fifteen others completed a three months&apos; course there free of charge last year.Operations continue against rebels in Italian East Africa by aircraft basedon Gondar and Bhar Dar. Over thirty thousand pounds of bombs were droppedduring the week ending the 16th March. One or two aircraft have been hit withrifle fire from the ground without material damage.New single-seater fighter aircraft are reaching Massawa by ship, and arebeing assembled there. They are intended to equip two new fighter squadrons,which will probably be stationed at Assab.A large runway is in course of construction at the aerodrome of Mellaha(Tripoli), which is continued beyond the existing aerodrome and is eventuallyintended to facilitate the take-off of heavily laden bombers. It is reported that allleave from Tripoli was cancelled with effect from the 23rd March.Spain.60.   The British Air Mail service to Lisbon was inaugurated on the8th April.  The Spanish Press announces the initialling of a special Conventionbetween the German and Spanish Governments for the establishment and[21131] c 2
exploitation of air lines.. No details are yet available. It is also announced thatan Air Convention was recently signed between Italy and Spam, regulating air communications and providing for collaboration in any future internationalserviees established.Far East.61. The Japanese have circumvented the French refusal to permit themto route commercial aircraft, on the Tokyo-Bangkok run, over Indo-Chma. Theline was inaugurated at the end of February by the flight of a civil version ofthe Type 96 Naval Heavy Bomber, which flew from Canton to Bangkok, keepingoutside French territorial waters, a non-stop flight of approximately sixteenhundred miles. As long as this route has to be followed no passengers willbe carried.
