THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1940.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (40) 157.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken tensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ITALIAN DESCENT UPON YUGOSLAVIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a draft &quot; line &quot; to which we might seekFrench and Turkish agreement in the event of an Italian descent upon yugoslavia and on the assumption that it is decided, on military grounds, to try and avoidbeing involved in war with Italy.This is an attempt to find an intermediate course between declaration of warand a completely negative attitude. I would deprecate involving ourselves in measures short of declaration of war such as tightening the blockade whichwould, whatever their ultimate effect, be likely to have the immediate result ofconsolidating Italian opinion behind Signer Mussolini.As I mentioned to the Cabinet the other day, we could take the additionalmeasure of breaking off diplomatic relations, but, in the circumstances, this wouldseem to me a rather futile gesture.No one is more aware than I of the unheroic character of the course proposed,or of how difficult such a state of continued uncertainty must be for the Staffs.In present circumstances, however, it seems necessary to play for time and thecourse I propose does not preclude stronger measures later.Draft.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government must immediatelydenounce the action now taken by the Italian Government in attacking Yugo-slavia a State with whom she concluded in 1937 a treaty providing that each party should undertake to respect their common frontiers, as also their maritimefrontiers, and not to have recourse to war as an instrument of national policy,and to regulate all their differences by pacific means. The Allied governments are at present engaged with all their resources in fighting the spirit of violencewhich is wrecking the world, and must reserve to themselves full liberty ofaction as to the best manner of dealing with this fresh act of violence committed by a Great Power against a neighbouring friendly and neutral State.11031   [21287]
