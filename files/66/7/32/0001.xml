(40) 339)May 10, 1940TO BE KEPT  UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME-(No. 36)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 12 noon May 2nd to12 noon May 9th,1940[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT23

General Review.NAVAL operations have again been mainly concerned with the support ofour forces in Norway. German submarines have been inactive and few have been sighted. Minelaying by German aircraft on the East Coast occurred at thebeginning of the period but ceased during the latter portion.The Allied Fleet in the Mediterranean has been reinforced.Northern Waters.Narvik.2. The naval forces in this area are occupied in providing supporting firefor the military operations, affording anti-aircraft protection, and transportingtroops.On the 3rd May H.M. Ships Resolution and Aurora carried out a successfulbombardment of the be is Fjord Area (Narvik town is at the N.W. corner of this small Fjord). An ammunition store was exploded, the road was cut and many casualties were inflicted on troops.3. Enemy air activity in the area has been increasing, air raids on Ffarstadwere reported on the 3rd May, and on the 4th May the Polish Destroyer Gromwas hit by a bomb from 15,000 feet. It is believed to have detonated a torpedosince the ship sank in 5 minutes.   One officer and 65 ratings are missing.On the 5th May, a bomb falling near H.M.S. Enterprise killed one marine and wounded the Commander.H.M.S. Ark Royal started to operate in the area on the 7th May and heraircraft had a marked effect for 24 hours, but after this the bombing of anchoragesrecommenced. During the week ships shot down 3 enemy aircraft, and one was shot down in air combat.  One of our aircraft was forced down.There are now three A.A. cruisers in the area and a number of land A.A.guns have arrived.4. Troop and store convoys continued to arrive, but congestion in theanchorages restricts the rate of unloading, and one convoy had to remain150 miles to seaward for over 24 hours until it could be received.Three troop transports which have the Polish brigade on board have beensent to Tromso.Mosjoen, Mo and Bodo.5. Landings have been successfully made at Mosjoen and Mo, and troops should have been landed at Bodo on the 8th May but the operation had to be postponed on account of fog.The first landing at Mosjoen was made on the night of the 2nd-3rd Maywhen H.M.S. Janus landed 128 men without opposition and apparentlyunobserved.   Reinforcements were landed about the 7tJh May.H.M. Ships reported enemy aircraft on coastal reconnaissance off Mosjoenon the afternoon of the 8th May.The landing at Mo took place on the 4th May, again apparently unobservedby the enemy.The forces at these three places have been placed under the general command of the Flag Officer, Narvik.Namsos.6. As reported in last week&apos;s Resume the evacuation of the forces fromNamsos was completed early on the morning of the 3rd May and by daylightall ships were clear of the land. The transports and escorts were shadowed allday and repeatedly attacked, it being estimated that over 50 aircraft were employed. Whilst no transports were damaged, the large French destroyer Bisonwas hit about 10 a.m. and shortly afterwards her fore magazine exploded and she had to be abandoned and sunk, the survivors being rescued by H.M.S. Afridi.The Afridi herself was hit by a heavy bomb about &quot;2 p.m. and sank an hourlater.   Two enemy aircraft were shot down.The troops safely reached Scapa on the 5th May and from there proceeded tothe Clyde.H.M.S. Glasgow brought back 23 tons of bullion from Norway.[21286] b
Iceland.7. A detachment of Royal Marines has been despatched to Iceland inH.M. Ships Berwick and Glasgow, in order to forestall a possible German attemptto seize the Island. A note on the situation in Iceland is included at the endof this section of the Resume.British Submarine Operations off Norway.8. Submarine patrols have been continuously maintained off the south-western Norwegian coasts, and with the advent of the dark nights have beenpushed well inside the Skagerrak.H.M.S. Narwhal reports that on the evening of the 1st May she attacked a convoy of 10 escorted merchant vessels off the Skaw. She fired six torpedoes andheard four explosions. In the subsequent counter-attack she recorded 75 depth charges, but sustained no damage except to her periscope. A report from Stockholm states the watchers on the Island of Ockero saw 4 or 5 transportssinking on the evening of the 1st May.On the 2nd May H.M.S. Trident attacked the German supply shipLanguenuen with torpedo and gunfire off Bergen, driving her ashore, a total loss.Trident escaped damage in the subsequent depth charge attack.9. On the 4th May H.M.S. Severn sank the Swedish s.s. Monark (1,786 tons)off the Lister Light. The ship was in charge of a German prize crew who were taken prisoners. The crew were sent ashore in a power boat after the Masterhad signed a statement that the ship was taken by the Germans at Stavanger andwas being forced to proceed to Germany.On the 5th May H.M.S. Seal reported that she was damaged and filling withwater and was making for the Swedish coast, she was then about 25 miles. by N. of Goteburg.  No further report has been received from her.On the 8th May H.M-S. Tahu reported an attack on two escorted transportsabout 70 miles south of the Lister Light; she believed that she obtained three hits.Home Waters.10. French destroyers have carried out sweeps off the Dutch and BelgianCoasts during the period, and special dispositions have been made in the SouthernNorth Sea on account of the threatened attack on Holland.On Sunday, the 5th May, air reconnaissance reported four medium-sizedships and twenty to thirty auxiliary vessels in Norderny Harbour, and one largecruiser outside the harbour. The cruiser was unsuccessfully attacked by air onthe 7th May, and on the following day she was no longer there.Danish fishing vessels were reported 150 miles East of the Yorkshire coaston the 7th May, and ships were sent to investigate.H.M.S. Wakefid escorting a homeward-bound convoy from Halifax was bombed in the English Channel in the early morning of the 3rd May, but neithershe nor the convoy suffered any damage.Accidents.11. On the 5th May the M/S trawler Loch Navek was sunk as the result ofa collision with an unknown ship off Hartlepool.  All the crew is safe.On the same day H.M.S. Faulknor struck a submerged object in RombaiksFjord.   Her Asdic apparatus is damaged and she will require docking.On the night of the 6th-7th May s.s. Balsac and s.s. Coxwold, both with storesfor Narvik, went ashore in the Minches. They have been refloated, but their storeshave to be transferred to other ships for passage.On the 8th May H.M.S. Isis struck a submerged rock in Ballanger Fjord.Both propellors are damaged and she has a slight leak aft. She has been takenin tow to Skjel Fjord.Foreign Waters.12. Further Naval reinforcements have reached the Mediterranean. an allied battle fleet arrived at Alexandria on the 3rd May.
A relaxation of the orders diverting ships from the Mediterranean has been authorised, and ships within four days&apos; steaming of Aden have been told to returnto that port, whence they will be re-routed through the Canal.H.M.S. Garland at Malta has been handed over to the Polish Navy. She isa destroyer of 1,335 tons, completed in 1936.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.13. Only two ships, both British, totalling 11,000 tons, have been sunkduring the period. Both were mined and neither ship was degaussed. details are given in Appendix I.   No other attacks on shipping have been reported.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. A total of 824 ships, of which 116 were Allied and 76 neutral, were convoyed during the week.   There were no losses in convoy due to enemy action.Since the start of the war 19,922 ships, including 15,764 British, 1,170Allied and 2,988 Neutral, have been convoyed, of which 31, or 1 in 642, havebeen sunk.A return of French convoys to the 30th April gives 3,457 ships escorted, ofwhich 7 have been lost.Imports in convoy to Great Britain during the week ending the 27th Apriltotalled 837,088 tons, compared with 877,650 tons during the previous week.Oil imported in 26 tankers amounted to 285,699 compared with 169,961 tons;48,300 tons were for France. Minerals showed a smaller total owing to the cessation of the ore trade from Narvik, the total being 143,339 tons, comparedwith 169,961 tons during the previous week. Cereals amounted to 89,725 tonsand other foods imported totalled 147,551 tons.15. Entrances and clearances in the month of April 1940 rose to 1,158,800tons, the highest since the war started. These figures compare favourably withthe entrances and clearances in April 1917, which amounted to only 568,800 tons.The losses in April 1940 amount to only a quarter per cent, as compared withApril 1917, which was 9^ per cent, of the tonnage.Anti-Submarine Operations.16. There have been three attacks by surface craft during the week. Themost, promising of these was by H.M.S. Valentine in the Firth of Forth on the7th May, when fuel oil continued to rise from the position for some time afterthe attack though there was no known wreck in the vicinity.German Minelaying.17. German aircraft were believed to be minelaying off the French coast,Lowestoft and Cromer on the night of the 2nd/3rd May, and off the S.E. coast of England on the night of the 3rd/4th May.Aircraft were also suspected of minelaying in the Fair Island Channel onthe night of the 4th/5th May, since which date no raids have occurred. Dueto these raids and those reported last week English East Coast and Frenchnorthern ports were closed during the early part of the week, but all are now clear.German minelaying is reported off the approaches to Bergen and Stavanger.British Minesweeping.18. One of the two mines carried by the German aircraft which crashed atClacton on the night of the lst/2nd May did not explode and was recovered andexamined. It was found to have a delay action gear, the delay possibly being of some days. All the present sweeping and precautionary measures should havebeen effective against this mine.19. Blyth was closed for six days owing to a magnetic mine which had dropped between the piers of the harbour entrance.  The mine was finally exploded[21266] b 2
by skids on the 7th May in deep soft mud in 32 feet of water 25 yards from thejetty. No damage was caused to piers, boats or glass ashore, nor to a coal mineimmediately below the spot.Fifteen other magnetic mines have been exploded during the period and nine moored mines have been destroyed.The known number of mines dealt with to date is 344 moored and 167magnetic mines.British Minelaying.20. Minelaying in enemy waters by aircraft and submarine has continue during the period. Further additions have been made to the British East Coastminefield.German Merchant Shipping.21. The Vogesen (4,240 tons), carrying a cargo of coal from Stettin for Oslo,is reported to have been mined and sunk to the west of Gothenburg on the6th May. German mercantile tonnage definitely accounted for as captured, sunk or scuttled now amounts to approximately&apos; 458,000 tons. In addition it isestimated that a further 30 unidentified ships of approximately 150,000 tons havebeen sunk by Allied Submarines, mines and aircraft. The total German loss ofMerchant tonnage must therefore be in the region of 600,000 gross tons, or about15 per cent, of their pre-war tonnage.The first signs of activity since the war began has been shown by german ships in Spanish ports or the Mediterranean. On the 4th May at Barcelonathe A tlas (2,297 tons) and the Bellona (1,297 tons) took cargoes on board andraised steam.On the 7th May the Maritza (2,910 tons) arrived at Sibenik, Yugoslavia, to load bauxite for Trieste. The Ingo (3,930 tons) sailed from Venice in ballast onthe 6th May for an unknown destination.The Rudolf Albrecht (3,817 tons) sailed from the Azores on the night of the8th April.  She has a speed of 8 knots and fuel for 8 days.German Intelligence.22. There is no reliable information of the German main units, but it isbelieved that they are all in or near German home ports. Smaller units are stilloperating in Norwegian waters. The Gunnery Training Ship Bremse seems tobe still in the Bergen area with probably a Torpedo Boat Flotilla and a Flotillaof small patrol vessels. The M.T.B. parent ship Tsingtao may still be atChristiansand South, and M.T.Bs. have been reported at a variety of places in norwegian waters close to German-occupied ports. A Flotilla of small patrol craft is probably operating in southern Norwegian waters. One of H.M.Submarines has reported that M.T.Bs. were operating continually during daylighthours between Lister and Egersund.  They usually operated in groups of three.23. There have been few reliable reports of enemy submarines in the period under review, but there have been indications that several, probably of the 500-tonstype, are returning to Germany. There is no evidence yet that the enemy has begun to base his submarines on Norwegian ports, but the reported presence atStavanger of the submarine depot ship Erwin Wassner indicates the likelihood of his doing so.Enemy submarines have been reported off the Norwegian Coast; one was inthe West Fjord on the 5th and three in the region of Trondhjem. It seems probable that attention has been paid by the enemy to finding our convoy routes between Norway and the North of Scotland, and that with this object four or five submarines were disposed to the West, the North-West, the North and theNorth-East of the Shetlands. There was certainly an enemy submarine in theneighbourhood of Cape Wrath during this period and she may have approached the mouth of Loch Eriboll. There have been reports from further south, butthey are not conclusive. No enemy submarine is thought to have been in theEnglish Channel, the Bristol Channel or the Atlantic during the period.
Considerable activity of patrols sometimes with merchant vessels in company was also observed off the West of the Frisian Islands especially on the 2nd and3rd Ma-.Economic Warfare.24.   During the week ending the 4th May. 9,740 tons of cargo have been dealt with by the Contraband Committee and seized in prize.The main items of these cargoes were : 2,393 tons of base metals,5,991 tons of food products and beverages, and379 tons of oil seeds.Total seizures to the 4th May, 1940, amount to 617,128 tons.Casualties to Royal Naval Personnel.25. The casualties in the Royal Navy due to enemy action for the monthof April are as follows :  Prisoners ofKilled. Wounded.         War.Officers    .........              70 20                  1Ratings.........             600 223                 37The total casualties from the start of the war to the 30th April are:  Prisoners ofKilled. Wounded.         War.Officers    ...      ......             260 56                 14Ratings.........          3,339 477                122The above figures are subject to adjustment owing to the uncertainty of thenumber of prisoners taken from ELM. Ships Glowworm and Hunter.Holland.26. In view of the present state of tension the Dutch Naval authoritieshave taken certain precautions. On the 7th May the Navy was brought to astate of complete readiness and mines laid to the north of Terschelling andVlieland. In addition to the previously declared areas the limits of this newmine area have not as yet been defined.For.some time past a Dutch cruiser and 3 gunboats have been kept on coastpatrol outside the Frisian Islands and Dutch submarines are also on patrol. Thereare now in Dutch home waters, one gunnery training cruiser, one flotilla leader(just arrived from the East), 12 minelayers, 6 mine-sweepers, 4 torpedo boats,2 submarines, 4 river gunboats and 2 coast defence ships. There are also inship builders hands one cruiser, due for trials next month, 2 destroyers nearlyready for trials and 4 submarines.Italy.27. There has been no change in the Italian naval situation except that four submarines left Taranto during the week for Tobruk, where they should bedue to-day. It is not certain whether they are reinforcements or reliefs, but itis probable that they are reinforcements, and it is possible that two may be finallydestined for the Red Sea. Cypher and P/L traffic have remained normalthroughout the week. Movements of merchant shipping are also normal andthe S.S. Roma passed Gibraltar on the 8th May outwards for America. Therehas been no sign of anything unusual during the past week at Brindisi, and the harbour has remained comparatively empty.U.S.S.R.28. The Soviet has put forward a demand for the Estonian Island ofOdensholm, which commands the Southern entrance to the Gulf of Finland.   It
is most likely that Estonia will agree to this. A further report that the Soviethas also demanded the islands of Naissaar, Aegra and Karl off the mouth ofTallinn Bay has been denied by the Estonians. The possibility of this cannotbe excluded, however, as the Russians are already in occupation of Naissaar, thelargest of these islands, and have established fortifications and A.A. batteriesthere.Iceland.29. Prior to the outbreak of hostilities there was evidence of extensiveinvestigations carried out by Germans, who penetrated even to the remoterdistricts of Iceland, in the guise of fishermen, entymologists, mink farmers andmeteorologists. There was also very considerable propaganda activity, and visitsof submarines, cruisers, &amp;c, to judge by the length of their stays, made possible a thorough survey of all fiords suitable for military disembarkations or shelteringsubmarines. There were perhaps 60 adult German men at that time in the island.Since September 1939 the addition of 65 men from the wrecked shipBahia Blanca and the presence of a more active German Consul at Reykjavik has considerably altered the situation. The new consul, Professor Gerlach, Wasformerly Professor of Pathology at Basle, but had lost his chair as a result of hispropaganda activities. In October last he was joined by a certain Adolf Smithsent over from Germany in a submarine. Reports from Iceland indicate thatan internal coup is feared.30. The Icelandic police amount to 100 men, of whom 70 are stationed inReykjavik. Normally they are scattered and unarmed, and their chief, Hansem,is suspected of close association with the Germans, although he enjoys theconfidence of the Prime Minister. The Naval forces of the Republic consist solelyof a fishery-protection vessel of little military value. The port facilities of the island are not confined to Reykjavik. Other towns with good harbours and reasonable facilities for shipping are Akureyri and Hafnarfjordur. The wholecoast, except a small stretch in the east, is permanently ice free.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.31. The 51st Division has now taken over command of the sector on the Saarfront previously held by the French 7th D.I.The 5th Division (less 15th Infantry Brigade) has been placed in War Officereserve, but remains in France.  It has been relieved by the 42nd Division.The 7th Battalion Royal Tanks have arrived in France.Germany.32. No important movements in the Dutch frontier, Eifel or Saar areas havebeen reported during the week, and it must be assumed that troop concentrationsremain substantially as before. There appears to have been considerable activitybehind the Rhine front (Karlsruhe-Baslej between the 18th-26th April, but thegeneral indications point to an influx of troops from the interior of Germanyand Austria and a corresponding movement northwards out of the area.There are probably still a number of divisions near the Baltic ports, i.e.,Memel, Konigsberg and Stettin, but there are no indications of additional troopshaving arrived during the week.33. Reports continue to be received of concentrations of German forces inSouth-East Europe. Owing to the large increase in the number of german divisions now formed it is to be expected that areas which previously had smallgarrisons now have additional troops quartered in them, thereby giving rise toreports of concentrations. These reports deal principally with South Poland,Slovakia and Austria. If action were intended against Hungary and Roumania,it would be in these three areas that troops would be assembled.The reports regarding Southern Poland state that an army varying in strength from seven to twelve divisions is in that area.   Though this may be an
exaggeration, it can be assumed that a number of divisions in Southern Polandcould be made immediately available for an advance against Hungary andBoumania. These divisions are not necessarily first class, but would probablybe at least as good as some of those used in Norway. The majority of reportsagree that Western Slovakia is comparatively free of German troops, and thereis no confirmation of the reports that there are German divisions in EasternSlovakia. On the other hand, reports which have not been confirmed, mentionsome recent increases in the number of troops east and south of Vienna. It isestimated that there may be a minimum of seven divisions in Austria.34. The distribution of identified German divisions on the 8th May was believed to be as follows : Area.	Cav.	Armd.	Lt.	Mot.	Inf.	Totals.Western Theatre Central Germany Scandinavia   ... Baltic Coast, including East Prussia and Corridor Poland, excluding Corridor ... Bohemia-Moravia Austria Slovakia Totals.........	1 i	6 1 1	3 1	5 1 1	Min.    94 Max. 109 Max.   22 Min.     8 Max.   11 Min.   10 9 21 5 5 1	Min. 109 Max. 124 Max.   23 Min.     9 Max.   12 Min.   11 9 22 6 I	2	8	4	7	168           189	The three S.S. and Police divisions are included among the motoriseddivisions in the west.Northern Front.Southern and Central Norway.35. All our forces were successfully evacuated from Namsos on the night of the 2nd/3rd May, and sailed for the United Kingdom with the exception ofa party of 100 French soldiers, which was moved, together with two Bofors A.A.guns, to Mosjoen.During the week the Germans have extended their occupation of southern norway. Reinforcements have been arriving at Oslo and the troops at Stavanger,Bergen and Trondheim have also been reinforced. Units of nine differentdivisions have been identified, but it is not thought that all these divisions are complete. The enemy forces at Trondheim have pushed northwards and were reported to have reached a point twenty miles south of Mosjoen on the evening of the 8th May. At the same time, the Germans are endeavouring to establishaerodromes north of Trondheim from which to attack the Allies at Narvik.Northern Norway.36. The 55th Light A.A. Regiment, 193rd A.A. Battery (3-7-inch) and2nd A.A. Defence HQ. arrived in the Narvik area on the 6th May. The PolishBrigade and Foreign Legion contingent reached the Tromso and Narvik a reason the 6th and the 7th May. The situation on the Ankenes peninsula remainssubstantially unchanged, with the South Wales Borderers in the areaBekkenhangen-Baatberget. An enemy attack on the 2nd May was beaten off withsome loss to the enemy. The 12th Battalion, Chasseurs, have now moved fromBogen to Ankenes. The 1st Battalion, Irish Guards, are near Bogenfjord; the1st Battalion, Scots Guards, less one company, have moved from Lavanger, north of Narvik, to the vicinity of Evenes-Lavanger, west of Narvik.On the east the French and Norwegians have made small advances. TheFrench, after landing at Foldvick on the 30th April, pushed steadily forwardagainst slight enemy resistance, until they reached the line Osevand-Labergdalenon the 8th May, and reported strong enemy resistance. The Norwegians on the left advanced from Lavanger and were reported to have forward troops nearGraesvand on the 8th May.
The German garrison at Narvik is reported to have been reinforced by air and supplies are believed to have been dropped.Middle East.37. Owing to the recent threat of action by Italy, one battalion has been moved from Jerusalem to Moascar, on the Suez Canal.A covering force of the Armoured Division has been moved into the western desert, though the bulk of this Division remains in the Cairo area.Italy.38. There are indications that some moves may be in progress. Formationsof the IXth Corps (24th, 47th and 49th Divisions), usually distributed along the adriatic coast, appear to be concentrating nearer Bari, possibly with a view tothe reinforcement of Albania. There is, however, no evidence that transportsare being collected in the Bari-Brindisi area. Some elements of the IHrd Corps,usually distributed in the area Domodossola, Brescia and Milan, are believed tohave moved eastwards from their normal area. The purpose of such a movemay be to reinforce the German or Yugoslav frontier. The situation on the yugoslav and other frontiers still appears to be normal.There have been no important troop moves in Italian overseas territoriesduring the past week.Spain.39. There appears to be a certain amount of military activity in spain and Spanish Morocco. Work is being pressed forward on the Pyrenees frontierdefences. There have been unconfirmed rumours of troops movements towardsthe Portuguese frontier. An increase in the number of troops of all arms in theAlgeciras area and the mounting of a few additional coast defence guns nearCadiz are also reported.Considerable reinforcement of the garrison of the Balearics has taken place and additional A.A. artillery and aeroplanes are being hurriedly sent to Majorca.Defensive measures have been taken near the French frontier of Morocco wherework on the construction of posts is being speeded up. There appears to be some concentration of troops in the direction of the frontier of the TangierInternational Zone.The above measures are considered to be of a defensive nature.Balkan States.40. Suspicion has been aroused in Bulgaria by a reported increase in theRoumanian garrison of the Southern Dobruja. In actual fact the Roumanianforces in the Dobruja are no greater than in the late autumn of 1939, whenthe Roumanian army had been augmented by the formation of some ten reserve divisions, and only one of these divisions is normally located within ten miles ofthe Bulgarian frontier.In Yugoslavia, the 1919 class of recruits is now being called up and by the12th May, when the call up is completed, the army will number some 430,000.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.41. Bomber attacks have continued in support of operations in Norway,and considerable damage was inflicted on enemy air bases.Attacks on Aerodromes.4-2. Stavanger A erodrome was again raided on the night of the 2nd-3rd Mayby five Whitleys; large explosions were caused in buildings on the edge of the aerodrome, and two buildings near the seaplane base were set on fire. There wasno opposition by enemy aircraft.
Owing to poor visibility only one Wellington out of nine despatched locatedand attacked the aerodrome on the night of the 7th-8th May. Light anti-aircraft fire was encountered, and one Messerschmitt 110 was seen, but did not attack.43. Rye Aerodrome was also attacked by six Blenheims during the day andby seven Wellingtons during the night of the 2nd-3rd May. Fires were started and two out of twenty-two aircraft observed on the aerodrome were seen to beon fire. The flash of a heavy explosion was observed by one of our aircraft whenit had proceeded 50 miles on its way home.   No enemy aircraft were encountered.44. Fornebu A erodrome was successfully raided by six Whitleys on the samenight without opposition; hits were obtained on the target and a fire was started.Security Patrols and Reconnaissances.45. Patrols over enemy seaplane bases were maintained by four Welling-tons during the night of the 2nd-3rd May, and by four Whitleys and fourWellingtons on the nights of the 4th-5th and 5th-6th May, respectively. FiveWellingtons were despatched to patrol enemy seaplane bases on the night ofthe 7th-8th May but were recalled owing to bad weather conditions.On the 3rd May a photographic reconnaissance was made over the frisian islands but was hampered by weather conditions.46. Long-range reconnaissances were successfully carried out by sixteenHampdens on the night of the 2nd-3rd May, and were continued on the, nights of Friday, the 3rd-4th May, and Saturday, the 4th-5th May, on both occasionsby five Hampdens. On the night of the 6tlh-7th May one of the twelve Hampdensordered on a similar operation was attacked by an enemy aircraft ten miles north of Wangeroog; after firing two bursts the enemy was hit by our reargunner, lost height rapidly, and disappeared in the haze.Coastal Command.47. The main effort of the Command was directed to the support of thewithdrawals from Norway and reconnaissances of the Norwegian coast. Routineoperations were also maintained : 211 patrols were flown and fifty-two convoyswere escorted, two submarines being sighted.48. During Thursday, the 2nd May, operations were concentrated on providing escort against air attack for the force evacuated from the areaSouth of Trondhjem. This escort was provided by Blenheims and Hudsonsand lasted throughout the hours of daylight; no enemy aircraft were encountered.49. On the morning of Friday, the 3rd May, a Hudson was forced by threeMe. 109s. to break off an attack on a merchant vessel of ten thousand tons justWest of Borkum. One Me. 109 was shot down, and the rear gunner of our aircraft was killed. Our aircraft was badly damaged and crashed on landing.On the same day, three Blenheims bombed and machine gunned a small vesselnear the Lister Light, without observed result.50. On Saturday, the 4th May, all available aircraft were employed on escort duty over the convoys returning from Namsos, a constant patrol being maintained from dawn to dusk. Early in the morning of Sunday, the 5th May,a Hudson reconnaissance sighted certain vessels in Norderney harbour, and one large cruiser at anchor outside the harbour as stated in the Naval Situation.On the same day, the flying-boats Cabot and Caribou, which had flown to Harstadwith a reconnaissance party, were heavily bombed and were beached in the harbour. Caribou was completely destroyed, and Cabot, after being re-floatedand towed to another anchorage, was bombed again and destroyed on the morning of Monday, the 6th May. Successful reconnaissances were flown on the night ofthe 4th-5th May by seven Swordfish, and on the nights of the 5th-6th and the6th-7th May by three Swordfish on each night.51.   On Monday, the 6th May, special reconnaissance flights were madealong the Norwegian coast between Hardanger Fjord and Sogne Fjord, and[21266] c
between Lister and Stayanger, but nothing of importance was seen. Other flightsWere made to Esbjerg and the Dutch coast. Two vessels resembling trawlers,which were sighted about 40 miles W.N.W. of Sylt and opened fire on our aircraft,were bombed without observed result.A photographic reconnaissance disclosed the presence of a cruiser of theNiirnberg class at anchor in a narrow channel between Norderney and Juist at noon on the 6th May, and a striking force of five Beauforts was despatched toattack early in the morning of Tuesday, the 7th May. One aircraft found the target and dropped one 2,000-pound bomb, without success. Other aircraft failedto locate the cruiser, but bombed some anti-aircraft ships, which had opened fire on them. One Beaufort was attacked and damaged by a Me. 109, and anotheris missing. Later in the day a Hudson was damaged by anti-aircraft fire while on reconnaissance in the same area; it is reported that the cruiser was no longerpresent. On Wednesday, the 8th May, reconnaissances of the Norwegian poastbetween the Sogne Fjord and Lister Light showed only twelye aircraft onStavanger aerodrome, and two seaplanes at the adjacent anchorage. Our aircraftniet with heavy anti-aircraft fire, but no enemy aircraft were encountered in theair. Reconnaissance in the Heligoland Bight area revealed nothing of importance.Fighter Command.52. One hundred and seventy-four patrols, involving 459 aircraft, were flown during the week, but there was little enemy activity, and only oneinterception took place. During the morning of the 9th May, a Dornier 17crossed the Scottish Coast near Wick and was intercepted on its return flight and shot down by Hurricane fighters.Fog prevented the despatch of fighters pn the nights pf the 3rd-4i.h andthe 5th-6th May, when enemy aircraft were engaged in minelaying, but anti-aircraft guns were in action on both sides of the Channel.British Air Forces in France.53. There was very little activity during the week. Thirty-one patrols,involving ninety-three aircraft sorties, were flown. On Friday, the 3rd May,six Me. 109&apos;s were observed by a fighter patrol at 22,000 feet, but they avoidedcombat. On Saturday, the 4th May, a Blenheim of the Air Component failed toreturn from a reconnaissance of North-Western Germany.French Air Force pperatipns.54. Numerous reconnaissances, visual and photographic, were carried out during the week over regions North and South of Strasbourg along the Rhine,behind the Seigfried Line in the St. Wendel-Kaiserslautern area and near theGerman-Swiss frontier On Friday, the 3rd May, low altitude . visualreconnaissances South of the Black Forest and in the regions of Istein, Kirchen,Kandern, Brombach reported great railway activity between Fribourg and Bale.Troops were observed under instruction in various barracks, but there was no sign of troop movement on the roads. Fighters were active during the latter partof the week; 231 sorties were flown, without combat.AIR INTELLIGENCE.German Air Operations.55. Norway. On Thursday, the 2nd May, and the following day, there wasa marked drop in the intensity of German air activity after the intensive raidscarried out on the 1st May. This was probably due in part to our attacks on aerodromes in Norway and Denmark, which precluded their use as re-fuellingpoints, and in part to the heavy wastage suffered by the units engaged. On Friday,the 3rd May, the Namsos convoy was attacked, mainly by dive bombers operating from Trondhjem, and, as reported in the Naval Situation, two Allied destroyers were sunk.
On the 5th May the centre of operations shifted to the Narvik area, andtheir activities have already been referred to in the Naval section. The enemy aircraft, which included a number of Heinkel 115 seaplanes, were evidentlyoperating from Trondhjem and Stavanger.The stream of transport and supply aircraft between Northern Germanyand Southern Norway has continued, and traffic of this kind between Oslo andTrondhjem has been markedly intensified during the last few days. Reportsthat the German garrison at Narvik has been extensively reinforced by troop-carrying aircraft must, however, be treated with reserve, though some suppliesmay have been dropped by parachute.56. Other Activity. German air activity outside the field of Norwegianoperations has been confined mainly to normal unit training and to occasionalmine-laying operations off our coasts.A gruppe (39 aircraft) of Heinkel 11 Ts has recently been formed with the primary function of mine-laying; the Heinkel that crashed at Clacton on the night of the 30th April/1st May belonged to this unit. During the night of the3rd/4th May aircraft from the same unit were again operating off the South-east coast, and another formation of twelve aircraft were active off the Dutch coast and the Western Frisian Islands.57. German Losses. A table of confirmed German aircraft losses from thebeginning of the war to the 30th April, 1940 (excluding losses in the Polishcampaign), is attached as an Appendix to this Report.58. Damage to Aerodromes in Norway and Denmark. The followingevidence of damage done by Royal Air Force raids has been received during thepast week :  Oslo Fornebu. Approximately ten aircraft destroyed and others damaged.Two hangars set on fire and the efficiency of the landing ground affected by bombcraters.Trondhjem Vaemes. Approximately ten aircraft destroyed and others damaged. One construction hangar destroyed and a repair shed wrecked. petrol and bomb stores were hit resulting in the loss of a considerable number ofcontainers of petrol and bombs. Casualties were inflicted on personnel. the considerable damage that was done to the aerodrome is being hastily repaired bymeans of forced civilian labour.Stavanger. The damage done to the aerodrome was such that at one timeinstructions were given that landing was only to be attempted in emergency.Thirty-five bombers have been rendered unserviceable and the destruction of the repair shed has increased the difficulty of effecting repairs. Recent reports indicate that, as a result of continuous work, the runways are now in use again,but that care is necessary owing to bomb craters nearby. Casualties were inflicted on personnel.Aalborg and Rye. Damage was done to the surface of the aerodromes and fires caused in the adjacent woodlands in which aircraft may have been concealed.There is reason to believe that at least two aircraft were destroyed in the firesstarted. Photographs obtained during the raid on Rye on the night of the2nd-3rd May confirmed reports of hits upon the aerodrome, the surface of whichis considerably pitted.Belgium and Holland.59. It is reported that measures were taken both in Belgium and Hollandto ensure that aerodromes should be rendered unserviceable in the event of aGerman invasion. All Belgian aerodromes were believed to be mined, and as aresult of the invasion of Norway similar precautions are thought also to havebeen taken on the principal Dutch aerodromes. In addition, Twente aerodromewas ploughed up, and there is reason to believe that the same policy was adoptedin respect of other aerodromes in Western Holland. At the time of going topress the Germans are invading Holland and Belgium, but it has not yet beenreported how effective these precautions have proved.[21266] c 2
Italy.60. An Inspectorate of the Fleet Air Arm has been created, to deal withtraining, organisation and co-operation of the Fleet Air Arm with the Air Force.The Inspector-General is General Francesco Marini.Considerable numbers of Italian Air Force reservists have been recalled tothe colours, and the increase in training activity continues, both in Italy and inthe Colonies. A new gliding school has been opened at which groups of pupils,students and young fascists have been invited to take a monthly course for aglider certificate free of. cost.A new airline has been opened between Milan, Venice and Budapest; thereis to be a daily service in each direction. Permission has been granted to the AlaLittoria to use Bushire and Jask aerodromes for the extension of their Rome-Bagdad service. Permission to use the aerodrome at Tehran has not been given,and the service will not be extended to Kabul.A parachute battalion of 280 native troops is located at Castel Benito, Libya.It is organised in sections of one officer or n.c.o. and eight men, and is carried in aircraft which have been modified by the fitting of a trap door in the bottom rearpart of the fuselage. The equipment of each man consists of a machine gunwith 250 rounds of ammunition, food for three days, gas mask and first-aid case.The equipment is thrown out separately attached to a special parachute.Spain.61. It is reported that General Fernandez Barron, the Spanish Under -Secretary for Air, left Rome on the 1st May by air for Berlin with members ofhis staff. It is believed that this visit to Berlin relates to the re-equipment of theSpanish Air Force. All aircraft at present in service are at least two years old,and have undergone war service. Neither Italy nor Germany has been able tosupply spares in adequate quantities, and many aircraft are useless for thisreason. The Spanish aircraft industry is not itself capable of maintaining theserviceability of the Air Force, and the question of re-equipment is therefore amatter of urgency if the war potential of the Air Force is to be maintained.In spite of the official assurance given by the Director-General of CivilAviation, it is reported that German crews are still employed on the civil air route between Barcelona and Palma (Majorca).The number of aircraft engaged on regular services to Spain from countriesadjacent to Germany is estimated at about 48 weekly; excluding the weight andspace taken up by the transport of passengers, this would permit about 45 tonsof freight a week to be carried.Roumania.62. Our Ai.r Attache in Bucharest reports that he flew recently fromBucharest to Brasov. The route passes directly over the oil districts, and althoughone or two of the petrol tank farms have been camouflaged, it is possible fromthe air to distinguish the exact location of each refinery with great clearness.The aerodrome at Brasov was visited and the aircraft of the First BomberFlotilla were seen there. The standard of efficiency appeared to be low andthe Flotilla is certainly not on a war footing. Most of the aircraft, whichwere of at least six different types, had not sufficient spares to last for morethan a few days of war. Thirty-seven Blenheims which were received last october are still lying in their hangars, as the Air Ministry have not yet decidedfor what purpose to use them.  Three of them have been used for training.
