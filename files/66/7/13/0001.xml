ANNEX I.Jj. (kO)BO&apos;9TH APRIL 19u1^7/OPERATIONS  IN NOR&apos;.; AY *Note by the Chairman, Kilitary Co-ordination Committee.the very easy landings we have had from Aandalesnes andother ports in this southern fiord, the indiscretions ofthe Press pointing to a storm of Trondheim, and thevery heavy Naval forces required for this operationcalled &quot;Hammer&quot;, with the undoubted major risks connectedwith keeping so many valuable ships so many hoursunder close air attack, have led the Chiefs of Staff andtheir Deputies to advise that there should be a completealteration of the emphasis between the two pincer attacks and the Centre attack; in the following sense:    that themain weight should be thrown into the Northern and southern pincers, and that the central attack on T. shouldbe reduced to a demonstration.2. Owing to the rapidity with which events andopinions have moved, it became necessary to take adecision of which the Prime Minister has approved, as setout in paragraph 1, and orders are being issued accordingly.3* It is proposed to encourage the idea of a central attack upon T., and to emphasise this by abombardment by battleships of the outer forts at thesuitable moment.1.The considerable advance made by Carton de Wiart,

h. Every effort will be made to strengthen Cartonde Wiart with artillery, without ?/hich his force isnot well-composed,5. All the troops we have now under orders for&quot;Hammer&quot; will be shoved in as quickly as possible,mostly in warships, at the various ports of the RomsdaleFiord to press on to Dombaas, and then, some delayingforce being sent southward to the Norwegian main front,the bulk will   turn north towards Trondhjem.    There isalready one brigade (Morgan&apos;s) ashore beyond Aandalesneswith the 600 Marines.    The brigade from France and thesupporting Territorial brigade, will all be thrownin here as quickly as possible.    This should enableDombaas to be secured, and the control to be extended tothe more easterly of the two Norwegian railways running fromOslo to Trondhjem, Storen being a particularly advantageouspointo      The destination of the Second Demi-Brigade ofChasseurs Alpins, the two battalions of the-french foreign Legion, and the thousand Canadians, can for todayor tomorrow be left open.6. The position of the Namsos Force must beregarded as somewhat hazardous, but its Commander is used to taking risks.    On the other hand,  it is not seenwhy we cannot bring decisive superiority to bear along the Aandalesnes-Dombaas railway, and operate as occasionserves beyond that most important point,  the object beingthe isolation of Trondhjem and its capture.7. Although this change of emphasis is to bedeprecated on account of its being a change, it must berecognised that we move from a more hazardous to a lesshazardous opox^tion, and greatly reduce the strain uponthe Navy involved in &quot;Hammer&quot;.    It would seem that our

results would be equally achieved by the safer plan,and it does not follow that they will be delayed.    We cancertainly get more men sooner on to Norwegian soil bythis method than the other.8. It is not possible to deprive Narvik of itsbattleships at the moment we have urged strenuous action.WARSPITE has therefore been ordered to return.    some further reinforcement will be required for Narvik, whichmust be studied at once.    The Canadians should beconsidered.9. At the same time, the sweep of the Skagerrakwill now become possible to clear away the enemyanti-submarine craft and aid our submarines.10. In harmony with the above, the Planning Staffsare working this afternoon upon the precise arrangements.The First Sea Lord is explaining the situation toC.-in-C, Home Fleet, as I shall do tomorrow when I visithim at Scapa.    The Military Co-ordination Committee willmeet this evening at 10 p.m. to consider the technicalproposals either at 10 Downing Street or the Admiraltyas the Prime Minister may desire.(Signed)    WINSTON S.  CHURCHILL.

ANNEX II.1940.      ^WAR CABINET.MILITARY CO-ORDINATION COMMITTEE.OPERATION &quot;HAMMER&quot;.Aide Memoire prepared for the Chiefs of Staff.In view of the success of the landings at Namsosand Andalsnes the Chiefs of Staff have thought it rightto re-consider the plan for Operation &quot;Hammer&quot; as amatter of urgency.2. In the first place, the Chiefs of Staff have alwaysrealised that Operation &quot;Hammer&quot;, as originally conceived,  -was open to very considerable risks.     A combined operationInvolving an opposed landing has at all times proved to be one of the most, difficult and hazardous operations of war,for which the most detailed and. careful preparation isnecessary.5.        They have appreciated that the plan had thefollowing disadvantages:-(a) The concentration of almost the whole of theHome Fleet in an area where it could be subjected to heavy air attack.(b) In the absence of previous reconnaissance andof air photographs, the plan has been worked out from maps and charts.(c) Owing to the urgency of carrying out theoperations at the earliest possible date,insufficient time has been available forthat detailed and meticulous preparationwhich is so necessary in operations ofthis character and magnitude.

The new factors in the situation are -(a) -The   seizure of the landing places atNsmsos and Andalsnes without loss and ttr?--t?b&quot;tat)lishinent of our forcesashore at these places.(b) Reports from a reliable source that theGermans are working hard at improving the defences of the oort and approachesat Trondheim.(c) Press reports have already appearedof our intentions to carry out a directlanding at Trondheim.5.     Weighing up the above considerations the Chiefs ofStaff are unanimous that we should take advantage of ourunexpected success in landing forces North and South ofTrondheim to turn a venture, which was attended by gravehazards, into an operation which   can achieve the same result with much less risk.6.      It is essential that we should seize Trondheim and use it as a base for subsequent operations in Scandinavia, andif we were to do so by a spectacular direct assault in the- ,..near few days,  the oalitical   ^actions would no doubt be most favourable.     Nevertheless the chiefs of Staff feel thatif the operation failed or was even only -oartialljT- success-ful, the effect on subsequent operations and on Norwegianresistance, as well as the political repercussions, wouldbe very grave.7*     Moreover, by a change of olan, the press reports ofour intentions can be turned to our advantage, and byjudicious &quot;lea-cage&quot; in various directions, it should bepossible to reinforce the impression that our original planstill holds*.8.     The revised plan, in brief, is as follows(a) Push in the maximum forces possible namsos and more particularly at Andalsnes.(b) Get control of the road and rail communica-tions running ns quickly as possiblethrough Dombaas.(c) Tho force from Namsos to invest Trondheimfrom the North and the force from Andalsnesto advance on the port from the South. -(d) A bombardment.of the outer forts by H.M.ships, with a view to deluding the enemyinto thinkinK a direct assault is about tot^ceQpi^o just beforeihe main landings at (a)

Richmond Terrace, s.W.lo3-9.        The Chief of Staff consider that by dispersingour forces, and by making use of as many landing places as possible,, the risk of air attack, which may be heavyat Andalsnes, can be accepted.     They are examining thepossibility o.:1 establishing fighters ashore near Andalsnes,X6o       By the plan now proposed we shall investTrbndhjem by land and blockade it by sea and althoughits capture will take longer than originally contemplated,it may be possible to put our main forces ashore at a slightly earlier date011.      PJjfcBOXy the Chiefs of Staff point out that theenveloping operation, as opposed to direct assault, willrelease a considerable number of valuable units of theFleet for operations in other areas e,g, at Narvik.12.       They recommend that the outline plan referred toin paragraph 8 above should be adopted In preference to our original plan for a direct assault, and that thenecessary--det-ails^sho-uXd be worked-out wjjsh the, utmostdespatch.

ANNEX    IIISECRET.PRELIMINARY NOTES FOR AN APPRECIATION OFTHE SITUATION IN CENTRAL SCANDINAVIA.Memorandum bythe Chief of the Imperial General Staff.1.   Object.Our object remains to capture Trondheim and establishcontrol of that part of Norway which will give security to therailway running east from Trondheim into Sweden.2.   Enemy Strength.The chief enemy forces which affect our problem ares(a) Those in Trondheim area, say 3,000 to 5,000 liableto be reinforced by air up to a total of say 8,000.(b) Those which have landed in Oslo area.    These canbe reinforced by sea and air.    Within a week or two theymight amount to two or three divisions including possiblyone light division.    We may anticipate that some part ofthem would advance up the railway towards Lillehammer,while some other part, after clearing up the Norwegiandivision which has been north-east of Oslo, might advancealong the light railway through Elverum.    Other detachmentsmight advance by such passable roads as could be found witha view to outflanking Allied forces which might be oppos-ing the direct German advance along the railways.(c) It seems unlikely that the Germans could make any effective advance from the south-west, i.e. from Bergen orStavanger, owing to lack of :?r.-\ds and railways.(a) Air. The scale of air attack which theGermans will develop may increase beyond what we are nowexperiencing if they are able to develop ground aerodromes.On the other hand, the use they are now making of frozenlakes as aerodromes must cease with the thaw.V   Own Strength.(a)   Based on Namsos.146 Inf. Bde.  (transport en route).Demi bde. Chasseurs Alpins will commence landing

tonight*-  - -Their--transport is with them.      They have 12 25-mm.A.A. guns.There are strong reasons for following the 1st Echelon ofthe French force with a second echelon, so that the whole canoperate together.      The second echelon includes mountain artillery and light tanks, and could commence landing about the 25th.They are not so organised that the two demi Brigades can heeasily separated.(b) Based on MOLDE and AANDALSNES.Ahout 1,000 men of 148 Info Bde0 have landed, and are to&quot;be followed shortly &quot;by the remainder.      Transport is en routewith four light A.A. guns, &quot;bringing their total to eight.(c) Reinforcements available:15 Inf. Bde.147 Inf. Bde.   (transport and one battery 25-pdrs. readyto sail.) also four light A.A. guns.Base personnel - 1 heavy A.A, battery, one 25-pdr.battery, one A.T. battery.1,000 Canadians, in no way organised for sustainedoperations in Scandinavia.A further French contingent - 2 bns. Foreign Legion, and four bns. Poles might reach Scandinavia the first week in May.Another heavy A.A. battery should be available about the21st May.(&amp;)   Norwegians.Owing to very serious shortages of equipment, smallreliance can be placed on any Norwegian forces at present.Should we be able adequately to cover their re-organisation andre-equipment, some material value might be&apos; got from them after a month or two.     Rifles to be supplied at once,(e)   Air.Nil.     it is essential to develop our own air resources.4&apos;     Some limiting factors.(a)   Snow.      In the NAMSOS - TRONDHEIM area, snow and thaw willhamper movement for another weeks.In the AANDALSNES - LILLEHAMMER - TRONDHEIM area, snowmay disappear a little sooner.

(b) Mountainse     The mountainous character of much of thecountry restricts movement on any considerable scale to well-defined lines of advance,     Demolition of communications is fairly easy.From the above factors it is clear that advance and attack are hampered and defence facilitated by the conditions,and that control of railways is extremely important.      x(c) Base facilities.     Facilities for the development ofa base either at Namsos or in the Molde -Aandalsnes area aremeagre in the extremes and will certainly set a limit on theforces which can be maintained.,Closely linked with this factor is the vulnerabilityof shipping when approaching these bases in the face of hostileair frrcesoIt follows that the hasty despatch of troops through these bases entails risks of administrative breakdown.Moreover9 should shipping losses from air attack prove undulyheavys the abandonment of the operation on this account mighthave to be seriously considered.5.    Enemy courses of action.enemy,Y forces in Trondheim area have pushed east to theSwedish frontier and southwards down the railway.      It seems likely that5 while fortifying their position at Trondheim itself and against advance from Namsoss the Germans would be well-advised to operate such forces as they can spare southwardsfrom Trondheim in an endeavour to open up through communications to their forces advancing north from Oslo area.Similarly, the forces assembling in the Oslo area mustalmost certainly have as their main role an advance to effect a junction with Trondheim forces.. This they are likely toattempt not only along the main railway to Dombaas9 but alsothe light railway further east. The road running alongsidethis railway is the only one likely to be clear of snow inthe immediate future. __^__x Whether in snow or in mountains5 the force whichis equipped and trained to give it tactical mobility willpossess a great advantage over one which is not so trained..-3-

Ill6.    Own coursesoIf we are to capture Trondheim by a pincer movement from the north and south9 it is essential that each halfof the pincers should operate in security3      It is clearthat the southern pincer would be threatened by any powerfulGerman advance in &apos;the direction of 0slo0     To secure ourselvesagainst such an enemy advance is therefore an essentialmeasure for the realisations of plans *To hold the enemy on their line of advance toLillehammer is the first essentialo      This will certainly need a brigade as soon as we can get one forward,,     A3 the Germansdevelop their advance, we may well need a division,,      It isequally important to arrest a German advance along the lightrailway^,     This will need a detachment3 which must if possibleoperate to the southward of the lateral road from Venebygdento Atncsen k1      It is therefore clear that for some weeks9 itwould be out of the question to provide any appreciable force to advance on Trondheim from the southo      It is probably truethat our pincer movement could not be developed within amonthoThe capture of Trondheim could therefore only be effective before this date by an advance from NamsoSoIn principals those of our forces which posses theleast tactical mobility should be employed on the defensiverole in the south, and those possessing the greatest tacticalmobility on the offensive role from the north.      Thisconstitutes a strong argument for employing the whole of the chasseurs Alpins under Carton de Wiart.The possibility of effecting a feint by naval forces against Trondheim is of iraportance.      It is at presentimpossible to say at what date it might be of the gratest value.     The date must depend on Carton de Wiart&apos;s progress.,
