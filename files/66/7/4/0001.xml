THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   April 1940.SECRET. Copy No.   2W.P. (40) 124.April 6, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.MEETINGS OF THE SUPREME WAR COUNCIL AND THEFORMATION OF AN ALLIED SECRETARIAT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AT the sixth meeting of the Supreme War Council on the 28th March, itwas agreed in principle that the Supreme War Council should hold more frequentand more regular meetings. It was further agreed that the question of theformation of a permanent Allied secretariat to the Supreme War Council shouldbe examined.In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet of the 29th MarchI now circulate to my colleagues a memorandum on this subject.H.Foreign jOffice, April 6, 1940.THE proposal to hold regular and more frequent meetings of the supreme war Council has much to commend it.(1) The impression would be removed that meetings are only held in anemergency or for a special purpose, and that definite and striking results shouldbe expected on each occasion.(2) The agenda could be prepared in good time, and memoranda could be exchanged beforehand, so that the Allied representatives would be in a positionto get to grips with business at once at the meetings without taking up time with preliminary expositions of attitude and policy.(3) The practice would help to lay the foundation for the intimate associa-tion between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government, which it ishoped will be one of the abiding results of the war, and which is implicit in thedeclaration of the 28th March. The Supreme War Council may not impossiblygrow into a regular part of the political machinery of the two countries, and beaccepted as such by public opinion. It would continue to meet under anothername after the war, and would deal with all matters of common concern to thetwo countries and not merely with military questions.2.   The proposal for a permanent joint secretariat raises certain difficulties,since experience suggests that better results can be obtained by developingincreasingly close collaboration between existing British and French institutions10966   [21106]
than by super-imposing new inter-Allied organisations upon them. The most practical course might therefore be, as a first experimental step at any rate, toappoint an officer of the present staff of the War Cabinet Offices to be responsiblefor dealing with Supreme War Council business under the direction of theSecretary of the War Cabinet, acting, of course, in close consultation with theForeign Office; and for a similar appointment to be made on the French side.3. The liaison duties of these officers would probably best be confined to matters of routine (convocation of meetings, fixing the agenda, settling the texts of resolutions and checking minutes, and making certain that the decisionsof the Council are communicated promptly to the Departments responsible fortheir execution). Communications between the two Governments on matters ofpolicy connected with meetings of the Supreme War Council would continue tobe handled through the diplomatic channel either in London or in Paris. Thisarrangement would not, of course, affect the continuance of direct liaison on military matters between the French and British High Commands through the channels already established.4. The meetings of the Supreme War Council might bake place at intervals of either a month or three weeks. One month would perhaps be the best interval.A fortnight would be too short.5. It is therefore suggested (1) that the French Government should now be approached with a proposal that meetings of the Supreme War Council shouldbe held at regular intervals of one month alternately in London and Paris, or,if this were found more convenient, at other places in the United Kingdomand France; (2) that the French Government should be informed that, in ourview, the objects which they would seek to secure by the establishment of a JointSecretariat would be better achieved by the establishment of a strong liaison between the War Cabinet Offices and the corresponding French organisation nowbeing established. If they accept this general proposition, we would proposethat the best means of making the contact between the two Offices fruitful and effective would be that a member of the War Cabinet Offices should be chargedwith the duty of dealing with Supreme War Council business as defined inparagraph 3 above; and that we should welcome a similar appointment on theFrench side. It might.be added that we would hope that the French Governmentwould in any event be prepared to give the scheme outlined above a trial; (3) thatthe French Government should at the same time be informed of the advantages which this reform would seem to offer, as set forth in paragraph 1 of this paper.
