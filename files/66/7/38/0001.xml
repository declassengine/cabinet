General Review.THE invasion of the Low Countries by Germany on the 9th May has over-shadowed all other events during the period under review, entailing considerableactivity by our light forces off the Dutch and Belgian coasts.The Norwegian operations have continued to make heavy calls on theHome Fleet.The Mediterranean has been further reinforced.North Sea.2. On the 9th May H.M.S. Birmingham and eight destroyers, on a sweeptowards the Jutland Bank, encountered enemy motor torpedo boats, one of whichsucceeded in torpedoing H.M.S. Kelly. This boat then rammed H.M.S. Bulldog,without causing any serious damage to that ship, and was herself sunk.H.M.S. Kelly was towed to the Tyne, arriving there at 1530/13 after persistentbut unsuccessful bombing by enemy aircraft.   She had nineteen casualties.On the 14th MayH.M. submarine Clyde intercepted a German transport in theStadtlandet area and attacked her by gunfire, but had to break off the engagementdue to low visibility.Operations off the Dutch and Belgian Coasts.3. On the 10th May Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg were invaded, and during the ensuing days a number of destroyers and other small craft, which had-previously been concentrated at Dover and other ports, were employed off theDutch and Belgian coasts providing A/A protection for the troops, shelling enemyparachute troops and aircraft landing on the shore, and a variety of other duties.Demolition parties were landed at Antwerp, The Hook, Flushing andYmuiden.4. Three Dutch merchant vessels with bullion Avere safely escorted to theUnited Kingdom, but a small Dutch pilot vessel with some bullion on board was sunk between Rotterdam and The Hook. Diamond stocks were also transferredto the United Kingdom. A number of Dutch merchant ships was evacuated fromDutch ports, and the S.S. Phrontus arrived in the Downs with 900 prisoners ofwar. Refugees were evacuated from Dutch ports, and on the 13th May H.M. the queen of the Netherlands arrived at Harwich in H.M.S. Hereward; theremainder of the Royal family, the Dutch Government, Diplomatic Corps andLegations Staffs of the Allies also safely arrived in the United Kingdom.5. Mines were laid off the Dutch coast on the night of 9th-10th May andthe 16th May by our destroyers, and H.M.S. Princess Victoria laid a mine-fieldoff Ymuiden on the 11th May.No German surface vessels appear to have been used at all during this period and there is only one doubtful report of a U-boat.6. On the 12th May 200 Royal Marines were landed at The Hook andreinforced next day by the Irish Guards. This force was withdrawn on the14th May, after the demolition of the oil tanks at Rotterdam and Amsterdam hadbeen completed.The Dutch S.S. Princess Juliana (2,968 tons) whilst transporting Dutchtroops from Flushing to Ymuiden was bombed and abandoned, the troops beingtaken off by our destroyers and landed at The Hook.Three M.T.B&apos;s. entered the Zuider Zee on the 12th May to assist in thedefence and left on night of the 14th, having embarked remaining British troops at Ymuiden.On the night of the 14th- 15th May the contemplated evacuation of part ofthe Dutch Army was abandoned, and H.M. Ships were withdrawn from theDutch coast by dawn the 15th.The demolition arrangements were carried out as arranged. At Ymuidenthe 3 lock-gates were destroyed and the channel blocked. At the Hook of Hollandthe Northern breakwater was blown up so as to assist silting of the entrance.7. All our forces which have been operating off the Dutch and Belgiancoasts have been subjected to persistent tack.H.M.S. Versatile was hit by a bomb on the 13th May with a loss of 7 killed and 19 wounded.   She was towed to Sheerness by H.M.S. Janus.[21289] &apos; B
H.M.S. Winchester and H.M.S. Wicern were damaged by near misses.H.M.S. Valentine was hit by 2 bombs on the 15th May off Walcheren, island and beached near Flushing with the loss of 20 killed and 20 seriously wounded..,.&quot;.H.M. Minesweeper Hussar was hit, and had 3 killed and 10 wounded, butreached the United Kingdom safely.H.M.S. WHITSHED was hit on the 10th May and had 1 officer and 1 ratingkilled, 7 seriously wounded and 5 missing. She reports having brought down2 enemy aircraft. :8. The following units of the Dutch Navy reached United kingdom ports :  2 Cruisers Heemskork and Sumatra.1 Destroyer.8 Submarines. , 1 iV2 Torpedo Boats.1 Gunboat.1 Minesweeper.   &apos;1 Minelayer.2 Motor Launches.It is reported that there were 427,600 tons of Dutch and Belgian shipping in their Home ports on the 12th May. These consisted of 8 tankers and 74 others.Some may have sailed since that date. British shipping in Dutch ports isbelieved to have been negligible.Northern Waters./ celand.9. A force of Royal Marines was landed in Iceland by H.M.S. Berwick and h.M.S. Glasgow on the 10th May and were received in a friendly manner by theinhabitants, though an official protest was made. Three merchant vessels(2 Swedish and 1 Danish) were found there and sent to the United Kingdom.The German Consul and staff and 20 prisoners were taken off.Southern Norway.10. H.M. Submarine Taku attacked two transports, screened by two torpedo boats and a large aircraft, in the Skagerrak on the 8th May. She fired tentorpedoes and heard 3 explosions. She was subjected to 3^ hours&apos; depth chargingand had no apparent damage.   One transport was certainly sunk.Central Norway.11. On the 9th May 8 Skuas of the F.A.A. attacked the port of Bergenand the German training cruiser Bremse was hit 3 times. On the 11th May6 Skuas, escorted by Blenheim. fighters of the R.A.F., attacked a small island&apos;near Bergen and set petrol tanks on fire there.Northern A rea.12. On the 10th May the Germans succeeded in landing reinforcements inthe vicinity of Mo from 2 fast coasting steamers and the S.S. Nord Norge. Thelatter was sunk alongside the pier by H.M.S. Calcutta, probably before her storeshad been landed.Reinforcements for our troops at Bodb were successfully landed on the10th and 12th May, but at midnight on the 14th May the transport S.S. Chrobryv, ith Irish Guards for Bodo was attacked by 4 enemy aircraft and set on fireind&apos;abandoned. One thousand survivors were taken off and landed by escortingdestroyers. H.M.S. Somali was also hit, but she is proceeding to the UnitedKingdom under her own power.13. In the early part of the week the weather was unfavourable for operartions against Narvik. Successful combined operations were carried out early.onthe 13th May, troops being landed at Bjerkvik supported by naval bombardment.There has been considerable enemy aircraft, activity in the Narvik area during this period. On the 10th May H.M.S. Vansittart was hit by a bomb and damaged, and suffered casualties.
H.M.S. Penelope and H.M.S. Isis, both in tow of tugs, sailed for the UnitedKingdom on the 10th May and were attacked by aircraft on the 10th and 11th May.H.M.S. Penelope had some casualties from a near miss, one officer and two ratingsbeing killed and 20 wounded. These ships were expected to arrive on the 16th May.H.M.S. Ark Royal, and the A/A cruisers Curlew and Cairo have been operating in this area providing local air defence.Convoys of personnel, A/A equipment and stores have arrived without lossduring the week.Except for one report of a U-boat off Tromso on the 10th May, there has been no activity by U-boats in this area during the period under review.Foreign Waters.14. The French Fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean has been placed underthe general command of the Commander-in-Chief, British Mediterranean Fleet.Further reinforcements of A/ A Cruisers and Destroyers are being sent out.A British force has landed to support the Dutch in Curacao in order toprotect the oil refineries. The French have landed a force at Aruba for the same purpose.Accidents.15. BZ.M.S. Brilliant and H.M.S. Boreas were in collision, and also H.M.S.Grenade with a Trawler on the 14th May. Slight damage was incurred in both cases.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.16. No ships have been reported sunk by U-boats. Four British ships of6,031 tons and 4 neutral ships of 7,893 tons, a total of 13,924 tons, were mined and sunk during the week.Off the Dutch and Belgian coasts 6 Dutch, 2 Belgian and 5 neutral ships were attacked by aircraft.  Details are given in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade. ,,17. A total of 846 ships, of which 76 were neutral and 101 Allied, were convoyed during the week and there were no losses.Since the commencement of hostilities 20,768 ships, including 1,271 allied and 3,063 neutral, have been convoyed, out of which 31 have been sunk, an averageof T in 670. Neutral losses average 1 in 1,021. hOne battleship and 11 armed merchant cruisers were employed as oceanescorts, and 25 destroyers, 19 sloops, 5 corvettes and 2 French submarines on escort duties.Imports in convoy to Great Britain during week ending the 11th May totalled849,904 tons. Oil and motor fuel imports in 21 tankers came to 223,986 tons,of which 10,000 tons were for France. Mineral imports were 182,320 tons. cereal imports came to 159,407 tons, including 17 fully laden grain ships.Anti-Submarine Operations.18. Three attacks were made by aircraft and four attacks by surface vessels,but with no visible results.It is considered that most of the U-boats are still in German ports, with perhaps one in the Western Approaches, one off the Moray Firth and one off the shetlands.German Intelligence.19. It is believed that the battle cruisers Gneisenau and Scharnhorst werein Wilhelmshaven on the 29th April and the new aircraft carrier Graf Zeppelinwas reported to be carrying out exercises with aircraft off Southern Denmark.Information now available confirms that H.M.S. Rawalpindi was sunk bythe battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau on the 13th November.[21289] b 2
German Minelaying.20. Enemy mines have been laid outside Le Havre, about 7 miles north ofthe entrance to the Seine.A report has been received from Narvik that enemy aircraft had been seendropping mines in the approaches in water which was over 100 fathoms in depth.These may be some new kind of mine.British Minesweeping.21. German aircraft laid magnetic mines off Ymuiden. the Hook of holland, Zeebrugge, Ostend, in the East and West Schelde and the FlushingRoads. Magnetic mines may also have been laid off Dunkirk and Calais. Asthe Dutch had no magnetic minesweeping craft, four &quot; LL &quot; trawlers and twodrifters with a magnetic sweep were immediately sent over, followed later by adrifter with a skid.Three mines were exploded off the Hook of Holland on the 12th May. TheD.W.I. formation swept the Ymuiden Channel on the 10th May. A searchedchannel was established from Wandelaar, at the eastern end of the searchedchannel from the North Goodwin, to Flushing, and channels were also clearedinto Ostend and Zeebrugge. Nevertheless, there were a few casualties to merchant ships.22. In a declared dangerous area in the Bristol Channel &quot; LL &quot; sweepsexploded two mines on the 11th May. In the Thames Estuary a magnetic minewas recovered from the Maplin Sands. This brings the total of magnetic minesdealt with up to 173.Nine more mines have been swept up in The Would during the week. Onemine has been swept south of the channel from the North Goodwin to Wandelaar,one in the dangerous area east of the War Channel in the Tyne, and one near theHaisborough Light Vessel.  The total of moored mines to date is 357.23. Trawlers are sweeping the channel to Vest Fjord via Tjelsundet, andthe northern approach to Harstad via Topsundet. The pair of &apos;&apos; LL &apos;&apos; trawlerssent to Narvik are due there on the 16th May. The Norwegian Naval Authoritieshave requested that a swept channel should be maintained through the inshoreend of the British minefield near Bodo, for the use of Norwegian coastguard and supply vessels.A number of D.W.I. aircraft are being sent to Egypt immediately.British Minelaying.24. Minelaying by aircraft in enemy waters has been continued during thepresent week.British and French submarines have laid mines off the Norwegian coasts.Mines were also laid off the Dutch and Belgian coasts as stated in paragraph 5above.German Merchant Shipping.25. The attack on Holland has meant that 28 German ships in Dutchcolonial ports have either been seized in prize or been scuttled. Very recently thelegal attachments on several of these ships were lifted at a cost of about  40,000.On 10th May there were 19 German ships of a total tonnage of 118,870 in theDutch East Indies. One of these, the S.S. Sophie Richmers, 7,033 tons, is reportedto have made an attempt to scuttle, but she was beached and can probablybe salvaged. The other 18 have been seized in prize and the crews interned.There were 8 ships in the Dutch West Indies, totalling 30,105 tons. Three ofthese were set on fire by their crews; of these one was reported to be sinking, butthe fires on the other two had been extinguished. The crew of one ship openedthe sea-cocks, but these were closed later. The S.S. Goslar, 6,040 tons, in DutchGuiana, was scuttled.  All the crews have been interned.There are 7 German ships at Kobe in Japan, of a total tonnage of 55,749 tons.They are stated to have received orders to sail for Vladivostock.26. The total of German mercantile named vessels known to have been captured or sunk now amounts to approximately 625,000 tons, while a further165,000 tons may be added for ships which have&apos; been sunk, though their names
and exact tonnage have not yet transpired. This makes a total of 790,000 tons,reoresenting about 19 per cent, of Germany&apos;s pre-war tonnage, and is some62,000 tons more than the British mercantile losses.Economic Warfare.27. During the week ending 11th May 8,150 tons of cargo destined for germany were seized in prize. The main items include 2,056 tons of base metal,2,145 tons of oil seeds, 1.889 tons of food and 1,000 tons of feeding stuffs. Thetotal cargoes destined for Germany seized in prize since the commencement ofhostilities is 625,600 tons. Against this 472,200 tons has been lost in british ships sunk by enemy action, making a net gain in cargo of 153,400 tons.U.S.S.R.28. It is understood that Estonia has now agreed to the lease of the island of Edenholm off the mouth of the Gulf of Finland.It is believed that certain Russian submarines and patrol craft are taking up positions on patrol about the 15th May as a precaution against any Germanthreat to Russian interests in the Baltic.The Russians are believed to be pressing on with the fortification of their new bases in Estonia, Latvia and Finland.Danube.29. There are reported to be a number of concentrations of barges andlighters suitable for troop transports at Vienna, Passau and Engerau (near the hungarian frontier), and it appears certain that the Germans have stopped all their own down river traffic. It is impossible at present to forecast the date ofa German move in this direction, but it is clear that all preparations have beenmade should a decision be taken. A tug towing four 600 ton barges could, under normal conditions, reach Budapest from the Austrian-Hungarian frontier atPressburg in 10^12 hours and the Iron Gates in Roumania in 40-^45 hours.The Hungarians are more likely to facilitate than oppose such a move. Thereare certain indications of a military agreement between Germany and Hungaryto permit the passage of German troops by water and land towards the south-east.In return for this, Germany may allow Hungary to occupy Slovakia and partsof Transylvania.Italy.30.   The main concentration of the Italian Fleet is at Taranto.There are submarines at Messina, Augusta in Sicily and at Leros in the dodecanese; eight are also reported in the Red Sea.Results of A.A. gunfire from ships.31.

In addition, the Commanding Officer H.M.S. Cairo has reported verballythat when escorting convoy F.P.1 into Aandelsnes his ship had shot down3 aircraft and shore reports stated 2 more crashed on shore. No report yet received.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.32. German ground and air forces attacked Holland, Belgium and luxembourg -burg on the morning of the 10th May. Up to the present 8 armoured, 4 motorisedand 21 infantry divisions, i.e., a total of 33 divisions, of which 22 are active,have been identified as taking part in operations. The total, however, is probablyconsiderably more.The German plan apparently aimed at overrunning Holland and cutting off the Dutch Army from potential Allies in the quickest possible time. Thispart of the plan was carried out as follows : Parachute and air landing troops were landed in the Dordrecht-Rotterdam-Hague area in order to attack the localgarrisons. Simultaneously, attacks by armoured and motorized forces were madeacross the whole length of the Dutch eastern frontier. The progress of these forces was rapid and junction was effected at Dordrecht between them and thetroops landed by air. As a result, the Dutch Army, except those fighting inthe Zeeland area, capitulated on the afternoon of the 14th May.The German forces Which crossed the Belgian and Luxemburg frontiersconsisted of strong armoured and motorized elements. The Meuse was rapidlycrossed, although Liege is still holding out, and enemy pressure on a front fromWalcheren to Montmedy is now being exerted. The principal attacks are being developed in the Mezieres-Sedan area, though the situation east of Sedan seemsto have been stabilized as the result of French counter-attacks. West of Sedanthe situation is obscure, but German troops are reported this morning to havepenetrated as far as Hirson and Montcornet. Between Fumay and Namur theGermans have penetrated some miles west of the Meuse. Both these attacks have been carried out chiefly by armoured and motorized divisions supportedby intense activity on the part of German low-flying and dive-bombing aircraft.It is also believed that the German armoured and mechanised forces whichwere operating against Holland are now preparing to attack from Breda south-west,towards Antwerp. The Germans have carried out their advance with theirusual speed and have adopted throughout &quot; soft spot &quot; tactics.British Expeditionary Force.33. Advanced guards of leading divisions of the British ExpeditionaryForce crossed the Belgian frontier at 1 p.m. on the 10th May. The first phase of the advance to the Dyle position proceeded according to plan and only slightopposition from enemy air forces was met. By the 14th May, the 1st, 2nd and3rd Divisions and some Corps troops had reached their positions on the river.The 12th Lancers and two divisional cavalry regiments acted as a screen forthe advance, and after being fairly heavily engaged by enemy mechanised troops on the 14th retired behind the main position.During the 15th contact was established along the whole front, and the2nd Division on the right and the 3rd Division on the left had to withstandserious attacks, but held their own. The 48th and 4th Divisions moved up intothe 1st and 2nd Corps areas respectively. During the night of the 15th-16th. may the 1st Corps made a short withdrawal in conformation with the movementof French troops on their right: the 5th Division moved up into 2nd Corpsreserve north-east of Brussels. The 4th Division moved up into position onthe left of the 3rd Division, so that both the 1st and 2nd Corps are now deployedon a two divisional front.
Distribution of German Divisions.34.   The distribution of German divisions is believed to be as follows :  Area.	Cav,	Armd.	Mot,	Inf.	Totals.Western Theatre          ...       .......       ...

During the earlier part of the week little was undertaken in the wayof operations, extremely bad weather and the effects of the beginning of the thawon the roads making movement almost impossible. Some forward movement has since taken place on the Ankenes Peninsula, but this has not yet developed intoa threat to the enemy in Narvik itself. On the 13th May the French ForeignLegion, supported by ELM. ships and later reinforced by a Polish battalion,landed at Bjerkvik and effected a junction with the Chasseurs Alpins operating from the north.   The enemy appears to have retired to the east and south.Enemy reinforcements by seaplane and parachute have been landing at,Aefjord, south-west of Narvik, and at Bjoernfjell.Mosjoen.36. Mosjoen was occupied by two British independent companies on the8th May and a severe engagement was fought two days later with German forces&apos;advancing from Namsos. The German forces included tanks. Our two companieswithdrew on the 11th and sailed for Bodo, leaving the enemy in possession ofMosj oen.Mo. &apos;37. About 650 enemy landed at Hemnes from a steamer and seaplanes onthe afternoon of the 10th May. The steamer was torpedoed alongside, probablybefore her stores were unloaded, and the enemy were bombarded by a Britishwarship. The independent company at Mo was joined by a Norwegian company and the two moved down and occupied the Isthmus of Finnet, between Hemnesand Mo. One battalion Scots Guards with detachments of field and light AA.artillery, engineers and S.A.M.C. have been moved by sea from Narvik to Mo.Bodo.38. Four independent companies and a company of Scots Guards are nowin the Bodo area, where the enemy has not yet succeeded in making contact. Onthe night of the 14th-15th May .S.S. Chrobry. en route to Bodp and carrying the1st Battalion the Irish Guards, the 203rd Field Battery, the 230th Field company and one troop of the 3rd Hussars was hit by a bomb and had to be abandoned.A thousand survivors&apos;-have since been landed at Harstaad, but it is feared thatall material was lost, &apos;,
Southern and Central Norway.39. Several reports have been received regarding a concentration ofGerman troops in the Tryssil-Kongsvinger area. The Press gave the strength ofthis concentration as 120,000 but this may be exaggerated.It appears that, owing to the destruction of a bridge on the Oslo-BergenRailway, there is now no direct rail communication between Oslo and Voss.Reinforcements for Bergen will presumably have to be sent by rail and road toStavanger and thence by sea.Iceland.40. The 147th Infantry Brigade and administrative details sailed forIceland on the 14th May.Italy.41. Since the beginning of April 1940 more than thirty independent reports have been received indicating Italian offensive intentions against various placesthroughout the length and breadth of the Mediterranean. This figure excludesthe large number of reports of imminent offensive action against Yugoslavia and greece. The chief military indications suggesting offensive intentions are thepresent strength of the metropolitan army (over 1,400,000), the concentrationson the French and Yugoslav frontiers (23 and 14 divisions respectively), and reports of a concentration at Bari and of the eastward movements of troops in libya to the area of Tobruch and Bardia. To these must be added the fact that several of the larger troop-carrying liners are apparently in a state of readiness.Against these positive indications may be placed a number of independentreports of lack of military activity in centres such as Rome, Naples, Ancona,Bari and Brindisi, the number of untrained recruits now serving and the seeming-lack of A.R.P. measures; and it is thought that reports from Italian East Africaindicate measures undertaken either as a precaution or as a part of the &quot; war ofnerves.&quot; The most recent report from Albania, dated the 8th May, from a reliablemilitary source stated that no troops had recently landed at Durazzo or Valona,and troop movements within the country appear normal. Reports continue to bereceived from various sources, however, indicating that artillery and munitionshave arrived in fairly considerable quantities during the past month. Owing totheir conflicting nature, no reliable estimate can be given as to the quantities ortypes of guns recently landed, but it now seems probable that more have arrivedthan were necessary to complete the equipment of existing corps and divisionalartillery regiments. A large proportion of these guns may be destined for thefortification of such Scutari, Miloti, Kukes, Elbasan, Librasht and strategic areas on the Yugoslav and Greek frontiers, and movements of artillerysupport this view. Contingents of labourers are still arriving, but the total isnot yet known; a recent reliable report confirms the view that their primary role in Albania is not military. It is almost impossible to reach, on military grounds,any firm conclusion as to Italian intentions. Signor Mussolini holds all theService portfolios as well as the destiny of Italy in his hands, and it is obviousthat Italian intervention might take place without any warning.East Africa.42. A battalion of the Northern Rhodesia Regiment left Mombasa forBritish Somaliland on the 11th May as a reinforcement for the Somaliland CamelCorps.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Fighter Command (Home).43. Activity over this country and off the coast has been very slight sinceoperations began in the Western theatre on the morning of Friday, the 10th May.On the 9th May there was considerable daylight activity along the coast; one enemy aircraft was shot down in the Wick area, another was seriously damaged,and there was an inconclusive combat off Yarmouth. There was minelayingduring the following night, 9th-10th May, and anti-aircraft guns were in action
at Chatham and Dover. Early in the morning of Saturday, the 11th May, a fewincendiary bombs were dropped in Kent, in an area remote from all military objectives. Some aircraft were seen over East Anglia during the day, and therewas one inconclusive combat. Since the 10th May there have been fairly continuous enemy patrols off the Belgian and Dutch coast, anti-aircraft guns have been in action on one or two occasions, and one Ju.88 was attacked and damaged. There have been rumours of parachutes seen falling at night, but these have been entirely without confirmation, and may be related tocasualties to barrage balloons.Western Front.Holland.4,4:. The first reconnaissance was made during the morning of Friday, the10th May, North of the Lek, by four Blenheims, one of which failed to return.They reported a large number of transport aircraft, many of them crashed, onYpenburg aerodrome (The Hague), and on beaches in the vicinity; at least fortyor fifty others were seen in the air. Many demolitions had been successfullycarried out, and inundations had begun. The troop movements seen werecomparatively slight. During the day intensive raids were made on thoseaerodromes which were known to be in enemy hands. Waalhaven (Rotterdam)was raided by nine Blenheims, the beach near The Hague by twelve Blen-heims with a fighter escort, and Ypenburg by twelve more Blenheims, which also attacked the beaches and a landing-ground near Leyden. Serious damage was done to the aerodromes and to aircraft on the ground, and many crashedaircraft were seen. The Dutch and Belgian coasts were patrolled during the day by short-range fighters, which destroyed four Junker 52 &apos;s near Scheveningen, and damaged about nine others on the ground. At the same time, patrols were main-tained in the Rotterdam area by Blenheim fighters, which shot down several enemy aircraft. Enemy fighters were very numerous, and four of our bombers and sixfighters were lost. During the afternoon three minesweeping Wellingtons, with fighter escort, swept a channel in the entrance to the Amsterdam Canal atIjmuiden, where magnetic mines were reported to have been laid. FurtherBlenheim reconnaissances in the late evening reported on troop movments nearHengelo and Cleve.45. During the night, Waalhaven aerodrome was attacked by thirty-sixWellingtons, which destroyed many aircraft and started fires among the hangars,while the German lines of approach towards Maastricht and the Dutch frontierwere bombed by nine Whitleys.  All aircraft returned safely.46. On Saturday, the 11th May, a photographic reconnaissance was madeof the Dutch Frisian Islands, and six Blenheims on reconnaissance in the areaNorth of the River Lek had to turn back on account of low cloud. As mostaerodromes were believed to be in Dutch hands, bombing attacks were not renewed,but two squadrons of Hurricanes patrolled the Hague-Amsterdam area and hadnumerous combats. Five failed to return, but at least five enemy aircraft are known to have been shot down, and others were machine-gunned on the ground.Four Hurricane squadrons were engaged in patrolling the Dutch coast south ofIjmuiden during the afternoon.47. On Sunday, the 12th May, one Hudson was lost on a reconnaissance tothe Frisian islands, and a Blenheim shot down a Heinkel while reconnoitringHolland, and was itself damaged. Patrols were maintained by Blenheim fightersto cover landings at the Hook, which were carried out uninterrupted; two enemy fighters and two of our own were shot down. A composite patrol of six Spitfiresand six Defiants shot down two enemy aircraft in the Hague area, and allreturned safely.     Waalhaven aerodrome tacked in the evening by fiveBeauforts and eight Swordfish, with the loss of only one aircraft; heavy smokeover the area made it difficult to observe results.48. On the 13th May, the composite patrol of Spitfires and Defiants was again sent out; at least eight enemy aircraft were shot down, but five Defiantsfailed to return and another forced-landed. Reconnaissances were maintained,covered by Blenheim fighter patrols which shot down one Me. 110, and a specialpatrol of four Blenheim fighters covered the evacuation of the Dutch Governmentand Royal Family. Seven Battles of the B.A.F.F. made a successful raid oninechanised columns advancing in the Breda area, and all,returned safely, coveredby fighter patrols.[21289] c
49. On Tuesday, the 14th May, the same area was again raided by sixBlenheims, without loss, and fighters covered the evacuation of the Hook, whichwas carried through without incident. Immense fires were seen everywhere, andgreat stocks of oil appeared to have been destroyed.France and Belgium.50. The day of Thursday, the 9th May, was quiet, apart from two indecisivecombats on the Saar front. Operations were begun on the 10th May by earlyraids on five of our aerodromes, which had no very great success; five Battleswere slightly damaged. During the day thirty-two Battles were in action againstthe enemy&apos;s columns as they advanced through Luxembourg; their attacks wereeffective in spite of well-organised mobile anti-aircraft defences, but thirteenaircraft were lost. Twelve reconnaissances were flown in the B.E.F. area, withthe loss of three aircraft.51. On Saturday, the 11th May, attacks were again made on our aerodromes;the most effective of these was at Rheims, where five Battles were destroyed andothers rendered unserviceable. The aerodrome itself was not seriously damaged.During the day our main raids were directed against the Maastricht and luxembourg areas. The former was attacked by twenty-three Blenheims, of which two were lost; the crossings of the Meuse were heavily bombed, as were the roadsbetween Maastricht and Tongres. Eight Battles raided the Luxembourg-Dippachroad, and four were shot down. Reconnaissances were maintained in Belgiumthat day and during the following night, with the loss of three Blenheims. Duringthe night the main weight of attack was against communications radiating fromMunchen-Gladbach; eighteen Whitleys and fifteen Hampdens were engaged, withthe loss of only one aircraft.52. Enemy raids on the morning of the 12th May were not very effective and resulted only in damage to a single Hurricane; at Rheims three Dorniersturned away in face of machine-gun fire from the ground. Heavy attacks were again directed against columns on the two main lines of advance. opposition had been intensified in the Maastricht-Hasselt-Tongres area, which was attacked by thirty-three Blenheims and five Battles; photographs taken showed that three off the Meuse bridges in the Maastricht area were down, and that pontoon bridgeswere under construction. Most of our aircraft succeeded in dropping their bombs,but twenty-one failed to return. Nine Battles attacked columns in the Bouillonarea and pontoon bridges over the Semoise; opposition here was less effective and only two aircraft were lost. Twelve reconnaissances were flown on the B.E.F.front, without loss.53. During the night the 12th-13th May, the attack on the Hasselt-Tongresarea was renewed by eighteen Blenheims, only one of which failed to return inspite of heavy A.A. fire near Maastricht. Communications further east, betweenthe Dutch frontier and the Rhine, were attacked by six &quot;Wellingtons and sixWhitleys; searchlights and ground defences were very active and made observationdifficult, but there were no losses.54. There was only one enemy aerodrome raid on Monday, the 13th May,which destroyed one aircraft. Over twenty-five reconnaissances were flown inthe B.E.E. area, with the loss of two aircraft. There was no bombing activityduring the day, but at night twelve heavy bombers operated against enemy communications and returned safely. Bombs were dropped in the Maastricht-Maeseyck well as further north round Eindhoven.55. On the following day, Tuesday, the 14th May, the enemy thrust in thejSedan area had developed so far that a special call was received for bombersupport, and a very large force of medium bombers was engaged with all availablefighter assistance. 102 Blenheims and Battles were employed against the denseenemy mechanised columns and against the crossings of the Meuse and Semoise,near Sedan and Bouillon. An immense weight of bombs was dropped, againstheavy opposition, and prisoners&apos; reports indicate that the strain of continuedbombing was severely felt. Forty-one aircraft were lost, but at least seven enemy fighters were shot down by the bombers. Activity on the B.E.F. front duringthe day was limited to reconnaissance; fourteen sorties were flown, and four aircraft lost.   The scale of attack on the enemy&apos;s rear areas was, however,
intensified during the following night, the 14th-15tih May. Forty-two heavy bombers were engaged and made extensive attacks in the regions of Maastricht,Hasselt and Munchen-Giadbach, as well as on communications through Hollandabout Breda and Rcosendaal. Photographs taken on the following day byBlenheim aircraft over the Sedan area, show that six bridges over the Meusehave been destroyed and one pontoon bridge exists, but another is being con-structed immediately south of the town. The road from Francheval-Porvu auBois has been rendered temporarily impassable by craters about 400 yards east of Francheval.56. On Wednesday, the 15th May, eighteen reconnaissances were flown inthe B.E.F. area, with the loss of seven aircraft. Further south, raids wererenewed along the Meuse near Dinant and Montherme, where opposition wasnot so severe as it had been in the Sedan area on the previous day; of twenty-eight Blenheims engaged all but three returned safely. There were again attacks on our aerodromes, one of which is reported unserviceable, but only one aircraft was destroyed.57. During the following night six heavy bombers were employed at Dinant,three near Turnhout and three near Aachen. Twenty medium bombers of theA.A.S.F. made sustained attacks on transport and on petrol reserves in the Sedanarea with the object of causing the maximum dislocation to enemy movements.The main weight of attack was, however, in the Ruhr area of the Rhineland,where ninety-three bombers were engaged, of which only one failed to return.The objectives struck at were very numerous, but the following may be mentioned:  Railway-j unctions and marshalling yards at Aachen, Roermond, Dortmund,Bocholt, Wesel, Munchen-Giadbach, Koln.The autobahn south of Duisburg.Oil-plants at Dortmund, Duisburg, Homburg, and other places.Blast-furnaces and coking-plants at Arnsberg and Hamborn.Aerodromes at Duisburg and Eindhoven.Opposition was relatively slight, and the results appeared to be highly successful.Explosions and fires were started by the attacks on the oil-plants.58. Fighter activity during the week has been continuous and mostintensive. The results of individual day&apos;s combats cannot be set out in detail,but the achievement of the squadrons of the B.A.F.F. may be summarised asfollows : EnemySorties.    shot down.   Damaged.   Losses.R.A.F. Component    ...      810 111 3 35A.A.S.F. ......      279 70 21 14Total        ......    1,089 181 24 49In addition, eight enemy aircraft were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire at our aerodromes. Very successful patrols to which reference has already been madewere also maintained by Fighter Command along the Belgian and Dutch coasts.Norway.59. Coastal reconnaissance was maintained regularly throughout the weekwithout special incident. During the night the 9th-10th May a force of nineWhitleys was despatched to raid Stavanger aerodrome but had to be recalled onaccount of bad weather; one aircraft which went on reported very bad visibility.A reconnaissance on the 12th May reported that the aerodrome was again in use;about sixty aircraft were present, and there were five seaplanes in the anchorage.Shipping, oil tanks and seaplanes in the neighbourhood of Bergen were raided on three occasions (9th, 11th and 12th May) by Skuas of the Fleet Air Arm, escorted by Blenheim fighters, one of which was shot down. Two oil tanks are reportedto have been set on fire. On the 13th May a single Hudson again bombed shipping in the harbour, and reported one near miss.[21289]    . D
North Sea.60. Reconnaissances during Thursday, the 9th May, showed that the usualFlak ship patrols in the Heligoland Bight and off the Danish coast had been withdrawn, and reports were made giving the position of enemy destroyers sightedoff Jutland. Several Dornier flying boats were attacked during the day byHudsons on escort duty; at least one and probably a second were shot down andtwo others were damaged. During the night of the 9th/10th May security patrols were maintained off enemy seaplane bases by six Wellingtons which reportedonly minor movements of shipping.61. On Friday, the 10th May, escort was provided for British naval forcesoff Jutland, and on this and subsequent clays for H.M.S. Kelly during her returnto her base after suffering damage from a torpedo. Three Dornier 18 flying boats were attacked, and two of them were seen to be in difficulties. On the 11th Maya Hudson on convoy escort bombed a submarine 120 miles off the Scottish Coastwithout observed result, and other aircraft engaged in similar work attacked and drove off Heinkel bombers which were attacking the convoy. On the 12th Maybombs were dropped by an Anson aircraft on a moving patch of oil which seemedto indicate the presence of a submarine, but the attack was apparentlyunsuccessful.62. On the 13th May seven mine-sweepers and four Flak ships were seerand attacked near Horns Reef; one of the latter was seriously damaged by a verT-near miss. An attempt to reconnoitre Emden from a high altitude on the14th May was foiled by cloud conditions. A submarine was sighted in theWestern Approaches on that dav, and oil and bubbles were seen in two places offthe East coast during the 15th May, possibly indicating the presence of sub-marines. On the 15th May there were two indecisive combats between Germanbombers and Anspns on convoy patrol toward the Dutch coast.Mine-laying operations were continued almost nightly during the week.There were twenty-three successful sorties on the 9th/ 10th May, four on the11th/12th May, three on the 13th/14th and twenty on the 14th&apos;/15th.French Air Operations.63. Since the opening of the Western offensive the activities of the French air Force have been on the same lines as our own, though no precise figures for enemy aircraft destroyed or for losses are yet available. They were less heavilyengaged than ourselves in operations in support of Holland, and full activitytherefore developed slightly later than it did. with the Royal Air Force. Nightraids have been regularly executed, particularly in the Maastricht area, and therehave been intensive efforts in conjunction with our own bombers to check theGerman thrust across the Meuse. Enemy attacks on aerodromes have beenextensive, but not very intense; thirty-six aerodromes have been raided once,fifteen twice, and three three &quot;times, but only one has been rendered unserviceable.AIR INTELLIGENCE.German Air Operations.General.64. The German Air Force has been employed during the week in intensiveoperations directed at the invasion of Holland and the support of land forces operating against Belgium and France.All units of the long-range bomber force are now operating on the western front with the exception of two Geschwardern, one of which is still in Norway,and the other believed to be consolidating after its return from Norway. the intensity of activity both in Holland and on the Western Front has been steadily increasing. It is known that on occasion aircraft have been drawn from all threeStaffeln of a bomber Gruppe in order to provide tactical formations of twelve ormore aircraft. This may be an indication of the effects of the intensity of operations on the serviceability of the bomber force.65. Information in regard to the other types of units is still scarce. Therehas been a decrease in training activity during the past few days and some schoolaircraft, probably Ju. 52&apos;s, nave been moved from the Upper Danube- to theFreiborg district. There are, however, no signs that aircraft have been diverted from training to operations.
No detailed estimate of German losses is yet available, but those inflicted bythe Royal Air Force are dealt with in paragraph 58. Including those claimed by the Dutch, the total is estimated to be 628.Holland.66. German operations were opened by a bombing attack on Schipholaerodrome, the barracks at Amsterdam and anti-aircraft emplacements nearby;soon after German parachutists were landed at key-points in and near TheHague, at Delft, Zandvoord, The Hook, Ijmuiden, Eindhoven, Dordrecht, and onWaalhaven aerodrome near Rotterdam. Those dropped at Waalhaven woreBritish and Dutch uniforms and succeeded in seizing the aerodrome. In spiteof measures taken to deny the use of aerodromes to an invader, four majoraerodromes in Fortress Holland (Waalhaven, Ypenburg, Ockenburg, andValkenburg) were in German hands on the afternoon of the 10th May, and Germantransport aircraft were landing large numbers of troops. Two of theseaerodromes were subsequently recaptured by the Dutch, but aircraft were alsolanded in considerable numbers on the beaches at Katwijk, Scheveningen andWassenaar in an effort to capture The Hague. The combined effect of theselandings, which were continued with great intensity, and covered by fighters, wasto immobilise one army corps inside Fortress Holland and to secure Germancontrol of the Dordrecht district and the southern part of Rotterdam. They thushad a decisive effect on the campaign, and on the 16th May, low-flying attacks were exerting very severe pressure on the French and Dutch forces on the ScheldtIslands.67. At the outset of the war the Dutch Air Force had a first line strengthof about 248 aircraft. By the 13th May, this was reduced to a total of ten, andin the course of that day these ten aircraft were lost in an attack on Germanformations behind the Grebbe line. Only two of the K.L.M. Fleet of civil aircraftescaped to this country.   The remaining thirteen were immobilised at Schipholresult of the bombing of the aerodrome.68. Full information is not yet available on the serviceability of aerodromes and landing grounds which are now in German hands, but it is known that Teugeand a number of other aerodromes in Eastern Holland were ploughed up beforethe invasion, that Flushing and Waalhaven are now unserviceable, and that otheraerodromes (probably including Valkenburg and Bergen) have been destroyed.France and Belgium.69. On the 11th May large formations of German long-range bombers were operating over France. There were a number of air raids on aerodromes and adjacent towns, while intense German air activity was reported East of the RiverDyle in the evening. Attacks in the neighbourhood of Brussels were carried outevery four hours.70. On the 12th May eleven aerodromes in France were bombed, but no greatdamage was inflicted. Bombs were also dropped on 18 towns in France, includingMaubeuge, Givet, Sedan and St. Menehould, and in districts to the north ofRheims and Verdun. The majority of these raids crossed the Rhine south ofStrasbourg. Parachutists are reported to have been dropped south of Vouziers,north of Troyes, east of Meaux and north of La Perthe. That evening and onthe morning of the 13th May German aircraft carried out heavy attacks nearNamur. These took place hourly, and as many as 40 aircraft were observed in individual raids. Antwerp, Louvain, Courtrai and Tournai were also bombed.Aircraft were generally active in supporting land operations and attackingAllied columns. Numbers of parachutists were reported to have landed in theForet de Soignes and elsewhere, and power stations and factories in belgium to have been sabotaged.During the afternoon, aircraft working in groups of 15 were also very activeall over northern and central France. Isolated groups of aircraft were reported from various points in central and north-eastern France and parachutists are believed to have been dropped near Paris, Coulommiers, Romilly and Chalons.Numerous offensive operations were also conducted in the areas Namur, Givet andJoument. Armoured divisions, which were attacking in the vicinity of Tirlemont,were also supported by a large number of bombers.[21289] d 2
71. Operations in support of land forces were continued on the 14th, andby the 15th it was apparent that all units of the long-range bomber force werebeing employed at maximum intensity and that losses were probably causing theformation of composite units. Aircraft continued to support land operations by heavy bombing and machine-gun attacks, supported by fighters, on communi-cations and towns. Dive bombers were being employed south-west ofLuxembourg. Frequent requests for dive bomber support were made by land forces to attack fortresses in the Liege and Mezieres districts, and it was estimated that about 60 per cent, of the dive bomber force was being employed.Heavy attacks were also made on shipping off the Dutch coast, and these causedsome losses, as described in the Naval Situation. On the 16th May the.main effort was still being concentrated in support of land operations, and the usual Germantechnique of bombing attacks, followed by A.F.V. attacks, was being pursued.The bombers were supported by very large numbers of fighters.Norway and Denmark.72. The dropping of some parachutists was reported near Narvik, but otherwise the only activity in this area was the attacks on transports and naval units described in the Naval Situation.73. Kastrup (Copenhagen) is now fully employed as a German militaryaerodrome, and large numbers of aircraft have been seen dispersed around the perimeter. Landing grounds are being constructed at a new site near Aalborgand at five other places in North Jutland. The old aerodrome at Aalborg issaid to be quite unserviceable although a macadam road near by can be used for landing and taking off. It is known that repair work is still being continuedupon the original aerodrome.Netherlands East Indies.74. As there is no serious danger of air attack except by ship-borne aircraft,the air defence rests chiefly on nine squadrons of, Glenn Martin long-range bombers, which make up a total of 81 aircraft with about 50 per cent, reserves.It is intended that these bombers should subject raiding forces to long-rangebombing attacks and so impede and delay landings until aid could arrive fromother interested Powers. These bombers are supported by one squadron (twelveaircraft) of Fokkers suitable only for short-range reconnaissance and by a numberof Dornier flying boats. About sixty of the latter have been delivered and thefirst-line strength may be reckoned at thirty. Twenty Curtiss fighters have been ordered in the United States, but delivery is not likely to be completed for sometime.Italy.75. The aircraft strength of squadrons in the Rome area has been brought up to war establishment. If similar expansion is completed throughout theMetropolitan Air Force, it will mean an increase in first-line strength of some240 bombers and 180 fighters.It is now confirmed that units in the North of Italy are dispersing their aircraft each morning to satellite aerodromes, returning to their bases for the night.Civil aviation agreements have been signed with Hungary, Yugo-Slavia and roumania, which provide for several additional services in the Balkans. On the1st May the service from Rome to Sofia via Albania was reopened with italian aircraft and was made the occasion of a public reception at the Sofia airport.Spain.76. Twelve more bombers are reported to have been concentrated in Majorcaand thirteen seaplanes have landed at Pollenza Bay in the North of the Island.It is reported that the German Lufthansa are now maintaining a service to spain, although somewhat irregularly. The route flown is probably from Stutt-gart to Locarno and thence via Genoa to Barcelona. On a recent journey fromGermany to Spain one aircraft is said to have carried torpedo parts for the armament factory at Cadiz. The freight carried on the return journey toGermany appears to consist mainly of wolfram.
