DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY. &apos;It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.secret^BT APRIL. 1940.COPY NO.WAR CABINET.IMPLICATIONS OF POSSIBLE ITALIAN ACTION IN THEMEDITERRANEAN.Report &quot;by the Chiefs of Staff Committee,In the light of the recent trend of italian policy we have been instructed&quot; to submit our views onthe strategic implications in the Mediterranean area.&apos;present campaign in Scandinavia must inevitably havea profound effect on any operations which we mighthave to conduct in the Mediterranean, if we were at warwith Italy,      The full implications of operations in Norway in relation to the war as a whole, arethe subject of a report which we shall shortly besubmitting to the War Cabinet, and we therefore confineourselves in the present report to a broad statementof our views on this aspect of the problem.2.At the outset we would point out that theWar Cabinet 96th Meeting, Minute 8.

30 Briefly, our view is that we should find it too great a strain on our Naval and Airresources to conduct operations in Norway on the present scale?to . hold the position in the West and, atthe sarnetime^to go to war with Italy in theMediterranean,,       In the eventp    therefore9 of ourfinding ourselves at war with Italy we feelthat we should have no alternative hut to cutour losses in NorwayQ     This we should proposeto do by withdrawing British troops from southern norway, whilst making every endeavour to secureNarvik before the ice melts in the Gulf of Bothnia^We appreciate the disadvantages which theabandonment of Southern Norway would involve,but consider that we should have to accept them.4. . The advantages and disadvantages of goingto war with Italy at the present juncture .may be *iesummarised swa below0     The further implication^ of spanish intervention against us is considered in alater paragraph,,5e (a) Advantages of War with Italyo(i)   We should tighten our economic blockade of Germany j, to whom Italy might well become an economic liability0(ii)    If Turkey implements her treaty obliga-tions with us,  ( and this would dependon the attitude of Russia at the time),we could still further tighten our economic blockade of both Germany andItaly,(iii)   Italy might ultimately become a militaryliability to Germany, particularly inview of the unpreparedness of her land and air forces and the vulnerabilityof her industrial areas and of the sea communications to her African colonies.

(la-)   Disadvantages of War with Italy.,(i)    We are already heavily committed in scandinavia and faced with the constantthreat of German attack against theWestern Front and the United Kingdom.War with Italy would necessarily causefurther dispersion of our strength whichmay well &quot;be Germany&apos;s strategic aim.(ii)    Our sea communications through theMediterranean and in the Red Sea would &quot;be temporarily interrupted.      This would meanan added strain on our shipping and greater difficulty in maintaining our forces inthe Middle East.(iii)    The weakness of our forces in theMediterranean - area will preclude us from giving any direct assistance to thosecountries with whom we have contractual obligations in the Mediterranean area,6. In our view there is no doubt that the intervention of Italy on the side of Germany at the present juncturewould, at any rate on a short-term view, add greatly toour difficulties.      It is to our interest, therefore, tokeep Italy out of war, and all the resources of diplomacyand propaganda should be exerted to this end,      Wesuggest that the measures to deter Italy from entering the war, which were listed in W.P, (2+0) 130, should,  as a first step, be examined by the War Cabinet07. In the present situation, we think that Italy mayadopt any of the following courses:-(a) Direct intervention on the side of Germany.(b) Aggression against a neutral country taking-advantage of the present pre-occupationsof the Allies elsewhere.(c) Continued neutrality, accompanied by threats.Direct Intervention on the side of Germany..8*   . We consider allied strategy in the event of warwith Italy in a later section of this paper.

Af;p;reJlJ?X......Italy in tlie Balkans.9, Italian aggression in the Balkans may he directed against Yugoslavia or Greece,The political consequences of our taking no actionin the event of an Italian attack on Yugoslavia have been set out in Foreign Office telegram to Paris No.  100 DIPP,dated 18th April,  191+0 .      From this it is clear thatthere is every prospect that the whole of our political influence in South East nurope might,  in these circumstances,collapse.      If this is so in the case of a country with whom we have no contractual obligations,  the effects wouldhe even worse if we failed to take any action to supportGreece, to whom we have given a guarantee.The effect on our strategic position,were the BalkanPowers to come within the Italian and German orbit withoutresistance^would be extremely serious, and needs noelaboration in this paper.      The military consequences ofany change in Turkey&apos;s policy have even wider hnplications.10.       For these reasons we are of the opinion that the disadvantages to the Allies of going to war with Italy inthe event of her aggression against either Yugoslavia orGreece at the present juncture,  though very serious, wouldbe outweighed by the effects of inaction.      Moreover,either eventuality would almost certainly lead to war withthe Allies at a later date, when the military disadvantagesto ourselves would be considerably increased.H -      There remains to consider the possibility of italian aggression being confined,  in the first place,  tothe seizure of a limited objective, such as Corfu,  and ofthe situation arising in which Greece did not activelyx Attached as Annex..

resist..      In this event we should not necessarily helegally committed by the terms of our guarantee and theresults of an Italian occupation of Corfu would notappreciably change the situation strategically..     It seemsto us likely however that the political consequences ofinaction in this instance would be the same as those wehave outlined above, but this is not for us to assess.Continued Neutrality.12.       A continuation of Italy&apos;s present threatening anduncertain attitude itself imposes a measure of dispersion;for instance we are now concentrating in the Mediterraneannaval forces which can ill be spared from other areas.We have not, however,, at our disposal sufficientforces to deter Mussolini from intervening if he has made up his mind to do so.Allied Strategy in the Event of War with Italy.15.       It is clear that there is nothing we can do to afford direct assistance to Yugoslavia or Greece untilthe Italian threat to our communications has been eliminated,On the other hand Italy, if at war with us,, would, employItalian forces on the Trench frontier and in her colonial empire which would tend to reduce her military effort inthe Balkans.14.       In the circumstances now existing, sufficient allied forces are not available to carry out a direct attack on italy or her colonies, and until further forces can be madeavailable our strategy must necessarily be primarilydefensive.

15.   Allied.fleets could, be concentrated in sufficient strength to safeguard our vital interests namely:-(a) The control of the Straits of Gibraltar and the communications with French North Africa.(b) The security of Egypt and the Suez C; nal againstseaborne attack-(c) The maintenance of communications through the red sea to a limited degree.It might further be possible to afford some measureof security to the Allied lines of sea communications to turkey.     Through Mediterranean, shipping would, in theearly stages, have to be diverted round the Cape.16.   Sufficient Allied land forces exist to ensure thesecurity of the Franco-Italian frontier, Egypt and AlliedColonial dependencies. at malta we should hope that the garrison would be able tohold out until relieved.17.   In the air, Italian hostility would involve aserious dispersion from the Western Front to the italian frontier.     The Air Forces in Egypt, Malta and Aden, are far &quot;below the strength required for defence against serious and prolonged attack.18.   Although in these circumstances our strategy wouldbe primarily defensive our control of Gibraltar and the suez Canal would cut Italy1s communications to the outerseas and with East Africa.     We might also hope to interruptcommunications with Libya by the operation of light forces and submarines in the Central Mediterranean.      Though a french offensive against Libya remains a possibility inprinciple, such an offensive could not be immediatelyundertaken.     Ultimately it should be our intention toundertake an offensive against Italian East Africa combined with measures to raise the Abyssinians.

19.       Propaganda..directed against the Home Front, andespecially in the industrial north, is likely to obtainvaluable results and should be exploited to the utmost.20,       It seems likely that the quickest and most effective method of bringing pressure to bear on italy would be by air attack on the concentration of war industries in the Milan - Turin area.      In the presentcircumstances, forces could only be made available atthe expense of our security in the United Kingdom andon the Western FrontoNevertheless this course of action is one whichholds out real prospects of important results, and weshould not hesitate to undertake it if circumstances permit.      This question should be discussed with theFrench at an early date,Spanish Intervention against the Allies.21.       If, in addition to Italy Spain should join our enemies, our strategic position would be made far moredifficult, particularly in that our hold on the western mediterranean would be weakened.In the time available we have been unable toexamine the full implications of the situation in thesecircumstances but would draw attention to the followingdifficulties in particular(i) In She event of Italian and/or German air bases being established in Spain we should,withine present serious lack of anti-aircraft defences at Gibraltar, have to face the very strong probability of notbeing able to use that place as a Naval base.(ii) Our supplies of iron ore from French North .African Ports would be liable to seriousinterruption.(iii) The route to the Gape would be exposed to air attack and an increased scale of submarine attack.

22.       Nevertheless we feel that the dangers of inactionoutlined in paragraphs 9 and 10 above outweigh the disadvantages even of Spanish intervention,23.       To sum up:(a) It ic in our interests to keep Italy out ofthe war at the present juncture.      Neverthe-less we cannot afford to acquiesce in anyItalian aggression in the Balkans, however,limitedo(b) We should find it too great a strain on our naval and air resources to conduct operations in Norway on the present scale, to hold theposition in the West and, at the same timeto go to war with Italy.     We consider thatwe should cut our losses by withdrawing from southern Norway whilst   making every endeavour to secure NARVIK,(c) In the event of war with Italy our present   naval and land forces are adequate toI   ensure the security of our vital interests,/   though we are dangerously weak in air forces.(d) Initially our major strategy would have to bei    defensive but at the same time we should bei    exerting economic pressure on Italy.      InI    due course there should be opportunitiesi    for ^.ocal offensives in Libya and Italianj    East Africa0i(e) Italy is particularly vulnerable to air attack on her north western industrial area, we should be prepared to undertake this if circumstances permit,(f) The entry of Spain into the war as anenemy would make the Allied strategic position more difficult, but should not affect the conclusions above.Recommendations *24.       We recommend:-(a) That the measures to deter Italy from entering the war, which were listed in w.P.(40) 130 should, as a first step, be examined by the War Cabinet,(b) That full resources of diplomacy and propaganda should be directed to keepingItaly out of the war,(c) That in the event of Italian aggression against Greece or Yugoslavia we should go towar with Italy, accepting the fact that thiswould probably entail the withdrawal ofBritish forces from Southern Norway and therestriction of the campaign in Scandinaviato operations in the Narvik area.

ANNEXSPECIAL DISTRIBUTION AND WAR CABINETTo:    FRANCECypher telegram to Sir R. Campbell,  (Paris).Foreign Office, April 18th, 1940,    9.15 p.m.Wo. 100 LIPP.IMMEDIATEYour telegram No.  133 (Dipp).We agree with French Government that unless therewere appropriate re-action on the part of Allies theconsequences of an Italian attack on Yugoslavia may bevery serious.    This would, certainly be the case in SouthEastern Europe and possibly also in Turkey.2. We do not however agree that the action of theAllies should be made wholly dependent on that of Turkey,Greece and Roumania0   &apos;The policy of these countries willbe decided by the action of the Allies and by nothing else..If the Allies,  in anticipation of an Italian attack on yugoslavia, try to force these countries to commit themselves in advance of Great Britain and France, theywill at once take alarm and draw the obvious conclusionthat the Allies are trying to evade the issue and place the ultimate responsibility on them.3* It is not conceivable that Roumania could, even if she would, be of any assistance to Yugoslavia if attacked&quot;by either Italy or Germany.    It therefore seems quiteuseless to approach her on this subject with either requestsor warnings.

4. As for Turkey, we have addressed to Angora a similarenquiry to that contained in our telegram to you No.  94 andare at present awaiting the Turkish Government&apos;s reply.It is probable that the latter will take the line that ifthe British and French Governments consider that thedefence of their vital interests requires them to take partin a war between Italy and Yugoslavia, they will be readyat once to join in virtue of Article 2 of the Treaty of alliance,5. Although the Turkish Government have,  as we know,protested that they are not yet ready to embark on a warwith the Soviet Government, I doubt whether they will use this argument to dissuade Great Britain and France fromgoing tc the assistance -;f Yugoslavia, for it must beremembered that the Turkish Government have alwaysconsidered that from their point of view the primary objectcf the Tripartite Treaty of Alliance was to make it possible for Turkey to go to war with Italy in alliance withGreat Britain and France.6. As for Greece, she certainly would not respond tany representations such as suggested by the FrenchGovernment unless she was assured in advance of the policyof Great Britain and France cn the one hand and Turkey onthe other,,    As soon as she was sure that these three countries were resolved to take action she would probablyhe ready to offer such, co-operation and assistance as waswithini  her power.^&apos; Such being the probable attitude of Roumania, turkey and Greece, it seems to His Majesty&apos;s Government that itwould be not only waste of time but might produce the most fortunate misunderstandings if Great Britain and France-2-

oT,P to do nothing more at this juncture than to propose to thefour States concerned that, in view of a possible attack on yugoslavia, they should create a united military front against aggression.-,3,        As for the attitude which Yugoslavia might he expectedto adopt in the face of an attack by Italy, here again I fear that our two Governments will have to make up their .minds without being sure of Yugoslavia&apos;s reaction.-.      What however can  besafely asserted is that Yugoslavia is much more likely to offerresistance if she knew In advance that if Italy attackedYugoslavia Italy would in her turn be attacked by Great Britain,Prance, and Turkey,      But even so the fact must be faced thatGermany would probably intervene on Italy&apos;s behalf either bythreats or by actual invasion, and that in that case Yugoslaviamight decide to capitulate even if assured of the support o Great Britain, Prance and Turkey.      But whether Yugoslaviaput up any resistance or not, a decision to do nothing but wait[for the Balkan States to take the initiative would still produce a disastrous effect on our position in South East Europe.9&apos;     To sum up.      We are much impressed by the danger of doing nothing in the event of an attack on Yugoslavia.      If Mussoliniis allowed to achieve a quick and spectacular success there is every prospect that the whole of our political influence inSouth East Europe will collapse.      It must also be lborne in mind[hat once Italy has involved herself In war with Yugoslavia sheFill have taken the first step which is almost inevitably bound;to lead ,her into war with the Allies at some later   date, andPossibly xn conditions which mya be worse for the Allies than thoseI   present existing.      This would certainly be the ca.se if asResult of the Allies having failed to intervene topr.event.it.

\ i-j s3the states of South Eastern Europe and possibly even Turkeydecided that their only course was to compound with Germanyand Italy as quickly as they could.      On the other hand, aprompt reaction on the part of the Allies might usefullyencourage the anti-war elements in Italy, and more particularlyin the industrial north to oppose the Government beforeMussolini had been able to consolidate opinion behind him.10.        His Majesty&apos;s Government trust that the French Govern-ment will examine the problem once again in the light of theabove considerations.      It is obvious that before reaching a decision our two Governments must give full weight to the purely military and naval considerations involved.     HisMajesty&apos;s Government are therefore asking their Chiefs of staff to examine the problem at once, and they hope the FrenchGovernment will give similar instructions.... to their Chiefs ofStaff.     The line of enquiry which His Majesty&apos;s government propose to ask their Chiefs of Staff to pursue is the following:1) How would the Chiefs of Staff appreciate the situation of going to war with Italy in present circumstances?2) Would they regard the disadvantages of such a war asso great that they must be accepted as conclusive?3) If,  on the other hand, the Allies were to decide on war, what action would they be able to take?11*       As soon as the two Governments are in possession of theviews of their Chiefs of Staff they ought without loss of timeto review the problem in all its aspects and reach without delaya decision both as regards the policy they propose to adopt inthe event of an attack on Yugoslavia and the manner in whichthey would hope to apply that policy.      Meanwhile, as already stated, we are awaiting the views of the Turkish Government, nd we have now also addressed an enquiry direct to the yugoslav Government, as shown in my telegram to Belgrade No. 113. ,the substance of which you should communicate to the FrenchGovernment.Repeated to Angora No.  246.-4-
