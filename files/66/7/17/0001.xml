NAVAL SITUATION.Northern Waters.OUR naval forces on the Norwegian coast are employed as follows :  (a) To maintain a close blockade of Narvik and support military forces inthis area.(b) To support military forces in the Namsos and Aandalsnes area.(c) To prevent enemy reinforcements reaching the Trondheim area.(d) Submarines to operate in the Skagerrak and off the south-west coast of Norway against enemy lines of communication.(e) Carrier-borne aircraft to afford protection to military forces.At Aandalsnes and Aalesund the Navy landed parties to anticipate possibleenemy action and to hold these positions pending the arrival of the troops andmarines. These parties are at present forming part of the garrisons of thesetwo bases.The Northern Patrol between Iceland and Faroes, which was withdrawnon the 7th April, has been resumed.A chronological summary of the principal events in Norwegian waters isgiven below.Thursday, April 18.2. During the afternoon an attack was made by enemy aircraft on H.M.S.Furious at Tromso. No hits were registered, but slight damage was caused toturbines by a near miss, which has reduced her maximum speed to 22 knots.S.S. Chrobry completed unloading stores at Namsos during the night of the18th-19th. The disembarkation of Brigadier Morgan&apos;s Brigade at Aandalsnesand Molde began at 2100 and was completed early on the 19th without opposition&apos;.:H.M.S. Black Swan, at Aandalsnes, and H.M.S. Cairo, in Skjell Fjord, wereunsuccessfully attacked by enemy aircraft.Friday, April 19.3. The first French convoy, consisting of four transports, arrived off Namsosand completed disembarkation during the night of the 19th-20th. The Frenchcruiser Emile Bertin, which was escorting them, was attacked by enemy aircraft and damaged by one hit which necessitated her immediate return to Scapa.H.M. Ships Cairo, Arethusa, Afridi and Auckland were attacked unsuccessfully.t A convoy of empty French transports returning was unsuccessfully attackedoy a U-boat 100 miles to the westward of Namsos.I Saturday, April 20.: 4. The transport Franconia, escorted by H.M.S. Repulse, arrived at Vaagspjord. H.M.S. Furious on passage from Tromso to Harstad carried out airj reconnaissances in the Vaags Fjord area. One aircraft made a forced landingl)ie5.vin8&apos; only nine serviceable). During this operation the German trawler RheinI (^54 tons) was captured and taken to Harstad.\ Large scale enemy air attacks were made in the Namsos area. The town was\ 011 fire and an anti-submarine flotilla of trawlers was bombed continuouslyj throughout the day. One of the trawlers, H.M. Trawler Rutlandshire, was sunk,I .iler crew were saved. H.M.S. Nubian was detached to provide anti-aircraft[assistance in this area.j     -H-M-S. Carlisle was bombed off Aandalsnes, and a near miss caused leaks inlpe condenser.

The Flag Officer commanding 20th Cruiser Squadron in H.M.S. Carliskestablished contact with the Norwegian Government and His MajestyKing Haakon.The Polish destroyer Groin- reported that she was missed by a torpedo 86 miles north-east of the Shetlands.April 21.5. Admiral of the Fleet the Earl of Cork and Orrery was placed in command of all forces in the Narvik area.Heavy air bombardment of Namsos continued, the town being almost completely destroyed and the pier badly damaged. Most of the French supplies and ammunition were destroyed, and General Audet requested that no more menor material should be landed owing to the severity of air attacks and the lack of anti-aircraft equipment. H.M. Ships Nubian and Auckland remained as anti-aircraft guardships during the day.Mine laying by a German aircraft in Namsos Fjord was reported, but thishas not been confirmed.S.S. Cedar Bank (5,160 tons), in convoy with two other supply ships andescorted by two destroyers, was torpedoed and sunk 60 miles north-west of the entrance to Aalesund. She was loaded with motor transport and ammunition.The remainder of the convoy reached Aandalsnes at dusk and completed dis-embarkation of troops and stores during the night. In the Narvik area therailway bridge east, of Narvik town was demolished and two destroyers werestationed on patrol to stop all boat communication and prevent repairs to the&apos;bridge. Two destroyers established a patrol in Trondheim-Leden to preventenemy supplies reaching the town. H.M.S. Curacao relieved H.M.S. Carlisle asguardship at Aandalsnes.April 22.6. In the Narvik area H.M.S. Furious reported that enemy parachutereinforcements were arriving at regular intervals.H.M.S. Resolution and five destroyers left the Clyde with the remainder ofthe Narvik base staff.In the Namsos area General de Wiart reported that his troops had beenshelled by a destroyer in the Verdal sector. The French transport Ville d&apos;Algerentered Namsos at dusk and disembarked troops and stores into H.M. ShipsAuckland and Maori during the night. No guns were disembarked as theVille d&apos;Alger was too large to go alongside. S.S. Blackheath with motor transport also arrived at Namsos and commenced unloading.H.M. Ships Flamingo and Bittern were ordered to operate at Namsos andAandalsnes until anti-aircraft defences are installed. H.M.S. Nubian, which left Namsos with survivors from HM. Trawler Rutlandshire, was bombedunsuccessfully at 0800.H.M.S. Calcutta (A/A cruiser) remained in the Namsos area with H.M.S.Auckland, which received minor damage but no casualties, after having been bombed 47 times between 1620 and 1800.H.M.S. Curacao reported that continuous enemy air attacks had taken placeon Aandalsnes, but the jetty had not been nit. The railway betweenAandalsnes and Dombaas was cut in several places by German bombers andwould take 12 hours to repair.H.M.S. Arethusa landed the R.A.F. base staff with 45 tons of petrol atAandalsnes during the night and sailed for Scapa with the Norwegian Director ofShipping on board.. H.M. Ships Javelin, Jackal, Pelican, Fleetwood, Ashanti and Arethusa allreported being shadowed or attacked from the air. H.M.S, Pelican, carryingport base staff for Aandalsnes, was hit by two bombs aft when north-west ofAalesund. Her engines were put out of action and she had 70 casualties. the base staff were transferred, and subsequently landed at Molde on the 23rd.HM.S. Pelican was taken in tow by H.M.S. Fleetwood.TJ-Boats were reported off Namsen Fjord, Hardanger Fjord, Trondhjem;Sogne Fjord and Bergen.April 23.7.   Heavy snowstorms impeded operations in the Narvik area.A convoy of ships with stores and material reached Vaags Fjord.
The Flag Officer Commanding Battle Cruiser Squadron in H.M.S. Warspitestimated that the Germans had lost 11 warships, not including one submarine,&apos;m ^Tbif aircraft carriers Ark Royal and Glorious, escorted by II.M. Shipknerwick and Curlew, sailed to operate off the Norwegian coast to provide airDDort to the military forces ashore. There was no bombing in the Namsos area the 23rd owing to adverse weather conditions. S.S. Blackheath continued^loading at Namsos, and the Flag Officer 2nd Cruiser Squadron withHM Ships Glasgow, Sheffield, Galatea and six destroyers landed 2,000 troops at Molde and Aandalsnes during the night.Owing to shortage of fuel the destroyers patrolling off Trondheim were forced to return to Scapa.   Four others were ordered to take their place.Three large French destroyers carried out a sweep in the Skagerrak to attackenemy anti-submarine vessels and patrols. One enemy trawler was sunk andanother severely damaged. A coastal torpedo boat was also hit. The destroyers were attacked by enemy aircraft on three occasions early on the 24th but received no damage.2ith April.8. S.S. Blackheath with H.M.S. Maori completed unloading at Namsos.Nine and a half tons of A.A. guns and tractors were landed, but were founddifficult to move, due to the state of the roads.H.M.S. Curacao was damaged by bombs at Aandalsnes and reported50 casualties. She returned to Scapa under escort.H.M.S. Galatea was unsuccessfully bombed north-east of the Shetlands, andan abortive raid was carried out on Scapa during the evening.German Minelaying in Norwegian Waters.9. Information has been received from various sources that enemy mines have been laid off the Norwegian Coast as follows :  :(a) Off Namsos.(b) In Kraakvaag Fjord, the seaward end of one of the northern approaches to Trondheim.(c) Magnetic mines in Harhams Fjord, one of the comparatively shallowentrances of Molde Fjord, leading to Molde and Andalsnes(d) Outside the British declared area of Stadlandet.(e) Off the entrance to Sogne Fjord.(/) In two of the seaward northern entrances of the fjord to Bergen.(g) At the junction of two fjords above Bergen.(A) Minelaying was suspected off Hardanger Fjord.The position of the Navies in the Scandinavian States.10. By the German invasion of Denmark and Norway a number of warshipsbelonging to these States have fallen into German hands. In Denmark theGerman navy may be presumed to have acquired one old cruiser, six torpedo boats and ten submarines, of which four are modern. In addition, Denmarkpossessed seven minesweepers, including one modern ship, and six old minelayingcraft. There were three submarines completing in Denmark at the time of the invasion.The position with regard to the Norwegian Navy is more complicated. the coastal defence ships Eidsvold and Norge are believed to have been sunk at narvik, and the Aegir at Stavanger. The minelayer Olaf Tryggvason and thesubmarine B 2 are reported as having been sunk at Oslo. The Germans arepresumed to have captured two old coast defence ships, the minelayer Rauma,the submarine B 3, and five torpedo boats, mostly at Horten naval station nearOslo. The torpedo boats Sild, Sleipner, Trygg, Oraug and Ilyscor are co-operating with the Allies, and three more vessels, including a submarine, areavailable. There are still some four more surface units and a submarine atpresent unaccounted for.The latest information of the Swedish navy confirms the reports that it is concentrated in the Stockholm area.[21198] b 2
Home Waters.11. H.M.S. Suffolk, which was hit on the quarter-deck by two bombs on th17th April, has been beached at Scapa. &apos;fH.M. Submarine Seal was missed by a torpedo 140 miles east of AbprHson the 18th April. &apos; eenH.M. Submarine Truant reported two explosions, probably maoneti-torpedoes, on the 25th April when to the eastward of Aberdeen. She sustainedvery slight damage and is now at rosyth.H.M. Submarine Tarpon is overdue and must be considered lost.Casualties.12. Casualties sustained during- the week&apos;s operations are shown inAppendix IV.British Minelaying.13. During the past week aircraft have continued dropping mines in thesouthern half of the Baltic and in the approaches to North Sea ports. In general it may now be assumed that the channels leading up to all the German main portshave either been wholly or partially mined.Protection of Seaborne Trade.14. In the week ended noon, Wednesday, the 24th April, the number ofvessels in British convoys was : British     .................. 558Allied      .........      ......... 56Neutral    .................. 43Total    ............... 657The British S.S. Hawriby (5.380 tons) was mined and sunk in the thames estuary on passage from the Tyne while in convoy.Fifty ships (including 7 neutrals) arrived from Gibraltar, 34 from westAtlantic ports and 40 from Sierra Leone.Shipping on the East Coast has been held up at times during the week, dueto the suspected presence of enemy mines, and this fact in large measure accounts for the reduction in numbers of ships convoyed as compared with the previousweek. Twenty-six destroyers (including four French) and 12 sloops were employed on escort duties, and two battleships and 4 armed merchant cruisersas ocean escorts.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy amounted to 888,509 tons,18 tankers brought 185,582 tons of oil and spirit, of which 31,900 tons&apos; went toFrance.  Cereals totalled 164,193 tons and ore 286,237 tons.Since the commencement of hostilities the total number of ships convoyedhas been : British................       14,568Allied.................. 979Neutrals     .-...............        2,856Total        ...      ...    , ...      ...      18,403Of these 26 British, I Allied and 3 neutral vessels have been sunk : an averageof one in 613.  The neutral losses average one in 952.From the 9th April inclusive, Norwegian ships sailing in convoy are dealtwith as Allied vessels. ,German Minelaying.15. In addition to the minelaying reported on the Norwegian coast, therehas been considerable minelaying activity by enemy aircraft, principally duringthe three nights 17th-18th April, 20th-21st April and 22nd-23rd April over tne
Thames Estuary and Downs. Aircraft were also plotted up the East Coast asfar north as Whitby and the South Coast between Dungeness and Beachy Head.In several places parachute mines were seen to drop.Traffic through the Downs was stopped immediately after the three above-mentioned raids, but channels were opened up wherever possible during thefollowing day. Degaussed ships were allowed to proceed within a few hoursof the raids and the remaining ships after LL sweepers had swept ahead.Traffic in the Thames, Humber and at Harwich has also been held up during theweek.British Minesweeping.16. LL sweeps and skids have each accounted for 6 mines in the Downsduring the week. A channel one mile wide has been cleared from the north endof the Barrow Deep to the Sunk Light Vessel in the Thames Estuary. Thischannel requires to be buoyed before being established. Three mines, presumablylaid during the raids on the night of the 22nd-23rd April, have been explodedclose outside the Humber by LL sweeps.Skids and LL sweeps have exploded one mine each in the area outside theEiver Eibble. A searched channel has been cleared from the river entrance toMorecambe Bay Light Vessel, thus opening the port of Preston which had been closed for ten days.The 5th Minesweeping Flotilla has been sweeping the suspected area west of the War Channel between the Tyne and Coquet Island, and nine mines havebeen cut or exploded.The total number of mines exploded to date are 331 moored mines and140 magnetic mines.Five pairs of LL trawlers and three LL tugs are operating in the thames estuary and the Downs. One pair of LL trawlers is operating at each of thefollowing ports, Scapa, Portsmouth, Swansea and Liverpool. The D.W.I. isoperating amongst the shipping in the Downs.Two groups of Oropesa Trawlers have been allocated for minesweeping workin Norway.Anti-Submarine Operations.17. At the beginning of the week under review a striking force of destroyerscarried out an extensive sweep into the North Sea through areas where U-boats were suspected to be operating but no contacts were made.Five attacks by aircraft and 9 by surface craft have been carried out.The French Submarine Orphee while returning to Harwich from patrolreported that she sighted two 700-ton U-boats on the surface and fired twotorpedoes.  Two explosions were heard.German attacks on Seaborne Trade.18. Five British ships (18,480 tons) and 1 Norwegian (1,458 tons) were sunk by enemy action. Two British ships were torpedoed; S.S. Swainby north of the Shetlands and S.S. Cedarbank off the Norwegian coast. Three british ships and 1 Norwegian were mined in the Thames Estuary (details are givenm Appendix I).The Italian S.S. Italo Balbo (5,114 tons) was bombed and machine-gunnedoff Deal, and the British S.S. Western P rince (10,926 tons) was machine-gunnedby enemy aircraft while at anchor in the Thames Estuary on the 20th April,but no serious damage has been reported. An East Coast convoy was alsounsuccessfully attacked the same evening.Casualties to German Merchant Shipping.19. Confirmation has now been received that the German ship Rio deJaneiro 5,260 tons, was sunk by the Polish submarine Orzel on the 8th instanteast of christians and.H.M. Submarine Triad confirms having sunk a German steamer of 4,100 tons.  ^tn instant and having obtained one certain hit on a convoY on the^th instant.oa Submarine Swordfish reports having unsuccessfully attacked a convoy-Smiles south of Oslo Fjord.    .
H.M. Submarine Shark reports having unsuccessfully attacked two merchant ships escorted by the German Gunnery Training vessel Brummer on the15th April.The following German ships were at Narvik on the 9th April previous tothe raid by the 2nd destroyer Flotilla on the 10th :  Tons.Jan Wellem (Oil Refinery)......       ...       11,776Neuenfels      ...     &apos; ...       ...       ......        8,096Aachen...............        6,388Altona ...............        5,892Hein Hoyer   ...       ...       ...       ...       ...        5,836Bockenheim   ... ......       ...        4,902Martin Eendrick Fisser    ...       ...       ...        4,879Frielinghaus ...       ...       ...       ...      ^__..4,339Most or all of these ships are probably sunk.Assuming the tonnage sunk by H.M. Submarines between 13th and 15thto be about 30,000, it may safely be computed that the German Mercantile lossessince 1st April exceed 150,000 tons, made up as follows : By Captures = 10,000 tons.Sunk or Scuttled = 142.000 tons.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.20.   The 42nd Division is now in France.The 154th Infantry Brigade Group of the 51st Division has relieved the144th Infantry Brigade Group on the Saar.The 44th Division is taking over the sector previously held by 51st Division.Portions of the 12th and 23rd Divisions have landed in France to assist in workon the lines of communication and back areas.21. Between the Mosei and the Warndt Forest there were a number of minor engagements and raids, two being supported by artillery. Between theVosges and&apos; the Rhine there were some local raids and weak reconnaissances. In&apos; these engagements the enemy were repulsed with losses.Enemy artillery was again active in the area between the rivers Mosel andNied. On the Rhine enemy propaganda reassumed the form of leaflets fired frommortars.Germany.22. No important troop movements, apart from those to the Baltic coast,have been reported.No indications have been received of movements to the south-east frontieri of Germany.The distribution of German divisions up to and including the 24th April isbelieved to be as follows : Area.	Cav.	Armd. 7 1	Lt. -  4	Mot.	Inf. Min.   91 Max. 107 Max.   25 Min.    10 Max.     6 Min.     5 9 19 5 6 1	Totals.

One of the light divisions may be in Scandinavia. The three S.S. and Policedivisions are included among the motorised divisions in the west.23. The number of temporary bridges over the Rhine has fallen to eight&apos;and none are visible between Bonn and the Dutch frontier. Ample bridgingmaterial must, however, be available on the Lower Rhine from dismantled pontoonbridges, dumps and rafts.Some bridging over the Saar has been observed, but the number and positionof bridges over that river are constantly changing and no special significanceis attached to this activity.Northern Front.Narvik Area.24. General Mackesy has moved the bulk of his force from Haastad to thearea Bogen-Skaanland, where Admiral Lord Cork and Orrery has assumedcommand of the combined naval and military forces. Active operations have beenhindered by bad weather.The German force in Narvik, which probably does not exceed 3,000, hasreceived food and medical comforts by rail from Sweden. It seems likely that thesuccessful defence of Narvik will become a matter of prestige for the Germannation. 9flamsos-Trondhjem-A andalsnes A rea.25. North of Trondhjem General Carton de Wiart is in command of the146th Infantry Brigade and a demi-brigade of General Audefs Chasseurs-Alpins. The 146th Infantry Brigade was the first to land at Namsos and pushedrapidly forward to the Steinkjaer area, three companies penetrating as far south as Vaerdalen. Heavy air attacks on the 20th April, however, destroyed the town of Namsos and damaged the jetty, and another air attack reduced Steinkjaerto ruins. On the 21st a German force was landed from warships at the headof Steinkjaer Fjord and in the rear of the 146th Brigade, whose position becamevery precarious. Further, owing to deep snow our troops could not operate offthe roads, whereas some at least of the enemy were equipped with snowshoes.The withdrawal of our forces by the Steinkjaer-Namsos road was ordered, and carried out successfully on the 22nd April. The situation is now stabilised andour troops are digging in at Meieri, about 20 miles south of Bangsund. the chasseurs-Alpins are still in the Namsos area and have not yet been engaged.German action in this area appears to be designed to ensure the security ofTrondhjem until reinforcements arrive. German troops are digging in north ofSteinkjaer to counter any threat from the Allies in the north, and have alsoseized positions south of Trondhjem. They are being reinforced by air and tosome extent by sea.26. South of Trondhjem the first echelon of the 148th Infantry Brigadelanded at dusk on the 18th April at Aandalsnes, and was followed by theremainder of the Brigade two nights later. Troops at once pushed forward along the railway to Dombaas, and thence by road and rail to support the Norwegianforces about Lillehammer, where they arrived on the 20th April. Soon after-wards, in the face of increasing German pressure, the British and Norwegianforces were compelled to retire. On the 24th April they were about Otta, 20 miles south of Dombaas. &apos; .. .The first echelon of theT5th Infantry Brigade, which was recently withdrawnfrom France, arrived at Aandalsnes on the night of the 24th-25th April and was successfully disembarked. The remainder of the Brigade is due to land on the night of the 25th-26th. General Paget is also due to arrive on the night of the25th-28th April to take over command of the British forces in the southern sector.Both north and south of Trondhjem our, operations have been handicapped by lack of transport, artillery and A. A. protection. .Southern Area., 27. Information regarding events in southern Norway is still scanty. Themam German objective seems to be to&apos;effect a junction between the troops at Osloand those at Trondhjem.   To achieve this, they have strongly reinforced the
Italy.28. The active formations of the Italian army remain somewhat abovetheir combined war strength of about 1,000,000 men. At present nearly all themen with the colours are under 23, and one-third consist of new recruits with only one month&apos;s training. The equivalent of one complete class of reservistswould thus have to be called up to mobilise %he active army with trained men.Since last autumn, formations of the Italian army have been distributed attheir war stations for defensive purposes at home and overseas. The presentdistribution, excluding native troops in the colonies, is as follows : 20 divisions and equivalent of about divisions of Frontier Guard.4  divisions  and  equivalent of about1 division Frontier Guard.12 divisions and equivalent of about divisions of Frontier Guard.8 divisions.8 divisions.3 divisions.2 divisions.3 divisions,5 divisions.1 division and equivalent of about 1division miscellaneous troops.4 divisions and equivalent of about halfa division Frontier Guard.8  divisions  and equivalent of about1 division Frontier Guard.1 white division and equivalent of about divisions miscellaneous white troops(Blackshirts).No important moves of formations would, therefore, be necessary for defensive purposes.The Balkan States and Turkey.29. Despite rumours during the past fortnight of possible offensive action by Italy, the General Staffs of Yugoslavia and Greece do not appear to havebeen perturbed. In Yugoslavia some 50,000 men were called to the colours,raising the total strength of the army to about 250,000, and reinforcing the garrisons on the Dalmatian coast and near the Albanian frontier, but not onthe Italian frontier. In Greece it appears that no special precautionary measures have been taken.French and Swiss FrontierGerman Frontier ...Yugoslav FrontierItaly interior : Northern ItalyCentral Italy   ...Southern Italy ...SardiniaSicilyAlbaniaDodecaneseLibya : CirenaicaTripolitaniaItalian East Africatroops in the Oslo area and advanced northwards along two main valleys, theGudbransdale and the-Osterdal. Fighting was at first carried out by smaijbodies of troops, reinforced by armoured cars, A.F.Vs. and artillery. Strongerbodies are, however, now being employed. So far as it is possible to judge, thesesmall units pushed ahead, regardless of their Hanks and relying on their speed and daring to overcome difficulties. As in Poland, their operations have had theadvantage of strong air support; machine-gunning and bombing of ground troops and communications is frequent. .     ,Coincident with the advance of their forces northwards, the Germans havereinforced Stavanger and Bergen and have succeeded in pushing some distanceinland from these places. It is thought probable that units from the german forces at Oslo may endeavour to effect a junction with the forces at Bergen assoon as the Oslo-Bergen railway and the roads south of it are available formovement.
Royal Air Force Operations.Bomber Command.30. Conditions during the week have not been very favourable for daybombing, and several raids planned have been abandoned as a result of theabsence of cloud cover. Night bombing and night reconnaissance have, however,been fully maintained, and there have been numerous attacks on the air basesemployed by the enemy for the conduct of the Scandinavian campaign.raids  were directed against the Oslo aerodromes and shipping in the oslo fjord on the nights of the 18fh-19th, 22nd-23rd and 23rd-24th April. Twoof these attacks were successful in reaching the aerodrome at Fornebu and oneattack reached the aerodrome at Kjeller. A fire was seen to start at Fornebu,and two ships of about 1,500 tons were bombed in the Oslo Fjord, one shipapparently suffering damage. Four attempts, on the nights 18th-19th, 20th-21st,22nd-23rd and 23rd-24th, have been made to repeat the raid of the 16th-l7thApril on Trondheim aerodrome, but these have been unsuccessful owing toadverse local weather conditions. The aerodrome at Kristiansand (South) was successfully attacked on the night of the 20th-21st April.Stavanger was attacked on the nights of the 20th-21st and 21st-22nd april and early in the morning of the 24th April. The anti-aircraft defences appearto have been strengthened; a balloon barrage was put up after one of the attacks, and searchlights have made the observation of results somewhat moredifficult. Bombs were, however, seen to drop on the runways, and among theparked aircraft, and numerous fires have been started. At least eight andprobably more enemy aircraft were destroyed. Only one aircraft has failedto return; it was seen to be under attack by two Messerschmitt 110&apos;s and is assumed to have been shot down. Aalborg was raided on the night of the20th-21st April, and again on the 21st-22nd, 22nd-23rd and 23rd-24th April.The damage to parked aircraft was hard to estimate, but numerous explosionsand fires were seen, and hits were made on a hangar. Opposition here also was at first negligible but has been steadily intensified; three aircraft are missing out of twenty-four in all engaged. The aerodromes at Westerland, onSylt, which has also been used as a base for Scandinavian operations, was attacked by twelve heavy bombers on the 23-24th April, which secured hits on the runwaysand started several fires; some Messerschmitt 110&apos;s were seen in the air, but did not attack.   All our aircraft returned safely.31. Reconnaissances in force over German waters were carried out success-fully by twenty-four aircraft on the 20th-21st April, by thirty-six on the21st-22nd April, and by twenty-six on the 23rd-24th April; only one aircraft has not returned. As a result of enemy mine-laying actions off our coasts, offensive patrols against enemy seaplane bases were resumed in the night the 23rd-24thApril; on this occasion fire was opened on our aircraft by small enemy naval units, and it is believed that one large motor-boat and one anti-aircraft ship were sunk by bombs.One Blenheim took off in the early morning of the 25th April to carry out ameteorological reconnaissance of the Stavanger area. This aircraft attacked with bombs and machine-gun fire two Cornier 18. All bombs missed, but tracerbullets were seen to hit one of the enemy aircraft, smoke issuing from the engine.Coastal Command.,32- Extensive patrols were again maintained off the Norwegian coast, inaudition to the ordinary work of the Command. A total of nine enemy submarinesave been sighted at various times, five of which were attacked, without positiveesuj;ts;. The most promising attack was made on a 250-ton submarine, which &apos;crasn-dived when sighted 100 miles N.W. of Stavanger on the 20th April,coml-f^   Thirty-three enemy aircraft. were encountered, and there were seven imoats.  A Heinkel 111 was intercepted by Gladiators over the Shetlands on[21198] c

On the 23rd April a Heinkel float-plane was pursued by a Hudsonand appeared to be driven down on the water. On the 20th April a Dornier 18was seen floating upside down, on the sea 140 miles off the Norwegian coastEnemy fighters, both Messerschmitt 109 and Messerschmitt 110, were sighted on several occasions, but did not succeed in pressing home their attacks, except onthe 24th April, when two Messerschmitt 109s intercepted three Hudsons whichwere on escort duty with three destroyers off the South-West of Norway. Two ofthe Hudsons were hit in the engines and fell into the sea. Three Hudsonsencountered two Messerschmitt 109s in the same area later in the morning andwere attacked twelve times, without suffering serious damage.34. Reconnaissances of the harbours and fjords from Kristiansand (South)northwards produced much information in regard to the movements of merchantshipping, and many photographs were taken. Little opposition was encounteredexcept from scattered machine-gun fire. A successful reconnaissance was madeof the Trondheim area on the morning of the 22nd April; three troop-ships and seven seaplanes were seen moored off the town, and on a frozen lake nearby weretwelve Heinkel lll&apos;s, six Junker dive-bombers, and four troop-carrying aircraft.The aircraft were covered with snow and there was little sign of activity. Therewas only one aircraft at Vaernes, and a patch of water was seen on the surfaceof the aerodrome. Some anti-aircraft fire was experienced from Trondheim as our aircraft turned for home. A reconnaissance of Frederichshavn, in the north of Denmark, where the A admiral Scheer has been reported in a sinking condition,was carried out successfully on the night of the 20th-21st April, and reportedthat there was no warship in the harbour there.Following a reconnaissance of Bergen Fjord on the 19th and the 21st April,which had shown two large carefully camouflaged petrol tanks, with no buildings in the neighbourhood, a raid was made by four Hudsons on the 22nd April, with high-explosive and incendiary bombs, during which a hit was scored at the edge of one of the tanks, and this was followed by a large column of black smoke. Onemerchant ship was seen on fire in Bergen on the 19th April, and a ship was againseen on fire in a similar position on the 22nd April.On the 25th April a Norwegian 3-seater naval reconnaissance seaplane landed at Peterhead.Fighter Command.35. 228 patrols, involving 537 aircraft sorties, were flown during the week.No interceptions were made; one aircraft was claimed to have been destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. On the evening of the 24th April eighteen gladiators landedon the frozen lake at Lesgeskogen twenty-eight miles South-east of Andalesnes.British Air Forces in France.36. There were numerous combats during the week in the Advanced air striking Force sector in particular on the 20th, 21st and the 23rd April; twoHienkel Ills, five Messerschmitt 109s and three Messerschmitt 110s were shot down and three Messerschmitt 109s and three Messerschmitt 110s were damaged and possibly destroyed. Two of our pilots were wounded by enemy fire, andsuccessfully forced-landed; one of our aircraft was shot down, &quot;the pilot escapingby parachute, and one was damaged but made a good landing.36a. Extensive night reconnaissances were flown by aircraft of the AdvancedAir Striking Force on the - nights of the 20th/21st, 21st/22nd, and the22nd/23rd April, over the Rhineland towns and waterways, and numerous leafletsdropped. There were in all 67 aircraft sorties, and all aircraft but one returned safely; searchlight and anti-aircraft opposition was not severe, and the fewenemy fighters which were seen did not press home an attack. Little unusualtraffic movement was observed.Reconnaissances over north-western Germany were also provided by single aircraft of the Air Component on the nights of the 19th /20th and the22nd/23rd April, and returned safely without having observed anything oiparticular interest.
French Air Force Operations.37 There have been extensive reconnaissance nights throughout the week,the Siegfried Line, the Rhine front and beyond.   Night reconnaissance has(Ten carried^as far as the Dutch-German frontier, Munich and Western Bohemia.One Henschel 126 (Army Co-operation aircraft), one Messerschmitt 109, andone Junker 88 have been destroyed in combat; one Dornier 17 escaped across the rhine on one engine on the 19th April, and another was compelled to make aforced landing in Belgium on the 22nd April.AIR INTELLIGENCE.German Air Operations.38. In spite of the Scandinavian campaign, there has been considerableactivity on the Western Front, particularly at night; German aircraft have been over Paris more than once at night, and have penetrated as far as Bordeaux,Limoges and the Channel ports. Considerable attention has been paid to the franco-Belgian frontier. During these operations, three bombers, one army co-operation aircraft and nine fighters were destroyed by the Allied air forces;one bomber and six fighters were damaged. In addition, one bomber was drivendown in Belgium, and another in Holland, while a third forced-landed inSwitzerland.39. Enemy activity over the North Sea has been mainly limited to reconnais-sance flights over North Scotland and the Orkneys and Shetlands. There was,however, considerable minelaying activity in the Humber, the Thames Estuaryand the Downs areas on the 20th and 22nd April; enemy aircraft were on several occasions held by searchlights and anti-aircraft guns were in action. Unsuc-cessful attacks on shipping were associated with these raids. Some twenty-seven aircraft were plotted in the Scapa Flow area on the evening of the 24th April,and had presumably set out to attack naval units there but this raid seems to havebeen abandoned partly owing to unfavourable weather and partly as a result of heavy anti-aircraft fire against those which located and attacked the base. only two or three aircraft reached the objective and six bombs were dropped, twoof which fell on Hoy and the.remainder apparently in the sea.40. No major change has taken place in the disposition of the German airforces in Norway during the week, but the bomber units K.G. 26 and K.G. 30have suffered considerable losses and have been reinforced by Staff els of K.G. 4and K.G. 100. Reconnaissance aircraft have been reinforced by the move of partof the High Command Reconnaissance Gruppe to Norway. It is probable that steps will be taken to reinforce the fighter units at Stavanger and Kristiansand(South), but no moves have yet been identified.41. Operations by the German Air Force in this theatre have been of thesame type as during the previous week. Reconnaissance by float-planes andnymg-boats has been maintained along the coast, attacks by heavy bombers anddive-bombers have been made on naval units and on lines of communication, andthe transport of troops by air has continued. It is estimated that about 300 air-craft, out of some 800 available, have been continuously employed on thistransport work during the last ten days. Since the 15th April Germany hassuspended a large number of continental air services, and has probably thusreleased about fifty aircraft for military use. This probably indicates an attemptto concentrate the maximum of effort as quickly as possible, rather than an actualsnortage of the necessary aircraft. At the same time there has been a largenumber of casualties among transport aircraft, and a report from an observerm Uslo indicates that the original landing there was made under great pressure,and regardless of loss of life; crashes were numerous.It is believed that it will be possible to operate heavy aircraft from the frozenakes for about another fortnight, unless a sudden thaw sets in.[21198] c 2
Holland.42 Various measures are reported to have been taken against surpriseattacks on the principal Dutch aerodromes. At Schiphol the grass is nowobstructed night and day by old cars and other vehicles, and additional obstruc-tions are placed on the runways at night. Military aircraft have been removed from the aerodrome at Ypenburg and stationed alongside the mam road betweenThe Hao-ue and Rotterdam. Hangars, aerodrome buildings and aircraft are recovered with camouflage netting. Elsewhere aircraft have been spaced out round the aerodrome boundary.Spain.43. It is estimated that out of the official first-line strength of the SpanishAir Force, only some 250 are fit to take the air at a given moment. At least halfof the 108 Russian aircraft shown as establishment are not assembled, and many others are without vital equipment, such as armament. At least half of theGerman and Italian aircraft on establishment are suffering from defective main-tenance and the absence of spare parts. For the Victory celebrations recently heldat Madrid, the Air Ministry made every effort to assemble as many aircraft aspossible, but were only able to muster about 200, consisting of 100 fighters,70 bombers and 30 trainers.
