The problem has already been considered by the Cnieisof Staff in their Report W.P. (40) 134 of the 21st April, and the present paper should be read in conjunction with that Report.2.   There seem to me three courses open to His Majesty&apos;s Government :-(1) To declare war.(2) To do nothing.(3) To take some intermediate action.3. It has proved difficult to devise any satisfactory action under (3). Forinstance, the proposal adopted by the Supreme Council that an Allied force should occupy Salonika looks like being discarded for various reasons. Another form of intermediate action would be to break off diplomatic relations with Italy andwithout declaring war to close the entrances to the Mediterranean to Italiancommerce. This would, however, be represented in Italy as a reimposition ofeconomic sanctions and as such would, besides rendering war almost inevitable,rally the Italian people to Mussolini&apos;s policy of war in a way that nothing elsecould. Moreover, such an indeterminate situation half peace and half war would, I should suppose, hamper us in every sphere by creating uncertainty as to how far we could take those measures which we would take automatically if war were declared. In the meantime Italy would enjoy all the advantages of theinitiative.4. It would seem, therefore, that the choice must lie between declaring waroutright or doing nothing.5. After weighing the various considerations as set forth in the attachedstatement, and taking into account the Report by the Chiefs of Staff,W-P. (40) 134 of the 21st April, I am at present disposed to feel that, subjectto the views of the French and Turkish Governments, we should, in the eventof an Italian attack on Yugoslavia, declare war oh Italy. We should do so evenlf Yugoslavia did not appeal to us for help, and even if she collapsed at the firstonslaught.H.foreign Office, April 29, 1940.H009   [21209]
Policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government if Italy attacks&apos;Yugoslavia.Arguments an Favour of our going to   Arguments against our going to war war.1. It will do something to restore our prestige in all parts of the world,especially in the Balkans, from thedamaging blow which it will receive ifwe remain inactive, especially after out failure in Norway.2. Even though we could not bring;any direct assistance to Yugoslavia, our intervention would put heart intoYugoslavia and all other Balkan States,preserve the Balkan bloc that may otherwise disintegrate, and to this extent render more difficult any attempt by Germany to overrun or overaweSouth-East Europe.1. We do not want to add to our enemies if we can help it, especiallyjust before we may have to face an overwhelming attack by Germany byland and air. We are already heavilycommitted in Scandinavia and facedwith the constant threat of german attack against the Western Front andthe United Kingdom., War with italy would necessarily cause further dis-persion of our strength which may wellbe Germany&apos;s strategic aim.2. We could not help Yugoslaviadirectly and would have to stand byhelpless and see her overrun.3. Once Italy is at war with Yugo-slavia, it is probable that, sooner or later, she will enter the war against us.It is better that we should not leave toItaly the choice of a possibly morefavourable moment.4. If Italy attacks Yugoslaviainstead of Great Britain and Francedirect, this fact would suggest that shewants for the moment, to avoid directwar with us probably because it wouldbe highly unpopular in Italy. This, initself, might be a reason why we shouldforce the issue.5. The longer we put off: going to warwith Italy the stronger she will become,owing to the stocks that she is accumu-lating and the reorganisation of herforces. -&apos; \ -6. Even though- at the present time:we should have to stand on the dei&apos;e.0-siye, the closing of the: three exits [to.the Mediterranean to Italy would have&quot;a serious effect on Italian morale and economy, and would cut Italy off at oncefrom Eritrea and Abyssinia.3. As long as peace is preserved with italy, there is always an offchance thatMussolini may quarrel with Hitlerover Hungary or Russia or somethingelse and that this may offer an oppor-tunity for us to come to terms with italy and to convert her into an im-partial neutral.4. While war against the allies would almost certainly be unpopular in italy, if our action in the war was limited to a blockade of Italy enforcedby closing the exits to the Mediter-ranean, it might well rally the Italianpeople to the regime as being a repetitive-tion of the &quot; sanctions &quot; of 1936. Ifwe were to declare war on Italy,Mussolini would try to reconcile theItalian people to the war by arguing that the Allies had picked a quarrelwith Italy and that the latter thereforewas fighting in self defence.5. If Italy is growing stronger withtime, so are the Allies.u; 6. Since we cannot take the offensive in Italy it is Italy who will seize theinitiative and take the offensive against us: by air and sea-this, fe,from restoring our prestige in neutral countries, -would damage, it stillfurther, especially if owing to our art
imments in Favour of our going to Arguments against our going to War.1 ;&quot;       --&apos;    War.&quot; -       &apos;- i&apos;-  .....7 By going to war with Italy weshould bring Turkey into the war andmight thus obtain access to the black sea which in its turn would enable usto stop oil shipments from Batoum via the Danube to Germany.8. With Italy at war we should beable to close a large leak in our contra-band control, and thus render the&quot; blockade &quot; of Germany more effective.9. Until we have knocked Italy out,or at any rate taken the measure of herforce to harm us in the Mediterranean,we shall presumably be gravely-hampered in any operations to help theTurks in the event of a German pushto the Mediterranean or theDardanelles.10. Italy might ultimately become amilitary liability to Germany, particu-larly in view of the unpreparedness ofher land and air forces and the vulnerability of her industrial areas and of the sea communications to herAfrican colonies. This in itself wouldbe a reason why we should want tobring Italy into the war.weakness she was able to secure somespectacular successes, e.g., against our shipping; or possibly, though lessprobably, Malta and Tunisia. Warwith Italy would also make our com-munications with Egypt very pre-carious, and create internal difficultiesin Egypt.7. Though Turkey would certainlyfulfil her Treaty obligations, it looksas though she would come in un-willingly because she would fear that war with Italy would soon involve herin war with Germany and possiblyRussia, and for this she is not readyyet.8. We should find it difficult to export all the oil which we have boughtin Roumania, with the result that itwould be bought by the Germans,(Owing to transport difficulties theymight, however, find it difficult to get it to Germany for some time.) As weshould find it difficult to obtain supplies from Roumania and Persia through theMediterranean, we should have to make them good from American sources, thusinvolving dollar payments.9. Our shipping would have to be diverted from the Mediterranean andthe Red Sea : this would mean farlonger journeys and a correspondinglyincreased strain on our shipping re-quirements and troop movements. Weshould only be able to maintain ourcontact with the Balkan countries and turkey by using long circuitous and in-convenient routes.10. Italy might succeed in draggingSpain into the war against us or atleast in obtaining valuable naval andair bases in the Balearic Islands and spanish ports. With Spain as ourenemy, we must face the loss of our iron ore and other supplies from Spain, andthe probability of Gibraltar being un-serviceable  is  1 base. We might also have to assist Portugal, who would demand our protection against aSpanish invasion. The route to the cape would also be exposed to air attack and an increased scale of submarine attack.Foreign Of/ice, April 29, 1940.
