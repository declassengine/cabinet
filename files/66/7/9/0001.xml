secret copy No.  w OW.P. (40) 12913&amp; April, 1940TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINETDISTRIBUTION OF THE FORCES IN africa memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. On 15th January, 1940, the War Cabinet considered the review by theChiefs of Staff of Military Policy in the Middle East. The Chiefs of Staff estimatedthat in the event of Italian hostility, the King&apos;s African Rifles (10 battalions with supporting units) and one brigade of the Royal West African Frontier Force (fourbattalions with supporting units), would be sufficient for the defence of EastAfrica (W.P. (39) 148, paragraph 32 of Annex). The War Cabinet decided, partly on account of the Italian situation and partly on account of the unsuitability of west African troops for operations in some of the possible Middle East theatres of war, to postpone the move of a brigade of the Royal West African frontier force to Kenya.*2. A report has now been received from the Commander-in-Chief, middle east, in which he makes recommendations as to the distribution of the forces under his command in Africa. He estimates that the minimum requirements of east Africa are : For external defence       ...      ...     9 battalions with supporting units.For internal security      ...      ...     4 battalions.Total      ...       ...   13 battalions with supporting units.In addition he considers that a reserve of 3 battalions would be very desirable,making a total of 16 battalions. The General Staff agree with this estimate,which does not differ materially from that previously made by the Chiefs ofStaff.3. Towards these requirements there are at present in East Africa a total of10 battalions (omitting 1 about to sail for British Somaliland), but it is desired toearmark certain of these for service outside East Africa, viz : (a) 3 battalions (with supporting units) for the defence of the Anglo-Iranianoilfields against Russia.(b) 1 battalion (additional to that mentioned above) to reinforce british somali land in case of Italian hostility.Until India can provide a complete division for the Iran oilfields, an AfricanBrigade must be regarded as part of our first insurance against this contingency.The additional battalion for Somaliland would bring the forces there up tothe minimum necessary for an active defence against Italy.Thus, deducting the forces required for outside commitments, East Africa has at present 4 battalions for internal security and only 2 battalions (with certainsupporting units) for external defence. In effect, unless reinforced, East Africawould have to retain the 4 battalions which we require for our security in* W.M. (40) 14th Conclusions, Minute printed, for the War Cabinet, Apvu, 1940
Somaliland and the Anglo-Iranian oilfields, and even so would be 3 battalions short of the minimum necessarj^ for its own defence. The following reinforcements aretherefore needed : Minimum requirements    ...      ...   7 battalions.Additional as a reserve    ...      ...   3 battalions.4. Possible sources of reinforcement for East Africa are South Africa and west Africa, and, in order to avoid shipping difficulties, and the possibility of the denial of the port of Mombasa to us by enemy air and -naval action, reinforce-ments should be sent before an emergency arises. Neither South Africa norWest Africa could assume direct responsibility for East Africa&apos;s outside commit-ments, the former for political and the latter for geographical reasons. forces to cover these liabilities must therefore be held in East Africa.5. The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, recently visited Cape Town, and,as a result of his discussions with General Smuts, the South African Governmenthave renewed their offer of a military and air contingent for service in East Africa.The military force would consist of a Brigade of 3 battalions with supportingunits. This contingent, however, would not be ready to sail until the end of June.In West Africa 6 battalions, with supporting units, are at 21 days&apos; notice to move to East Africa in accordance with the arrangements made in peace-time. TheCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, recommends the employment of West african troops in East Africa. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has agreed to theirtransfer and feels that their morale may well suffer if they are held at notice fora further indefinite period. The date at which these troops could move depends upon the shipping situation.6. I recommend, therefore, that East Africa&apos;s minimum requirements inreinforcements should be partially met by the transfer, as soon as shipping is available, of 6 battalions, with supporting units, from West Africa; the arrival ofthe South African contingent will then complete minimum requirements and leave a reserve of two battalions.O.F.G.S.The War Office,13^ April, 1940(b40/8)   60   4/40   W-O.P.   5089
