Printed for the War Cabinet.  April 1940.secret.P. (W) wo.AVril 29, 1940.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.Copy No.WAR CABINET.THE BALKAN FRONT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affaires.I CIRCULATE herewith a memorandum on the Balkan Front and would suggest, if my colleagues agree, that the Chiefs of Staff should be asked toconsider urgently the question whether we shall, within the next few months,be able effectively to deny the Straits to Germany.Ff.April 29, 1940.THE BALKAN FRONT.UP till now we have with a fair amount of success been able to constituteand maintain a front in the Balkans in opposition to German pressure andpenetration. Based on Turkey this front has included Yugoslavia, Roumania,Bulgaria and Greece, with Hungary as a weakly-held outpost. Bulgaria hasaiways been a weak point in the line, but even here we have succeeded in recent months in definitely strengthening our position.      .All this has been accomplished by persistent diplomatic effort and carefulpropaganda and nothing much else. It is true that the existence of the Alliediorces in the Middle East has had a reassuring effect on Balkan public opinionup to a certain point. But we have never been able to reinforce our diplomacyby promises of military assistance (except in the case of Turkey). Indeed, wenave often had to refuse the war material for which the Balkan GovernmentsMvfrn^6^&apos; an(* ^ ^as keen ODViQUS to a*l tnat in sPite 0^ tne Allied forces in theMiddle East we could not bring any direct military assistance to those Statesimmediately exposed to German aggression. Our assistance was bound to beeke^n^&apos;        *S t0 Sa^&apos;     ^ ^n OUI&quot; caPaci^ty to and to defeat Germany-    rP till now it must be acknowledged that we have been helped by Germany&apos;smactrvity and we have done all \^e could- and not unsuccessfully to make fulljjvi    .y s period of inaction, but we must take it that this period is now over.1   r did not want a winter campaign in the Balkans; the winter is now past.U008   [21207]
He had to come to terms with the Italians and Russians before embarking mi-a Balkan campaign, and this he has probably now done.  Lastly, in order to fin?the, war this summer, as he has undertaken to do, he now requires to deliyimmediate and far-reaching blows in as many directions as possible, so as fdisperse our efforts and confuse our plans. 0If, therefore, Hitler invades the Balkans, it is hardly likely that he willcontent himself with the acquisition of the Roumanian oil wells. He will want to strike a direct blow at the Allies, and to do this he must push down to theMediterranean, and above all to the Straits. Thus, his objective would beConstantinople, and to a lesser degree Salonica.We must face the fact that, notwithstanding all our diplomatic effortsduring the winter, a German attack on the Balkans in the circumstances as they exist to-day would bring the whole edifice of Balkan solidarity which we solaboriously built up crashing to the ground like a house of cards. One or other of the Governments might offer a short resistance, but Germany&apos;s mastery ofthe air would enable the German Air Force to bomb them into speedy submissionas they bombed Poland last September and now are bombing Norway.The time has therefore come for us to consider very carefully, and taking into account all the facts, whether there is any point in South-Eastern Europewhere the Allies, in conjunction with the Turks, can make a stand.The Chiefs of Staff have told us that, owing to Germany&apos;s mastery of theair and other reasons, we cannot hope to hold Salonica, even as a defensive base.Is the same true of the Turkish lines in Thrace ?It is of the utmost importance that the Foreign Office should know what theprospects here are, since the whole of our policy in the Mediterranean and theNear East may depend on whether we can or cannot attempt in the near future to deny the Straits to Germany (or Russia).There can, of course, be no question of repeating the Norwegian campaign onthe plains of Thrace. It may well be that the conditions in Thrace would be evenmore unfavourable to us than they have been in Norway. The German air masterywould be as great, indeed it might be greater, for our troops would be at a furtherdistance from British air bases than they were in Norway. Moreover, our linesof communication across the Mediterranean would be exposed to the concentratedattacks of the Italian fleet and air force.The Turks no doubt would fight and fight gallantly, but if we are not capableof withstanding German air attack, neither would they be, and in the long runthey might elect to abandon their European territory and concentrate their efforts in the defence of their Anatolian homeland, where Germany would have no interest in pursuing them. Paradoxical as it may seem, the Straits and evenConstantinople are of more vital interest to us than they are to the Turks. Forthem the possession of their European territory is largely a matter of prestige,whereas for us the control of the Straits by Germany would put in jeopardy our whole position in the Mediterranean and Near East.There have, of course, been recent staff conversations with the Turks at Aleppo,but did they go to the root of the problem as regards our capacity in the immediatefuture to help the Turks to hold the Thracian line ? In any case, since theAleppo conversations we have had our experience in Norway, and the probability of Italy entering the war has vastly increased. It is suggested, therefore, theChiefs of Staff should, in the light of these new factors, consider urgently thequestion whether we would be able effectively, and successfully to assist theTurks within the next few months to prevent Germans from reachingConstantinople and the Straits.Foreign Office, April 29, 1940.
