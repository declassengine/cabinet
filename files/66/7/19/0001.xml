The prime Minister has agreed with me that the attachedvery brief summary of a German book entitled &quot;Die See-Strategiedes Weltkrieges&quot; by Vice-Admiral A.D. Wolfgang We gene r mightbe of interest to the members of the War Cabinet.2.        I understand that the book was received by the ForeignOffice in May, 1939o     The book pointed to the possibility -(a) that Denmark and part of Norway might be seizedby the Germans in the event of war as a jumping offground j(b) that trade routes would then be attacked with all available naval and air power, working from suchshore bases as could be seized or held, or could beconcealed, and from supply ships;(c) that from Norway there might be a &quot;spring acrossthe North Sea to win a geographical position, e.g.the Shetlands (the door to the Atlantic)&quot;3.        The book appears0 however, to assume a more powerfulGerman Fleet than is now left to them.(Intdc)   H.Treasury Chambers, S.W*lo

England&apos;s task was to maintain her favourable strategic  &apos;position, i0e0 to defend the trade routes of the Atlantic.She need only take action when these were threatened.Germany should have adopted a strategic offensive toimprove existing conditions.The English Elect based on Scotland controlled thetrade routes of the world.The German Fleet in the Bight controlled nothing.The English position was worth attacking for it held theIcey to the riches of the world-     The German position was worth nothing.The English position was worth defending, for thatmeant victory,,      There was no sense in defending the Germanposition for it was worth nothing.Therefore English strategy was right and the Germanwas wrongoGermany had to hold the Baltic and this defensivestrategy became bound up with a defensive strategy in theNorth SeasThis defensive strategy should have evolved into an offensive strategy to improve the position as in the case ofthe land strategy of an attack through France to Brest.Only one trade route was in Germany&apos;s reach, Denmark-Sweden- Norway   through the Cattegat past the Shetlands to the atlantic.     This!, should have been her objective but theGeneral Staff thought otherwise.     They allowed the Danesto block the Belts and Sound and were even grateful,  as though the safety of the Baltic did not alone rest on theFleet.     As a result, England, under the guise of neutrality,got another trade route free without having even to use onetrawler&apos;.Germany&apos;s strategic offensive plan should have obtained the re-opening of the Belts, an agreement with Denmark regardingthe use of her waters and the control of the northern traderoute.     She could then begin to break the English blockade.She would then have the keys of the Baltic and could cover the Sound and Belts from the North.     As she would then control the northern trade route, she could bring pressure to boaron the Northern Powers a     The German Fleet in the Gattegatcould threaten the English position and aim at the Atlantic.The next step was the trade route Shetlands-Norway*England could disregard this,  as this trade route .was not so important to her0Germany had first to get to the Atlantic trade routes and then fight for them0A naval strategic plan of operation depends on the strategic geographical position, not on the strength ofthe Fleet.

The next step would he the southern part of Norway*which Germany would have to free from English control.It is an error to suppose that the States, who owing totheir geographical position fall between two Great Powers, wouldnot themselves feel the necessity for maintaining friendly relations with such a powerful entity as Germany,     We wouldunderestimate the ability of their statesmen if we thought they could not understand that Germany must make certainterms in waroprom Norway, the spring across the North Sea to win ageographical position, e0g0 the Shetlands (the door to the atlantic) followsc     This would have forced England to fight, aswhoever held the Atlantic door won the war at sea.The actions that would have ensued would have been underfavourable tactical conditions for Germany, i.e. not rar from her bases and in fairly restricted areas,     Germany would haveused air reconnaissance owing to the short distances and manylanding grounds on the coasts from Norway to Ems.     Theinitiative would lie in German handSo     These battles wouldhave been worth fighting as of real strategic importance.What is lost in battle, can be regained in battle;    whatis lost geographically can only be regained geographically.(Hence the German defensive strategy made even a victory inthe North Sea useless).The Naval Staff knew the value of Denmark but could notconvince the Foreign Office.     The Naval Staff never demandedthe re-opening of the Belts - they only saw the Cattegat asa continuation of the Bight and did not grasp its tacticalvalue.The lesson for the future is to prepare the positionneeded in war,  during days of peace.     If the Reich had donethat, there would have been a unified operational plan comprisingdiplomacy and military and naval strategy, i.e. a Unified SferPlan.Submarine warfare could only disturb the trade routes, itcould not win them.Had Germany believed in the strategic offensive, sAewould have taken the offensive through the Belts and byNovember, 1914 could have begun to go forward.     The twoFleets would then inevitably have met.     Germany would havecontrolled the strategic positiono     This offensive would havealtered the whole situation;      even Falkland might have become a victory as England could not have spared her battle-cruisers 6 in the last war military strategy controlled and tieddown naval strategy..     Hence the need for combined   strategyembracing both service so.     When England is the enemy the sea isthe most important a     As the way to Brest was barred, the wayto the North must be openedp     Seen from the heights of a

&quot;Unified&quot; strategy, the question of Denmark and norway becomes the &quot;burning point&quot; of the war.     Before its importance the political difficulties pale, as alsothe question of from where the Army was to take the men.In Norwegian and Danish waters the Fleet would nothave been so easy to observe and report on as in theBight.What effect would the possession of the Belts have hadon the Eastern front and on the war with Russia?   Alsoneutrals, seeing Germany attacking England from Norway,would not have obeyed England so slavishly.To defeat England at sea should have been the main objective with the breaking of the blockade as the first step.Decisive action, for which preponderant strength isnecessary, was always laid down as the main objective ofall operations - whereas the action was of secondaryimportance to the reason for which it was fought.     Suchdecisive action as a main objective is true in the case ofcoast defence onlyj    otherwise objective must bestrategical,German Fleet developed inferiority complex fromdefensive policy.     The policy of the future must be&quot;Either - Or&quot; i,e. Neck or Nothing.Even the fact that England was known to be suspicious of the German Norwegian pre-war cruises and to have sentships to the Norwegian coast early in the war, did not show the General Staff how to act.Though the General Staff realised the nervousnessinduced by Goronel and the &quot;Emden&quot; and &quot;Mowe&quot;- they didnot use this knowledge.     In these cases sea power was atwork on the ocean, tactical ships based on strategicpositions, even if these strategic positions were onlya couple of colliers.     And because this power was working,England had to use her strength to desiroy it6Continental politics are based on land power - worldpolitics on sea power.Naval strategy must be worked out in peace hand inhand with foreign policy.To show your love of peace at the expense of yourstrength is foolish - you only lose your seat at thecouncil table!There is no defence against a Sea Power; the only possible action is to fight for the trade routes.As regard the future - in spite of Germany&apos;s presentweakness, her officer corps must be imbued with a&quot;strategic will1 instead of mere defensive ideas.

In the war Belgium was overrun because &quot;what theArmy needed it must have&quot;.     At sea it was different.Even though Germany did not fully realise the importanceof Denmark still the advantages of the Cattegat were clear*Political difficulties were always in the way.Even though the Versailles Treaty has destroyed the strength of the Navy, its task is still the same -defence of Germany&apos;s foreign trade on the Atlantic.     EveryNavy (i.e. the Flag) follows trade.As long as the Navy does not forget the Atlantic,it will live be it ever so small.
