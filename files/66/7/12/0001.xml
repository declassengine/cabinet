It appears that General Gamolin still makes a clear distinction &quot;between the action to &quot;be taken in the event of aGerman invasion of Holland and Belgium and that of Hollandalone 0U. Under the first hypothesis, i.e. Belgium and Hollandtogether, the only difference of opinion is in respect of air action.     General Gamelin is reported to have said that theFrench Government had delegated the authority for putting theair plans into effect to the respective Commanders with tworeservations.;In the concluding paragraph of his report air marshal Barratt explains that he obtained from GeneralVuillenufn. an interpretation of what was meant &quot;by the term&quot;respective Commanders&quot;, namely Generals Gamelin and Vuilleminand the&quot; Air Officer commanding-in-Chief in respect, of attacks on the German columns and Generals Gamelin and Vuillemin andthe Chief of the Air Staff representing the British high command, in regard to military objectives in the Ruhr and elsewhere.5. Air Marshal Barratt further explains that he had some difficulty in obtaining a clear interpretation and the exactshade of meaning of the reservationsa As finally confirmedfry the Comite de Guerre, they are attached as an Appendix tq&quot;the report and read as followss-r11 (i)       That the two Commands should agree as to

nature of the objectives and their military importance in relation to theoperations envisagedo(ii)       That it is &quot;borne in mind that it is notin the French interests to initiate any action against factories or other objectives which would affect the civilian population and that on our two COMMANDSis placed the responsibility of talcingthe decision to retaliate at the appropriate moment&quot; 0 ^^srS^8&quot;6. We need have no quarrel with the first of theseprovisoso      The primary factor upon which the choice of objectives which have &quot;been considered has depended, whether in the Ruhr itself or to the Westward, has &quot;been their military importance in the operation concerned.7. The latter reservation,, howeve?,?, precludes ourinitial attacks being directed against anything other thanGerman columns on roadso      It would, in fact, prevent the attacks against the defiles west of the Rhine, which air marshal Barratt in consultation with General Georges, hadselected as objectives for the British bomber squadronsplaced in his support on the first night of a German invasion,8,&apos; It is plain from Air Marshal Barratt&apos;s report thatthis restriction was General Gamelin&apos;s intenti(an and he made it quite clear to the General that, until this reservationwas modified or withdrawn, we could not use our heavy bombers at all.     Even so, it was apparent that no argumentsAir Marshal Barratt could use would move General Gamexirifrom his determination to insist on this reservation untilGermany had taken the initiative in bombing similar objectives.In a previous telegraphed report on the same interview, air marshal Barratt reports that he &quot;was obsessed with a fear of attack on his own road and rail communications&quot;99e     We consider it cf the utmost inportance that theGermans should not &quot;be allowed, once more,  to seize theinitiative, and take the view that the Allies should do everything possible to upset the German plans by themselves taking the initiative at the right time,100   We are precluded by a decision of the War Cabinetfrom initiating air attack in advance of an actualinvasion,,     Nevertheless the action we have proposedby the heavy bomber   force  against military objectivesboth west of the Rhine and in the Ruhr itself,coupled with an attack on the advancing German columnsif delivered, immediately a Gippk^el- offensive develops.,might have k profo-unci:-&amp; feet on the progress and successOf the Gen-ail- advance0

11, On the other hand, if we refrain from attacking the-Jtno-st nrc-fi-tabXe objectives at this juncture, notonly shallwe again he surrendering the initiative toGermany in what may well be the decisive action of thewar, but we may seriously reduce the chances of thej-Allied armies reaching the advanced positions in belgium which General Gamelin himself agrees it is sovital they should attain,12. In the second hypothesis - that of a german invasion of Holland alone, the arguments we have adducedapply with even greater emphasis,,      In his report, air marshal Barratt states that General Gamelin whenquestioned &quot;was equivocal over the case of Holland&quot;.He insisted that in this situation French assistance inprinciple only had been agreed, and asked Air MarshalBarratt to represent the matter home &quot;so that theBritish War Cabinet could make definite proposals tothe French Government as to their joint action in thisrespect,&quot;13. The Chiefs of Staff have already made suchdefinite proposals.    In ,a, memcr andum dated 8th. April, 1940which was forwarded to the French High Command forconsideration, we urged that General Gamelin shouldmake his initial moves into Belgium the moment theGermans started an invasion of Holland, impressing the vital importanse of not waiting until theBelgian   attitude    is&apos;   ascertained   by negotiation.    In his reply dated 11th April, 1940, general gamelin expressed his concurrence with our views and stated that General Georges had been instructed tosettle with General Lord Gort, the execution of theSforward movement, &quot;with^ue reg^d^t.^..,jeJ^jagiatanoes&apos;/ at the time and to Belgium^ attitude&quot;,     From this itII selfms^^cT^ is again making( reservations as regards the action to be taken in this situation.     The words quoted can only be taken to mean that in certain circumstances, presumably if Belgiumattempted initially to maintain her neutrality, theAllied armies would not in fact advance into Belgiumif Holland alone were invaded.2k* - It Is, moreover, abundantly clear that theFrench attitude towards air action in this hypothesiswill be even more obdurate than in circumstances whereFrance herself is more directly and immediately threatened.The implications of the French attitude should be clearlyrealised.     At the present time, and until agreementwith the French High Command on this question of air policy is reached, we are only authorised, in the eventof invasion of Holland alone, to initiate bombing actionagainst the advancing German columns;    and we haveagreed that In the absence of complementary action on land, such attacks - while very costly in casualties -could not materially impede the advance of powerfulGerman forces opposed as they would be by only the weakarmy and defences of Holland.15* We have stated our view that, at&apos; the presenttime, a German invasion of Holland would be tantamount toopening up a new phase in the war, and would constituteaction which &quot;looks like being decisive&quot; and is a directthreat to our vital interests.     It is obvious, therefore,that in the event of such an invasion we\ should not shrinkfrom \\sing all we have got,.:,,.   Unless we a!re prepared totake the initiative at this time, we shall be puttingourselves at a grave strategical disadvantage on land

and laying ourselves open to an immensely increased air offensive when Germany is ready and thus &quot;be accepting a situation in which procrastination may have the mostserious, if not disastrous consequences -16. In the face of Air Marshal BarrattTs report,it is quite clear that we have nothing to gain &quot;by furtherarguments on the military level,      We therefore recommendthat the War Cabinet should represent the British view inthe strongest and most unequivocal terms to the FrenchGovernment.      In particular, we suggest that the FrenchGovernment-should be told that an invasion of Holland inthe present situation forms such a vital threat to thesecurity of this country that,  if they cannot agree to theoperations we propose, we shall be compelled to reserve to ourselves the right to take independent action.(Signed)      C.L.I, N2WALL.DUDLEY POUND.EDMUND IRONSIDEoRichmond Terrace, S.W.I.^The Chiefs of Staff have not yet had an opportunity of seeing thisMemorandum in its final form, andtherefore reserve the right to makeany minor amendments/

ANNEX r.Headquarters,British Air Forces, in France.Dated 15th April, 191+0.My dear C.A.S.With reference to my telephone conversationsof the lkth and 15th April, 19^4-0, and my signal Ae 1630dated 15th April, 19h0, I forward herewith a reporton the discussions held between General GAMELIN, GeneralVUILLEMIN and the Military Members of the Comite de guerre and myself.2. Just as I was leaving VUILLEMIN he told me thatthere was a full Meeting of the Comite de Guerre tomorrow morning when some of the points that I &quot;brought up might possibly be reviewed.     He said, however, that he did notthink there would be any alteration in the decision, withwhich he himself entirely agreed.(Signed)    A.So BARRATT.annex XI,

ANNEX II.HeadquarterssBritish Air Forces in France,15th Aprils 1940.REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN GENERAL GAMELINBMILITARY MEMBERS OF THE COMITE DE GUERRE ANDTHE .AIR OFFICER COMI&amp;&apos;JSrDIl\TG-IN-CHIEF, british air FORCES IN FRANCE 0&apos;1. With reference to Air Ministry letterS..46368/D. ofPlanss dated 13th April? 1940S the Air Officer Commanding-in-chief was requested by the Deputy Chief of the AirStaff to approach General Georges on the action proposed under Hypothesis &quot;B!,r if the Germans were to invade holland and/or Belgium^ in order to ascertain his opinion and explain the reasons under-lying the British intentions.-After further reference to the Deputy Chief of the AirStaff it was decided that it would be necessary tointerview General Gamelin on the same subject.2. At 19.00 hours on 14th April9 1940s the Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief called on General Georges and explained matters broadly as follows:-(i) That the British War Cabinet had decidedthat any action by Germany to invadeHolland and/or Belgium following on recent events in Scandinavia would constitute a decisive situation in which full Allied effort must necessarily be engaged.(ii) That the primary concern of initial operations in the air as well as on land would beto establish the Allied armies on a forward position in Belgium.(iii) That subject to the minimum of diversionthat might be unavoidable in the Scandinavianor north German theatre? it was intendedto use the full offensive strengths of theRoyal Air Force9 in the area of the enemyadvance in the Low Countries and in the districts east of the Rhine in rear of thatadvance through which its lines ofcommunication and supply must run.(iv) The British disposition would be as follows:-(a) Medium bombers would be employed againstthe German advance 3  as already arranged,,(b) A small proportion of heavy bomber squadrons would be employed at nightagainst the concentration areas and communications between the Rhine and

Dutch and Belgian frontierss objectivesI    for which had already been selected(I)  by the British and French Staffs.(c) The balance of available heavy attack would be directed against communicationsthrough the Ruhr and other importantinstallations in that vicinitys suchas the marshalling yards and oil refineries.3. It was explained that British heavy-bombers couldonly operate by night if heavy casualties were to be avoided and that day operations  by these types against enemy concentrations could only be justified in a situation of real emergency.      In night operations onlya limited strength of bombers could be employed againstthe military concentration areas so that the operations against the Ruhr itself constituted no diversion of strength from the primary aim, and in fact would9 bydamage and confusion contribute directly and importantlyto weakening the German advance.     The German war industries dependant on the Ruhr could be assailed more easily at the outset of the German invasion of the low countries than later on when they have established themselves and their A.defences-forward in holland and Belgium.      It was also certain that operations against-Jfch^R:uhjr&quot;&apos;^wcaild.^,draw-from..the battle frontnumbers of enemy fighters.4. General Georges appeared to appreciate the weight of these arguments but after asking a fewquestions made it clear that the real authority onthat matter of strategy would be General Gamelin whowas also a member of the French Comite de Guerre.5. At 2030 hours the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chiefvisited General Gamelin and put the same account ofthe decisions of the British War Cabinet and other reasons before him.      General Gamelin replied thatthe French policy had been discussed by the Comite de guerre on Saturday3 lvJJa^^^U2 19409 at 1500 hours andtheir decision conveyed to^THeBritish ambassador at 19.00 hours on the same day.     The Ministers9he saids had expressed themselves as generally inagreement with the British intentions.     They had infact actually decided to delegate the authority for putting these plans into effect to the High MilitaryCommands but subject to two provisos.(i) That there must be complete agreement as to the time and nature of the objectives and their military importance,between the respective Commanderso(ii) That any bombing ox^considerations  against areasj where civil&quot;&apos;an casualties might be expected!&apos;as a results should only be initiatedas a reply to similar action on theI   I part of the enemy.

60 The Air Officer Gomm&amp;commanding-in-Chief pointedout that condition (ii) was not only likely to postpone the attack on the Ruhr &quot;but also the promptattack on the German advance into the Low Countries9for which Allied plans were already c ompleted.He had in mind,, particularly,, the arrangement whereby German concentration areas and centres of communication between the Rhine and the dutch and Belgian frontiers were to be attackedimmediately infringement took place0      The attack of such objectives must inevitably involve civilian casualties and probably damage to industrialundertaking in towns involved,,     To with-holdthis attack until enemy bombing with similarresults had been experienced and confirmed would almost certainly negative the first night&apos;operations during which the enemy movement wouldbe at its most vulnerable..      It might even cost the Allies more than this should the enemy realiseand profit by this Allied hesitation,.      It againleft the initiative to him.7. General Gamelin pointed out the importanceof not precipitating enemy attack on industry9but the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief repliedthat the objectives already selected in our plan for delaying the German advance9 quite apartfrom the Ruhr,, could be represented by the enemy9if he felt so inclined, as an attack on industry.Furthermore9 he thought that Germany wouldattack -Allied industry immediately it suited her9and would not be deterred by any question ofprecedento      For these reasons he would deeplyregret any further surrendering of the initiative08. General Gamelin adhered to the FrenchMinisterial rulings but agreed to discuss the matter further with the Air Officer Commanding-in-chief the following mornings  together with GeneralVulllemin,, .9o The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief attended the Comite de Guerre (Military members only)presided over by General Gamelin9 at 1030 hourson 15th April5 1940.     He was asked to repeat thearguments he had made the day before in general gamelin&apos;s presence9 and this was done.

General Gamelin then handed the Air Officer commanding-in-Chief a copy of the^reply of the Comite de Guerre to theBritish Government.10.       As regards the attack of objectives between the rhine and the BELGIAN and DUTCH Frontiers.General Gamelin said that in view of the fact that we hadthe advantages of an unimpeded advance (air excluded) into belgium,  the cover provided by the prepared demolitions onthe Belgian lines of defence and the resistance of theBelgian troops, it was to our advantage not to 4nitiateair attacks on the German lines of communication,&quot; par^&quot;&quot;ticularly in view of the great superiority in strength ofthe German bombers compared to our own.      He also saidthat neutral opinion had to be considered.      The Air OfficerCommanding-in-Ghlef pointed out that if it suited theGermans to attempt to delay our land advance with theirbombers, they would inevitably do so and that they wouldnot.pay any attention to the causes of humanity or theopinion of America.      The only criterion would be whatsuited them.      He stressed that under these proposalsthere rtmsJiJaa-ja^xiQnsiderable delay between the^ receiptof information of German bombing attacks, tKe decisionto start bombing on our part and the carrying out ofthat- action.11.       As regards the attack on Marshalling Yards, PetrolRefineries, and Factories generally in the RUHR area.GenearaT Gamelin was strongly opposed to initiating&quot; the attack on this type of target.      General Vuilleminsupported General   Gamelin in this respect and pointed outthe 3 or 4/1 superiority of German Bomber forces compared to the French and British.      With the very small forcesat our disposal he considered it was a grave risk to start this form of bombing in view of what Germany could do to the French and British industries.      The Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief reiterated more than once the arguments that obtained in paragraph 3.      The Air Officer Commanuing-in-Chief further pointed out that the British government considered that a critical stage in the war had arrived,that the invasion of Denmark and Norway, to be followedby Holland and Belgium was a long view strategical plancarefully worked out by the German High Command aiming atthe destruction of the British Empire.     That if theGermans could establish bases for their air and submarinefleets in all these territories while we did nothing andwaited on events, the situation would become extremely serious if not critical.      The time had now come todecide to take the initiative in spite of our numericallyweaker forces and face facts and fight out the issue.    IfAnnex III.

we waited until Germany established herself hoping andImagining that she was not going to attack our vitalindustries we should be living in a &apos;fool&apos;s paradisef,because just as soon as it suited Germany to launch herattack against British and French industries she would do so, with the added advantage that with having taken the extra territory west of the Ruhr she would have afar greater depth of protection in front of her vitalarea and make it correspondingly more difficult for theAllies to attack this area.12.       The Air Officer Gommandlng-in-Ghief asked whatGeneral Gamelin would do if the Germans -(a) invaded Holland alone and bombarded Dutchtowns from the air.(b) if they advanced through Holland andBelgium,, combined with air attack.As, regards invasion of Holland alone, General Gamelinsaid that it was outside the terms of reference given bythe Comite de Guerre.     He asked the Air OfficerCommanding-in-Ghief to represent the matter home so thatthe British War Cabinet could moke definite proposals tothe French Government- as to their joint action in this event.      The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief said that hethought this had already been done and he knew thatcertain plans ahd been laid down for Bomber Command.   he also said that General Vuillemin had recently made certain proposals for the support of Holland by French nightbombers, and these proposals had been sent to the allied military Council in London^     General Vuillemin said thatthis was only a &quot;projet&quot; and that there was nothingdefinite.      General Gamelin again insisted that theBritish Government should moke proposals to the FrenchGovernment on this matter.As regards invasion of Belgium and Hollandcombined with airattajok.*on^Iiut.chwand Belgium towns..General Gamclin said the French would regard it m thesame light as if delivered on themselves.     VYhenquestioned further he was equivocal over the case ofHolland13.       Ad a result of this discussions a signal A. 163dated 15th April, 1940, was despatched to the Chief of theAir Staff.      Owing to the difficulties of difference in language certain misconceptions arose and the result was that the exact meaning of the decision of theComite de Guerre of the .13th April, 1940 was misrepresentedin 1his signal.

14. The Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief hr-&amp;an interview with General Vuillonin at 1830 hours &quot;on15th April, 1940.The exact meaning of the reply from theComite de Guerre to the British Government, on 13thApril, 1940, was as follows:-(i)       As regards this attack, that there must &quot;be complete agreement between the French andBritish Commands as to the  objectives,their nature and their military importancein connection with operations envisaged -(ii)       That it is against the French interests to initiate any air action against factoriesor other objectives which will affect the civilian population, and that on our twoCommands is placed the responsibility of taking a decision to retaliate at theappropriate moment.15. General VyJLllemin went on to say that these should &quot;be interpreted as meaning that:-(i)    -,  The decision to launch air attack on object-ives to delay the advance of German armies,:,by Air Forces under the control of GeneralVUIllcnin and the Air Officer Commandinn--in--Ohief, British Air Forces in France, will be;taken between   General Vuillemin, General&apos; iGamelin and the Air Officer Commanding-in-; : Chief.(ii)       The decision to attack German industrialr  targets, in the Ruhr and elsewhere, by theI heavy bombers of Bomber Command will be! 1 taken after agreement has been reachedII between Generals Gameliri and Vuiilendh on11 the French side, and the British Chief of[   Air Staff representing the British High\Command on the other.(Signed)   &apos; A,S.
