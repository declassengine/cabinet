TO BE KEPT UNDER uOCK AND KEY.\t is requested that special care may be taken t&amp;n-nv      &quot;&quot;*Mj  ensure the secrecy of this document.W.P. (40) 170,26th May, 1940.WAR   CABINET,SUGGESTED APPROACH TO SIGNOR MUSSOLINI.Memorandum &quot;by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.By direction of the Prime Minister, I circulate this statement which shows briefly what has passed between HisMajesty&apos;s Government and-the French Government on the subject ofthe possibility of securing mediation in some form by theItalian Government.Monsieur Reynaud came to London today and explained theciritical situation in which France finds herself.He enquired whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would join withthe French Government in making a direct approach to signor mussolini on the following lines.A frank explanation of position in which Signor Mussoliniwill be placed if the Germans establish domination in Europe,Great Britain and France will fight to the end for thepreservation of their independence:   and they will be helped by the resources of other nations now outside the war.If Signor Mussolini will co-operate with us in securing asettlement of all European questions which safeguard theindependence and security of the Allies, and could be thebasis of a just and durable peace for Europe, we will under-take at once to discuss, with the desire to find solutions,the matters in which Signor Mussolini is primarily interested.We understand that he desires the solution of certainMediterranean questions;   and if he will state in secrecywhat these are, France and Great Britain will at once do their best to meet his wishes, on the basis of co-operationset out above.Meanwhile, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador In Washington telegraphedon May 26th at &quot;12.54 a.m. that he had agreed with his Frenchcolleague the text of a joint communication to the President ofthe United States.The text reads as follows:&quot;The Allied Governments suggest the President on his own initiative should ask Signor Mussolini for the reasons which apparently induce him to contemplate an immediate entry intothe war against the Allies and that he should further state thatif Signor Mussolini will inform him of his grievances, orclaims against the Allies he will immediately communicate them

ro 6\a 6 hP . S othem to the Allied Governments in order to leave nothingundone to prevent an extension of the war.They suggest the President should inform Signor Mussolinithat he had reason to believe that the attitude of the Alliestowards the Italian Government can &quot;be defined as follows.(a) The Allied Governments are aware that the ItalianGovernment entertains certain grievances in regard to theItalian position in the Mediterranean.(b) The Allied Governments would welcome Italianparticipation at the Peace Conference with a status equal tothat of the belligerents.(c) Signor Mussolini uould thus be invited by the president to notify him for transmission to the Allies the claims ofItaly the fulfilment of which would in his view ensure theestablishment in the Mediterranean of a new order guaranteeingto Italy satisfaction of Italian legitimate aspirations inthat sea, if the negotiations succeeded the President wouldthen formally record(a) the agreement thus arrived at(b) the undertaking of the Allies to execute theagreement at the end of the war(c) the assurance of Signor Mussolini that theclaims of Italy would be satisfied by the executionof this agreement 0     The agreement thus arrived atto be dependant of course on Italy not entering thewar against the Allies.&quot;Lord Lothian was this morning authorised to,make this communication to the President, with his French colleague, and heshould have made it this afternoon.Yesterday, I saw the Italian Ambassador, and I annex a record of my conversation with him.Monsieur Reynaud was not given any definite reply, beforereturning to Paris, on the subject of his present proposal.     Inthe actual circumstances it holds out only a very slender chanceof success, and that chance would seem to depend principally onthe degree of discomfort which the prospect of a Europe dominated by Hitler may cause to Mussolini,It was understood that we should endeavour to give MonsieurReynaud a reply tomorrow.H.

3 8R.S.Since drafting the above, I have seen the Master of the rolls, who has just returned from Rome.     He tells me that sir P. Loraine had been informed by the United states ambassador that President Roosevelt&apos;s last attempt to deterthe Italian Government had been bitterly resented by signor mussolini as unwarrantable interference with Italy!s privateaffairs.     He further reports that Sir P. Loraine&apos;s judgementis that any further approach would only be interpreted as a sign of weakness and would do no good.The Master of the Rolls, however, was disposed to thinkthat the situation could hardly be made worse by the approach-suggested by Monsieur Reynaud, and that the first considerationthere set out must be very present to Signor Mussolini&apos;s mind.H.FOREIGN OFFICE,26th May, 194-0.

I &apos; 9   oForeign Office,May 25th, 1940.Sir,I asked the Italian Ambassador to call this afternoon.[r p. 2.   I told His Excellency that I wished to speak toLoraine,      him because I had reason to think that a misunderstandingRome-.       had arisen&quot;-with regard to the possibility of some state-men t being made by His Majesty s Government about thepolitical issues between our two countries.   It waso. 415. quite true that we had intended to make an approach, inappropriate form, to certain political questions, follow-ing on the approach which we had made to questions con-cerning contraband control;   and in any such approach weshould have wished to make plain our desire that italy should naturally take her proper place at a peaceconference by the side of the belligerents.   I had,&apos;however, hesitated to make the approach in questionbecause of the discouraging nature of the reply whichSignor Mussolini had sent through Count Ciano to a personal communication from the Prime Minister, which had led me to doubt whether any useful purpose would be served by our trying to define our position more closely to the Italian Government.   In view, however, of themisunderstanding which seemed to have arisen, I wished totake the opportunity of saying that while we fully recognised the special relations in which Italy stood to.Germany, we had always been quite willing to discuss any questions between our two countries and to endeavour toreach solutions satisfactory to both sides.   His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be willing at any time to propose such a discussion to the Italian Government if we could have some assurance that we should not be rebuffed.   If and when weshould ever receive an indication that our approach mightbe received with due consideration, we should be preparedto carry the matter further and deal with it in greater detail.   Personally I should hope, and I felt sure thatthis would be the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, thatthe measure of success which we were in the way of achieving as regards the difficulties connected, withcontraband control might serve to open the way to thetreatment of other questions, always provided that wecould approach these questions on the basis of the frankestrecognition of the rights and necessities of both parties.5. I told His Excellency that I had thought thatI ought to give him this message in order that I might feel, and perhaps His Excellency also, that, so far aswe were concerned, nothing had been left undone that could help to avoid any misunderstanding, or somethingworse, between our two countriese

4.   Signor Bastianini thanked me very much for my communication,,     Pie said that he had no knowledgeof the exchange of letters between -ignor Mussoliniand the Prime Minister, hut that he would of courseimmediately pass on what I had said to his Government,It had, however, always been Signor Mussolini&apos;s viewthat the settlement of problems between Italy andany other country should be part of a general Europeansettlement, and His Excellency asked me whether he might inform his Government that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment considered it opportune now to examine thequestions at issue between our two countries withinthe larger framework of a European settlement.5.   I said that I had always thought, if any discussions were to be held with a view to solvingEuropean questions and building a peaceful Europe,that matters which caused anxiety to Italy mustcertainly be discussed as part of the generalEuropean settlement.6,   Whether or not it might be possible to bringmatters, which caused anxiety to Italy, to solutionwhile the war was still in progress would no doubtdepend upon the nature of the issues raised, and uponthe course which any discussions might take.7.   Signor Bastianini then said that he wouldlike to know whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would consider it possible to discuss general questionsInvolving not only Great Britain and Italy, but othercountrieso     On my saying that it was difficult tovisualise such wide discussions while the war was still proceeding, the Ambassador replied that oncesuch a discussion were begun, war would be pointless.8.   Signor Mussolini, said the Ambassador, was interested in European questions - the Ambassadormentioned Poland - and was always concerned to build a European settlement, that would not merely be an armistice, but would protect European peace for a century.     I said that the purpose of His Majesty&apos;s-Government was the same, and they would never be unwilling to consider any proposal made with authority that gave promise of the establishment of a secure and peaceful Europe,     I added that I thought I could saythat this would also be the attitude of the FrenchGovernment.9.   The Ambassador warmly agreed with anobservation that I had made to the effect that when we came&apos; to such discussions, Signor- Mussolini&apos; wouldhave an absolutely vital part to play.     signor mussolini was always ready to help in securing a wider

wider European settlement because he saw thesolution of Italian problems only within the frame-I  work of the solution of all the jproblems of all other  European countries*10.   His Excellency said that he would like tobe able to inform Signor -Mussolini that His Majesty &apos;sGovernment did not exclude the possibility of some discussion of the wider problems of Europe in theevent of the opportunity arising.     This I told HisExcellency he could certainly do, for plainly thesecure peace in Europe that both Signor Mussoliniand we desired to see established could only come bythe finding through frank discussion of solutionsthat were generally acceptable and by the jointdetermination of the Great Powers to maintain them.(Signed)HALIFAX.
