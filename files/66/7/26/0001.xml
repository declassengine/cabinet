There were at the moment about two regiments of troops from south Austria around Narvik, and it was expected that they could last out for at least a month. They would then withdraw after having destroyed the railway from Narvik to the Swedish iron mines. Northern Norway would be left as anapparent success for the English, who, it was hoped, would then be induced to invade Sweden. The King of Sweden had sent Hitler a personal letter givingpositive assurances that Sweden would resist a British invasion. If she did not,Germany would prevent a British occupation.The German success in Norway had been achieved by troops with artillery and full equipment, and whole regiments had been sent to Norway by air in a few hours. Losses, greater than was expected, had indeed been sustained, but thiswould not deflect the Germans from their next main object, namely,&apos; an air attack^onJBiitisb-po^8T--7They set high hopes on their air force, which was considerecTin a large measure to have offset British naval superiority. The main base forthe attack would be Trondheim, which would be a German &quot; Singapore.&quot;It was hoped that this attack, which was to take place as soon as the germans were organised, would make England see that this war was not profitable.   Thewar might then be over before next winter.\ Turning to other fields, the General said that the Germans were stillI preoccupied by the Balkans generally, and in particular by the Roumanian oilI question. On this, no decision had yet been taken. The source gathered that1 there was little expectation of Italy entering the war on the side of Germany,1   though considerable moral and diplomatic help was expected from her.11017   [21241]
