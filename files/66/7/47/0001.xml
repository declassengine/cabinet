3(17el u fGeneral Review.THE situation in Home waters has been largely dominated by the Germanthrust towards the Channel, which has been accompanied by heavy bombing of theFrench Channel ports and great minelaying activity by aircraft.Shipping has been diverted from passage through the Mediterranean, where our forces continue to be strengthened.There has been a slight recrudescence of U-boat activity.Operations in Northern Norway have continued to maike considerable callson our Naval resources, especially destroyers, and there has been increased enemy air activity in that area.The second convoy of Australian and New Zealand troops has arrived inEgypt and the fourth convoy of Canadian troops in the United Kingdom.North Sea.2. On the 17th May an enemy convoy of seven ships with destroyer escortwas attacked by our aircraft off the Lister Light (Norway). One ship was damaged.Armed Danish fishing vessels were also attacked by our aircraft on the19th and the 20th May, and on the latter date H.M. Submarine Spear fish sank two of these vessels in position 135 miles W.S.W. of Horns Reef. H.M.Submarine Sealion, on her return from patrol off the Skaw, reported havingsuccessfully attacked two south-bound merchant vessels on the 6th May, one ofwhich was believed to be the s.s. Reichenfels.Enemy M.T.Bs. have shown increased activity in the southern North Sea, andon the 20th May 9 M.T.Bs. were unsuccessfully attacked by our aircraft 25 miles north of Ymuiden.When returning from minelaying in the east coast barrier H.M. MinelayerPrincess Victoria was mined and sunk off the entrance to the Humber on the18th May. The Princess Victoria was degaussed and the mine is considered tohave been magnetic with delayed action. Twelve officers and 79 ratings wererescued.   Casualties were 36 killed and 10 wounded.On the 20th May three destroyers and six trawlers cut six telegraph cablesconnecting the east coast with Borkum and Norderney.Operations off the Dutch and Belgian Coasts.3. Ships engaged in these operations have been subjected to heavy bombing,and greatly hampered by the promiscuous laying of mines by enemy aircraft.Four destroyers, which had been placed under the orders of the french admiral du Nord, continued to carry out A.A. protection off the Belgian coastfrom the 16th to the 19th May on which date they were withdrawn. Subsequently,with other destroyers and various small craft, they have been employed in thetransport and protection of military traffic and large numbers of refugees crossingto southern British ports.4; H.M.S. Westminster, after colliding with a wreck in Dunkirk approaches,was docked there for temporary repairs. She reached Portsmouth in tow of atug on the 21st May.On the 19th May H.M.S. Whitley was hit by bombs off Nieuport and brokeher back.  She was afterwards set on fire and destroyed by H.M.S. Keith.On the 20th May a French destroyer and two oilers were sunk by bombsoff Dunkirk. On the same day H.M. trawlers Lord Inchape and Rifsness were attacked off Ostend, the latter being sunk; the French minesweeper AugustinNormand was sunk off Le Havre; and H.M.S. Malcolm, 35 miles east off north foreland, and H.M. corvette arab is, off Beachy Head, were unsuccessfully attacked. A near miss killed 3 and seriously wounded 10 in H.M.S. Malcolm.On the 22nd May H.M. minesweeper Corburn operating off Havre was mined and sunk.During night of 22nd-23rd May the British Army Hospital Carrier Maid ofKent was bombed and set on fire in Dieppe harbour.[21314] &apos; b
Details of attacks on merchant ships are given in Appendix I.A strong patrol of British and French submarines has been maintained offthe north Dutch coast. The French S/M Doris, which was on this patrol, havingfailed to report, is considered lost.5. The work of demolition parties landed in Holland resulted in thedestruction of oil stocks at Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Ymuiden. At Ymuidenthere is a channel only 200 feet in breadth between the piers as a result of the sinking of merchant ships in the harbour mouth. At the Hook guns were destroyed and cranes and rolling stock damaged.The seaplane base at de Mok, on the Texel, and the adjacent aerodrome were destroyed. Three Dutch S/M&apos;s were also sunk in shallow water. At Delfzyl anumber of German ships were shut in by the sinking of barges and the destructionof sluices.At Flushing the Dutch destroyer Philip d&apos;A Imond, which was nearing completion, and also an oil refinery with 2,000 tons of Diesel oil were destroyed.At Antwerp 26 ships were sent to sea and all dredgers, tugs and barges gotaway to Belgian ports. All dry docks and heavy cranes were destroyed and also150,000 tons of oil.The project of blocking Ostend and Zeebrugge with block ships has been suspended.All Dutch naval and civil trawlers, also six mine-layers and mine-sweepers, after being degaussed, are to be based at Falmouth under Dutchadministration. Twenty-four Dutch seaplanes and flying boats have arrived atCalshot and are to operate from there.6. On the 22nd May two battalions of troops in two transports, escorted byH.M.S. Vimiera and H.M.S. WHITSHED, were landed at Boulogne.At 4-50 p.m. on the 23rd May demolitions at Boulogne were ordered to becarried out forthwith.After very heavy fighting all day Boulogne was evacuated, and all except 200 British military personnel were taken off in H.M. Destroyers Keith,WHITSHED, Wild Swan, Venomous, Vimy, Venetia, Wessex and Vimiera, all of whom suffered casualties, including Captain (D) in H.M.S. Keith. Evacuationwas carried out under difficult conditions with continuous bombing from the air.Northern Waters.Iceland.7. The force of Royal Marines which had been landed at Reykjavik on the10th May was relieved on the 17th May, when 3,800 troops were landed fromS.S. Franconia and S.S. Lancastria.H.M.S. Guardian, engaged on net-laying on the coast, grounded on anuncharted rock on the 16th May. She can still steam and is returning to theUnited Kingdom for docking.Narvik Area.8. Operations have been subjected to constant bombing from enemy aircraft,and on the 17th May H.M.S. Resolution was hit by a bomb which pierced threedecks and caused slight damage. Casualties were one dead and nine wounded.She has now arrived back at Scapa. Four supply ships have been sunk by bombduring the week, but large quantities of stores have been landed safely.On the 16th May the French destroyer Foudroya,nt sank 2 enemy seaplanesand one or two small craft; she also shelled the head of Els Fjord and dismountedseveral guns mounted there.While operating in the Narvik area on the 17th May H.M.S. Ejfinghamgrounded and sustained such severe damage that it is not considered practicable to bring her back to the United Kingdom. H.M.S. Matabele, who was with .M.S. Ejfingham, was also damaged and returned to Harstadt.On the 20th May H.M.S. Furious and H.M.S. Glorious flew offGladiators to Bardu Foss aerodrome. Aircraft from H.M.S. Ark Royal havebeen acting in support of operations during the week. All the carriers have nowbeen withdrawn.The Flag Officer, Narvik, has transferred his flag and staff to the shore atHarstadt.
Foreign Waters.9. The Mediterranean has been partially closed to shipping. further reinforcements of destroyers have arrived, and a patrol of 5 armed merchant cruisers has been established off the west coast of Spain and Portugal.Two moored minefields have been found off the South African coast. On the15th May a batch of mines was discovered by. sweepers off Cape Agulhas nearSimonstown, and later others were reported 5 miles south of Durban. It isthought possible that these mines may be connected with the suspicious vesselreported to be 600 miles west of Portuguese West Africa on the 2nd May. Thisvessel was reported as having Japanese colours painted on her side, while noJapanese ship is believed to have been in that area. The possibility of her being a raider is strengthened by the non-arrival of the British S.S. Scientist atFreetown after leaving Durban on the 27th April for that port. The departure of the German tanker Winnetou from Las Palmas on the 9th April, and theunduly long time taken by the German tanker Rudolph Albrecht in her passage from the Azores to Teneriffe, may indicate that these vessels are acting as supplyships.The German S.S. Rhakotis (6,753 tons) sailed from Callao in Peru on the16th May. She was subsequently sighted by a Dutch ship close into theS. American coast in lat. 230 S., which seems to indicate that she may be making for the Atlantic.German Attack on Seaborne Trade.10. During the week one Swedish ship was sunk by gunfire from a U-boat and one British ship unsuccessfully attacked in a similar manner. One small british ship and one French ship were mined and sunk. Four British ships were sunk by aircraft attack in the Narvik area.  Details are given in Appendix I.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. A total of 743 ships, of which 93 were Allied and 37 neutral, were convoyed during the week and there were no losses. Since the commencementof hostilities 21,511 ships, including 1,364 Allied and 3,100 neutral, have beenconvoyed, out of which 31 have been sunk, an average of 1 in 694.One battleship, one cruiser and 7 armed merchant cruisers were employed as ocean escorts.Imports into Great Britain in convoy during the week amounted to1,188,063 tons, compared with 848,904 tons during the previous seven days.Imports of oil amounted to 454,560 tons, which arrived in 38 tankers; of these5 tankers with 60,500 tons were for France. Cereal imports.were 201,669 tons,brought by fifteen ships, two of which carried over 10,000 tons each. mineral imports were 189,883 tons, an increase of 7,554 tons.Food imports, other than grain and flour, were 111,007 tons, of which26,957 tons were sugar, molasses and glucose. The oil refinery ship SouthernPrincess (12,156 tons) brought 11,106 tons of whale oil and 171 tons of liverflakes, and the Terje Viken (20,638 tons) had 19,250 tons of whale oil, 80 tonsof sperm oil and, 1,150 tons of meat meal.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. On the 18th May one of our aircraft made two attacks on U-boats off. the north-west coast of Scotland. H.M.S. Deptford attacked a possible U-boatcontact in the Western approaches on the 22nd May. H.M.S. Rochester wasmissed by a torpedo 90 miles W.S.W. of Land&apos;s End on the morning of the 23rd,and then delivered three attacks on a U-boat contact. The hunt for this U-boatcontinues.German Intelligence.13. Air reconnaissance on the 18th and 19th May showed the battleshipBismarck alongside at Hamburg and Tirpitz at Wilhelmshaven. The formerappears to be the more advanced of the two and to be almost complete. the later reconnaissance showed a pocket battleship, almost certainly the admiral scheer, in dry dock at Wilhelmshaven. Destroyers or torpedo boats have been[21314] &apos; * B2
observed on convoy escort to Norway and escorting an unidentified ship to theEms. M.T.B&apos;s were observed off the Dutch coast, a force of nine on the 20thand six on the following day. Two or three U-boats are operating in the western approaches.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.14. During the week from the 15th May to 22nd May enemy minelayingby aircraft has moved west to the French ports. At the beginning of the weekmines were dropped off the Belgian ports, and our minesweeping vessels were operating at Zeebrugge and Ostend though tlhe base had to be moved fromZeebrugge to Dunkirk. During the last few days mines have been dropped bothoutside and inside the harbours of Dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne, Dieppe, Le Havreand in the River Seine between Le Havre and Rouen. Dieppe has been closedsince the 18th May, and Le Havre with the River Seine approaches was closedon the 19th May. &apos; With the exception of Dieppe all the other ports have been opened for degaussed ships. Extra pairs of LL trawlers are operating underthe orders of the Vice-Admiral, Dover, and assisting the French in sweepingthe French and Belgian ports.During sweeping operations by LL trawlers off Zeebrugge on the 15th Mayseven mines were exploded, and three more on the 18th May.15. The dangerous area which had been declared east of Deal was cancelledon the 20th May as it had been swept without further result.Owing to the possibility of mines having been dropped by enemy aircraft on the night of the 16th May off Beachy Head and the Royal Sovereign LightVessel, shipping was diverted to the southward. Enemy aircraft were very active on the night of the 21st May over the eastern end of the Channel, but nomines were seen to drop.In view of the enemy&apos;s practice of laying magnetic mines in the entrances to and inside harbours the Admiralty have directed that a percentage of1113/11c sweeps should be converted to small sweeps which could be used bycraft with shallow draft in restricted waters.LL sweeps exploded two mines outside the Humber on the 16th May anda third was exploded by M Sweep on the 21st May.Skids exploded a mine off the Shambles Shoal on the 15th May. It ispresumed that this mine was laid about the 15th September.Altogether 188 magnetic mines have now been exploded. In addition, elevenmagnetic mines have been recovered.16. It is now known that 7 contact mines were cut or exploded off Smith&apos;sKnoll before H.M.S. Dunoon was mined on the 30th April.The 5th Minesweeping Flotilla have cut or exploded 9 mines in the Tynearea east of the War Channel. It had been intended to define the eastern limit ofthis field and clear the northern portion, but the operation is in abeyance forthe time being.The 12th Minesweeping Flotilla have swept 5 more mines in the Wold nearHaisborough Light Vessel. These were in the dangerous area declared afterthe mining of the Dosinia on the 21st December.The total of contact mines dealt with to date is 383.British Minelayingi17. Mines have been laid in the. current week by H.M.S. Princess Victoriaand the 20th Flotilla in the East Coast Barrier.Minelaying by aircraft has been extended to include the coast of Holland.German Merchant Shipping.18. The German ships blocked in Delfzyl (vide paragraph 5 above) are reported to be : A ugust Bolten (3,665 tons), Bolten Hagen (3,335 tons), Casablanca(2,313 tons), Jersbek (2,900 tons), Palermo (1,461 tons), Thielbek (1,883 tons),Wittekind (4,029 tons), Wolfgang L.M. Russ (3,750 tons), Zeus (2,500 tons) andthe Nordlight, which has not been identified and is possibly a lighter.The Bremen (51,731 tons) and the Europa (49,746 tons) have been identifiedat Walter Schopen Haven, Hamburg.
A German broadcast of the 19th May stated that DerDeutsche (11,453 tons)had left Eeval on the 18th May with 460 resettlers, thus completing the resettlement of German nationals from Estonia.The Ithaka (1,773 tons), which was reported last week as being in dock atConstanza, arrived at Sulina on the 15th May.The German losses to date (the 22nd May) are as follows :  Gross tons.Definitely sunk or scuttled   ...      ...       ...       ..,      370,500Captured        ..........,.......      259,100Tonnage estimated to have been sank in additionby S/Ms. and aircraft, unidentified  ...      ...      190,000819,600say, 820,000 gross tons, which is about 20 per cent, of the German pre-warmercantile tonnage of 4,200,000 tons.Comparisons of Norwegian, Danish, Dutch and Belgian Tonnage Gained by theEnemy and the Allies.19. The Danish, Norwegian, Dutch and Belgian tonnage acquired by theGermans is approximately : Tons.Danish and Norwegian     ...      ...       ...      911,000Dutch and Belgian............      250,0001,161,000On the other hand, the Allies have acquired the use of approximately3,700,000 tons of Danish and Norwegian shipping (of which 1,700,000 tons aretankers). Dutch and Belgian tonnage also available for British and Allied use is approximately 1,250,000 tons (including some 209,000 tons of tankers).Economic Warfare.20. During the week ending the 18th May 8,024 tons of goods destined for germany were seized in prize. The main bulk consisted of 6,013 tons of chemicalproducts, including tanning materials, the bulk of which came off a Latvian ship.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Front.21. The German advance towards the Channel ports has progressed withremarkable rapidity during the last week. The main German thrust has beencarried out by a mechanised army, believed to include nine armoured divisions.The first objective of this army appears to have been the area Bapaume-Amiens,and thence to Abbeville, Montreuil and Le Treport. After reaching Amiensthe bulk of five armoured divisions swung northwards towards Boulogne andCalais. The situation now is that these five German armoured divisions are inthe area Montreuil-Hesdin-Doullens-Domart, with elements moving northwardstowards Boulogne, Calais and St. Omer. Four further German armoured divisions are in the area Cambrai, Valenciennes, Avesnes. Those forces arebeing followed by motorised and infantry divisions. The left flank of the Germanthrust has been protected by a strong German army holding a front from Chaunyto, south of Sedan. Two more armies are operating north of a line St. Amand-Mons-Namur.The ultimate object of the German offensive appears to be the destruc-tion of the Allied Forces in the area north-east of the River Somme.British Expeditionary Force.22. During the night the 16th/17th May the B.E.F. withdrew to the lineHal-River Senne-Vilvorde.
The following night this withdrawal was continued to the line of theRiver Dendre, leaving rear guards on the line Enghien-Aasche.During the night of 18th/19th May the retreat was continued to theline of River Escaut.G.H.Q. was evacuated from Arras.12th and 23rd Divisions took up a position behind the Canal Du Nord, thebridges over which were blown. Two small composite forces, Macforce (one battalion I Tanks one infantry brigade, one regiment R.H.A.) and Lumsden&apos;sgroup (12th Lancers, one R.H.A. battery, 1st Welsh Guards), were formed to coverthis flank.On the 20th May the position was substantially unchanged.On the 21st May the main portion of the B.E.E. remained in position onthe River Escaut, where a German attack was repulsed. On the right a counter-attack was launched from the general line Lens-Raches-River Scarpe by5th and 50th Divisions, with two French divisions co-operating, across the Germanaxis of advance on the road Arras-Cambrai.Two Guards battalions, with eight anti-tank guns, were rushed across toBoulogne for the local protection of the town against advanced detachments of enemy A.F.V.&apos;s, which were approaching the Channel ports. All roads leadingfrom south and south-east were blocked, and the bridges between Hesdin andMontreuil were blown.The general line held by the B.E.F. remained unchanged on the 22nd May.Further small detachments were sent over for the defence of the Channel ports.Scandinavia.Narvik Area.23. Allied Forces advancing south from Gratangen and north from Bjervikhave now made contact. The Germans in this area have withdrawn eastwardsfor a distance of about 4 miles, where they are gradually being forced to withdraw to the line of the railway and are faced with the alternatives of retiring intoSweden or being captured by superior Allied Forces unless:help arrives in time.There has been little change in the Ankenes peninsula south of Narvik.A number of German troop-carrying aircraft have been seen flyingNorth over the Narvik area. One report states that the Germans have beenrepairing the railway East of Narvik. :Mo-Bodo.24. In the Mo-Bodo area 150 miles South of Narvik, 1st Scots Guards andone Independent Company have been forced to withdraw to a position astride the road about 20 miles N.E. of Mo. No serious pressure has developed on this position yet, but the enemy has succeeded in pushing a force of 2,000 to 3,000men with some light tanks and artillery North of Mosjoen, and has- succeeded in reaching Mo. The country between Mo and Narvik is extremely difficult for thepassage of troops, and there is only one good road which is interrupted by fjords.There is believed to be a total of about six German divisions in Norway, i.e.,possibly 120,000 men.Middle East.25. The second flight of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force consisting ofa Brigade Group with certain divisional units arrived in Southern Palestine onthe 18th and the 19th May, 1940.Aden.26. A second Indian infantry battalion 1/2 Punjab Regiment arrivedat Aden on the 11th May, 1940.Africa.27. The 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesian Regiment arrived at Berbera onthe 18th May from Mombasa, to act as reinforcements to British Troops inSomaliland.
Mediterranean.28. The 8th Manchesters proceeded from Gibraltar to Malta on 17th May.Iceland.29. The 147th Infantry Brigade and certain attached troops landed in iceland on the 18th May.Italy and Italian Possessions.30. Although reports have been received concerning &quot; imminent mobilisa-tion &apos;&apos; of the Italian Army, it should be borne in mind that the army has to allintents and purposes been mobilised for the past two weeks. There is thus no particular need to call up large numbers of additional reservists, who could notconveniently be absorbed at present in existing units, and for whom there is inadequate armament and equipment to form a large number of new units. Apartfrom small numbers of specialists, a few reservist classes might be called up fordepot training to meet eventual war wastage, but, although this might be apointer to Italy&apos;s attitude, it would not affect the initial fighting strength of theItalian Army.There has been no definite confirmation of the reported move of Illrd Corpsfrom the Milan area towards the Yugoslav frontier. It seems fairly clear thatthe formations of IXth Corps have been concentrated in the Bari area, where theycan conveniently be embarked for Albania.The garrison of Albania appears also to have been numerically increased and must now be at war strength. The probable destination of 24th Division, ifalso despatched there, is still obscure. The despatch of an additional division to Albania need not be taken as an offensive measure, particularly if the divisionmoves to northern Albania opposite Yugoslav forces of at least three infantry divisions (duplicated when fully mobilised) in southern Yugoslavia and anotherinfantry division at Cetinje on the Dalmatian coast.Actual reinforcement of overseas territories appears so far to have been confined to the despatch of some further reservists, possibly 1916 class, in limitednumbers to Albania and Libya, where shortages of personnel were recently noted,and the movement of war material to these areas continues in relatively small quantities from time to time. General mobilisation is being secretly carriedout in Italian East Africa. This measure may or may not be a precaution dueto the increased general tension, which incidentally generally encourages the rebels to greater activity.Reports of German troops being despatched to Italy have not been confirmed.Far East.Netherlands East Indies.31. The Japanese are reported to have presented to the Dutch authorities alist of requirements designed to secure their trading position in the netherlands east Indies and to ensure the uninterrupted supply to Japan of certain rawmaterials.It is thought that, under the present Japanese Government, action againstthe Netherlands East Indies would only take place in the event of a breakdown of these negotiations an unlikely contingency; but it is possible that theJapanese may indulge in fleet movements of a minor but ostentatious nature asan inducement to speedy action on the part of the Dutch.AIR SITUATION.Royal Air Force Operations.Fighter Command (Home).32. Enemy air activity has again been mainly in support of the operations on the Western Front and in Norway. Comparatively few raids have been plottedexcept off the south coast, and on the 18th-19th May off the south-east coast, whenthirty-seven plots were recorded between Harwich and Beachy Head.   Anti-
Attacks on Germany.33. Heavy attacks on communications and industrial targets in Germanyhave been continued throughout the week under favourable conditions, and havebeen little hampered by enemy action. Attacks have been mainly directed againstoil storage and oil production plant, and against railway and road communica-tions; raids have also been made on enemy aerodromes. Raids have been followed by high-level photographic reconnaissance during the day.34. On the night of Thursday, the 16th/17th May, twenty-one aircraft wereactive, one of which crashed (on landing) in France. Eight of these bombed therailway connexions leading through Munchen-Giadbach and Aachen to holland and Belgium. The remainder were over the Ruhr and attacked aerodromes atBuer and Duisburg, railways and yards at dusseldorf, Dortmund and Lunen, and oil-plants at Wanne and Kastrop. On the next night (the 17th/18th May) sixWellingtons attacked somewhat further south, their targets being railways intihe Koln, Wedau and Vohwinkel areas, while sixty-eight aircraft made an intensive attack on oil storage at Hamburg and Bremen. Balloon barrages were reported in the neighbourhood of both these towns. The results achievedappeared to be highly successful; separate explosions followed the dropping ofour bombs and enormous fires were started, which were still burning twenty-four hours later.  All aircraft engaged returned safely.35. This raid was repeated on the 18th/19th May by twenty-three aircraft of Coastal Command, of which two failed to return; results were again good.On the same night twenty-three Whitleys attacked the oil refinery at Misburgnear Hanover, and twelve Wellingtons maintained attacks on railway communi-cations in the Krefeld-Kamen area. Great damage appeared to have been done to the oil refinery, and this has subsequently been confirmed by reports from otherquarters. One aircraft failed to return. Forty-eight aircraft were engaged onthe following night (the 19th/20th May), and all but two returned safely, in spiteof intense anti-aircraft fire; the objectives included oil-plants at Dortmund andSaizburgen, and railways in various parts of the Ruhr. Forty-seven 500-lb.bombs, 68 250-lb. and 300 incendiary bombs were dropped at Saizburgen, andsmaller quantities elsewhere.36. On the 20th-21st May five Beauforts of Coastal Command raided oil tanks at Rotterdam with great effect, and also damaged a refinery plant nearthem; and on the following night (the 21st-22nd May) raids on the Ruhr andon the railway communications of the Western Rhineland were carried out byforty-eight Whitleys and twenty-five Hampdens. Five hits on trains, seven onstations and yards, and eleven on the permanent way were claimed by theHampdens, and the Whitleys were also very successful. One Whitley and oneHampden were lost.Only six aircraft operating from England were active over Germany on the22nd-23rd May, but had very considerable success in the Aachen area. Twostationary goods-trains were hit in a cutting, which may have been blocked; andtwo other trains blew up with heavy explosions after the attack. All aircraftreturned. On the same night medium bombers of the A.A.S.F. bombed blastfurnaces at Saarburg, on which hits were obtained, and railway lines west ofBingen.aircraft guns have been in action on several occasions during the week and claimto have shot down one enemy aircraft off Dover on the night of the 18th-19th.On the night of the 21st-22nd May explosions were heard close to Deal andHarwich, which may have been due to either bombs or prematurely explodingmines. On one or two occasions enemy aircraft have at night flown over some ofthe Southern Counties, small bombs on one occasion being jettisoned in Sussex.On the nights of the 20th-21st, 21st-22nd May, attacks were made on shippingclose to the south coast and minelaying took place on several nights during theweek, apparently as far south as Le Havre. A number of fighters were sent upbut no interceptions were made.
Western Front.38. On the 16th May the Headquarters of the A.A.S.F. and seven squadronsmoved into new locations in Southern Champagne, and operations were accordingly somewhat restricted. Twenty medium bombers were, however,employed against enemy transport in the Sedan area. Twenty-nine recon-reconnaissances were prpvided by the Air Component, with the loss of four aircraft.39. A raid was planned for early on the 17th May against communicationsnear Gembloux, but twelve Blenheims which were despatched met heavy anti-aircraft and fighter opposition and were unable to reach the objective; elevenfailed to return. Forty-six Wellingtons and five Hampdens attacked this area and the crossings of the Meuse during the night and all returned safely. Onespan of a road-bridge at Rhisnes was demolished and the railway bridge therewas hit; six bombs fell on the cross-roads at Gembloux. Heavy traffic was seen on the Gembloux-Brussels road, and it is believed that considerable damage was done. On the 18th May thirty-nine Blenheims were sent out from this countryto aerodromes in France to assist operations by bombing enemy columns on theupper Sambre and Oise. They found it difficult to obtain sufficiently clear indication of their objectives, and a number of them did not bomb. Three aircraft were lost. Operations against the Meuse crossings were resumed during the night the 18th-19th May; eleven Hampdens and twelve Wellingtons took part and all returned safely. Hits were secured at Givet and Gembloux and onbridges at Namur. Road and railway communications in the same area were also damaged.40. On the 19th May seventeen Battles of the A.A.S.F. were used against enemy troop concentrations, under escort by twenty-six Hurricanes, which had several successful combats; six Battles were lost. During the night thirtyWellingtons continued operations in the Gembloux area and in the Ardennes, and returned safely. A canal bridge was hit at Charleroi and a level crossingappeared to be put out of action at Hal. On the 20th May forty-seven Blenheimswent from bases in England to harass advancing mechanised columns in the arras-Cambrai-Bapaume area, with a Hurricane escort, which shot down oneHs. 126. The Blenheims had no difficulty in finding targets and returned safelyafter bombing. Seventy-two heavy bombers and eighteen Blenheims were employed during the night on the enemy communications; only four failed toreturn. The bombers were active at Audenarde, Grammont and Hal on theBelgian front, against the Sambre and Oise bridges and in the salient towardHirson and St. Quentin. Several bridges were damaged, atrain was hit at Hirson,and what appeared to be an ammunition dump blew up at Nouvion.41. On Tuesday, the 21st May, following reconnaissances by two Blenheims,attacks were made almost continuously by Blenheims on enemy armoured unitsadvancing on Abbeville and Boulogne. Fifty-eight aircraft were engaged, ofwhich three were lost. Bombing was hampered only by the presence of refugeesin some areas, mingled with the German forces on the roads. Where it waspossible to bomb, the enemy columns presented very vulnerable targets and heavy damage was done. During the night 21st-22nd May the attack on the Meusecrossings and in the Liege-Maastricht area was kept up by forty-sevenWellingtons, of which three did not return, as well as by thirty-eight Battles ofthe A.A.S.F., one Battle failed to return. On the 22nd May attacks in theBoulogne-Abbeville area were resumed, forty-eight Blenheims (two lost) fromEnglish bases were engaged, and bombed heavily all enemy transport seen movingon the roads; direct hits were obtained on an enemy M.T. column. FifteenBattles of the A.A.S.F., as well as bombers from the Air Component, were employed in the same way. On the night of the 22nd/23rd the attacks were continued further East by forty-seven heavy bombers and by medium bombers of the A.A.S.F., which engaged communications in the Meuse area. The latteralso attacked blast furnaces at Charleville, and hits were obtained on arevictualling yard and warehouses at Florenville in the same area.42.. On the 23rd May twenty-four Blenheims were despatched to attackenemy columns converging on Arras, but owing to the presence of low cloud this task could not be accomplished, and the attack was made on the alternative target of troop concentrations in the Montreuil-Boulogne area.[21314] c
43. It has not been possible to obtain full combat statistics for the week, under review as communications with the fighter squadrons of the air component and the A.A.S.F. have been subject to interruption, and exact figures are in any case hard to obtain, as many of our own aircraft which havetemporarily lost touch may have landed away from their own aerodromes or havemade successful forced-landings.The British fighters in France have been engaged in continuous and intensivecombat throughout the week. They have been supported daily since the 17th Mayby squadrons from Fighter Command acting from English bases. These lattersquadrons alone destroyed 77 enemy aircraft certainly, and probably 38 others;their own losses were 35, five of which were destroyed on the ground by enemybombing. The fighter, squadrons based in France have been at least equallyheavily engaged, but it is still difficult to assess the casualties they have inflicted.Norway.44. On the 16th May three Blenheim fighters of Coastal Command escortednine Fleet Air Arm Skuas in an attack on petrol storage at Bergen. considerable damage was seen to be done to fuel tanks, six of which appeared to be on fire;this has subsequently been confirmed from other sources. AH aircraft returned safely. During the night of the 16th/ 17th May, Stavanger aerodrome andseaplane base were successfully attacked by five Hudsons; a hangar and probably a slipway were hit, and fires were started. On the following morning (the 17thMay) a Hudson was on patrol over Bergen, and reported on the damage doneby the previous day&apos;s raid; further high explosive and incendiary bombs were dropped. Later in the day three Blenheim fighters had an encounter with twoMesserschmitt 110&apos;s in the same area, shot down one and damaged another.Enemy bomber activity at Narvik continued and two enemy aircraft are reportedto have been brought down by gunfire at Mo.45. On the 19th May three Blenheims reconnoitred the coast as far asTrondhjem, and reported that a large number of Ju. 88&apos;s and Me. 110&apos;s werepresent on the aerodrome at Vaernes. Three thousand rounds were fired in a low-flying machine-gun attack, which met no serious opposition; a He. 59seaplane was found on the water later in the patrol, and was set on fire by.machine-gun bullets. This reconnaissance was followed by a raid by eightHudsons and a Blenheim on the night of the 19th/20th May; eighteen 250-lb.bombs and forty-eight incendiaries were dropped, and direct hits were reported.During the same night, three Blenheims attacked Stavanger as well as whatappeared to be a dummy or satellite aerodrome in the neighbourhood, started somefires with incendiary bombs and machine-gunned searchlight positions. Thisraid was repeated by three Hudsons on the night of Tuesday, the 21st/22nd May.In addition to these raids and combats, the usual reconnaissance of theNorwegian coast has been maintained during the week.46. An aerodrome some 40 miles from Narvik has now been madeserviceable, and a squadron of Gladiator fighters arrived there on the 21st Mayand is now operating from it.North Sea.47. On the 16th May two submarines were seen and bombed in the north sea, one direct hit was made with a bomb which failed to explode, and therewere several near misses, but no positive results are claimed. On the following day (the 17th May) an enemy convoy, which appeared to consist of four destroyersor torpedo-boats and about twelve merchantmen, was seen off the Norwegian coast,moving in two sections. A striking force of Hudsons was sent out to attack,and bombed one section, scoring near misses;, one merchant vessel was seen.to belisting badly and giving out steam. ,On the 18th May a submarine was twice attacked during the morning about70 miles N.W. of Cape Wrath; bombs fell close, but there was no direct evidenceof damage. Suspicious indications were,seen and attacked in the same area in;the afternoon.
Submarines were seen three times in the Southern part of the North Sea,one on the 19th and two on the 21st May. Before dawn on the 20th May abattleship and some destroyers were seen lying off Norderney, and four destroyers were under way in the same area later in the morning. The following night two destroyers were present in the Norderney anchorage. In the evening of the20th May a formation of eight M.T.B.&apos;s was found off Texel by three Ansons,which dived on them and bombed and machine-gunned them from about 600 feet.One boat was straddled by a salvo of bombs. One Anson was slightly damaged by anti-aircraft fire and another failed to return. During the following day(21st May) our aircraft sighted in the same area a rubber boat with threeairmen in it, who may well have been the missing crew. Seven M.T.B.&apos;s were again seen, but a second attempt to find them with a. striking force of bomberswas unsuccessful. On the 20th May a small patrol vessel was found in the Bight,bearing Danish markings and flying the swastika flag; its bows were stove inby a near miss, and the crew took to the boats, leaving the vessel in a sinkingcondition. Eight enemy armed trawlers were attacked by Hudsons off Horns Reefon the 22nd May; twelve 250 lb. bombs were dropped, some of which fell close,but no direct hits are claimed.48. Minelaying off the Dutch coast was carried out successfully by sixSwordfish on the 18th-19th May, by six on the 19th-20th May, by six on the20th-21st May and by ten on the 21st-22nd May.  One aircraft failed to return.49. There has throughout the week been considerable reconnaissance andprotective patrol activity between the English and Belgian coasts, and a closewatch has been kept on the movements of shipping in that area. During thesepatrols there have been several encounters with enemy aircraft, in the courseof which two Messerschmitt 110&apos;s have been shot down.French Air Operations.50. Details of the part played by the French Air Force on the western front have not yet been received, though it is known that they have been veryactively engaged during the past week in bombing and reconnaissance operations and that their fighters have had numerous successes. The statistics for combatsfrom the 10th to the 13th May show 78 enemy aircraft destroyed, with a further22 unconfirmed.AIR INTELLIGENCE.German Air Operations.51. No full record can be given of the intensive activities of the German AirForce in the Western campaign. It has, however, been continuously active in thefield both in close support and in bombing communications, and attacks on our aerodromes have continued, though they do not appear to have had any decisiveeffect. An offensive against the Channel ports has developed during the weekand Havre, Boulogne, Dieppe and Calais have all been heavily attacked. Therehas been persistent minelaying at night in the approaches to these ports, and toa lesser extent off the English coast. Shipping has also been frequently attacked and several naval units have been damaged.52. Four long-range bomber Geschwaders were withdrawn from operations at the beginning of the week, presumably to reorganise, but since that time thescale of effort has steadily increased and all long-range and practically all short-range bomber units are now engaged, some of them from advanced aerodromes in holland and Belgium. Some units of transport aircraft have, however, been moved from North-West Germany to the Baltic coast.53. On the 19th May about 140 bombers and 60 fighters were seen on the aerodrome at Vaernes, near Trondhjem, and at that date at least part of threelong-range bomber Geschwaders were known to be operating in Norway. Ourreconnaissance and bombing aircraft have been little hampered by enemy fighters,but very intensive bombing has continued in the Narvik area, and is known tohave done damage to shipping.[21314] d
54. The total confirmed German aircraft losses during the period from9th to 21st May are 991. This figure does not include any German aircraft destroyed by the B.A.F.F. during the last four days of the period, as no completereports have yet been received. It is estimated, however, that 1,464 german aircraft have been lost or damaged since the 10th May.Italy.55. It is now fairly certain that there are no balloons available in italy of a type which could be used for barrage purposes. It is therefore probablethat in the early stages of a war Italian industrial centres would not be protected by balloon barrages, and that such protection could only be provided with Germanassistance.Measures of mobilisation proceed both in Libya and in Italian East Africa.Leave has been stopped and stores of bombs and ammunition are apparently being brought into a state of complete readiness.Spain.56. Preparations continue for the defence of the Balearics. Five Me. 109&apos;sand three He. lll&apos;s have arrived in Majorca, and there are reports of the arrival of fairly large quantities of war material at Majorca and Minorca. Therehave apparently also been certain preparations in Iviza, the smallest island ofthe group, and work is proceeding on improving the landing ground at Salinasthere. There are also unconfirmed reports that a number of members of theGerman Condor Legion, which operated in Spain during the Civil War, havenow returned to the country.Eastern Europe.57. Yugoslavia. On the 17th May the Yugoslav Air Force and anti-aircraft personnel were at their war stations and all Air Force reservists had been called up.   These measures are, however, not officially described as mobilisation.58. Roumania. Some, time since it was reported that the RoumanianGeneral Staff had asked for funds for the construction of at least 200 aerodromes and landing grounds. Landing grounds can be found without difficulty almostanywhere in the plains in the Southern and Eastern part of the country, andthere is no doubt that their number is steadily increasing. At the present moment the location of 189 aerodromes and landing grounds is known to us.Iran.59. The negotiations between the United States and the Iranian Govern-ment, in the course of which the substitution of American for British personnelat the Teheran Aircraft Factory was suggested, have not so far made much progress; and the Iranian attitude on this point appears to be somewhat firmer.It is possible that this change of attitude was due to the British decision to supplyIran with three Blenheims from our stocks in the Middle East as soon as possible,with an undertaking to provide nine more Blenheims if the situation permits.
