(40) 108th Conclusions, Minute 13) agreed -&apos;(5)    That arrangements should at once be madefor the British and French Staffs toprepare an up-to-date statement ofthe military action, which it would beopen to the Allies to- take in the eventof their becoming involved in a warwith Italy&quot;.   .2. In accordance with the above   conclusion discussions have taken place between the British and French representative on the Allied Military Committee covering the whole range of military action in the event of war with Italy, and a comprehensive summary of Allied military intentions hasbeen drawn up Q4. We have examined this summary, which is a document of some lengthy and have authorised thadespatch of a telegram to the Commanders-in-Chief.in the Middle East informing them of the salient points9-1-COS (Mc.Kenna^SSv^

and instructing them to concert plans with the French onthe basis of the policy agreed upon between the French4-and British Staffs.     A copy of the telegram   to the commanders-in-Chief is attached.     We have thought it right to issue these instructions to the Commanders-in-Chief in anticipation of the approval of the Cabinet,owing to the   rapid deterioration of the situationvis-a-vis Italy.5* There is one outstanding question of great importance,which requires decision, namely the question of air attack against Italian industries in North West Italy.6. In this connection it will be recalled that, at the9th Meeting of the Supreme War Council, discussion tookplace as to the best way of striking a sharp and effectiveblow at Italy, and it was agreed that air attack on herindustries in the North West offered the best means to thisend.The supreme War Council&quot; --&quot;(2) Agreed that the French and British governments should consider the question whether, ifthe Allies&apos; found themselves at war, with italy as a result of eithar (a) an Italianattack against them or (b) an Italian act &apos;of aggression wMch they folt bound to resist.military objectives in North West Italy should-immediately be attacked by the air fromaerodromes in France;    and that, as a pre-liminary step, the French and British AirStaffs should consider what aerodromes wouldbe used for this purpose, and should con-cert a plan&quot;.+ Annex.-2-

7o Discussions between the French and British AirStaffs have been carried out, and plans were in courseof preparation when the present offensive on the western front opened.    It is unlikely that British squadronscould be made available in present circumstances, andthe French have saia that they will not undertakethese operations except by way of retaliation, although this attitude may have been changed by recent events.3.&apos;        We suggest that this is a natter which should betaken up with the French Government as a matter of great. - .urgency.(Signed)    G.; La N,  NEWALL.if DUDLEY POUND,i: EDMUND IRONSIDE.NOTE - At the request of the Chief of the AirStaff certain amendments have been madeto paragraph 4 nf the telegram to theCommander:s-in-Chief&quot; and this paragraphjjtg. now shown in the -innex incorporates&apos; tfrsse r^enp^e/ntSj.____The Chief of NavalIffrnrf f * ^nd Chief of.....the .

ANNEXTELEGRAM TO COMMANDERS-IN-CHIEF PROM . CHIEFS OF STAFF.Following for three Commanders-in- Chief fromChiefs of Staff.1. Following is summary of concerted views of Britishand French High Commands based on discussions with French on allied Military action in the event of war- with Italy.2. In general, French agree with British intentions9which have been communicated to you from time to time, butthe French proposals go further, in particular they suggest(a) Occupation of Melos and if possible Lialamis,Navarino and Argostolii(b) Landing of limited forces at Salonika!(c) Early operations against Dodecanese,  although they regard recapture of Balearics as priorrequirement if Italians occupy latter, about which they express much concern.3. Both High Commands agree as to paramount importanceof denying Crete to Italians and affording maximum practicablesupport to Turkey.4. Principal outstanding question which requires decisionbetween two Governments is air attack on Italian war industriesfrom south east France.     Apart from other considerations weconsider that air attack on Italy should materially relieve airpressure in Eastern Mediterranean.     Plans and preparations forthis were in hand when the present offensive on the western front opened.      It is unlikely that British squadrons could bemade available in present circumstances, and-the French have said they will not undertake it except in retaliation, though this attitude may have been changed by recent events.     Neverthe-less, we will keep possibility of such operations in view and inform you of any further developments.5. Discussions have made it clear that large-scale Frenchoffensive from Tunisia is not intended in early stages, andFrench have stated that even local offensive operations wouldbe conditional on direct British air support.     This support will clearly be impracticable.6. Salonika.      If Italy attacks Yugoslavia but is not at warwith Allies, French propose to land advanced guard with aircraft and A.A. defences, size of force not stated.     They appreciate that this might itself lead to war with Italy, in which case theyenvisage force living on country with help of overland or coastwisesupplies through Turkey.      In last resort, force would be- withdrawnoverland to Turkish. Thraceo     If Allies are already at war beforefbrce lands, French propose landing a token force of few thousandmen at Salonika, although they have not made it clear how -chiswould be effected.      They also state that force would live oncountry without supplies from outside.

7. &apos;       French would themselves supply troops for Salonika,also fighter aircraft and A.A. guns, although latter arestill in France,     They state British suppoi&quot;t would bewelsome, and ask us at least to provide R.B.F.. facilities,8. French hold strongly that presence of Allied force at Salonika in above circumstances would.have suchimportant political consequences that it should be attempteddespite risks. From military point of view, we considerproject unsound, but we recognise that it would bo mainlya French commitment09. Support of Turkey.      French undertake.tn providetroops r:ver Anatolian railway, but consider we shouldsupply tanks, A/T units and artillery, and greater part of aircraft and A.A. defences.10.       Similarly., they ask us&apos; to   contribute aircraft andA.A- defences for occupation of Greek Islands and bases.We understand landings would be effected from Frenchcruisers, possibly before Italy declared war if Greeksconsentedo     The political advisability of doing this hasnot yet been discussed,11.       Same limiting factor has constantly arisen in discussions;    namely, availability of resources in relationto Allied intentions.     We feel there would be grave danger in dispersing limited Allied resources to extentinvolved in full French proposals, and it is abundantly clear that no resources -involving aircraft, or A.A. gunscan be made available from  France .)r United-Kingdom n.tpresent juncture.,12.       We consider that C^nraanders-in-Chief are in best position to judge what risks can be accepted and to assesshow resources in.Middle East can best be used.   You should,therefore, discuss whole position with Weygand, concertplans and report broadly your proposed action,13.        In this connection we invite your special attentionto support of Turkey in the event of German advance combined with Italian hostility.    This would appear to be thegreatest danger with which Allied interests xn theMediterranean may be faced.     Under these circumstances weconsider dex0ence of Turkish front must turn very largely-on provision of air security, without which it seems doubtful whether Turks could hold forward of Straxts.
