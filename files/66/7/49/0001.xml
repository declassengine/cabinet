SECRET.v..P. (40)169.(Also Paper No..C.0.S.(40)  597)\/AR CABINET,26TH may 1940.BRITISH STRATEGY IN THE NEAR FUTURE.Report by the Chiefs of Staff Committee.v;e have reviewed our Report on &quot;British Strategy ina Certain Eventuality&quot; (Paper No. W.P.   (40) 168) in thelight of the following Terms of Reference remitted to us by the Prime Minister.&quot;In the event of France being unable to continue inthe war and becoming neutral with the Germans holdingtheir present position and the Belgian army being forced tocapitulate after assisting the British Expeditionary force to reach the coast;    in the event of terms being offered to Britain which would place her entirely at the mercyof Germany through disarmament, cession of naval b s.sgs xxithe Orkneys etc;    what are the prospects of our continuing the war alone against Germany and probably Italy.    can the Navy and the Air Force hold out reasonable hopes of preventing serious invasion, and could the forces gatheredin this Island cope with raids from the air involvingdetachments not greater than 10,000 men;    it being observedthat a prolongation of British resistance might be very dangerous for Germany engaged in holding down the greaterpart of Europe.&quot;2. Our conclusions are contained in the following paragraphs.-1-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT      &quot; 0 "to  BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AMD KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.

5 -        While   our air force is in &quot;being, our Navy andair force together should be able to prevent Germanycarrying out a serious seaborne invasion of thiscountry.4. Supposing Germany gained complete air superiority,we consider that the Navy could hold up an invasionfor a time, but not for an indefinite period.5.        If with our Navy unable to prevent it and our air force gone, Germany attempted an invasion, ourcoast and beach defences could not prevent Germantanks and infantry getting a firm footing on our shores.In the circumstances envisaged above our land forces would be insufficient to deal with a serious invasion.6.        The crux of the matter is air superiority OnceGermany  had attained this, she might attempt to sub-jugate this country by air attack alone.7-        Germany could not gain complete air superiorityunless she could knock out our   air force, and theaircraft industries, some vital portions of whichare concentrated at Coventry and Birmingham.8. Air attacks on the aircraft factories would bemade by day or by night. We consider that we should beable to inflict such casualties on the enemy by dayas to prevent serious damage.      Whatever we do, how-ever, by way of defensive measures and we are pressing on with these with all despatch, we cannotbe sure of protecting the large industrial centres, uponwhich our aircraft industries depend, from seriousmaterial damage by night attack.     The enemy wouldnot have to employ precision bombing to achieve this effect.

o,,.       Whether the attacks succeed in eliminating theaircraft industry depends not only on the material damage by bombs but on the moral effect on the workpeople and their determination to carry on in the face of wholesale havoc and destruction.10.       If therefore the enemy presses home night attacks on our aircraft industry, he is likely to achieve such material and moral damage within theindustrial area concerned as to bring all work to astandstills\\\/

11.       It must be remembered that numerically the germans have a superiority of four to one,.   Moreover, the german aircraft factories are well dispersed and relativelyInaccessible.12*       On the other hand, so long as we have a counter-offensive bomber force, we can carry out similar attacks on German industrial centres and by moral and materialeffect bring a proportion of them to a stand-still.15*       To sum up, our conclusion is that prima facie. germany has most of the cardsj    but the real test is whether the morale of our fighting personnel and civil population willcounter balance the numerical and material advantages which Germany enjoys.   We believe it will.J.G. DILL. (Signed)      C.L.N. NEWALL.T.S.V.    PHILLIPS. DUDLEY POUND.R.E.C. PEIRSE.
