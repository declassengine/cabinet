At our meeting this morning 4th May. we consideredTelegram No. 2314/2nd May from F 0. i/c Narvik (Enclosure).In view of the points raised in Lord Cork&apos;telegram, we think it is necessary to obtain the approvalof the War Cabinet to our conception of the object of the narvik operations.We consider the object of the Allied governments is.--tc secure and maintain a base in northern norway from which we can:-(a) deny iron ore supplies to Germany viaNarvik.(b) interfere so far as may be possible withore supplies to Germany from Lulea.(c) preserve a part of Norway as a seet ofGovernment for the Norwegian Kimg and people.2. We think it important that the object of our operations shotild be clearly defined since General Auchinlecfcis leaving for Narvik in the very near future, and his instructions should be prepared in accordance with theobject laid down by His Majesty&apos;s Government.(Signed)    C.N.L.

It is understood 30,000 men may besent and large camp organizations will have to be built.Role of this force might be (i) to occupy Gabliware Ore field,(ii) Protect Northern Norway against aggression (iii) operate against enemy in middle ^nd Southern Norwaye as railway, only practicable line of communication and NarvikHarbour must take long time to repair and it may beanticipated that before this is effected enemy will captureOre field from Baltic or will destroy Railway in Sweden,(ii) Y/ould require no addition to the present force with existing Military Headquarters and Naval Base Staff,(iii) Would in my opinion require a journey-at staff to plan the advance and landing and the appointment of a GeneralOfficer to command troops in Scandinavia..(i) May be ruled out for a long time to come,2314/2,.
