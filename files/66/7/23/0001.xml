It was suggestedthat from their point of view this would he a far more satisfactory operation.2. The War Cabinet -(i) invited the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to instruct His &quot;Ma3e.styrts Minister,.The Hague;, to inform the netherlands government of the report which we hadreceived of a threatened attack by germany on the Netherland Islands from Texel east-wards;    to enquire whether they had ar.yreason to anticipate such an attack;    and what measures they proposed to meet it,(ii) Agreed that an attack by Germany on the-Netherland Islands would constitute &quot;aGerman aggression against Holland&quot;&apos; (ResolutionIV of the 8th Meeting of the Supreme WarCouncil), and that in the event of a german attack on the Netherland Islands, theRoyal Air Force would be free immediately to attack marshalling yards and oil refineries in the Ruhr,(iii) Invited the Chiefs of Staff Committee toexamine in the light of (ii) what action should be taken in the event of a german attack on the Netherland Islands.j6     W.M.

1 u l)3. In accordance with the above terns of reference the followjing&apos;report has been prepared&apos;.k-. At the meeting of the Supreme T7ar Council held on23rd April it was decided that if the Germans invadedHolland, Allied action would be as follows:-(a) Immediate advance into Belgixun by theAllied armies c(b) Immediate air attack by the British AirForce on marshalling yards and oil installations in the Ruhr area.It has also been agreed that,  if Germany demandsthe cession of bases,  and Holland capitulates, thesituation v/ould be the same as if a German invasion of holland had taken place.5* Recent study of German aims in relation to the scandinavian campaign has led to the conclusions that itis probable that this move is a first step in a Germanattempt to finish the war this year,  and that their mostprobable course of action would be intensive air attack-on Great Britain followed possibly by invasion. Themain orrensive might be directed, against Great Britainand the French might be left relatively alone, their airforces being contained by Italy,6, It has always been recognised that a most importantpreliminary to the attack on Great Britain would be theoccupation of Holland,     Once Holland v/as occupied, and weconsider that the occupation of the ITetherland islands would be merely the first step in this direction, not only would Germany be able to deploy her dive bomber force against this country, but she would also be able to useher short range fighters  in conjunction with her bombers.She would also be able to use her air transport fleet,-escorted by her long range fighters, for conveying an airlanding force and she would obtain bases within 3-4 hourssteaming of our South-eastern coast.    Finally-she would obtain most valuable depth for the defence of her most vulnerable area, the Ruhr.It is therefore vital    to use all our forces todispute the^b&quot;c-gu.pation of Holland,55     F,0o Telegram 12+5 6f--20th Aprilfrom Paris,t     C0oS.(40)310(j,p,.)(s).

7. The moment the Germans move against the NetherlandsIslands, therefore,. we consider that:-(a) Air action should he initiated against objectives in Germany, on the &quot;basis of agreed plans.(h) The Allied armies should advance into Belgiumin accordance with existing plans,(c) Naval forces and medium bombers should attackpoints of landing and enemy transports.Air Action,8. If the situation under consideration arose duringthe next two weeks when there is no moon, our bomberswould admittedly he subject to a certain handicap owingto the difficulty of identifying targets.    Nevertheless,we consider it would he essential to attack.To delay doing so would at once leave the initiativeto the enemy ... ;id would enable them to consolidate their position unhindered.      Further it would avail us nothing to refrain on the score of the inevitable retaliation..On the assumption referred to in paragraph 5 above,  air attack in the relatively near future is a certainty,and we should only be worse off for any delay in itsinception,      Moreover,  if German plans are dislocated intheir early stages,  their prospects of success are livelyto he seriously affected;      the proposed air actionagainst the Ruhr should be a valuable way of dislocatingthe invasion,,Minelaying;,9. Naval action has already been taken by minelayingin the mouths of the Elbe, Jade-v/eser and Ems,    It isprobable that this action has already achieved some success as an 0,I,C, report of 2nd May indicates that allshipping in the Ems has been stopped,      We recommend- thatour minelaying effort should be intensified in these areas and that aircraft should continue to be made available forthis purpose.Magnetic mines will also he required for operation&quot;Paul&quot;,      This operation cannot be carried out for some weeks and it is recommended that it should now he considered as of secondary importance to the mining cfGerman west coast ports and thus make additional minesavailable that were previously earmarked for Lulea,Certain Squadrons of the Royal Air Force ?nd theFleet Air  irm are at present engaged in minelaying operation in the event of r German move against the Bute? islands theimportance of these squadrons,equipped with torpedoes as a striking force might be great, and arrangements to this endare comple-ce,

Redistribution of Naval Forces,10. It is essential that Naval Forces shall he availablefor immediate attack on enemy movement of troops by sja,To this end a redistribution df Naval forces is necessary as our existing forces on the East coast are very weak.The whole of the Home Fleet is now engaged in norwegian waters.      The completion of evacuation of Aandalsnes andNamsos areas will improve the situation, but even then allforces will he employed establishing our position at Narvik,This includes the use of aircraft carriers which will berequired until shore-based aircraft are operating.    Anyredistribution of forces will therefore reduce the extentof naval support to our operations at Narvik,    nevertheless we  recommend a   strengthening of our naval forces on theEast Coast immediately the situation in Central Norwaypermits.Dutch Naval Action.11, Holland has already laid mines in the vicinity of&quot;the Coast.      We recommend that an approach should he madeto the Dutch to intensify this action and that the ..necessary forces to carry out operations to back up theseminefields (Operation C,B.) should be kept in readiness.Other Action.12* As soon as a German move takes places, we re com. end that the various plans already prepared to deny Dutch and belgian resources,to the enemy should be put into immediate effect, and operation &quot;Royal Marine&quot; should be carried out.When the Allied, armies advance into belgium, it will also be necessary to putinto action operation &quot;F.A.&quot;  (Naval support to the leftwing of the French advance through Belgium).Sunimary and Conclusions,13. The occupation of the Netherland Islands would,we consider, he merely the first step in a German occupationof Holland.      We therefore recommend that the- moment theGermans move:-(a) air action should he initiated against objectives in Germany, on the basis of agreed plans.(h)  the Allied armies should advance into Belgiumin accordance with escisting plans.(c) Naval forces ^nd medium bombers should attackpoints of landing and enemy transports.(d) the various plans already prepared to deny dutch and Belgian resources to the enemy should beput into immediate effect,(e) the Royal Marine operation should he carried out.

i 0 &quot;)10 Jlh. In view of the probability of a German move againstHolland in one form or another, we recommend:--(a) our minelaying effort in the-area of thoDutch Coast.should be intensified.(b) as soon as the situation in Central Norwaypermits our Naval forces on the East Coastshould be strengthened.(Signed)    C.L.N.
