THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.SECRET.W.P.(40)16120TH MAY. 1940.WAR CABINET.SUPPLY OF AIRCRAFT TO CANADA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Alre1.        The w.p  Cabinet at their 187th meeting on the 16thMay, 1940, agreed that the proposal to hold up the flow of battle and Anson aircraft which wo have undertaken to send to canada for the Empire Air Training Scheme should be further discussed by the Ministers concerned at a meeting under thechairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal.    The further meeting was &quot;held, the same day, and after the arguments had been stated,the Lord Privy Seal recorded his conclusion that the delivery of these aircraft to Canada should be allowed to proceed for . The Minister of Aircraft Production could not accept this ruling and decided to raise the matter again with theWar Cabinet. A Memorandum (Paper No. W.P.(40)160) setting out his views has since been circulated.3. Before dealing with the Minister&apos;s Memorandum one point of principle arises.   As I understand the matter, theMinister of Aircract Production is responsible for the delivery to the Royal Air Force .of aircraft fit to fight.   The mannerin which aircraft are employed after delivery is theresponsibility of my Department.   While I think it important that the War Cabinet should endorse this point of principleI do not propose to stand on this argument in the presentdiscussion.4.        The arguments in favour of continuing these shipmentswere clearly explained by the Lord Privy Seal in the followingtermsti(a) The necessity for the maintenance of a supply of trained flying personnel.(b) That conditions in this country might make flying training difficult in the near future.(c) That there were ample Anson and Battle aircrafteither in reserve or in production in thiscountry.(d) That the machines destined for Canada wereequipped for training and would have to be re-adapted by the addition of operationalcomponents before they could be used inactive squadrons in this country.1 -o copy NO.  &quot;-\J

(e) That, while recognising the need for bringing into play all our effective aircraft, the gain to he expected from the small number of machinesinvolved in this proposal was insufficient to outweigh the other factors,,1&apos;5. These arguments may he amplified as follows:-(i) The total numbers of Battle and Anson aircraftavailable at the moment are considerable.     Evenif we hold up these exports to Canada, it isdoubtful whether the aircraft would be used inthe immediate emergency we now contemplate.(ii) Battle and Anson aircraft are types of moderateoperational value0      The Anson carries a smallbomb load, and Battles In France have done goodworlc but at groat co-st (iii) The labour involved in getting the Battles ready for shipment is concentrated in the PackingDepot (which is specially organised and mannedfor packing) and the effort involved does not conflict with the other calls on the maintenanceorganisation of the The Ansons arepacked by the contractorso(iv) Battles and Ansons being sent to Canada do not require any items of equipment of which there isa shortageo(v) On the other hand., if the Battles and Ansons were&apos;  &apos;      to be made ready for operation here,; they v/ouldrequire items of equipment which are In short supply and could better be used to equip more -efficient aircraft06. It has been suggested that if these aircraft werestopped, they could be speedily/ replaced in Canada by pvirehasefrom the United States0     In fact, however, the availability of engines is the limiting factor in American aircraft productionand available resources for engine manufacture are alreadyfully xxLedged to the Anglo-French scheme0      But even ifcapacity existed and a suitab3 e type of aircraft could befound, serious delay in meetii^, the requirement would be inevitable.7. To sum up, the operational, gain from stopping theseshi-pments is small0      The potential value to the training programme of proceeding with them is large.     It is important that we should be able to use any lull in operations for thepurpose of building up our strength0     This can only be done if extensive training facilities exist In safe areas.     Thus,while I appreciate the force of the Minister&apos;s arguments, i feel it right, on balance, that the shipments should proceed.(Intld.)       A. S.Air Ministry,
