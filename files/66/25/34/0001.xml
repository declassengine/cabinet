THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government most SECRET. Copy No.&quot; to BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.MEETING WITH THE SOVIET DELEGATION AT No. 10DOWNING STREET AT NOON ON JUNE 9, 1942.Present:The Prime Minister. M. Molotov.Mr. Attlee. M. Maisky.Mr. Eden. M. Soboiev.Sir Alexander Cadogan. M. Pavlov.Brigadier Firebrace.M. MOLOTOV said that he wished to give information about his conversations in Washington and to revert to some points which we had discussed before he left for America.With reference to the treaty we had signed, he was glad to say that theattitude of the American Government and of Mr. Roosevelt had been favourable.Mr. Roosevelt himself had said that he was glad there were no questions of frontiers in the treaty.The question of the second front had been the principal question discussed at Washington as it had been the principal question here. He said he wouldhand over a communique which had been drawn up in Washington regarding their conversations, which would be published after his return to Moscow.Regarding the second front, he wished to say that the question of theestablishment of such.a front in the-summer or autumn of this year was theprincipal question which interested him and his Government. During his conversations with Mr. Roosevelt on the question of the second front, general marshall and Admiral King had been present. Mr. Roosevelt had sympathisedwith him in his desire for the creation of a second front and General Marshallwas,of the same opinion. Mr. Roosevelt had stated that the question was beingconsidered with the British Government and could only be considered togetherwith them as more depended on Great Britain than on the United States.Mr. Roosevelt agreed with his view that it was important to open a second front in 1942 and also with his view that the postponement of the second front to 1943did not necessarily mean that, it would then be easier. If it should happen andhe could not exclude the possibility that they could not stand up to the german attack, they would not have the same strength in 1943 and would not be able to contain so many German divisions. If Hitler had a success in.the Caucasus and reached Baku, he would then be much stronger. If they failed to hold the enemy,Hitler would be much stronger and the formation of a second front in 1943 wouldbe much more difficult. He therefore asked the British Government to considerthe formation of a second front in 1942.11723-8   [23945]B
M. Molotov said that President Roosevelt had the idea of facilitating theestablishment of a second front by making a cut in Russian requirements oftonnage. He had given the President figures of the Russian requirements fromthe 1st July, 1942. to the 1st July, 1943. These would necessitate the utilisation of 8 million tons of shipping. For the supplies to be furnished under the Protocolagreed by the United States Government 4,400,000 tons of shipping would berequired. Of this, only 2 million tons would be carrying war material destined for the front. The President had said that a reduction in these claims would facilitate the establishment of a second front, and General Marshall had endorsedthis, emphasising that the main difficulty in the way of a second front was constituted by the tonnage position. Also by the question of the supply 0faircraft which would be required and of which considerable quantities were tobe supplied to the Soviet Union.M. Molotov said that while in Washington he was unable to express an opinion on this proposed cut in tonnage, but since he had arrived in this countryhe had received a message to the effect that, if the United States Government andHis Majesty&apos;s Government would consider the establishment of a second front in1942, the Soviet Government would consider a reduction of tonnage.President Roosevelt had spoken of the possibility of landing in the firstinstance six to ten divisions with the necessary air support. He had said thathe would be ready to risk the sacrifice of from 100 to 120 thousand men in thefirst instance even though that might lead to a second Dunkirk.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was certainly not prepared to contemplate such a sacrifice if there were no better prospect than ultimatedisaster.M. MOLOTOV said that he was only quoting what the President had said. .In his own opinion, the landing of six to ten divisions would be ineffective. Itwas necessary to draw 40 enemy divisions off the Russian front. That wouldmean the establishment of a real second front. He hoped to receive from thePrime Minister further explanations before he left England. He offeredcongratulations on the R.A.F. raids on Cologne and Essen, though these, of course,did not quite take the place of a second front. On this latter point he hopedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government could give rather more definite indications oftheir intentions; as he had already said, the Soviet Government considered this in the highest degree essential and the Prime Minister had himself promised tomake a more concrete statement.As regards post-war questions, President Roosevelt had discussed thequestion how peace was to be guaranteed, and in this connection he had suggestedthat the following points were essential. In the first place, it would be necessaryto disarm the aggressor Powers Germany, Italy and Japan. But that alone wasnot sufficient, and it would be necessary to control the armaments of othercountries, such as France, Poland, Roumania, &amp;c., so that armaments would remainonly in the hands of three or four great Powers, namely, Great Britain, the soviet union, the United States, and possibly China, provided a stable centralgovernment were maintained in that country. The President had said that these forces would be in the nature of International Police Forces, without which, as thepresent war had shown, peace could not be maintained. The Soviet Governmententirely endorsed this point of view.THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether it was contemplated that thereshould no more be a French army. Whether, for instance, the Spain of Francoshould be armed and France disarmed ?M. MOLOTOV said that these matters had not been discussed in detail.  Heimagined that Spain also should be disarmed.&apos; THE PRIME MINISTER enquired whether we were to contemplate after this war was over going to war with Spain to ensure her disarmament.M. MOLOTOV said that he did not suppose we should wish to go as faras that.  He repeated that the matter had not been discussed on a practical basis.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in his view all these questions wouldhave to be settled at the peace conference.
OContinuing, M. MOLOTOV said that the President had spoken also of certainisland territories in the Pacific, namely, the Japanese mandated islands, the dutch east Indies and also Indo-China. These territories, in his view, should not remain under any single control, but should be administered by two or three governments.THE PRIME MINISTER said that account would have to be taken of theviews of the Netherlands Government in regard to the Dutch East Indies.M. MOLOTOV said that he was merely repeating a general proposition putforward by the President. It. seemed that General Chiang Kai-shek had given-expression to a similar opinion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if he did not discuss these questionshere and now he hoped that M. Molotov would not take his silence to meanconsent. .M. MOLOTOV enquired whether that meant that the Prime Minister didnot agree with these propositions, to which the PRIME MINISTER repliedthat he would not look at any of them.M. MOLOTOV enquired whether that applied to the idea of the Inter-national Police Force as well as to the fate of the Pacific territories.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that the former question would have tobe considered by all the nations who would be expected to contribute to thescheme.Regarding the question of supplies to the Soviet Union, M. MOLOTOV saidthat President Roosevelt had submitted a protocol of the supplies to be furnished by the United States and Great Britain from the 1st July, 1942, to the1st July, 1943. He himself had had no time to examine the figures closely, but it seemed to him to emerge therefrom that the supplies from Great Britain wouldbe maintained on the level of the original protocol. He was surprised at this and would like an explanation as he had understood that Lord Beaverbrook had promised that Great Britain would be able to increase supplies of both aircraft and tanks by 50 per cent, from the 1st July, 1942, and by another 50 per cent,from the 1st January next. M. Molotov would be very grateful if the PrimeMinister could give him, before his departure, a statement regarding thepossibility of increasing the supply of tanks and aircraft and especially ofValentines.THE PRIME MINISTER thanked M. Molotov for the information whichhe had supplied regarding his conversations with the President.With regard to post-war questions, what M. Molotov had reported showed that the important thing was to win the victory first rather than, before it waswon, to dispute how the advantages were ultimately to. be^shared. Clearly allthese questions would have to be settled at the peace conference. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, for their part, adhered to their resolve that Germany must be rendered incapable of further mischief. She must be effectively disarmed and kept disarmed. And the question of the frontiers of Germany must be considered in that connection. But it would be a great mistake to try now to decide whatwas to happen to all the other countries involved in the war and the neutral countries. He would himself have consultation with President Roosevelt in thematter.As regards the question of the supply of war material to Russia, the PrimeMinister explained that the Protocol which was handed to M. Molotov by president Roosevelt represented the best that His Majesty&apos;s Government could do in present circumstances. It was quite true that Lord Beaverbrook had promised certain later increases, but he must observe that there Avas a provision in the original Moscow Protocol to the effect that if new circumstances arose thesituation must be reconsidered. There was a new circumstance in the Japaneseattack, which had fallen mainly on the British Empire. This had necessitatedgreat diversions of troops and supplies. Troops destined for the Levant front had been sent to India and Australia; also great quantities of supplies, includingtanks and aircraft. Moreover, the Americans had had to draw largely on thesupplies originally earmarked for this country in order to equip their own forces[23945] b 2
and help to defend Australia. The result was that almost all the supplies that america sent to Russia came out of the allotment that we had expected for thiscountry. His Majesty&apos;s Government readily accepted this situation, but the fact remained that, owing to our finding ourselves opposed by another first-classantagonist, very large deductions had been made from the American allotmentsto this country. The Protocol represented the best that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment could do at the present moment; they would like to do more, as they knewto what good use the Russians would put this material, and they certainly would do more if it became possible.M. MAISKY referred to a letter from Lord Beaverbrook written in march last, which was some time subsequent to the entry of Japan into the war.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had no knowledge of this letter.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that there was another feature whichhad proved to our disadvantage, and that was the building up of the UnitedStates Air Force and Army. These were not yet fully in action, but their equip-ment drew heavily on the war material output in the United States. For instance,in January last an agreement was made in Washington for the supply to thiscountry of 5,000 aircraft by April 1943. The President now proposed only to let us have 1,000 of these aircraft. If this proposal were accepted, we should lose the possibility of obtaining 4,000 aircraft, for which squadrons would be waiting.The Prime Minister said that he was doing his best to induce the President to reverse or modify this decision, and he did not know what the outcome would be.But this instance showed to what disadvantage we might be put by United Statesrearmament, however much we might welcome that fact, and by the entry of japan into the war.In regard to the question of the second front, the Prime Minister said thatit was very important that the Soviet Government should know exactly wherethey stood. He had had a message from President Roosevelt to the effect that thelatter was forwarding to him certain proposals, but these had not yet beenreceived.Actually at the present time all preparations were being made to attemptto land about six divisions in France in the autumn of this year. shipping would be withdrawn from traffic and every effort would be made to provide facilities in the ports and to increase the supply of landing craft, and allpreparations were being made with a view to rendering possible such a landing.But whether it were to be actually attempted or not must depend on the situationwhen the time came. It was not a question of providing large vessels such asthose used in the Russian convoj^s, but of special landing craft which were necessary to land troops on a coast so strongly defended as was that strip of coastwhich was accessible to British fighter planes. Therefore, he did not see how the Presidents proposal to cut Russian tonnage requirements would help towardsthe solution of the problem involved in effecting a landing on a highly fortifiedstrip of coast. However,, he would, of course, examine carefully the Presidentsproposals when received.The Prime Minister repeated that while all preparations were going forward for an attempted landing on this scale, he must not be taken as promising thatwhen the time came the force would actually be put ashore. The decision toproceed with the operation would only be taken in the light of the situationprevailing when the moment came. He would be very glad to go into the matter in detail and let the British experts explain the position.His Majesty&apos;s Government were also studying the possibility of undertakingan operation in the Far North, in the Petsamo region, if that would be of any interest to the Soviet Government, with whom he would like to discuss the matter.This operation would entail the despatch of a number of fighter squadrons to murmansk beforehand, which could later occupy any airfields captured from thesea. Bombers could then be sent to these airfields from this country. the planning of this operation was highly technical and would have to be discussed in detail with the Soviet staff.So much for 1942. As M. Molotov knew, British and American armies were fully resolved to invade the continent in 1943 to the strength perhaps of 40 or50 divisions, which would increase subsequently to the limit of possibility. Forthis purpose enormous preparations would have to be made.   Incidentally, nearly
a million American soldiers were coming to this country, and preparations werebeing organised so that next year descents might be made on the continent atperhaps six or more different points, and all these plans were being discussed withthe American authorities.The Prime Minister said that he quite understood that there was a danger-point in 1942 and that Germany might be stronger in the west in 1943. Therefore,he would be very glad if it were possible to do in 1942 what was planned todo in 1943. He would like to give M. Molotov orally a detailed explanation why it was not possible to do more than he could promise, but if M. Molotov had toleave London in the near future he could have a written statement prepared.He thought it important that the Soviet Government should be fully informedso that they could know what they might count on and what they could not count on.M. MOLOTOV thanked the Prime Minister for his statement regardingthe possibility of landing six divisions this year and of an operation in the North.The Soviet Government would welcome the latter, but he observed that this wouldnot be the equivalent of a second front.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed.M. MOLOTOV said that his Government were specially interested in thepossibilities of a real second front in 1942.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that there should be a discussion thenext morning on the more technical aspects of the problem of establishing a;second front this year. It was a question of facts and figures and dates, and he invited M. Molotov to bring his General with him.M. MOLOTOV said he wished to put one question to the Prime Minister.The latter had appeared to disagree with what President Roosevelt had said about being ready to risk the sacrifice of 100 to 120 thousand men and to riskanother Dunkirk. At the same time the Prime Minister had indicated thatprepartions were under way for an operation which might involve those risks.THE PRIME MINISTER explained that if when the time came itappeared that so many lives would be uselessly thrown away and that the venturewould end only in another Dunkirk, he himself would not consent to it. Howwould that help Russia ? It could only do the Allies harm and encourageGermany. Wars could not be won by unsuccessful actions. If there were a good prospect of success then it might be necessary to risk considerable sacrifices.Victory was worth any price. But he emphasised the great difficulties of theundertaking. To transport an army across the sea was a very different matterfrom simply moving troops across the land. Moreover, for the operation of landing special equipment and special training were necessary. It would be essential to obtain and maintain control of certain ports where every obstructionwould be placed in our way. Even when landed the expeditionary force couldonly cover a few miles of front on which would be concentrated the whole strengthof the enemy. The undertaking would in fact be a most formidable operation,but if there appeared to be any reasonable prospect of success we would be willingto attempt it. In any case, all the preparations made for this initial attack would still contribute to a larger operation next year.
