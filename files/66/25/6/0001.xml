(42) 148) for carrying through the coal production programme for the year1942-43, the Prime Minister undertook to put in writing certain suggestions for reducing the demand for coal, or for sustaining output, which might make it unnecessary to withdraw ex-miners from Field Force units in the Army at home(W.M. (42) 46th Conclusions, Minute 1).The suggestions communicated to me by the Prime Minister are reproduced in the Appendix to this Memorandum.2. In the light of these suggestions and of the discussion at the War Cabinet,the Lord Presidents Committee have again reviewed the production programme,in consultation with the Ministers concerned. In this review we have takenaccount of new circumstances which modify to some extent the appreciation givenin W.P. (42) 148, viz. :-(a) The previous estimate tended to mask the recent decline in output of cOalper man shift worked. On this account we have framed our newestimate on the basis, not of the additional output of the face workers to be returned to the pits, but of the probable output of the total labour force employed in the industry.(The discussion in the War Cabinet proceeded on the assumptionthat 7,000 miners, whose release from the Field Army was thensuggested, would produce only 2 million tons of coal in a year andthat there would be no need to withdraw these men from the Army ifmeans could be found of reducing consumption by this amount. Infact, if the 7,000 men were face-workers, and could all be re-employed at the coal-face, their production would be nearer 5 million than million tons. But, if the estimate were framed on the basis of theadditional coal likely to be obtained by face workers returned to theindustry, we should also have to assume a correspondingly higher figure for tonnage lost through wastage from the industry.)[b) The War Cabinet are reluctant to authorise the release of ex-miners from field Force units, and are prepared to run some risk of a shortage ofcoal rather than risk impairing the efficiency of the Field Army athome.[23880]
(c) The numbers of ex-miners to be released from non-Field Force units inthe Army, from R.A.F. ground staff and from industry, will be larger than we had assumed when our previous estimate was submitted.3. On the basis that a higher degree of risk is to be accepted, we could make the following cuts in the estimate of production required to meet essential needs : (a) Stocks. On further consideration, the Mines Department are preparedto assume a reduction of stocks to the extent of 2f million tons.This will involve a substantial reduction in colliery stocks, and much of this coal will be of poor quality. It will be necessary for theWar Cabinet to support the Mines Department in compellingconsumers, e.g., Supply Departments, to accept this low quality coal.(b) Fuel economy in industry. The savings to be secured by this meansmight amount to 1 million tons.(c) Exports and foreign bunkers. It is agreed that the estimate for bunkerscould be cut by 200,000 tons.   In addition, I believe that some reduc-tion could be made in the estimates of (i) 630,000 tons for contingencies,and (ii) 660,000 tons for minor exports to miscellaneous destinations.I propose that the estimate for exports should be cut by 750.000tons.(d) Outcrop deposits. It is now estimated that the working of outcropdeposits may yield about 2 million tons of usable coal during the year.(For convenience this is treated here as equivalent to a reductionin consumption, for it reduces the demand for coal produced fromthe mines.)4. By these alterations in the estimates, the target for the year&apos;s production from the mines (making no allowance for the rationing of domestic fuel) is reduced from 215 to 208^ million tons.What labour force is required to produce this output?If efficiency in terms of output per man were the same as during 1941-42,the reduced target could be reached by an average labour force during the year of 708,500 men. Allowing a net wastage of 25,000 during the year, this wouldmean a labour force of 721,000 at 1st May, 1942.But efficiency was falling during 1941-42. Output per man shift workedoverall, which was 1 - 086 tons in the first quarter of 1941, had fallen to 1 -057 tonsin the corresponding period of this year, a fall of 2-6 per cent.If output per shift continues to fall at the same rate during 1942-43, weshould need an average labour force of 726,000 to produce 208^ million tons inthe year. Allowing for wastage, this would mean a labour force of 738,500 atthe 1st May, 1942.We cannot afford to assume that efficiency will continue to decline at this, rate during the coming year. Measures of reorganisation which are now being-considered, though they may not become fully operative during the year, should at least arrest the downward trend of output per shift. I therefore proposethat, for the purpose of the present estimate, we should assume that the output per shift during 1942-43 will, on the average, equal that secured during thefirst quarter of 1942, though it is at present somewhat lower.On this assumption, the reduced target could be reached by an average labour force of 713.000 men. Allowing for wastage, this would mean a force of 725.500at the 1st May, 1942.5. What progress have we made towards raising the labour force to this level ?(a) A rmy. As a result of the decision endorsed by the War Cabinet on the10th April, 6,033 ex-miners had been released from the Army forreturn to the mines up to the 23rd May.The War Office estimate that under the existing decision wemay obtain about 6,500 ex-miners from the Army.(b) R.A.F. The Air Ministry have furnished lists&quot; of 2,700 ex-collieryworkers who might be released from the ground staffs of the R.A.F..i -    It is unlikely, however, that more than&quot; half this number will bereturned for underground employment in the mines. First, these aremen who have indicated their willingness to return to particular
collieries of their own choice. Secondly, the lists include a fairly high proportion of men who are not underground workers, and it is known that collieries Avill not be able to absorb many surface workers. Forthese reasons it is unsafe to assume that more than 1,300 men will beobtained from this source,(c) Industry&apos;.-The Minister of Labour, in consultation with other ministers concerned, has concluded arrangements for releases of coal-faceworkers from industry and Civil Defence which could result in thereturn of a maximum number of 4,025 ex-miners to the pits. previous experience suggests that it will not be possible in practice to securethe release of this maximum total; but we may assume that about,500 ex-miners will be obtained from this source.6. If these special steps had not been taken to secure the return of men tothe industry, the labour force would have fallen to 704,000 by-the 1st May, 1942.As a result of these measures, the labour force may be raised to a total of about715.300 men.Not all of these men, however, were at work in the mines at the beginningof the production year on the 1st May indeed, the full numbers will not have returned to the pits for some weeks to come. If allowance is made for this, andfor wastage, it may be said that the measures already taken for the return of ex-miners from the Services and industry will secure an average labour force,during the year, of 702,300 men.On the assumption suggested at the end of paragraph 4 above, this labour force could produce during the year a total of 205-3 million tons of coal repre-senting a deficit of 3 - 2 million tons on the reduced target of 208 - 5 million tons.7. Before considering how this deficit could best be met, we wish to draw attention to some uncertain factors and possible new commitments which mayhave the effect of increasing the gap between production and consumption : (a) The estimate is based on the assumption that output per shift during theyear will, on the average, equal that of ,the first quarter of 1942,notwithstanding that output per man shift declined during 1941-42by 2-6 per cent, and that the decline is still continuing.(b) The programme, as now revised, provides no margin for contingencies. Inthe case of exports, in particular, there can be no guarantee that eventswill not force us to meet new demands for which no provision hasbeen made. For example, we may be compelled, on strategical grounds,to increase our exports to Egypt in order to make good a loss ofsupplies from India which could not be met from other sources. Andit has already been suggested that We should export more coal in shipssailing to North America in ballast, so as to set free American ships now engaged in the coastwise carriage of coal, and so increase the pool of tonnage available for Anglo-American purposes.(c) In addition to these factors of uncertainty, there is a potential newcommitment of which no account has so far been taken. If certain military projects which are now under consideration mature, heavy additional demands for coal are likely to be made for various military purposes during the winter of 1942-43. I need not specify the natureof these demands in detail. The Committee will appreciate that these projects might involve a heavy increase in coal consumption for a variety of reasons; and no provision has so far been made for this inthe production programme.There is the further point that these projects will involve thetemporary withdrawal of a substantial number of vessels from thecoastwise trade, most of which would ordinarily be engaged in thecoal trade. These ships would be withdrawn at a time when an exeep-tionally heavy strain was being placed on the railway system; and, to:meet this, steps will have to be taken in advance to build up substantialstocks in certain areas. This must be done during the summer of 1942,but it can only be done if production during the summer can be main-tained at a level sufficient to provide a surplus after meeting bothcurrent consumption and the amounts required for minimum stocks inother parts of the country.[23880] B 2
8. For the reasons indicated in the preceding paragraph, the deficit against which we have to provide may, in the result, be found to be substantially morethan 3-2 million tons.There are three possible ways of meeting such a deficit: (a) Some economies could be secured through a system of allocating coal to industry analogous to that for allocating raw materials cf. (b)-(d) in theAppendix. The Mines Department are now working out a scheme for makingdefinite allocations to the main coal-consuming industries. Such a scheme will present substantial administrative difficulties, for coal supplies are not under the direct control of the Mines Department to the extent that raw materials are controlled by the Ministry of Supply. The only course open to the department is to work towards such a system progressively by determining the minimum needsof selected industries, one by one, and dealing first with a few of the less essential industries whose coal consumption appears to be excessive.The Department will need the full co-operation of the Supply Departments,and other Departments concerned with particular industries, in determining the allocations to be made; and it will be necessary for the War Cabinet to give specificdirections that all Departments concerned shall collaborate in securing thenecessary economies in industrial consumption.If this system can be brought into effective operation during the summer,even over a limited part of the field, there is a reasonable prospect that substantial economies may be secui&apos;ed during the course of the year. At this stage it is notpossible to frame any reliable estimate of the savings which might be obtained by this means; but they might well amount to more than 1 million tons duringthe year.(b) Full account has not so far been taken of the increase in production which might be expected to result from the proposals for the reorganisation ofthe industry which have been outlined in W.P. (42) 224.It has been assumed (paragraph 4 above) that these measures of reorganisation will serATe to arrest the downward trend of output per shift. Ifthe decline in output per shift continued at its present rate during the AAdiole of1942/43, the effect would be a loss of 4 million tons on the year&apos;s productionassumed in this memorandum. Thus, a substantial contribution has already been assumed on account of reorganisation. If, however, these measures of reorganisation -sation are pressed forward speedily and vigorously, and if they secure theAvhole-hearted support of both sides of the industry, the gain will not be limitedto that directly resulting from the practical measures proposed, e.g., coneen-tration on the more productive pits and seams. The psychological effect of these changes, on workers and managements alike, should also haA^e a considerable effecton output. It is permissible, therefore, to assume that, during the latter part ofthe year, Ave can look not merely to arresting the decline in output per shift, but toa further increase in production.(c) Further economies in consumption could be secured by the rationing of domestic fuel. The full scheme of &quot; points &quot; rationing outlined by thePresident of the Board of Trade in his memorandum W.P. (42) 225 would saveabout 6 million tons in the year, if introduced with effect from the 1st July.9. In these circumstances the Lord Presidents Committee do not wishto press their previous suggestion (W.P. (42) 148) that the labour force of theindustry should be increased by the withdrawal of ex-miners from Field force units in the Army at home.10. The remaining question for decision by the War Cabinet is whetherit is necessary to proceed With the scheme for rationing domestic fuel.In the view of my Committee, the position will be materially altered by theadoption of the reorganisation scheme. It is important to enlist not only good-will, but even enthusiasm, for the successful operation of this&apos; scheme; and wethink it preferable that, at this stage, we should place the emphasis on theincreased production which is likely to be secured through this reorganisation,rather than on bridging the gap by economies to be enforced by a scheme of com-pulsory rationing. This does not mean that We can afford to do withouteconomies in domestic fuel consumption. If we are to close the gap and to provide against the contingencies mentioned in paragraph 7, we must aim at securing, by
voluntary means, reductions in domestic consumption not substantially less thanthose which would be secured under the rationing scheme. The Mines Depart-ment must also proceed with the scheme for allocating coal to industry, with aview to securing the maximum possible reduction in the industrial consumptionof coal.11. My Committee do not, therefore, recommend that the rationing scheme should be introduced at this stage. They think it essential, however, that weshould be ready to ration domestic fuel consumption at short notice; and they therefore recommend that all administrative preparations should be made for theintroduction of the &quot;points&quot; scheme of rationing outlined in W.P. (42) 225.Moreover, they suggest that these preparations should be carried to the stage ofissuing the forms and making the assessments. These steps should be associatedwith an appeal to all members of the public to practise economy in the use ofall forms of fuel. There should be sustained publicity designed to persuadepeople to restrict their fuel consumption, voluntarily, as nearly as practicable to the limits which would be imposed on them if a rationing scheme were introduced.Finally, the Committee recommend that the position should continue to be closely watched, in the light of the output actually secured; and that in any event a special report should be made to the War Cabinet in September nexton the result of the decisions now to be taken.J.

APPENDIX.Minute from the Prime Minister.-Lord President.1. There is general agreement about the proposals in your paper aboutcoal, except for the transfer of 7,000 trained soldiers from the Field Army tothe pits. These 7,000 men, if they produced the same as the average mine-workers, might hew 2,000,000 tons of coal in a year. The effect of such adislocation in the Army at this critical time is so serious that I hope all otheralternatives to find these 2,000,000 tons will be exhausted. There are manyalternatives, it seems to me at first sight, which are less injurious to our general war effort : (a) Drawing from the coal reserve of 12,000,000 tons.(b) Economies might be effected by a system of allocating coal to varioususers such as obtains in other raw materials.(c) Further economies in the War Production Departments(d) Reduction in industrial users other than munitions.(e) A possible reduction in the export programme.(/) Monetary rewards to miners for surrender of a  portion of  theircustomary coal allowance.(g) Directing a large number of untrained youths of 18-19 years into the pits.(h) Persuading or allowing a proportion of ageing men to work for another year.(i) Possible expansion in outcrop working.&apos; (;) Get miners to work an extra 15 minutes a week.With all these possibilities in view, each of which might mean nearly 1,000,000tons a year, there should be no difficulty in finding the 2,000,000 tons, and thusavoiding the injury to the Army.2. Further help will be given by all your long-term projects, including,the financial point about relating E.P.T. to tons mined.3. Meanwhile the War Office are to specify how many miners they have in the Metropolitan Field Force, what proportion are face-workers, and how many of them are with the fighting formations; that is to say, excludingTransport, R.A.S.C., R.A.O.C., and other ancillary services. The War office will of course find the 5,000 men out of the 12,000 asked for, which are to begiven from A.D.G.B. and other Field Force branches.4. I hope all these possibilities will enable us to round the corner without taking the very grave step at this juncture which would derange the solidaritvof the Army. .(Initialled) W. S.
