VSUMMARY OF OPERATIONS OF BOMBER COMMAND for fortnight ENDING 1200 HOURS, SUNDAY, JUNE 7, 1942.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Air.Weather.IN the period covered by this report the weather was favourable, and. apartfrom one night, cloudless conditions prevailed. As is always the case during periods of high atmospheric pressure, however, visibility was considerably reduced, particularly in the Ruhr, by ground haze and industrial smoke.Conditions over home bases were good.Operations.Night GennevilliersCherbourgDieppeCologneEnemy AerodromesCologneEssenEnemy AerodromesEssenBremenEnemy AerodromesDieppeSchipol AerodromeEssenEmdenEnemy AerodromesDay-CologneCologneFlushing Port AreaEssenDieppe Port AreaCherbourg Dock AreaLe Havre Power StationBoulogne   ...DunkirkSchipol AerodromeLe Havre Power StationOstend Power Station   ..Morlaix Aerodrome[23984]29/30 May29/30 ,,29/30 .,30/31 ,,30/31 ,,31 May / 1 June1/ 2    .,1/ 22/ 3&apos;      3/3/4/4/44555/ 66/6/31 May1 June1223 &apos;;,3 ,,4 .,4 ,&apos;,5    ,,555    ,,77 aircraft26221,04048295749196170820131802336521236666616612
Mining. 161 mines were laid during the period under review. During themonth of May the record number of 1,015 mines was laid.Operational Achievements.Night A attacks.Gennevilliers, 29th/30th May.The target was the Gnome et Rhone Aero-Engine works, the neighbouringGoodrich Tyre and Thomson-Houston factories, and the power station supplyingthem all. The raid was very successful, severe damage being caused to all sectionsof the target. The French wireless admitted that the power station was completely destoyed.  A photograph is attached showing the results of this raid.Cologne, 30th/31st May.For the first time in the history of air warfare over 1,000 aircraft were concentrated on one target. This scale of attack was achieved by using, inaddition to the squadrons, a total of 363 aircraft from the operational training-units.Damage seen in Cologne as a result of this raid is on a larger scale than anything yet seen in any German city. It is not yet possible to make a full assess-ment of the damage, but it is certain that practically no part of the city remainsintact. The area of complete destruction amounts to a total of some 600 acres,the largest areas of devastation being in the old city. Reports of the numbersof casualties and homeless vary, but there is no doubt that casualties were heavy,and it is thought that at least 50,000 people were rendered homeless. The effecton public utility services throughout the city must also have been very great. the photographs attached, in which areas of complete destruction or very severe damage are ringed in white, are remarkable for the almost complete absence of vehicles on the streets and activity in the railway stations.Some 250 factory buildings and workshops have been destroyed or seriously damaged. In particular, the Large workshops at the Nippes marshalling yardwere almost totally destroyed.There was also considerable interruption to railway traffic through the city.It has been reported that it was 4 days after the attack before any goods trucksarrived at Basle from Cologne, and by the 6th June only one instead of sixpassenger trains was running daily between these two cities.The success of this attack demonstrated two very important points : (i) that a concentration on the scale attempted has a paralysing effect on theenemy defences with a consequent reduction in the proportion of casulties;(ii) that such an attack produces incomparably more damage, material and moral, than a similar total effort spread over a longer period in aseries of smaller raids.Essen, 1st/2nd June.This was the second raid on a very large scale. The attack was notconcentrated as successfully as at Cologne and resulted in dispersed damage ina number of towns in the Ruhr. Photographs show that at Oberhausen damage was caused on a scale which two or three months ago would have been consideredproof of a very successful raid. Damage to industrial objectives was caused also at Hamborn, Mulheim, Krefeld/Uerdingen and Duisburg.Bremen, 3/&apos;g?/4 A June.Ground haze made identification of aiming points extremely difficult.Photographs show, however, major incidents of damage by fire in buildings and warehouses in the dock areas and in parts of the new town.Emden, Qth/7th June.This attack was very successful. Parts of the naval dockyard have been gutted and severe damage done in the dock area. A large part of the town hasbeen extensively damaged by fire.
Day Attacks.Dieppe. Photographs taken during an attack on the 2nd June show severalbombs bursting on the Quai de Norvege, including two direct hits on the railway lines and cranes, two bombs bursting in the New Dry Dock, and eight in theSte. Franc-Graigola-Merthyr on the south-west side of the New Dry Dock,including a direct hit on the main building.Boidogne. Photographs taken during the attack on the 4th June show ninebombs bursting on buildings to the east of the Quay Gambetta and one on a concentration of small craft alongside the Quay.he Havre. Photographs taken during an attack on the 5th June show adirect hit on the main Power Station building and ten amongst the subsidiarybuildings and buildings to the east and west of the Power Station.Ostend. Photographs taken during the attack on the 5th June show adirect hit on the Power Station with large clouds of black smoke rising from thecentre of the main building. Other bombs are seen bursting on the canal banksand amongst buildings in the vicinity.Flushing. Photographs taken on the 30th May show that during the attackon the 30th April a direct hit demolished the centre of one bay in a four-baybuilding of the De Schelde Co., adjoining the Repairing Dock.Information regarding&quot; Previous Raids.Augsburg. A report has been received of a statement by a civilian engineerwho served in the Commission which inspected the M.A.N. works at Augsburgafter the daylight attack on 17th April. He estimated that at least 5 months would elapse before normal output could be resumed.The Gneisenau. Photographs of Gdynia taken on the 2nd June tend to confirm reports that the battle cruiser Gneisenau suffered severe damage at Kielafter her passage through the Channel. The &quot; A &quot; turret appears to have beenwholly removed, and &quot; B &quot; and &quot; Y &quot; turrets partially so.Gdynia is not a port at which rapid repair could be effected and the movementof the battle cruiser to this port is some indication that she will be out of action for a long time.Mining.Our increased mining effort is being reflected in the number of reports ofships sunk and damaged.In addition to those already reported in previous summaries details of afurther thirteen ships mined since the beginning of May have been received.There is good reason to believe that this is by no means the complete list.A.
