THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT ^Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1942.SECRET. / Copy No.   29W.P. (32) 233.June 1, 1942.WAR CABINET.GENERAL DE GAULLE AND FRENCH OPINION.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I HAVE been impressed by recent testimony to the large amount of support which General de Gaulle enjoys in occupied France.2. A May Day message from the Trade Unionists of France addressedto the workers of the free world, and especially to those of Great Britain,America and Russia, was sent to the International Federation of Trade Unions.It was the first message of its kind from France since the capitulation and itconcluded with these words :&quot; Our country is still at war. Our representative, the representativeof the people of France General de Gaulle fights with the Allies.Although his Army is still small, a huge imprisoned force is behind him inFrance. The enemy will not perhaps always be able to keep this forceenchained.&quot;3. I have received confirmation from other sources that the above represents the feelings of those who are maintaining resistance to the Germans in occupiedFrance. My informants, who belong to Left-wing circles in France, and are inclose touch with the French Trade Unionists, the Christian Syndicalists and themilitant section of the Socialist Party, affirm that resistance to the Germans in occupied France is synonymous with Gaullism, that General de Gaulle is the accepted leader of French resistance, and that the people of France could notrtriderstand how any distinction could be drawn between Gaullism and resistance to the Germans.4. According to my informants there are only two other elements inFrance, namely, Petainism and Communism. Petainism is almost finished;very few supporters of. Petain remain among the anti-collaborators. the communists have had a considerable accession of strength since Russia was brought into the war, and the militant Communists now number about 100,000.5. It is probable that some of the leaders of resistance in France will come to London to join the National Committee. &quot;We are doing what we canto encourage and assist in bringing about this development.6. My informants speak very strongly against the French emigres inLondon and in the United States who display a certain activity but have notjoined the Free French Movement. In London, MM. Comert&quot;(the editor ofFrance), Labarthe (the editor of La France Libre) and Cambon are mentionedwith a certain contempt, particularly M. Labarthe. Among the Frenchmen inAmerica, M. Chautemps comes in for most abuse, but Pierre Cot is also mentioned among those whose encouragement by the United States or ourselveswould have a disastrous effect in France. My informants all say that the old gangof politicians will have no place in the France of the future and that the reinsmust be entrusted to new men.11735   [23895]
7. Their idea is that, when the Allies land iii France, General de Gauliemust come with them and take over Paris at once, promising the people food andgood administration. They declare that this will be the only means of avoidingcivil war in France and of preventing the Communists from seizing power.General de Gaulle need not bring the National Committee with him, as theCommittee meant very little to the French people. The object of bringing newblood from France to join the National Committee would thus be not to strengthen the Committee as such, but to enable a wholesome influence from occupied Franceitself to be established over General de Gaulle himself. Occupied France isregarded as the front line against the Germans, whereas London is definitelyregarded as behind the lines.8. General de Gaulle has given a declaration to the leaders of the Left,organisations in France, with which I gather they are satisfied.9. In view of the oft-repeated allegation that General de Gaulle is a Fascist,my colleagues may be interested to have the above information. It may be discounted to some extent since it comes from enthusiasts who are risking their lives for the cause of France&apos;s liberation from the Germans. But we can at leastconclude that General de Gaulle enjoys the support of the chief organisations which have managed to continue their existence in occupied France and whichare maintaining resistance to the Germans in every way open to them.A.
