(42) 20)and the summary of their conclusions gives a general picture of the situation asregards non-tanker tonnage and import.Summary of Merchant Ship Building.2. This report was concerned only with non-tanker tonnage and we appenda summary of the merchant ship building situation, as far as it is known atpresent, which includes tanker tonnage : (a) Estimated completions of ocean-going vessels in 1942 [Million gross tons)Non-tankers.     Tankers.British (including Dominions)      ......      1-40 - 30United States (on British account)......        - 40Totals (British)    .........      1-80 -30United States (ex British account) ...      ...      3-55 - 805-35 110Grand total         ......... 6-45(b) Estimated completions of ocean-going tonnage in 1943 are largely basedon tentative estimates, but may be assessed approximately as follows : (Million gross tons.)Non-tankers.

3. Since the foregoing estimates were prepared information nas beenreceived from Washington that, realising the vital importance of anti-submarineescort vessels, the United States now propose to turn over one merchant shipyardentirely to building these craft. It is impossible to estimate what will be theeffect of this on the United States building programme because the United Statesyards vary considerably in size, but an enquiry has been addressed to Washington.We assume that this proposal is not expected to result in any reduction in outputof merchant ships in 1942. The resulting reduction in the 1943 output may be substantial, but in our opinion the reduction would probably be more than made good by a saving in sinkings.Losses of Merchant Ship Tonnage.4. The figures given in paragraph 3 (b) of the Shipping Committee&apos;s reportfor the ocean-going non-tanker tonnage operating in British interests and those inparagraphs 22-24 for the United States are derived from the estimate agreed between the Admiralty and the Ministry of War Transport in April last. Thisputs the total losses (including tankers) from all causes for the calendar year1942 in the neighbourhood of 6-5 million gross tons.5. Tables are attached in Appendix I showing the actual losses incurred by enemy action by areas, cause, &amp;c. The U-boat campaign off the east coast ofAmerica began on the 12th January, 1942, and during the five months, january to May, sinkings in the western half of the North Atlantic, including the approaches to Newfoundland and Canadian waters (Table B), have been 63 percent, of the total losses. Losses by mine during this period amount only to2-5 per cent, of the total, and those by aircraft to about 10 per cent., of which themajority were incurred in the Far East. Surface attack has accounted for about-5 per cent., more than half of which resulted from the Japanese incursion intothe Bay of Bengal in April. There has recently been a recrudescence of raideractivity both in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Ocean.Tanker losses have been heavy, amounting to 1,142,000 g.r.t., i.e., rather morethan one-third of the total losses, though the steps taken to restrict and controlsailings and the introduction of convoy in American coastal waters have consider-ably reduced the rate of loss in June.6. It will be seen that the average monthly loss of tanker and non-tanker tonnage from enemy action for the first five months of the year has amounted to approximately 600,000 g.r.t., equivalent to an annual rate of 7  million g.r.t.It is evident that a considerable reduction in this rate of loss must be achieved if the estimate of 6-5 million tons from all causes for the year is not to be exceeded.The institution of the convoy system on the American seaboard in the middleof May and between Trinidad and Aruba a few days later has much reduced the losses on those routes and it is reasonable to expect that the trans-Caribbeanconvoy, which is due to start on the 1st July, will have similar results.On the other hand, experience shows that this is likely to increase the weightof attack in other areas. A reversion to the heavy scale of attack on our atlantic convoys might well result in a high rate of loss, since our escort groups have hadto be weakened to meet our various other commitments.While the effectiveness of the American anti-submarine measures is increasing, the situation is a cause of grave anxiety and is being watched withgreat care.North A atlantic, United States Coast, and Gulf and Caribbean. Extension of convoy System.7. When U-boat attacks began off the East coast of the United States, the americans were completely unprepared to -deal with this form of attack. Atthat time our homeward-bound convoys were receiving escort throughout theirvoyage, but our outward-bound convoys were dispersing about 500 miles short of Halifax. The new attacks created an urgent need for all-through escort andfor anti-submarine forces on the United States seaboard, and United Statesagreement to the necessary reorganisation was achieved early in February. Thedesirability of a convoy system on the United States coast was also represented to the United States authorities, but on the 10th February the Admiralty Delega-tion in Washington reported that anti-submarine forces on the American coast
were quite inadequate for this purpose. It was therefore decided to lend 24 largeanti-submarine trawlers to the United States. Arrangements had previously been made to hand over 10 corvettes, under construction or repair, to the UnitedStates.8. Owing to U-boat attacks in the Caribbean in the middle of Februaryit then became necessary, since the United States were unable to afford adequate protection, to cut down tanker sailings. The routeing of the remainder was madethe subject of continuous study by the Admiralty and Ministry of War Transport.9. We continued to press for the institution of the United States coastalconvoy, and offered to open out the cycle of the Atlantic convoy so as to make twoescort groups, as well as other reinforcements possible, to assist them. Thisentailed accepting a loss of imports estimated at 30,000 tons a month, and wasimplemented as soon as the United States plans were ready. The coastal convoysstarted on the 14th May.10. Early in May the advent of fine weather made it possible to withdrawone more group from the trans-Atlantic convoy escorts in order to start a tankerconvoy between the Dutch West Indies and Trinidad.11. On the 21st May Commander-in-Chief, United States Fleet, requested the loan of a further 15-20 corvettes to deal with the serious situation whichhad arisen in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. The proposals we madein reply were not acceptable to the United States, and Canadians and the UnitedStates authorities finally decided to start a convoy between Halifax and Arubaas soon as possible, and a further convoy between Key West and Trinidad on the1st July.12. This is how the matter stands at present, but certain modifications willbe made later. Although convoy arrangements and protective measures in theWestern Atlantic are the responsibility of the United States, the matter is constantly studied on this side with a view to securing the most advantageousemployment of available forces to meet shipping needs and making recommenda-tions to this end.Russian Convoys.13. As the Cabinet are aware, the enemy has concentrated powerful surface,submarine and air forces in Northern Norway. This has made the passage ofeach convoy a fleet operation, besides forcing us to provide close anti-aircraft and anti-submarine escort for the convoy on a greatly increased scale. It has alsomeant greatly enhanced risk of losses.Indian Ocean.14. Up to date the enemy has only made two serious attempts to interferewith our trade in the Indian Ocean. The first occurred early in. April whenJapanese forces raided shipping in the Bay of Bengal. Early this monthJapanese submarines and raiders made their appearance in the Northern and southern Approaches to the Mozambique Channel. Our requirements for escortsin the Atlantic and, North Russia prevents us sending any considerablereinforcements of anti-submarine vessels to this area, and as long as the threatcontinues on a comparatively small scale, we consider that it can be met byevasive routeing and such air cover as can be provided in certain focal areas.Allocation of Escort Forces.15. Appendix II, Table E, shows the allocation of anti-submarine vesselsemployed as Atlantic ocean escorts on the 21st June, 1942 (excluding UnitedStates ships). Table F shows the allocation of corvettes to the various commands.As the tables show, the great majority of our available escort vessels are concentrated in the North Atlantic and very few are available for other areas.16. In February 54 United States destroyers were employed to assist withthe escort of our trans-Atlantic convoys. As a result, however, of the rearrange-ment of escort duties since then the United States now provide only 3 destroyersfor the escort of trans-Atlantic trade convoys, 5 on the Iceland shuttle service,and 16 for the escort of troop convoys, making a total of 24.
17. Table G shows the number of anti-submarine escort vessels expected tobe completed for the British Empire from June 1942 to the end of 1943. Fleetdestroyers are not generally available for trade protection duties. It will thus be seen that the number of escorts may be expected to increase by only 20 by theend of the year 1942. The United States programme was not scheduled toproduce any convoy escorts before the end of the year, but as mentioned abovethe United States authorities have at last realised the vital necessity of producingthese vessels in adequate numbers as rapidly as possible. Two hundred and fiftyhave already been ordered, the programme which now totals some 700, has been,given the highest priority. There is as yet no information as to the accelerationthat will be achieved, but some vessels will probably be completed by the end ofthe year. The United States are also building numbers of fast motor boats,which are employed on anti-submarine escort work in more sheltered waters. Atthe present time the escort forces in the Atlantic have had to be reduced in strength to the barest minimum to meet the ever-increasing commitmentselsewhere. Making due allowance for losses, and taking into account the rateof U-boat construction, which is believed to be about 20 per month, it is evident that until the United States programme becomes effective the present acute shortage of escort vessels will continue.So far as the Admiralty programme is concerned it is clearly of the greatest importance that the high priority accorded to escort vessels should be made effective.Additional Measures for the Protection of Convoys.Auxiliary Aircraft Carriers:18. Measures are in hand to provide auxiliary aircraft carriers to work with the &quot;convoys. Three have been completed and are now working up and afurther 13 are expected to complete this year. In 1943 it is hoped a further12 of these ships building in the United States will be allocated to us. Arrange-ments have also been made for 2 merchant ship grain carriers building in theUnited Kingdom to be fitted with a flush deck to enable them to operate a fewanti-submarine aircraft. These ships will carry their usual cargo. It is underconsideration to fit additional ships.A utogyros and Helicopters.19. Experiments are proceeding with the Autogyro and Helicopter, which,it is hoped, will be able to operate from a platform built on a merchant ship.C.A .M. Ships.20.^ Thirty-five ships have been fitted with a Sea Hurricane on a catapult.These ships were designed as a quick answer to the attacks on our convoys byFocke-Wulf aircraft. Since they only carry a one-shot fighter aircraft, the laterdevelopments mentioned above are considered to be a more profitable line to pursue.Disguise of Tankers.21. Tankers have been singled out for attack by enemy U-boats and ascheme is in hand to disguise 10 Diesel-engined tankers now building to resembleordinary cargo vessels.Armament of Escort Vessels.22. A new weapon, known as the &quot; Hedgehog,&quot; is being fitted in a largenumber of escort vessels. This weapon, which fires a salvo of 24 projectiles ahead of the attacking vessel, will, it is expected, greatly increase the chances of thedestruction of U-boats. Great progress has also been made in the fitting of radio-locaters for the detection of U-boats on the surface at night. Radio-telephony isinstalled in the majority of escort vessels for use in co-ordinating attacks onU-boats.Armament of Merchant Vessels.23. Continual progress is being made with the armament of merchant ships.Ships are now being equipped with High Frequency Direction Finders to assist
with the location of U-boats in the vicinity of a convoy. Fast merchant vessels are equipped with depth charges. The anti-aircraft equipment of merchantvessels is being increased as fast as the material and labour available will allow.A type of net defence, which is designed for use at sea by merchant ships (ofcertain speeds) to afford some measure of protection against torpedo attack, isbeing fitted to appropriate ships under construction. The United States havealso adopted the system.Review of the Anti-U-boat Campaign and Air Offensive.24. It is believed we are approaching another of the turning points in theGerman U-boat campaign.Since January the main weight of attack has been in the Western atlantic and until recently attacks on our other convoys have more or less been abandoned,with the exception of the attempt to interrupt the flow of supplies to Russia.The slowly increasing potency of the anti-submarine effort on the Atlanticseaboard* has led. to an increased scale of attack in the Caribbean and to thesouth and east of the Antilles and to the development of the U-boat threat inthe Gulf of Mexico. Convoy and escort should start in the Caribbean on the1st July and should thereafter increase : in this connection we have drawn theattention of the United States to the importance of providing a strong air effort to the eastward of Trinidad.The above measures may be expected to encourage the dispersal for theconcentrated, U-boat effort in the Western Atlantic.There are already signs of a renewed threat to our north-south convoysin the Eastern Atlantic, and it may be that the easing of the situation in theWestern Atlantic will be followed by a renewed onslaught on our cross-atlantic convoys. The further extension of U-boat efforts in.the South Atlantic must also be expected.25. As regards our readiness to meet this renewal of the attack on the convoys for which British escorts are, in the main, responsible, we cannot regard the present average strength of the convoy escorts with any equanimity. our aid to the United States and the greatly increased scale of protection given toour convoys to and from Russia have drawn heavily on our general strength withthe Atlantic convoys. But we are to this extent better off than we were a yearago. There is much more confidence among the majority of our escort vesselsthat they can compete with the U-boat attacking at night. Moreover, manyof our groups have now worked together for some time and have acquired a teamspirit and mutual confidence. Several instances have recently occurred of convoyswith a comparatively weak escort being able to drive off the attack of a certainnumber of U-boats with only slight loss. In these encounters the U-boats have,on many occasions, at least received a rough handling.Thus, if we have to face a really heavy scale of &quot; pack &quot; U-boat attack onour cross-Atlantic convoys, we may at least hope to give the U-boats a very muchmore difficult task than we should have done a year ago, and although we shallundoubtedly suffer losses, perhaps heavy losses, to our shipping, we should alsobe able to inflict considerable damage on the enemy.26. Finally, in reviewing the situation, the rising scale of air operations against U-boats working from Biscayan ports must be borne in mind, togetherwith our recent success in harrying newly-commissioned U-boats outward boundfrom the Baltic during their passage round Scotland. With the advent into service of squadrons lent from Bomber Command and of the searchlight-fittedWellington aircraft for night work, and with the production of Torpex-filleddepth-charges, there is no doubt that we have, during the past month, achievedvery successful results in the inner Bay area. One U-boat is believed to havebeen sunk, two have been driven to seek shelter in Spanish ports, with severe damage, and at least two have been forced to turn back to harbour.Despite these highly satisfactory results, however, it must be emphasised that the Admiralty requirements for medium-range aircraft to maintain thepatrol of the &quot; inner &quot; area in the Bay of Biscay have not yet, in the Admiralty* Note. In addition to the reinforcements of escort vessels made available to the UnitedStates, it was agreed to forgo the delivery of 100 float planes in order that they should beavailable for anti-submarine work on the east coast of the United States.
view, been met in full. One squadron, capable of night operations, has yet to beprovided. Moreover, there is the &quot; outer &quot; area of the Bay of Biscay, in whichpast experience has led us to hope we should find a fruitful field for A/S work.To maintain daylight jDatrols in this area the Admiralty demanded 4 long-rangesquadrons, each of 9 aircraft. None of these have yet been provided and, inthe result, our operations have been, in the main, limited to the &apos;&apos; inner &apos;&apos; area.The very success of our recent operations in the &quot; inner &quot; area will inevitablyenhance the importance of maintaining an anti-submarine effort in the &quot; outer &quot;area, since by diving in the &quot; inner &quot; area in daylight hours, U-boats can evadeour air attack by day at the cost of a small reduction of their time on patrol.27. It has already been pointed out that the general shortage of anti-submarine vessels is acute and will remain so for some time to come. Immenseimportance, therefore, is attached to developing the maximum attack onU-boats on passage in the Bay of Biscay. This will not only assist the UnitedStates, but will materially contribute to the safety of shipping in all parts of the atlantic. We realise there are conflicting requirements, but in view of the urgency and vital importance of the matter we feel bound to reiterate our viewthat, until such time as replacement \ong-range aircraft are available, thisAdmiralty requirement should be met by exploiting still further the flexibilitybetween Bomber and Coastal Commands in order to provide the latter with the requisite additional aircraft on loan.A. V. A.L.June 22, 1942.
Losses by Enemy Action of Merchant Ships of all Tonnages.Following the last publication of Mercantile loss figures up to end ofJune 1941, there followed a period of five months (July-November) when the losses were exceptionally low and averaged only 168,000 gross tons per month. Thencame the entry of the United States and Japan into the war on the 7th December,the immediate result of which was a sharp upward tendency in the losses which for December aggregated some 415,000 gross tons. This total included a goodproportion of tonnage written off in the Far East as captured or sunk by theJapanese.The U-boat campaign in the Western Atlantic opened on the 12th Januaryby the sinking of the British s.s. Cyclops and the Norwegian Frisco off the EasternSeaboard of the United States, which was followed up by the sinking of a further33 vessels in this area by the end of the month.Tn February the losses rose steeply to 608,000 gross tons and the area of theU-boats&apos; operations was further extended to the Caribbean and tanker tonnageappeared to be the principal target.March saw a further rise in the tonnage lost to the peak figure of769,000 gross tons, but this total contained a certain amount of tonnage lost in the Malayan and Dutch East Indies areas where a number of vessels had tobe scuttled and abandoned.In April the losses, though still high, showed a drop to 607,000 gross tons,which included rather more than 100,000 tons sunk in the Indian Ocean as aresult of the attack by Japanese warships in the Bay of Bengal and Ceylon area.The operations of U-boats in the Western Atlantic were extended into the MexicanGulf.In May the total of losses reached the second highest total of the war at681,000 gross tons. The bulk of these losses occurred in the Western north atlantic, including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, where the U-boats were particularly active. About 62,000 gross tons was lost in the Arctic Sea and murmansk *areas as the result of attacks by submarines and aircraft on the ships in convoy taking supplies to Russia.The losses for June (recorded up to the 18th) total 396,000 gross tons, andat this rate it appears that the total for the month will probably be heavy. Thereare so far only nine tanker losses, which indicates an improvement in the losses of these vessels resulting from putting them into convoys in the Western north atlantic including West Indies area.U-boat activity has also shifted further South in the Caribbean to the PanamaCanal area in the vicinity of Colon, where several valuable ships were recentlysunk.
