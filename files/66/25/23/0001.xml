^51? P?-C--r/I.ENT IS THE property QF 5iL.BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT     j 0 printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1942.SECRET. Copy No.    4 2W.P. (42) 243.June 8, 1942.WAR CABINET.YUGOSLAV ARMY CRISIS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE trouble which has arisen in the Yugoslav forces in the Middle Eastdates back some six months to the time when General Simovic was replaced asYugoslav Prime Minister by M. Jovanovic. The new Yugoslav Governmentdismissed Colonel Hie, their Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, and attempted to impose an unpopular and incompetent officer, Colonel Lozic, in his place. Thisaroused resentment on the part of a number of the best officers in the Yugoslavforces and the split among those forces has widened with time.2. General Auchinleck took a serious view of the situation from the outset,but was naturally inclined to view the matter primarily from the military angle.The situation which developed has very definite political implications as welland these, I felt, were not sufficiently understood by their military authoritiessince it seemed that their sympathies were definitely on the side of the dissidentelements. &apos;3. In the course of time and as the result of considerable pressure by us, theCommander-in-Chief was prevailed upon to intern all the dissident elements some 300 out of the total of 1,200 Yugoslav troops in Egypt. Colonel Rakic was sent out by the Yugoslav Government to assume temporary command and to reporton the situation. Once the actual danger of disorder became less acute, theMinister of State was asked to help in finding a solution. Various suggestions for a solution have been proposed by us, but have not been favourably receivedby the authorities in the Middle East. In the meanwhile, the Yugoslav Govern-ment&apos;s resentment against our attitude in this connexion has been growing apace,and they are now openly accusing us of deliberately blocking every hope of settlement and of backing their opponents.4. On the 30th May an urgent appeal was made to the Minister of state to agree to a scheme which, in our opinion, offered a reasonable prospect of success.Briefly, it was that Mr. Rendel and M. Gavrilovic (Minister of Justice) should pro-ceed to Egypt to carry out an enquiry on the spot. The Yugoslav Government would only agree to this on condition that the ringleaders should first be separated from the rest of the dissidents, and it was suggested that these six or seven men should be sent to Khartoum and Luxor, where M. Gavrilovic and Mr. Rendel should see them if necessary. It was then proposed that M. Gavrilovic should be allowedto interview all the internees and explain the Governments attitude. &apos; the yugoslav Government would be prepared to allow all &quot;those who wished to returnto the loyal units to do so without penalty and eventually to appoint a newCommander-in-Chief.5. The War Council and the Minister of State have now refused to consider this scheme. They state that the removal of the ringleaders (who are internedwith the rest of the dissidents) would provoke a pitched battle; and we now learn11745   [23924]
2that the internees have been allowed to retain their machine guns and other arms which appears an original and unmilitary method of interning dissidentelements. They revert to a scheme previously suggested by them which, there isno doubt whatsoever, would be quite unacceptable to the Yugoslav Government,who would resign rather than agree to it. Although this in itself might not be disastrous, there is little likelihood of a better Government being formed andour conduct over this affair is so widely criticised in Yugoslav circles that weshall forfeit the goodwill of whatever Government may come into power.6. In the absence of any convincing explanation of the attitude adoptedby the Minister of State and War Council, it is submitted that a further attempt should be made to persuade them to agree to our scheme before imposing a solution on the Yugoslav Government on the lines suggested by the Minister of State,which would most likely force the Yugoslav Government to resign.A. E.Foreign Office, June 8, 1942.
