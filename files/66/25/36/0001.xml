(42) 2S6.June 16, 1942.JTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.THE CARRIAGE OF AMERICAN TROOPS IN BRITISH VESSELS.Note by the Minister of War Transport.THE number of troops carried by the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth wasabout 6,000 until recently; their present carrying capacity is about 10,500 each.2. General Lee, Chief of the American Army Transportation Services, has asked whether the numbers of American troops carried on the Queen. Mary andthe Queen Elizabeth for North America-United Kingdom voyages could be materially increased from their present level to, say, 14,000-15,000. Thesevoyages start early in August.3. This suggestion is being examined by technical experts, but there is little doubt that such numbers would be feasible if the risk were accepted. Itmust be recognised that if a ship of this size were torpedoed or were set on fireby bombing, a very large number of the troops carried would inevitably be lost.If the numbers were raised as high as 15,000, the equivalent of a whole division would be at risk in one ship.4. There is, of course, no possibility of sufficient boats being carried even for the present numbers, but buoyancy apparatus and lifejackets can be providedfor all on board, even for the suggested increased numbers. These ships will proceed across the Atlantic unescorted, relying for safety on their speed.5. The confusion in the event of fire or flooding would be bound to be greatlyincreased by any further increase in numbers.6. For an operational move, the War Office would be prepared to agree toBritish troops in greater numbers than those at present agreed, and I do not seeon What grounds we can object to the Americans accepting the risk for their troops, if General Lee&apos;s request is approved by the highest authorities on theother side. The risk to the British crew (about 1,000 men) would, of course, beincreased.7. I feel, however, that I am bound to give my colleagues an opportunityof expressing their views on this proposal in view of the serious criticism thatwould undoubtedly arise should one of these troopships be lost with heavy loss of life, especially as it cannot be said that the embarkation of the higher numbersis required as part of an urgent operational move.L.Ministry of War Transport,June 16, 1942.MOST SECRET Copy No.   2 6[23966]
