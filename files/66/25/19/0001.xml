THjS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMEKT^1SECRET. X Copy No.  W.P. (42) 239.Jmit&apos; 5, 1942. .yTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It Is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.FRANCO-GERMAN CO-OPERATION  IN  NORTH  AFRICA,  &amp;c.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.1. Whatever our feelings of well-placed scorn and distrust of the vichy government may be, we ought not to forget that it is the only Government whichmay perhaps give us what we want from France, namely, the Toulon Fleet andthe entry into the French North African provinces. One has therefore to consider what, if any, are the chances of this. They do not seem to me entirely negligible.The Vichy Government under Darlan, Laval or perhaps Doriot must, of course,pay its way from week to week with its German masters. Their only alternative is the installation of a Gauleiter and complete occupation. From my own personalobservation of what has happened, I do not feel that the Vichy Government havedone anything more than was absolutely necessary to stave off this second alternative. They have borne Gran, Dakar. Syria, Madagascar, the Britishblockade and British air raids with the least possible show of anger. this attitude has been forced upon them by the sentiment against Germany of the vast majority of the French nation, both in occupied and unoccupied France, andby the French conviction that they must not sever the future of France from theUnited States.2. The cardinal question not only for Vichy but for France is who willwin the war 1   At first there seemed no possibility of defeating Germany.   But[23901]
2the campaigns in Russia, the entry of the United States, the enormous staying,power of Great Britain, our evident growing preponderance in the Air, have brought back hope to virile French hearts and affected ever wider circles inFrance The Germans are not sure even of the tools they tolerate at the headof French affairs. They know that it is the interest even of such creatures tojoin the winning side once they are sure which it is, and that they have a giftto give to the Allies of inestimable value.3 i have always been ready to take rough action against Vichy, and have always been sure that Vichy would in one shape or another put up with it. Ilook forward to a time in the war, which I cannot fix but which may not be faroff when the great change of heart which has taken place m the French massesand the apparent certainty of an Allied victory will produce a sudden, decisivechange in the action of the Vichy Government.w. s. c.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,June 5, 1942.
