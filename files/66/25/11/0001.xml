COALOn May 13th the Lord Privy Seal informed the House of Commons that- The Government have considered the question of fuel rationing in the lightf the views expressed in the recent Debate, and they have decided to submit&quot; the House after Whitsun their coal proposals as a whole, covering both pro-Uuciion and consumption and the organisation of the industry.&quot;2 Owing to the expansion of war production and other war-time causes the, &quot; n(j for coal is still increasing.   But the output of coal is tending to decline.The present rate of production is not yielding enough coal to cover unrestricted, mg5tic and industrial demands.   It is therefore necessary that immediateteDS should be taken to increase the production, and to eliminate unnecessaryconsumption, of coal.Production.. Production can be increased &apos; ia) by enlarging the man-power of the industry,lb) by making the industry more efficient, i.e., by raising the output perman employed.u) Han Power.a. If output is to be maintained, still more if it must be increased, thelabour force of the&quot;industry must, at the very least, be prevented from shrink-in&quot; any further. In spite of the fact that the Essential Work Order has been applied to the industry and that men are not, therefore, at liberty to leave it at will, there is at present a net wastage of some 25,000 men per. annum.5. Last year wastage was offset, and a decline in output prevented, by the turn to the mines of 33,000 men from other industries. The Governmentecently decided that this year also it would be essential to bring back aertain number of ex-miners not only from industry but also from the armedorces. As a result of this decision, the following are now being returned toe mines, from industry and the Civil Defence Services, from the ground-stafff the R.A.F. and from certain units in the Army at home which do not formart of the Field Force :From the Army.........      ...      ...      6,500From the R.A.F.       ........,      ...      1,300From Industry and Civil Defence     ...      ...      3,500These expedients, though they relieve immediate needs, cannot be repeated-j by year.   More lasting remedies must be found for closing the gapween normal entry into, and exit from, the industry by increasing thetry of boys and youths, and by checking the outflow of older men.6. In normal times the new entrants into the industry consisted not only ofys but also of young adults who came into the mines from agriculture and where. Under war conditions there is no means of drawing any substantialmbers of young men into the industry. ^It may, however, be possible tocure that some of the men who are being displaced from the less essentialdustries (as arrangements are made for their work to be taken over by.men) shall enter the mines rather than the armed forces.   The Minister ofbour has given instructions that coal mining shall be added to the list ofority industries which such men may choose in preference to- military&apos;ce.. The problem of juvenile recruitment to the industry is being considered a Departmental Committee appointed by the Minister of Labour and theident of the Board of Trade under the Chairmanship of Sir John Forster.soon as the report of this Committee is available, the Government will&quot;ider, as a matter of urgency, what further steps should be taken to ease the recruitment of boys and youths to the industry.
48. Although there is nothing that can be done to reduce the numbers leaving the industry through death, disablement and normal retirement, it shouldbe possible to reduce die numbers of those leaving with medical certificateon account of sickness of a not very serious character. In many casTminers suffering through illness from some loss of physical fitness couldbe retained in the industry if further arrangements were made for medical treatment. The Government therefore propose to establish a Medical Consultative Service for the mines (see para. 18 below).(b) Efficiency.9. Apart from the problem of maintaining or increasing the labour forceof the industry, output could be increased by:  (i) concentrating the available men and machinery on the more pro.ductive pits and seams;(ii) extending mechanisation;(iii) arranging, by the grouping of pits or otherwise, that all collierieshave available to them the advice of the most competent mininoengineers in their District;(iv) reducing avoidable absenteeism.10. The most direct means of-securing an early increase in output is by concentrating effort at the points of highest production. A theoretical calcula-tion of the results that might be achieved by this means in Districts product44 per cent, of the total output indicates that by transferring 17,800 men&quot;out of a total labour force of 277,000, to an average distance of only fourmiles from their present pits, output might be increased by 6j per cent.Assuming, that a similar result might be achieved in other Districts, these. measures of concentration would, if applied comprehensively throughout theindustry, increase total output by about 250,000 tons a week. This theoreticalcalculation must, of course, be substantially discounted to allow for thepractical difficulties of concentration, including the reluctance of men to transfer from the pits in which they have been accustomed to work. But there isno doubt that, with the good will of the men, very large increases in outputcould be secured by this means.11. As regards absenteeism, there has been some tendency in recent discus-sions to exaggerate the gain in production which might be secured by checkingabsenteeism and by additional effort on the part of the men. It is doubtfulwhether in fact avoidable absenteeism is greater in the mines than in otherindustries. While the absenteeism percentage has risen substantially duringthe war, there has also been a steady rise in the number of shifts workedwage earner; and in the last week for which statistics are available the numherof shifts worked Was 5.66, the highesf on record. Charges of excessiveabsenteeism cannot be sustained against the great majority of the miners.While, however, the average figures are not unsatisfactory, there is urdoubtedly some avoidable absenteeism; and it is important that every possiMstep should be taken to reduce this to a minimum. It is admitted that ftexisting arrangements for dealing with individual cases of absenteeism are 10working satisfactorily; and in paragraph 17 below certain proposals are seout for altering the present procedure.Reorganisation.12. In order to ensure that all practicable means of increasing outputadopted without delay and pressed forward without consideration of an.private interests, the Government have decided to assume full control 01The operation of the mines, and to organise the industry on the basisnational service, with the intention that the organisation now to be establishwill continue pending a final decision by Parliament on the future of industry. &quot;&apos;.
- por this purpose no far-reaching new powers will be required in addi-- n to the Wide powers already available under the Defence Regulations.What is needed is, not so much fresh powers, as machinery to enable those powers to be exercised effectively.The problem of increasing output is, in the main, one of securing detailedhanges in the operation ot particular collieries. These cannot be broughtCbout through directions issued from the centre. What is needed is an active Regional organisation charged with responsibility for securing themaximum production from the mines in each Region, and exercising, by virtue of delegation, the full powers of direction and control conferred on theSecretary for Mines.Por this purpose National and Regional machinery will be establishedimmediately on the following lines:-National Machinery.j4._(a) With a view to ensuring maximum production to meet war-timeneeds, the responsible Minister will take full control over the operation of allcoal mines and over the allocation of the coal raised.The Minister will be assisted by a Controller-General of Production, whowill have as his chief officers:  (ij A Production Director, responsible for efficiency and volume, ofproduction.(ii) A Labour Director, responsible for welfare, safety, health and work-ing conditions of coal-miners, and allocation of labour.(iii) A Services Director, responsible for distribution and allocation ofcoal. -(iv) A Finance Director, responsible for all financial arrangements, in-cluding advice on coal prices.(b) A National Coal Board will be established. The Board will meetunder the chairmanship of the Minister and will consist of the- followingmembers appointed by him-The Controller-General (Vice-Chairman).The Vice-Chairmen of the Regional Coal Boards (see paragraph (14)below).A number of pit managers and colliery technicians.Persons representing coal distribution.Persons representing coal consumers.(c) The Board, thus composed s&quot;o as to leave no Region unrepresented, will do much of its detailed work through Sub-Committees.(d) The functions of the Board will be:  (i) To consider the general planning of production, including the.allo-cation of district and regional targets. . 1(ii) To consider the best means of securing the highest efficiency of thecoal-mining industry and any improvement in machinery ormethods of operation whereby output may be increased..:     vi(iii) To consider the provision of supplies, equipment and materials forthe conduct of mining operations.(iv) To consider matters relating to the maintenance of man-power andlabour productivity, including the enrolment of new entrants andthe instruction, training and advancement of boys and youths..(v) To consider all matters affecting the welfare of the mine-workers,including housing, transport and feeding facilities.
(vi) To consider questions of health and safety and, in particular su hoccupational diseases as silicosis and nystagmus, with a view tproviding all possible preventive measures, clinical treatment a 5rehabilitation. mThe Board will be responsible to the Minister, who, when exercising thpowers conferred on him by Statute and Defence Regulations will take int6consideration the recommendations of the Board.Regional Machinery.15. (a) In each coal-producing Region there will be a Controller, to whomwill be delegated die powers of the Minister to assume control of colliervundertakings and to give directions to the managements regarding the carryinoon of the undertakings. 0(b) The Controller will have the assistance of three Directors- one concernedwith the technical and engineering aspects of coal production; another concerned with labour questions in the mining industry; and a third concernedwith the public services (gas, electricity and the transport and distribution ofcoal).(c) In each Region there will be a Regional Coal Board, appointed by theMinister, to advise the Controller on matters concerning output and the meansof achieving maximum production.These Boards will comprise representatives of coal-owners, miners, managerand technical staff. The Controller will preside at meetings of the Board&apos;and two Vice-Chairmen will be elected, one representing the owners and theother representing the miners.(d) The Controller and his Directors will be responsible for ensuring thatcompetent technical advice is available to all colliery managements within their Region. In some cases the Controller may find it convenient to secure this by grouping pits for the purpose of technical advice. To supplementsuch arrangements, however, the Controller will have on his staff a numberof technical assistants whose function will be to survey the operation of par-ticular pits and, where necessary, to supervise and increase the technical efficiency of a coll&apos;ery.(e) The Controllers will have, and exercise, subject to the advice of the regional Boards, full and undivided responsibility for the&apos; policy and generalhconduct of mining operations in their Regions.   Each Controller, with tivlassistance of his staff, will exercise general supervision over the whole condnc &apos;of mining operations in his Region.   This general supervision will be sulciently close to enable him, in consultation with his Regional Coal board to give such directions as will ensure the most efficient operation of the industry, treated as a whole, in his Region, including directions as to concentration, grouping of pits, and other necessary matters relating to mininoperations.   At the same time, it is undesirable that they should be burdeneiwith the details of day-to-day management of the pits. This will be left, as iis to-day, in the hands of the managers, who will continue to be the servanlof the owners, though subject to removal at the instance of the Controlleishould he deem that course necessary.In order to avoid any blurring of responsibility, the owners of each collierundertaking will be required to nominate a single person who will be respoijsible in respect of such undertaking for receiving and carrying out the direction!of the Controller.   This would normally be the agent or pit manager. tmbController will thus have direct access to, and control. over, the person  executive charge of the working of the mine, who will similarly have direfflaccess to the Controller,
Directions given by the Controller will be mandatory (subject only to theItimate authority of the Minister) save in cases where the pit manager repre-sents in writing to the Controller that he cannot comply with the directionsconsistently with the discharge of his statutory responsibility for the safety ofthe pit. ^ is not ProPosed t0 interfere with the statutory responsibility of pitmanagers for questions of safety.In the event of any failure to carry out the Controllers directions, theMinister lias power to take over the mine and to put in a manager.pit Production Committees.16. Pit Production Committees will continue as at present constituted, toassist pit managers to secure maximum output.    They will be relieved ofresponsibitiy for dealing with individual cases of absenteeism, and will thus be free to devote their full attention&apos;to matters associated with production.Absenteeism. .  .ij. The Government propose that, in mining, as in other industries,absenteeism and persistent lateness should be made offences for which a mancan be prosecuted without the prior issue of &quot; directions &quot;.Experience in other industries has shown, however, that in the large majority of cases absenteeism can be checked by methods of persuasionwithout recourse to proceedings in. the courts. The Minister will, therefore,appoint in each Region Investigation Officers, to whom all cases of absentee-ism, persistent lateness and other disciplinary offences will have to be referred.This Officer will interview the man, within twenty-four hours of receivingsuch a report, and, if he is satisfied that the alleged offence has been com-mitted, will decide whether to warn him against a repetition of the offence orrecommend that he should be prosecuted. The Investigation Officer willnot be responsible for instituting proceedings in the courts; this will be theresponsibility of the National Service Officer.Medical Service.18. As part of this reorganisation of the mining industry, and with a viewparticularly to checking wastage of labour, there will be established a MedicalConsultative Service for the mines.The organisation of this Service has yet to be worked out in detail,he general aim, however, will be to ensure that in each Region there shall beleast one full-time medical officer responsible, under the Regional Con-oller, for co-ordinating and, where necessary, supplementing the facilitiesvailable for the medical treatment of miners.All applications for release on medical grounds will be dealt with throughService, and arrangements will be made in suitable cases for men toeceive appropriate treatment designed to enable them to continue theirmployment in the mines.ages Machinery.v). The wages and profits structure of the coal mining industry has beenrated on the basis of division of proceeds as between wage costs androfits.  It is not intended by these proposals to introduce any fundamentalteration in the financial structure of the industry.The Government take the view that the success of the proposed Nationaloal Board as a body for promoting increased production would be gravelyejudiced if it were associated in any way with wages questions. It is,wever, desirable that a system should be developed by which questions oiages and conditions in the mining industry would be dealt with on ahonal basis and by a properly constituted national body; r;
8 &apos;   1The Government therefore propose to discuss with both sides of the indntthe question of establishing a procedure and permanent machinery for dealagainst the background of a continuous review, both nationally and locau&apos;&apos;with questions of wages and conditions. *20. The Government will be prepared to examine any other questionsdetail connected with these proposals which either side may wish to raise&apos;Outcrop Deposits.21. There are certain areas in this country where coal seams run sufficienti 1near the surface to make it possible to work them by open cast minim,&apos;ISteps were taken early this year to develop such outcrop deposits. Althouat (first, results were disappointing and the quality of the coal raised is good, progress has recently been more rapid and output from these depo&amp;is expected to rise sharply in the coming months. 022. As a result of all these measures the addition of 11,300 undergroujworkers to the labour force, the working of outcrop . deposits, and ymeasures for increased efficiency enforced through the scheme of GovernmeJcontrol outlined above-the Government look to a substantial increase \moutput during the coming year.By this increase of output, together with greater economies in consumJItion, the Government count on bridging the existing gap between productimBand consumption, and providing a margin against the many contingencitPwhich the ever-changing course of the war may bring.   They have, thereforeldecided that it is not necessary, particularly at this stage of the war, Jwithdraw any further men from the armed Forces or from other war indjtries, for work in the mines.   They have also decided not to introduceonce a compulsory scheme of rationing the domestic consumption of fuel.Substantial further economies in coal consumption must, however, lmsecured.Consumption.23. (a) Industrial.About three-fifths of our total coal output is consumed by industrytransport, either directly or in the form of electricity and gas. The Goveiflment are satisfied that substantial economies can be obtained from industijconsumers without damage to war production. Such economies willachieved (i) through improved methods of fuel consumption. A committeeexperts has been at work for some months examining the tecbnflquestions involved, conducting an educational campaign, inspaaping, through a staff of engineers, the methods now used in kinds&quot;and advising, where necessary, on suitable improvements,(ii) by the introduction of a system of allocating coal to industry sirto that for allocating raw materials. A scheme for making delallocations to the main coal consuming industries is now MBworked out by the Mines Department. The minimum needs *selected industries will be determined one by one, beginning 1the  less essential   industries   whose coal  consumption -excessive.-(6) Domestic Rationing.24. After full consideration of the views expressed in the Debate iiHouse of Commons on May 7th, and after examination of various altermschemes, the Government have decided that the most practical and eJ**method of rationing the consumption of domestic fuel is by mean&quot; points &quot; scheme of rationing on the lines indicated in the Annex.
As stated above the Government have decided that it is not essenti:lhl, scheme should be introduced forthwith.   It is necessary, however  thattbe public should restnct their fuel consumption voluntarily as nearly as)5sible to the limits winch would be imposed on them if rationing were(reduced.   Ihe public will therefore be asked to practise the maximum3S3ible economy on a voluntary basis; and there will be sustained pubSt0 keep constantly before the public the urgent need for fuel economVt is, however, important to ensure that, if it should at any stage DecZeecessary, the scheme for the rationing of domestic fuel could be intlTuced at short notice; and all he necessary administrative preparations vTllherefore be made  including the issue to householders of the form set outparagraph 19 of the Annex and the making of assessments by Seal Fuelcrseers.z5. It is most important, if an impossible burden is not to bensport in the winter months, that all consumers who can do so should,within proper limits, stock coal during the summer.   On the other hand toecure a fair distribution between consumers, the present system of restrictionsn deliveries of solid fuel must be maintained.   So long as supplies are shorte larger consumers must not be favoured at the expense of the smaller&apos;onrrol of supplies will henceforth be much facilitated by the fact that allonsumers must now be registered with a coal merchant.   This will enablevailable supplies of coal and coke to be distributed between merchantsoughly in proportion to the number of their registered customers    Merchantsill also be required to keep records, from now on, of all deliveries in a formhich will enable Local Fuel Overseers at any time to ascertain the quantities-hich have been delivered to each of their registered customersSUMMARY  OF  PROPOSALS.1.

Industrial consumption of coal to be reduced through(i) improved methods of fuel consumption, and(ii) an organised system of allocating coal to industry.(Para. 23.)13. All necessary administrative preparations to be made for the rationinoof domestic fuel at short notice in accordance with the scheme set out in the annex, but rationing not to be imposed immediately, until a further oppor.tunity has been given to increase production and to secure voluntary reduc^tion of consumption through a sustained publicity campaign.   (Para. 24)14. The present system of restriction of deliveries of solid fuel to be main,tained; available supplies to be distributed between merchants roughly ^accordance with the number of their registered customers, and merchants tobe required to keep records of all deliveries so as to enable Local Fuel Over-seers to check the quantities supplied to different customers.   (Para. 25.)annexFUEL RATIONING SCHEME.(1) There will be a fuel ration for each household and, in addition, a fuel ration (oreach person, including children.(2) The ration will be fixed in cwt. of coal. But a consumer can take pait of hisration in other fuels- coke, gas, electricity or paraffin. These will be interchangeableaccording to a points system on the basis that 1 cwt. of coal or coke equals 5 thermsof gas or 100 units of electricity or 2 gallons of paraffin.(3) The household ration will be fixed for each household by an assessment of presentneeds according to a simple scale as shown below (para. 16). The Tation will depend on-(a) The locality of the household.   For climatic reasons, a higher scale will begiven for Scotland and the North of England than for the Midlands which in turnwill have a higher scale than London and the South.(6) The number of habitable rooms in the house (excluding sculleries, bath,rooms, etc.).(c) In the case of houses with more than seven habitable rooms, the numberof residents.The making of these assessments will be a very simple matter involving no exerciseof: judgment by any official, but only the tabulation of facts. 85 per cent: of allhouseholds contain seven habitable rooms or less.(4) The personal ration will be the same for all persons whether young or old. Itwill be 7A cwt. a year per head. Thus a family of four persons will be entitled to atotal personal ration of i  tons in addition to their household ration.(5) A supplementary ration may also be given for special needs, such as sicknessnecessitating additional.fuel, bomb damage, the use of a house for business premises, etc.These supplementary rations will be granted by the Local Fuel Overseer. They anthe only part of the ration which requires the exercise of discretion by any official, anieven, this will be largely reduced by the issue of simple rules dealing with the mos:common cases.(6) The question of miners&apos; coal will be specially dealt with, after full consnltatiotwith representatives of miners and mine owners.(7) Any householder applying for a supplementary ration, who is not satisfied vritlthe decision of the Local Fuel Overseer, will have a right of appeal.(8) The rationing period for coal, coke and paraffin will begin on the 1st July, 1942and will run to the 1st July, 1943. All coal, coke and paraffin delivered to the householder on or after 1st July, 1942 will count against his ration for these twelve montlsB* This and other dates mentioned will be subject to postponement.
-inv stocks of coal or coke in excess of one ton held on ist July, 1942 will^aliinst the ration.The rationing period for gas and electricity will also run from approximatelyluiy I e., from the first quarterly meter reading after ist September.&apos;St     During any half-year, electricity consumption in any household must not exceed&apos;      cnmDtion in the corresponding six months of the previous year, except with[he consent of the Local Fuel Overseer.. inv small excess of consumption of electricity or gas, over the amounts per-1 will be reported to the -Local Fuel Overseer and carried forward and deductedfflltte,l)e ration in the next period.   Any larger excess may be subject, on the initiativetl   Local Fuel Overseer, to prosecution and a maximum fine of, say, ten times the .      r un;t of the excess.   In cases of flagrant and deliberate excess, supplies willPnce,5 cabinet if so ordered by the Court.   It is not anticipated that such cases will bebe *-Ui cm,at all common.1     Establishments. i.e., buildings other than domestic or industrial premises viz.,tools hospitals, hotels, business offices, shops, restaurants arid places of entertain-nt etc., will be rationed on the basis of their consumption of fuel in a preceding&quot;&quot;period The amount of the reduction will be determined by the Local Fuel Overseexuth a right of appeal.   In exceptional circumstances an increase may be allowed.In addition to rationing, establishments will be subject to restrictions directed toprevent extravagant or unnecessary use of heat and light.iij) Fuel rationing can only operate fairly and effectively by means of coupons,hut steps will be taken to minimise any inconvenience which the use of these may cause. Each householder will have a ration book from which coupons will be detached.Further, each person receives a clothing ration book&apos;by ist June and may use any ofthe 15 spare coupons which it contains to purchase A cwt. of coal or the equivalent ofI otjier fuels.   This is the personal ration mentioned in (4) above.Coupons will only be required to be handed over for gas and electricity when payments made by cash or cheque. For solid fuel coupons may, if preferred, be depositedwith the order. But otherwise coupons will always go with the money. This willremove many difficuties. Thus meter readers will only need to collect coupons whenthev collect cash. All alternative arrangements which have been suggested are morecumbrous and more open to evasion and fraud.In order to save labour for the gas and electricity companies arrangements shouldbe made whereby the same person reads both the gas and electricity meters. Suchan arrangement is already in force as between the Gas Light and Coke Company andthe County of London Electric Supply Company.(r4) It is estimated that a permanent staff required throughout the country forIthe administration of fuel rationing will mean, on an average, an addition of two to three persons for each of the 1,600 Local Fuel Offices. That is to say, an addition ofsome 4,000 in all, including headquarters staff.Further, for a period of six weeks to two months, some S,ooo temporary clerks willIbe required at the Local Fuel Offices to make assessments for household rations andfto issue the household ration books.   Most of this temporary staff will be borrowed,lunder the existing arrangements for dovetailing staff between Government Depart-appointments, from the Ministry of Food.   They will just have completed their work on foodJration books and will, therefore, be available during July and August for similar work on fuel rationing.    The great majority of the staff, both permanent and tem-lorary, will consist of girl clerks, with some elderly persons.    Some temporary staffsill also be drawn from Civil Defence Services.15) The following is a provisional&apos; scale of household rations expressed in terms&apos;pt coal, to which must be added both the personal rations of all members of the house-jiold under (4) and any supplementary rations under (5).Number ofRooms.Scotland and north of England.Midlands.South ofEngland.40455560707585cwt. of coal per year30354550556070303540455055
Thus the total ration for a five roomed house with four people, each of whom ientitled to yi cut. a year as personal ration, would be 5 tons in the North, 41 to sin the Midlands, 3$ tans in the South. Any supplementary ration would be addition^to these figures.The larger houses with eight rooms or more will not receive a larger ration thai,the seven roomed houses, unless they have sufficient residents to justify it, or thereare other special circumstances. The general rule is that an extra room over sevshould only count if there are at least four residents, over eight if there are at leMlfive and sn on. The additional amount allowed per room, subject to these condition,for larger houses, will be 15 cwt. in Scotland and the North, 12I cwt. in theMidlands, and 10 cwt. in the South.(16) If any householder satisfies the Local Fuel Overseer that his previous con-sumption was not unduly high, it will not be cut by more than 334 per cent.(17) These scales will, it is estimated, produce a total saving of 10 million tons ofcoal in a full year. They will involve no reduction for about a quarter of the totalhouseholds. The remaining three-quarters will receive rations less than their preSentconsumption.(18) The scheme is a simple one and the duties of the ordinary householder may be summed up as follows:  (i) Register with a supplier for coal and for coke,(ii) Fill in the application form which will be sent to him and return it to theLocal Fuel Office. The questions that he will have to answer are outlined in(19) below.(iii) Give up coupons for all coal, coke and paraffin bought after 1st July, i942iand for gas and electricity used quarter by quarter starting with the firstmeter reading after 1st September, 1942.(19) Outline of the householder&apos;s application form.1.
