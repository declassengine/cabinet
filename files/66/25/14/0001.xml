Q  //*-) JTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1942.SECRET.W.P. W 234.June 2, 1942.WAR CABINET.MORALE OF ALLIED SEAMEN.Note by the Secretary.THE attached report from the Security Control Officer at Glasgow is circulated to the War Cabinet by direction of the Prime Minister.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES,Secretary of the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.W. 1,June 2, 1942.Security Control Officer, Glasgow,April 27, 1942.Source of Information: Various Allied ships&apos; officers.Morale of Allied Seamen.RECENTLY, it has been noted, there has been a decided decrease of moraleamong Allied seamen. This was to be expected in the case of the Dutch afterevents in the Far East, but there would appear to be other contributory factors not least of which is what they see of our war effort.It is unfortunate, to say the least, that the docks are the windows of Britain &apos;sWar Effort. What is to be seen in them is not impressive to British eyes, butBritishers know that it is not representative of the work going on inside thecountry in the production sheds and factories.Allied seamen, unfortunately, have no such knowledge because their shore lifeseldom extends beyond the waterfront or the social surge of the city. They areapt to judge the extent of our War Effort solely by the men loading anddischarging their ships.  And also from what they read in the newspapers.Articles which have appeared in the Press recently in praise of the dockersof Britain, and extracts from the speeches of politicians and other public menreferring to ships being turned round quicker by the efforts of -the dockers, havehad the unfortunate effect, too, of making Allied seamen sceptical of glowingreports they read about leaping war production figures. They know that theships are not being turned round quicker by the dockers, so that the falsity ofthese reports tends to make them suspicious of the veracity of reports on other aspects of our war effort.It should be stated here that this state of mind is not confined to Alliedseamen, but is typical, too, of British Merchant, seamen to-day, who are evenmore outspoken in their criticism of dock workers in this country. So much so,in fact, that on one troop ship, Service Officers reported several of the ship&apos;sofficers to the Captain as &quot;fifth columnists.&quot; The Captain asked what theship&apos;s officers had been saying and, when told, replied that he must be a fifthcolumnist, too, because he agreed with everything they had said! Newspaperreports and radio speeches giving the dockers a pat on the back are regarded,in the words of one British officer, as &quot;so much tripe.&quot;[23896]Copy No.
Allied seamen say : &quot; We have been two years now sailing for England, andthe dockers are doing as little work now as when the war started. And for twoyears the British Government has done nothing about it. Why not put the mall into uniform and make them work? And if they do not work, put them into jail.&quot;Security is asked the same question on every Aliied ship visited, and it isconsidered that strong Government action in this direction would undoubtedlydo much to restore Allied faith in the British War Effort, quite apart from thepractical reasons for such a move. Undoubtedly exercising a big influence onmorale is the absence of mail from home, or news of any sort from or of their families.Since shortly after America entered the war no letters have been receivedfrom Occupied Europe, as far as Security has been able to discover. While theinevitability of communications being cut was recognised at the time, thelengthening silence from their homes is having a most depressing effect. This isparticularly in evidence among the Dutch, who, until recently, generally managed to get a good mail via the United States, and also, to a less degree, amongNorwegians.Many of these men talk despondently about &quot;never seeing their homesagain.&quot;There is to be detected in the conversation of the average Dutchman andDane a distinct note of apathy. The spirit has gone out of them. Many only-express complete &quot; fed-upness &quot; with the war, and a desire to go home. all this, in Security&apos;s view, can be traced principally to the absence of news from home, and, undoubtedly, is also influenced by what they see in the UnitedKingdom docks.Propaganda Effect.The view held by Allied seamen regarding the British dockers is making for extremely bad propaganda in the United States. Allied crews talk ashorein the States about the general apathy and complacency of the British Govern-ment in allowing the dockers to load and discharge cargoes in their own time andin their own way (the longest way). They tell of dockers sitting in the holds ofships smoking and talking and playing cards, instead of working, and of othersgoing ashore and getting drunk when they are supposed to be working. They tellof how the contents of cargoes very often food are rifled; and of lengthydelays in discharging and loading; of men loading whiskey getting so drunkfrom smashing open cases and swallowing the contents that night shifts had to be abolished.Confirmation of the lurid-coloured picture they paint is forthcoming fromCanadian ships ^and now American and it is all bound to have repercussions on the Other Side.(Note. The foregoing is&apos; based on daily contact and conversation withAllied seamen.) ;
