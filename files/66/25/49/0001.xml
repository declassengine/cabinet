THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  June 1942.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SECRET. xp0py NoW.P. (42) 269.June 27, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BALTIC STATES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN February last, when we expected that the Treaty it was proposed to makewith the U.S:S.R. would cover our recognition of the Soviet claim to the baltic states, the Soviet Ambassador informed me that his Government, having seen acopy of the latest monthly issue of the Diplomatic List, had noticed withastonishment that the three Baltic Ministers still appeared on it. In thecircumstances there appeared to be no justification for retaining on the Listthe names of the three Ministers, who have no Governments to represent, and Iundertook that they should in future be omitted. M. Maisky made it clear thathe did not wish to urge that the Ministers should be deprived of their personalprivileges.2. Since, however, the question of the recognition of the Soviet claim to theBaltic States in the proposed Treaty was at that time under discussion with president Roosevelt, and I did not wish to do anything which would complicatethat discussion, I directed that the further issue of the Diplomatic List shouldbe temporarily suspended. Its continued suspension is now beginning to causes considerable practical inconvenience. Since the conclusion of the Anglo-soviet treaty the matter has been mentioned again to M. Maisky, and he has made it/clear that his Government still attach importance to the exclusion of the names ofthe three Baltic Ministers from the Diplomatic List.3. On the other hand, if their names and those of their staffs were todisappear entirely from the List at this moment, it would no doubt attractattention and might give rise to a suspicion in the United States and elsewherethat His Majesty&apos;s Government had, after all, reached some arrangement with theSoviet Government in regard to the Baltic States in connexion with the treaty negotiations.4. It is proposed therefore that the names of the three Ministers and oftheir staffs should no longer be included in the Diplomatic List itself but shouldbe shown in an annex with the following heading : List of Persons no longer included in the foregoing List but still acceptedby His Majesty&apos;s Government as possessing a diplomatic character.5. I hope that this device will suffice to satisfy the Soviet Government andat the same time to retain for the Baltic Ministers their diplomatic immunity,although, of course, I cannot answer for the Courts if any of them were threatened with legal proceedings.6.   I propose to my colleagues that this course should be adopted.A. E.Foreign Office, June 27, 1942.11773   [24011]
