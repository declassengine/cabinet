TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.LEAFLET DISSEMINATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I think the time has come for reconsideration of policy as regards leaflets,and the methods of their dissemination. Two factors combine to enhance theimportance of the leaflet. The first is the increased jamming of our broadcaststo Europe. By the use of large numbers of local jammers, our broadcasts havebeen rendered difficult to hear in many large centres of population, such as Paris:The second point is that the leaflet has the authority of the printed word. Overmost of Europe the printed word is under German control. Our method ofcountering this is by the leaflet. Moreover, the increased dissemination of leaflets stimulates the clandestine Press in Occupied Countries, since leaflets arecopied and the copies circuited on a large scale.2. The R.A.F. have recently dropped increased quantities of leaflets over germany, and during the first week of May made special disseminations overUnoccupied France.3. But the time has come for a comprehensive plan to cover those countries where leaflet dissemination is inadequate. The quantity of leaflets during thefirst 17 weeks of 1942 has not nearly satisfied the minimum needs of each country,which are given in the Annex to this paper. The problem is, however, not a purely quantitative one. It is to drop the right quantity of the right leaflet overthe right target at the right time. This objective has only been attained on a fewoccasions, when aircraft have been detailed solely for the purpose. Indeed, it isdifficult to see how it can be attained hy Squadrons engaged primarily on bombingtasks, when the following operational and geographical factors are considered : &quot;(a) When a leaflet is collected from a printer by the RA.F., it may be sentto all or only to some of dozens of Squadrons throughout England.(b) Only a proportion of these Squadrons may0 operate during the &apos;&apos; life &apos;&apos;of the leaflet.(c) If this proportion does not stock the leaflet, it will never be dropped.(d) It is usually chance if the leaflet is stocked by a Squadron operating overthe selected target on a chosen night.(e) Deliveries to widely separated stations involve loss of time and exacting-transport problems (20,000 miles were covered by R.A.F. transport,delivering leaflets to Bomber Command Groups, in February alone).4. I should welcome the concurrence of my colleagues in the followingproposal, which appears to be a better method of obtaining the requirements ofPolitical Warfare :  (1) The allocation of a special Squadron of aircraft solely for leafletdropping, with the necessary performance as regards load and range,bearing in mind that dissemination over all parts of unoccupied france is particularly required.   This Squadron should be fitted as11728   [23864]
soon as possible with apparatus for the mechanical release of leaflets,so that the load need not be manhandled, which is exhausting work at high altitudes. One Squadron of aircraft operating at 50 per cent,strength on any one night could drop more than 8-g million leafletsover France, Holland and Belgium.(2) The continued operation of the present system of dropping leaflets;during bombing sorties.(3) A representative of P.W.E. should be stationed permanently atSquadron Headquarters of the Special Leaflet Squadron to deal withworking arrangements there, including collections from the printers,distribution to crews, &amp;c. Thus, Political- Warfare would be associated with the dissemination right up to the time of the take-oft&apos;.A.

Such leaflets deal withsubjects or messages of sufficient importanceto merit individual treatment. It is clearlyimpossible to estimate in advance the exactnumber or nature of such leaflets, but they canbe expected to average 2,000,000 per week.Generally speaking, target priorities are thesame as for regular distribution. Any givenleaflet may, however, be designed for a specialtarget or series of targets.With this qualification a reasonable weeklyestimate would be :  (a) Unoccupied Zone ...(b) Occupied Zone     ...    &apos; ....(c) North Africa       ...       ...       ...1,000,0001,000,00050,000Nil695,941Nil(3) Ad Hoc Leaflets.In addition to the above, there are ad hocleaflets dictated by urgent political or opera-tional needs. These take absolute priority overall other distribution. Targets and quantitiescan only be determined by the nature of indi-vidual leaflets.   Examples would be :  Unoccupied Zone.(a) A leaflet synchronised with a commandoraid on a single target.
