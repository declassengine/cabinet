naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Large-scale operations have been carried out in the Mediterranean tosupply Malta. Of a convoy of six merchant ships from the west, two arrivedsafely. A large convoy from the east was turned back due to the presence of theItalian fleet and intense aircraft attacks.U-boat activity has been maintained and shipping losses have been heavy.Home Waters.2. Patrol craft attacked enemy shipping off Calais on the night of the14th/15th and are thought to have torpedoed one enemy vessel. M.G.B. 46 was seriously damaged and M.T.B. 201 sank while being taken in tow. Four ratingswere killed and three officers and three ratings wounded.Two Ju. 88s have been shot down during attacks on coastal convoys off thenorth coast of Cornwall and in Lyme Bay. H.M. Destroyer Wild Swan, returning from escorting a homeward convoy from Gibraltar, was bombed and sunk100 miles west of Ban try Bay on the 17th. Twelve Ju. 88s attacked while WildSivan was passing through a Spanish trawler fleet. Four were shot down andtwo crashed after collision. Three Spanish trawlers were sunk by bombs and one by collision with Wild. Stvan. Ten officers and 123 ratings, together with11 Spanish survivors, have been landed.Mediterranean.3. During&apos; the week, two heavily escorted convoys, from Gibraltar and alexandria respectively, attempted to reach Malta with essential supplies.On the morning of the 14th, the eastbound convoy consisting of six ships was attacked by aircraft off Philipviile. The Dutch s.s. Tanimbar (8,169 tons) was sunk and H.M.S. Liverpool was hit by one torpedo and forced to return in towto Gibraltar. Six enemy aircraft were destroyed. Throughout the following day the convoy, when to the southward of Pantellaria, was subjected to continuousattack by torpedo and bomber aircraft and by an enemy force of cruisers and destroyers. The s.s. Chant, (5,601 tons) and Burdwan (6,069 tons), and theUnited States tanker Kentucky (9,308 tons) were sunk by our forces after severe damage by air attack. ELM. Destroyers Partridge and Bedouin were damaged by air attack, and the latter was later sunk by torpedo aircraft whilst retiring to the westward.Early on the 16th the remaining two ships of the convoy arrived in the GrandHarbour, one being slightly damaged by mine off the entrance. On approachingMalta the Polish Destroyer Kujawiak was also mined and sunk and H.M.Destroyers Badsworth and&apos; Matchless were damaged by mines.Aircraft from Malta assisted in protecting the convoy during the later stages of its passage, and it is reported that an enemy cruiser was set on fire, a destroyerhit and other vessels damaged.On the afternoon of the 14th, an enemy force of two battleships, four cruisers and eight destroyers was reported by aircraft leaving the Gulf of Taranto on a south-easterly course. This force was subsequently shadowed by our aircraft.During the night the westbound convoy was turned back and, later in the day,having been attacked by aircraft, U-boats and E-boats, was ordered to return to alexandria. H.M.S. Hermione and H.M. Destroyer Hasty were sunk by U-boats and H.M. Destroyers Nestor and Airedale, the Bhutan (6,104 tons) and the DutchAagtekerk (6,811 tons) were sunk by bombs. H.M.S. Newcastle was torpedoed byE-boats and H.M.S. Birmingham, H.M. Minesweeper Seaham, the Potaro(2.873 tons) and City of Calcutta (8,063 tons) were damaged in aircraft attacks,but have arrived at Alexandria with the remainder of the convoy and.escorts.Casualties so far reported in H.M. ships sunk and damaged do not appear tobe heavy.The enemy force was attacked by submarines and aircraft. Hits were claimed by aircraft on both the battleships and on a destroyer. A cruiser of theTrento class (8-inch) was set on fire by the air attack and was subsequently sunk by H.M. Submarine P. 35.In the above operations, aircraft from the Middle East co-operated withour naval forces.   Details are given under Air Situation.
4. H.M. Destroyer Grove was sunk by a U-boat north-east of Bardie onthe 12th.   80 survivors were rescued.R.F.A. Bramble Leaf was torpedoed in convoy between Alexandria andTobruk on night of 9th/ 10th.During the week 7,192 tons of French merchant shipping passed Gibraltareastbound and 35,114 tons westbound all under armed escort.Pacific.5. The occupation of Attu and Kiska in the Western Aleutians by Japaneseforce was confirmed on the 12th. At Kiska three enemy cruisers and fourtransports were sighted and bombed&apos;on the 12th and one transport was damaged,the remainder scattered.The U.S.A. forces claim to have inflicted the following casualties duringbombing attacks on Kiska on 11th and 12th June : Sunk : one Japanese U-boat,damaged : 3 large cruisers, one destroyer, one gun-boat and one transport.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. H.M. Minesweeper Speedy probably sank a U-boat off Bizerta on the14th and an aircraft made a promising attack N.W. of the Shetlands.There were ten other attacks by surface craft and 12 by aircraft. Of thesenine were in the West Atlantic and Caribbean area, six westward of cape finisterre, four in northern Home Waters and three in the Mediterranean.A damaged U-boat is reported to have entered Ferrol.Enemy Intelligence.German.7.   Tank landing craft and other invasion craft have now reached the.Tromso area and are reported to have sailed further north on the 10th.   Move-ment of other invasion craft is continuing to Norway.The Priwz Etogen will be ready for sea in about two months. The two pocketbattleships Admiral Scheer and Lutzow and about six destroyers are at Narvik.In the Eastern Baltic preparations for combined operations have continued.Co-operation of ship-borne M.T.Bs. with a surface raider has been reportedin the Ascension Island area.Italian.8. A reconnaissance of Taranto on the 17th showed two Littorio Classbattleships, three Cavour Class battleships, the 8-inch cruiser Gorizia and two6-inch cruisers.   The photograph does not indicate any damage to these ships.Up to the 17th, 40,000 tons of enemy shipping has reached Tripoli from italy. Three supply ships totalling 20,000 tons are at present loading in italian ports. *Japanese.9. The Japanese force which attacked Midway Island has withdrawn to home Waters. Two cruiser Squadrons have gone to the Mandated Islands, onecruiser Squadron to Truk, and another to the Marshall Islands. The battleshipsand remaining aircraft carriers have probably returned to Home Ports to effectrepairs.   The main battle fleet is probably in Home Waters.V-boats.10. The chief development during the week has been the renewal of attacks on convoys by groups of U-boats in the North Atlantic. Elsewhere the main areaof activity has continued to be in the West Indies and Caribbean Sea, extending to the north of the Gulf of Mexico. There appears to be little change in thenumber off the eastern coasts of Canada and the United States. A few U-boatsare operating well to the northward of Brazil.[23979] B 2
Protection of Seaborne Trade.Note. In the past this section has covered the week ended noon Wednesday.In future it will cover the week ended midnight Sunday-Monday.11. During the period from the 10th to midnight on the 14th-15th, 740ships, including 215 Allied and 20 neutral, have been convoyed. Three anti-aircraft ships, 54 destroyers (including five United States destroyers) and 80sloops, cutters and corvettes Avere employed on escort duty.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending13th June totalled 438,000 tons, compared with 620,000 tons during the previous seven days, and an average of 596,500 tons for the past ten weeks. Of this week&apos;imports 36,000 tons were oil of various grades.Enemy Attack of Seaborne Trade.12. Five ships were sunk in a U-boat attack on a homeward convoy from gibraltar and one ship was torpedoed in an outward Atlantic convoy. in american waters one ship was sunk and another torpedoed in a coastal convoyeast of Boston. Reports have also been received of attacks by U-boats on 21 ships,11 of which are known to have sunk (including two tankers). Fourteen of these attacks took place in the West Indies and Caribbean area, one north of Brazil,two off the eastern seaboard of North America, three in the Mozambique channel and one off Sydney, New South Wales.A raider in the South Atlantic sank one ship south-west of Ascension Island.There were several air attacks on Channel convoys in Home Waters; one ship being sunk and one damaged.Three ships were mined off the North American coast, two of which were sunk.The losses incurred in the supply convoys to Malta, details of which have beengiven under &quot;Mediterranean,&quot; are not included in the above.British Minelaying.13. Mines have been laid by surface craft north of the Faroes and by aircraftoff the Frisian islands, Bay of Biscay ports and in the Baltic.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.14. Enemy aircraft have laid mines off the Isle of Wight on four nights thisweek. Surface craft, probably E-boats, laid mines off Dungeness and beachy head. Fifty-nine magnetic and four acoustic mines have been destroyed off theeast and south coasts.Mines have also been laid off Malta.The mine totals are 2,192 magnetic. 1,287 acoustic and 1,278 moored mines.Enemy Merchant Shipping.15. Since July 1941 twelve ships have reached ports in the Bay of Biscayin Occupied France from Japan, and of these eight have arrived.during the lasttwo months. The cargoes brought from the Far East probably total between70,000 and 100,000 tons and almost certainly inqlude rubber, particulary as some 20,000 tons of rubber is reported to have arrived in Germany recently. since junly 1941 seven ships have left European ports for the Far East.MILITARY SITUATION.Libya.16. The withdrawal from Bir Hakeim, reported in last week&apos;s Resume,was completed and later reports indicate that the great majority of the garrisonescaped with very little loss of equipment. The Free French Brigade is nowreorganising.11th June.17. During the afternoon of the 11th June an enemy armoured force,including approximately 100 tanks and lorried infantry, moved in a north-easterly
direction from the Bir Hakeim area. By nightfall a considerable armouredbattle was in progress in the general area 10 miles south-west of El Adem.A second enemy force of about 60 tanks, mainly Italian, remained west of ourdefended locality at Knightsbridge.l&apos;2th June.18. The enemy drive eastward continued the following morning, his mainconcentrations of tanks being south-south-west of El Adem. Our armoured unitswent into action against these enemy forces. The armoured battle continue during the whole day in the area between Knightsbridge and El Adem and casualties on both sides were heavy. An attack against our defended locality atEl Adem was repulsed and the enemy occupied positions to the north, where hewas attacked by our mobile columns.13th June.19. Severe fighting went on during the 13th and enemy armoured forcessucceeded in gaining positions on the ridge north of the Trigh Capuzzo andastride the road Acroma-Bir Hakeim. This rendered the position of our garrison at Knightsbridge untenable, and it was accordingly withdrawn during the night of the 13th-14th.14:th June.20. On the morning of the 14th the enemy commenced his expected thrusttowards Acroma in three columns from the south-west, south and south-east.Each column included a number of tanks and these were engaged by ourarmoured units. Severe fighting followed. Our defended localities at Acromaand 8 miles to the west held the attack, but a position south-west of Acromawas overrun after a very gallant fight. Meanwhile our mobile columns continued their attacks on the enemy&apos;s rear in the south-east.The area south of the Trigh Capuzzo between El Adem and Harmat was cleared of the enemy.15th June.21. About noon on the 15th enemy mobile forces, supported by tanks and artillery, launched an attack on our defended locality at El Adem. This attack was broken up by the defenders, assisted by our mobile forces. The enemy was reported to be digging in to the north-west. A further attack was developingin the south-west early in the afternoon. In all, three attacks on our defendedpositions in this area were beaten off during the day, and the enemy is believed to have suffered heavily.Withdrawal from Gazala.22. Meanwhile a decision had been taken to withdraw our forward troops from the Gazala and El Hamza area. This proceeded smoothly through the 14thand 15th. Success of this operation was largely due to the fine resistance offered by our armoured units and the garrisons of our defended localities west of Acromaduring the 14th.lQth June.23. During the night 15th/ 16th strong enemy patrols approached ourposition east of El Adem, and at 1000 hours on the 16th a force of thirty tanks,with lorried infantry, moved slowly eastwards to the south of Sidi Rezegh. Thereit was heavily bombed while forming up for an attack. Some of our armouredunits were disposed in readiness to meet such an attack, and at 1300 hours an engagement was reported to be in progress.Another attack, which lasted all day, failed to dislodge our troops fromAcroma, but those holding Mrassas, further north, were withdrawn.17th June.24. In spite of strong action by our light forces the enemy continued histhrust eastwards, and on the 17th it was decided to withdraw our garrisons fromEl Adem and Sidi Rezegh.
Russo-German Campaign.Northern Sector.25. Although the Germans suggest that the Russians have attacked heavilysouth-east of Leningrad, the fighting there has probably been only of a minorcharacter.Southern Sector.26. On the 10th June the Germans launched an attack north-east ofKharkov, in which it is reported that they emploj^ed four armoured and eightinfantry divisions. The fighting has been heavy and the Germans have gainedsome ground, apparently crossing the River Donets at one point. The Russiansclaim, however, that the. position is now stabilised and that they have counter-attacked, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.Crimea.27. The German offensive against Sebastopol started on the 7th June.Despite very heavy pressure, both by land forces and by air bombardment, theyhave made little progress and there are indications that the attack has died down for the time being. Between the 10th and 13th June the Russians claim to haveinflicted 20,000 casualties on the Germans and heavy losses on the Roumaniantroops engaged.  The morale of the Sevastopol garrison is reported to be excellent.Summary.28. The attack in the Kharkov area may be a preliminary phase of the mainGerman offensive. It is therefore to be expected that the fighting will spread toother parts of the southern front. If, however, the attack on Sevastopol isrenewed, it seems probable that the offensive on the main southern front will notbe fully developed until this operation has been either successfully Concluded orabandoned.China.29. Japanese operations in Kiangsi and Chekiang Provinces have made considerable progress and, in spite of the paucity of information, there is little doubt that the forces advancing from the East along the Kiangsi-ChekiangRailway are on the point of making contact with -those advancing from Nanchangand the west. The junction of the two Japanese columns moving from the eastand the west will complete the occupation of the whole Kiangsi-Chekiang Rail-way and, apart from placing them in control of the aerodromes in Chekiang, will facilitate their control over territory to the south. This line will become of greatstrategical value to the Japanese, but its loss should not seriously interfere withChinese ability to resist any further advance.Intelligence.South-West Pacific Area.30. Japanese reinforcements of 500 to 1,000 are reported to have landed in portuguese Timor. Continued Allied guerrilla activity is reported on this island.South Pacific Area.31. The United States garrison in the New Hebrides has been increased.United States Army, Marine and Air Force personnel have been stationed atEfate. United States Army personnel have been stationed on Espiritu SantoIsland.AIR SITUATION.General.32. In Libya all available aircraft were heavily engaged in supporting our land forces and in extensive offensive operations.A large number of sorties Avere flown during the convoy operations in theMediterranean reported under &quot; Naval Situation.&quot;
tUnited Kingdom. -33. Fighter Command flew 419 defensive sorties by day and 632 by night.(Offensive sorties and shipping protection patrols are given in paragraphs 34and 36.)Enemy operations overland were restricted to a few brief incursions by individual aircraft into coastal areas, mainly along the south coast. Two were destroyed by fighters and two by A.A.-gun fire; fighters probably destroyedanother and damaged three more.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.34. The activities of Fighter and Bomber Commands have been on a verysmall scale, only 254 and 4 sorties being despatched compared with 2,144 and83 sorties last week.Four sweeps involving thirteen squadrons of Spitfires were carried out overNorthern France, but all proved uneventful.Twenty-eight Spitfires, mostly operating in pairs, were despatched onharassing operations. A gasometer was damaged, three barges were set on fire,and a number of locomotives and a goods-train were attacked. One Spitfire is missing.Wellingtons dropped bombs on Borken and Hamborn.Night.35. Adverse weather restricted operations by Bomber Command and only143 aircraft were despatched against land targets compared with 644 aircraftlast week.One hundred and six aircraft were despatched against Essen, the crews being-instructed to attack Bonn as an alternative target. About 117 tons of H.E. andincendiaries were dropped over the Bonn area, and about 37 tons over Essen, but,except for some fires, no results were seen.There was a small-scale attack on the submarine base at St. Nazaire.Fighter Command despatched thirty-four aircraft to patrol aerodromes in occupied Territory.From the above operations nine bombers are missing.Coastal Operations.36. Coastal Command flew 523 sorties, of which 67 were on convoy escort.Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 1,000 sorties.In the Heligoland Bight, bombs from Hudsons sank two vessels of about900 tons, and damaged two others of 1,500 and 1,000 tons respectively.Spitfires attacked and probably sank an armed minesweeper and a motorlaunch, and damaged a trawler and an R-boat.One hundred and forty-nine aircraft of Bomber Command laid 330 sea-mines in enemy waters.  Four aircraft are missing.Mediterranean.Convoy Operations.37. Strong air support was given to two of our convoys, and hits are claimedon 2 battleships, 2 cruisers (which were set on fire), two destroyers and on other-vessels (reported under &quot; Naval Situation &quot;). Three hundred and twelve fighter and torpedo bomber sorties were flown from Malta in support of. the Eastboundconvoy and 452 sorties from Malta and Egypt in support of the Westbound,convoy. During these operations we destroyed 21 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed six and damaged sixteen. U.S.A. Liberators co-operated with the RoyalAir Force.  We lost a total of 22 aircraft.In addition, diversionary raids were carried out against the Naval dock area at Taranto, the harbour at Piraeus and on aerodromes in Crete.
Libya.38. Except when hampered by sandstorms, our aircraft were intensivelyemployed throughout the week, in bombing objectives in enemy territory and supporting our ground forces.Bombers and fighter-bombers carried out attacks on hostile positions nearBir Hakeim and, later, on columns moving towards El Adem and in the SidiRezegh and Acroma areas. A large number of enemy tanks and mechanisedvehicles were destroyed or damaged. Aerodromes and landing-grounds wereeffectively attacked and bombs were dropped on a tank recovery unit and on anenemy Headquarters.Offensive sorties on a considerable scale were carried out by fighters, inaddition to reconnaissances and protective patixfls over shipping. On more thanone occasion, strong formations of enemy aircraft were prevented by our fightersfrom dive-bombing our lines and, on others, armoured attacks on our defendedpositions; were halted.German effort, especially by dive bombers, was substantially increased.Attacks were made on M.T. concentrations in the forward area and on ourlanding grounds between Mersah Matruh and El Daba but, in general, the mainenemy activity was directed to the provision of air cover and assistance for the axis ground forces.*Malta.39. Between the 11th and 18th, a total of approximately 100 hostile aircraft(mainly fighter-bombers) operated against the Island by day and about 35 at night. In general, the damage caused was negligible. Five enemy aircraft were destroyed and the same number damaged. Two Spitfires were lost but the pilotsof. both are safe.Russia.40. No information has been received regarding air operations during theperiod under review.Burma.41. Blenheims made a low level attack on Akyab harbour and a UnitedStates aircraft bombed the waterfront at Homalin.Supplies were dropped at Imphal, Tapak and Shinbwiyang, and UnitedStates aircraft completed the evacuation of Fort Hertz.Pacific Zone.42. A total of 15 U.S.A. Fortresses made four attacks on aerodromes atRabaul, bombs being seen to fall on buildings and amongst parked aircraft at theVunakanau aerodrome.Three U.S.A. Fortresses started large fires among the aerodrome buildings at Lae, and this target was attacked later on the same day by ten U.S.A.Marauders. The Fortresses destroyed one enemy fighter and U.S.A. fighters shot down a further three for the loss of one Airacobra.Seven Hudsons bombed Koepang aerodrome, and a Catalina attackedbuildings on Sohana Island (Solomons).Reconnaissance aircraft destroyed an enemy fighter and a flying boat.Twenty-eight enemy fighters approaching Port Moresby were intercepted by .S.A. fighters, which damaged two for the loss of four Airacobras. One pilotis safe.Australia.43. A total of 71 enemy bombers and 67 fighters made four attacks onDarwin, inflicting damage on naval oil cisterns and storehouse installations.U.S.A. Kittyhawks destroyed 11 enemy fighters and probably destroyed a furthertwo aircraft.   Nine Allied fighters were lost but four pilots are safe.
HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.44. On the 13th a single enemy aircraft bombed the factory of AutomotiveProducts, Ltd., at Leamington, seriously damaging the aircraft experimentalworkshops and interfering with production for about two days.At dusk on the 12th a few bombs were dropped at King&apos;s Lynn, killing 43people, and early on the 16th a single aircraft bombed the Power Station atSouth wick (Brighton), seriously damaging supply cables.By Night.45. Incidents were confined to the south coast, and in most cases damage was slight. On the 13th/14th a parachute mine killed 11 people at Portsmouth,and on the 16th/ 17th damage was caused to roofs and windows- at the NavalHospital, Portland, but casualties were slight.Casualties.46.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week : Germany.Bremen. Photographs make possible a more detailed assessment of damageresulting from the attack on the 3rd/4th June.(i) A large warehouse on Barkhausen Quay and part of the OelfabrikGross-Gerau building on Hansa Quay are gutted,(ii) Three large buildings, possibly belonging to the Bremen BesigheimerOelfabriken. in the Bremerhaven Strasse, are completely destroyed.(iii) Two large tanks and the blast wall of the Mineral Oil Refinery on theFranzius Quay are destroyed.(iv) Eight   bays   of   a   two-bay   factory   building   north-east   of   theHolz &amp; Fabriken Hafen are destroyed or seriously damaged,(v) A large part of the Slaughter House north of the Main Railway station is destroyed.In addition, a considerable amount of residential property has been destroyed or seriously damaged.The Ruhr. On the 7th June the railway services between Essen-Bochum andEssen-Mulheim were still severely affected and eighty lorries were assisting in themaintenance of essential services.Cologne. Consequent upon the attack on the 30th/31st May, it was four days before any goods trucks arrived at Basle from Cologne, and by the 6th Juneonly one passenger train (instead of the usual six) was running between Basleand Cologne.  Travel on the Cologne-Basle line was subject to very strict control.Occupied Territory.Lannion. Photographs taken during an attack ori the 10th June show thefollowing damage to the bomber aerodrome :  (a) Six large and twenty-five smaller bomb bursts in the N.E. dispersal area,the majority being direct hits on the taxi tracks.(&amp;) Five large and at least twenty-five smaller bursts about 33 yards from arow of four Ju. 88&apos;s, one a direct hit on the perimeter track.(c) Four large bursts on the landing ground.(d) Five large and at least thirty smaller bursts in the S. dispersal area, themajority on the taxi tracks.(e) Four bursts on the runway.Ostend. A direct hit on the S.E. corner of the Ostend power station isshown by photographs taken during the attack on the 5th June. Several hits onthe east bank of the Bruges Canal near the power station are also visible, and itis possible that these caused damage to the tramway track.Sea Mining.The German Stockholm of 618 tons was damaged by a mine off Texel on the15th April.On the 12th June the Swedish Bojan of 2,170 tons was damaged by a minewhile on her way to Germany. She managed to reach Sassnitz, but on the 14thshe sank.
The Swedish Ragnar Corthon of 1,848 tons had to ask for tug assistance onthe 10th June while at the southern entrance to the Sound, and, on the same date,a German steamer was sunk. In this second case the sinking is stated to have occurred in the Southern Baltic off the German coast.Early in April two small vessels were mined and sunk, one at the mouth ofthe Elbe, and the other in the Jade river.One of the larger German minesweepers was damaged by a near mineexplosion on the 23rd April at the north end of the Little Belt.The ship ferry services between Kalundborg and Aarhus, and betweenHelsingborg and Helsingoer, were temporarily suspended on the 10th June owingto mines, while ferry services between Korsoer and Nueborg, across the GreatBelt, could only be made at the travellers risk.\
