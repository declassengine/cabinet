draft White paperFuSL rationingHis Majesty&apos;s Government, after full consideration of the views expressed in the Debate in the Mouse of Commons on 7th May, have decided on the following scheme of fuel rationing.(l) In order to secure an equitable distribution of fuel, as well asa necessary reduction in the total domestic consumption, all consumersof solid fuel must be registered with a coal merchant or distributor. AnOrder to this effect has already been made.    This will enable available supplies of coal and coke to be distributed between merchants roughly in proportion to the number of their registered customers. &apos;(2) There will be a fuel ration for each householdj and, in addition,a fuel ration for each person, including Children.(3) The ration will be fixed in cvrfc. of coal.    But a consumer can take part of his ration in other fuels - coke, gas, electricity orparaffin.    These will be interchangeable according to a points system onthe basis that - 1 cwts of coal or coke equals 5 therms of gas or 100 unitsof electricity or 2 gallons of paraffin.(4) The household ration will be fixed for each household by an assessment of present needs according tc a simple scale as shown below, (parai.17)The ration will depend on -(a) The locality of the household.    For climatic reasons, a higherscale will be given for Scotland and the North of England than for the Midlands which in turn will have a higher scale thanLondon and the South.(b) The number of habitable rooms in the house.(excluding scullories,bathrooms etc.;(d) In the case.of houses with more than seven habitable rooms,  i/henumber of residents-The making of these assessments will be a very simple matterinvolving no exercise of judgment by any official, but only the tabulationof facts.    85 per cent, of all households contain seven habitable roomsor less.(5) The personal ration will be the same for all persons whether young -or old.    It will be 7-g- cwt. a year per head.    Thus a family of fourpersons will be entitled to a total personal ration of 1-g- tons in additionto their household ration.(6) A supplementary ration may also be given for special needs, suchas sickness necessitating additional fuel, bomb damage, the use of a house for business premises, etc.    These supplementary rations will begranted by the Local Fuel Overseer.    They are the only part of the rationwhich requires the exercise of discretion by any official, and even thiswill be largely reduced by the issue of simple rules dealing with the mostcommon cases.(7) The question of miners&apos; coal will be specially dealt with, after full consultation with representatives of miners and mine owners.-(8) Any householder applying for a supplementary ration who is not satisfied with the decision of the Local Fuel Overseer, will, in accord with rules to be made by the Board of Trade, have a right of appeal.

(9) The rationing period for coal) coke and paraffin will begin on the1st July 1942 and will run to the 1st July 1943*   All coal, coke andparaffin delivered to the householder on or after 1st July 1942 will count against his ration for these twelve months.    Likewise, any stocks ofcoal or coke in excess of one ton held on 1st July 1942 will count againstthe ration.   Within the limits of their ration, householders will be encouraged to stock up during the sunsmer months.(10) The rationing period for gas and electricity will also run fromapproximately 1st JuTy, i.e. from the first quarterly meter readingafter 1st October.(li) During any half year, electricity consumption in any householdmust not exceed the consumption in the corresponding six months of theprevious year, except with the consent of the Local Fuel Overseer.(l2) Any small excess of consumption of electricity or gas, overthe amounts permitted under either (3) or (ll), will be reported tothe Local Fuel Overseer and carried forward and deducted from the ration in the next period.   Any larger excess may be subject, on theinitiative of the Local Fuel Overseer, to prosecution and a maximumfine of, say, ten times the price per unit of the excess.    In casesof flagrant and deliberate excess, supplies will be cut off, if soordered by the Court.    It is not anticipated that such cases will be atall common.(13) Establishments, i. e. buildings other than domestic or industrial premises viz. schools, hospitals, hotels, business offices, shops,restaurants &quot;and places of entertainment, etc., will be rationed onthe basis of their consumption of fuel in a preceding period.     The amountof the reduction will be determined by the Local Fuel Overseer with aright of appeal.    In exceptional circumstances an increase may beallowed.In addition to rationing, establishments will be subject to restrictions directed to prevent extravagant or unnecessary use ofheat and light.An Order restricting advertisement lighting has been made by theBoard of Trade.(14) Fuel rationing can only operate fairly and effectively by meansof coupons, but steps will be taken to minimise any inconvenience whichthe use of these may cause.   Each householder will have a ration bookfrom which coupons will be detached.    Further, each person receivesa clothing ration book by 1st June and may use any of the 15 sparecoupons which it contains to purchase -g- -cwt. of coal or the equivalent of other fuels.    This is the personal ration mentioned in (5) above.Coupons will only be required to be handed over for gas and electricity when payment is made by cash or cheque.   For solid fuelcoupons may; if preferred, be deposited with the order.    But otherwisecoupons will always go with the money.    This will remove many difficulties.    Thus meter readers will only need to collect couponswhen they collect cash.   All alternative arrangements which havebeen suggested are more cumbrous and more open to evasion and fraud.In order to save labour for the gas and electricity companiesarrangements should be made whereby the same person reads both the gas and electricity meters.    Such an arrangement is already in force as between the Gas 16 ght and Coke Company and the County of LondonElectric Supply Company.

(15)     It is estimated that a permanent staff required throughout thecountry for the administration of fuel rationing will mean, on anaverage, an addition of less than two persons for each of the 1,600 LocalFuel Offices.     That is to say, ah addition of some 3,000 in all,including headquarters staff.Further, for a period of six weeks to two months, some 8,000 temporaryclerks will he required at the Local Fuel Offices to make assessments forhousehold rations and to issue the household ration books.     Most of thistemporary staff would be borrowed, under the existing arrangements fordovetailing staff between Government Departments, from the Ministry ofFood,     They will just have completed their work on food ration books andwill, therefore/ be available during July and August for similar work on fuel rationings     The great majority of the staff, both permanent and temporary, will consist of girl clerks, with some elderly persons.      some temporary staff will also be drawn from Civil Defence Services.(l6)     In support, and in explanation, of fuel rationing there will bea sustained campaign of publicity.     There will be an educationalcampaign in fuel economy among householders in methods of reducing and controlling their consumption by saving waste and reading their gas and electric metersn     An Advisory Committee on publicity&apos; including representatives of consumers and of the industries will be set up;(17)     The following is a provisional scale of household rations expressedin terms of coal, to which must be added both the personal rations of all members of the household under (5) and-, any supplementary rations under (6),Number of                Scotland and Midlands South ofRooms North of EnglandEnglandcwt. of coal per year.1                      40 30                    252                       . M 4-0                       303                           55 -45                        354                          60 55                        405                           70 60                        456                           75 65                        507                           85 70                        55Thus the total ration for a five roomed house with four people, eachof whom is entitled to 7q cwt. a year as personal ration, would be 5 tonsin the North, 4sf tons in the Midlands, 3^ tons in the South.     Anysupplementary ration would be additional to these figures.The larger houses with eight rooms or more Will not receive a largerration than the seven roomed houses, unless they have sufficient residentsto justify it, or there are other special circumstances.     The general rule is that an extra, room over seven should only count if there are atleast four residents, over eight if there are at least five, and so on.The additional amount allowed per room, subject to these conditions for larger houses, should be 15 cwt. in Scotland raid the North, 12-g- cwt. inthe Midlands, and 10 cwt. in the South.     As an alternative, if the householder satisfies the Local Fuel Overseer that his previousconsumption was not unduly high, it will not be cut by more than 33 jper cent.These scales will, it is estimated, produce the total savingrequired, (10 million tons of coal in a full year).     They will involve no reduction for about a quarter of the total households.     The remainingthree-quarters will receive rations less than their present consumption.

6*6(18)   The scheme is a simple one and the duties of the ordinaryhouseholder may he summed up as.follows:-(i) Register with a supplier for coal and for coke, if hehas not already cone so.(ii) Pill in the application form which will he sent to him and return it to the Local Fuel Office.    The questions that be will have to answer are outlined in (19) below.(iii) Give up coupons for all coal, coke and paraffin boughtafter 1st July 1942 and for gas and electricity usedquarter by quarter starting with the first meter readingafter 1st October 1942.(19)   Outline of the householders application form.1.
