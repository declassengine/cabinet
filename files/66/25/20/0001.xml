I have discussed this question with some of my colleagues andwe have come to the conclusion that assistance should, not be with-held from such organisations, merely because some individualsconnected with them also have, or have had in the past, connections with the Communist Party,      Organisations of this nature are bound,to appeal to persons who, at one time or another, may have beenattracted by Communism;    and to discourage the Organisations onthat account would, in our opinion, be to invite them to seolc fromthe Communist Party that guidance and assistance which they weredenied by the Government 04.     In our view the test should be whether or not an organisation is in practice controlled,or materially influenced or directed bya Political Party or is boing run to serve the interests of aPolitical Party,      If not, wo consider that it should receive thesame measure of assistance as would bo granted to any other organ-isation run on non-party lines for a commendable object,5*     If the War Cabinet endorse this view, I will arrange for instructions to be issued accordingly to the Departments concerned.6*eat George Street, S.W,10,5th June, 1942c
