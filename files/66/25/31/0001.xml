NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. A Japanese attack on Midway Island has been repulsed by UnitedStates forces with heavy losses to the enemy.Two U-boats have been sunk in the Mediterranean.U-boat and raider activity is reported from new areas in the Pacific and indian Oceans, and shipping losses have been heavy.Home Waters and North Atlantic.2. Light patrol craft engaged enemy patrol craft, including torpedo boats,off the French and Belgian coasts on the nights of the 5th/6th and 6th/7th; onthe latter night M.T.B. 70 torpedoed an enemy torpedo boat. M.T.B. 30 wasbadly damaged and her Captain was killed.Another brush between patrols occurred on the night 8th/9th off Gravelineswith inconclusive results.The Free French Corvette Mimosa was torpedoed and sunk in mid-Atlanticwhilst escorting an outward-bound convoy.  There were four survivors.Mediterranean.3. H.M. Submarine Turbulent, during a recent patrol on the shippingroutes to Benghazi, sank a Navigatori Class (1,600 tons) destroyer, a 4,000-tonand two smaller merchant ships, a 500-ton schooner, and, while returning to herbase, a 500-ton U-boat.H.M. Destroyer Janus was slightly damaged by a mine off Alexandria onthe 4th.H.M. Whaler Cocker was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat off Bardia on the3rd.  The Captain and fifteen of the crew were rescued.A reinforcement of aircraft for Malta, consisting of 32 Spitfires, was flownoff from H.M. aircraft-carriers on the 9th.On the 10th, off Malta, H.M. Drifter Trusty Star was sunk by a mine, her crew being saved; M.L. 126 shot down one Me. 109 and damaged another on thesame day.During the week 11,000 tons of French merchant shipping passed eastboundthrough the Straits of Gibraltar.Pacific.4. On the 3rd June four Japanese bombers, escorted by 13 fighters, attackedDutch Harbour in the Aleutian Islands with negligible results. A second attack was made on the 5th, on which day LJnited States army bombers attacked forcesconsisting of two aircraft-carriers, three cruisers and two destroyers, some ofwhich were operating to the north and some to the south of the islands. Onecarrier is reported to have been hit by a bomb whilst her aircraft were airborne.Strong opposition was encountered. The Japanese withdrew and the last reportof their forces was on the 7th. when they were 200 miles west of Dutch Harbour.Midway Island was attacked by enemy forces of carrier-borne aircraft anda U-boat on the 4th. The naval forces concerned were in two groups, one which included two battleships and four carriers approached from the north-west, andthe other with two battleships approached from the west. The north-westerngroup was attacked by shore-based aircraft, which were later joined by carrier-borne aircraft. Operations continued until the evening of the 7th. Contact wasthen lost with the enemy, who had been retiring westward during the day, harriedby aircraft and pursued by surface forces.The Japanese are reported to have lost four carriers, two heavy cruisers, a destroyer and four transports, in addition to three battleships, three heavycruisers, four transports and a number of destroyers damaged.Apart from one aircraft-carrier torpedoed by a submarine, all the Japanesecasualties were from air attack.One United States destroyer was sunk. Aircraft casualties are believed tohave been heavy on both sides.
Anti-Submarine Operations.5. In addition to the U-boat sunk by H.M. Submarine Turbulent, a Catalinaaircraft sank an Italian U-boat south of Majorca on the 9th.Aircraft are known to have seriously damaged an Italian U-boat offSantander on the 7th, and another of unknown nationality to the westward ofFinisterre on the 11th. Aircraft made 19 other attacks; hits being claimedor possible damage being reported in three cases in the Mediterranean and thveein the Far East. Fourteen surface attacks have been reported, nine of them fromthe West Atlantic.Enemy Intelligence.Germany.6. Photographic reconnaissance during the week shows that the Aircraft-Carrier Graf Zeppelin is to outward appearance complete. If this is the caseextensive trials will be necessary before the ship is ready for operations. the 8-inch cruiser Prinz Eugen has been seen in dry dock at Kiel having her newstern-piece fitted.Italy.7. The bulk of the Italian naval forces were seen concentrated at Tarantoon the 9th; these included two Littoria and three Cavour Class battleships,two 8-inch cruisers and two 6-inch cruisers. Two other 6-inch cruisers were seen at Cagliari, Sardinia. Photographic reconnaissance on the 10th showedtwo 8-inch cruisers, one 6-inch cruiser, one new 5-3-inch cruiser and six destroyers at Spezia.  At Leghorn one 5-3-inch cruiser is nearing completion.No ships have arrived at Benghazi during the past week, and only three havearrived at Tripoli. Traffic with small coastal ships between Tripoli and Benghazihas continued.U-boats.8. For the first time since U-boats began to operate in United States waters,they have attacked escorted shipping. The convoy from Boston to Halifax was attacked in the Gulf of Maine and one ship was damaged, and the convoy fromTrinidad to Aruba lost two ships.The number of U-boats operating in the Atlantic has remained at the same level (about 45), but that a considerable number are on passage to or from theiroperating areas. In the South Atlantic the situation is rather obscure. U-boatactivity has been reported south-west of Ascension..9. Since the attack on Sydney Harbour by midget U-boats on the 31st Maythere has been an outbreak of Japanese U-boat activity off the New South Walescoast. There are probably three or four U-boats in the area, and these mayhave come either from the Japanese New Guinea Force or from the 6th (Submarine)Fleet consisting of about 25 U-boats, which is stationed at Jaluit in the MarshallIslands. Three or four Japanese U-boats have been operating in the MozambiqueChannel. These presumably belong to the squadron based at Penang, which isbelieved to number about sixteen.Raiders.10. There is further evidence of a German raider working in the south atlantic. In the Indian Ocean two Japanese raiders have attacked shipping tothe south of the Mozambique Channel. Survivors from the British Elysia (6,757tons), which was sunk on the 5th, describe them as fast merchant ships of 15,000and 8,000 tons, heavily armed and probably equipped with float planes and possiblytorpedo tubes.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending 10th June 1,110 ships, including 258 allied and 24 neutral, have been convoyed.One armed merchant cruiser, one ocean boarding vessel, 3 anti-aircraft ships,58 destroyers (including three United States destroyers) and 98 sloops, cutters[23944] B
and corvettes were employed on escort duty. Several convoys are now in operation on the east coast of the United States but details of these are not included in thefigures.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending6th June, totalled 620,000 tons compared with 534,000 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 613,000 tons for the past ten weeks. Of the weeksimports 192,000 tons&apos; were oil of various grades.Imports into the United Kingdom during April (other than tanker imports)totalled 2,136,400 tons.Imports under the Ministry of Food were : grain and pulses 382,200 tons;animal feeding stuffs 4,500 tons; meat 166,800 tons; oilseeds, nuts, &amp;c. 246,300tons; sugar 100,100 tons; dairy produce 68,600 tons; fruit and vegetables 32,000;fish 37,300 tons; tea, coffee and cocoa 47,100 tons; beer, wines and spirits 200tons; miscellaneous 12.400; total (including 34,800 from Eire) 1,133,300 tons.Imports under the Ministry of Supply programme were : iron and alliedmetals 406,500 tons; non-ferrous ores and metals 116,400 tons; timber 67,900tons; textiles 84,500 tons; paper and pulp 48,400 tons; acid and fertilisermaterials 125,000 tons; miscellaneous 100,900; total 949,600 tons.Imports under the Board of Trade programme were : tobacco 4,900 tons;aircraft 1,400 tons; other vehicles 4,100 tons; machine tools 6,600 tons; othermachinery 5,500 tons; miscellaneous &apos;28,200; total (including 2,800 tons from eire) 53,500 tons.Enemy Attack on Trade.12. During the period 25 ships, including three tankers, are reported to havebeen attacked by U-boats and of these 10, including two tankers, are known tohave sunk. Five of these attacks occurred in the South Atlantic, six in the carribbean and adjacent waters, and four in the North Atlantic. In other areas,four attacks took place in the Mozambique Channel, one off Mombasa, two offsouth-east Australia, one off Vancouver Island and two in the Eastern Medi-terranean.There were two attacks by raider at the south end of the MozambiqueChannel. A third attack, 900 miles W.S.W. of Freetown, was most probablymade by a raider but confirmation of this is Lacking.Shipping losses from enemy action during May 1942, as recorded to date,totalled 668,000 gross tons, which is the second highest monthly total for thewar, and is likely to be increased by delayed reports. Ocean convoys suffered more heavily than of late.U-boats accounted for 588,000 gross tons or 88 per cent, of the total.The bulk of the losses, about 571,000 gross tons, occurred in the Atlantic.Details are given in Appendix I.British Minelaying.13. During the week some mines were laid off the French Channel coast by surface craft and minelaying by aircraft has continued off the German north sea coast.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.14. German aircraft laid mines on two nights off the east coast of Englandand on two other nights off the south coast.E-boats are thought to have laid mines off the south coast on two nights.Thirty magnetic and four acoustic mines have been destroyed, all exceptthree of them off the east coast.The mine totals, including those in foreign waters, now are : 2,132 magnetic,1,283 acoustic and 1,278 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.15. The German Joao Pessoa (3,023 tons), which has been shipping ore from spain to Occupied France, is reported to have struck a rock off San Sebastian on 7th June and to have sunk.   She was fully loaded at the time.The Russians claim to have sunk the Roumanian Suceava (6,876 tons) in the black Sea.
MILITARY SITUATION.Libya.16. The attack on Bir Hakeim was maintained during the 4th June. Thedefence was considerably assisted by the work of our mobile columns in harassingthe enemy forces to the north-west and north-east of Bir Hakeim itself,17. During the following night and the early morning of the 5th an attack was launched against enemy positions between Mteifel and Knightsbridge. the initial objective the enemy anti-tank screen was achieved, but the attackinginfantry were later compelled to withdraw in the face of heavy counter-attacks.All units fought well and much gallantry was shown. Considerable losses wereinflicted on the enemy during the action, but we ourselves also suffered casualties.The Bir Hakeim position was meanwhile firmly held, the defending troopsdisplaying throughout the greatest courage and resolution. Their defence wasaided by the co-operation of the R.A.F.18. On the morning of the 6th a tank battle developed in the Knightsbridgearea. This battle raged all the morning and was renewed in the evening whenfresh armoured units were sent forward. These compelled the enemy to with-draw westwards after inflicting losses on his armour. The enemy were stillunable to make any headway in the Bir Hakeim area.19. The following day (the 7th) enemy infantry, with tanks in support,formed up to attack our defended locality in the area of Knightsbridge. the infantry advance was checked by heavy and accurate artillery fire and no tankattack developed before nightfall, although the enemy remained in the neighbour-hood. The enemy forward movement was resumed next morning but no seriousaction took place.20. Bir Hakeim was subjected to further attacks both on the 7th and the8th, those on the latter day being specially severe. The outer perimeter was brokenat one point, but the situation was restored completely by a Free French counter-attack the following day. During the night of the 10th/11th the Free french were withdrawn from Bir Hakeim, and by 0800 hours the 11th, 2,000 men were clear of the position, having fought their way out.21. Throughout the week the enemy&apos;s supply lines have been continuallyharassed by our mobile columns to the west of our original forward defences andin the area of Rotunda Segnali. Serious damage has been inflicted on hisM.T. and several tanks have been destroyed.India.Assam Frontier.22.   There has been no contact with the enemy.Russo-German Campaign.23. Fighting has been local along the whole front, except in the Crimea,where the Germans have opened the expected land assault on Sevastopol. TheRussian General Staff reports that the Germans have not gained a single footof ground. The estimated total of German divisions on the Russian front is nowraised to 184.Finland.24. Hitler&apos;s visit to Finland, added to earlier indications of movements oftroops to that country and of tank landing craft to Northern Norway, strengthensthe possibility of operations on the Finnish front,Two divisions have moved or are in process of moving from Germany andthe Baltic .States to Finland. The total of German divisions in Finland is thusraised to seven.
AIR SITUATION.General.25. Our bombing attacks on Germany and Occupied Territory were on asmall scale, but sea-mining in enemy waters was increased.In Libya our air forces provided support for our ground forces.United Kingdom.26.   Fighter Command flew 4,393 sorties by day and 545 by night.Enemy day activity against this country was on a small scale, but overlandreconnaissance was more frequent than last week. A few bombs were droppedalong the south coast.Enemy night effort over this country was confined to some scattered andineffective raids.   Our night fighters destroyed six enemy aircraft.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.27. Fighter and Bomber Commands despatched 2,144 and 83 sorties respectively, compared with 2,692 and 40 last week.Ten bombing operations were carried out by 59 Bostons and 36 Hurricanebombers, escorted by a total of 72 squadrons of Spitfires. The principal targets were the docks at Boulogne, Dunkirk and Bruges, aerodromes at Morlaix, Lannionand Maupertus, and the electric power stations at Havre and Ostend.Photographs taken during the attacks on the power stations show one direct hiton the main building and ten among subsidiary buildings at Havre, and onedirect hit on the main building at Ostend.Small-scale attacks were made on aerodromes and rail communications byWhirlwinds and Spitfires.Fighter sweeps involving 82 squadrons of Spitfires were flown over theEnglish Channel, Northern France and Belgium.During these operations our fighters destroyed 13 enemy fighters, probably destroyed 13 and damaged 30. We lost 18 Spitfires and 1 Boston, but 4 fighterpilots are safe.Night.28. Bomber Command despatched 644 aircraft against land targets,compared with 2,618 last week. A total of 291 tons of H.E. and 662 tons ofincendiaries were dropped.Essen was attacked on two nights by a total of 247 aircraft, which dropped138 tons of H.E. and 356 tons of incendiaries. The weather was good, but groundhaze and intense searchlight activity made identification of ground features verydifficult. Many scattered fires were seen in the Essen area, including a large one in the Krupps works.Ninety-four tons of H.E. and 262 tons of incendiaries were dropped onEmden.Photographs taken on the following day show that several important industrial buildings were destroyed (see Appendix VII).Among other objectives bombed were the docks at Dieppe and aerodromes in Holland.Twelve aircraft were engaged in dropping leaflets over the Ruhr, and overFrench and Belgian towns, including Paris, Amiens, Dieppe and Brussels.Fighter Command despatched 60 aircraft to attack aerodromes and rail communications in Occupied Territory.In these operations we last 39 bombers and one fighter.Coastal Operations.29. Coastal Command flew 590 sorties, 59 of which were on convoy escort.Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 991 sorties.A Hudson scored a hit with a bomb on a 1,500-ton merchant vessel off the frisian Islands.Spitfires attacked shipping off the Belgian coast.  An R-boat was sunk.One hundred and twelve aircraft of Bomber Command laid 289 sea mines in enemy waters.   One aircraft is missing.
Mediterranean.Libya, Egypt and Crete.30. Throughout the week our air forces have continued to provide their maximum support in the land battles. Low-flying attacks by light bombers,fighter bombers and fighters were again directed against enemy supply columnsand concentrations, and a substantial number of enemy vehicles were destroyed or damaged.The fighter-bomber effort made in the Bir Hakeim area was considerable. Inone instance a tank attack on our positions was halted by air action, and duringone day alone about 100 vehicles, including five tanks, were destroyed or damaged;intense A.A. fire was encountered, and seven of our aircraft were shot down.Hurricanes and Bombays dropped supplies for the defending troops.Our fighters also carried out offensive patrols over the battle front, providedprotection for shipping, and escorted bombers and reconnaissance aircraft.Nineteen of our fighters were shot down but some of the pilots have returnedto our lines. Twenty-seven enemy aircraft were destroyed, 11 probably destroyed and 35 damaged.At night our bombers attacked aerodromes at Martuba and Derna, and the harbour installations at Benghazi. Two attacks were made on aerodromes inCrete and large fires were reported at Heraklion.The main enemy effort, which increased towards the end of the week, was directed against Bir Hakeim, where no particular success was achieved andmany Ju. 87&apos;s were destroyed. Intensive reconnaissance was made of our forwardaerodromes, of shipping in Tobruk harbour, and aircraft were reported over Port.Said and Alexandria. Generally, the initiative in air operations rested withthe R.A.F., and as far as land operations were concerned no decisive part wasplayed by the enemy air forces.At night, bombers based in Greece and Crete attacked our aerodromes,shipping in Tobruk, troops and concentrations of mechanical transport.The scale of effort of the enemy units fell to about 50 per cent, of that of theprevious week.Malta.31. Small formations of enemy aircraft made daily sweeps over the Island,but little damage was caused.Spitfires successfully attacked the raiders and destroyed 15, probably destroyed six and damaged 15. Our own casualties were two missing and ty/odestroyed, but three of the pilots are safe.On the 9th, reinforcements of 32 Spiptfires arrived safely at Malta.Sardinia.32. Seven Wellingtons from Malta attacked shipping and other targets atCagliari.   Many fires were caused near the barracks.Italy.33. On three nights a total of 23 Wellingtons from Malta dropped bombsat Tarantd. A smoke screen covered the harbour, but bombs burst in the vicinity of the target, and large fires were seen in the dockyard area.Russia.German Air Force Operations.34. It is estimated that the strength of the German Air Force engaged onthe Russian front is now about 2,400 LE. aircraft, of which some 1,400 are probably operating in the south. The number of aircraft engaged in Russia hasincreased slightly during the last few weeks, due to reinforcements which may havebeen transferred from the Mediterranean area.The chief centre of operations is still in the Crimea, although it has nowmoved from Kerch to Sebastopol, where the Germans are apparently trying tueliminate Russian resistance in the peninsula.
Air activity in the Kharkov sector has been on a reduced scale for the past week or two, no doubt as a result of the need for replacements and repairs follow-ing the intensive operations in that area during May.The high proportion of the G.A.F. located in South Russia would seem to preclude large-scale air operations on the Moscow and Leningrad fronts, at anyrate for the present.Burma and India.35. United States Fortresses bombed the docks and shipping at Rangoon,but results were not observed. Blenheims bombed the harbour at Akyab, wherethe jetty was hit and near misses obtained on a 900-ton armed motor vessel and a4,000-ton merchant vessel.Enemy troop concentrations at Homalin and Kelewa and shipping on the chindwin River were attacked by Wellingtons, Blenheims and Mohawks.United States transport aircraft, escorted by fighters, dropped supplies atTapakga and Imphal.Hudsons carried out several reconnaissances of North Burma and of the bay of Bengal.Enemy aircraft reconnoitred the Chittagong area and Eastern Bengal.Pacific Zone.36. A total of six United States Fortresses made two attacks on Rabaul,where fires were started at the wharves. Other Allied bombers attacked Lae andSalamoa.In Timor, Hudsons bombed the barracks at Atamboea and an enemyconcentration at Ermera.Enemy aircraft made reconnaissances of the Buna and Cape Nelson areas ofNew Guinea.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.37. A few bombs were dropped at Bournemouth on the 6th, at Torquay onthe 7th and at East Wittering on the 9th, without serious effect.During the evening of the 6th, a bomb, which is believed to have been dropped on the lOth/llth May, 1941, exploded and demolished four houses in GurneyStreet, Southwark.   Nineteen people were killed and 51 seriously injured.By Night.38. There was some scattered bombing in Durham, Yorkshire and Suffolkon the 4th/5th and some slight damage was caused at Sunderland and Lowestoft.On the 6th/7th bombs were dropped in and around Canterbury. A few fires were started, but little damage was done. On the 9th/10th there were a few incidents in Norfolk and some slight damage was caused at Great Yarmouth.Casualties.39. Estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 on the 10th Junewere 35 killed and 68 injured.
