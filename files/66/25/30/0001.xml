4 C&apos;TlflS DOCulEENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITAMTIC MAJESTY&apos; S (W1KHMEHTSECRETVr,p. (42) 250June 10, 1942ccFf no.29WAR CABINET FORT ON PUBLIC PEELINGlemorandum bv the Minister of information am presenting this report in accordance with Minute 1. of the49th Conclusions of the Far Cabinet.     Its purpose is to keep the War cabinet informed of any major movements of public feeling iii the country so far asthey can be related to questions of publicity on the home front.There is no question that there has been a big rise in optimisticfeeling about the war.     The confidence which was lacking at the time of my previous memorandum (W.P. (42) 155) has been regained and the sense offrustration which was so noticeable a feature of the early months of theyear has gone.     One sign&apos; of returning confidence is the virtual disappearance of the complaints about defects in our production machinery which were somarked a feature of the early months.     The reasons appear to be the obviousones; lack of further Axis successes, absence of any German advances in theEast, the return of summer and the reduced, incidence of the black-out.     Thescale and success of the R.A.P. raids on Cologne and Essen had, of course,a profound effect in the stimulation of public confidence.One marked feature of this steadily mounting wave of optimism- is a belief,reported from many quarters, that the war against Germany will &quot;be over thisyear.     The emergence of a similar belief lias been noted in the U.S.A. and theleaders in that country have been setting themselves to combat this feelingand to warn their public that there is still a long and hard task ahead ofthen before victory.     It is a question whether similar action is called for from the Government of this country,     It is true that a belief cf this sort may lead to a slackening of effort or a melancholy reaction if someunexpected disaster occurs:   but it is equally true that after the longwinter of discontent a wave of optimism is a pleasant raid heartening tilingand it does people good to feel it.     In the absence of any satisfactoryevidence that it is slackening up the war effort I recommend that theGovernment does not take any action to counteract this influence which will no doubt run its course and that members of the Government confine themselvesto a prudent avoidance of public statements that are likely to give itdefinite reinforcement,I think that no small part in the great public satisfaction at the recentR.A.F, raids was due to the consciousness that they were a. blow struckdirectly by this country with its own material and its own forces.     Thereis much feeling that the public have been asked for too long to acjmircRussian resistance, American production and Empire fighting qualities.Events and a very na-tural desire to pay tribute to the efforts of our friends and allies have brought, this about&apos; but the result has beenmifortunaie, not merely at home but in America, and elsewhere.     I feel that now is the right moment decisively to oorrect this impression.     This is allthe more important because before long American participation, which wall nodoubt be accompanied by&apos;Jvraericon x^ublicity, will tend to restore the oldunsatisfactory position.     I recommend strongly, therefore, that it bomaintained as a major publicity aim of the Government to bring forward andpublicise every aspect which illustrates the magnitude of our owncontribution to the war effort:     in fighting, in resources, in personnel, .in production and in civil adjustment.     But pao^iculaarly in production.A
10th June, 194-2li.. The current question relating to coal raid fuel attracted -very widespreadattention in the country.     The first wave of feeling reflected considerablediscontent at&apos; the idea of one more rationing cysten being imposed on domestic (economy and a sense of irritation with the Government that circumstances havemade this necessary,   A readiness to grumble about a new rationing systen doesnot necessarily mean that rationing will not ultimately be preferred to cnyother ].icthod.of limiting fuel consumption.    It is too early to provide airyasscGsmcnt of yjublic feeling with regard, to the Wliito Paper, which lias still to be debated in Parliament, but it is to be noted that the Yi/hite Paper hasmade it an inherent part of the Governments schenc that the ne:ct few months should be occupied by a sustained publicity campaign in favour of voluntaryrestrictiens.     It is necessary to point out that the next throe or four monthsrepresent the most difficult period for rmy systeiA of voluntary appeals tomake much impact, since they arc not periods when fuel consumption is animportant matter of daily life,     when, with colder weather raid darker hours,the subject becomes an ir.imediately practical one, voluntary appeals forsacrifices may not only be ineffective but positively harmful to morale,   1should stress, therefore, that the proposed Government publicity campaign needscareful raid considered handling and I propose as soon as possible to&quot;concert ajoint scheme for this purpose with the new&apos;Ilinister of Fuel.
