When Parliament reassembles further questions will beasked end further/representations made about the Government&apos;future policy with regard to the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;.    support for the view,that the ban on this newspaper should be liftedis not confined to II. P. s who are on  the political Left.There are others who think that the change in the attitudeof the Communist Party towards the war makes prohibition nolonger necessary and that the continuance in presentcircumstances., of the: order for suppression of this paperinvolves an undesirable interference with the freedom cfthe Press.&apos; -,2.      The view that the prohibition should be revoked hasbean expressed in a number of journals including the&quot;News Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Daily Express&quot;,   ; .e &quot;EveningStandard&quot;, the&quot;Daily Mirror&quot;,  &quot;Reynolds dews&quot;, the &quot;NewStatesman&quot;, and the &quot;Spectator&quot;.    Other papers while not definitely advocating the - revocation of the order under regulation 2D have maintained that any action ought to be-taken&apos; by means of a warning and. prosecution under Regulation2C.    This view has been advocated in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&apos;the &quot;Yorkshire Observer&quot;,  the &quot;Scotsman&quot; and the &quot;GlasgowHerald&quot;.3.      The Cornnunist Party has in&apos; its public propagandafollowed the policy laid down in Mr.  Harry Pollitt&apos;s circularletter of the 8th July, 1941, namely that the Party should give full support to the war effort &quot;without harping on thedisagreements, of the past or raising the fundamentaldifferences between the Communist Party and other politicalparities&quot;.    This does not mean that the Communist Party-has in any way abandoned its revolutionary aims, but theParty recognises that it can best strengthen its positionin the country at the present tine by championing theunited front with Russia for the defeat of Fascism andsaying little or nothing about its ultimate political-policy.    That policy continues to be the seizure of power by force whenever a suitable opportunity may arise.4.      The view urged by those who are in favour of liftingthe ban on the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; is that while they disapproveof the political views of the Communist Party, the party should not be deprived of its right to express its viewsthrough the medium of a daily paper, and that even ifprohibition were a regrettable necessity in December, 1940,it is no longer justifiable in the changed circumstances oftoday.
5...   Uy own view is that there can be no question of revc-h&apos;--the----prohibi&apos;tion immediately, but I have always had it in,..;that revocation ought to be considered at sone appropriatedate, if possible before, the end of the ... r.    If prohibit!is continued till the end of the war and  the paper, after a long period of suppression, then..bursts forth freed frorjsuch restraining influence as the present Communist war policy imposes.&apos;.and ttbh- the spocial^restrictions imposed by Defence Regulations the dangers of its use&apos; for subversi?.-purposes in the difficult1 tines: of post-war reconstructionwill-be aggravated./Whatever nay be the objections to allowing the ConnuuuParty to carry on propaganda by means of a daily paper, thiobjections arc far loss than they were in December, 1940, gonly has there been a change in the Communist attitude to tbwar but there has -been so prolonged a demonstration of aconsolidated national determination to allow nothing tointerfere with the war- effort that any apprehensions asto the risk of injury to public morale by factious  ..propaganda have been greatly allayed.If there are advantages in   lifting the ban before theend of the war, it car, be contended with considerable forcethat this step should not be unduly delayed.    The question will no doubt be raised - do the Government intend tocontinue the ban throughout the whole period of the war andif not what is the objection to lifting the ban now thatthe Communist Party are, and have been for some time, on theibest behaviour- and the national morale is such that dangersfrom querulous propaganda are small?6.      At an appropriate date, therefore,  I think the questionof a revocation order should be consider.-, by the War Cabine&apos;and the proper timing-of any such order will be a matter ofimportance.    But&apos; whatever may be the arguments for such-a future step, any immediate requests for the lifting of theban should, in my view, be resisted;    and for my guidance in framing answers to questions which i expect to be address to me in Parliament next-week I think it right to ascertain whether this view is approved   by the War Cabinet.H.M.HOME OFFICE
