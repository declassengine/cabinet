E.Foreign Office, June 3, 1942.FREE CHINA.A Survey based on Recent Rerorts.External Communications Land Transport.1. The Japanese have now reached Fort Hertz in the extreme north of burma. They occupy all strategic points on the Burma-China frontier and alsothe main routes within the Chinese border west of the Salween River.. All roadsbetween India, Burma and China are blocked, and even the more northerlyprojects, not yet at the stage of survey, are no longer feasible.2. The only possibility of land communication with India is a pack trans-port scheme through the mountains of Tibet. The Tibetan Government are hostile to any form of Chinese penetration, but the Government of India are trying to persuade them to agree. At best, however, this would be a very restricted channelfor supplies.3. There still remains the long and difficult motor road from North:WestChina through Sinkiang (Chinese Turkestan) to Russia. Russian supplies have much diminished since the war with Germany and the road is ruinous to lorries;but the Chinese, with British support, are appealing for greater help from theSoviet Government. On behalf of the Chinese, we are also trying to persuade theRussians to allow a limited amount of overseas war material to be sent viaBandar Shahpur and the Persian railway to the Caspian, and thence to join theSinkiang route to China,4. Another Chinese project is to ship goods through the Arctic Sea to northern Siberian ports, whence they would have to join the same route by river and rail through western Siberia. These schemes are of immense difficulty, andit is doubtful how far the Russians, with their other preoccupations, will be ableto co-operate.11739   [23906]
2A ir transport.5. The Calcutta-Kunming-Chungking air service for passengers and mailsis still maintained, but it carries no freight. Needless to say, there is greatdemand for accommodation and seats are difficult to obtain.6. The United States authorities operate a freight air service betweenAssam and Yunnan with a few army transport planes, and they&apos; hope shortly to expand its capacity.7. It is uncertain what facilities still exist for air travel between China and russia, but it is understood that the Chinese Eurasia planes maintain a connexionwith the Soviet air system. The Chinese Government have recently asked that theChinese National Aviation Corporation planes should be allowed to use the AlmaAta-Hami line in Chinese Turkestan. The Soviet reply is still underconsideration.Military Situation.8. In eastern China there has been very little activity recently. Lack ofsupplies and the difficulty of further replenishment have caused the Chinese high command to adopt a passive attitude and to avoid stirring up hostilities with theJapanese until the military tide turns in favour of the Allies.9. In the absence of air support, the Chinese troops sent to Burma (the 5thand 6th Armies) were not able to withstand the Japanese advance any more than our own numerically inferior forces. They are now scattered and in retreat. Themajority of the 5th Army are back in Y^unnan, where they are trying to check theenemy on the line of the Salween River: but a few are retreating in disorder intoAssam, where they are being accompanied by their American commander, GeneralStilwell. The 6th Army disintegrated on the approach of the Japanese andturned bandit. When last heard of they were looting the Chinese town ofPaoshan.10. While the Chinese forces have maintained a passive role for somemonths past, Avith the exception of the unsuccessful incursion into Burma, theirpropaganda department has been extremely active. The world has been told of chinese victories, desperate resistance, brilliant exploits, massacres of Japanese,and so on. most of which are grossly exaggerated and some entirely untrue. Inthe latter category are the recent stories of widespread guerrilla attacks on theeastern seaboard and the re-entering of Nanking. These fantasies were snbse-quently disavowed by the Chinese General Staff, but not until they had had a freerun of the British and American press. The latest reports indicate that theJapanese may themselves resume hostilities in the eastern theatre.11. In view of China&apos;s almost complete isolation, the question of herexisting stocks of military supplies is of major importance. No very reliable information on the subject is available, but the War Office estimate that, providedJapanese pressure does not increase to any great extent, and that the Chinese donot try to undertake any offensive action, the supplies now in China should last for about six months. It is thought that, at the present rate of consumption,petrol stocks will only last till the end of June.Economic situation.12. The latest reports are that, on the economic side, there is increasinglyrapid deterioration. No real attempt has been made to deal with price rises andinflation, and the official and educated classes are suffering severely. there seems to be a division of opinion about the effect on the agricultural population,who are stated in some cases to be enjoying a boom.13. The issue of savings certificates secured on the United States loan has so far proved a complete failure. Our Embassy fears that there will,&apos;in conse-quence, be a further loss of confidence in the Chinese currency; hoarding willcontinue and the economic position will become rapidly more dangerous.Chinese morale and relations with the Allies.14. After four years of courageous, if ineffective, resistance to japanese aggression, and all the horrors attendant on the occupation of vast areas by a
ruthless enemy, the first reaction of the Chinese to Pearl Harbour was one ofwild elation. After fighting so long alone it seemed that they now had powerfulfriends, and there was a general feeling that at last they could sit back for awhile and let the British and Americans finish off the Japanese.15. This hope rapidly turned to bitter disappointment with the series ofdisasters suffered by the Allies. The mood became one of acid criticism, ofwhich we were the chief victims. The ineptitude of British imperialism, thefailure to secure the loyalty of the native populations, and the rejection of(apocryphal) Chinese offers of assistance in the defence of our Malayan possessionswere the subjects of outspoken comments in the highest quarters. They founda ready audience in the United States.16. Presently the Chinese began to compare our failures with what theyhad been led to believe were their own successes against the Japanese. Thecontrast was drawn by Mme. Chiang Kai-shek and other propagandists betweenthe spectacle of the &quot; Western armies &quot; surrendering and the behaviour of theChinese forces, who, it was claimed, had never been known to surrender.Defections to the enemy by large bodies of Chinese troops were convenientlyignored, as well as the fact that the remainder owed their continued existenceto their unlimited room for retirement.17. However, that may be. the result was a rebirth of the old arrogancetoward the foreign barbarian, whose only claim to superiority in the past was his military strength, and who now showed that he could not even fight as wellas the Chinese. This feeling of superiority had the advantage of raising theChinese morale, at least temporarily, but it also led to an intolerance of foreignadvice and an almost contemptuous brushing aside of foreign, and especiallyBritish suggestions on whatever subject. Whether this self-complacency willsurvive the more recent defeat of the Chinese armies in Burma is not yet apparent,but the anti-British feeling in Chungking is likely to be intensified. The Chineseofficial attitude towards the British has been described by a Washington authority as &quot; an all time low.&quot; He admitted, however, that the American position in thisrespect was &quot; not so hot.&quot;18. Nevertheless, the new-found contempt for western military prowess iscoupled with the belief that the Allies, thanks to American production, will inthe end defeat Japan, and tha^ China will then take the latter&apos;s place as the leader of the Asiatic peoples. Not only will the Chinese no longer tolerate anywestern humiliations like extra-territoriality. but they will help the other racesof Asia to throw off the European yoke. Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s intervention in india was intensely gratifjung to the national pride and has encouraged a growinginterest in the future of Burma, Mala3^a and the Netherlands East Indies. Insuch questions the Chinese may be counted on to play the Americans against theother allies with consummate skill.19. However, these are preoccupations for the future. The victory is notyet, and. as the Chinese saying has it, &quot;in a long night there are many dreams.&quot;In the meantime the enemy has isolated the country and forced the westerngate. If Yunnan is occupied, the motor road to Chungking will provide a new approach to the capital. There have never been any signs of wavering on thepart of Chiang Kai-shek himself, and if he is driven out of Chungking he mayset up his Government still further in the west and try to carry on the struggle.But it is uncertain how many of his colleagues would follow him into thewilderness, and for all practical purposes China would be out of the fight.20. The probable consequences to the allied war effort are, difficult to assess.The immediate result in China might well be a renewal of civil war. the communists would probably oppose a compromise peace settlement and there might be a revival of provincial autonomy and misrule. It is doubtful whetherthe Japanese would be enabled to withdraw many of their troops; they wouldhave to stay and keep order if they wished to exploit the occupied territories.Apart from the loss of China as a base for an allied offensive against Japan, thefirst effect of a Chinese collapse would be chiefly psychological. But, even so, itwould be less apparent now than would have been the case while the otherf&apos;ar Eastern territories were still holding out.
21. However, it is perhaps premature to worry about this contingency. Forthe moment, the Chinese profess confidence in their ability to hold the situationin Yunnan, and if this is justified the Chungking Government may be able tomaintain themselves on their own resources for an indefinite time to come. Solong as they continue to function,.and to pay at least lip-service to the common cause, the only policy for the Allies is to remember their many admirable qualities,to overlook their less pleasant tendencies and to go on giving them all the help and encouragement that may be possible.Summary.22. The Japanese occupation of Burma has now isolated China from her allies. The only remaining supply channels from the outside are a restricted airservice with India and the long and difficult road to Russia.23. The Chinese armies in Burma are being driven out in disorder. some are retreating into Assam together with their American commander. GeneralStilwell. some are trying to hold the Salween line in Yunnan, and others have turned bandit and are looting Chinese towns.24. In China itself the lack of supplies and the difficulty of replenishmenthave led the Chinese High Command to maintain a passive attitude and toavoid stirring up the Japanese unnecessarily. At the same time Chinesepropaganda is trying to give the impression of widespread and successful actionagainst the enemy.25. The economic situation is bad and is getting worse. The issue of savingscertificates secured on the recent United States loan has proved a failure. Thereis likely to be a further loss of confidence in the national currency, and increasedhoarding.26. Chinese morale has passed through various phases since the outbreak ofthe war in the Pacific. . The acquisition of powerful friends was at first greetedwith wild elation, and there was the feeling that the Chinese could now sit back and let the British and Americans deal with Japan. This was rapidly followed bvbitter disappointment at the allied defeats and acid criticisms directed chiefly at british ineptitude. A later phase is a conviction of superiority engendered by a comparison of allied military failures with alleged Chinese successes. The atti-tu.de towards the British in official circles has developed from hostility tocontempt, and an intolerance of advice or suggestions on whatever subject.27. There is also a growing belief that when Japan is defeated China willbe able to take her place as the leader of the Asiatic peoples. The Chinese will help their neighbours to throw off the yoke of western imperialism. Hence theChinese gratification at Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s intervention, in India, and the growinginterest in the future of Burma, Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies.28. In the meantime, the Chinese profess to be confident about the situationin Yunnan, and are preparing for an expected resumption of hostilities in theprovince of Chekiang, on the eastern seaboard.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.May 23, 1942.
