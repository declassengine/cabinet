THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  June 1942.Copy No. 27WAR CABINET.&quot; FRONT LINE.&quot;Memorandum by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.BY a decision of the Civil Defence Committee, the story of the Civil Defenceof Britain against the heavy air bombardment of 1940-41 has been written inpopular form by the Ministry of Home Security in consultation with the other civil departments concerned and the Ministry of Information. From an early stage the Air Ministry was consulted semi-officially on the security aspect, andwas understood in due course to intimate that no general objection was likely tobe raised to the scope and method of the book as written. This proved to be a misunderstanding, and after the text was in galley proof form, it was learned that the Air Staff took objection to its publication on security grounds. TheCivil Defence Executive and the Ministry of Information were anxious to publish the book, and therefore, with the Secretary of State for Air, I referred thequestion to the Lord President for an opinion. He read the text and, afterdiscussing, the matter with us both, indicated that he saw no objection to publication at the present time, with certain amendments. The Secretary ofState for Air, however, felt unable to accept this view without reference to theWar Cabinet. He intimated that he might be able to agree to publication if,by the month of August, the military situation was such as to make heavy air attack on Britain in the autumn and winter unlikely : but that otherwise he must ask for a ruling by the War Cabinet.Desirous&apos; as I have been of reaching agreement on this matter withouttroubling the War Cabinet, I think that in the circumstances the question should now come before it. If it were true that the book contained information new and useful to the Germans, I should not, as Minister of Home Security, feel that publication two months hence would be justified simply because an attack inthe ensuing few months was unlikely in view of the Luftwaffe&apos;s commitmentselsewhere. No one can foresee the course of the war, and the possibility ofrenewed attack is not confined to 1942. If, on the other hand, as I believe, thebook contains nothing of substance that is not already known to the Germans,the processes of publication might commence now just as well as two monthshence.   I therefore place the question before the War Cabinet for decision. &quot; ,. ,     -* *        *      * * * *   &apos;In the Air Ministry&apos;s view the book is dangerously informative upon two matters the weaknesses of the Civil Defence Services and how those difficulties were overcome, and the reasons for the failure of the enemy&apos;s bombing strategy.On the first point, I must say categorically that every important weaknessin Civil Defence touched upon in the book and the manner of its remedy hasbeen exhaustively discussed in the Press and expounded on the wireless.   The[24013]SECRET.W.P. (42) 270.June 27, 1942.
lack of fire prevention and the development of the Fire Guard, the weaknessesin fire-fighting and the formation of the National Fire Service, the earlydifficulties in post-raid welfare work and how they were overcome nothing ofthis has been hidden from our own people or the world. The Air Ministry5sobjection to this aspect of the book appears to me to illustrate the weakness ofthe whole criticism namely, that it treats the book as though it were the onlymaterial published on its subject-matter and disregards the existence of that body of common knowledge about the air raids beyond whose limits those responsible for the book took care not to trespass to any material extent.- The Air Ministry&apos;s second point is that the book makes clear that the german attack was directed indiscriminately against civilian objectives and not selectivelyagainst economic and military ones : and that it failed. The Air Ministry believes that these propositions will point the enemy to the conclusion that he might have succeeded and might yet succeed by using his bombers to attack key targetssuch as factories and essential services, instead of devastating city centres andtrying to beat down the spirit of the citizens. On this I would make the following comments : (1) The facts of what happened are known everywhere, and have beendocumented in books and newspapers (not to speak of Ministerialspeeches) both here and in America. Some of the American accounts of the positive and negative results of raids by observers of the higheststanding are especially detailed and exact.(2) I should have thought it was now clear that the Germans indulged inindiscriminate attack not by d priori choice, but primarily because ofthe great difficulty of exact aiming at night and from a great height.(3) Is not the R.A.F. now engaged in a form of attack similar in many respects to the German raids of 1941. and differing more by its greaterweight than by its selection of objectives?(4) But if this be not accepted, if we know something about bombingstrategy which the enemy does not, and in particular if the, Luftwaffe&apos;s attacks, and their results, taught us strategical lessons ofwhich the Germans are unaware, is it not now the R.A.F.&apos;s object to drive those lessons into German minds by practical example ? Canit be contended that our book will by implication convey the correct principles of bombing strategy to better effect than the R.A.F.will demonstrate them over Germany ?There is another point I wish to make. The Censor&apos;s rules are therepository of the combined wisdom of Departments of State on security matters.The text of our book was submitted to the Censor, who was asked to apply hisrules to it very strictly, and as if it were of private authorship. As a result,more than 95 per cent, of the text was passed. Most of what fell under theCensor&apos;s ban would not trouble the Air Ministry in terms of the criticisms ithas made; and would in practice probably be made the subject of a commonsenserelaxation of the rules by agreement between the Censor and the departments.* * * * * *It is now a commonplace that the war has to be fought and won on moreplanes than the physical. It is not enough to throw general doubt for securityreasons on a propagandist enterprise. The security case must be practical, clear and definite enough to justify the suppression of a book which has an important part to play at the present stage of the war.&quot; Front Line&quot; is the story of how British men and women for nine monthsstood alone against Hitler and won a people&apos;s battle not in any ideal ormetaphorical sense, but by the defeat of the enemy&apos;s purpose in hard and bloodyfact. It is needed now as a refreshment to our own spirit, a reminder to theEmpire and to our American allies, and a contribution to that greater Russianknowledge of our war record which is now agreed to be desirable.H. M.Home Office, June 27, 1942.
