Constant pressure from the Axis was,however, forcing him in the direction of accepting their military co-operation in french Africa and seeking the eventual recovery of Equatorial Africa from theFree.French. Vichy did not intend to repeat the Syrian error of refusing toask for Axis help and General Dentz, who had refused such help at the time,took a very different view now. Laval had definitely decided to accept Germanhelp in Africa. Action was expected in French North Africa during the nextfew weeks, and a number of French general officers would be glad to accept Axismilitary equipment in order to defend French soil (against the United Nations).2. This development would be in accordance with Laval&apos;s policy. He hasstaked everything on a German victory, and will do all he can to bring it about.So far he has failed to give any satisfaction either to the Germans or to his owncountrymen, and he may well have chosen this extended military co-operation in the hope that by its means he will establish a claim to German gratitude.When he was last in power, there were indications that he had in mind some idea of &quot; German co-operation&quot; in running the French Empire.3. Petain. is now a back number and will probably be forced to acceptLaval&apos;s scheme. Darlan is unlikely to object, although he will probably still do his best not to risk the loss of French ships.4. The report about General Dentz&apos; present attitude shows that theconsideration shown him at the time of the Syrian armistice has brought us nodividend. The attitude of French general officers in North Africa should also benoted. We can expect no help from any of the French fighting services until it isclear that we are winning the war very rapidly. Meanwhile, they will obey orders to resist us, but will continue to submit to Axis demands if these are pressedwith sufficient firmness.A. E.Foreign Office.June&apos;2, 1942.11736   [23897]
