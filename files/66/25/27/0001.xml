this document IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIjPfNNNTjBjIviAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Gabwcet.  June 1942.SECRET.Copy-No^W.P. (42) 247.June 9, 1942.WAR CABINET.REPORT ON OPINION IN FRANCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a translation of a memorandumby a young Frenchman who is paying a brief secret visit to this country. Hewas formerly Parliamentary Attache to M. Mandel, whom he visits about twicea month in the fortress of Pourtalet. He also occasionally sees M. Reynaud, whois imprisoned in the same fortress. He describes both as in excellent spirits andsays that their morale is high, but that they suffer from their long confinement,each in a single small cell with only one hour&apos;s exercise in the open air each day.He also claims to have been in contact with a large number of Parliamentariansin unoccupied France. He says that M. Mandel urged him to go to London,establish contact with His Majesty&apos;s Government and acquaint them withhis views,2. This Frenchman has brought no written credentials with him fromM. Mandel. He had established contact with the Free French organisation herebefore my Department saw him and before the memorandum was written. He isan enthusiast, otherwise he would not have risked his life to come here. But,even if the views which he attributes to M. Mandel and other politicians have beencoloured by his contacts with Free French headquarters, we must neverthelessattach importance to the strong advocacy of General de Gaulle which is displayed.3. We should at the same time bear in mind that the Parliamentary regime in France is completely discredited and that politicians count for little or nothing in France to-day.4. I would invite particular attention to the paragraphs in Part II (iii) ofthe memorandum, which purport to give, the views of M. Mandel and M. Reynaud.Our visitor admitted in conversation that M. Herriot takes a different line andconsiders that he is himself best fitted for the role of leader of post-war france in view of his standing with His Majesty&apos;s Government, the United StatesGovernment and the Soviet Government.A.

ANNEX.Report to the Foreign Office on the Opinion of Political Circles of resistance in France.Part I. Situation of the Political Personnel of the former Republican Regime.Most of the former French political parties have ceased to exist since the signature of the Armistice. Apart from the Communist party, whose organisationcontinues to function secretly, it can be affirmed that the other parties which were represented in the Chamber and Senate have practically disappeared. It is tobe noted, however, that for several months past the Socialist party has been trying to re-form itself, and an effort has been made in this direction by M. Gouin,Deputy for the Bouches-du-Rhone, President of the Socialist ParliamentaryGroup, and M. Philip, Deputy for the Rhone. In a dozen Departments the formerfederations of the Socialistes Francais de lTnternationale Ouvriere (which is thelargest party among French Socialists) are beginning to reorganise themselves.The other parties Radical Party, Republican Federation, Democratic Alliance display no activity.French politicians may therefore at the present moment be divided into twotendencies : the partisans of Franco-German collaboration and those of resistance to the enemy.  In both elements of all the former parties are to be found.(i) Partisans of Collaboration.They are few but very active. The names of their leaders are known fromLaval to trade at, passing through Georges Bonnet, de Monzie, Rene Brunet (Deputyfor the Drome). Chichery, Marquet, Pietri, Xavier Vallat, Philippe Henriot,Spinasse, Paul Faure, Rives, &amp;c. These leaders have only gathered round themabout forty second-class personalities.A certain number of others who can be included in this category have acceptedposts or rewards from the Vichy Government. Among them let us note Prefetslike MM. Potut, Quenette, Parmentier (President of the Legion), M. FrancoisValentin, and the fifty Deputies and Senators who agreed to join the national council appointed by Marshal Petain. Their policy follows the same directionas Vichy&apos;s, and they play the German game in so far as the Marshal also plays it.To sum up, the number of French Parliamentarians compromised in Franco-German collaboration may be estimated at 100 or 150 at the most out of 900.(ii) Partisans of Resistance.The great majority of the French political personnel of the former regimeis therefore profoundly hostile to collaboration with the enemy, but while the partisans of collaboration are loud in their activity, their adversaries are obligedto be much more discreet in order to avoid being arrested or shot.Since the beginning of this year the author of the present report has soundeda large number of Deputies and Senators in unoccupied France, and is in aposition to name the following among the Parliamentarians who have not been arrested and who are most determined to act in the direction of resistance :  Louis Marin, Deputy of Meurthe-et-Moselle, former president of the republican Federation Group, a former Minister, and his friends: CamiileBlaisot, Deputy for the Bas-Rhin; Francois de Wendel, Senator for Meurthe-et-Moselle ; Joseph Denais. Deputy for the Seine; Henri Becquart, Deputy for theNord; Fernand Laurent, vice-president of the Republican Federation Party,Deputy for the Seine (very active); Jacques Bounin, Deputy for the Alpes-Maritimes.Jacquinot, Deputy for the Meuse, a former Minister, and Laniel, a formerMinister, Deputy for Calvados, both personal friends of Paul Reynaud, who have remained very faithful to him.
M. Felix Gouin, president of the Parliamentary Socialist Group and his friends: Philip, Deputy for the Rhône; Froment, Deputy for Ardèche; Grumbach and Malroux, Deputies for the Tarn; Le Trocquet, Deputy for the Seine; Collomp and Zunino, Deputies for the Var; Lussy, Deputy for Vaucluse; Lazurick, Deputy for the Cher; Jules Moch, Deputy for Hérault; Gros, Senator for Vaucluse.

Philippe Serre (Meurthe-et-Moselle).

Vienot (Ardennes) and his friends : Amédée Guy, Deputy for Haute-Savoie, Delom-Sorbé, Deputy for Basses-Pyrénées.

Paul Bastid, former Minister, Deputy for Cantal, and his friends: Montel (Cantal), Léon Martin (Isère), Hussel (Isère), Taurines (Senator for the Loire), Elmiger and Jordery (Deputies for the Rhône), Aimé Berthod (Jura), Léon Bonnevay (Rhône), Marcel Plaisant, Senator for the Cher, Tony Révillon, Senator for the Ain, Astier, Senator for Ardèche; Maurice Rolland, Justin Godard, Bender, Senators for the Rhône. Ramadier, Deputy for Aveyron, a former Minister. Badie and Boulet, Deputies for Hérault. Andraud, Mabrut and Villedieu, Deputies for Puy-de-Dôme; Chassaing, Senator for Puy-de-Dôme.

Champetier de Ribes, Senator for Basses-Pyrénées, a former Minister, president of the Popular Democratic party, together with fellow members of his party, especially MM. Paul Simon, Trémintin, Deputies for Finistère; Ernest Pezet, Desgranges, Deputies for Morbihan.

Also to be noted are François Labrousse, Senator for Corrèze, Questeur to the Senate; Léon Perrier, Senator for Isère; Paul Boncour, formerly President of the Council, Senator for Loir-et-Cher; Monnerville, Deputy for Guyane.

Let us add Deputies who are at present interned or locked up, such as MM. Blum, Mandel, Reynaud, Daladier, Guy La Chambre, Jean Zay, Pierre Bloch, arrested for Gaullism seven months ago, and Max Hymans, who is in hiding from the police after having been concerned with landings in the neighbourhood of Châteauroux.

On the other hand, the author is far from having reached all the Members of Parliament who are scattered in the two Zones. He has only mentioned in the present report those whom he can personally guarantee. Other personalities have been reported to him as being resolute adversaries of collaboration, such as: MM. Jaubert (Corrèze), Geisdoerfer (Côtes-du-Nord), de Moustiers (Doubs), Perrot et Le Bail (Finistère), V. Auriol (Haute-Garonne), Guy Manent (Hautes-Pyrénées), Crutel (Seine-Inférieure), Marc Rucart (Vosges), Reille-Soult (Tarn), Schrameck (Bouches-du-Rhône), A. Honnorat (Basses-Alpes), Hachette (Aisne), Paul Thellier (Somme), Le Gorgeu (Finistère), Jean Odin and E. Roy (Gironde), Pézières (Pyrénées-Orientales), together with the whole political representation (Senators and Deputies) of Alsace and Lorraine.

M. Jeanneney, the President of the Senate, strongly encourages every resistance movement and supports with his high authority all initiative taken by Members of Parliament to manifest their hostility to the Vichy régime and to collaboration.

M. Herriot is also profoundly hostile to collaboration and to the Vichy régime, which deprived him of his post of Mayor of Lyons, to which he was most attached, but his attitude is more reserved, since he fears that displays of resistance by Parliament will lead to the arrest of its best elements, and considers that they are inopportune. M. Herriot is followed in his attitude by M. Julien, a former Minister, who is his faithful lieutenant.

All these persons have been contacted by the writer either directly or indirectly and have authorised him to inform the British Government of their sentiments.

Moreover, the writer has the privilege of having close contacts with M. Georges Mandel and M. Paul Reynaud, who are interned in the Fortress of Pourtalet. All these persons are united round common ideas.

Part II.-The Opinion of the Political Circles of Resistance.

(i) The necessity to bring France back into the war.

It is not possible to consider that the French defeat was decisive; the Battle of France was lost by the inability of the French army to adapt itself to the lightning war, and French patriots wish France to be brought to play its due part in the present conflict.

[23933] B 2
These politicians are, then, convinced that it is necessary for the-french army to take up arms again at the -side of its former Allies and participateeffectively and en masse in the liberation of the territory. They desire, therefore that France should be officially associated with the military operations which will follow the disembarkation which will liberate the country.(ii) Impossibility of Petain bringing France back into the War.The politicians of resistance are absolutely hostile to the idea that marshal petain can perform a second act of treachery and assist in the victory. If theAllies lend themselves to such an operation they would continue to maintain anequivocacy, to increase qualms of conscience which would diminish the fightino-value of the French. They would run the risk of being again betrayed ifunfortunately, the military operations involved no immediate success and if afew small reverses occurred at the outset.On the other hand, whatever attitude Marshal Petain may adopt at themoment when victory is clear, he will never win the support of the French, whohave been suffering for two years under his dictatorship, and have decided, by an immense majority, to overthrow him as soon as the invader has.left the soil ofFrance. It is therefore impossible to conceive that the Allies can count on apuppet Government which is governing without the consent of the people andwhich has betrayed the highest interests of the country.(iii) Necessity for Union behind de Gatdle.General de Gaulle&apos;s popularity in France is considerable. In the forbiddenzone, the whole population, with the exception of 2 or 3 per cent, of traitors, isbehind him. In the occupied zone the number of Frenchmen who await his returnare estimated at approximately 85 orw90 per cent. In the free zone the number is slightly less, on account of the absence of the enemy and the intense propaganda in favour of the Marshal. It is, none the. less, estimated at 70 or 75 per cent.The politicians have perfectly sensed the irresistible character of this popularmovement. Every day Frenchmen accept death or imprisonment for general de Gaulle. It is impossible to find in France the name of any other person for whom Frenchmen would agree to such sacrifices. This is, however, not true of the communists, who also know how to die magnificently for their ideal.The large majority of the Parliamentarians whose names have been given above consider that General de Gaulle must be recognised as the sole leader of theFrench fighting and resisting forces until the French people can, after the victory,freely appoint their representatives.M: Georges Mandel has charged the writer to transmit to the British Govern-ment his personal opinion, which is as follows : He does not know General de Gaulle and is therefore not in a position to appreciate his political qualities, but he considers that his name has a symbolicvalue. General de Gaulle is the only French personality who took up arms againagainst the enemy; he has faced considerable difficulties with magnificent courage:all patriots, whatever their opinions, must range themselves beside him and help him unreservedly in his task. Such is the advice which M. Mandel gives his political friends and which he wished to make known to the British Government.M. Paul Reynaud told the writer that he considered himself, until victoryis achieved, a simple soldier of General de Gaulle. He gave the same advice to his friends.M. Mandel has been painfully surprised by the policy followed by the UnitedStates Government with regard to the Vichy Government.He asked the writer to draw the attention of the British Government to thefact that, in following a policy of appeasement in regard to Marshal Petain, theUnited States Government had maintained confusion in the minds of the peopleof France, an equivocacy from which only the collaborators have derived benefit,since the United States have obtained no advantage from their attitude. In wartime those who fight must be united with simple ideas; by the maintenance of anequivocacy their ideas of their duty are removed.M. Mandel holds the opinion that the Allied Governments should cease tohumour the personality of the Head of the State and the interests of the Free
Zone. He considers that the factories which are working in the Free Zone forthe Germans (notably that at St. diamond, which makes tanks) should be bombedlike those of the occupied zone.What reprisals could the Allies fear in the event of a rupture with Vichy?The French Fleet represents a danger which the British are inclined to exaggerate.In the first place the recruitment^of the sailors and the crews is defective; sincethe armistice they have been recruited in the south or in inland districts. Thebest elements of the crews of the French Fleet were in Normandy, in Brittany andon the Atlantic Coast, which is at present occupied by Germany. None of these could be used in the French Fleet since the armistice. The French sailors atToulon have no experience of the sea and would certainly not behave in a navalbattle as well as those from the Atlantic Coast.Moreover, it is practically impossible for Vichy to launch France into war against the Allies. The Government would meet the almost unanimous resistance of the French people.Doubtless the objection will be raised that French troops fought honourablyagainst the British in Syria and at Madagascar; but these were mercenary troops,often coloured, who had no direct contact with the Vichy Government, and whowere commanded by officers who were set free on parole by the Germans.Moreover the insiduous propaganda of Vichy presented this struggle as onewhich was destined to prevent Great Britain from conquering the French Empire.In the colonial domain the French have a traditional fear of British imperialambitions. The question is not at all the same when the Metropolitan territoryis involved.It does not, therefore, seem possible that Vichy can ever drag France into thewar against the Allies : Laval himself, although he wants to do so, has perfectlyunderstood this. It is for this reason that he has taken pains to repeat in officialcommuniques that he would never take the decision to break off diplomatic relations with the United States. If he has done this, it is only because he fearedthe reaction of the French people against his policy.Besides, it is not a question for the Allies of engaging in provocative acts of war against Vichy, but simply of acting without worrying about Vichyreactions which in no way reflect those of France.For the above reasons, the British Government has every interest indissipating any misunderstanding. It should never lose an occasion ofproclaiming that General de Gaulle is the only recognised leader not only of theforces which are fighting at the side of the A Hies, but of the forces of resistancewhich are awaiting the order of the Allies in order to fight in France.Such a proclamation would be very opportune at the present moment onaccount of the propaganda efforts being made by the Axis and by Vichy in orderto try to convince the French that discord exists between General de Gaulle andthe Allied Governments. It is to be noted that any criticism with regard toGeneral de Gaulle published in the British press or uttered in the british parliament is exaggerated out of all measure in the press and radio by thecollaborators.The traitors of Vichy and Paris show the Allies the road to be followed. Itconsists in practising exactly the contrary policy to theirs : help General de Gaulle,since he is Vichy&apos;s bete noire; abandon Vichy, since Vichy is continually seekingcontacts.The British Government must persuade the United States Government thatthe policy of support for the Free French Forces is both in conformity with thedesire of the French people and with the interests of the coalition. It mustlargely increase the liaison by sea and air between the Free French Forces inLondon and those forces which struggle clandestinely on French territory.Thus will be realised the national rising of France which will effectively help the Allies to win the victory over the common enemy.
