o A m )THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  June 1942.Copy -No.-war CABINET.COLONIAL SERVICE REORGANISATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. THE purpose of this paper is to submit to the Cabinet, for their consideration, certain proposals for the reorganisation of the Colonial Service.ETnder the direction of Lord Moyne, this question has for some time been underconsideration in the Colonial Office, and the proposals represent the conclusions reached after careful study of the problems involved.2. The Colonial Service faces to-day one of the most difficult -certainlyone of the most complex tasks of any body of men in the Empire. Its members are responsible for the administration of some fifty territories in all parts of theworld, inhabited by peoples of many colours, and races, professing every knownreligion, and at widely differing stages of cultural, economic and political develop-ment. The territorial public services which together make up the colonial service are mainly staffed by locally-recruited officials. But they also include,especially in the higher grades, officers recruited from the United Kingdom andthe Dominions. It is in regard to this last category of officers, on whom fallsthe main burden of Colonial administration and the chief responsibility forsecuring the welfare and advancement of the Colonial peoples, that the questionof reorganisation especially applies.3. This relatively small body of higher civil servants, working for the mostpart in climates hostile to the European, is faced with continually changingproblems of the utmost variety and most fundamental character. Events moveand the scene changes at a bewildering pace. It has taken England five hundred years to evolve its present political system and mode of life out of feudalism.Uganda has moved from the 13th to the 20th century within the active life ofLord Lugard.  And this is only one example of an almost universal tendency.4. It is not enough that a Service confronted by such a situation shouldattract as the Colonial Service has done especially over the last dozen years men and women of high personal quality and professional competence. TheService must throughout be kept keyed up to the highest level of efficiency and ready to deal with every new development as it arises. A Colonial Service whichhas to tackle such a situation as now faces it cannot afford to carry, as passengers,senior officers who, though they have clone nothing to deserve dismissal, may well have lost their full efficiency and zest under the enervating conditions of a tropical,climate. Nor can it afford those fluctuations in the demand for Colonial officers,arising from alternate booms and slumps, which have, in the years following1919, made it impossible to maintain a steady recruiting programme or securethe steady application of plans in respect of such matters as scientific research,education and economic development. &apos;5. If it is to function satisfactorily, the Colonial Service must be givensuch a structure and organisation as will, within human limitations, not onlyattract and retain the best material, but ensure&quot; that the right man will always be available in the right place at the right time. This entails a radical alterationof the present arrangements.[23948]^CRET.W.P. (42) 249.June 11, 1942.
6. The last war was followed by an era of political, social and economicevolution in the Colonial Empire, which made novel and exacting demands onthe Colonial Service. To meet them the standard of its recruitment and trainingwere markedly raised, and a new generation of Colonial Civil Servants is no\\-coming to maturity, whose energy and freshness we should do everything possibleto preserve. A turning-point in the history of the Colonial Service was theW arren Fisher Report of 1930 (Cmd. 3554), in which the principle of unification of the Service was advocated. After this war even more rapid developmentsmust be expected, and in circumstances of greater publicity both at home and perhaps in the international sphere. Even now both Parliament and public inthis country are demanding more effective action in the Colonies, especially inrespect of economic development and social welfare.7. The principle of unification of the Service has been only partially applied,and it is now clear that the full benefits of the policy cannot be secured withoutgreater control at the centre. As things are at present, the scope and nature ofthe employment of the officers of the &apos;&apos; unified &quot; Service are conditioned by thefact that they are employees of the particular Colonial Government under which for the time being they are serving. Pay arrangements and other conditions are controlled by the legislature of the Colony, and standardisation is thereforeimpracticable. There are no means by which conditions can be equalised and thestaff which a Colony obtains depends upon the ability or willingness of the locallegislature to provide the salary and other conditions which will attract the rightman. This has the unfortunate but inevitable result that the Colonies Which havethe greatest need of the best men are often the least able to get them. In postingofficers under these conditions the Secretary of State is hampered at every turnby the necessity of considering other factors than the merits and suitability of theindividual for the work which he has to do.8. To meet these difficulties, I submit the outline of a plan of action, the essentials of which are set out in the appendix to this paper. If it is accepted inprinciple, the Colonial Governments will be brought into consultation. Thecentral feature of the plan is that by means of a subvention from the exchequer it makes possible what is at present impossible, Le., an equalisation of remunera-tion and prospects throughout the higher ranks of the Colonial Service, thusdoing away with the present obstacles which prevent the Secretary of State from making the best use of the available man-power.9. The actual salaries, pensions, &amp;c, will have to be worked out, but it willbe essential that they should be sufficiently generous both to attract and retaincandidates of the right quality and to induce existing officers to opt for the new service; otherwise any substantial benefit from the scheme will inevitably be postponed for several years.10. As part of the necessary reorganisation I propose also to develop stillfurther the existing arrangements for interchange between officers of the colonial service and the staff of the Colonial Office. In view of the great disparity of numbers between the Colonial Service abroad and the Colonial Office staff at home,a complete amalgamation similar to that of the Foreign Office and the diplomatic and Consular Services may not be practicable. Nevertheless more interchange isessential and possible. I propose therefore to extend the present practice withoutprejudice to any more comprehensive plan which I may later wish to put forward.11. In this Memorandum I have been thinking particularly of the need for strengthening the grades of the Colonial Service which are for the most partrecruited from outside the Colonies. As a complement to this there is an equalneed for providing fuller opportunities for the Colonial people themselves totake the greatest possible share in the framing and execution of policy in theirown countries. I need not here elaborate the plans in view to secure this objective,but I assure my colleagues that this aspect of the problem is not being neglected.12. I ask my colleagues to approve the plan of action in principle and toauthorise me, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and colonial governors, to work out the details of the plan.June 11, 1942.
APPENDIX.Plan of Action.(i) A new &quot; General List &quot; for the various branches of the Colonial service would be established.(ii) The General List would be made up of (a) officers selected from the existing Colonial services : these officers would be given the opportunity of opting for the new conditions:and(b) officers newly appointed.(iii) All officers on the General List would be under an obligation to accept any post or duty to which they may be assigned by the Secretary of State.(iv) In selecting a candidate for any post in a Colony the Secretary of state would be free to choose in consultation with the Governor either a local candidateor an officer from the General List as he might judge to be in the public interest.(v) Salary scales, leave and pension regulations and other conditions ofemployment for officers on the General List would be determined by the Secretaryof State in accordance with uniform principles, and would not be alterable bythe vote of the Colonial legislatures. There would be basic salary scales supple-mented where necessary by local allowances designed to secure the greatest possibleequality in real wages.(vi) The financial liability of a Colonial Government in respect of any postfor the time being filled by an officer from the General List would be limited tothe amount provided in the estimates of the Colony, as voted by the locallegislature.(vii) Central funds to be administered under the Secretary of State&apos;sdirections would be set up to provide for the salaries, pensions and other expenses in respect of officers on the General List in so far as these are not covered bythe amounts provided in the Colonial Governments&apos; estimates.(viii) An officer on the General List assigned to. a post in a Colony wouldas hitherto be regarded as a member of the Civil Service of the Colony in whichhe is serving and would be subject to the instructions of the Government of theColony in the same way as any other civil servant.(ix) The General List would be divided into suitable grades and promotionsfrom one grade to another would (as hitherto) be made by the Secretary of state on the grounds of experience, qualifications and merit. Promotions would, how-ever, no longer depend upon the fortuitous occurrence of vacancies in specific posts in the Colonies.(x) An essential feature of the plan would be a provision for the compulsoryretirement of officers who have not earned promotion beyond a particular gradeat a particular age.(xi) An Act of Parliament would be required to give the necessary authorityfor the constitution of the General List and the establishment of the central funds. It is estimated that, if the complete plan were in operation, a maximumsubsidy of  600,000 a year would be required from the Exchequer to finance thecentral funds in so far as the Colonial Governments collectively would be unableto meet the full cost of salaries, pensions, passages, &amp;c.
