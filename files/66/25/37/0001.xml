f It.    IVf-r^. )iCO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KE\.II is requested that special oare may be taken ensure th3 secrecy of this document.[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MA.majesty&apos;s GOVERNMENT)secret.P.   (42)  25r&apos;16TH JUNE.  1942eWAR CABINETANNOUNCEMENT OP ARRIVAL OP AMERICAN EOROESReport by the Chiefs of Staff committee we decided a month ago that the publication of astatement concerning the arrival of United States forces inthis country v/oald &quot;be premature, and that only such detailsof the administrative plan for their reception, as was absolutely necessary for efficiency, should be disclosed tothose concerned.2. We have now been led to reconsider this question forthe following reasons:-(a) A considerable amount of Press and radio publicityhas been put out en Loth sides of the Atlanticin the last two weeks, based on the announcement that high-ranking officers of the United states forces were in this country.      It is clear fromthe Press statements and articles that the newsis leaking out,  and cannot be withheld from thepublic much longer.      The issue of a statement,suitably phrased, might have some effect ondiverting Press speculation into safer channelsthan those which are being explored at present.(b) There is a great deal of work to be done on thevery important job of preparing opinion - Pressopinion and local opinion - for the reception of the American forces.      Untold harm may&apos; result if relations between the American soldiers andthe local inhabitants.go awry.      If relations were to be maintained on a friendly basis afterthe first novelty has worn off, the attitudeof the public must be controlled from the start by carefully desigaed publicity.     An early announcement will make it possible for a properly organised campaign to be launched.(c) Some of the work of preparing for the reception and maintenance of the American forces is beinghindered by the strict secrecy at presentenforced about their impending arrival.COPY NO,   - !
3. We do not suggest that there should be any relaxation of the rule that the details of the administrative planare to he disclosed only to those to whom   the knowledge isessential   for efficiency.     In particular, the dates of arrival, the locations and the strengths of United States&apos;formations.must he kept strictly secret.&apos;4* We have consulted General Ghaney ahout removing thesecurity &quot;ban on Press references to the impending arrival of United States forces in this country and he sees noobjection, subject to the conditions given in paragraph above.     We, therefore, recommend that the &quot;ban is now lifted,5,        We do not think it necessary for an authoratitive-statement to be made by a Government spokesman, but werecommend that editors are given careful guidance on the lines to take when this news is released, and on the importance ofdamping down further speculation on the possible opening ofa second front in Europe this year.(S signed) A.P.BROOKE11 DUDLEY POUND&quot; CP.
