(42) 268. %June 26, 1942.WAR CABINET.REPORT BY THE MINISTER OF PRODUCTION ON A VISIT TOTHE UNITED STATES, JUNE 3 TO JUNE 19, 1942.I append, for the information of my colleagues, a short report on myrecent visit to the United States.Objects of visit.Apart from the general desirability of my meeting Mr. Hopkins, Mr. Nelsonand others concerned with United States war production, there were two main reasons for my visit :-First, it was becoming increasingly evident that a closer integration ofthe British and American production programmes was necessary. It was clear to me that the American Army authorities were tending to exercise an ever-increasing control over United States production. It was reported tome that they were setting the production sights at levels which bore littlerelation to possibilities, and it appeared probable that the Americanprogrammes would be approved without any reference to British requirementsof materials, components, &amp;c.Secondly, I wanted, to satisfy myself by personal observation that ourown organisation in the United States was on the right lines. this organisation had, of course, been built up some time before the United states were in the war, and when we were in the position of customers rather thanallies.Part I-Combined Production and Resources Board.1. When I reached Washington, on the 3rd June, I found that the UnitedStates Army authorities were proposing to take over the whole production of theUnited States. There was, of course, no chance of such a scheme ultimatelyworking, but had it been put into operation great harm would have been done before it broke down.2. The programmes of the three Services were said to involve a total sum(although I am unable to confirm the figure) of 224 billion dollars. Reduced toan annual figure, there seems to be little doubt that the appropriations, if granted by Congress, would have at least equalled and probably exceeded the total national income of the United States for that year. Again, the programme would have broken down, but in the course of breaking down a disastrous effect might havebeen produced on the national economy.3. In these vast programmes, no part, except for certain finished munitions, was assigned to Great Britain, and there was a grave danger of our whole production programme being smothered. Further, the American pro-gramme of production was being based, on a notional establishment of forces,which was in no way related to immediate strategic needs or immediate productionpossibilities.
4. I may at this point that the attitude of mind of the United states military authorities made it immediately clear&apos; to me that any attempt to getspecial allocations of special materials, and to deal with our production problemspiece-meal by personal negotiations would henceforward be certain to fail.5. My first step was to see Mr. Donald Nelson and the War ProductionBoard, and I received from them the greatest possible co-operation. They agreedthat the programmes of the two countries must be integrated, and they welcomedour proposal to set up the Combined Production and Resources Board. I thinkit is fair to say that their attitude was partly inspired by a wish to solve theirown problems as well as ours, and I made full use of this.6. I then saw the President and we agreed on the terms of a directivesetting up the Combined Production and Resources Board. This directive wasmade public on the 10th June (Annex I).7. I then approached General Marshall and iidmiral King. To the formerI pointed out that production must be related not to a notional establishmentbut to an operation of war, and cited as an instance the Bolero plan. If materials and effort were devoted to the building of a vast future programme, the impact of our forces upon the enemy would be delayed. And to Admiral King I pointedout the same thing in relation to the naval programme, escort vessels and merchantshipping. I got them both to agree that production must be related to an operation of war, and that the production authorities must be given an estimateof forces to be deployed in the defensive and offensive theatres of war by the1st April, 1943.8. I then urged that the British contribution to the war by that date shouldbe agreed, and that when it was agreed Great Britain should enjoy the samepriorities for components and finished munitions as were enjoyed by american forces of equal strategical importance.9. The agreement which I sought, however, goes much further than wouldappear at first sight. If the British contribution is agreed, then the necessaryraw materials to complete our production programme, the necessary shipping and so forth, must also be allotted. I cite the instance of steel. The consumptionof steel in this country required to implement our programme is about 17 million ingot tons per annum, involving the use of say 5 million tons of ingot steel fromthe United States. If the forces which Great Britain is to deploy by the1st April, 1943, are agreed, and if to equip them involves 17 million tons of steel,then we have, over the 5 million tons of United States produced steel, exactly thesame rights as the War Department or Navy Department in the United States.Under the old system our Raw Materials Mission would have had to engage in aseries of special pleadings, which to-day would certainly fail because of the strain on the raw materials supply of the United States. Under the new system theywould have a master document which would enable them to put their case on sound lines. If, for example, as might well happen, there turned out to be a2 per cent, or 3 per cent, deficiency (equalling say 2 million tons) in the total steelavailable, we should only be scaled down by 340,000 tons, whereas under theprevious arrangements the whole of the (say) 2 million tons or 2 per cent,deficiency might have been deducted from our quota.10; The first meeting of the Combined Production and Resources Boardtook place on the 17th June. At this meeting the resolutions embodied in annex II to this Report were agreed to.  They may be summarised as follows : (A) Asking the Combined Chiefs of Staff to provide an analysed statementof combined requirements to be produced by end of 1942 and end 1943.(B) Agreeing in principle that British requirements of components and non-common type items should have priority ratings equivalent tothose given to United States weapons of equal strategic importance.(C) Asking the Combined Raw Materials Board to report immediately on1942 and 1943 deficiencies of critical materials.(D) Agreeing to institute an immediate survey of rubber requirements formilitary purposes. Combined Raw Materials Board to report onrubber supply in 1942 and 1943.
(E) Proposing an immediate review of combined gun ammunition and small arms ammunition programmes and requirements by the combined chiefs of Staff and Combined Production and Resources Boardbecause of copper shortage.(F) Proposing an enquiry by the Combined Chiefs of Staff, the combined production and Resources Board and the Combined Shipping andAdjustment Board to resolve competition for materials and facilitiesbetween escort vessels, other naval shipbuilding, landing craft,merchant ships, tanks and other production requiring the samematerials.(G) Asking the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board to submit a survey ofshipping available for strategic production and import plans for 1943.(H) Inviting the production authorities to plan their programmes so that supplies are, wherever possible, shipped direct from America to overseas theatres of war, except where Great Britain is the naturalservicing base.11. These resolutions were forwarded to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, andon the 18th June Mr. Nelson and I attended a meeting at which the resolutions were considered by the Combined Chiefs of Staff. All the officers presentsignified that in general they accepted the resolutions without reservation,although they did not accept List A attached to the resolutions until they had had time for discussion.Part II. British Organisation in the United States.12. I turn to our own organisation. I am opposed to sending anybody ofCabinet rank to Washington on the civilian side. Such a Minister would enjoymuch influence and would get a hearing in the first weeks he was there, but hewould afterwards become absorbed in the Missions and would become a fifthwheel of the coach. The Administration have come to look to Sir Clive Baillieuon Raw Materials, to Sir Arthur Salter on Shipping, to Mr. R. H. Brand on food, and so forth, and no Minister could expect to argue all the cases involvedas well as the Head of each Mission can do himself. Moreover, there should notbe the same need for access to the President and Mr. Hopkins when the generalpart which Great Britain is to play has been previously determined. Nevertheless,very close liaison with the President and the Government of the United Statesand with the War Production Board is necessary, and I would propose, with mycolleagues&apos; consent, to follow the general principle of going myself to America(for a much shorter, visit) three times per annum. I have arranged withMr. Donald Nelson that he will come here once or twice a year, if it should benecessary, to discuss production.13. As a result of the setting up of the Combined Production and resources board it has been necessary for me to appoint a deputy, who will act on my behalf,and who will have his offices in the War Production Board building. This deputyshould not, I suggest, be a Minister.14. I propose that my deputy in the United States should at the same time be appointed Chairman of the British Supply Council. The British supply council is the British body in Washington which is responsible, in agreementwith, the Ambassador, for co-ordinating all issues of policy concerning Supplymatters, and in making all representations to the Administration. All the Headsof the British Civil Missions and British representatives on the Combined boards in Washington are members of the Supply Council. I feel that to some extent the Council has been hampered in the past by lack of information from london on matters of general policy, and I think that this has been because the north american Supply Committee in London has not been functioning as a live and effective body; and I therefore propose that the North American supply committee should in future meet at regular intervals, that its Secretariat shouldbe expanded, and that it should act as the channel for communication with theSupply Council in Washington on matters of general policy.15. The British Purchasing Commission, the name of which is to be changed(with the consent of the Minister of Supply) to the Ministry of Supply Mission,does not at the present moment enjoy satisfactory relations with the British
Military authorities in Washington. I say this without apportioning the blame,but I shall be proposing certain changes in the organisation&apos; and personnel to remedy this defect.16. There are two Missions relating to the air, the R.A.F. Delegation underAir Marshal Evill, representing the Air Ministry, and the British Air Commis-sion under Sir Richard Fairey, representing the Ministry of Aircraft Production.In the changed circumstances since the United States entered the war, I do notthink the line of demarcation between these two bodies is now entirely logical,and I propose to take this question up with the Secretary of State for Air and theMinister of Aircraft Production.17. Subject to what I have said above, I consider that all the BritishMissions in Washington have been doing valuable work.Part III. General.18. I visited Ottawa and had a conference with Colonel Howe, the canadian minister of Munitions. I also had a talk with the Prime Minister of Canada.Canadian production in many instances is remarkable.19. While in Washington I saw the President several times andMr. Hopkins almost every day, and a number of other members of theAdministration, including the Secretary of State, the Secretary of theTreasury, the Secretaries of the War Department and of the Navy Department,Mr. Wickard, General Arnold, Mr. Lewis Douglas, Mr. Lovett, Mr. Forestal,Colonel Donovan, Mr. Jesse Jones, Mr. Bullett, Mr. McCloy, Mr. Patterson andothers.20. The Combined Boards which were set up in the early part of the year,that is to say, the Combined Raw Materials Board, the Combined Shipping andAdjustment Board and the Combined Munitions Assignment Board, have worked well. The recently formed Combined Food Board will, I feel, perform an essentialservice.0. L.June 26, 1942.
ANNEX I.Text of Joint Statement made by the President and the Prime minister on June 9, 1942, constituting a Combined Production and resources board.In order to complete the organisation needed for the most effective use of the combined resources of the United States and United Kingdom for the prosecution of the war, there is hereby established a Combined Production and resources board.The Board shall consist of the Chairman of the War Production Board,representing the United States, and the Minister of Production, representing theUnited Kingdom.The Board shall: (a) Combine the production programmes of the United States and the UnitedKingdom into a single integrated programme, adjusted to the strategic requirements of the War, as indicated to the Board by the combined chiefs of Staff, and to all relevant production factors. In this con-nection, the Board shall take account of the need for maximumutilisation of the productive resources available to the United States,the British Commonwealth of Nations, and the United Nations, theneed to reduce demands on shipping to a minimum, and the essential needs of the civilian populations.(&amp;) In close collaboration with the Combined Chiefs of Staff, assure the con-tinuous adjustment of the combined production programme to meetchanging military requirements.To this end, the Combined Chiefs of Staff and the Combined MunitionsAssignments Board shall keep the Combined Production and Resources Boardcurrently informed concerning military requirements, and the combined Produc-tion and Resources Board shall keep the Combined Chiefs of Staff and the combined Munitions Assignments Board currently informed concerning the facts and possibilities of production.To facilitate continuous operation, the members of the Board shall eachappoint a deputy, and the Board shall form a combined staff. The Board shallarrange for such conferences among United States and United Kingdom personnelas it may from time to time deem necessary or appropriate to study particularproduction needs, and utilise the Joint War Production Staff in London, the combined Raw Materials Board, the Joint Aircraft Committee, and other existingcombined or national agencies for war production in such manner and to such extent as it shall deem necessary.
ANNEX II.Meeting of Combined Production and Resources Board.1. THE resolutions set forth below are based on the following assumptions :  The governing principle of production policy is to equip such strikingforces as the Combined Chiefs of Staff desire, to be employed against theenemy at dates determined by the Combined Chiefs of Staff.The strength of the force that can be in the battle line on the1st April, 1943, depends in the main on the combined production throughDecember of this year. Broadly, the general pattern of production inUnited States and Great Britain is already determined. However, usefuladjustments may be made if decisions on the points mentioned below are taken before the end of the month. These immediate decisions must complete the planning for 1942.The output of 1943 is being determined by allocations of material thatare being made from now onward. If this production is to be adjusted tostrategical needs throughout 1943 service requirements and their appropriatepriorities on a combined basis must be determined now.The effective striking power of the United Nations in 1943 will be controlled both in its sum and in its distribution by shipping.2. The Combined Production and Resources Board resolve as follows : A. Requirements.In order that the production of 1942 may be tested against the strategicalneeds of Spring 1943, and that appropriate allocation and production plans maybe put into effect for 1943, the Combined Chiefs of Staff are invited to direct the appropriate service authorities (a) to prepare and furnish to the Board a statement of arms and munitionsrequired to be produced by the 31st December, 1942, with suchanalysis as is possible, relating such combined requirements to the operational needs of the forces designed to give effect, in the severaltheatres of war, to the decision of the President and the PrimeMinister that there should be maximum impact upon the enemy in the spring of 1943,(b) to prepare a similar statement as at the end of 1943.B. Priority Ratings.Since certain components, items of non-common type, spares and associatedequipment from the United States are essential to the completion of the Britishmunitions programmes, it is agreed that priority ratings should be allotted tothose items of equipment equivalent to the United States weapons for forces of equivalent strategical importance.In accordance with this statement of principle and as an immediate step, itis proposed that highest ratings should be given forthwith to components anditems of non-common type as shown in List A attached, which represents only alimited portion of the total British demands upon the United States, and includesonly those items and components $which are vitally essential to the continuity ofBritish production, consistent with a maximum combined battle strength on^ the1st April, 1943. The classification of other British components and finished items of non-common type should be considered forthwith by committees which would include representatives of the Combined Chiefs of Staff and representatives ofthe Combined Production and Resources Board. The Chairman of the war production Board will administer the priorities and allocations system inaccordance with the foregoing.C. Raw Material.In order to make the maximum use of the combined production and resourcesit is agreed in principle that the raw materials needed by United States, Britain,
Russia and other United Nations in 1942 shall be supplied from the commonpool. The Combined Raw Materials Board shall, as a matter of urgency, report upon any deficiency of critical materials which may be in prospect in 1942, andin 1943.D. Rubber.In view of the acute rubber shortage, a review shall immediately be under-taken by the War Production Board and the Minister of Production respectivelyof the requirements of major rubber consuming items of war equipment for theUnited States and Great Britain. The report will set out the basis on whichthese requirements are based,&apos; including maintenance rates, specifications, &amp;c.This review, which should be completed within two weeks, shall be made simultaneously in London and Washington.The Combined Raw Materials Board shall simultaneously report on theassured and potential supply of rubber to the end of 1943.On receipt of the report, the Combined Production and Resources Board will then give such directions as may be appropriate, taking account of the require-ments of the United States, Britain, and others of the United Nations.E. Copper.In view of the serious shortage of copper a review shall immediately beundertaken in Washington by the Combined Chiefs of Staff and the combined production and Resources Board of the United States and United Kingdom&apos;sgun ammunition and S.A.A. programmes and requirements.F. Ship Construction, Programmes.In view of the competition for materials and facilities between escort vessels,other naval shipbuilding, landing craft and merchant ships, tanks and otherproduction requiring such materials, the Combined Chiefs of Staff are invited toconsider, in the light of strategic requirements, the choices among possible adjust-ments of the American and British programmes for such production, in conjunc-tion with the Combined Production and Resources Board and the CombinedShipping Adjustment Board.G. Shipping.The Combined Shipping Adjustment Board is invited to submit a survey ofthe probable shipping available to carry out the strategic production and importplans for 1943.H. Production Programmes and Economy of Shipping.The Combined Production and Resources Board endorses the statement ofpolicy contained in the letter of the 10th June from the Combined ShippingAdjustment Board. In order to economise shipping it invites the authorities concerned to plan their programme in such a way that wherever possible supplies are produced and shipped direct from the American Continent to all theatres ofwar, except those for which Great Britain is the natural servicing base.3. In order to provide for the continuous study of the programmes and fortheir integration the Board should (a) determine the character of its staff and secretariat, and(b) invite the Combined Chiefs of Staff to arrange appropriate machineryfor continuous collaboration.Washington, June 17, 1942.

Combined Production and Resources Board,c/o War Production Board.&apos;   Washington, D.C.Gentlemen, June 10, 1942.In welcoming the creation of the Combined Production and Resources Board,we are writing, as the Combined Shipping Adjustment Board, to invite yourattention to a question of production policy which is of importance from thepoint of view of the use of merchant shipping.Military equipment (aeroplanes, tanks, guns and trucks) is being shipped from the United States or Canada to the United Kingdom, and from the UnitedKingdom to other theatres of war, for example the Middle East.We wish to emphasize that wherever it is possible to supply and ship direct from the American continent for any theatre of war, except one for which theUnited Kingdom is the natural servicing base (i.e., the United Kingdom itselfor Western Europe), an important economy in shipping is secured. For example,to ship from the United Kingdom to the Middle East a tank which is thenreplaced either by another tank from the United States to the United kingdom or by a tank made in the United Kingdom from steel imported from the UnitedStates, involves, in effect, double handling, a longer total voyage, and greaterrisk.Ideally, from the shipping point of view, it would be desirable that what isrequired for use in the United Kingdom or a theatre for which the UnitedKingdom is the natural servicing base should be made in the United Kingdom,and what is required for use in other theatres of war should be supplied andshipped from the United States and Canada.We realize the practical difficulties in giving full effect to such a principle,since to do so would involve a considerable change in production and, in somecases, the use by soldiers in the field of equipment of types to which they havenot been trained. We realize also that to a considerable extent arrangements have been changed in the way we desire, most of the trucks required, for example,in the Middle East being now supplied from this continent.Nevertheless, we think it well, in view of the increased strain on shipping,to ask that every possible effort should be made to carry the process further.A somewhat similar point arises in the case of aeroplanes where the theatre of war for which they are required is the United Kingdom. It is clear thatto the extent to which fighters, or the types of bombers which cannot fly the ocean,are made in the United Kingdom, while ocean-flying bombers required for usethere are made in the United States, the task of merchant shipping is relieved.Any immediate economies can obviously&apos; only be made by changes in theallocation of equipment already made or in the course of production. We are,therefore, writing on similar lines to the Munitions Assignments Board. To givethe utmost practicable extension to the principle, however, over a longer period will doubtless require some adjustment in the respective production programmes of the United States and the United Kingdom, and it is for this reason that weare now writing to you.We should be glad to co-operate with you in any way that you may findconvenient in the consideration of any plans designed to relieve the strain uponshipping or the task of transporting military equipment.Yours sincerely,(Signed) E. S. LAND.ARTHUR SALTER.
