The following directive is being issued to Government Departments:&quot;The War Cabinet were recently informed that complaints had been  received from a number of Welsh Members of Parliament that adequate attention was not paid to giving representation oncommittees, advisory councils and similar bodies,  to Welsh menand women.      In some cases the special interests of Wales requirethe setting up of a special committee or organisation for thispart of the United Kingdom.      Where this is not necessary,Departments concerned in setting up committees or advisory bodiesshould in all cases give special consideration to the inclusionof Wales with a bias in favour of such inclusion unless the considerations of administrative convenience are strongly against this course.      In arms, where Welsh units exist, every effort should be made to post persons from Wales, especially when theyare unilingual,  to&quot;Wels&apos;h units.      Unless security grounds render it undesirable, they should be allowed to send and receive lettersin the Welsh language. &quot;The War -Cabinet directed that this reminder should be broughtl2 the notice of officers responsible for arranging the personnel0&quot; committees,  advisory councils and similar bodies.
