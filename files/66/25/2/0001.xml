THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1942.SECRET. / copy No.W.P. (42) 222. /       \/May 25, 1942.WAR CABINET.ITALIANS IN ETHIOPIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the restoration of Ethiopian independence it was decided that for security reasons all Italians should be evacuated from Ethiopia; males ofmilitary age to go to British territories in East Africa for internment, andwomen, children and men over military age or otherwise unfit for militaryservice to be repatriated on vessels which the Italian Government would furnish.2. The Emperor himself on several occasions urged us to ensure the departure from his country of these Italians, and their evacuation is well on theway; but, more recently, he has appealed to me urgently to allow some 2,800Italian technicians and their families, making a total of about 4,000, to remainin order to keep Italian-created utility services, industries and transport working on something like the standard introduced into the country by the Italianadministration. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Addis Ababa supported the Emperoron the ground that by this means Ethiopia would be able to make an outstandingcontribution to the Allied war effort. I felt considerable doubt about the extentof this contribution and whether its value would justify running the securitydanger entailed by the presence in Ethiopia, through which in certain contingen-cies our communications might lie, of so many Italians. Essential information regarding the productive capacity for the war effort of Ethiopia not being available in London but being available to the M.E.S.C. in Cairo, I put the issuebefore the Minister of State in the Middle East and asked him for his views.3. The Minister of State, after full examination of all the factors, hassupported the contention of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, EastAfrica, that in the interests of security not more than 500 Italians, with areasonable number of dependents, should be retained in Ethiopia. The Ministerof State also considers that Ethiopia&apos;s contribution would in. any case be only small in relation to the scale of Middle East requirements, and that, withoutretaining more Italians, a substantial part of that contribution could be realised.In addition, the Minister of State is arranging that the U.K.C.C. shall take overItalian transport concerns and operate a limited transport service in which itwould be possible, without danger to security, to employ Italian drivers inaddition to the 500 Italians to be retained otherwise in Ethiopia. To this GeneralPlatt has agreed.4. In view of the Minister of State&apos;s report, in which I concur, I have informed the Emperor that I am unable to intervene in support of His Majesty&apos;request that more than 500 Italians should be kept back from evacuation. I havealso stressed in a personal message to the Emperor the dangers of intrigue and sabotage which the retention of ever 500 Italians will present to his country, andI have urged that the Ethiopian Government should spare no effort to replaceall these Italians by Ethiopians or persons of Allied nationality at the earliestpossible moment.A.
