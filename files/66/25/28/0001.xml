RAIDS ON COLOGNE AND ESSEN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a summary of a telegram sent bythe United States Charge d&apos;Affaires at Vichy to the State Department atWashington on the 3rd June, 1942, in which Mr. Tuck gives an estimate ofthe effects in France of the recent R.A.F. raids on Cologne and Essen.A. E.Foreign Office, June 10, 1942.SECRET. Copy No.     29W.P. (42) 248.June 10, 1942.Substance of a telegram sent by the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires at Vichyto Washington on June 3, 1942.MASS raids recently carried out on Cologne and Essen by over one thousandBritish bombers and the apparently successful defence which British forces are putting up against Rommel&apos;s latest offensive have combined to give a great boostto British prestige which several months ago was at a rather low ebb followingRommel&apos;s successful counter-offensive in Libya, the fall of Singapore, and theChannel dash of the German battleships.The fact that the R.A.F. has carried out these two crushing blows on Germancities and that the British Imperial and Free French forces are so far successful in coping with Rommel&apos;s &quot;heretofore invincible army&quot; have acted as a tonicon the French people, the great majority of whom, while earnestly hoping for an anglo-Saxon victory, had lost confidence to a great extent in British militarycapacity. From all sides the comment is heard that at last the German people are beginning to knew what war means, and the French public is urgently hoping that these two mass raids are only the beginning of an air offensive which will see weekly air raids on a similar scale continued on German cities. In this connexion we also hear that such raids will act as an antidote to the VichyGovernments present campaign to persuade French workers to go to Germany.The air superiority which the British apparently have in Western Europehas produced a wave of optimism in France from which springs the hope that theday may not be so far off when successful military intervention can be effected onthe Continent. There is no doubt whatsoever that the vast majority of the peopleof France are counting on a successful landing on the Continent of Europe thisyear.11754   [23940]
