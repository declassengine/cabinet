It is general auchinleck&apos;s responsibility to ensure that this does nothappen but his plans are continuously hampered by the^fallureto obtain Russian co-operation,.    The attached extract froma Personal Telegram to the Chief of the Imperial General Staffgives General Auchinleck&apos;s views on this question.20 All our efforts to convince the Russians of theimportance of close collaboration have so far failed, as shown below:-(a) In October, 1941? General Wavell, commander-in-Chief,India, had conversations in Tiflis with GeneralKoslov, the Russian Commander in the Caucasus,and in general terms made offers of assistanceto ensure the security of the Southern russian front.    General Koslov had apparently no authorityto negotiate but promised that further staff talksshould take place.(b) Lieut6 General Hutton, C.G.S., India, whowasappointed to pursue these talks, was met bycontinuous procrastinations, and at the beginningof November, returned to India without having had any discussions at a11*(c)We maintained some sort of contact withby means of exchange missions at Tiflisvalue wasthe russians and Bagdad.but little information ofthe Russians suggested their withdrawal in January,1942, we had not sufficiently powerful reasons to object, and on the 5&quot;th February our mission at Tifliswas ordered to return to Middle Eastc(d) Meanwhile Russian successes in holding up the german offensive on Rostov and our own weakness in middle east as a result of the entry of Japan into the warmade it more difficult than ever to open the questionagain.    The Russians were full of confidence and wehad nothing to offer.      * AnneXo

( e) Nevertheless the Oornmand.er-iri-Gh.ief was unable to proceedwith the full preparation of his defensive plan forPersia without the co-operation of the Russians and in  .May the three Cornmanclers-in-Chief again referred thequestion to the Chiefs of Staff.    The Foreign Officedecided that- as we had nothing to offer the Russians,it would he most dangerous to make any sort of approach.Uc      In addition to the failure of these direct approachesthe Russians have gratuitously placed impediments in the wayof co-operation:-(a)  They have demanded that Russian control of the Trans-Persian railway should &quot;begin at Qum in spite of thefact that, in our opinion, the efficient working of therailway, which is mainly used for sending them supplies,requires our keeping control up to Teheran,,      Thisprohlem is still outstanding though for the present we retain our control up to Teheran.(d)  The Russians are now insisting on their exclusive use ofQali-Morghi aerodrome near Teheran,  in spite of that factthat it is an essential link in the London - Kuibyshevair service and the only aerodrome in Teheran suitablefor use &quot;by the R0A,1\  all the year round,(c)  Russian vacillation over the evacuation of Poles fromUzbekistan,,  ending in a practically unadvertised exodus,threw an enormous strain upon our administration.     The un-certainty sxirrounding future evacuations increases . thedifficulties of administrative and strategic planning in theMiddle East,5.    We consider that in spite of all these failures anddisappointments, the vital issues at stake demand that we make further efforts to secure either high level staff talkscovering all prohlems in the Caucasus area and the Middle east command, or at least the following particular facilities.(a) Permission to reconnoitre all roads and tracks up tothe line of the River Araxes including all crossingsover the river.(b) Permission to reconnoitre the railway up to and including Mianeh and to develop railheads where necessary.(c) Permission to reconnoitre and prepare aerodromes andmaintenance facilities in North Persia particularly inthe Tahriz - Pahlevi - Ardebil - Kasvin areas.(d) Permission to construct defences as required afterreconnaissance,(e) Agreement to our taking over buildings and installationsas necessary for maintenance purposes,,(f) Information as to what facilities exist for the operationof light naval forces in the Caspian &quot;Sea,(g) Permission to undertake map surveys in Russian occupiedPersia,

6. The Foreign Office have hitherto felt unable to makea direct approach to the Soviet Government on the grounds that  /e have little or nothing to offer the Russians in the wayof armed support in the Levant-Caucasus, on a sufficiently large scale to impress them.7* The improved atmosphere created &quot;by the signing ofthe Treaty and by M. Molotov^ visit., offers a favourable opportunity to make a &quot;bold find frunic approach to the russians and wo recommend that this should be done through whateverchannel the War Cabinet 3hould decide.(Signed) A.P. BROOKEDUDLEY POUNDC. PORTALGreat George Street, S.W.1,13TH JUNE,  1942 oANNEX.Extract from Middle East Telegram No. CS/1206dated bth June, lW2aPersonal and Most Secret for C.I.G.S, fromGeneral Auchinleck,* * % * *3.     We can not with the meagre resources left to us hope to stop the enemy in Northern Persia unless I can have fullfacilities for recce,  and preparation over whole area (Mianeh)Zinjan Kazvin Tehran Haraadan Senna.    Unless we get these facilities I can not accept responsibility for securing BasraAbadan and Persian oilfields against enemy attack as if v/e cannot deny Northern Persia to enemy his penetration to head of persian Gulf is merely matter of time.U.     We can not have it both ways and I suggest that fullurgency of this must be impressed at once on Govt.  and particularly on Foreign Office,5*      If these facilities can not be obtained within the next fewweeks at very latest before end of June I must ask you for animmediate redefinition of, my task in respect of Persia.6,     Troops are already moving forward in our own sphere in persia and preparations there are in full swing.      It isessential that similar measures be taken north of Teheran in very near future.    There is no alternative to this.7.     Russians being realistic must know that there ispossibility of theix1 being thrown out of Caucasus,      If this shouldhappen and provided we can hold Northern Persia there is surelystill chance of supplying them with munitions across Caspianto Astrakhan or other ports.      Can not (repeat not) this beput baldly and firmly to them.8.     Our general position in Asia is precarious enough alreadyand we can not (repeat not)  afford to take any further risks.* * * %
