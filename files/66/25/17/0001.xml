Combined Operations.1. In the early hours of the 4th a small raid on the coast of France in theBoulogne-Le Touquet area was carried out. A force consisting of 250 special service troops took part, the intention being to destroy an R.D.F. station at st.. Cecile.   This object was not achieved.The force was landed from light naval craft and was faced by considerable opposition. The enemy brought machine-gun fire and mortars to bear on the approaches from the beach and on the landing craft lying off shore. Our force was able to remain on shore for about forty-five minutes, when it was decidedto withdraw under the cover of a smoke screen.Our light naval forces attacked two enemy patrol boats which attempted to intervene, one of these was sunk and the other damaged.Three bombers attacked the area and five squadrons of Spitfires and one squadron of Hurricanes gave support and cover to the re-embarkation and with-drawal of the troops. One fighter is missing. Enemy aircraft attacked the returning force with machine-guns, causing several casualties to naval personnel and damaging one of the craft.Reports at present available state that there were the following casualties : Naval: 2 killed, IS wounded.   Military: 1 killed, 2 missing.naval SITUATION,General Review.2. A convoy from the United Kingdom has reached Russia with theloss of seven ships out of a total of 34.Shipping casualties reported have been less heavy than of late.Home Waters.3. H.M.S. Howe, a new battleship of the &quot;King.George V&quot; class,commissioned in the Clyde on the 1st.An enemy aircraft was destroyed off the Humber on the night of 29th/30thMay by H.M. Trawler Cayrian.During the week some 40,000 tons of enemy merchant shipping are estimated to have been sunk or seriously damaged by our aircraft.Northern Waters.4. The greater part of the outward convoy, attacks on which were reported last week, arrived safely in North Russia. It is now known that, in all, sevenships, totalling 43,200 tons, were sunk, six of them by aircraft and the seventhby U-boat. At least three enemy aircraft were destroyed and several othersprobably destroyed or damaged. Four other aircraft are reported to have been shot down by an escorting Russian destroyer.No damage or casualties were caused in the homeward convoy from Russia.Mediterranean.5. H.M. Submarine Thrasher torpedoed and sank a laden southbound ship of 3,500 tons in the Adriatic on the 19th May.Aircraft reinforcements for Malta were flown off on the 3rd from one ofH.M. Aircraft-carriers.Two E-boats were engaged north-west of Tobruk and driven off by a motor-launch and two smaller craft on the night of 28th/29th May.During the week 17,700 tons of French merchant shipping eastbound have passed through the Straits of Gibraltar under escort.Pacific.6. An attack was made on Sydney Harbour on 31st May by four Japanesemidget U-boats, all of which were destroyed. H.M.A.S. Kuttabui, Depot ship,a converted ferry-steamer, was torpedoed and sunk. Her casualties were twokilled, 10 wounded and 13 missing.
It is reported from Melbourne that one of our submarines has sunk an armedtransport of 6,000 tons and two laden supply ships of 6,000 and 10,000 tons inaddition to damaging a third supply ship of 7,000 tons.Two air attacks on Dutch Harbour in the Aleutian Islands were made bythe Japanese on the 3rd.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. H.M. Destroyers Fridge, Hero and Hurworth sank a German U-boat100 miles north-east of Tobruk on the 28th May and picked up forty-two survivors.Twenty-nine other attacks, nine by surface craft and 20 by aircraft, have beenreported during the week. Three of the attacks were carried out in North Russianwaters, six south of Iceland and in the North-Western Approaches, four in the bay of Biscay area and five in the Mediterranean. There were eleven attacks inthe Western Atlantic, nine of which were made by United States ships and aircraft. Two of the attacks made by aircraft in the eastern and western mediterranean were promising.Enemy Intelligence.8. It appears from air photographs of Gydnia that the battle-cruiserGneisenau has had two. possibly three, turrets removed while under repair. the battle-cruiser Scharnhorst may be ready to start trials shortly.The invasion craft which have been reported in southern Norway have not yetproceeded north of Trondheim.U-Boats.9. There have been no marked changes in U-boat dispositions during theweek. Activity continues to be chiefly in the Caribbean and, to a lesser extent,in the Gulf of Mexico and off the north-eastern coast of the United States. a movement is apparent into the trade routes to the east and north-east of Braziland both German and Italian U-boats are now operating in this area. Thereare signs of patrols being maintained between Bermuda and New York and between Bermuda and Halifax.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending the 3rd June 1,049 ships, including 343 allied and 15 neutral have been convoyed. One cruiser, one armed merchant cruiser and one ocean boarding vessel, four anti-aircraft ships, two submarines, 62destroyers (including two United States destroyers) and 89 sloops, cutters and corvettes, were employed on escort duties.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending the 30th May totalled 537,000 tons, compared with 652,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average also of 652.000 tons for the past ten weeks.Of the week&apos;s imports, 112,000 tons were oil of various grades.Enemy Attack on Trade.11. During the period sixteen ships are reported to have been attacked by -boat and, of these, five are known to have sunk. Thirteen of the attacks tookplace in the West Atlantic and the remaining three off south-eastern Australia.In the West Atlantic five occurred in the Caribbean area, two off the Nova Scotiancoast, five in ocean waters some hundreds of miles from the North American coast and one to the south of Pernambuco.One ship which had previously been damaged was sunk at anchor offMurmansk by aircraft.British Minelaying.12. Surface craft have laid mines during the week in the Denmark Strait.Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out in the Baltic, off the German north sea Coast, and in the Bay of Biscay.[23904] b 2
Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.13. There has been a considerable increase in minelaying by enemy aircraft,especially in the Humber area and the Thames Estuary. Some mines were alsolaid by E-boats off the Norfolk coast. Twenty-five mines have been destroyeddurino- the week, including nine magnetic mines in the East Coast War Channel.The mine totals are 2,101 &quot;magnetic, 1,279 acoustic and 1,278 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.14. It is reported that the German Osorno (6,951 tons), which was lastlocated at Yokohama, and two other ships from the Far East, arrived at Bordeauxm The Italian tankers Albaro (2,104 tons) and Celeno (3,741 tons) sailed fromIstanbul for Constanza on the 27th May.United States Intelligence.15. The main fleet concentration is still in the Central Pacific and only twoheavy cruisers are at present in Australian waters.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.Ukraine.16. On the 30th May Germans announced that the Donets battle had endedwith the encirclement and destruction of three Russian armies south of Kharkov,and claimed the capture of 240,000 prisoners and a vast quantity of material.This was categorically denied by the Russians, who put their own losses at75,000, but claimed that the Germans had lost 95,000 kilied or taken prisoner.The accuracy^ of these figures remains unchecked. The enormous German claims were probably dictated by propaganda considerations. At the same time it isprobable that the German drive towards Isyum succeeded in destroying a portionof the Russian forces and in forcing the remainder to withdraw eastwards, withthe result that the former salient south of Karkov has now largely been eliminated.Pockets of Russians may, however, still be resisting at various points betweenKrasnograd and Isyum.17. Teh conclusion of the battle south of Kharkov has brought a temporarylull in major operations along the Eastern Front, although local fighting continuesunabated in a number of sectors. A German full-scale offensive in the SouthernSector has not yet developed, as might have been expected, as a continuation ofthe successful counter-stroke on the Donets,, and it is probable that the RussianKharkov offensive has caused a postponement rather than an acceleration ofthe main German attack, which still appears unlikely before mid-June.Libya.28th May.18. On the afternoon of the 28th May, the attack on El Adem, which hadbeen broken off the previous day, was continued by the German Light Division.This attack was repulsed by one of our armoured formations, the enemy breakingoff the engagement and withdrawing in a north-westerly direction to join hisarmoured concentration. This concentration was engaged in what developedinto the main battle in an area south and south-west of Acroma, centring around the junction known as Knightsbridge, where practically the entire enemy armoured force was committed.A German force from this area which included some 100 tanks moved towardsAcroma but instead of carrying out this threat it divided into two columns, thefirst crossing the coast road and the second moving west along $he El Ademescarpment.   These columns were later forced to withdraw.The Italian Mobile Corps which had moved up inside our minefields was attacked and split by our armoured forces, but the enemy was able to make a gap. in our minefield in the area 10 miles N.N.-W. of Bir Hakeim.
29th May.19. On the 29th the main armoured battle continued in the area south ofAcroma. Our entire armoured forces took the offensive and were heavily engaged.Tank casualties on both sides were heavy and although no decision was reachedthe enemy was undoubtedly prevented from carrying out his original intention.At this stage supply difficulties, aggravated by our constant attacks both in theair and on the ground against this vital weakness, caused the enemy considerable anxiety. He succeeded, however, in making a second gap in our minefield nearMteifel (20 miles west of Knightsbridge).A subsidiary attack from the west was made against out Gazala positions butthis was held up.30th May.20. By the afternoon of the 30th there were strong indications that theenemy would attempt to withdraw his forces through the gaps he had made inoar minefields. The importance of preventing this was realised. Our armoured forces and an infantry brigade were heavily engaged in this task during thecourse of the day. The main battle moved from Acroma towards the west andisolated detachments of enemy armour and ALT. were being attacked betweenMteifel and Acroma.31st May.21. On the 31st the main battle was still centred around gaps in our mine-fields and the most strenuous fighting appeared to be taking place along the lineof the Trigh Capuzzo. Here the enemy established a bridgehead at the Mteifelgap, strong in anti-tank artillery; we were unable to close the gap, although itwas kept under continuous artillery fire.Fighting was still going on around Knightsbridge against concentrations of enemy M.T. and to the south mopping-up was continued east of Bir Hakeim.In the afternoon the 150th Brigade, which was disposed south of the Mteifelgap, was heavily attacked from the north.1st June.22. By the 1st June it became apparent that the enemy was in three groups :one armoured group guarding the bridgehead at Mteifel, a second armouredgroup which had escaped was further west, and a third subsidiary group con-sisting of two battalions of the German Light Division was in front of ourposition around Gazala. The two armoured groups each contained about halfof his available tanks.The attack on the 150 th Brigade was continued during the night the31st May/1st June, and, as communication with it had been lost, it was feared that it was no longer offering organised resistance.A column of armoured cars of the King&apos;s Dragoon Guards pushed forward to Segnali, which they found unoccupied; a portion of the Free French Brigadewas accordingly moved from Bir Hakeim to take over this position, from whichit would be able to harass enemy lines of supply. Heavy fighting continued inthe neighbourhood of Alteifel and an attempt was made to block the exit to thewest by moving 7th Motor Brigade round Bir Hakeim to intercept any enemywho might escape.2nd June.23. On the 2nd a very severe sandstorm interfered with operations untillate in the day. A heavy tank battle took place in the evening, during which theenemy succeeded in occupying Eluet El Tamar (10 miles W.S.W. of Acroma). inthe initial stages, but was later compelled to evacuate it with the loss of 14 tanks.The same evening Bir Hakeim was subjected to a strong attack by Germanand Italian tanks and parts of the Italian Pavia and Brescia Infantry Divisions;a portion of the Trieste Division was also engaged. The attack which was made from north-west and east of our positions was assisted by air support and apparently continued into the night of 2nd/3rd,
3rd June..24. By tine morning of the 3rd our armoured forces had occupied Eluet ElTamar and enemy tanks were withdrawing westwards in the Sidra area.The attack on Bir Hakeim was resumed and was now assisted by the use ofStukas. The garrison are reported to have refused two calls for surrender andare resisting strongly.Motorised columns of our forces have been engaged in harassing the enemylines of supply to the west of our original positions in the area south of MteifelGeneral,25. It was learned that during the fighting on the 29th May GeneralMesservy was captured by the German Light Division but after a day in captivityhe escaped disguised as a private soldier. By the 30th he was again in command of his division.General Cruwwell, commander of the German Afrika Korps. was capturedwhen his aircraft was shot down on the 31st.India Burma China.Assam Front.26. There has been no contact with the enemy during the past week. a japanese force of all arms about 1,500 strong is east of the Chindwin River inthe Homalin area. There has been considerable activity of river craft up the chindwin but no evidence yet of enemy reinforcements on a large scale. A smallChinese force is still trying to make its way across the river to rejoin our troopsin the Imphal area.Yunnan Front.27.   General Stilwell has arrived at Chungking.Apart from inconclusive skirmishing round Tengyueh and Lungling therehas been little activity on this front during the past week. The immediate objectof the Japanese appears to be consolidation up as far as the Salween River.Intelligence.Far East.28. Troop movements through Tientsin indicate the reinforcement of japanese forces in Manchuria by one division and a corresponding decrease intheir strength in North China. Japan&apos;s tendency to increase her dispositionsagainst Russia is of interest although this movement is not in, sufficient strength to have any immediate implication.AIR SITUATION.General.29. The number of sorties despatched by Bomber Command was the highestfor any one week since the commencement of the war, and on two nights over1.000 aircraft were despatched to Cologne and Essen respectively.Coastal Command aircraft made two successful attacks on enemy convoys.Enemy attacks on this country by night were on a somewhat heavier scale.Our air forces in Libya provided very effective support for our ground forces.United Kingdom.30. Fighter Command flew 5,366 sorties by day and 769 by night. Thesetotals compare with 2,595 and 206 during last week.Enemy day activity against this country was. on a small scale and operations by fighter-bombers were less frequent than of late.Enemy night operations were on a larger scale than during the previousAveek. Five attacks were made by an average of approximately fifty bombers.The primary targets appeared to be Canterbury, Ipswich and Poole, but with theexception of one raid on Canterbury the attacks were widespread and not very effective. ,Ten raiders were destroyed, four others probably destroyed and six damaged-
Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.31. The weather was more favourable, and, as a result, there wasa large increase in our offensive activity, Fighter and Bomber Commandsdespatching 2,692 and 40 sorties respectively, compared with 691 and 4 last week.Eight bombing operations, involving 30 Bostons and 30 Hurricane bombers,were carried out. The targets were the docks at Flushing, Bruges, Dieppe andCherbourg, a power station at Havre, a parachute factory at Calais, and militarycamps in the Foret d&apos;Eu (near Le Treport). The attacks on the docks were inall cases carried out in good visibility, and the majority of bombs are estimated to have fallen in the target areas except at Cherbourg, where they overshot andfell near a barracks and a power station. One hit is claimed on the main building of the parachute factory at Calais. The military camps at Foret d&apos;Eu could notbe identified, but railway tracks, a station and a factory near Le Treport, and agasometer near Ault were bombed as alternatives.During these operations, 107 squadrons of Spitfires operated as escorts andon diversionary sweeps. Six enemy aircraft were destroyed, three were probably destroyed and twelve were damaged. In addition, a number of objectives,including wireless stations, trains and factories were attacked from low levels.Fourteen Spitfires are missing, but one pilot was rescued.Following upon the heavy night bombing attacks on Cologne and Essen(reported later in this resume), a total of ten Mosquitos operating singly were despatched on bombing reconnaissances of these objectives. Bombs were dropped by seven aircraft.  Two Mosquitos failed to return.Thirteen sweeps, involving a total of 89 squadrons of Spitfires, were carriedout over Northern France, but the majority were uneventful. Eight enemy fighters were destroyed, another was probably destroyed and twelve were damaged.Fourteen Spitfires are missing from these sweeps, but one pilot is safe.In the course of small-scale harassing attacks by three Mustangs of army co-operation Command and ten Spitfires of Fighter Command, two goods trains,a wireless station, a machine-gun tower and other objectives were attacked. .Night.32. Our bombing during the week was on the heaviest scale since thecommencement of the war, a total of 2,618 sorties being despatched by bomber Command against land targets. The night of the 30th/31st May alsomarked the first occasion in the history of air warfare upon which a force of over1,000 bombers was despatched against one objective.The target selected for this attack was Cologne, against which 1,043aircraft were despatched. The attack was carried out in perfect weather andwas concentrated into one hour and a half, during which time 530 tons of H.E.(including 86 x 4,000 lbs.) and 929 tons of incendiaries were dropped. Theoperation is considered to have been a complete success, and the intensity of thefires surpassed anything previously seen. A preliminary assessment of damage from photographs taken on 1st June is shown at Appendix VII. On the samenight, 49 Blenheims of Bomber Command were despatched to attack enemy aero-dromes. Four enemy aircraft were destroyed, two were probably destroyed and one was damaged.   Forty-three of our bombers failed to return.Two nights later, another force of over 1,000 bombers was despatched,957 of which were directed against Essen and 49 against enemy aerodromes.The weather over Essen was disappointing, much variable cloud and a groundhaze making target identification difficult. Four hundred and forty tons of H.E.(including 54 x 4,000 lbs.) and 795 tons of incendiaries were dropped, and although many extensive fires were seen, they were neither as intense nor as concentratedas at Cologne. Many aircraft which were unable to identify their primary targetdropped bombs on other built-up areas in the Ruhr. Six enemy aircraft were destroyed.   Our losses were 35 aircraft missing.Three other important attacks were carried out during the week when the targets were Essen and Bremen, and the Gnome-Rhone works at Gennevilliers,Paris.At Gennevilliers, 140 tons of H.E. (including 39 x 4,000 lbs.) were dropped from between 8,000 and 2,000 feet in moderate weather conditions.   Damage
inflicted in this raid as assessed from interpretation of photographs taken on theday following the attack is reported in Appendix VII.In the second attack on Essen, 195 aircraft were despatched, and 91 tons ofH.E. (including 24 x 4,000 lbs.) and 191 tons of incendiaries were dropped. Onthis occasion there was no cloud but ground haze and smoke again hamperedidentification and observation of results. Several large fires and many smallerones were seen distributed over a considerable area.At Bremen, against which 170 aircraft were despatched, 96 tons of H.E.(including 20 x 4,000 lbs.) and 151 tons of incendiaries were dropped. Severalflares were also dropped and were found to be of great assistance in illuminatingthe target. The weather was cloudless, but with considerable ground haze. Manyfires, several very large, were started in the town and dock area. One particularlylarge oil fire, with smoke rising to a great height, was observed. The town gasworks is believed to have been hit.From these three operations, 29 bombers are missing.Subsidiary attacks were made on Cherbourg and Dieppe, but no importantresults have been reported.Harassing operations against enemy aerodromes and railway objectives were carried out every night of the week by a total of 155 aircraft of Fighter command and six aircraft of Coastal Command. Bombs were dropped on about 20aerodromes in Northern France and the Low Countries. About 35 goods trainswere attacked, one of which blew up. At least 15 railway engines were disabled.Other objectives attacked included five factories, a causeway over the Zuyder Zee.the harbour at Ijmuiden, the railway yards and power station at Caen, a numberof &quot; E &quot; boats and other small craft, and numerous other objectives, such assearchlights, machine-gun posts, &amp;c. In addition, nine enemy aircraft were destroyed, one was probably destroyed and ten were damaged. One Boston andtwo Hurricanes are missing.Coastal Operations.33. Coastal Command flew 628 sorties of which 38 were on convoy escort.Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 1,074 sorties.Forty-one aircraft of Bomber Command laid 120 sea mines. Two of these aircraft are missing.Two successful attacks were made on enemy convoys by aircraft of coastal command. In the first, 21 Hudsons were despatched to attack a convoy consistingof ten merchant vessels and four escort vessels which had been sighted off Vlieland.Directs hits with bombs were made on eight ships of between 1.000 and 3,500 tons,and fires were seen to break out in six.   One Hudson was lost.In the second operation, 28 aircraft took off to attack shipping off the frisian islands. A convoy of 14 merchant vessels with five escort vessels was sightedand attacked, and eight ships ranging from 1,000 to 6,000 tons were hit with bombs.   Six of our aircraft were lost.Attacks were made by single Fludsons on a 3,000-ton merchant vessel anda tanker of 6/8,000 tons off the Norwegian coast but no definite results were seen.Spitfires and Hurricane bombers damaged two minesweepers and sank an armed trawler off Walcheren. and attacked two ships of about 500 tons offUshant, one of which was left listing. In these operations, one enemy fighterwas destroyed and another was damaged. Two Spitfires and a Hurricane bomberwere lost but one pilot is safe.About 75 enemy aircraft were engaged in shipping and weatherreconnaissances off our coasts. One enemy aircraft was probably destroyed andthree were damaged.&quot;Mediterranean.Libya and Egypt..34. Throughout the week our air forces have given support in the landbattles and have supplied Army and Air Force headquarters with informationof the progress of the operations.Light bombers, fighter bombers and fighters continued in making low-flyingattacks on enemy concentrations wherever possible, and successfully responded to special calls from the Army for close support.
Heavy attacks were made in the Knightsbridge and Bir Hakeim areas andon both sides of the gaps in our minefields. . Continuous and successful attacks were also made on enemy supply columns, resulting in widespread damage,disorder and delay. Full details are not available, but it was estimated that nearly 650 vehicles and tanks were destroyed or damaged in four days. Sand-storms restricted operations during the latter part of the week. A total of 59 ofour fighters are missing, but at least 10 pilots have returned safely to our lines.By night, heavy attacks were made on enemy landing grounds at Derna,Martuba and El Tmimi, and on two occasions mines were laid in Benghaziharbour.Enemy fighters patrolled their landing grounds, made sweeps over the battle area and provided escort for reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. fighter bombers were employed mainly against troop concentrations and aerodromes.Dive bombers operated in small formations of six or seven aircraft against our troops in the forward area, and against battery positions and concentrations ofM.T. and tanks.A number of these attacks were intercepted by our fighters, who inflictedcasualties on the enemy and forced the bombers to jettison their bombs.German long-range bombers, mostly based in Greece and Crete, have operatedat night against our aerodromes and M.T. columns, and bombed concentrations of tanks in the El Adem and Sicli Rezegh area. One He. 126 landed near therailway east of Capuzzo, carried.out demolitions, and the crew made good theirescape, leaving the aircraft behind intact.Thirty-eight enemy aircraft were destroyed, eleven probably destroyed andmany others damaged.Malta.35. Enemy bomber attacks on Malta were on a small scale. Smallformations of Me. 109s, never more than 25 in number, made daily sweeps overthe Island, and on a few occasions fighter bombers dropped bombs on the aero-dromes at Luqa, Hal Far and Takali, damaging a small number of aircraft on theground.One of the chief tasks of the German Air Force in Sicily seems to be the purely passive one of providing escort for Italian bombers in their sporadicattacks on the Island, and keeping our Spitfires in the air.A number of small and ineffective attacks were carried out at night, mostof the bombs falling in the sea-Four enemy aircraft were shot down, and a number of others were probably destroyed or damaged.Reinforcements of 32 Spitfires were despatched to Malta, two of which were shot down, two are missing and another crashed on landing.Sicily.36. On two nights six Wellingtons from Malta bombed Catania, aerodrome,making numerous hits on buildings and causing many fires. Two enemy fighterscollided during an attack on one of our bombers.Two attacks were also made on Messina, during one of which over 10 tonsof bombs were released. One 4,000-lb. bomb hit the jetty, causing repeatedexplosions, and another burst near oil tanks. A small attack was made on thesubmarine base at Augusta.Sea Communications.37. A south-bound merchant vessel of 7,000 tons was attacked by Swordfishand Albacores and two hits are believed to have been made.A vessel of 6,000 tons was torpedoed by Wellingtons and a Beaufort betweenDerna and Benghazi. A reconnaissance later revealed that the ship wasstationary and damaged.Burma.38. Small-scale attacks by Blenheims and Hudsons were made on targetsm the Chindwin River area. One barge was sunk, and three hits were made ona footbridge crossing the river at Kalewa. Jetties, warehouses, three motorlaunches and other river craft were damaged.Five Blenheims bombed Magwe aerodrome.[23904] c
Fortresses made two attacks on Myitkyina aerodrome, hitting the runwayon both occasions. Other Fortresses bombed docks and shipping at Rangoonwhere a tanker was hit and damaged.No enemy air activity has been reported.Pacific Zone.39. A total of twelve United States Fortresses made four attacks on Rabaul.Fires were started at the jetty and the wharf.Three attacks were also made on the aerodrome at Lae by a total of fourteenUnited States bombers. Fires were started among buildings, and hits were madeon the runway. Enemy fighters intercepted one attack, and two of them were destroyed and a further two were damaged.   One Marauder was lost.In Timor. Hudsons attacked Dilli, Koepang aerodrome, and Atamboes,where extensive fires were started and barracks were demolished. One Hudsonis missing.In the Solomon Islands, a total of twelve Catalmas attacked Tulagi andMakambo Island. Large fires were started at both targets. One enemy flyingboat was set on fire.Russia.40. On the 2nd June seventy-two bombers and fighters attacked Murmansk.The Russians claim to have destroyed nine bombers and three fighters for the lossof three Soviet Hurricanes. .        . .      ,   .There has been a noticeable increase in German air activity againstSevastopol.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.41.   No bombing occurred during the week.By Night.42 Bombing attacks took place on five nights during the period. The mostserious attack was at Canterbury on the 31st May/1st June, with a lesser one onthe 2nd/3rd June. On the other three nights there were scattered raids, cheifly the districts around Ipswich and Poole.   Casualties were not heavy.Damage.Cante?-bu?y (31st May j 1st June, 2nd]3rd June).43.

The above table is an aggregation of the material in the employment tables of non-tankers and tankers in Statistical Digests E and F respectively. in combining the figures for non-tankers with those for tankers, certain slight differences have had to be brought into a common form. The figures for non-tankers relateto the last day of the month while those for tankers relate to the 15th of the month to February 1912 and to the last day of the month from March 1942.(1) (a) Tankers on Admiralty service include vessels importing oil fuel to the United Kingdom; in April 1942 these comprised 17 tankers of 135,000 gross tons.(b) Non-tankers allocated to the fighting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A substantial part (in recent months nearly one-half) of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage (see note (3) ).(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eire.-v3
