THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  June 1942.7W.P. (42) 260SECEETCopy No.WAR CABINET.POSITION OF LAVAL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues herewith a minute by the Head of theFrench Department of the Foreign Office giving the substance of a telegram fromthe United States Charge d&apos;Affaires at Vichy about recent developments there.Mr. Matthews showed me this afternoon a telegram dated the 11th Junefrom the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires at Vichy, in which Mr. Tuck madethe following points : (1) By decree dated the 2nd June the Gendarmerie Nationale had beenplaced under the direct supervision and control of the Chief of theGovernment. Laval thus controlled the police as Minister of theInterior and the Gendarmerie as Chief of the Government.(2) The Legion had been transferred from the Minister of the Interior to theChief of the Government. (This change was formally sealed at aLegion dinner on the 10th June, at which Marshal Petain stated thatLaval and he were now marching hand in hand, that Laval wasgaining&apos;s everyone&apos;s confidence, not only by his words but by his acts,and that there were no more clouds between them.)(3) Laval had refused to reduce the bread ration in unoccupied France andhad increased the wine and meat ration. He had also improveddistribution. One thousand three hundred small factories for whichraw materials were not available had been closed down. Laval was nodoubt hoping that this would enable him to supply industrial workers for Germany.(4) Laval had instituted Departmental Councils. These were a compromise between the Conseils Generaux and the &quot;Commissions Departe-mentales.&quot; These Councils gave the people the illusion of participa-tion in the Government.Mr. Tuck concluded that Laval&apos;s prestige was on the up-grade, but he pointedout that the lack of faith in Laval&apos;s ultimate intentions was ever apparent.Military developments in Europe would largely influence and direct his future policy. For the moment he was proceeding cautiously and placing every possibleemphasis on his patriotic motives and on his loyalty to Petain.I was on the point of writing a minute more or less in the above sense when mr. Matthews called on me. I would have added that Laval has just given aslap in the face to Doriot by pronouncing publicly that he would not be allowedto hold any meetings in Unoccupied France.A. E.Foreign Office, June 18, 1942.11761   [23977]
Laval has already proved that as a tactician he is far superior to Darlan.When the latter took over his increased powers in February 1941, he tried to play a lone hand, and it was not until some months had elapsed that he realised thathis only hope was to shelter himself under Petain&apos;s umbrella. Laval has realised that his best chance was to do so at once, and from Petain&apos;s remarks, quoted inparenthesis in paragraph (2) above, the Marshal appears ready and anxiousto play.W. H. B. MACK.June 15, 1942.
