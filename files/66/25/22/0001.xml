0315B/15th May. &quot; &quot; &apos; &apos;ANNEX   at from:    admiralty to: S*0. Force F.III Date 15.5.42MOST IMMEDIATE.Following Personal from Prime Minister for AdmiralSyfret.1.     I want you to see clearly our picture of the Madagascaroperation.    It must he a help.and not a hindrance.    It must be a security and not a burden.   We cannot lock up activeField Army Troops there for any length of time.   The 13thand 17th Brigades must go on to India almost immediately.If you could take Tamatave and Majunga in the next few daysthey could help you in this, but they have got to go on anyhow,2.     Since IRONCLAD was conceived and executed the indian ocean situation has changed to our advantage.   Time has passed.    The Japanese have not yet pressed their attack uponCeylon or India.    On the contrary these dangers look lessnear and likely than before.    We gave them a rebuff at Colomboand Trincomalee at the beginning of April *    In the early days of July we hope to form the whole of the Eastern Fleet, namely:NELSON, RODNEY, WARSPITE AND VALIANT with the three Carriersand the four R.&apos;s, and to base this Fleet upon Colombo and port T.3*     If and when this is accomplished, Madagascar will be very far behind the front line.   one can hardly imagine theJapanese trying to take Diego Saurez with less than ten thousandmen in transports with battleship and Carrier escort involving a very large part of their limited Fleet.    They have to countevery ship even more carefully than we do in view of numericalinferiority.    I doubt very much whether they will attemptto establish lodgments or submarine bases in Madagascar now thatwe have the key points4.     Therefore your problem is one of holding the place withthe least subtraction from our limited resources.   You shouldmake up your minds whether you can do this by taking Tamataveand Majunga in the next few days and then sending on to india the 13th and 17th Brigades, (v/hich would also have the advantageof releasing the Naval Forces now employed in the Madagascar area which are so urgently required elsewhere), or whether you willmake yourselves comfortable at Diego.Saurez and try to wanglethings with the French and with the natives pending arrival ofthe Union Brigade and the first of the two African Brigades,after v/hich the 29th Brigade must move on.5.     It may be however you will think it better to let matterssimmer down and make some sort of modus Vivendi with the french authorities,   Money and trade facilities. should be used.Here at home we have had to indicate that the Free French willbe associated with Madagascar, but this is  03? the sake of keeping   the Movement going and it must be several months beforeFree French Representatives arrive - if ever.   Anyhow the localsituation will not be ruined by orders from home for theirsake *6.     The   way you can help the war best is to get the 13thand 17th Brigades on to India at earliest and the 29th Brigadewithin the next two months. Everything else is subordinate to thisexceut of course holding Diego Suarez, which must on no accountbe hazarded.   Cable fully but do not delay any action on which you may decide.S&quot;*    This telegram is agreed by 0.0.S. Committee and supersedeswhere necessary previous instructions.-1-

ANNEXBfcFROM:    D.O.TO:        SOUTH AFRICA  (H.C.)(Sent 3.0 p.m.  4th June,  1942).IMMEDIATE.No.  1022 MOST SECRET.Following Most Secret and Personal from Prime Minister forGeneral Smuts.      Begins.Thank you for your messages in High Commissioner^telegrams Wos.  948 of May 28th and 967 of June 1st.      I want toput clearly before you how we stand in Madagascar.2,     As I told you in my 0Z.245 to Cairo we had reluctantly toput off clearing up Tamatave and Majunga as it was necessary forthe 5th Division to get on to India at the earliest moment,      Wetherefore instructed General Sturges to make Diego Suarez securewith the minimum forces, and gave him authority to try to make some sort of arrangement with the Governor at Tananarive.3.      On the 27th May a British subject of the name of Barnettarrived at Diego Suarez from Tananarive with the story that hehad been asked by a member of the Governor&apos;s staff to try tofind a basis of agreement between Tananarive Government andBritish forces which would safeguard the honour, sovereignty andneutrality of Madagascar Government and put an end to bloodshed.Thereupon Sturges sent him an aide memoire,  the text of which isgiven in my immediately following telegram.      We do not care forall these proposals as they stand and doubt whether the Governorwill make acceptable counter-proposals.      We have directedSturges not to carry negotiations any further pending theGovernor&apos;s reply which he is to telegraph to us immediately,together with his comments in the light of the existing militarysituation.      So much for. the political side of the story.4.      The military picture is as follows:-(a) The Naval forces which took part in the Madgascaroperations have already been dispersed.      The carriers have joined Somerville&apos;s Fleet and the destroyers have gone to helpin the Mediterranean.(b) The assault shipping and landing craft are still in east African waters and can be reassembled.(c) Army.      The 13th British Brigade has already leftMadagascar and arrived in India.      The 22nd East African Brigadeis due at Diego Suarez this week and the 17th British Brigade ofthe 5th Division will then move on to India,      The Brigade which you are so very kindly providing is to go forward as soon as shipping is available, and the 27th East African Brigade is dueat Diego Suarez on approximately the 24th July.      The 29thBrigade will then move on to India and the Commando will probablyreturn home.

(3) Air Forces at present consist of your composite bomber-reconnaissance squadron (one flight mary lands and two flightsBeauforts);    -ne R.A.F.  flight (six Lysanders);    and a fewLodestars.5.     General Sturges reported on the 14-th May that one brigade and cne Commando would be required for the capture of eitherTamatave or Majunga:    that since almost all the assault shipping would be required for each attack,  it would not be possible tocarry out the two operations simultaneously;    and that the navaJforces required would be of  bhe order of one aircraft carrier,one cruiser,  six destroyers,  three corvettes, minesweepers, etc.General Sturges also estimated that,  in view of the decision thatthe Free French sh uld be associated with us in the administrationof Madagascar5. Tamatave and Majunga would each require a brigade group as a permanent garrison-      I d   not accept the view thatsuch large forces would be required merely to garrison these places after resistance had been overcome-  and I consider thatthe evil effects of Free French participation,  though real, areexaggerated..6.     From this, however., you will see that General Sturgesregards the capture of Tamatave and Majunga as fairly formidableoperations.      It would be vexatious to have a failure and getentangled.      Our experience has been that the Vichy French areapt to fight hard unless attacked by -obviously superior forces,and are particularly bitter when the Free French are involved.7.      If no arrangement is possible with the local Government aiidv/e still want to clear urj Tamatave and Majunga,  the bestopportunity would be after the arrival of the 27th Fast AfricanBrigade, ch the 24-th july and before the. departure for India, of   -the 29th Brigade and the Commando       It is, however, impossibleto say so far, ahead of the time whether the necessary naval forces could be made available.8. We sh-uld be very ready to be guided by your views. Wouldyou care to have General Sturges fly to see you, or could you goto Diego Suarez yourself?     Ends.TYPEXFROM;      D,0,TO; SOUTH AFRICA (H.C.)(Sent 3r15 p,m,  4th June,  1942),IMIvIEDIATENo.  1023 MOST SECRETFollowing moot secret and personal from Prime Minister forGeneral Smuts.      Begins,My immediate preceding telegram.      Following are contents ofAide Memcire. -    (Begins),1-      The British forces have only   ne objective to deny islandQf Madagascar and novel base of Diego Sarrez to Japanese and toProtect island from  at took..

2,     The objective is wholly strategic and British forces willfce withdrawn at the end of the war or at an earlier date ifstrategy allows.3,     The first step towards this objective has been to take measures for defence of Diego Suarez.      This is being done andBHtish Commander pays a high tribute to co-operation and publicspirit Of French community in that place.4,      The next step must be to take measures for defence of neutrality of remainder of Madagascar.      The Commander of theBritish forces would of course prefer that these measures should betaken in full collaboration with French naval and militaryauthorities and that French naval and military personnel shouldcombine in practical measures to be conducted in defence of port and air fields. .   But if this were unacceptable British Commanderwfuld ask an assurance that full permission to take such measures as were necessary should be granted by French Authorities.      these should include use of all ports and airfields and should be accompanied by a bona fide offer of full co-operation excludingactual employment of French forces but including use of the french coast defences and A.A.  armaments wherever British forces shoulddeem it necessary.5.     The French flag would be flown as it is to-day.      The british forces would respect French sovereignty throughout island.      Theywould recognize Monsieur Annet as Governor General of Madagascaracting sn behalf of France and would be happy to co-operate in anyway with his present administration of island.      French Courtswould be respected and French civil administration assisted inevery way.6.      The British Commander v/ould ask that French troops ether thanthose who might be allowed to collaborate in defence of ports and airfields should be maintained at a strength necessary for the safeguarding of internal security in island.      The location ofthese troops would form part of a subsequent agreement.      In theevent of agreement on this the British Commander would not (repeatnot) wish to maintain British troops in the capital and would suggest retention there of a British Mission of Liaison whose members would be unarmed (Americans might be. included).7.     The British Commander would wish to ensure economic prosperity of island and with this aim would recommend conclusion of aneconomic agreement whereby Madagascar would receive suppliesnecessary for her welfare and whereby main products of islandwould be&apos;purchased by British or allied concerns.      (Both these measures have already been taken at Diego Suarez).8.     The British Commander would extend to a limited number inrest of island the facilities for repatriation already granted tothose officials at Diego Suarez whose consciences did not (repeatnot) allow them to co-operate with British Authorities.9.     If agreement could be reached on lines indicated in preceding paragraphs hostilities would cease.10o    It is felt that if at a very early date an officialrepresentative of the Governor General submitted proposals and terms based on the above reasonable anticipation of early agreement could be enjoyed but it must not be inferred that foregoingParagraph has any official aspect or that thereby is complied any undertaking to abstain in meantime from a further military action.Ends.

It is certain nobody wishes to continue toight against us, that all fear attack from the Japanese, and if leftto themselves most would wish to co-operate with us against them.    Inlego Suarez several French military and civil officials have asked toorra species of Home Guard in order to fight with us and release oursoldiers for front line duties.The attack by Japanese submarines the appearance of Japaneseircr-aft and destruction   of 2 Japanese officers have made all French-.en in authority sit up and take notice.

Begins.Reference my telegram No.  1001&quot; containing Smuts&apos;views on Madagascar policy I venture to submit my own views.      In conversation, with me Smuts used even moreemphatic language as to the unwisdom of General Sturgess&apos;proposals for seeking the co-operation of M. Anet and otherVichy officials in unoccupied Madagascar.      He was at a loss to understand the reason for this continued policy ofappeasement of Laval&apos; s henchmen whose.clear aim it is tohelp the Axis in every way possible.      He expressed graveuneasiness over Sturgess apparent point of view.     This Ishare personally.      My considered view is that the longerwe delay occupation and really effective control of capital,ports, wireless stations at present in Vichy control theharder will be our task later.     Evidence that JapaneseNaval officers have already got into neighbourhood, of Diegoand recent movement of Vichy officers and officials fromUnion into Portuguese East Africa (see my telegram No. 9995th June) as well as actual attacks on our ships in Diegoell point to extreme danger of hesitation further overpolicy of getting complete and effective control of wholeisland.      In this my own view I know that I have thesupport of the Admiral C.-in-C. South Atlantic,  the wholeof our To&amp;d organisation and Colonel Pechkoff.      i therefore share to the full Mr. ChurchillTs doubts as tothe proposals for an attempted deal with Mr. Anet.      one might equally attempt similar deal with Vichy Governor-General at Dakar.      I hope that present evident policy ofGeneral Sturgess may be overridden and policy of completeoccupation of Madagascar with elimination of all Vichyofficials will be adopted.     Ends.x Attached.
