THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT- -     ^ &apos;Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1942.MOST SECRET.W.P. (42) 241.June 5, 1942.Jjf Copy No.     28TO EE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ANGLO-SOVIET RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may be interested to see the annexed note by Mr. ChristopherWarner, the Head of the Northern Department of the Foreign Office, recordinga conversation with the two members of the Soviet Delegation to the recentAnglo-Soviet discussions on Chemical Warfare.2. I think that Mr. Warner,, who presided over these discussions, deservescredit for the way in which the negotiations were handled.A. E.Foreign Office, June 5, 1942.ANNEX.I LUNCHED to-day with M. Kasatkin, the Deputy Commissar forChemical Industry, and M. Sevastianov, who composed the Soviet delegation on Chemical Warfare and who were leaving on their return to the Soviet Unionjust afterwards.2. M. Kasatkin expressed great satisfaction with the results of his visit and said, as he had said once before during the official conversations, that thefriendliness and helpfulness he had found here had been a very pleasant surpriseto him. (He coupled this remark especially with the name of the Foreign Office-but I hope that in doing so he intended to refer to our helpfulness ratherthan to the surprise this caused him!)3. He then referred to the other conversations which had taken placewhile he was here, saying that they marked a great step forward in ourrelations. Indeed, he said, this had been a bumper month with Libya, Cologneand Kharkov added to the record. When he toasted our successful collaboration in bringing the war to a speedy termination perhaps this year I added :&quot;and our collaboration for at least another twenty years.&quot; He took up thepoint with enthusiasm and added the hope that the United States would bejoined to us in our collaboration.11743   [23918]
24. M. Kasatkin and M. Sevastianov gave every appearance of sincerityand real cordiality in making these remarks. M. Kasatkin is perhaps rather more of the professor and the scientist than the politician and gave me andthe rest of our Delegation who met him an impression of straightforwardnessonce he had got over his initial extreme caution; I think it possible that his remarks about the Treaty were something more than polite phrases.5. M. Sevastianov (who speaks English while M. Kasatkin does not),during a few minutes alone with me, further expatiated on the success of boththeir own mission and the more important political one.C. F. A. WARNER.June 3, 1942.
