THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSPrinted for the War Cabinet.   June 1942.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (42) 267.June 25, 1942.WAR CABINET.DISCUSSIONS IN WASHINGTON ON POST-WAR RELIEF.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the President of theBoard of Trade and the Paymaster-General.IN the Memorandum on Post-War Relief, communicated by Mr. Winant onthe 11th May, the United States Government asked that Sir Frederick Leith-Rossshould go to Washington to participate in a round-table discussion which it wassuggested should be held in Washington as soon as possible between representativesof the British, American, Soviet and Chinese Governments, as a preliminary toa conference of all the United Nations. His Majesty&apos;s Government have agreedto this proposal and it is necessary to settle the instructions which should be givento Sir Frederick Leith-Ross.2. The primary object of the round-table discussion is to agree on a schemeof organisation for handling the problem of post-war relief, on the basis of combined action by the United Nations. After consultation with the Dominionsand India, His Majesty&apos;s Government had informed the United States Govern-ment that they welcomed the broad lines of the suggestions made by the UnitedStates Government. They have, however, drawn attention to certain points raisedby the Dominions and to the need of taking account of the susceptibilities of theAllied Governments, and they have assumed that at the Washington meetingsadjustments could be made in the United States proposals in so far as it was found expedient. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, as Chairman of the Inter-AlliedCommittee, is familiar with the difficulties of securing an effective Inter-Alliedorganisation, and he should be given discretion to deal with the organisationalaspects of the problem in whatever manner seems to him most likely to reconcile the divergent interests of the Governments concerned. He should urge that a branch of the United Nations Relief Bureau should be established in London andthat it should be given substantial powers in regard to the allocation of Europeanrelief; but he should not press this suggestion against the views of the otherGovernments if it appears likely to involve the United Kingdom in undueresponsibility for the provision of relief. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross has authorityto agree that the United Kingdom should bear a proportionate share in theadministrative costs of the organisation.3. The next question likely to be discussed is as to how supplies of food-stuffs and raw materials can be made available to the relief organisation.Sir Frederick Leith-Ross should ascertain what proposals the United StatesGovernment have in mind on this subject and whether they contemplate theextension of lease-lend supplies or the provision of credits or relief donations.Should the question be raised as to the contribution which the United KingdomGovernment are prepared to make, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross should refer to the[24001]
oPrime Minister^ statement of the 20th August, 1940, which defined the generalpolicy, of the United Kingdom : &quot;We can and we will arrange in advance for the speedy entry of foodinto any.part of the enslaved area, when this part has been wholly cleared ofGerman forces and has genuinely regained its freedom. We shall do our best to encourage the building up of reserves of food all over the world, sothat there will always be held up before the&quot; eyes of the people of Europe,including I say it deliberately the German and Austrian peoples, the certainty that the shattering of the Nazi power will bring to tlhem allimmediate food, freedom and peace.&quot;He should say that His Majesty&apos;s Government are ready to help to the efullest extent of their ability, both as regards supplies and shipping, but he should pointout that we cannot yet say what our own position will be after the war and whatstocks will in fact be available over and above our own requirements. The supplyof raw materials required for the purpose of restoring industry and employmentin the liberated countries is on a somewhat different plane from the supply offood and other necessities of life and raises wider and more complicated issues.It would be necessary to ascertain the views and intentions of the United states administration, which, if will be remembered, will not supply us with rawmaterials even in war time except under conditions intended to safeguard theirown export trade. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross could, however, say that, in so faras we hold any stocks and stores after the war which are not immediately needed for our own requirements, we shall be prepared to place tlhem at the disposal ofthe international Relief Organisation either as a donation or against replacementas circumstances permit. Should he be pressed for any further statement as toour contribution, Sir Frederick should say that he is not authorised to enter into any definite commitments and that he must refer back for instructions.4. A number of questions will, however, arise in regard to the co-ordinationof Allied purchases and requirements. Impatient at the delay in establishing an effective international scheme, certain of the Allied Governments have startedpurchasing supplies independently for the post-war needs of their countries, andthese purchases are hampering the British and American supply departments intheir task of securing supplies needed for the common war effort. Sir frederick leith-Ross should join with the United States in pressing that all Alliedpurchasing should be co-ordinated, the necessary arrangements for this purposebeing worked out with the joint Food and Supply Boards in the United States.But similar arrangements are likely to be required after the war, so long asshortages exist, if a competitive scramble for supplies and wild movements ofprices are to be avoided. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross is authorised to say that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are prepared to participate in co-operative arrangementsfor this purpose, covering the allocation both of supplies and of transport.5. In this connexion, the question may be raised whether His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom will be prepared to maintain a system of rationing and other controls in the United Kingdom so long as necessary to ensurethe minimum supplies needed for the liberated countries. Mr. Winant has intimated that a statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government that they would beprepared to continue rationing as long as foodstuffs are short will have a very helpful effect on public sentiment in the United States, and that the president would be prepared to make some pronouncement in the same spirit. A programmeof Allied requirements is being drawn up under our auspices based on the presentBritish rations, adjusted to take account of differences in national diets andnutritional needs. A statement of the character indicated would have a valuableeffect generally on our European Allies, as showing the genuine desire of theUnited Kingdom Government to assist in solving post-war problems. It appearsmore than probable that, for other reasons, it will be necessary to maintainrationing, and other controls, in this country for some time after the war, and,if so, we may as well get such credit as we can from this policy.The question has been discussed by the Ministerial Committee onTieconstruction Problems, who remitted to a Committee of Officials the task of drafting a formula in the light of the recorded discussion. The Committee,proceeding accordingly, unanimously put forward the formula annexed. Webelieve that a statement on the lines of this formula is necessary and desirable;
hut if it is felt that the formula would be made more acceptable to public opinion in this country if limited to the needs of Allied countries, we are prepared toamend the last words so as to read &quot; So long as the available supplies are not sufficient to meet the urgent needs of Allied countries which have regained their freedom.&quot;6. We ask the War Cabinet (a) to approve the instructions for sir Frederick Leith-Ross set out in paragraphs 1 to 4 above; (b) to approve theformula attached, as amended, and to decide whether it should be announced by ministers in the United Kingdom or whether Sir Frederick Leith-Ross should beauthorised to use it in the course of his discussions in the United States.THE people of the United Kingdom are willing to join with the other united nations in doing all in their power to bring relief to countries which have beenstripped by our common enemies.The co-operative arrangements that are being built up during the war forthe allocation of supplies between the United Nations cannot be demobilised assoon as the war ends, but will have to be maintained during the period ofdisorganisation which must follow the cessation of hostilities. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, for their part, are ready to join in working-out and giving effect to common plans for the provision of transport and for theallocation of post-war supplies both of foodstuffs and of other essential goods onan equitable basis to meet minimum needs while acute shortages continue.As part of the common plan for relief they^^^tje prepared to continue inthis country after the end of hostilities the rationing of food and clothing andother suitable measures of control over essential commodities so long as theavailable supplies are not sufficient to meet the urgent needs of distressedcountries. *A.
