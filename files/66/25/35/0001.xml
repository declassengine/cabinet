As.it is highly important that, opinion (particularlyin America) should not be- taken by surprise ii repressivemeasures are forced on us, I am taking steps to warn HisMajesty&apos;s Representatives in Washington, Kuibyshev andChungking and the United Kingdom High Commissioners in theDominions, of the present situation and its Possible out-come ma message which might be used as guidance toresponsible Editors.This memorandum, is for the information only of theWar Cabinet at the present stage, and is circulated inorder that bhe background of possible developments rnav be readily.available.   It is not unlikely that early next month a decision of great importance may have to be taken -and at short notice. &apos;   &quot;INDIA OFFICE,16th June 1942.APPENDIX i telegram from Government of India, Home Department, dated7th June 1942.4484     ^xtract7Congress War Resolution of May 1st was based onDraft which we had reason to believe was Gandhi&apos;c.   Thishas now been confirmed by search of Congress Office andseizure inter -alia of most illuminating summary ofWorking Committee&apos;s discussion on the Draft Resolution.Summary shows that Gandhi&apos;s Draft was opposed by Nehruand others on the ground that &quot;it would be generally inter-preted as definite line-up with the Axis Powers andidentify Congress in the eyes of the world as theirpassive partner.   Draft was therefore revised by Nehru andalthough voting originally went against his version,President finally succeeded in persuading working committee to accept it.   Nehru made it clear that hisopposition to Gandhi was not based on any desire to help the British Government and final Draft as published mayfairly be regarded, against this background, as merelydisguising what Gandhi wishec1 to proclaim openly.2.     Since then Gandhi has shown clearly both by hiswritings in Harijan and also by what he said at secretinterview with Congress Workers in Bombay, record of whichhas come into our hands, that he is either feeling his way or has decided to launch fresh civil disobedience movement.His motive presumably is to re-establish Congressprestige, which has beoh badly damaged by their failurewith Cripps and by Rajagopalachari&apos;s defection, and moreparticularly to re-assert his own personal ascendency.No have no definite information yet what form the movementwill take nor what support he will succeed in gettingeither from Working Committee or from public, but we have more than one indication that he. is in desperate mood.It is indeed possible that he may launch personal movement

if he cannot carry Working Committee with him, and present indications are that he will throw off all pretensions ofnon-embarrassment, declare himself openly anti-British, as indeed he has always been, and endeavour to organise massmovement based on exploitation of .anti-British sentiment.Movement may start in threatened provinces by organisedopposition to acquisition of lands for aerodromes etc, andevacuation of villages for military purposes.   Slogansselected will almost certainly be connected with his plan for British withdrawal from India,   So far he has not hada good press; there has been considerable criticism of his policy both from public men and even in Nationalist press;and it is- clear that he and Nehru still do not see eyo toeye.   In accordance with his usual practice Gandhi hasalready made it clear, that he will give us due notice ofhis intentions.3,     In all these circumstances it would be unwise for usto enter the arena at present.   Any intervention on our part would merely stiffen Gandhi&apos;s attitude and might wellrally present opponents or waverers to his cause.   Wotherefore propose to wait and see.   But we must have our plans ready and one matter that we consider of prime importance is that public opinion in England and even more in America should be prepared well in advance for anystrong action we may eventually decide to take, &apos; Wesuggest that Press in England and important Americancorrespondents should be taken into confidence with,object of exposing Gandhi and. Congress.Telegram from Viceroy dated 11th June, 1942.1757,Personal,   I&apos; sent you by bag of June 2nd text ofdocument seized from office of All-India CongressCommittee during police search on May. 26th, givingdiscussion on Gandhi&apos;s resolution for consideration of thecommittee.   These papers are illuminating in a high degreeand bring out forcibly not only various trends of opinioninside Working Committee out extent to which certain members of that body recognise that attitude taken byGandhi admits of being represented as re-insurance against japanese, or approximating to positive assistanc e to themin the event of invasion,2,   Much will depend, as I have always maintained, on progress of war and extent to which we are able to confrontLeft-wing Nationalist India end those elements of-commerce and political which are anxious to re-insure, withvictories in field in air or at sea, and so make themthink again about possibility of victory for our enemies.I think I detect already, even in case of Gandhi himself,slight indication in his &quot;latest utterances in Harijan thathe may feel a little less certain than he did as toultimate outcome of war,   I have no intention of allowingmyself to be stanpeded into a rush decision on line to betaken, and I am not unduly alarmed or disturbed by attitudeof Congress or Gandhi&apos;s own machinations.   But I think youwill probably agree with me as to advantage of lettingCabinet see this very important document, for circumstances might arise in which were Gandhi to press his point of view and endeavour to get us in a corner, we might have to takedrastic action against him, either by depriving him of hisliberty, or, possibly, even by removing him from the country.

3.    I have no intention oi debating a hypotheticalposition by telegram.   I would only comment that I appreciate to oho full arguments against such action solong as ig can be avoided:   I realise in particular (asresult of close contact with American correspondents here)the extent to which it would be open to misunderstandingand woula be damaging to us in U.S.A., and fact that ghandi&apos;s publicity value in that country is so great thatthere is very little that he could not hone to got away with even in face of argument that his policy was onelikely to result in loss of American lives and in injury to American interests.   There is not the least likelihoodin those circumstances;, that I shall act in a hurry (or unless circumstances make it inevitable) at all; and inany event, I snail of course report anything I have inmind ior consideration of Cabinet and yourself.   It thereare any points about which, when you have seen theAllahabad discussions, you would like to consult melurther,&apos; I hope you will not fail to do so.APPENDIX II,.All India C^ri^ressaCommittee War fiosolutionMay j. sXl        ,In view of the imminentperil of invasion thatconfronts India, and theattitude of the BritishGovernment, as shown again in the recent proposalssponsored by Sir stafford cripps, the All india congress Committee has to declare afresh India&apos;policy and to advise thepeople in regard to theaction to be undertaken inthe emergencies that may arise in the immediatefuture.The proposals of theBritish Government andtheir subsequent elucidat-ion by Sir Stafford Crippshave led to greater bitter-ness and distrust of thatGovernment and the spiritof non-cooperation with britain has grown.    Theyhave demonstrated there evenin this hour of danger, notonly to India but to thecause of the United Nations,the British government functions as an Imperialistgovernment and refused torecognise the independence of India or to part with any eal power.   Ind ia&apos;sOrigjlnal Dr aft, of congress War Resolutionas &apos; uur to Woarj.firigCoMai&quot;fcteo&quot; oil&quot;  Teh AprilWhereas the British WarCabinet1 s proposed s sponsored by Sir Stafford Cripps haveshown up British imperialismin its nakedness as neverbefore, the All india congress Committee has cometo the following conclusions,The A.I.C.C. is ofopinion that Britain isincapable of defending India.It is natural that whatevershe does is for her own defence.   There is an eternalconflict between Indian andBritish interests.    It follows that their notions of defence would also differ.   TheBritish Government has notrust in India&apos;s political parties.   The Indian Army hasbeen maintained up till nowmainly to hold India insubjugation,   it has been completely segregated fromthe general population who can in no sense regard it as their own.   This policy ofmistrust still continues andis the reason why nationaldefence is not entrusted toIndia&apos;s elected representative-ives,   japan&apos;s ouarrel is notwith India. . Sir- is warringagainst the British Empire.

Con^^^Jjiesolu^ioja JLQo^M. i)participation in the war was a purely British act imposed uponthe Indian people without theconsent of their r3presentat-ives.   While India has noquarrel with the people of any country, she lias repeatedlydeclared her antipathy to Nazismand Fascism as to imperialism.If India were free she wouldhnve determined her own nolicyand might have kept&quot; out of thewar, though her sympathieswould, in any event, have beenwith the victims of aggression.If, however, circumstances had led her to join the war, she would have done so as a freecountry fighting for freedom,and her defence would have beanorganised on a popular basis with a national army under national control and. leadership,and with intimate contacts withthe people.   A free India wouldknow how to defend herself inthe event of any aggressorattacking her.   The presentIndian Army is in fact an off-shoot of the British army andhas been maintained till nowmainly to hold India in subject-ion.    It has been completelysegregated from the generalpopulation, who can in no senseregard it as their own.The essential differencebetween the imperialist and the popular conceptions of defence is demonstrated by the factthat while foreign armies areinvited to India for that defence, the vast man-power ofIndia herself is not utilised for the purpose.   India&apos;s past experience teaches her that itis harmful to her interest and dangerous to the cause of herfreedom to introduce foreignarmies in India.    It is significant and extraordinarythat India1s inexhaustible man-power should remain untapped,while India developes into abattleground between foreignarmies fighting on her soil oron her frontiers, and herdefence is not supposed to be a subject fit for popular control.India resents this treatment ofher people as chattels to be disposed of by foreignauthority.The/Original Draft (Contd 0..

If India werefreed her first step wouldprobably be to negotiate with Japan.   The Congressis of opinion that if theBritish withdrew from India.,India would be able todefend herself in the eventof Japanese or any aggressora ttacking Ind ia.The A.I.C.C. is there-fore of opinion that theBritish should withdraw from India,   The plea thatthey should remain in india for protecting the IndianPrinces is wholly untenable,It is additional proof oftheir determination to main-tain their hold over India .The Princes need have nofear from unarmed India.The question of major-ity and minority is acreation of the BritishGovernment and would disappear on their with-drawal.For all these reasons the Committee appeals to britain, for the sake of her own safety, for the sake ofIndia&apos;s safety and for thecause -of world peace to lotgsE her hold on India even if she does not give up allAsiatic and African possoss-ions.This Committee desires to assure the JapaneseGovernment and. people that india bears no enmity eithertowards Japan or towards anyother nation.   India onlydesires freedom from allalien domination,   But inthis fight for freedom theCommittee is of opinion that india while welcominguniversal sympathy does not stand in need of foreignmilitary aid.

The present crisis,as well as the experience ofthe negotiations with sir stafford Cripps, makes itimpossible for the Congress toconsider any schemes orproposals which retain, evenin a partial measure, british control and authority in Indie.Not only the Interests of Indiabut also Britain&apos;s sa f et y.and world peace and freedomdemand: that Britain mustabandon her hold on India.    Itis on the basis of independencealone that India can deal with britain or otherOriginal Draft (Contd.)have any designs on India.But if Japan attacks Indiaand Britain makes no response to its appeal the Committeewould expect all those wholook to Congress for guidance to offer complete non-violentnon-cooDeration to theJapanese forces and not renderany assistance to them.   Itis no part of the duty ofthose who are&quot;attacked torender any assistance to theattacker.   It is their duty to offer complete non-cooper-ation.It is not difficult tounderstand the simpleprinciple of non-violent non-cooperation : -The Committee repudiatesthe idea that- freedom can cometo India through interferenceor invasion by any foreignnation, whatever the profess-shmay be.takes place.Suchtake thenon-cooper -Government1.toofions of that nationincase an invasionit must be resistedresistance can onlyform of non-violentat ion as the Britihas prevented the organisationof national defence by thepeople in any other way.
