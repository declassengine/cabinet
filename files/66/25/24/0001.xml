(!^L^-^L-L!!!i^!!?!L2!^^ britannic majesty&apos;s government).TO BE KEj^j^l^^Jtis requested that special care may fae taken toensure the secrecy of this document.secret.W.P.(42)  244,3th June, 1942. copy N0JWAR CABINET.CENSORSHIP!Memorandum by the Minister of Information,Reference was recently made to two cases in which it was alleged that the Censorship had been at fault.      The firstcase was the failure of the B,30C0 to stop Lord Wedgwood&apos;broadcast to the United States,   &apos; The second was an alleged&apos;break&apos;  of news about the Russian negotiations,2,      Lord Wedgwood&apos;s broadcast was not, of course, arranged by the B,B,Co butbyau American broadcasting company,     Neverthe-less the censorship of the script was the duty of the Censor-ship unit which the B.B.C, maintains at Broadcasting House.There is no justification for the failure of the censorconcerned to refer the script of Lord Wedgwood&apos;s broadcast to higher authority0      He has been dismissed,5.     There has not been any very bad &quot;break&quot; of news in Londonregarding the Russian negotiations.     No English newspaperhas published a word about them.      The &quot;break&quot; to which reference was made came from Washington and thy cause of it has since been discovered to be the failure of the State Department toimpart any instr\ictions concerning the negotiations to the censorship authoritiesc      Since this was rectified there hasbeen no further leakage,4,      The item of news complained of was transmitted to London byReuters  and submitted to our own. censors here before distribution,in this countryp.     Some parts of it were deleted but others were allowed to pass.      Subsequently the deputy Chief Censoron duty thought that he had better report the whole message toone of the Foreign Office advisers, who considered, it necessaryto &quot;kill&quot; it even though it had already been passed on to the news tapes.      In consequence it received no publication in thiscountry,      I am not concerned to question the wisdom of theForeign Office in taking this action,      But if the censor hadpossessed a little more background knowledge of the situation bewould not have made the initial error.-.The moral of all this is that the Chief Censor should begiven sufficient information about important diplomatic develop-ments to enable him to instruct his officers properly.      Inpresent circumstances he frequently receives first news of thiskind not from the Foreign Office but from press correspondentsthemselves.      Some correspondents are regularly gettinginformation from t$*a foreign Embassies which is considered tobe too secret to irspetrt to.   the Chief Censor,     So long as this state of affairs continues * the censors cannot be blamedif sometimes through ignorance significant diplomatic newsis   allowed to leak out to
The difficulty cannot be solved by arranging   for thecensor to refer all s tories about political matters to theForeign Office news adviser as a matter of course.      Censor-ship by this double process would be wasteful and dilatory.It would cause endless conflicts with the Press, who havealready seen the censorship rules strained to breakingpoint to meet Foreign Office requirements.     Nor would sucha practice be consistent with the maintenance of the properresponsibility of the Censorship to interpret and apply the rules the Government has laid down for thorn.BcBi9th June,  1942
