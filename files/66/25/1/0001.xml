THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  May 1942.SECRET.W.P. (42) 221.May 25, 1942.WAR CABINET.THE CASE OF DEJAZMACH GTJGSA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Emperor of Ethiopia has asked that an Ethiopian traitor, namedDejazmach Gugsa, should be surrendered to him to stand his trial for havingdeserted to the Italians with a number of his followers during the Italo-Abyssinian war (1935-36).2. The facts of the desertion are that Dejazmach Gugsa was entrusted bythe Emperor with the command of a feudal force when the Italian invasion of ethiopia began in 1935. During the battle of Makalle, Dejazmach Gugsa, byprevious arrangement with the enemy, crossed over to the other side Mathdisastrous results to the Ethiopian forces. Thereafter he became a Quisling forthe Italians in the Abyssinian province of Tigre.3. In April 1941 the Emperor asked General Platt to arrest DejazmachGugsa, who was then in Asmara, and to surrender him for trial. In november last the Emperor was informed by the Chief Political Officer to the Commander -in-Chief that His Majesty&apos;s Government were unable to accede to the Emperor&apos;request because (1) Dejazmach Gugsa had &quot; virtually sought British protection &quot; ;and (2) he must be regarded as a political offender, and such surrender would&quot; cause grave dissatisfaction in the minds of the British public.&quot;4. It was then decided that Dejazmach Gugsa should be interned at theexpense of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Seychelles and arrangements to thisend were made; but, before he had been removed from Asmara, the Emperor madea formal request to His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Addis Ababa that the question should be reconsidered and that the traitor should be handed over to him. HisMajesty gave Mr. Howe assurances that a fair trial would be accorded him.5. Mr. Howe supported the Emperor&apos;s request and reported that ourappearance of shielding this traitor was likely to do harm to our relations withEthiopia. The matter was accordingly re-examined by my Department, and itwas ascertained that the decision not to hand over Gugsa was made by the previousMinister of State. On the other hand, I am advised that, while there may be legal difficulties in the way of surrendering Gugsa since he is now in British territory,the validity of the grounds on which the previous decision was taken is doubtful.It seems to me that the case of Gugsa is similar to that of many of the Quislingsin Europe, whom, if they fall into our hands, we shall certainly surrender to theAllied Government concerned. I have, therefore, put the matter before thepresent Minister of State, and, if he concurs in my view, I propose to ask theSecretary of State for the Colonies to hand over Gugsa, who, in the meantime,has been sent from Asmara to Uganda on his way to the Seychelles, to theEmperor, if this is legally possible, subject to the receipt of assurances from HisMajesty (1) that Gugsa will be properly tried, and (2) that, if sentenced to death,he will be executed in a civilised manner.A.
