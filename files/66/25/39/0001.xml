THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government most SECRET.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.EXTRACTS FROM CORRESPONDENCE.(1) Extract from telegram from Prime Minister to President Roosevelt,dated the 25th July, 1941 :-&quot; But plans ought also to be made for coming to the aid of the conqueredpopulations by landing armies of liberation when opportunity is ripe. Forthis purpose it will be necessary not only to have great numbers of tanks,but also of vessels capable of carrying them and landing them direct on tobeaches. It ought not to be difficult for you to make the necessary adaptationin some of the vast numbers of merchant vessels you are building so as to fit them for Tank-landing fast ships.&quot;(2) Minute from Prime Minister to First Sea Lord, dated the 8th September,1941 :-&quot; My idea was not that the President should build Winettes as such,apart from any already arranged for, but that out of the great number ofmerchant vessels being constructed in the United States for 1942 he should fitout a certain number with brows and side-ports to enable Tanks to be landedfrom them on beaches, or into Tank-landing craft which would take themto the beaches.Please help me to explain this point to him, showing what kind ofalteration would be required in the American merchant ships now projected.&quot;(3) Note by First Sea Lord, dated the 25th September, in reply to (2) : &quot;Modification to certain American Merchant Ships for Tank Landing.The tanks and / or motor vehicles would be carried on the 2nd deck, which-would require to be lowered and possibly stiffened locally.An opening approximately 40&apos; long and 10&apos; 6&quot; high would be cut inthe shell plating amidships on each side for vehicles to pass through, eitherwhen being taken on board or when being disembarked. This opening wouldbe fitted with a hinged flap door which when open would, form a platform.Two brows about 80&apos; long by 13&apos; wide, one each side, would be carried by the ship when tank operations are envisaged and would be stowed againstthe ship&apos;s side forward of the openings during passage to and from the scene of operations. The brows would be long enough to enable tanks toland on the beach if the vessels were aground or to land into T.L.Cs. should it be desired to keep the vessel afloat.The biggest alteration is lowering the 2nd deck so that the heightbetween this and the upper deck gives sufficient head room for the vehicles.A minimum head room of 10&apos; 6&quot; &quot;all fore and aft would be required, a passage-way at least 13&apos; wide being provided on one side of the machinerycasing. It is not possible to say with our present knowledge whether theexisting machinery layout would permit the lowering of the 2nd deck inthis area.[23963a]
Openings 13ft. wide and 10ft. 6 in. high would be necessary in the maintransverse tween deck bulkheads to allow vehicles a clear passage fore andaft. These openings would have to be closed when the ship is used as a cargo carrier in order to provide the requisite transverse strength and water-tight sub-division.Although the openings in the side plating would be made watertight forthe ship&apos;s ordinary service as a cargo carrier by means of the hinged steeldoor, these doors would not contribute to the longitudinal strength of theship. The scantlings of the shell plating and bulwarks around the openingswould be increased to compensate for the loss in strength due to the cuttingof these large ports.The above proposals would enable the ship to carry and land up to40-ton tanks, probably 25 in number, and up to 3-ton army lorries; stillheavier tanks could be dealt with by shoring the brow. The general schemeis illustrated on attached print.It is assumed that these ships would be used after.the first operation of landing and seizing the foreshore and country immediately surrounding, thatis, the vessels would be Tank-landing Ships not Tank Assault Ships. Acertain amount of accommodation would have to be provided for tank crewsand maintenance staff, and it would be necessary to devise some arrangement for ventilating the tank stowage space during the landing operation. Thefitting of ouch accommodation and ventilation would involve taking the ships in hand a fair time before they could be used for tank carrying.&quot;(4) Extract from letter from Prime Minister to President RoOsevelt, datedthe 20th October, 1941. Document (3) was enclosed with this letter, which was sent by hand of Mr. Attlee, then Lord Privy Seal :i &apos;&quot; 15. In my telegram of the 25th July ,1941, which I sent you before our Atlantic meeting, I spoke of the long-term project for 1943 of the simultaneous landing of, say, 15,000 tanks from hundreds of specially-fittedocean-going ships on the beaches of three or four countries ripe for revolt.I suggested&quot; that the necessary alterations could easily be made at this stage to a proportion of your merchant ships now building on so vast a scale.I now send you the drawings prepared by the Admiralty, which illustrate the kind of treatment the vessels would require. You will see that it isestimated only to add about  50,000 to their cost, and I suppose a proportionate delay. It seems to me that not less than 200 ships should bethus fitted. There is sufficient time, as we cannot think of such a plan before1943. But the essential counterpaA i oi -he Tank programme you have nowembarked upon, is the power to transport them across&apos;the oceans and landthem upon unfortified beaches along the immense coast-line Hitler is committed to defend. I trust therefore, Mr. President, that this willcommend itself to you.&quot;(5) Note by Mr. Attlee on his conversation with President Roosevelt on theabove (November 1941) : &quot; 2. Adaptation of merchant ships for tank landing. President likedthe idea but would not introduce it on any ships that, were 25 per cent, ormore complete as it would lead to delay. These ships, take about three months to build.......&quot;
