0. (p       )83DOCUMENT IS^THE^PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)*&apos;--------------------- - -secret.P. (42)  265 A0PY not  ; .,j2QTH JUNE,   1942 \JWAR cabinet coal WAGESEFFECT OF RECENT AWARD ON STABILIZATION policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The Board of Investigation under Lord Greene has recommended a further flat rate war addition of 2/6 a shiftfor adult workers, with lesser amounts for juveniles;    aminimum wage of 83/- a week for adult underground workers and78/- for surface workers;    an output bonus related to theoutput of each pit;    with a proviso to safeguard the presentpercentage additions to wages in the prosperous areas.    TheLord President7s Committee decided to accept these recommenda-tions (subject to some further consideration by the Board ofthe form of outpub bonus which they suggested) and decidedalso that the increased cost should be provided by an increasein pit-head prices  (L.P,(42) 38th Meeting).2e The increase in the cost of domestic coal and,gas(assuming that it may be necessary to authorise an increasein gas prices in some areas)  is estimated to produce a rise of about one point in the cost of living index number.      Theeffects on the largest industrial users may broadly beanticipated to be:Railways.    The extra cost  ( 2 to  3 m.) will fall on theGovernment share of the proceedscIron and Steel.      The extra cost ( 3 to  4 m.),  inconjunct ion wiTHFTc abstain other increased costs, will make acase for some increase in price,  95% of which will fall onthe Government as the principal customersPublic Utilitieso      The average increase in cost of gas isestimated at&quot;&quot;0old0 &quot;per therm,,      Some undertakings will have acase for an increase in price.      The increase per unit ofelectricity is more difficult to estimate^     Most undertakingsare believed to be in a position to carry some increase In cost.Cement and Bricksr      In general no increase in price seems likely to &quot;be&quot; neededo3. The total actual price increase will be different for different kinds of coal;    it is proposed to temper the windas much as possible to the domestic consumer.      An increaseof 2/3 per ton (the amount required for the wage bill) isabout l^d. per cwt. which is about the average weekly consumption of a small household.

I l, I regard the decision to pass on the cost to theIconsumer, instead of subsidising, as entirely consistent withthe wages and prices stabilisation policy.I ,     XI 5.    (a) The White Paper last year (Cmd.  6294) expresslyI contemplated that there might be further increases in wagesI m individual industries in the kind of circumstances v/hichI Lord Greene!s Board have found to exist in the coal industry.(b) The direct effect on the cost of living index numberkis not likely to be more than one point.      The &quot;ceiling&quot;indicated in the White Paper is a figure of about 201 or aLittle more.      The latest published figure is 199.      Evenif the effects of eoal prices were to raise the index numberfor a time above 201,  I should not regard that as implyingby any means that the policy had failed.      I have made itclear that variations are to be expected,  and that I couldnot undertake that in no single month or quarter the indexwould not exceed a particular figure.      It will be quite possible to adjust the prices of other factors by Exchequerassistance,  and if signs of a greater movement develop, Ishould propose to discuss with the Minister of Pood thequestion of a further subsidy of some suitable food.      I havealready agreed with him to hold the price of potatoes duringthe Summer and more could if necessary be done.      I acceptthe point v/hich has been made that the general index numberis not the sole criterion and that the position of the poorest consumer of coal must be borne in mind;    a fall Inthe price of clothing, while it would lower the Index number,might not compensate him for a rise in the price of coal.But I would deprecate any statement now that the increase in coal price is to be compensated by a further subsidy to food.(Intld, )    K.W.Treasury Chambers,  S.W.l8
