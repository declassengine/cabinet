NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. There have been no important developments in the naval situation.Shipping losses reported have been lighter than of late.Home and Northern Waters.2. On the night of the 18th/19th H.M. Destroyer Albrighton and twoS.G.Bs. (steam gunboats) attacked two escorted merchant vessels near Havre.One ship was torpedoed and the other hit by gun fire. One S.G.B. was lost. Inother operations by light craft in the Channel an enemy patrol vessel was set on fire off Boulogne during the night of the 20th/21st and six E-boats were attacked with unknown results near Cape Gris-Nez on the night of the 21st/22nd.On the 24th, H.M. Minesweeper Gossamer was sunk by bombs in the KolaInlet.Mediterranean.3. H.M. Submarine Taku torpedoed and probably sank a 7,000-ton shipN.W. of Benghazi on the 20th, and the Greek Submarines Papanicolos and Tritonsank nine caiques during their patrol in the ^aegean.Ships in Tobruk were sailed by midnight of the 20th under shell fire from enemy tanks, but a number of small craft and landing craft were lost, details ofwhich are given in Appendix V.During the week approximately 40,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or damaged by our aircraft.  Details are given under Air Situation.About 9,000 tons of French shipping under escort have passed eastboundthrough the Straits of Gibraltar.East Indies.4. H.M. Submarine Trusty sank an 18,000-ton ship on the night of the3rd/4th in the Malacca Strait.Anti-Submarine Operations.5. During the week there have been 20 attacks on U-boats, of which seven wereby surface craft and 13 by aircraft. Of these it has been reported from Trinidadthat a promising attack was made by H.M. Corvette Lavender, but no details havebeen received. A United States aircraft claimed two hits in an attack in theGulf of Mexico, and a U-boat was probably damaged by our aircraft in the bay of Biscay. Of the remainder, 12 attacks were made in the West Atlantic and caribbean area, three in the Bay of Biscay, one in the Mediterranean and one inNorthern Waters.Enemy Intelligence.German.6. Air reconnaissance of Kiel on the 23rd June showed the Prinz Eugen indry dock with new stern now in position.Italian.7. It has been confirmed that a battleship of the Littorio Class was damaged by a torpedo on the occasion of the passage of the Malta convoys on the 15th June.It is not considered, however, that the damage is severe.Only one ship of 8/9,000 tons has reached Tripoli in the past week. Thisarrival brings the total tonnage reaching that port from Italy during June to37,000 tons.
Japanese. ,8. As the result of further information received from the U.S. navy department, the estimate of Japanese aircraft carrier strength at present is asfollows : aircraft in commission  carried.Zuikaku (16,000 tons)      .........Ryujo (7,100 tons).........Hosho (7,470 tons)............2 converted merchant ships of 27,000 tons each1 converted merchant ship of 16,500 tons1 ex-oiler of 12,000 tons    .........Under repair Shokaku (25,000 tons)      .........45302060? each42?42?60Sunk At Midway: 4 aircraft carriers (one of 28,000 tons, one of 26,900 tons,two of 10,050 tons each).In the Coral Sea: 1 carrier (an ex-oiler of 12,000 tons).Survivors picked up from the Japanese cruiser Mikuma have stated that the cruisers Mikuma and Mogami (6-inch, 8,500 tons) were sunk by bombs on the6th June in the Midway area.U-Boats.9. During the week there has been no change in the disposition of U-boats.The number of German U-boats in service is now estimated to be : 270 of 500 tons and over.50 of under 500 tons.The number under construction and fitting out is estimated at 271.Of these 5 are of 1,600 tons.17   ,,    .. 1,000    ,,52   ,, 750    ,,191   ,, 500^  ,,6   ,,   unclassified.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending midnight 21st/22nd, 1,116 ships, including291 Allied and 22 neutral, have been convoyed. One anti-aircraft ship,49 destroyers (including three United States destroyers) and 74 sloops, cuttersand corvettes were employed on escort duty.Imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending20th June totalled 774,000 tons compared with 438,000 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 631,400 tons for the past ten weeks. Of the week&apos;imports 181,000 tons were oil of various grades.Imports into the United Kingdom during the month of May totalled2,245,500 tons, including 31,200 tons from Eire. Imports under the Ministry ofFood totalled 1,190,000 tons, under the Ministry of Supply 988,900 tons and underthe Board of Trade 66,600 tons.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.11. During the period ten ships are reported to have been attacked by -boats; of these, five are known to have sunk. Six attacks took place in the carribbean and adjacent waters, two off the U.S.A. western seaboard and two offthe coast of California.. One ship was mined off Key West and one ship and asmall craft were mined and sunk in Home Waters off the South Coast.[24002J b
British Minelaying.12. Mines have been laid by surface craft in the East Coast Barrier and offthe Butt of Lewis. Minelaying by aircraft has continued on a large scale, mostlyoff the German North Sea coast, but also in the Bay of Biscay area.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.13. It is probable that no mines were laid by enemy aircraft during theweek. Mines were laid by E-boats off Beachy Head and Dungeness. Twenty-ninemagnetic and nine acoustic mines have been destroyed, chiefly off the South and east coasts.  The mine totals are 2,282 magnetic, 1,296 acoustic and 1.278 moored.Foreign Waters.Since the mining of three ships in the entrance to Chesapeake Bay referredto in last week&apos;s report, mines have been reported off Delaware andMassachusetts Bay.Enemy Merchant Shipping.14. The Danish Orion (4,000 tons) is reported to have been torpedoed offGotland in the Baltic on the 20th June, and the Swedish Ada Gorthon(2,399 tons) off Oland Island inside Swedish territorial waters on the 22nd whilecarrying a cargo of iron ore to Germany. The Roumanian Sulina (3,495 tons) isreported to have been torpedoed and sunk off Odessa on 27th May.MILITARY SITUATION.Libya.18^ June.15. The German advance continued in two main thrusts. The first wasalong the Trigh Capuzzo and the second along the track El Adem-Sheferzen.The first column halted during the morning south of Gambut. By dusk the limit of the enemy advance was 30 miles west of Sollum and our armoured car patrols were active on a line roughly from 30 miles west of Bardia to Gabr Saleh. the positions at Acroma were still holding out. The destruction of Bardia was completed.l%th June.16. We evacuated Acroma. Enemy forces moved up to dig in on the lineEl Adem-Acroma. No further advance was made towards the frontier, and theenemy appeared to be preparing to attack Tobruk from the south-east.201h June.17. The attack on Tobruk commenced during the early morning. A heavyair bombardment was followed by an infantry attack, which succeeded in making an initial breach in the south-east face of the perimeter. Enemy tanks andlorried infantry passed through this gap and were brought to battle during the afternoon. We lost very heavily in tanks and, as a result, the situation deteriorated rapidly. During the night the Force Commander asked, and wasgiven, permission to try and fight his way out. He proposed to make a detourvia Acroma and Bir Hacheim to Maddalena. General Auchinleck doubted whether such an attempt would succeed, and nothing has been heard of it since.Small numbers of the garrison have reached Egypt but the majority remainedand fought to the end. Our mobile forces operated offensively up to El Ademagainst stiffening opposition.21st June.18. At 0745 wireless communication with Tobruk ceased. Small partiesescaped by sea to Alexandria. Enemy movement after the fall of Tobruk was generally eastwards; by the next day his units were in contact with ourSollum positions and were also in some force in the Bardia-Capuzzo area.
22nd June.19. Enemy movement continued towards the frontier. Our mobile columnsoffered offensive resistance whenever opportunity occurred.23rd June.20. During the night 22nd/23rd and on the following day, the regroupingand reorganisation of our forces continued. No serious enemy pressure was broughtto bear against our defended positions in the Sollum area, but small parties of enemy were engaged during the day at several points. The main enemy activity was in the area Sidi Omar-Libyan Sheferzen. Battle groups of an armoured division were able to keep the enemy generally to the west of the frontier wire.A considerable body of enemy M.T. was to the north of the Trigh El Abd, about20 miles to the west of Sidi Omar. This force appeared to remain stationaryall day until about 1720, when some 1,500 vehicles were reported to be on the move in a south-easterly direction.24th June.21.   At 0700 the enemy were reported moving eastwards in three columns :  (a) 2,000 M.T. south-south-east of Sheferzen, with a detached column ofabout 200 M.T. and 50-60 A.F.Vs. in the area 10 miles east-south-east of Sheferzen, were moving north-westwards in the direction of half ay a.(6) 2,000 M.T. were reported at a point 15 miles south-east of Sheferzen.(c) A further 1,000 M.T. were reported to be in the neighbourhood ofMaddalena.Some enemy armoured cars had also advanced along the coast road west ofBuq Buq.Our mobile battle units had withdrawn into Egypt during the previous night.At nightfall advanced enemy units were within 50 miles of Matruh. The enemymain body, closely following up their advanced troops, was engaged by one of ourmobile units and a successful delaying action was fought around Mischeifa.Russo-German Campaign.[An outline map showing operations in Russia is included in this resume as an inset.]Northern Sector.22. The Russians have been successful in what are probably local attacks onthe River Volkhov south-east of Leningrad.Southern Sector. s23. North-east of Kharkov the Germans have extended their bridgeheadacross the River Donets. The Russians admit to having retired to new positions and the German salient has probably cut off most of the railway Volchansk-Kupyansk.Crimea.24. The situation in Sevastopol was reported on the 21st to be critical.On 19th the German forces were within five miles of the centre of the city inthe south; in the north they were rapidly approaching the northern shore ofSevernaya Bay, on the southern shore of which Sevastopol stands. The northernshore is now entirely in German hands.Comment.25. The Germans have established a salient east of Kharkov, and there isnow&apos; a comparative lull in this sector. The extension of German offensive operations to other parts of the southern front has undoubtedly been held up bythe prolonged Russian resistance at Sevastopol. The elimination of - Sevastopolas a Russian naval base also appears essential to the staging of any combined operation against the Black Sea coast of Caucasia.[24002] b 2
India.A ssam Frontier and Burma.26. There has been no contact with the enemy. Small bodies have beenreported on the Chindwin as far north as Tamanthi, about 50 miles north-east of Homalin.Intelligence.South-West Pacific.27. The following United States formations have arrived in the pacific area : (a) A Division less two infantry regiments and Headquarters of a MarineDivision and one Marine regiment have arrived in New Zealand.(b) One infantry regiment has arrived in Fiji.Far Eust.28. No troop movements of particular significance have been reported during the past week, but the general slowing down of Japanese activity in central China is consistent with reports that troops are to be withdrawn fromthat area for transfer to Manchuria.North-East India.29. With General Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s approval, further Chinese forces aremaking their way into India, probably via Ledo. Supplies have been dropped tothem by the U.S.A. Air Force.AIR SITUATION.General.30. Bombing attacks on targets in Germany and Occupied Territory were ona moderate scale.In Libya, our aircraft were heavily engaged in supporting our land forces.Successful attacks were made on enemy convoys in the Mediterranean,United Kingdom.31.   Fighter Command flew 864 defensive sorties by day and 382 by night.In daylight, land reconnaissances over the Southern Counties were on asubstantial scale and single-engined fighters carried out several minoroperations over this country. Two enemy aircraft were shot down, and after acombat with Spitfires one F.W. 190 landed intact on Pembrey aerodrome.At night, two attacks were made by approximately 50 enemy aircraft. Thefirst concentrated against Southampton, and the other was scattered over areasof the Midlands and Eastern Counties. Our night fighters shot down eight enemy bombers.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.32. Fighter and Bomber Command despatched 1,082 and 59 sorties respectively compared with 254 and 4 last week.Five bombing operations were carried out by a total of 54 Bostons, escorted by 35 squadrons of Spitfires. Three attacks were made on Dunkirk docks, one on the Havre Power House and, one on Morlaix aerodrome. At Dunkirk, hits were scored on dock buildings, on railway lines and on a 4,000 ton merchant vessel.At Havre, most of the bombs fell to the north-west of the power house and neara railway station, and at Morlaix, bombs fell on aerodrome buildings.Small-scale attacks were made on Langeoog, Wilhelmshaven and Emden, andon an aerodrome near Furnes.
Fighter sweeps, involving 42 squadrons of Spitfires and two squadrons ofTyphoons, were flown over Northern France and Belgium. This was the first occasion on which Typhoons operated.In these operations, our fighters destroyed 11 fighters, probably destroyed two and damaged nine.  We lost 12, Spitfires.Night.33. Bomber Command, despatched 661 aircraft against lamd targetscompared with 143 last week. Nearly 1,000 tons of H.E. and incendiary bombs were dropped.About nine hundred tons were dropped on Emden, which was attacked on three nights. The target was obscured, by cloud and ground haze on two nights,but on the third night visibility was good. Photographs show that among thebuildings destroyed or badly damaged were the main offices of the Hamburg-America Line, the outer harbour station, several large warehouses, and the mainportion of Cassen&apos;s shipyard.Fifty tons were dropped on Osnabruck, where bombs were seen to burst inthe town and on railway buildings.Other targets included the docks at St. Nazaire, which were bombed on two nights, and aerodromes in Northern France and Holland.Thirteen aircraft dropped propaganda leaflets on towns in Northern France,Belgium, Holland and North-West Germany.Fighter Command despatched 50 aircraft to attack aerodromes and railway centres in Occupied Territory. Four enemy aircraft were destroyed and fourwere damaged over the aerodromes.We lost 24 bombers in these night operations.Coastal Operations.34. Coastal Command flew 520 sorties, 59 of which were engaged in convoy escourt.   Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Command involved 1,168 sorties.A Hudson of Coastal Command attacked and damaged a 1,500-ton merchant vessel off Texel. A second Hudson claimed near misses on a 500/600-ton merchant vessel off Den Helder. Other Hudsons bombed a merchant vessel off Texel and a convoy consisting of two large merchant vessels and four small vessels off Borkum,but results were not observed.Hurricane bombers and Spitfires of Fighter Command attacked shipping offthe French and Belgian coasts. Five small boats were probably sunk; three armedmine-sweepers, a trawler and a coastal vessel were damaged. A merchant vesseland a flak ship were also attacked, but results were not observed.One hundred and fifty-one aircraft of Bomber Command laid 361 sea-mines in enemy waters.   One Hampden is missing.Mediterranean.Egypt and Libya.35. Light bombers and fighter bombers concentrated their attacks on enemy M.T. columns and supply vehicles; much damage was done at El Gazalaand Tobruk, and later, in the Sidi Aziez and Sheferzen areas and on the Tobruk-Bardia road. Daylight raids were also carried out on enemy aerodromes atEl Tmimi and El Gazala.Fighters flew strong offensive patrols over the battle area and on theprotection of shipping, but enemy opposition was on a small scale and fewdecisive combats resulted.At night, Wellingtons and Liberators of the TJ.S.A. Army Corps bombedshipping and the harbour installations at Benghazi, and aerodromes at El Tmimiand El Gazaia; some large fires were reported and aircraft on the ground were hit. On the night 24th/25th June over 80 bombers attacked Benghazi. Sea-mines were laid at Benghazi and Tobruk.On the morning of the 17th enemy fighter activity was considerable over the battle area and our forward landing grounds. This activity ceased after an effective,surprise attack on the enemy fighter base at El Gazala by Kittyhawkscarrying bombs.
, On the following three days the enemy undertook only small-scale operations,apparently in preparation for the peak effort against Tobruk on the 21st June&apos;It is estimated that the number of sorties made on that day was greatly in excessof the number made on any one day since the attack was launched.Enemy bombers carried out a series of night attacks against our communi-cations, forward landing grounds and M.T. in the Fort Capuzzo, Sollum andSidi Barrani areas.   These raids caused very little damage.Crete and Dodecanese.36. Small-scale bombing attacks were made on aerodromes in Crete andRhodes.Malta.37. In daylight, a few bombers and small formations of enemy fightersoperated over the Island with the object of keeping our fighters in the air. Sixenemy fighters were shot down and four others were damaged. . Two Spitfireswere destroyed, but the pilot of one is safe.Enemy attacks at night increased in intensity and on each of three nightsbetween 20-30 aircraft were employed, mainly against Luqa aerodrome. three off our aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and seven enemy bombers were shot down.Sea Communications.38. On the 21st June eight Beauforts, escorted by six Beaufighters, were despatched from Malta to attack an enemy convoy 60 miles south of Cape Bon.Two merchant vessels of about 8,000 tons and one escort vessel were hit with torpedoes and one of the merchant vessels is believed to have sunk. Three enemy aircraft escorting the convoy were shot down, and three Beauforts are missing.Two days later another convoy was attacked 51 miles east of CapeSpartivento. Two vessels of 7,000 tons and a.destroyer were hit with torpedoes.The convoy was left stationary and one vessel was down by the stern. TwoBeauforts were shot down by A.A. fire and another crashed on landing.Two other large merchant vessels were hit by Wellingtons at night. one ship was set on fire.Russia.39. Murmansk was heavily raided on the 18th, and it is estimated thatone-third of the town is in ruins. There were no casualties to H.M. ships ormerchant shipping, but work in the docks has practically ceased.No information has been received about air operations in other parts of theRussian front.Burma.40. The harbour and aerodrome at Akyab were attacked several times by wellingtons and Blenheims.  Wharves and harbour buildings were hit.Blenheims and Mohawks bombed military targets at Homalin and Kalewa,and aerodromes at Magwe and Myitkyina, where buildings and aircraft were damaged.Supplies were dropped at Shinbwiyang, Port Hertz and Taro by allied aircraft.Pacific Zone.41.

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past wreek :-Germany.Cologne.Following the raid of 30th/31st May, it is reported that the local authorities were completely unable to cope with the situation. Emergency feeding, first aid,and evacuation measures broke down and some people had to walk over 30 miles tofind lodging. S.A. and S.S. officials deserted the city under the pretext of seekingemergency accommodation in the surrounding country for the people renderedhomeless by the raid.The raids are said to have placed heavy burdens on the German war supply-organisation, and to have caused serious dislocation in the supplies of Ruhr coal and coke for German industry and railway purposes.Emden.Photographs taken on 21st June show the following damage resulting fromthe attack of the 19th : (a) East side of the Binnen Hafen: In the Government Yard two sheds havebeen destroyed and one damaged, and on the dockside and in theIndustrie Hafen several others have been damaged by fire and blast.In addition there is a direct hit on the railway line leading to theNordseewerke.(b) West side of the Binnen Hafen:  Three small buildings at Nesserlandhave been severely damaged by fire, and there is a direct hit on theVerbindungsweg, cutting the road.(c) Town area: At the Roten Siel a large 3-bay industrial building and two other buildings have been gutted and a warehouse in Toft market hashas been partially burnt out. In addition, a small area in the centre of the town has been devastated by fire, and there is damage to residential and commercial property in other parts of the town.Osnabruck.Photographs taken on 20th June show the following damage as a result ofthe attack of the 19th : Around Grosse Str., Hernfeichs Str., Stuben Str. and Schweden Str. an areaof about 9 acres has been devastated by fires, which were seen to be still burningon the day after the attack.Occupied Territory.General.The &quot; hunt &quot; for French railway engines recently undertaken by the R.A.F.is described as very effective. Some measure of its success can be gauged fromthe fact that within a short space of time the Region Nord have had 50 of theirengines (of which they are in dire need) put out of action for a lengthy period.Sea Mining.One of Germany&apos;s latest minesweepers of 1,200 tons fitted with anti-magnetic mine gear was mined and sank on 11th May off Trelleborg about 2 milesout of territorial waters.
