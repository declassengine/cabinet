MILK POLICY(Paragraphs i to   6 inclusive refer to England and Wales only.)(Paragraphs 7 to 13 inclusive refer to England,  Wales and Scotland.)THE MARKETING OF MILK.1. It is the policy of the Government to maintain and if possible increasethe production of milk, and to stimulate consumption by consumers who need it most, particularly children and mothers.2. In pursuance of this policy milk producers have been guaranteed by theGovernment a return for all the milk they offer for sale which is independent of the price realised for it whether sold for liquid consumption or for manu-facture. This guarantee has relieved the Milk Marketing Board of it;obligation to organise the marketing and sale of milk to the best advantageof producers.3. Mainly because of the establishment of the National Milk Scheme, which provides cheap or free milk for children and expectant mothers, the con-sumption of milk in the liquid form has greatly increased. In the winter months the demand now exceeds the supply. This disequilibrium is more marked in some areas than others.4. Milk is a vital part of the nation&apos;s food supply, and the Government!have accordingly undertaken the responsibility for the direction of supplies Iso as to ensure that priority demands are met and the balance available is fequitably distributed.5. The present system, under which individual producers and buyers enter!into contracts for the sale and purchase of milk is ill suited to the changed conditions. Milk sold&apos; for delivery in one district may be needed to meet :requirements in another, and this has involved widespread redirection of milkfrom one part of the country to another and from one purchaser to another.It has also involved a change in the functions of distributors. The distributormay now only supplyhis registered customers, and his total sales for domestic consumption may not exceed the quantity needed to provide the various classes of priority and non-priority consumers registered with him with the allowances laid down for them by the Minister of Food.6. Some modification of the existing marketing arrangements is clearlynecessary to avoid waste of effort and to prevent breakdowns in supply. Afterconsultation with representatives of producers and buyers the Governmenthave decided to make the following changes:  (a) Method of Purchase. All contracts between milk producers andpurchasers of milk will be terminated on 30th September, 1942. from 1st October, 1942, the Milk Marketing Board will become the sole pur-chaser of milk from producers except that used by producer-retailers fortheir own businesses. The Minister of Food will purchase the milk fromthe Milk Marketing Board and will simultaneously sell it to distributorsand manufacturers at destinations determined by him:(b) Purchase Price. The Minister of Food will pay prescribed prices to the Milk Marketing Board for all milk purchased each month and itwill be for the Board to determine on what basis the total sum paid shallbe distributed amongst individual producers (i.e., whether as a uniformprice, or a price subject to regional or other area variations).(c) Quality. The price paid by the Milk Marketing Board to the producer and- by the Minister of Food to the Milk MarketingBoard will vary according to the quality of the  milk as revealed
by a test of the milk itself. The standards of quality and thetesting arrangements will be prescribed and the scheme will be administered by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries with theassistance of an Advisory Committee on which the interested Depart-ments, producers and distributors will be represented. The scheme will apply to all milk sold by producers. Milk will be classified according tothe testing results into &quot; Market &quot;, &quot; Salvage &quot; and &quot; Rejected &quot;. Theobject of the scheme is primarily to prevent milk of poor keeping qualitypassing into bulked supplies or reaching the liquid market direct. Thescheme will not replace the existing standards of &quot; T.T.&quot; or&quot; Accredited &quot;; thus, milk which is not &quot; T.T.&quot;, &quot; Accredited &quot; or&quot; Market &quot;, but is suitable for manufacture will be paid for at a&quot; Salvage &quot; price, to be determined by the Minister of Food in consulta-tion with the Milk Marketing Board. Milk not fit for manufacture willbe rejected and no price will be paid for it. Investigations will be made into the causes of milk not reaching &quot; Market &quot; standard, and steps willbe taken to remedy matters.(d) Transport Charges. The producer will be relieved of the liability for delivering his milk to the consuming centre, and his responsibilitywill end on delivery at the collecting depot or other destination deter-mined by the Minister of Food. As there will be a saving in transport costs to producers as a whole an appropriate deduction will be made fromthe milk price payable by the Minister to the Board.(e) Rationalisation of Transport. Measures will be taken to rationalisethe collection and transport of milk to eliminate overlapping collectionsand cross hauls.(f) Depots. All depots required for the collection and distribution of milk will be operated under the direction of the Minister of Food on abasis to be agreed with the proprietors. All rebates previously obtained by depot proprietors or distributors from railway companies and otherhauliers will accrue to the Minister of Food. Milk which passes throughdepots will, so far as possible, be pasteurised before it leaves the depot orbe brine-cooled and delivered to a wholesaler or retailer who can pasteur-ise the milk before supplying it to the public.(g) Selling Price. The Minister of Food will sell all milk, whether forliquid consumption or manufacture, at uniform prices, instead of, as atpresent, at varying prices for different uses. Any consequential adjust-ment will be made in the price paid by the Minister to manufacturers forthe finished product.Wholesalers will be charged the same price whether the milk is delivereddirect from the producer or from a depot. The wholesaler&apos;^ remunera-tion will be determined on the basis of a costings investigation, covering the costs of breaking bulk or other wholesaling services. Retailers willpurchase on a uniform basis (whether the milk is delivered direct fromthe producer or from a depot). The Minister of Food will retain complete control of the distribution of milk and be able to direct it to any part ofthe country where it is required.RETAIL DISTRIBUTION.7- The national demand for man-power has already resulted in an appreci- &apos;Ible reduction in the number of dairymen.   From ah enquiry, covering 172separate districts, conducted in March, 1942, by the dairy industry itself it
was estimated that no. less than 1,387 separate retailers have joined up w;tnother organisations since the outbreak of the war, as compared with only 2-newcomers into the trade in the same areas.8. This spontaneous local movement towards rationalisation iii different parts of the country is irregular and slow and may press unduly on smallfirms. The Government realises that a plan for the rationalising of retailmilk deliveries is needed. The Minister of Food will therefore require alldairymen serving any urban locality which comprises a population of over]10,000 to form a war-time association for the distribution of milk in thatlocality, with strict regard to the economical use of transport and man-powerSchemes for these associations must be presented for approval to the Ministerwithin three months of the 1st of June.9. The Minister will require all such schemes to contain provision that theindividual firms comprising the associations shall be allocated a share of tktrade of the district proportionate to that which they were enjoying before theassociation was established; and, further, that if firms are no longer able orwilling to conduct business to this extent, then the association shall recom-pense them for the trade that is done on their behalf by other members ofthe association. The Ministry will advise and assist dairymen in the woricinsout of these schemes on the lines of agreement already reached with the trade organisations.10. It will be agreed between the parties concerned in these rationalisationschemes that the schemes will be for the period of the war only.11. On condition that local rationalisation schemes are prepared, theMinister of Food will issue instructions that consumers in the localities con-cerned shall no longer have the right to transfer their purchases of milk toanother dairyman; their registrations will be &quot; frozen &quot; with their exist in;dairymen.12. Where a substantial majority of the dairymen in an area promote alocal rationalisation scheme and the Minister of Food is satisfied that such 2scheme is desirable, the Minister will take steps to compel the minority tocome within the scheme so that it can operate universally over the are;concerned.13. Where the distributors themselves fail to produce a scheme the Ministerof Food will intervene. If no scheme is prepared and submitted to the Ministerwithin the prescribed time he will himself introduce and enforce a schemeafter considering local circumstances.2.6th May, 1942.(19855) wt.     -2, 80   5/43   D.L.
