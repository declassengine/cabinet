YJune 22, 1942.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.TREATMENT OF WAR CRIMINALS.Minute by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues a memorandum prepared at my request by theLaw Officers of the Crown, setting out the issues which require consideration in deciding the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the treatment ofwar criminals after the war.2. It will be recalled that the Prime Minister issued a statement on the25th October last with particular reference to the shooting of hostages in France,laying down that &apos;&apos; retribution for these crimes must henceforward takes its placeamong the major purposes of the war.&quot; The attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Govern -ment has been based upon this statement, to which reference was made by therepresentatives of the Allied Governments now established in London in theresolution passed at the meeting at St. James&apos;s Palace on the 13th January last.His Majesty&apos;s Government and the major Allied Governments, although repre-sented by observers, did not participate in this resolution. The attitude of theUnited States Government was laid down by President Roosevelt on the25th October in a statement similar to that issued by the Prime Minister. TheSoviet Government have circulated three notes condemning German atrocities inthe Soviet Union, in the most important of which, dated the 6th January,M. Molotov stated that &apos;&apos; The Soviet Government .... lays all the responsibilityfor these inhuman and rapacious acts committed by the German troops on the criminal Hitlerite Government of Germany.&quot;3. The Allied resolution of the 13th January, the text of which is attached as Annex 3 to the Law Officers&apos; memorandum, is of a general character. certain of the Allied Governments, and in particular the Polish and CzechoslovakGovernments, have since been pressing for a more detailed elaboration of this resolution with a view to committing the Allied Governments to definite actionagainst war criminals. Other Allied Governments, in particular the Netherlands,Belgian and Greek Governments, have shown considerable reluctance to fall in with the Polish and Czechoslovak plans, and have pressed for some lead fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government. The so-called German reprisals against the czechoslovak population for the death of Heydrich, and a recent increase inGerman atrocities in Poland, have intensified Polish and Czechoslovak pressure upon His Majesty&apos;s Government and the other Allied Governments. Inparticular, in a broadcast to Poland on the 9th June, General Sikorski stated :&quot; The perpetrators of these crimes must be brought to account, and this principleought to become the guiding policy of the Allies. Only the announcement ofretribution and the application of reprisals wherever possible can stop the risingbde of madness of the German assassins and save several hundreds of thousands11764   [23992] b
of innocent victims from certain death&apos;.&quot; In a note dated the 2nd June, the czechoslovak Government asked His Majesty&apos;s Government to take due note oftheir intention &quot; to take all the necessary steps which they may regard as desirable to secure retribution .... under the terms of the proclamation of theInter-Allied Conference at St. James&apos;s Palace on the 13th January, 1942.&quot; Onthe 17th June the Czechoslovak Government went further and passed a resolutionholding a list of Germans from Hitler downwards responsible for recentatrocities in Bohemia and Moravia, and providing for their immediate trial and execution after the liberation of Czechoslovakia. These have been broadcast to czechoslovakia in this sense by Dr. Benes and the Czechoslovak Prime Minister.4. Public opinion in this country is also taking an increasing interest inthis question. At least two unofficial committees composed of British and Alliedpersonalities have been formed and have already approached the Foreign Office.Since the Prime Ministers statement of the 25th October, the extension of thewar to the Far East and the conduct of the Japanese troops towards British troops and civilians have also given this country a new and direct interest in thequestion of war criminals.5. It is, therefore, becoming increasingly difficult to refer Allied Govern-ments simply to the general principle enshrined in the Prime Ministers statementof the 25th October, and to refuse to give any further elucidation of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Goverment. Experience in and after the last war also suggeststhat there is a serious danger of public opinion, both British and Allied, gettingout of hand after the war unless some general decision of policy is reached duringthe war. It seems important, on the one hand, to avoid any parallel to the&quot; Hang the Kaiser &quot; campaign, and on the other to avoid a situation arising inwhich far-reaching threats of punishment only result in a handful of trials andin inadequate sentences, as happened after 1918.6. I therefore asked the Law Officers to consider the question and to set out as they have done in the enclosed memorandum, the issues upon which the guidanceof the War Cabinet is required. I do not think that it is necessary or desirable for any further statement of policy to be made at present, but simply that general approval should be given to certain guiding principles, which would enableconversations to take place with the Allied Governments, thus reducing the riskof any unfortunate decisions being reached which might afterwards prove embarrassing to His Majesty&apos;s Government and generally to the policy of theUnited Nations. Our views might then be communicated confidentially to theDominion Governments, United States Government, and, perhaps, also to theSoviet Government. The policy finally to be adopted must, however, be the subjectof agreement between the United Nations, and I do not ask for any final decisionsat this stage.7. One important conclusion to be drawn from the Law Officers&apos;memorandum is that a distinction should be drawn between outstanding enemyleaders, such as Hitler and Mussolini, and other enemy nationals. Judicialprocedure would seem inappropriate for dealing with Hitler and Mussolini, andwith a limited number of important enemy leaders such as Goring, Goebbels andHimmler. It is unnecessary at this stage to define this category precisely. Theguilt of such individuals is so black that they fall outside and go beyond the scopeof any judicial process. Moreover, the precedent of public trials of prominentstatesmen shows that the procedure is rarely advantageous to the prosecution. it therefore seems more advisable to follow the precedent set in the case of Napoleon,and to contemplate a political decision of the United Nations. Judicial procedurebased upon the laws of war would be reserved for the crimes committed by enemynationals other than outstanding leaders. It should be noted that enemy leaderswould not necessarily be synonymous with Heads of States, as this would seem tobe inappropriate in the case, e.g., of Italy, where the decisions have been taken byMussolini rather than by the King. If it is argued that this procedure is unjust inthat subordinates would be tried, whereas their responsible leaders would not,the reply is that the leaders could be dealt with just as severely by the executive action of the United Nations as by process of law.8. I consider the best course to be that each Allied Government should beentrusted with the trial of the cases with which it is concerned, i.e., where the
offences were committed on its own territory or against its own nationals. Inparticular, I regard it as essential that the delays and complications inseparable from setting up special tribunals should be avoided. For this reason, among others, I am not in favour of creating an international court, or, indeed, any other special judicial machinery for this purpose. The war criminals would be tried by military courts, or possibly in some countries by civil courts, applying the laws of war.9. The question of the trial by Allied Governments of their own nationals(e.g., Quislings) should be kept quite separate from that of the trial of war criminals. The offence in such cases is not against international law, but againstthe municipal law of the country concerned, and each country should be left todeal with such cases under that law. No inter-Allied policy is required in this case, though some special arrangements for the surrender of such persons may benecessary.10. To sum up, I ask the approval of my colleagues for the general conclusions indicated in the Law Officers&apos; memorandum and for authority to holddiscussions with the Allied Governments on the basis that, while His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have not reached any final conclusions on the policy to be adopted,the following general principles represent their present views : (i) The fate of outstanding enemy leaders should be decided as a politicalquestion by the United Nations as in the case of Napoleon, and there should beno question of such leaders being tried either by national or international tribunals.(ii) Policy regarding war criminals should ultimately be agreed between allthe Allied Governments concerned.(iii) All accused persons, other than the outstanding leaders whose cases are considered under heading (i), should be assured a legal trial before a recognisedjudicial tribunal. Since the offences under consideration would, at any rate inmost cases, be covered by the laws of war, the appropriate tribunals would generally seem to be the military course of each Ally concerned. It is understoodthat certain of the Allies may desire to use civil courts. No ad hoc internationaltribunals should be established for dealing with these cases.(iv) In dealing with war criminals, whatever the court, it should applyexisting laws and principles and no special ad, hoc law should be enacted.(v) The punishment of war criminals should be disposed of as soon aspossible after the end of the war, in order (a) to ensure rapid justice,\b) to prevent so far as possible wronged individuals taking the law into their own hands, and(c) to prevent trials dragging on for years and so delaying the return to a peaceful atmosphere in Europe.(vi) Each Allied Government concerned should be encouraged at this stage to draw up so far as possible lists of criminals against whom it wishes to proceedand to prepare evidence against them, so as to enable agreed action to be taken as soon as hostilities cease.(vii) Provision should be included in the armistice terms for the immediatecapture or surrender of wanted criminals, and this should not be left over until after the conclusion of a peace treaty. Otherwise it might prove impossible, asafter the last war, to obtain custody of the persons required. Lists, if any,included in the armistice terms should not, however, be regarded as exclusive, and authority would be reserved to demand the delivering up of additional personslater. Each peace treaty would subsequently contain any provisions which mayhe required to enable the action contemplated to be taken.(viii) All possible steps should be taken to prevent war criminals in eithercategory from obtaining asylum in neutral countries. In practice the neutral countries most likely to be concerned would seem to be Sweden and Switzerland,upon whom it should be possible to exercise considerable pressure either to prevent
the entry of such persons or to secure their subsequent surrender to Allied justice.But war criminals might be able to reach more distant neutral territory, e.g., bvaircraft or submarine.(ix) Although no definite period can usefully be fixed at this juncture, it isdesirable, for the reasons set out under (iii) above, that all trials should be instituted within a certain limited period after the termination of hostilities with the enemy Power concerned.(x) A distinction should be drawn between enemy war criminals and nationals(e.g., Quislings) of the Allied countries concerned. The latter should be dealtwith by each Allied Government concerned under its own law, and no inter-Alliedagreement is necessary for this purpose, although some special inter-Alliedarrangements for surrender to the appropriate Allied authority might be required.A. E.Foreign Office, June 22, 1942.
ANNEX.Memorandum by the Law Officers of the Crown.THE object of this memorandum is to set out the issues which require Treatment of consideration.   On policy there has been a statement by the Prime Minister, a War Crimi-statement by President Roosevelt, a resolution by certain of the Allied Govern-  l^ates Vments, and a note by M. Molotov, dated the 6th January.   There was also a iea(jer8 an(jquestion in the House of Commons to the Foreign Secretary on the 10th March, subordinates.1942, about Japanese atrocities in Hong Kong.2. As was recognised after the last war, the procedure which may be appropriate for subordinates who commit recognised war crimes is not necessarilyappropriate for the Head or Leaders of the State. A distinction was drawn inthe Treaty of Versailles between the Kaiser, should he have been surrendered,and others. The relevant paragraphs of the Treaty are attached (Annex No. 6).This distinction was in part based on the fact that the Kaiser was Head of theState, and there was a good deal of discussion as to whether, as such, he could bedealt with as a War Criminal under International Law. The distinction, how-ever, is probably better drawn between those who have controlled and been responsible for national policy in the steps which led up to and the conduct ofthe war, and others, rather than between the individual who is in law the titularHead of the State, and others. In the case of Italy, for example, it is Mussolinirather than the King who is responsible for Italy&apos;s acts. In Germany it may bethat there are others who should share with Hitler the responsibility for german policy and methods.3. The reason for some such distinction becomes apparent on consideringthe main heads of &apos;&apos; war crimes &apos;&apos; as recognised by International Law. Theyare (a) Offences against the laws of war committed in the course of operations.(b) Atrocities in occupied territories.(c) Maltreatment of prisoners of war.Although the responsible leaders may have direct and immediateresponsibility for these or some of them, in that they may have ordered them, thecase against Hitler, Mussolini and other leaders goes far deeper and takes oneinto an area which is beyond that in which war crimes are recognised by Inter-national Law as appropriate for decision and punishment by a court., 4. The fate of Flitler and Mussolini may be settled by events, but on theassumption that they came into the hands of the Allied Governments the followingappear to be the possible courses :  (a) Their fate should be decided, as was Napoleon&apos;s, by the Allied Govern-ments. No doubt if this course were adopted the grounds for theaction taken, in other words, the charges against the individual leaderin question would be formulated in some formal statement which need not be necessarily elaborate in detail.(b) A tribunal of Allied or Neutral, or Allied and Neutral, judges should beset up, who should investigate and pronounce on the charges, adoptinglegal procedure, hearing evidence, the defence of those arraigned, andso on, and decide the punishment.(c) The same as (&amp;), but restricting the tribunal to findings, leaving the punishment to be decided by the Allied Governments.(d) To submit charges to a body of judges or lawyers with power to alter oramend or add to them. Such a body would not be a tribunal, andthere would be no trial or hearing, though they would have power tocall for papers or possibly hear witnesses.[23992] c
It seems to us that the &apos;&apos; charges &apos;&apos; would go beyond any recognised war-crimes, and the.first objection to a tribunal is that it would have to formulate anew law under which the acts embodied in the charges became offences appro-priate to be dealt with by a court. One of the nnrin charges in any indictment of hitler would be that he brought about the war by successive unprovoked attacks on innocent neighbour States with a view to dominating Europe by force and making it subservient to Germany&apos;s will and needs. A further charge would be his unprovoked attacks on innocent neighbours in the course of the war with aview to improving his military position. These are crimes against civilisationbut, rightly or wrongly, not recognised as crimes under International Law to bedealt with and punished by a court.5. There is another consideration which has a good deal of force. In theReport which the Law Officers (Lord Birkenhead being then Attorney-General)made to the War Cabinet on the 28th November, 1918, with regard to the Kaiser,no definite view was expressed as to whether he should be arraigned before a tribunal, or exiled, or otherwise punished by the decision of the Allies. On theother hand, the Law Officers expressed the view that it would be unprofitable to seek to charge him with responsibility for the origin of the war, as this wouldinvolve endless disputation. In an Interim Report of a special sub-committeeappointed in this matter after the last war certain suggested charges which might appropriately be made against the Kaiser were put forward. These includedwaging an aggressive and unjust war, invasion of Belgium and Luxembourg, andsystematic terrorism in Belgium and France, followed by some further twelve other charges. If such matters as these had really been tried out in detail the processwould have been, or at any rate might have been, made interminable. The twocharges which the Law Officers suggested in the Report already referred to werethe invasion of Belgium and the order of unrestricted submarine warfare.Although in the treaty it was provided that a tribunal should be set up, wecannot help feeling that, at any rate so far as these two important charges were concerned, a tribunal was not required in order to establish the Kaiser&apos;responsibility. The same, we should have thought, would apply, possibly witheven greater force, to the main charges, which would justify the Allies in takingwhat action they thought proper against Hitler and other leaders. Breaches of treaties and engagements, unprovoked hostilities against neutrals are there forall to see, and the broad policy adopted in occupied countries does not need further investigation in order to substantiate the main facts. These are the lines onwhich, as it seems to us, the argument against a tribunal and trial developthemselves. It may be that arguments will be put forward in favour of a tribunalprocedure. The general case for referring to an impartial tribunal mattersappropriate for its decision do not need to be stated. It may be doubted whether any tribunal that could be assembled would be regarded by those in enemy countries as impartial, but, apart from this point, we thought it right to set outthe legal and practical objections which we think ought to be considered againstthe tribunal policy It may be easier to make a final decision when more considera-tion has been given to the formulation of the matters which would be put forward.as the fundamental grounds for any action that may be taken.War Crimes.6. The three most likely categories of war crimes are those set out above,namely : (a) Atrocities in occupied areas.(b) Maltreatment of prisoners of war. .(c) Offences against the Laws of War committed in the course of operations.The first of these is the subject of the Resolution of the Allied Governmentsalready referred to. This resolution places among the principal war aims ofthe signatory Powers the punishment by legal procedure of those responsible forthese crimes, whether they ordered, carried out or participated in them. It isno doubt intended that each occupied country, when it regains its freedom, shoulditself deal with those who have committed such crimes on its soil. The questionno doubt of procedure would be one for the Allied country concerned, but in ouropinion the proper court for dealing with this offence, as also with other war crimes, is a military court. There is some authority for saying that even ordinarycrimes committed by an enemy soldier while in occupation of a territory are not
within the jurisdiction of the ordinary civil courts of that territory either at the-time or subsequently when the enemy has been expelled. In any event, however,a military court seems to us appropriate, and some of the cases will no doubt raisematters particularly appropriate for such a court. For example, an act ofbrutality in occupied territory may be sought to be justified under InternationalLaw as necessary in the circumstances for the maintenance and safety of the occupying forces.7. Those who can be proved to have been guilty of maltreatment of prisonersof war are, of course, proper subjects for trial and punishment. If the prisonersof more than one of the Allied Governments are involved there no doubt mightbe some question as to the composition of the court and who should undertake theburden of the prosecution, but there should be no difficulty in solving this question.8. With regard to breaches of the laws and customs of war in the course ofmilitary operations, this is probably more difficult,. We understand that thereis but little evidence available which would enable individuals to be identified.In the course which the war has taken breaches of this kind by our enemies have in some directions compelled us, on perfectly legitimate grounds, to adopt methods which we should not have resorted to had the enemy not resorted to them. It isprobably also true that the vast majority, though not necessarily all, of thesecases are cases where the act done was carried out under orders and under ageneral policy laid down by the military authorities. The question of theDefence of Superior Orders is considered below, but in the main we considerthat the case for proceeding against individuals as war criminals under this headis probably less strong than under the two preceding ones, though there mightbe individual cases, for example, if a crew or passengers had been fired on whilegetting away in boats.9. After the last war the whole policy in effect broke down on theimpracticability of obtaining the custody of those against whom it was desiredto proceed. In the result, as is well known, a small number of war criminals &quot;weretried by a German court at Leipzig and, although there were a few convictions,the result was regarded as very unsatisfactory. The only thing that can be saidis that the fact that a certain number, of German officers were tried and convicted of war crimes by a court of their own country shows clearly the appropriatenessof applying legal procedure to such acts if it is desired. There is nothing usefulthat can be said on this aspect of the matter at this stage of the war. Thedifficulty, of course, arose in 1919 from the fact that the defeated countries werenot occupied.10. The question what effect ought to be given to a plea that the accusedwas acting under orders was considered after the last war in some detail. Thereis little clear authority on the point, and we set out below the paragraph dealingwith this subject in the Report of the Committee of Enquiry into the breaches of the Laws of War.&quot; Superior Orders.&quot; 41. The Committee have devoted considerable attention to thequestion whether an accused person can plead superior orders either in barof his trial or as a mitigation of his offence. They are of opinion that no person should be punished for the commission of an act which he did not know to be forbidden or which he could not reasonably be expected to knowto be unlawful. They recognise the fact that military discipline requires that members of the armed forces of a State should obey the commands oftheir superiors, and that such discipline also requires that those who executesuch commands should do so with a knowledge that they will be immune from punishment for so doing. The Committee cannot, however, accept the doctrine that it is the duty of a sailor or soldier never to question an order which he receives. They consider that, if the act constituting the offencecharged was done in obedience to the order of a superior, this should betreated as prima facie a defence, but that such defence might be displacedby proof :  &apos;&apos; (a) That the order did not relate to a military duty.&apos;&apos; (5) That the act charged was in excess of and not covered by the ordergiven.&quot; (c) That the act charged was flagrantly and obviously contrary to the laws and customs of war and of humanity.[23992] c 2
&quot; (d) That there were circumstances from which knowledge of theillegality of the order could be imputed to the accused.&quot; (e) That it was an order in regard to the execution of which the accused had a discretion.&quot; If the plea of superior orders does not succeed as a defence, it may still be relevant as a circumstance to be considered in mitigation of punishment.&quot;We are not quite sure whether we accept the view that it is prima facie a defence. We think probably the right view is that it is not a defence; but itwould be contrary to all our principles to proceed after hostilities are overagainst a subordinate acting under orders in circumstances in which he clearlyhad no option but to obey. To take an obvious example, if there had been anillegal shooting, no one would think of proceeding against the firing squad:they would proceed against the officer who had ordered the man to be shot.11. We think it is important that decisions on policy should be taken, evenif they can only be provisional, as to what cases or class of cases it may be desiredto take proceedings. This will enable available evidence to be collected and casesprepared with the minimum of delay. It may well be that in the closing stagesa large measure of retribution will be inflicted, not under legal process but inthe inevitable course of events. It may also be that this will have more effectthan a long series of individual trials after hostilities are over. ,D. B. S.D. P. M. F.Law Officers&apos; Department,April 15, 1942.List of Annexes.1.

Annex No. 5.Extract from Parliamentary Debates (House of Commons), March 10, 1942.Hong Kong (Japanese Barbarities).Sir John Wardlaw-Milne (by Private Notice) asked the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs whether he is yet in a position to make a statement regardingthe treatment of military prisoners and civilians by the Japanese army at HongKong after&apos; the capitulation ?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Eden) : Yes, Sir. Out ofregard for the feelings of the many relations of the victims, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have been unwilling to publish any accounts of Japanese atrocitiesat Hong Kong until these had been confirmed beyond any possibility of doubt.Unfortunately, there is no longer room for doubt. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare now in possession of statements by reliable eye-witnesses who succeeded inescaping from Hong Kong. Their testimony establishes the fact that theJapanese army at Hong Kong perpetrated against their helpless militaryprisoners and the civil population, without distinction of race or colour, the same kind of barbarities which aroused the horror of the civilised world at the timeof the Nanking massacre of 1937.It is known that fifty officers and men of the British army were bound handarid foot and then bayoneted to death. It is known that ten days after thecapitulation wounded were still being collected from the hills and the japanese were refusing permission to bury the dead. It is known that women, both Asiaticand European, were raped and murdered and that one entire Chinese district was declared a brothel, regardless of the status of the inhabitants. All the survivorsof the garrison, including Indians, Chinese and Portuguese, have been herdedinto a camp consisting of. wrecked huts without doors, windows, light orsanitation. By the end of January 150 cases of dysentery had occurred in the camp, but no drugs or medical facilities were supplied. The dead had to beburied in a corner of the camp. The Japanese guards are utterly callous, and therepeated requests of General Maltby, the General Officer Commanding, for an interview with the Japanese commander have been curtly refused. Thispresumably means that the Japanese High Command have connived at theconduct of their forces. The Japanese Government stated at the end of Februarythat the numbers of prisoners in Hong Kong were : British 5,072, Canadian 1,689,Indian 5,829, others 357; total 10,947.Most of the European residents, including some who are seriously ill, havebeen interned and, like the military prisoners, are being given only a little riceand water and occasional scraps of other food. There is some reason to believethat conditions have slightly improved recently, but the Japanese Governmenthave refused their consent to the visit to Hong Kong of a representative of the protecting Power and no permission has yet been granted for such a visit by therepresentative of the International Red Cross Committee. They have, in fact,announced that they require all foreign consuls to withdraw from all the territories they have invaded since the outbreak of war. It is clear that theirtreatment of prisoners and civilians will not bear independent investigation,I have no information as to the conditions of our prisoners of war and civilians in Malaya. The only report available is a statement by the Japaneseofficial news agency of the 3rd March stating that 77,699 Chinese have been arrested and subjected to what is described as &quot; a severe examination.&quot; It isnot difficult to imagine what that entails.It is most painful to have to make such a statement to the House. two things will be clear from it, to the House, to the country and to the world. TheJapanese claim that their forces a,re animated by a lofty code of chivalry,Bushido. is a nauseating hypocrisy. That is the first thing. The second is thatthe enemy must be utterly defeated. The House will agree with me that we can best express our sympathy with the victims of these appalling outrages byredoubling our efforts to ensure his utter and overwhelming defeat.Sir J. Wardlaw-Milne: Arising out of this statement, terrible and horribleas it is, may I ask my right hon. friend whether he will do everything possible tomake the facts public, so that the people of this country will really at last know what they are up against and put their backs into the war ?
Mr. Eden: Naturally we had to be most careful about the facts before we made this statement. That is the only reason why it has not been made sooner.The Government felt that it would be wrong to make a statement unless theywere absolutely convinced of the facts. That being so, in spite of the sufferingsof the relatives, we felt, it was our duty to make the truth known.Sir Percy Harris: Will my right hon. friend make it clear that not only theEmperor, but the Government and the whole Japanese people, are responsiblefor these atrocities, and not merely the army?Mr. Eden: Yes, Sir, that is certainly so.Mr. Lawson: Will special steps be taken by the B.B.C. to let the German andItalian people know how the New Order is working under their new ally ?Mr. Eden: The widest possible publicity in all languages will be given tothese tragic facts.Captain Sir William Brass: Is Japan a member of the League of Nations ?Mr. Eden: No, Sir, she is not.Captain McEtven: My right hon. friend said that the Japanese Governmenthave asked for the withdrawal of all foreign consuls from places they have occupied.

Davison: Has anything been heard of the assurance given by thegeneral in command of the Japanese troops to whom Singapore was surrenderedthat decent treatment would be extended to those who surrendered and that therules of Bushido would be carried out ?Mr. Eden: I have said that I have received no definite reports from Malaya,but the Government cannot regard the position as satisfactory until Japan allowsthe Protecting Power and the International Red Cross to function.Mr. Bellenger: With reference to my right hon. friend&apos;s answer that thewhole of the Japanese nation is responsible, surely the general officer commanding the Japanese is personally responsible and should be held personally responsibleby us ? Will my right hon. friend make it perfectly clear that we hold him personally responsible ? Does this not show the futility of our capitulation ofsuch a large body of prisoners ?Mr. Eden: Obviously the Japanese general officer commanding is primarily responsible, but the Government are also responsible for not allowing the protecting Power to do its duty.Mr. Granville: In view of the fact that General Bennett has arrived inAustralia from Singapore, can my right hon. friend give any information as towhether there is an adequate food supply, for prisoners who are in Singapore?Annex No. 6.Treaty of Versailles.Part VII.
