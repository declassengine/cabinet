R. Baldwin, Privv CouncilOffice.War against Japan : Participation by Canadian Forces.1. The Prime Minister expressed appreciation of the opportunity of havingthe War Committee and the Chiefs of Staff confer with Mr. Churchill, the other united Kingdom representatives present and the United Kingdom Chiefs ofStaff.2. Mr. King explained that the question of the nature and extent of canadian participation in the Japanese war had been receiving the considerationof the Government and their military advisers.In recent discussions it had been generally agreed that, at the end of the warin Europe, Canadian military forces should participate in the war against Japan,in operational theatres of direct interest to Canada as a North American nation,for example, in the North or Central Pacific, rather than in more remote areas,such as South-East Asia, that Government policy with respect to the employmentof Canadian forces should.be based on this principle and that the form and extentof participation should be determined following the present Quebec meeting.
This represented a statement of preference in the matter of operationaltheatres. The Government would be prepared to have Canadian forces employedin the Northern Pacific or in the Central Pacific area, the latter to includeoperations from as far south as Hawaii, and against, for example, Formosa orthe Philippines.The Government could not take firm decisions nor could plans be made for appropriate Canadian participation until the general strategic plan for accom-plishing the defeat of Japan had been settled. The roles to be allotted to UnitedKingdom forces Navy, Army and Air in the execution of the over-all plan would affect the form of Canadian participation.In general, the Government felt that the Canadian military effort shouldbe in the main areas of assault through the North or Central Pacific and not inremote tropical theatres.3. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom emphasised the difficulty which the United Kingdom itself was experiencing in having the United Statesagree to participation by British forces in the Pacific. He would discuss withthe President what might be possible in the matter of Canadian participation in the light of the statement made by Mr. King. The difficulty was that therewere only a limited number of &quot; front seats &quot; for the Japanese war.Detailed plans for operations against the Japanese and as to the part to be played by the British forces had not yet been settled. Only that morning it hadbeen agreed that a full strength British Battle Fleet would operate, under UnitedStates command, in the main Pacific theatre. This would offer an opportunityfor employment of units of the Canadian Navy in accordance with Canadianpolicy. It had also been agreed, in principle, that a substantial long-range bomber force would be provided by the Commonwealth for the bombing of the JapaneseIslands.Solely for purposes of planning and subject to regular review, it had nowr beenagreed to assume that the war against Japan would terminate eighteen monthsafter the end of European hostilities.4. The United Kingdom Chief of the A ir Staff said that, in discussions with the Canadian Air Staff, a total number of 58 P.C.A.F. squadrons had beenemployed in preliminary planning for the occupation of Europe and for the war against Japan.It was now proposed that the British would provide 40 long-range bomber squadrons against Japan, and it had been suggested that, of these, Canada might provide from 14 to 18. These arrangements, however, were subject to furtherconsideration with the United States Chiefs of Staff. Further, the figuressuggested for the R.C.A.F. component were not rigid in any way and could be adjusted to meet the decisions of the Canadian Government.5. Mr. Churchill said that plans for land operations in the Central Pacific-had not been finally determined, nor were the final intentions of the United Statesknown in the matter of a campaign in the North Pacific. Participation by theBritish Army would probably be concentrated in South-Eastern Asia.British personnel serving against Japan would be given the benefit of specialrates of pay.Any participation by the Canadian Army might appropriately be made inthe Central or North Pacific, where it could represent the Commonwealth. Itwould not be appropriate or necessary to-have Canadians serve in the tropical orsemi-tropical areas of South-East Asia.In any case, the wrar against Japan would not be a war of numbers but would consist largely of attacks by Naval and Air Forces. In these circumstances, itshould not be expected that large numbers of Canadian Army personnel wouldbe called upon to participate.        , ,In summary, it would appear appropriate to suggest that Canadian Navaland air formations should participate in the war against Japan in direct co-operation with British forces while any role allotted to the Canadian Army wouldbe carried out in co-operation with the forces of the United States.6. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff observed that the main operation against Japan would probably take place across the Central Pacific, with, perhaps a subsidiary operation from the North.7. The Prime Minister expressed the view that the proposed allotment ofR.C.A.F. squadrons to the Pacific under discussion between the United Kingdom[28312] b 2
and CanadiaifStaffs was too heavy in itself and disproportionate to the contribu-tions contemplated for the other Services. This proposal would require furtherconsideration in relation to the commitments to he made with respect to the Armyand Navy.It was essential that plans be so ordered that Canadian forces would beavailable for employment against Japan in the latter decisive stages of the war.This would be an important consideration in determining Government policy as tothe measure of participation by the Canadian Navy, Army and Air Force.In deciding upon the part which Canada would play in accomplishing the defeat of Japan, the Government had to take into consideration the capacity andreadiness of the Canadian people to assume further financial commitments ofgreat magnitude in addition to those resulting from the war effort to date and theheavy undertakings involved in the programme of social legislation, includingthe extensive provisions made for the re-establishment of ex-Servicemen.8. Mr. King suggested that, in the circumstances the Canadian Chiefs ofStaff should now confer with the United States Chiefs of Staff with regard to the role which Canadian forces might play in the Pacific.Operational awards.9. The United Kingdom Prime Minister described detailed proposals under;consideration for submission to the King in the matter of special awards toBritish forces serving during the present war in the various operational theatres.It was now proposed that the 1939-43 Star would be available to all personnel from overseas who had served in the British Isles.10.   The War Committee noted Mr. Churchill&apos;s proposals in this matter.Armistice with Germany.11. The Prime Minister enquired whether progress had been made indevising an effective means for associating the more interested Allies in acceptanceof the German Instrument of Surrender.12. The United Kingdom Prime Minister replied that he understood that the surrender of Germany would be accepted by General Eisenhower as Commander-in-Chief, on behalf of all the United Nations.13. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff expressed the same under-standing.Occupation and control of Germany.14. The Prime Minister said that the Government were prepared to haveCanadian forces take an appropriate part in the occupation and enquired asto plans for the occupation and the method by which countries supplyingoccupational forces would be associated with arrangements for control ofGermany.15. The United Kingdom Prime Minister replied that by the employmentof mobile ground and air forces it was hoped to limit the numbers required forthe maintenance of control. It wras also intended to rely upon the Germans them-selves for the performance of administrative functions under the immediatecontrol of the Allied occupational forces.Demobilisation policy.16. The United Kingdom Prime Minister, in response to an enquiry bythe Minister of National Defence, explained that the United Kingdom plan for demobilisation of Service personnel was based upon factors of age and lengthof service. Key personnel required urgently for civilian activities would be released, but their services would remain at the disposal of the Government.It was also intended to employ extensively recent entries to the Services inthe military duties remaining to be carried on after the defeat of Germany.
2 u 3Central Mediterranean operations.17. The Prime Minister enquired whether any decisions had been takenregarding future operations in the Central Mediterranean which might involvethe First Canadian Corps.18. The United Kingdom Prime Minister emphasised the heavy characterof the fighting now going on in Italy. It could be expected that these operations would continue to be arduous for some time to come. Future strategy in theMediterranean theatre would have to be determined according to the progress ofevents, and it was hoped that the Canadian Corps would continue with the allied forces there until the job was done.Quebec Conference, 1914: United Kingdom-United States meetings.19. The United Kingdom Prime Minister, reporting generally upon current discussions, said that good progress had been made in meetings between the UnitedKingdom and United States Staffs in a most favourable atmosphere. It was expected that, before the Conference ended, mutually satisfactory decisions wouldhave been taken upon the several important problems under consideration.The Canadian war effort: co-operation with the United Kingdom.20. The United Kingdom Prime Minister expressed the deep appreciationand gratitude of the British Government and people for the part played by canada in the extent and quality of her military effort, in the provision of greatquantities of supplies and in the generous extension of large measures of financialassistance.The problems which had confronted the United Kingdom and canadian government&apos;s in the course of the war had been solved through close and readyco-operation. The success of our joint efforts might be attributed not only to these factors but to the fact that our actions had been hallowed by a righteous cause.The financial position of the United Kingdom after the war would be one ofthe greatest difficulty. She would emerge the world &apos;s greatest debtor, the world&apos;sonly debtor. Assurances had already been received that the United States would continue those measures of material assistance which would enable the UnitedKingdom to play her full part in the war against Japan and to re-establish herselffollowing the final victory. It was hoped that it would be possible for theCanadian Government to pursue a similar policy.21. The Prime Minister expressed appreciation of Mr. Churchill&apos;s remarks.This eloquent tribute belonged properly to the Canadian people themselves. TheGovernment had merely interpreted in action the will of the people. From the outset Canada based her policy on a total effort for total war. Canada would continue to do her part until final victory had been won.The Canadian Government and people were fully aware of the vital natureof the issues involved in the conflict and appreciated the unique role which wasbeing played by Mr. Churchill in accomplishing the final victory.The War Committee adjourned at 4-30 p.m.A. D. P. HEENEY, Secretary.
