THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 547.-21th September, 1944...   ..   .TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILL-1939 STANDARD(CLAUSES 45 and 46).Memorandum by the Minister of Town and Country Planning.1. I was invited by the Reconstruction Committee, at the meeting on the21st September, to suggest, when one of the early amendments to Clause 45 came up for discussion in the Committee Stage in the House of Commons, that thereshould be a general discussion on the points of controversy arising on Clauses 45and 46, and thereafter to make a statement that the Government would review the matter in the light of the discussion before the Report Stage. The intention was that the Government would then review the whole position and decide whatproposals they should submit to the House on the Report Stage. I appreciate that if Government amendments are put down before the Committee Stage, the opposing sides, whose points of view are reflected in the amendments already on the Paper, might join in an attack on the Government amendments. On theother hand, I feel sure, and the Chief Whip agrees with me, that an indicationon the Paper of what Government amendments will be made to meet the wide-spread objection to these clauses in their present form would greatly facilitateprogress on the Bill. This is a most important consideration since the time-table on the Bill is now a vital matter; and it is also to be borne in mind that,if the amendments are not put down before the Committee Stage, it would benecessary to recommit the Bill.2. I therefore seek authority to put down amendments in accordance withthe proposals made below.3. I regret that I should find it necessary to ask my colleagues to travel overground which has now become somewhat wearisome. It is, however, only by so doing that I can show how I arrive at the solutions proposed in thismemorandum, which, although far from perfect, are. in my belief, the only possible way of dealing with the matter.4. I would first of all say that my view shared, I think, by many of mycolleagues is that there is no hope of getting the proposals through parliament in their present form. I feel, moreover, that, even if that were not so, therewould be little hope of securing effective administration of the powers of theBill if the provisions of Clauses 45 and 46 remain as at present drafted. Thereis a powerful attack on the clauses from many quarters, inside and outside Parlia-ment; and among ourselves there is a strong feeling that the provisions are notonly unjust but illogical.5. It has been strongly urged by the Local Authorities in their represen-tations to me, and the point was pressed strongly in the House on Second Reading,that the clause should provide a ceiling. The point is likely to be pursued whenthe Bill is in Committee. I need not again go closely into the merits of thematter. Two reasons, to my mind, are conclusive why the standard should beretained (a) the Government have declared their view strongly that there is at present no &quot; market&quot; as a basis for valuation, and that in many areas, e.g.,Copy No.[28297]
Ramsgate, market value would be unfair even if it could be ascer-tained, since it would reflect a purely temporary depreciation of valuesdue to the war. I do not think it would be practicable to go backon these conclusions;(b) to base the acquisition price on a ceiling and not a standard would gravelyupset the administration of the War Damage Act.6. The next question is whether the percentage increase, provided for by clause 46 (which would have regard to the increase of building costs), shouldbe given, as under the Bill as it now stands, only in respect of dwellings withincertain limits of rateable value and agricultural properties, or whether, if not.it should be given in respect only of certain other classes of properties or inrespect of all other classes of properties. I am advised that it is not possible tosay that there has been a rise in prices only in the case of dwelling-houses withinthe limits of rateable value fixed by the Bill, and agricultural properties; and Iam strongly of opinion that the escalator provision should be applied to all classesof buildings. Moreover, it is difficult in principle to resist such a provision for,if in fact there has been no rise in the prices of any particular class of buildings,the escalator need not be applied to that class.7. The view was expressed in the Reconstruction Committee that, if a power was taken to apply a percentage increase to any class of property, there oughtalso to be power to apply a percentage reduction should general economicconditions cause a decrease and not an increase in 1939 values. I agree, and propose that the provision should be so drafted.8. There was strong feeling in the Committee that, if a general escalatorclause is adopted, it would be essential to add to the Bill some specific provision to deal with obviously speculative transactions in land which had taken place sincethe Government had made their first announcement on this subject, on thepublication of the Interim Report of the Uthwatt Committee. This point hasalso been pressed on me by the Local Authorities, and I have every sympathy with it. Having, however, gone carefully into this matter, I find that there would bevery great difficulty in drafting provisions to give adequate effect to the proposal.The difficulty arises from the fact that, from a variety of causes, the thing to be purchased by the Local Authority will not, in a very great number of cases, bethe same thing as the owner purchased. Thus, for example, ownershipsmay have been sub-divided or amalgamated since purchase by the presentowner, the value of leasehold interests will almost certainly have changed,improvements may have been carried *out, and so on. These complications couldbe dealt with only by a series of clauses of great complexity and difficult in practical application. It is, I think, material in this connection that the war damage Act, under which value payments are calculated by reference to 1939prices, makes no differentiation between the speculator who has bought a propertyat less than the 1939 price and other owners.9. The only remaining question is. I think, whether only owner-occupiersshould be entitled to a percentage increase under the Bill as drafted, or whetherall owners should have the benefit of it. The limitation in the Bill to owner-occupiers is based on the consideration that the person&apos;who is himself using theproperty will need at once to obtain an equivalent alternative property if he isdispossessed, which he would not be able to do if he received only the 1939 price.Whether there is a case on other grounds for entitling other classes of owner toa percentage increase based on an increase in building costs seems to me to bedebatable. But the limitation of the concession of a percentage increase under clause 46 to the owner-occupier who is in physical occupation at the date of theservice of the notice to treat may undoubtedly cause great hardship and much badfeeling, particularly in the case of Service men and others who own their homesbut are not at present in possession of them because of war circumstances; andI have been able to find no workable alternative to the test of physical occupationif the limitation to &quot; owner-occupier &quot; is to be retained at all. On this practicalground, therefore, I recommend that all owners should have the benefit of the&quot; escalator,&quot; based, as I have said, on the rise in building costs.10. It was suggested in the Reconstruction Committee that to take power toapply an escalator clause to any class of property in which there had been anincrease in value through a rise in building costs would be tantamount toabandoning the 1939 standard. I do not think that this would be so. One of thegreatest difficulties in the process of reconstruction is that so soon as it starts indeed, so soon as it is in contemplation there is a grave danger of a steep rise
in values for redevelopment. This danger will disappear when the proposals inthe White Paper have become law, but in the meantime the -1939 standard (withan addition authorised by the Government) would avoid this risk, which otherwisecannot be escaped.11. There is one further matter which, although it does not directly concern the provisions of the Bill, is nevertheless of the greatest importance to its administration. This is the question of the acquisition of properties in respectof which, but for the acquisition, a cost of works payment would be made.Briefly the position is that, under Section 14 of the War Damage Act, 1943, a cost of works payment is converted, by the service of a notice to treat, into a valuepayment which (again because of the rise in building costs) is wrorth much less.The effect of this is that there will lie opposition all along the line to compulsory purchase for the purpose of replanning, which must produce this result ininnumerable cases. There has been an attack on this provision for this reason no less than on the provisions of the Bill which deal with the acquisition price ofundamaged properties. Indeed, most of the representations I have received havelinked the two matters together.12. This difficulty would be overcome if value payments under the war damage Act were escalated in conformity with any escalation of the purchase price under the Bill. Power for this purpose is contained in Section 11 of theWar Damage Act. which might, however, require some amendment in detail.13.   In summary form, the proposals I submit to my colleagues are (i) that an escalator clause should be included in the Bill followinggenerally the provision in Section 11 of the War Damage Act, 1943.under which a percentage increase could be made in respect of any class of property, and that a provision should also be included underwhich a percentage deduction could be made from the 1939 valuewhere that was appropriate;(ii) that all owners, and not only owner-occupiers, should be entitled to thepercentage increase, and be subject to the percentage deduction:(iii) that I should be authorised, when the point is raised in the Debate, asinevitably it will be, to say that payments in respect of war-damagedproperties under the War Damage Act will be brought into line withany authorised payments under the amended proposals of the Bill inrespect of undamaged properties.14. I ask authority to put clown, before Committee Stage, amendments tothe Bill in conformity with the proposals summarised in the previous paragraph,and to make a statement on the lines I have suggested in regard to payments under the War Damage Act.W.
