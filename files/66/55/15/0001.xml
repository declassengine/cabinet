THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 515.9th September, 1944.WAR CABINET.MORALE IN GERMANY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a paper on Morale in Germany, whichbrings up to date the*information contained in W.P. (44) 408 of the 24th July last.This paper represents the agreed views of the various Departments concernedwith the question, including the Service Departments.SIJvCE our last report, Germany&apos;s situation has deteriorated catastrophic-ally. The circle of the Allied Armies is now rapidly closing in on Germanyitself. The German Armies in the West have suffered crushing defeats in battleand are in rout. In the East, though the Soviet Armies have been checked onthe North and Central fronts, they are again going over to the offensive. Inthe South, the defection of Roumania and Bulgaria threatens the whole german military position in the Balkans with disaster, and, in addition, deprivesGermany of important oil and wheat resources. Finland, and possibly Hungary,may at any moment follow the example of Roumania and Bulgaria. Slovakiais in revolt. At home there has been the plot of the 20th July against Hitler,followed by a second attempted &quot; total mobilisation &quot; so drastic that even someGerman propagandists have described it as unbearable except for a short period.Even before the attempt on Hitler, the German people, despite german propaganda, were generally aware that something was wrong on the fighting,fronts, and that the outlook for Germany was becoming serious. The Alliedbreak-through in France, following up the rapid breach of the Atlantic Walland the pace of the Allied advance up from the Mediterranean, must haveshattered the confidence of the German people in the strategy of the german high Command. As to the East, many Germans are aware that the Centralsector collapsed and that the greatest efforts were needed even temporarily to stabilise the line between Warsaw and East Prussia. The Party has conscriptedthe civilian population of East and West Prussia and of Silesia to dig fortifications-tions, and those panic-stricken refugees who have managed to evade theprohibition of flight from the threatened areas must be spreading demoralisationin other parts of the Reich. No attempt has been made to conceal the gravity ofthe consequences to the whole German position in the Balkans of Roumanianand Bulgarian defection, but it is doubtful whether the German people fully appreciate how grave the consequences are.Throughout July and August, Allied bombers have appeared constantlyby day over the Reich and heavy night attacks have been resumed. Though air attack caused great damage.and disorganisation and temporarily depressed localmorale, the attention of almost every German is increasingly dominated by themilitary situation and even more by its repercussions upon the individual in the shape of total mobilisation. In comparison, the German people have gained littlecomfort from the much-boosted German counter-offensive with retaliatory weaponsagainst Great Britain.A.

The plot against Hitler of the 20th July, evidently implicating a wide circleof important military officers and civilians, has further undermined confidence inNazi leadership. To a growing majority of Germans it has confirmed that thewar is irretrievably lost. The savage purge which followed and the propagandatreatment of the trial of the German generals has in some cases discredited theGerman High Command and in others alienated sympathy from the regime amongboth officers and civilians. The increase of Himmler&apos;s influence over the Armyappears greatly to have sharpened the Army&apos;s antagonism to the S.S.None the less, the reaction of the German people to this attempted coup hasshown that the masses are so fatalistic, so weary, so lacking in initiative and soterrified of Nazi repression as to be incapable of supporting or. indeed, of takingmuch interest in an attempt to overthrow the regime with a view to securingpeace. An increasing number are. however, awakening from the illusion thatobedience is the only road to safety and are becoming less concerned with thefuture of Germany and more concerned with the question of their own survival.While careful to avoid any action which might arouse the suspicions of the gestapo, whose control is still powerful, a great many Germans are now contri-buting less and less to what thev regard as a lost cause. Many others are stilltaking refuge from the consciousness of approaching defeat by burying their headsin the sand. Only a few fanatics still go on irrationally counting on ultimatevictory and continuing to offer their services with unquestioning loyalty.The will to fight of the German soldier is growing markedly more patchy.Apprehension on this score is being displayed by the High Command, who. inan endeavour to counter a dwindling faith, have caused the issue of broadcastsand official publications urging unwavering faith in the High Command andreminding the soldier of the binding terms of his oath. Regimental esprit de corpsis on the decline. This unit loyalty, together with discipline, formed the two main bases of German military morale. Only in S.S. and parachute formationsis it now being encountered, and. in general, it may be said that ingraineddiscipline remains the mainstay of the Army. Lack of air and armoured supportis &quot;undermining the German infantryman^ will to fight. Four-fifths of prisonersof war taken in France believe the war to be lost. Hitler&apos;s &quot; last round &quot; orders have met with increasing criticism from officers, particularly those at high level.The attempt on Hitler&apos;s life has had but little effect on the ordinary soldier, whois too concerned with day-to-day anxieties and bodily needs to be greatly affectedby so remote an event. Desertion is increasing. Individual desertions are commonand there is a growing tendency for whole units to go over to the enemy. this tendency had already become marked during the retreat in Russia and drasticsteps were taken by the High Command in an endeavour to check the defection.Since the last report the will to fight of the German soldier has in general shown a marked decline.The fuel shortage, and the resulting curtailment of operations have had aserious overall effect on German Air Force morale. This has not been offset by theintroduction of limited quantities of jet- and rocket-propelled fighters. &apos; the morale of German Air Force night fighter crews, however, remains relatively high.There is at present no sign of a crack in German naval morale. U-Boats are fighting vigorously. There is no evidence of the morale in larger units, but their recent activity may well prevent any lowering of it at present. Morale is, as isnormal, lower in small vessels and in shore establishments. Knowledge that thenavy can hardly decide the course of the war and that the German armies arebeing defeated may later cause the navy to fight less heartily, but so far onlyisolated instances of a drop in fighting determination are credibly reported.We conclude that while the will and ability of the German civilian population to support the war effort still continue to decrease, possibly at an increased rate,apathy, an inherent sense of discipline, fear of Nazi repression, and a lack ofinitiative make it now even more unlikely than it was before the 20th July thatthey will themselves take any positive action in any direction. Any organisedattempt to overthrow Hitler or to conclude peace can come only from the circleof leaders, military or Nazi.
