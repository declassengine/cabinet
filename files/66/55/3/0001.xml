SOCIAL insurance-INTRODUCTIONi The first duty of Government is to protect the country from external aggression. The next aim of national policy must be to secure the generalprosperity and happiness of the citizens. To realise that aim two courses of action must be followed. The first is to foster the growth of the nationalpower to produce and to earn, with its accompanying opportunities for&quot;icreased well-being, leisure and recreation. The second is to plan for theprevention of individual poverty resulting from those hazards of personalfortune over which individuals have little or no control.2. Neither of these courses of action can be effective alone. In a communitywhose earning power was seriously impaired by its failure to use its people and resources effectively that is to say, by unemployment or inefficiency :t would be impossible to avoid widespread individual poverty, whateverspecial measures were adopted. But it is also true that a nation with ahigh power of production would not have solved its problem if it includedany appreciable section of people who were in want, whether through lossof individual earning power, due to ill-health, unemployment or old age, or through inability to provide properly for their children. Only when this problem is also solved has a community achieved genuine social security.3. This latter question was, therefore, one of the first to which the Govern-ment turned their minds when they began to develop a programme of post-war reconstruction. There were definite reasons why, though not logically the firstitem on the agenda, the question of social insurance engaged attention fromthe outset. For one thing, it had a particular urgency in the minds of verylarge numbers of people who had before the war suffered directly or indirectlyfrom prolonged unemployment and its consequences. Again, the problems involved were concrete, specific and wholly within the scope of domestic policy; whereas the problem of achieving full employment turned in parton the shape of the post-war world and on other circumstances which couldnot at that stage be foreseen. Lastly, much had already been done; thetask was, not to start afresh, but to expand and improve a system, of social insurance already at least as advanced, in nearly every respect, as any inthe world.4. As far back as June, 1941, therefore, when so far as could then be judged the menace of heavy air attack and invasion had not yet beenlifted, the Government invited Sir William Beveridge to take charge of a comprehensive survey of existing schemes. In November, 1942, he presentedhis Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services (Cmd. 6404). This was an outline plan, covering &quot; all citizens without upper income limit . . . all-embracing in scope of persons and needs.&quot; It did not purport to be a com-plete and final scheme, ready for immediate translation into legislative form.The detail had still to be worked out. Further, the plan was based on threeassumptions; first the institution of a scheme of children&apos;s allowances, secondthe framing of a comprehensive health service, and third the avoidance of mass unemployment. But they were assumptions onh/, and as the3&apos; were not an integral part of the plan, Sir William Beveridge, naturally and property,did not attempt in his Report to work out detailed proposals for implementingthem.5. The Government, while accepting these assumptions as necessary pre-requisites to an improved and comprehensive plan of social insurance, haveBiad to examine them closely in order to be reasonably sure that they couldlie realised in practice.The Government^ proposals for a national health service were already underconsideration and have been published, as has their policy for maintaining a34532 a 3
high and stable level of employment alter the war. Their plan for a schemeof family allowances is included in this paper.On the social insurance scheme itself the Government have reviewed thequestions of policy which were raised by the Report and on which the Govern-menfs views as originally announced were and could only be provisional.Much time and labour have also had to be devoted to working out and fittingtogether the details of the scheme and as this Paper amply illustrates,social insurance is essentially a mosaic of detail. In the result the Goverr.ment are now in a position to put forward their proposals for a new schemeof social insurance. There are still some few points on which decisions havenot yet been reached. On all the major features, however, firm proposalscan now be made.The Underlying Principles6. Before the war, social studies had made it plain that in its more extremeform poverty affected households of two kinds those in which the bread-winner was ill or out of work or past working age, and those in which thenumber of children strained overmuch the available resources of the house-hold. The Government therefore conclude that there must be both anincreased rate of sickness and unemployment benefit and retirement pension,and a system of family allowances which will contribute substantially tothe maintenance of growing children. The cost of these family allowanceswill he met wholly from the proceeds of taxation; they are thus outside thebounds of the scheme of social insurance properly so called. With that one exception, the Government have adhered to the principle that freedom fromwant must be achieved in the first instance by social insurance that benefitsmust be earned by contributions. This has long been one of the essential features of British social legislation, and the Government believe that itreflects the desires and the characteristics of our people.The rate&apos;s Share7. But, even so, let it be well remembered that the contributions frominsured persons and their emplo^/ers cover only part of the ground. Theywill not contribute directly to family allowances nor, of course, to National\assistance; and their contribution to the National Health Service will be relatively small. The balance has to be found from taxation. Towards thewhole cost of the services named 54 per cent, at first and, twenty years later,64 per cent, will have to come from taxation; and looking at the narrowerfield of insurance only, 31 per cent, at the outset, rising in twenty years to50 per cent.The Widened Scope of Social Insurance8. The Government have also decided that the scope of social insurance should be extended in two different senses the range and amount of benefitsprovided and the number of people included. All the existing types ofbenefit will be increased, in most instances substantially, and they will beextended to include death grant. The scheme as a whole will embrace, not certain occupations and income groups, but the entire population. Concreteexpression is thus given to the solidarity and unity of the nation, which inwar have been its bulwarks against aggression and in peace will be itsguarantees of success in the fight against individual want and mischance.9. Certain other general principles have been adopted in framing thepolicy set out in the following pages. There has been no attempt to varycontributions with the earnings of those who make them: broadly theprinciple adopted has been that of equal benefits for equal contributions.   Atthe  same  time  contributors  and  beneficiaries  have  been  classified_notaccording to earnings but according to way of life-into six groups, differing
in respect of the benefits they need and the contributions they must make toreceive them.io. The Government have also adopted the principle that the administra-tion of a single, comprehensive, universal scheme of social insurance mustbe unified, and that the various uncoordinated sections of the system of to-day must be brought within a single administrative framework.II. Certain other considerations of a general kind have been present toitie mind of the Government in framing their pi-iicy. One is that the stability of a vast scheme of this kind depends upon strict administrative economy inevery sense. Indeed, any laxity in the organisation of the unified systemor in the administration of benefits would threaten the long-term continuanceof the scheme by laying it open to legitimate and damaging public criticism.But economical administration is not a matter for the Government alone it. requires the full co-operation of the public. Ail pay into the fund; all mustbe its custodians. It is for the Government to organise the provision of benefits;the citizen too has a part to play to see that they are not misused.The Level of Benefit12. In fixing the rates of benefit to be provided under the scheme theGovernment have considered whether it would be practicable to adopt a sub-sistence basis for benefits. In the debates of February, 1943, they expressedthe preliminary view that it was not practicable and further examination ofthe question has confirmed this view.In the first place, the definite linking of benefit to subsistence rates might involve the frequent variation of benefit rates in accordance with the cost ofliving. It is true that it would be possible to ignore minor fluctuations, butthe main objection would remain.In the second place and more important social insurance must necessarilydeal in averages of need and requirement. It cannot adapt itself to the almostinfinite variety of individual conditions. Circumstances vary, not only betweenplaces but between people, and the conception of relating individual paymentsprecisely to individual needs is not really capable of realisation in an insurancescheme, particularly where that scheme covers all classes of the community.It is an essential feature of an insurance scheme that equal contributionsshould provide equal benefits within a class or group.13. Benefits must be paid for, and a high level of benefit must mean a high level of contribution. The Government therefore conclude that the rightobjective is a rate of benefit which provides a reasonable insurance againstwant and at the same time takes account of the maximum contribution whichthe great body of contributors can property be asked to bear. There still remains the individuals opportunity to achieve for himself in sickness, old age and other conditions of difficulty a standard of comfort and amenity whichit is no part of a compulsory scheme of social insurance to provide. And in reserve there must remain a scheme of National Assistance designed to fill the inevitable gaps left by insurance and to supplement it where an examinationof individual needs shows that supplement is necessary.Contents of the Paper14. There is one important matter included in the Report which is not dealtwith here the problem of industrial injury insurance, or workmen&apos;s coinpen-sation. The Governments policy on this subject will be set out in Part II.With that exception the present Paper covers the whole field of social insurance. It sets out a policy designed to be complete and coherent in itself,though but a single and limited instalment of the comprehensive series of proposals needed to constitute a complete economic and social policy for theperiod of reconstruction.34532 A 4
ooII-THE GOVERNMENTS PROPOSALS IN BRIEF.The following is an outline of the main Government proposals. A fullerexposition of each topic is given in the paragraphs mentioned after eachheading.Universality and Classification (paragraphs 33-45)15. There will be a compulsory scheme of national insurance, unified iiadministration.The scheme will include everybody. The population will be divided intosix classes employees (Class I), the self-employed (Class II), housewives(Class III), adults who do not earn (Class IV), children (Class V), and peopleover working age (Class VI). Those below working age will be providedfor by family allowances; those of working age by insurance benefits; andthose bc3&apos;ond working age by retirement pensions. The scheme will apply-to large categories not hitherto covered by insurance, c.g. those living on earnings gained otherwise than by salar3&apos; or wages, or on earnings above 420 a year or on private income; and those employed in professions or indus-tries hitherto specially excepted.Each insured person will pay a single weekly contribution for all benefits in the form of one stamp on a single document.Contributions (paragraphs 46-49)16. The rates of weekly contribution for persons over age 18 (coveringfor Class I the benefits under the Industrial Injury Insurance Scheme as wellas the Social Insurance Scheme) will be:  	Class I			Class II	Class IV	Insured person	Employer	Total		Men Women   ...	s.   d. 3 10 3   0	s.   d. 3   1 2   5	s.   d. 6 11 5   5	s.   d. 4   -3   (&apos;	s.   d. 3   4 2   SFamily Allowances (paragraphs 50-59)17. Services in kind, including meals and milk at schools, will be ex-tended; and a weekly cash allowance of 5s., derived from taxation, will beintroduced.For the purpose of family allowances the children to be taken into accountare those below school-leaving age and those remaining at school above thatage, until 31st July following their 16th birthday. Of such children thefirst will not be counted for an allowance, although, where the parent is inreceipt of benefit, 5s. will then be added to the benefit in respect of that child.Orphan&apos;s Allowance (paragraph 60)tS. For every child both of whose parents are dead, there will be a weekly allowance of 12s., of which 5s. will come from taxation, and the balance of7s. from Insurance Funds.Sickness and Unemployment Benefit (paragraphs 61-70)19. There will be a standard rate of benefit of 40s. a week for a married couple and 24s. for a single man or woman, with lower rates for those under 18.Both benefits will be limited in duration, but in different ways.   Sickness
benefit will end after three years of continuous disability and invaliditybenefit at the standard retirement pension rate be substituted. Unemploymentbenelit will end after 30 weeks or a somewhat longer period in the case of those with a good employment record. (Periods covered by training allowance will not be taken into account.) After the end of either benefit, further contri-buiions must be paid before an insured person can requalify for &quot;benefit.Benefit will be reduced when the contributors insurance record does notcomply with the prescribed contribution conditions.Training Allowance (paragraph 71)20. Special allowances at a higher rate will be available to persons under-going a course of approved training. The cost of training will be met from taxation, subject to a contribution from the Social Insurance Fund.Sickness Benefit for the Self-Employed (paragraphs 72-78)21. People working on their own account will not receive sickness benefitduring the first 4 weeks of any period of illness.Depcndnnt&apos;s Allowance (paragraphs 79-81)22. An additional allowance but only one will be paid to those on singlebenefit (sickness, invalidity or unemployment) who have an adult dependant.It will be 16s. a week (15s. when added to invalidity benefit).Retirement Pensions (paragraphs 82-105)23. There will be a standard rate of retirement pension of 35s. for a married couple and 20s. for a single person. Pensions will be paid only to thosewho have retired, and will be reduced if more than 20s. weekly is earned duringretirement. The minimum age of retirement will be 65 for men and 60 forwomen, but the joint pension will become payable when the husband qualifies,whatever the age of the wife, provided that if she is under 60 she is notgainfully occupied.Pensions will depend upon contributions paid during the working life of the  applicant and will be reduced when the contribution record shows a deficiency.Those who postpone retirement beyond the age of 65 (or 60 for women)will, when they do retire, get pensions increased by 2s. a week (joint) andis. (single) for each year of work after pensionable age.Special arrangements will be made covering persons already pensionedor insured when the scheme comes into operation.Slarried Women (paragraphs 106-120)24. The provisions to meet the needs of married women in the event ofthe illness, unemployment, retirement or death of their husbands are described elsewhere.For childbirth, the following benefits (which will also be made available tounmarried women in all insurance classes) will be available:  (i) a maternity grant of  4; and, in addition,(ii) for gainfully occupied women, maternity benefit at the rate of 36s.a week for 13 weeks, provided that occupation is given up for that period; 01(iii) for women not eligible for maternity benefit, an attendants allow-ance of  1 a week for 4 weeks.These benefits will be subject to certain qualifying conditions.In addition there will be special provisions enabling married women to insurefor a personal retirement pension of 20s. a week in lieu of their share in a joint&quot;
IOretirement pension, and enabling employed married women earning more than20s. a week to insure for:  (i) sickness benefit (after the first 4 weeks if self-employed) at the rateof 16s. a week; and(ii) unemployment benefit at the rate of 20s. a week.If the woman is living apart from her husband and can get no support from him, these benefits will be at the rate of 24s. a week.Widows (paragraphs 121-131)25. The main provision for widows will be:  (i) A benefit of 36s. a week (with 5s. added for the first child, if the widow has one) for the first 13 weeks of widowhood. This will be payable to women widowed under 60 and to those widowed over that age whose--husbands had not qualified for retirement pensions. It will, for the first13 weeks, take the place of the benefits described below.(ii) If there is a dependent child, a guardian&apos;s benefit of 24s. a week(with 5s. added for the first or only child).(iii) A widow&apos;s pension of 20s. a week to widows who are 50 or over atthe time when the husband dies or when the children cease to be dependent,provided that at least ten years have elapsed since the marriage.These benefits will be at a reduced rate when the husband&apos;s contributionrecord shows a deficiency and will terminate on remarriage; guardian&apos;s benefit and widow&apos;s pension will be reduced for substantial earnings.There will be special provisions for women who are already receiving widows&apos;pensions and for women who at the start of the new scheme are married tomen already insured for widows&apos; pensions.Death Grant (paragraphs 132-136)26. Death grant will be paid at the following rates according to the age at which the death occurs:  under 3 years of age ...      ... ...      ... ...      ...      ... 6between 3 and 6      ...      ... ...      ... ...      ...      ... 10between 6 and 18    ...      ... ...      ... ...      ...      ... 15over 18 ...      ...      ...      ... ...      ...      ......... 20For persons over 65 at the beginning of the scheme, no grant will bepaid, and for persons then between 55 and 65, the grant will be  10. Nogrant will be paid in respect of a child dying below the age of 10 who wasborn before the beginning of the scheme.27. Summary of main Benefit RatesSingle man or woman  ...

These weekly rates arc increased by 5s. where the beneficiary has a singledependent child, or, if he has more than one such child, by 5s. in respect of thefirst child.The scheme also makes provision for maternity, widowhood and death(See paragraphs 24 to 26 above.)Benefit while in Hospital (paragraphs 137-142)28. The following benefits will be reduced hy 10s. a week during mainten-ance in hospital after the first 28 days of such maintenance: sickness andinvalidity benefit, maternity benefit, widow&apos;s benefit, guardian&apos;s benefit,widow&apos;s pension and retirement pension.Duplication of Benefits (paragraphs 147-151)29. Not more than one social insurance benefit or pension will be payable to an individual at any one time. When a war or industrial pensionerbecomes eligible for a social insurance benefit, there will be some adjustment in the benefit payable.Administration (paragraphs 152-158)30. A Ministry of Social Insurance will be set up which will be responsiblefor the whole of social insurance. The administration of assistance will bekept separate from the administration of insurance, though the Minister of social Insurance will be responsible to Parliament for both.National Assistance (paragraphs 159-161)31. The present responsibilities of public assistance authorities for the pay-ment of assistance in cash will be transferred entirely to the Assistance Board.Approved Societies (paragraphs 162-166)32. The Government have come to the conclusion that it is not practicable to retain Approved Societies either as independent financial units or as agents in the administration of the scheme.HI-UNIVERSALITY AND CLASSIFICATIONWhy the Scheme is Universal33. To extend the range of social insurance, as now proposed, from asingle, homogeneous group of employed wage and salary earners, to theentire population of all ages, and all occupations or none, is a change&apos;of very great scope and consequence. The reasons of principle for making it have already been referred to in the Introduction to this Paper. They are,briefly, that in a matter so fundamental it is right for all citizens to stand intogether, without exclusions based upon difference of status, function orwealth. Secondly, that there are many people at present outside the scopeof national insurance whose need of its benefits is at least as great as thatof many of the insured population. Thirdly, that without universality it isnot possible adequately to maintain the cover needed during various normalchanges from insurance class to class.The New Classes34. Universality of application means that in addition to the classes atpresent insured there will be brought into the scheme various sectionsof the population which have not hitherto, except possibly as voluntarycontributors, been covered by Government schemes of social insurance. Thereare, as instances, first, people with incomes over the present insurable limit;second,  those who are substantially free from a risk for which social
insurance provides, e.g. the public servant in relation to unemployment;third, those who are exposed to a risk but are already protected against iiunder the terms of their existing employment, c.g. the police in relation to sickness and old age; and fourth, those who are exposed to risks but arenot at present insured against them, e.g. the independent trader. With theintroduction of a universal scheme the special arrangements in the presentunemployment insurance scheme for banking and insurance and for agricu]ture will come to an end.35. The application of the principle of universality must inevitably lengthenthe task of working out and bringing into operation the new scheme of social insurance. That task would in any event have been considerable, on accountof the other changes proposed. But its complexity is much increased by extending it beyond a single class. To bring a universal scheme into opera-tion will therefore take an appreciable time. But the Government aresatisfied that the advantages of such a scheme are so great that the timeneeded to bring it into operation is well justified.36. The scheme, since it is universal, must take account of the differentways of life and requirements of different sections of the community. For thispurpose it is proposed to adopt the method of classification recommended inthe Report, as follows:  Class I:  Employees.Class II: Others gainfully occupied.Class III: Housewives.Class IV: Other persons of working age not gainfully occupied.Class V: Children below working age.Class VI: Persons retired and above working age.Register of Insured Persons37. Under the new scheme it will be necessary to obtain and classifyinformation about the whole population so as to enable every person to beplaced in his or her appropriate insurance class. After that it will be necessaryto compile and maintain one or more central registers, in which the insurancerecord and status of every insured person will be entered and kept up todate. The register will be an essential feature of the scheme for several reasons, first to record classification and transfer between classes, second tofacilitate enforcement of the payment of contributions, and third so that the record of any insured person in relation to contributions and benefits canbe ascertained when necessary. The task of organisation involved in com-piling and maintaining the register is obviously one of the first magnitude,but it is an unavoidable step and one which must ultimately promote efficiency and economy.The Excepted Classes38. Reference has been made (paragraph 34) to the absorption into thescheme of those not hitherto in social insurance. Among these are those sections of the population who are in employment and therefore within thenew Class I (employees) but have hitherto been specially excepted. Thecivil service, police and some local government and railway employeesare examples. They have been excepted because they are adequately protected against sickness and old age by their conditions of service, and are substantiallyfree from the risk of unemployment. But it is an essential part of the principleof universality now adopted that, notwithstanding their privileged positionin these respects, they should pay the same contributions as other employed persons.
Ai39. The adjustment of their conditions of service should not, as regardspay during sickness, present serious difficulties. As regards retirement pensions, the position is difficult. The age of retirement in these groupsvaries, but it is commonly less than 65 and much less in the case of the police.The new scheme, on the other hand, contemplates a working life up to age65, with inducements in the form of a higher pension to continue workbeyond 65 and with training and rehabilitation for those who might otherwise have to give up work prematurely.40. The simplest course, from many points of view, would be to pay bothretirement pensions the occupational (derived from the special schemes inforce for particular groups) and the contributory (derived from the social insurance Fund). But with the rate of contributory pension now proposed,the double pension would amount to very nearly as much as the previousearnings of lower paid workers and that without taking account of anylump sum payable on retirement.41. There is also the question whether unemployment benefit should beavailable after retirement to those, e.g. police, who as a matter of systemretire on pension before reaching the standard retirement age.42. Discussions will have to take place with representatives of the variousgroups concerned about the adjustments necessary, particularly those arisingfrom the inclusion in the general insurance scheme of persons covered by existing pensions schemes.Private Pensions Schemes43. There are many private superannuation schemes operated by industrialfirms and business houses. It may be that as a result of the new compulsorysocial insurance scheme some employers and employees will wish to review their own schemes.44. By section 27 of the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age contributory pensions Act, 1925 (re-enacted in section 28 of the consolidating Act of1936) it was made easier to modify existing schemes when the benefits theyprovided became duplicated by the new statutory pensions. These provisionswere designed principally to meet those cases where the managing body couldnot modify the scheme or could do so only at the cost of undue delay orexpense. Broadly, they authorised such modifications as might be thought necessary subject to reference to the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies andto such conditions as he might impose. The relation of the new system to private schemes might equally be regulated by provisions on these lines.The Armed Forces and the Merchant Navy45. Under the existing schemes there are special contribution arrangementsfor the Armed Forces of the Crown which secure rights to the benefits of theschemes on return to civil life. For the Merchant Navy there are alsospecial arrangements adjusted to the conditions of employment. these special arrangements, with any necessary modifications, will be continuedunder the new scheme.Contributions46. The new insurance Classes have been set out in paragraph 36.The contributing Classes will be Classes I, II and IV. Members of these classes will pay contributions related to the benefits provided for their paxti-cular Class and for Classes III and VI. The benefits will be sickness benefit,invalidity benefit, unemployment benefit, retirement pensions, benefits for widows and death grant; and certain special benefits for mothers. Unem-ployment benefit will be restricted to persons in Class I (employees) and
sickness benefit and invalidity benefit to persons in Classes I and II (othersgainfully occupied). For persons in Class II sickness benefit will be payableonly after the first four weeks of incapacity for work. Provision will bemade for Class V (children below working age) by family allowances, andfor Class VI (persons retired and above working age) by retirement pensions.47. Each insured pwson will pay a single weekly contribution for allthe benefits to which he is entitled, in the form of one stamp on a single docu-ment. The stamp will also include, in the case of employed persons, the contribution for insurance against industrial injury. This unification of con-tributions in one stamp is in itself an important step which will be a convenience-ence to all concerned and will diminish the burden of administration.48. The amount of the contribution (including for Class I the benefits under the Industrial Injury Insurance Scheme as well as the Social InsuranceScheme) will vary with the individual^ class and sex. The following table shows the different rates of contribution:  	Class I			Class II	Class IV	Insured person	Employer	Total		Men  Aged 18 and over Aged 16-i 8	s.   d. 3 10 2   5	s.  d. 3   1 2   1	s.  d. 6 11 4   6	s.  d. 4   2 2   9	s.  d. 3   4 2   2Women  Aged 18 and over Aged 16-18	3   0 2   0	2   5 1   7	5   5 3   7	3   6 2   3	2   8 1 1049. Every week in the year must be accounted for either by contributionsor by excusals or exemptions granted in special circumstances (see appendix iii, paragraphs 5 and 6)IV-FAMILY ALLOWANCESObject of the Scheme50. The following proposals are based upon two principles, first that nothing should be done to remove from parents the responsibility of maintain-ing their children, and second that it is in the national interest for the state to help parents to discharge that responsibility properly. The scheme hereset out is not intended to provide full maintenance for each child. It iarather a general contribution to the needs of families with children.Provisioa in Kind51. The purpose of such a scheme can best be attained if a substantial part of the benefit is given in kind. The school meals and milk services will therefore be so extended as to make them available to pupils in primary and secondary schools in receipt of grant from the Ministry of Education or theScottish Education Department. These benefits in kind will be free of costto the parents and will&quot; be available for all the children in a family attendingschool, including the first. The cost to public funds will be large. It isestimated that when the service has reached its full development the cost of supplying meals and milk to children at school will be of the order of  60million a year. This figure does not fall far short of the total cost of the cash allowances described in the succeeding paragraph. These cashallowances will at the beginning of the scheme involve expenditure which.
17including  5th million as the cost of paying allowances for the first child whenthe parent is on benefit, is estimated at  69 million. The figure of  60 milliontakes no account of the provision which may be made for children underschool age, for which no estimate of cost can at present be given.Cash Allowance52. A flat rate cash allowance of 5s. will be payable for each child afterthe first. This will be paid, not out of contributions, but out of general taxation. The first child is excluded because it is reasonable to assume thatone child at any rate can be maintained from family earnings. But when thehead of the family is on benefit an allowance of 5s. a week will be payable outof die Social Insurance Fund for the first child.To whom payable53. In the absence of special circumstances (such as divorce or separation)the order for the payment of the allowance will be made out in favour of thefather as the normal economic head of the household. But it is regarded asnatural and appropriate that the mother should cash the order and it willbe drawn in such a way as to entitle her also to do so.Eligible Children54. For the payment of family allowances, &quot; children &quot; will be taken to mean those below the upper age-limit for compulsory school attendance andthose above that age-limit who are still at school full-time, or are apprentices,up to the 31st July after their 16th birthday. Above those ages a child willnot be reckoned a member of the family.Thus, if there are four children in a family aged 17, 13, 11 and 9, no account will be taken of the child aged 17 and there remain, therefore, threequalified children, for whom two allowances will be payable. When the child aged 13 leaves school, or after the 31st July following his 16th birthday(if he is then still a&apos;, school), the number of qualified children will be reducedto two, and only one allowance will be payable.55. The 31st July after the 16th birthday is a more convenient limiting datethan the birthday itself, because it fits in better with the school-leavingarrangements. If a child continues at school beyond this date any cash allow-ance should be by way of educational grant on the basis of ascertained heed.The contributions which under the insurance scheme would normally be payable from age 16 would then be excused (i.e. deemed to have been paid)so long as education continues.The Family Unit56. The exclusion of one child in each family makes it important to define the group of children who are to be regarded as a family unit. For thispurpose the unit will in general be the family by blood (and not, for example,the household), including step-children and legally adopted children. Nor-mally, no question of stopping the allowance will arise if, for example, a childgoes to live for the time being with some other relative. But if the pre-sumption that the parent is the maintainer is upset, arrangements will haveto be made to reckon the child as a member of the familv of the &quot;ersoiiactually maintaining it.Persons abroad57. The broad object of the scheme is to assist parents born and living inthis country, but it should also extend to the families, living in this country,of British subjects born outside this country, or for the time being livingoutside it.   It will be necessary to frame a residence test for this purpose.
Aliens will be eligible only if their stay has been long enough to justify their being regarded as regular members of this community.    Children livingabroad will not be eligible for allowances, though short temporary absences(e.g. on holiday) will be ignored.*Duplication of Allowances58. There will be no duplication with allowances payable under otheschemes.Children in Institutions59. The scheme is essentially one for the benefit of the family. When a child is in an institution no allowance under the scheme will be paid to theauthorities of the institution. Where, as a result of a judicial order or similar circumstances (e.g. where a local authority has assumed parental rights),the child is no longer in the care of the parents, payment of allowance to them will cease. Otherwise it is proposed that the allowance should continue to bepaid to the parents while a child is in an institution, even though under thenew Health Service no charge will fall upon parents for the maintenance and treatment of children in hospital.V-ORPHAN&apos;S ALLOWANCE60. Special allowances will be paid for orphan children, both of whoseparents are dead. These will be at the rate of 12s. a week and the first childwill not, as in the family allowance scheme, be excluded. Of this amount,7s. will be an insurance benefit payable from the Social Insurance Fund,without any qualifying condition. The balance of 5s. will be provided out ofgeneral taxation.   The weekly allowance of 12s. will be paid in one sum.VI-SICKNESS AND UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITRates61. The standard rates of sickness and unemployment benefit will be 403.a week for a married couple, and 24s. a week for a single person. For insuredmarried women there will be lower rates (see paragraph 116 (ii) ). For boysor girls aged 16 or 17 the rate will be 15s.Contribution Conditions62. At present the contribution conditions which a claimant must satisfyin order to qualify for benefit are quite different in National Health insurance and Unemployment Insurance. In Health Insurance all contributors havethe same benefit year, namely the calendar year from January to December,and their right to benefit depends on contributions paid in the contributionyear which ended in the previous July. In Unemployment Insurance eachclaimant has his own benefit year, which begins when he makes a successfulclaim. In Health Insurance, title to sickness benefit at the full standard ratedoes not arise until 104 actual contributions have been paid; benefit at a lower rate is payable after payment of 26, but less than 104, contributions. in either case the rate of benefit is subject to reduction if less than 50 contribu-tions have been paid or excused in the last complete contribution year beforethe current benefit year. (Contributions are excused where the contributoris sick, or unemployed and available for work.) Unemployment Insurancerequires 30 contributions actually paid in the period of two years before theclaim to benefit. Having once satisfied this condition, the contributor beginsa benefit year.
63. The contribution conditions for sickness benefit and unemploymentbenefit will be brought into line, so that a contributor entitled to benefit ofcither kind will be entitled also, so iar as contributions are concerned, to benefit of the other kind. For this purpose, the new conditions will be onthe model of the present Health Insurance condition.,. Thus there will bea fixed benefit year, in which a contributor will be entitled to benefit of either kind at the standard rate if he has had:  (i) 26 contributions actually paid; and(ii) 50 contributions, paid or excused, in the last complete contributionyear before the beginning of the benefit year.Waiting Time64. For sickness and unemployment benefits there will be a waiting timeof three days, i.e. benefit will be payable only from the fourth day. Wherehowever, the sickness or unemployment has lasted for at least four weeks,benefit for the first three days will then become payable.Duration of Benefit65. Sickness Benefit. To a contributor who has 156 contributions actually paid, sickness benefit will be paid for the first three years of any continuousperiod of sickness. For this purpose, illnesses separated by less than threemonths will be treated as a continuous period of sickness. If the contributorhas exhausted all the sickness benefit due to him, he will, so long as heremains incapable of work, receive invalidity benefit at the same rate as the retirement pension, viz. 35s. (joint) or 20s. (single) (the rate for marriedwomen will be lower- see paragraph 116 (ii)). Where the contributor has lessthan 156 actual contributions (but at least 26) he will be allowed sickness benefit for one year only, instead of three years. At the end of that year therewill be no invalidity benefit.66. Unemployment Benefit. Unemployment benefit will be paid up to a limit of 30 weeks in a continuous period together with additional days wherethe contributor has a good record of employment in recent years. Separateperiods of benefit will, for this purpose, be treated as continuous if they areseparated by less than three months.The Need for a Limit on Benefit67. The Report recommended that both sickness and unemployment bene-fits should be unlimited in duration, subject, in the case of sickness, to specialbehaviour conditions, and, in the case of unemployment benefit, to the require-ment of attendance at a work or training centre after a limited period of un-employment. As alread3&apos; announced in Parliament, the Government cannot accept this recommendation: thej&apos; think it reasonable and prudent that both sickness and unemployment benefits should have some limit attached tothem. As regards sickness benefit, the Government recognise the need for more generous provision for long-term illness than is made in the presentinsurance scheme, but they feel that sickness benefit of unlimited durationwould be psychologically unwise and would tend to encourage those subjectto recurrent periods of sickness to lapse into chronic invalidity. As regardsunemployment benefit, they agree that training schemes are of the utmost importance in preventing unemployment and in securing fluidity of labour,and that claimants unreasonably refusing to undergo a course of training should be disqualified from receiving benefit. They are satisfied, however,that a requirement to undergo training after a certain period of unemployment would not constitute an effective safeguard against possible abuse of benefit.34532 A 5
VIII-SICKNESS BENEFIT FOR THE SELF-EMPLOYED72. The provision of sickness benefit for persons working on their own account (i.e. Class II) creates a difficult problem. The Class will be a verymixed one. It will include rich and poor alike; at one end of the Classwill be the largest employer of labour, the financier, the leader at the Baror the best-selling author; at the other the small shop-keeper, the window-cleaner and the hawker.    Many of the poorer members of this Class willRe-Qualifying Condition68. At present, when a contributor exhausts the unemployment benefitdue to him, lie cannot qualify for benefit again until, besides satisfying theother conditions, he lias paid 10 contributions since he exhausted his benefit.This re-qualifying condition will be applied in the new scheme, not only to unemployment benefit, but also to sickness benefit where the contributor hasexhausted his right to that benefit (see paragraph 65 above). That is to sa;he will be entitled only to invalidity benefit until he has paid 10 further contributions.Effect of Shortage of Contributions69. The present Health Insurance scheme provides benefit at a reducerrate where a contributor has less than 50 contributions, paid or excused, in ?contribution vear. The Unemployment Insurance scheme has no such arrangement. It gives an unemployed man either benefit at the full rate or none atall. In the new scheme, a shortage of contributions will involve scaling clownof both sickness benefit and unemployment benefit, according to the numberof contributions deficient.Transitional Cases70. It is the Governments intention that as far as practicable the new rates and conditions for sickness, invalidity and unemployment benefits should be applied as soon as the)&apos; come into operation to persons who arethen receiving sickness, disablement or unemployment benefit under thepresent schemes.VII-TRAINING ALLOWANCE71. When an unemployed person takes a course of approved training or industrial rehabilitation, he will receive a training allowance at a higher rate than unemployment benefit. This training allowance will not reduce the totalnumber of days of unemployment benefit due to him. It will continue for anything up to four weeks .after the end of the course, so as to cover anyshort interval between the course and a new job. People who, after training,are transferred to jobs away from home will receive a settling-in allowance forthe first few weeks.Training schemes with training allowances will be available to suitable persons (including widows) in Classes I, II, III and IV.Training allowances will not form part of the Social Insurance scheme, but will be paid, in the first instance, out of the proceeds of taxation under thearrangements for promoting employment sponsored by the Ministry of Labour.Since the contingent liability on the Social Insurance Fund for persons whowould otherwise be a charge on the Fund will be reduced through the training scheme, an annual contribution not exceeding /50o,ooo will be made by theFund to the Exchequer towards the cost of training.
be as much if not more dependent on good health for their earnings as are the members of Class I, and accordingly as much in need of benefit for all periods of sickness, short or long. Moreover, the Class will include certain categories who are fully insured against sickness under the existing scheme share-fishermen, outworkers, small contractors for service, and voluntary contributors who are self-employed. Again, though the new scheme/ ill make it unnecessary to continue the existing provisions for voluntaryinsurance, men and women will still transfer from employment to work ontheir own account-from Class I to Class II. There will indeed be others who do not make a clean-cut transfer from one Class to the other, but who,in each year, do a certain amount of work in each Class, and contributeaccordingly.73. It is estimated that there will be about two and a half million personsin Class II and no doubt the great majority of them will be in an economic position little if any different from that of the majority in Class I. Theconclusion might seem obvious, that all members of Class II should begiven the right to sickness benefit from the onset of illness. But there areat least two formidable difficulties in the way-the cost to the insured person,and the very real administrative difficulty of effective control over the paymentof benefit.The Problem of Cost74. The contribution that is required for persons in Class II is high 4s. 2d.for men, 3s. 6d. for women-and, since there is no &quot; employer &quot; to bear ashare of it as in Class I, it falls wholly on the contributor. If sickness benefitwere made payable from the onset of illness instead of after the first four weeks,as is proposed, the Class II contribution would have to be increased by another 3d. a week.The Problem of Control75. The more serious difficulty, in the Governments view, is to secureeffective control over the payment of benefit. An inefficient standard ofadministration might seriousl3&apos; prejudice the success of the whole scheme. this problem of control is particularly difficult when it relates to benefit payable for short periods to people working on their own account, often in their own home. Many people in these circumstances could often carry- on with their workand continue to esrn their means of livelihood even though sick and confined to their rooms. The fact must be faced that the Class II person, having elected to work on his own account, will be in an entirely different position from the employed person. It is impossible to assume that medical certification, no matter how efficient, will be able to overcome all the difficulties of administra-tion.76. Sir William Beveridge was impressed by the formidable nature of these difficulties, of which he rated the difficulty of control as the more serious.While fully recognizing the need of many in the Class for full cover againstsickness, he concluded that they ought to tarry the risk of their minorillnesses and proposed that they should get benefit only &quot; if, and to the extent that, the disability lasts more than 13 weeks.&quot; He was aware that certain persons (share-fishermen, etc.), who at present get benefit from the beginningof an illness, would be worse off to the extent that they would get nothing for the first 13 weeks; but pointed out that for prolonged illness theywould get altogether better provision than at present. The Report also proposed that contributions should not be excused during the first 13 weeks ofillness.3453-JA 6
The Governments Proposals77. The Government share the views expressed in the Report about thedifficulties of framing a national scheme for providing sickness benefit for persons in this Class; and they agree that it would be wrong to pay benefit from the beginning of an illness. After reviewing the whole matter very carefully, however, they feel that to pay benefit only after the first thirteenweeks, even though it may be justifiable on grounds of prudent administratioand sound insurance principles, does not go far enough to meet the acknow-ledged need for better cover on the part of many people in this Class. They,therefore, think it right, while remaining fully aware of the risk of abuseinvolved, to pay benefit to Class II contributors after four, instead ofthirteen, weeks, and to excuse payment of contributions during those four weeks. This rule will apply to each period of sickness however short the&apos;interval separating any two periods.Some Special Problems78. Even so there are certain minor difficulties, already alluded to, whichwill call for further consideration:  (i) There is the difficulty of the existing voluntary contributor, entitledto benefit from the onset of illness. If he falls into Class I there will beno difficulty; if into Class II he will be deprived of cover for the first four weeks of illness. If he falls into Class IV, he will lose altogether the rightto continue his cover against illness. This seems to the Government tobe inevitable; though it maj&apos; be possible, during the necessary transitional period, to preserve in respect of past contributions some right to benefitto persons falling into Class II and Class IV.(ii) Special provisions will be necessary to govern the position of personswho pass permanently from Class I to Class II, or vice versa, and also of those who alternate between the two Classes.(iii) The problem of the outworkers, small contractors for service andshare-fishermen (other than those who, being employees, will fall intoClass I) is one of special difficulty. They will lose not only cover forthe first four weeks of illness, but also, being in Class II, the benefit ofthe &quot; employer&apos;s &quot; share of the contribution, which most of them enjoyat present. The Government do not doubt that these groups should beincluded in Class II; they obviously cannot be put in Class I, whose, mem-bers are insured against unemployment, since unemployment benefit can-not be paid to those who are in a position to determine the extent andincidence of their own unemployment. It is impossible to say what will bethe size of the problem presented by these special classes when the schemecomes into operation; the number of outworkers, for instance, will un-doubtedly be reduced by the compulsory exemption of those married women who do not earn more than 20s. a week. In any event, the people in these special classes, in spite of contrast in certain respects between their presentand future positions, will be getting, like other contributors in Class II, full value for their money,&quot; and the question whether, and if so how, any furthercover can be provided for them must await further examination in the lightof the circumstances prevailing nearer the date when the new scheme is introduced.IX-DEPENDANTS ALLOWANCE79. If anyone entitled to sickness, invalidity, or unemployment benefit hasan adult dependant, he will be paid a dependants allowance, provided thathe is not entitled to joint benefit for himself and his wife and that thedependant belongs to one of the classes for whom the present Unemployment
Insurance scheme provides dependants benefit. (The allowance will be payable only in respect of one dependant at a time.)80. Thus, a man or woman will be able to count as a dependant an invalidfather or widowed mother, or adult sister or daughter (subject to conditionsabout residence, maintenance, etc.), or a housekeeper, whether resident ornon-resident, who looks after his or her dependent children. In addition, a.&apos;oman whose husband is an invalid and dependent on her will be able to count him as a dependant. But a man who has a woman living with him as his wife, or has living with him a person not related to him who keepshouse for him, will not be able to count her as a dependant unless he hasdependent children and she looks after them. The rate of the allowance will be 16s. except when the contributor is drawing invalidity benefit. Then\t will be 15s.81. If there were a registration of dependants, as the Report suggests, itis doubtful whether, even if an accurate and complete registration at the start of the scheme were achieved, it would be possible to keep the register up todate. Persons in work might well fail to notify subsequent changes, i.e. whenpersons originally registered as dep endants ceased to be dependent or whenpersons not previously registered later became dependants. So, when claims to benefit were made, the register could not be taken as decisive one way orthe other, and there would be scarcely any advantage in compiling it.X-RETIREMENT pensions the Problem82. The prevention of want in old age is an objective of policy by which theGovernment set great store. But it involves a problem with certain specialfeatures, arising out of the fall in the birth-rate and the consequent rise inthe proportion of elderly people in the community. The Government Actuaryhas estimated that in the twenty years from 1945 to 1965 the population of pensioners over working age will grow from about 3,400,000 to 5,300,000, anincrease of about 1,900,000, whereas the number of contributors will be prac-tically stationary at about 21,000,000. In the next ten years, from 1965 to1975, there will be a further increase of about 800,000 in the pensioner popula-tion, while the contributing population will fall by over 1,000,000. Rather lessthan one half of the increase in the number of pensioners in the first twenty years is due to the gradual inclusion of the new classes who have to serve a qualifying period. The result of these changes is that, whereas in 1945 it isestimated that there will be 16 pensioners to every 100 contributors, there will,by 1975, be about 31 pensioners to every 100 contributors.83. This is the position as estimated on the assumption that the fertility anddeath rates of the immediate pre-war years will continue after the war. A.substantial improvement in longevity would materially add to the number of pensioners, thus increasing still further the proportion of pensioners to con-iributors. Any rise which might occur in the fertility rate would at once add to the cost of children&apos;s benefits, but it would enlarge the working populationonly after an interval, and could not make any appreciable difference to the ratio of pensioners to contributors in the years under review.Rate of Pension84. The proposal in the Report was that the rate of pension to be payabletwenty years from the start of the scheme would be fixed now, at 40s. (joint)and 24s. (single), and that contributions should be payable from the starton the basis of this ultimate rate. The rate of pension was, however, to startat 25s. (joint) and 14s. (single) and, for persons insured under the existing34532 a 7
scheme, would rise by increments of is. 6d. (joint) and is. (single) everysecond year until the full rate was reached at the end of twenty years. (for persons coming into pensions insurance at the start of the new scheme, therate of pension was to van,&apos; according to the year in which retirement tookplace, and once granted was to be fixed.)85. The Government have already announced that they cannot accept thes&apos;-proposals (even though from the taxpayers point of view they have attracted-tions because of the postponement of the main weight of expenditure), andthat, in their view, it is preferable that the new standard rate of pension, at whatever rate it may be fixed, should be payable from the time the new scheme comes into effect.86. The Government recognise the general desire of the country that proper provision should be made for old age, and they share it. But the steadyprospective increase over a period of years in the proportion of pensioners to people of working age makes it of particular importance to take a prudentview. In the result, tire Government find themselves unable to adoptpermanent rates of 40s. joint and 24s. single and propose rates of 35s. jointand 20s. single to take effect from the commencement of the new scheme.Pensionable age will be 65 for men and 60 for women.Increase of Pension: Postponement of Retirement87. A contributor need not, of course, retire on reaching pensionable age.Indeed, one of the results of the growth in the proportion of elderly people isthat it may well become a matter of vital importance to keep up the national income by encouraging the continuance of productive work by those who havereached pensionable age. In the war elderly people have turned to andserved the country well, in many active capacities, paid and voluntary. Inpeace, there may be a similar call upon their readiness and ability to play a constructive part in the national effort.88. The Government therefore propose that if anyone who has reachedpensionable age continues to work beyond that age, and retires and claimshis pension at a later age, the rate of pension will be increased by 2s. a week(joint) and is. a week (single) for each year of work after pensionable age.89. If a contributor who has once drawn a retirement pension again becomesemployed he will be exempt from payment of contributions, though his employer will have to pay the employees share. This means that he will notbe able to earn a higher pension by subsequent contributions.Joint Pension90. The joint pension of 35s. will be payable on the husband&apos;s retirement,provided that his wife is living with him or is wholly or mainly maintained byhim, and, if imder pensionable age, is not gainfully occupied. The jointpension will normally be paid to the husband but, where the wife is ofpensionable age and makes application for separate payment, a pension of 15s.will be paid to her and the husband&apos;s pension will be reduced to the singlerate of 20s. It is felt that such a division is justified on the ground that the pension is mainly provided from the husband&apos;s contributions and it would be inequitable to pay him a lower rate than that which the scheme provides fora single person.qi. Where a wife of pensionable age is living apart from her hueband andis not wholly or mainly maintained by him joint pension will not be payable on the husband&apos;s application. Pension will be payable to the husband at therate of 203., and, if application is made by the wife, a pension of 15s. will bepaid to her.,
g2. If a wife under pensionable age is gainfully occupied or is living apartfrom her husband and is no^ wholly or mainly maintained by him, a single-pension of 20s. will be payable to the husband, and no pension will be payable to the wife from his insurance.93. Where a wife has been insured in her own right she will be entitled,in retirement on or after age 60, to pension at the single rate for which hercontribution record qualifies her, whatever her husband&apos;s age and earnings.He also will be entitled, subject to his contribution record, to single pension on retirement at or after pensionable age. When a man has retired on pension,his wife, if she is entitled to pension in right of her own contributions, canlake either that pension, or the share of the joint pension to which she is entitled on her husband&apos;s record, whichever is the more favourable.Retirement Condition94. To qualify for pension a contributor must not only be of pensionable age and satisfy the contribution conditions; he must also have retired from work. When a contributor makes application for a pension, either on attainingpensionable age or later, he must make a declaration that he intends to retire from work. The date on which he intends to retire will normally be the date from which pension will be awarded. This does not mean, however, thathe may not work afterwards; he may do so whenever he likes, but his pension will be reduced for each week in which he has substantial earnings. earnings up to 20s. will be ignored, and the amount of earnings in excess of this figurewill be deducted from the week&apos;s pension based on his insurance (whether it isbeing paid jointly or separately). A wife&apos;s earnings will also be taken intoaccount if a joint pension of 35s. is being paid to the husband or if she isdrawing a separate pension in respect of his insurance, but the husband&apos;s share of a joint pension (or his pension, if separate pensions are being paid)will not be reduced on account of his wife&apos;s earnings. Each week, whendrawing his pension at the Post Office, the pensioner will have to declarewhether he (and, if necessary, his wife) has earned more than 20s. in theprevious week. If he has not, his pension will be paid in full by the PostOffice; if he has, and so cannot sign the declaration, the Post Office will not pay and the pensioner will report the amount of the earnings to the local social insurance Office, where the necessary adjustment to his week&apos;s pension willbe made.95. It must be accepted that there is a risk of abuse in such a plan andobviously in Class II (the self-emplo\&apos;ed) it is very difficult to ascertain pre-cisely either the fact of retirement or the amount of earnings except at thecost of investigations and inquisitions which would be regarded as beyond allreason.96. It will not be necessary to adjust the pension week by week in all caseswhere the pensioner is earning. If he obtains regular employment at a wageexceeding 20s. a week but not exceeding 55s. (where a joint pension is payable) or 40s. (where a single pension is payable) it will be possible to awarda pension at the appropriate reduced rate; he will then be required to declareeach week whether there has been any change in his earnings.(Contribution Conditions97. Primarily the rates of retirement pension are designed for contributorswho pay the new rates of contribution from their 16th birthday till their60th   (women)   or   65th   (men).    On   this   basis   no   contributor   couldclaim a pension until forty-four years after the start of the scheme; but34532- a s
pensions at the new rate will be paid from the commencement of the scheme.For the purpose of considering how the new scheme will be applied, con-distributors can be divided into the following groups:  A. Those who are less than 16 when the new scheme comes into operation.B. Those who are insured under the present scheme and have reachedpensionable age.C. Those who are insured under the present scheme but have not reachcpensionable age.D. Those who, though over age 16, are not insured under the present scheme but become contributors under the new one.Group A9S. (i) Initial Qualifying Contributions. The Government think it right-,in order to emphasise the contributory nature of an insurance benefit free froma needs test, to require the payment of a minimum of 156 actual contributionsas an initial qualifying condition.(ii) Yearly Average of Contributions paid or excused. Title to pension willbe determined by the record of contributions over the whole working life and a yearly average of 50 contributions paid or excused will be requiredto qualif5&apos; for the full rate of pension. This entails the maintenance of a liferecord of contributions for the whole insured population, a task which obviouslyraises formidable administrative problems, but, so far as can be foreseen,none that cannot be overcome. The requirement of a yearly average of50 contributions seems to the Government to give enough margin, especiallyin view of the fact that a contribution at Class I, II or IV rate (all of which include a pension contribution) is payable for every week in the year exceptin so far as excusai is granted, and, strictly speaking, there should be no margin at all.As the yearly average will normally be based on the number of contributions paid or excused from age 16 to 65 (60 for women), divided by the numberof contribution years in that period, the divisor (in this group) will be 49 fora man and 44 for a woman.99. Reduction of Pension: deficient contribution record. As pensionsinsurance extends to the whole body of insured persons irrespective of class,an insured person on attaining pension age should as a rule have a completecontribution record for the purposes of (ii) of the preceding paragraph. Ina minority of cases, however, the record will be deficient, e.g. a man in class II or^ Class IV may for some part of his working life have obtainedexemption from liability to contribute because of low income or a man may come from abroad and begin to contribute at an age over 16. Where theaverage yearly number of contributions throughout a. contributor s working life is less than 50, the rate of pension will be reduced. The following tableillustrates the arrangements provisionally suggested:_Rate of pensionAverage annual number of payableCOntriehrcuseni *** &quot; Si&apos;^-ercusecL-     s. d. /   s. d.50 or more      ............... 1 15. o 10045 and less than 50   ...      ...      ...       ... 1 n   6 iS   o40   .. .  ,,         45............ 180 16   o
Group Bioo. Those in this group will generally be in receipt of, or entitled to claim,an old age pension of ios. a week; but a few will not have fulfilled theconditions. Existing old age pensioners who have retired will have their pensions of ios. converted into retirement pensions at the full basic rates (seeoaragraph 86); if later they do any work, their earnings will not reduce theirension below ios. a week. If an old age pensioner has not yet retired, hewill continue fo draw his ios. a week until he decides to retire, when hewill get a retirement pension at the basic rate.Group Cioi. Those in this group will not be able to claim an old age pension ofios. a week on reaching pensionable age, but having reached that age theywill be eligible for retirement pensions when they decide to retire from work.The rates of pension and the retirement conditions, including postponement of retirement, will be the same for them as for group A. The contributionconditions (paragraph 98) will, however, be modified as follows:  (i) They must have been insured at least 5 years.(ii) They must have paid 104, not 156, actual contributions. (These twoconditions apply in the existing scheme.)(iii) They must have a yearly average of at least 50 contributions paid orexcused. It will, however, be impossible to apply this condition over thewhole working life, as the complete contribution record may not be available and insurance did not necessarily run from the 16th birthday. The testunder the permanent scheme will, therefore, be modified for this group by making it apply retrospectively to a period not exceeding 10 years beforethe start of the new scheme, and giving an appropriate credit for insurance and contributions in that period. This credit will ensure that the positionof persons who have a good record of contributions up to the start of thenew scheme will be fully safeguarded. If the average on this modifiedbasis falls below 50 the rate of pension will be reduced as shown inparagraph 99.Group D102. Those in this group will be required to contribute for 10 years beforebecoming eligible for retirement pensions. Otherwise, all the conditions which apply to group A will apply to this group except that the average number ofcontributions paid or excused will be calculated, not over the whole working life, but over the period from the date of the commencement of the new schemeto the date when the contributor reaches pensionable age or completes 10years insurance, whichever is later.103. Persons in this group who are within 10 years of pensionable age whenthe scheme commences will obviously be in a special position, since they will not be able to fulfil the necessary conditions until some time afterreaching pensionable age. For those who remain in employment until the10 years period has been completed, the contributions paid in respect of that employment -will count towards satisfying the contribution conditions for pension. Those who retire before the end of the 10 years will be given an option: they may either continue to pay contributions at the Class IV rate,after reaching pensionable age, in order to quality for retirement pension; 01they may claim a refund with interest oi the pension element of their share oicontributions which they have paid, and forgo any right to pension.
Non-Contributory Pensions104. Non contributory pensions of 10s. a week are at present payable to persons of 70 whose yearly means (after certain deductions) do not exceed 26 5s. od. If tire yearly means exceed this figure, the pension is reduced on a sliding scale. In the changed conditions created by the new scheme thereis no case for retaining these non-contributory pensions for persons under theage of 70 at its inception. Existing pensioners will receive the new rate o&apos;pension, subject to an appropriately adjusted means scale. Those aged 70and over when the scheme takes effect, who are not pensioners at that date(e.g. owing to excess of means), will remain eligible for, and will be entitled toreceive, any pension for which they may from time to time be qualified(e.g. through reduction of means).Sickness and Unemployment Benefit after Pensionable Age105. Where a person in Class I who has reached pensionable age remains atwork and then falls sick or becomes unemployed, sickness or unemploymentbenefit will not be payable at the normal rate, but at a rate equivalent to the retirement pension which would have been payable if he had retired when hebecame sick or unemployed. The same will apply to a person in Class IIwho falls sick.XI-MARRIED WOMENThe Housewife106. The last census showed that seven married women out of eight werenot in gainful occupation. Their primary need is, therefore, support when their husbands&apos; earnings are interrupted by sickness or loss of employment;and there are special needs in connection with maternity. The government propose to cover these needs and to relate the benefits substantially lo the hus-band&apos;s position in insurance.The Employed Married Woman107. In a minority of cases a woman re-enters or remains in employmentafter her marriage. Her position is then, in many respects, a special one.For one thing, if her employment is interrupted she still has her husband&apos;earnings to maintain the home. Again, experience of health and unemploy-ment insurance has shown that there are special difficulties attaching to theinsurance of married women. It is hard to be sure whether she is really in diefield of employment, and experience of this difficulty led to the introduc-tion of the Anomalies Regulations as a safeguard in respect of unemploy-ment benefit. Experience has also shown that there is in any event a higherincidence of sickness among married women, and this, taken in conjunctionwith the further fact that they have not the same inducement as single women to get back to work after a period of sickness, made it necessary to introduce a lower rate of sickness benefit for married women. For these reasons apossible course would be to exclude married women altogether from insur-ance. The Government do not propose to take this course; in some parts ofthe country a considerable proportion of married women engage in emplo&apos;-ment and have been in the habit of paying contributions and receiving benefits in their own right.Insurance or Exemption108. On marriage a woman insured before her marriage will be requiredto choose whether to be insured in her own right in whatever Class is appro-priate from time to time (i.e. Class I, II or IV), or to be exempt and rely on her husband&apos;s insurance.   In order, however, to confine insurance against
nsickness and unemployment to those whose employment is more than casual,married women earning- 20s. a week or less will be compulsoriiy exempt irominsurance in Class 1 or Class II.109. In view of the special position ol married women as stated in para-graph 107, the gainfully occupied married woman who remains m insurancewill receive sickness benefit, and (Class I only) unemployment benefit, at separately lower than the standard rate. And in this particular case there mustbe a departure irom the principle otherwise adopted, in that sickness benefit for insured married women will be at a lower rate dian unemployment benelit.no. It is not, however, proposed that the woman who chooses on marriageto be insured in hen own right should always start a fresh insurance life. Sub-ject to the special conditions referred to in paragraphs 112 to 114 she will retain her pre-rnarriage record.in. The reason for allowing a married woman to insure in Class IV is 10permit her to qualify for pension in her own right. There would be a strongease for this where, for example, a woman married a man who had recentlycome from abroad and could not build up sufficient contributions to enable him to qualify for more than a small pension.Special Conditions112. Two special conditions will be imposed. First, in order to retainher right to pay Class IV contributions and, if gainfully occupied, her quaii-fication for sickness or unemployment benefit, a married woman must have at least 45 contributions paid or excused in each contribution year. Second,a married woman will not be entided to a pension by virtue of her own insur-ance unless the total number of contributions paid or excused in any Classsince her marriage represents not less than one hah of the number of weekssince marriage.113. If a married woman who has dropped out of insurance re-enters gainfuloccupation and chooses to be insured again, she can requalify for sickness and unemployment benefit by 52 weeks of insurance and the payment of 26contributions. This will also restore to her the right to continue insurance for retirement pension by payment of Class IV contributions if she ceasesgainful occupation.114. A woman who is already married and insured on the day the schemecomes into operation will be able to choose insurance or exemption, but a married woman who was not insured immediately before the start of thescheme will be able to enter insurance only if she takes up gainful occupation.If she ceases gainful occupation after a substantial period of insurance shewill be allowed to insure in Class IV to preserve- her pension rights.115. These conditions may seem elaborate, and in some respects restrictive,but if a married woman is to be allowed to choose the course which suits herbetter it is necessary in the interests of insured persons generally to ensurethat she is not given a second chance to enter insurance except on strict con-ditions. The conditions here set out are no more than necessary to secure this end and are not in themselves unreasonable.Benefits116. The benefits which will be available to, or in respect of, marriedwomen are as follows :  (i) Sickness and Unemployment. For those who are not insured intheir own right there will be no benefit when the woman herself issick or unemployed, but when her husband is on benefit it will be paid atthe rate of 40s. instead of 24s., subject to his contribution record and to
the further conditions that the wife is living with him or maintained byhim and that she is not earning more than 20s. a week.(ii) For those who are insured in dieir own right and themselves qualify for sickness or unemployment benefit, benefits will be payable subject to theirown contribution records, at the following rates: sickness and invalidity,16s.; unemployment, 20s.(iii) Maternity Grant. There will be a maternity grant of  4 for alwomen, whether gainfully occupied or not.(iv) Maternity Benefit. There will be a maternity benefit at the rate of36s. a week for 13 weeks (covering a period before and after confinement)payable to all gainfully occupied married women, whether they are insuredin their own right or have chosen to be exempt.(v) Attendant&apos;s Allowance. For those who are not eligible for maternitybenefit, there will be an attendants allowance at the rate of  1 a week for four weeks. Its object is to assist in providing domestic help immediatelyafter childbirth.(vi) Benefit for wife not maintained, by husband. When a woman isliving apart from her husband and can obtain no financial assistance from him, benefits will be payable to her, in respect of her own contributions, asif she were single.(vii) Retirement and Widowhood. The benefits provided for marriedwomen are described in the sections of the Paper dealing with these subjects.Qualifying Conditions117. (i) Maternity Grant will be available to all married women and the qualifying conditions will be that the husband or the wife should (a) at some time have paid 26 actual contributions, and(6) have 26 or more contributions or excusals in the relevant contributionyear.(ii) Maternity Benefit will be available to all married women who are gain-fully occupied, whether or not they are exempt from insurance. It will be conditional upon the woman giving up for the time her gainful occupation.The other qualifying conditions will be as follows:  Married women who are in insurance must have had 26 weeks of gainfuloccupation, for which contributions were paid, in the twelve months beforethe beginning of benefit, and a substantial part of the balance of that twelvemonths must be covered by evidence of incapacity or inability to getemployment. Women in Class I who are exempt from paying contributions will qualify by contributions paid by the employer. An exempt person in class II has no employer and in her case the first condition will be satisfiediby evidence of ga&apos;nful occupation.(iii) Attendant&apos;s allowance; the qualifying conditions will be the same asthose for maternity grant.Other Benefits Considered118. The Government have considered whether there should be a grant payable to women on marriage; and also whether there should be a temporaryseparation benefit (akin to the benefit provided on the death of a husband)where, through no fault of her own, a wife loses maintenance to which sheis entitled from her husband.On the first, it has been calculated, to give an example, that a grant at therate of  1 for every 40 actual contributions before marriage, with a maximum
9/1XII.-WIDOWSBenefits121. The provision for widowhood made under the existing scheme (apartfrom allowances for dependent children) is a pension of ios. a week. Thispension is payaole throughout widowhood, however young a woman maybe when she is left a widow and whether or not she has dependent children.The Government feel that this provision does not properly meet the varyingneeds of widowhood at different ages and in differing circumstances andthat it must be revised so as to:  (i) provide temporary weekly payments at a relatively high rate to helpa widow in the period of economic readjustment which will normally followher husband&apos;s death (but see paragraph 122 (i));(ii) make special provision for the widow if she has dependent children;(iii) give a pension equal to retirement pension to a widow who hasbeen married or had the care of her children for a long time and who atthe time of her husband&apos;s death, or when her youngest child ceases to be dependant on her, has reached an age at which she may find it hard to take up paid work again.At the same time, the Government feel that, although accruing rights under existing schemes need not be preserved in all cases, it would not be fair to disregard them in the case of women married, at the start of the new scheme,to men insured for widows&apos; pensions under the existing scheme. The maininducement to the many thousands of voluntary contributors who entered thescheme was the provision which it held out for widowhood (see paragraph 126).122. The Government accordingly propose to introduce the followingbenefits:  (i) Widow&apos;s Benefit of 36s. a week payable for the first thirteen weeks ofwidowhood to women widowed before age 60, and to women widowedafter that age wnose husbands had not qualified for retirement pension..of  10, would require an extra 3d. a week in the contributions of all women in Classes I and II. The Government do not consider the benefit attractiveenough to justify this extra charge.On the second, the Government feel that the question whether loss ofmaintenance is the fault o  the wife is not one which should be determinedby a Department responsible for administering the social insurance scheme.The wife must seek other remedies open to her to secure maintenance.Anomalies Regulations119. Reference has been made in paragraph 107 to the AnomaliesRegulations. The mischief at which they were aimed is, in the governments view, a real one; but Ihey do not feel that special Regulations of this kind,which deal with an abuse prevalent in a particular class yet not peculiar to it,should be a feature oi a universal system oi social insurance. It is therefore proposed to abolish the Married Women Anomalies Regulations and instead to have general regulations intended to exclude from unemployment benefitthose who are not really available for employment, single people as well asmarried, and men as well as women.The Unmarried Mother120. Maternity grant, maternity benefit and attendants allowance will beavailable to single women on the same terms as for married, except that titlewill rest on the womaits own insurance.
If the widow of a man in Class I or Class II has no child within the qualifying age and is unfit for work when her right to widow&apos;s benefit ceases,she will while under pensionable age be entitled to sickness benefit of 24s.a week (or, after three years of incapacity, invalidity benefit of 20s.) so longas her illness lasts.(ii) Guardian&apos;s Benefit of 24s. a week, payable so long as the widow hasin her family at least one child within the qualifying age for family allowances.(iii) Widow&apos;s Pension of 20s. a week, payable to a widow who is aged50 or over when widowed or when she ceases to be entitled to guardian&apos;benefit, provided in cither case that she was married at least 10 years before.This pension will cease when replaced by a retirement pension.These benefits will terminate on remarriage.Contribution conditions.123. The contribution conditions to be satisfied by the husband for paymentof widow&apos;s benefit, guardian&apos;s benefit and widow&apos;s pension will be on thesame lines as for retirement pension (see paragraph 98).Conditions as to earnings and duplication of benefits.124. Guardian&apos;.; benefit and widow&apos;s pension will be reduced where earningsexceed 20s. weekly; a sliding scale on the same lines as for retirement pension(see paragraph 94) will be applied.Sickness or unemployment benefit, or training allowance (which will beavailable to widows in appropriate cases) will not be paid together withwidow&apos;s benefit, guardian&apos;s benefit or widow&apos;s pension.Transitional Classes125. Widow pensioners whose husbands died before the new schemestarts:- (i) If the widow has no child of the qualifying age for family allowance,she will keep her pension of 10s. a week. If, howrever, she has already reached the age of 60 at the start of the new scheme, she will, subject toretirement, have her 10s. pension replaced by a retirement pension of 20s.a week.(ii) If the widow has a child of the qualifying age, she will get guardian&apos;.?benefit. When guardian&apos;s benefit ceases she will have her pension of 10s.a week restored to her, unless, being then over 50, she is entitled to widow&apos;pension of 20s. a week.126. Women already married at start of uew scheme to men insured under existing scheme. Women in this category who become widows will be eligiblefor the benefits of the new scheme, i.e. widow&apos;s benefit, guardian&apos;s benefit,and the widow&apos;s pension of 20s. a week, if they have the qualifications for those benefits set out in paragraph 122 and if the contribution conditions setout below are satisfied. If, however, they have not those qualifications butthe contribution conditions are satisfied, they will be eligible for a pension of10s. a week, i.e. the equivalent of the widow&apos;s pension to which they wouldhave been entitled under the existing scheme.The contribution conditions to be satisfied by the husband in a case of thiskind will be:  (i) Initial qualifying contributions. A minimum of 104 actual contribu-tions paid since the husband last became insured.
(ii) Yearly average of contributions paid or excused. A yearly averageof 50 contributions paid or excused will be required, but credit will begiven for insurance prior to the start of the new scheme, on the same lines as for retirement pension (see paragraph 101 (iii)). If the averageis below 50, the rate of pension will be reduced.A pension of 10s. a week paid to a widow under the arrangements described in this or the preceding paragraph will not be reducible on accountof earnings; and if she is drawing guardian&apos;s benefit or widow&apos;s pension of20s. a week in place of the 10s. pension, that benefit or pension will notbe reducible below 10s. a week on account of earnings.127. Women married after new scheme starts to men insured under existing scheme.   The contribution conditions will be:  (i) Initial qualifying contributions. A minimum of 156 actual contribu-tions paid since the husband last became insured;(ii) Yearly average of contributions paid or excused. A yearly averageof 50 contributions paid or excused will be required, credit being given forpast insurance on the lines referred to in the last preceding paragraph.If these conditions are satisfied, widow&apos;s benefit, guardian&apos;s benefit, or\vidow&apos;s pension of 20s. a week will be payable to a widow otherwisequalified.128. Widows of men who become insured at the start of the new scheme.The contribution conditions will be the same as in the preceding paragraphexcept that the average will be calculated over the period from the start cfthe new scheme to the date of death.If these conditions are fulfilled, widow&apos;s benefit, guardian&apos;s benefit orwidow&apos;s pension of 20s. a week will be payable to a widow otherwisequalified.Position of Widows in Relation to Retirement Pension129. If a widow on reaching the age of 60 was entitled to either widow&apos;benefit, guardian&apos;s benefit or a wido\v&apos;s pension (other than a 10s. pension payable under the existing scheme or the transitional arrangements) she will,when her title to that benefit or pension ceases (otherwise than by remarriage),become entitled to a retirement pension based on her husband&apos;s insurance.130. A woman over 60 at the death of her husband will then or on cessation-tion (otherwise than by remarriage) of her right to widcw&apos;s or guardian&apos;benefit be entitled to a retirement pension based on her husband&apos;s insurance.131. There remains the case of the woman widowed under 60 who on reaching that age was not entitled to any of the widowhood benefits. Forcontributions relating to retirement pension, she may rely upon her ownrecord throughout, or on her husband&apos;s record up to the date of his death,and her own record thereafter, or on her own pre-mam?ge record, her husband&apos;s record during marriage, and her own record thereafter. (Wherethe widow has been married more than once, the relevant record will be thatof her last husband.) These arrangements will also apply to a woman whobetween the start of the new scheme and her 60th birthday qualifies fora 10s. pension under the transitional arrangements, but her retirement pension will not be reducible, on account either of earnings or deficient contributions,below 1 os.A widow who at the start of the new scheme is in receipt of a 10s. pension under the existing scheme must rely on her own contribution record through-out, but if she is then between 50 and 60, and will not have completed10 years insurance when she reaches 60, her title to retirement pension willbe based on her record from entry into insurance up to her 6otlt birthday.Her pension will not in any event be reduced below 10s,
XIII DEATH GRANTRates132. The Government propose to introduce a death grant as follows:   For those dying below 3 years of age     ............     6For those dying between 3 and 6   ...      ... ......   10.   For those dying between 6 and 18 ...      ...      ... 15For those dying over 18     ...      ...      ... ...   20133. As a transitional arrangement persons between the ages of 55 and 65at the beginning of the scheme will be eligible for a grant of only  10. Theage limit of 60 proposed in the Report would mean that a number of men over that age would contribute without any possibility of grant being paid.134. The Government further propose that the grant should not be availablefor children dying below the age of 10 unless they were born after the begin-ning of the scheme. Otherwise the total amount insured on the death of a child might be above the limit fixed by law.135. Contribution conditions will be such as to make it easy for persons to keep in benefit; they will be limited to those needed to establish that the deceased was in current insurance or was the wife or child of an insured person, or was a pensioner.Industrial Assurance136. The introduction of a death grant as part of the Social Insurancescheme makes it desirable to review such questions as insurance for indirectexpenses connected with funerals and these are being reserved for separateexamination.XIV-BENEFIT WHILE IN HOSPITAL137. Under the new National Health Service, treatment in hospital will beavailable without charge to any member of the community. This means thatordinary maintenance food, fuel and light, bedding and the various necessarypersoi-al services which can be distinguished from strict medical treatment will aiso be provided free of cost. Social insurance benefits, however, are alsodesigned to make substantial provision for ordinary maintenance. It thereforeseems reasonable that benefit should be adjusted when the recipient is in hospital.138. The Government propose that the rate of benefit during maintenance in hospital should be 10s. a week less than the standard rate (ordinary sick-ness benefit, instead of being at the rate of 40s. for a married coupleor 24s. for a single person, would become 30s. for a couple or 14s. fora single person). Except in the case of joint retirement pension, the reduced rate will be paid only when the person entitled lo benefit is himself (or herself)in hospital, and not when his (or her) dependant is in hospital. If, while a man is on sickness or unemployment benefit, his wife goes into hospital, thestandard rate of benefit will be paid.139. This special rate of benefit will take effect after the 28th day in hospital.Payment of benefit at the standard rate for the first 28 days is proposed inview of the additional expense usually incurred on going into hospital, andof the need in many cases for making temporary domestic arrangements. Assickness benefit will not be paid to a person in Class II until the illness haslasted for four weeks, the 28 days will, in his case, be reckoned from the endof the fourth week of illness or from the date of going into hospital, whichever is the later.
In calculating the 28 days, periods in hospital separated by a short interval(still to be fixed) will be treated as continuous.140. The special rate will be applied to the following benefits: sickness andinvalidity benefit, maternity benefit, widow&apos;s benefit, guardian&apos;s benefit,widow&apos;s pension and retirement pension.141. Since family allowances are intended to be a general contribution to theneeds of families with children, no reduction will be made in family allow-ances while a child is in hospital; nor will a 5s. family allowance be paid tothe authorities of any hospital (or other institution) in which a child is being maintained.142. There.are special considerations affecting old persons who are being maintained in institutions or homes for reasons other than sickness. Thearrangements for them are under consideration.XV-TREATMENT OF THE BLIND143. Under the proposed insurance scheme most blind persons will havebeen insured before the onset of blindness and they will therefore on the usualconditions become entitled to sickness or invalidity benefit if their blindnessprevents them from working, and to retirement pensions at the appropriateage.144. The Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944, which will be broughtinto operation at the appropriate stage in the transition from war to peace conditions, is designed to facilitate the employment of disabled persons gener-ally (including the blind), and will mean that fewer blind people will have to rely on insurance benefit or assistance. Employers will be required to employ a quota of disabled persons under ordinary conditions, some classes of cmploy-ment will be reserved for the disabled, and workshops will be established underthe control of the Ministry of Labour and National Service to provide employ-ment under sheltered conditions for those who are so severely disabled thatthey could not otherwise get employment. The Ministry of Labour can make payments to any voluntary association or local authority or any speciallyestablished company for expenses incurred by them in providing, under arrangements made with the Minister, special facilities for the employment ofdisabled persons.145. In these new circumstances the Government propose that the respon-sibility for cash payments to the blind, other than insurance benefits and remuneration for employment, should rest on the central Department respon-sible for administering National Assistance; that the general responsibility forother special welfare services for the blind should remain with the localauthorities; and that the system of paying non-contributory pensions to the blind should be brought to an end. Persons who have blind pensions whenthe new scheme starts will keep these; and the rate of pension may be increasedfor them as for other non-contributory pensioners.   (See paragraph 104.)146. These arrangements are in line with the proposals in the Report, whichrecommended in addition a special system of partial incapacity allowances.Apart from the difficulty of assessing the degree of incapacity of people only partially disabled by blindness, the Government see no need to institute aspecial system of allowances for partial incapacity. A blind person who is wholly incapable of work will normally be entitled to sickness or invaliditybenefit; if he is only partially incapable he will get sheltered employment; andif his benefit in the one case, or his earnings in the other, are not sufficient forhis needs, he will be able to get additional help in the form of national assistance.
XVI DUPLICATION OF BENEFITSWith other Social Insurance Benefits147. Not more than one social insurance benefit or pension will be payable to an individual at any one time. Where there is title, to more than one, thelarger will be paid, e.g. maternity benefit instead of sickness benefit. Onthe other hand, a grant or allowance will be payable in addition to benefit,e.g.- maternity grant as well as maternity benefit.With War and Industrial Pensions148. It is difficult to determine in what circumstances and within whatlimits those receiving war or industrial pensions or allowances should beallowed to draw social insurance benefits for which they may qualify.149. The Government consider that some adjustment will be necessary wherethe same person is eligible both for a war or industrial pension or allow-ance and for an insurance benefit, but at this stage it is not practicable topropound a solution for all the different types of case that may arise.150. The case for adjustment is strongest in relation to dependants&apos; benefits.A pension given to a war or industrial pensioner may be given for a variety of reasons, including deprivation of personal capacity for enjoyment of a fulllife; the position of his dependants who have sustained no impairment is different and, if he is drawing a larger pension because of tiieir existence, other benefits to which he may also be entitled need not also include a supplementin respect of them. To some extent, the same argument holds as regardsa woman who, although widowed by war or industrial accident, is notherself disabled. Further, it does not follow that any solution which is accepted for the pensioner himself in regard to short-term benefits should necessarily be applied to the long-term benefits.151. Adjustment may also be required in those more specialised cases whenillness, for instance, occurring in later life, can clearly be attributed in wholeor in part to an earlier war or industrial injury for which a pension is being paid. *XVII ADMINISTRATIONMinister of Social Insurance152. The Government have announced their intention of consolidating theadministration of a comprehensive insurance scheme in one organisation. Theyreserved the question whether the organisation should be a new ministry or an administrative Board. But they are satisfied that the most effec-tive and the quickest way to bring the scheme as a whole into final legislativeform, and to secure its smooth running during the difficult transitional period,will be to appoint at this stage a Minister of Social Insurance. This Ministerwiii be responsible for the legislative and other preliminary work in launchingthe new insurance scheme; and, as it is essential that he should in this taskhave freely at his disposal the resources and assistance of staffs experienced in the organisation and administration of national insurance, the government propose to transfer to the new Minister responsibility for the existing schemesof social insurance. This transfer will not disturb the existing arrangementsfor payment of benefit under these schemes, which will continue until thenew scheme is operating.153. The organisation outlined above is framed to meet the position atthe beginning of the new scheme. When the scheme is in operation, andadministrative policy clearly defined and established, the position will be
reviewed. At that stage it may well be found that some other form of adminis-trative organisation is more suitable or that some rearrangement of central machinery may be desirable.154. Responsibility for the bringing into operation and administration ofthe Family Allowances scheme will also be assigned to the Minister of social insurance.( 155- The present work of the Assistance Board is closely associated with thepensions and unemployment insurance schemes, responsibility for which willbe transferred to the new Minister, and the Government propose that Minis-terial responsibility for the Board&apos;s work should be placed on him.156. The question whether it is desirable to establish a Social insurance statutory Committee on the lines of the present Unemployment insurance statutory Committee must be reserved for decision when the plan of thenew organisation is nearer finality.Local Offices157. Under the new scheme a wide network of local offices will beestablished at which the public may lodge claims, seek information 01guidance, and obtain payment of certain benefits. Sickness benefit will be payable, according to the claimants choice, either by postal draft or in cashat the local office to a deputy appointed by him, but where in the circum-stances of his case neither of these methods is appropriate it will be paid in cash at his home. For some benefits it will be more convenient for payment to be made through the agency of other Departments, e.g., the Post office for pensions and the Employment Exchanges for unemployment benefit.Employment Exchanges158. The Report proposed that the task of placing people in work should either be transferred from the Ministry of Labour and National Service to aMinistry of Social Security or at any rate be conducted at the local SecurityOffices. In the Governments view neither of these suggestions would be right.Unemployment benefit is designed merely to fill a temporary gap in wage-earning employment. The latter should represent the insured person&apos;s normalcondition. The employment service fulfils two functions: it helps the workerto secure suitable employment and it enables industry to obtain labour as quickly as possible. There must be a close connection between paying unem-ployment benefit and placing people in work, but to make the organisationof the latter dependent on that of the former would be to put the emphasisin the wrong place. The employment service should remain in the Employ-ment Exchanges and under the Ministry of Labour.XVIII NATIONAL ASSISTANCE159. It has been stated that when the new insurance scheme is in operationthere will be in reserve the National Assistance scheme to meet the require-ments of the specialty necessitous case. The Government propose that thescope of National Assistance (now confined broadly to persons in receipt of old age pensions, widow pensioners with children and able-bodied persons normallyemployed in insurable occupations) should be extended to include financialassistance to all on proof of need; and that the administration of national assistance should be centralised in one Department.160. Detailed proposals for bringing to an end the present system of publicassistance are being worked out and will include any necessary adjustments of the existing provisions relating to the &quot; disregard &quot; of certain types of
XIX-AGENCY ARRANGEMENTS FOR PAYING BENEFITSickness Benefit162. The Government fully recognise the value of the services rendered byApproved Societies in the development of the National Health Insurancescheme, and they have given the most careful and sympathetic considerationto the possibility of retaining the services of the Societies in some form inthe administration of the new &quot;scheme.They have not overlooked the considerations that if voluntary and Stateinsurance were administered by the same body it would help the developmentof voluntary insurance and possibly secure some diminution in administrative costs.163. On the question of the continuance of Societies as independent financialunits nothing has emerged to modify the views tentatively expressed by theGovernment in the debates in 1943, that there is no place for such bodies in a unified insurance scheme providing equal benefits for uniform compulsorycontributions.164. On the question of the employment of Societies as agents, the Govern-ment have examined closely the alternatives of retaining them either as responsible agents taking decisions and authorising payments, or simply aspaying agents acting on directions from the Central Authority, but have found each of the alternatives open to weighty objections. Certain proposals(involving substantial modifications of the existing structure of Societies)made by organisations of Approved Societies, have been given very carefulconsideration, but the Government cannot find in them any satisfactory solution of the major difficulties which are inherent in any project for indirectadministration.resources. It suffices here to say that the health functions of the publicassistance authorities will be merged in the new National Health Service;that the care and maintenance of orphaned and deserted children will remain within the sphere of local government, as will the provision of accommoda-tion for such old persons as need it. On the other hand, the duty will beplaced on the Assistance Board of making suitable provision for those, otherthan the sick, the young and the old, for whom assistance in cash is no&apos;appropriate. The Board will also be given the functions of the Customs anuExcise Department in respect of non-contributory pensions, so far as theycontinue.161. The Government consider that ultimate responsibility for both ihsur-ance and assistance should rest upon a single Minister; but in actual adminis-tration they attach grea: importance to the preservation of the distinctionbetween insurance and assistance, and it is proposed to retain in the final arrangements separate administration for Social Insurance and National Assist-ance. It is true that insurance benefit arises as of right and that assistance is available only subject to proof of need and examination of means and thatthis is an important distinction in itself, but the Government doubt whether,if both are dealt with by the same staff, the distinction would be sufficientlypreserved. Any overlapping of inspections or visits or duplication of staffscan be avoided by providing for agency arrangements between departments as at present, e.g., a man who now exhausts his right to unemploymentbenefit and has to have recourse to assistance, draws the actual payments,after his case has been examined and assessed by the officers of the assistance board, in the same way as he would have drawn unemployment benefit.
2165. In the result, therefore, they have been reluctantly forced to theconclusion that it is not practicable to retain Approved Societies as agentson any basis, and that the only sound course is to administer benefits solelythrough the Social Insurance &quot;Department. In view of the importance ofthe matter, it has been thought desirable to set out in detail the considerations which have led the Government to this conclusion, and these are given inVppendix II, together with a summary of the alternative proposals made inthe Report and of the wider proposals submitted on behalf of the approved societies.166. The Social Insurance Department will work largely through local offices and will thus maintain close contact with the insured population. TheGovernment are satisfied that, with the number of persons who have hadpractical experience in administering the existing health and unemploymentinsurance schemes and other social services, the Department will be able toobtain an adequate staff of officers of the right type and suitable qualifica-tions to whom the necessary measure of responsibility can be entrusted, andso to provide a service that will be efficient and in accord with the needs and convenience of insured persons.Unemployment Benefit167. The Government have at the same time decided that the payment ofState unemployment benefit through Trade Unions in accordance with Sec-tion 68 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1935, cannot any longer bejustified and they propose to abolish that arrangement. Nor, in abolishing the special schemes of Unemployment Insurance for the banking and insur-ance industries, do the Government propose that the organisations which haveadministered those schemes should act as agents for the payment of unem-ployment benefit.XX.-THE FINANCE OF THE SCHEME168. The finance of the scheme is explained fully in a Memorandum by theGovernment Actuary which forms Appendix I to this Paper. The Memo-randum gives in detail the contributions to be paid for the various classes and shows how they have been arrived at. It also contains a series of tablesshowing the estimated cost of the scheme at different dates, and the distributionof the load as between the contributor and the general taxpayer. The Memo-randum is one which requires study as a whole but there are certain outstandingfeatures which should be mentioned here.Tripartite Scheme of Contribution169. The method of financing the scheme by contributions from the bene-beneficiaries, their employers (where they have one) and the Exchequer, which hasbeen an essential feature of British Social Insurance, is being continued.For the main benefits (except unemployment benefit) five-sixths of thenecessary contribution will be derived from the insured person and his employer(if he has one) and one-sixth from the Exchequer. For unemployment benefit the contribution will continue to be shared equally between the employedperson, his employer and the Exchequer.In addition the Exchequer bears the cost of admitting the existing populationof all ages to the same benefits as are given to those who enter at age 16and pay contributions throughout their working lives.National Health Service170. Towards the cost of the National Health Service insured men andwomen will contribute iod. and 8d. a week respectively.  Of this the employer

The estimated expenditure on retirement pensions, which is included under the heading &quot; Social insurance benefits &quot; in the Table is as follows:    millions   millions1945   ......   169 1965   ......   2721955   ......   203 1975......   324It will be seen that from 1955 onwards the continuous increase in the rateof total expenditure is more than accounted for by the growth in pensioncharges.Comparison with Cost of Existing Schemes173. For purposes of comparison the approximate cost of the existing social insurance schemes and allied services may be put at about  411 imliions in1945. This would be the position on the basis that stabilised post-war conditions applied in that year. It is estimated that if the new scheme were inforce in that year the total cost would be  650 millions.The extra cost of the new scheme would therefore be about  240 millions and this would be attributable in more or less equal shares to the increase inthe pension rates, the raising of the rates of other insurance benefits, the new scheme of family allowances and the enlarged National Health Service.174. If the existing schemes were in operation in 1945 it is estimated thatthe charge to be met by taxation or local rates would be  278 irrillions. Ifthe new scheme were in operation in that year it is estimated that the charge to be so met would be  352 millions.  Thus at the outset the increased cost of(where there is one) pays rid. This figure of lid. represents approximately the amount which the employer at present contributes towards the cost of medical benefit and has been adopted for that reason.Cost of the Scheme171. The following Table shows the estimated income and expenditure ofthe new scheme at ten-yearly intervals. The year 1945 has been taken fo^convenience of comparison and it has been assumed for this purpose tha.stabilised post-war conditions will apply in that year. It will be appreciated that the scheme cannot in fact be in operation in that year; nor could the assumed stabilisation by then have been realised.
the new scheme to the Exchequer and local rates is estimated at  74 millions.It is not possible at the present time to allocate this increase of  74 millionsbetween the Exchequer and local rates.175. The estimates given in the Government Actuary&apos;s Memorandum donot take any account of the Governments proposals under the scheme of family Allowances to increase substantially the benefits given in kind to( hildren. These proposals, as stated in paragraph 51 of this Paper, are estimatedultimately to involve expenditure of the order of  60 millions a year in theprovision of meals and milk for children at school. This is exclusive of theprovision for children under school age, for which no estimate can at present be given. Nor do the estimates in the Government Actuary&apos;s Memorandumtake account of the proposals referred to in paragraph 71 of this Paper fortraining allowances to unemployed people who take courses of approvedtraining. As stated in that paragraph, the cost of these allowances will bemet from the proceeds of taxation and although an annual contribution fromthe Social Insurance Fund of an amount not exceeding  500,000 will be made,this is no index of the prospective cost of the training scheme to public funds.Financial Adjustment with Local Authorities176. The introduction of the new scheme will involve a financial adjustmentbetween the Exchequer and local rates on account of a number of services,particularly the National Health Sen-ice and Public Assistance, and also theschool meals and milk service. Until this adjustment has been worked outafter discussion with local authorities, it is not possible to make an allocation of the charges failing respectively on taxes and on local rates.Estimate of Unemployment177. It wall be seen from paragraph 8 of the Government Actuary&apos;s Memo-randum that the Government have instructed him to assume, for the purposeof framing his financial estimates, a notional figure of 8J per cent, of insuredpersons out of work. This needs explanation. It does not mean that theGovernment expect that year in year out this will be the percentage figure ofunemployment; they hope it will be lower. But in framing estimates, assump-tions have necessarily to be made and in making the calculations for a schemeof such magnitude it was thought a matter of financial prudence to assumed figure of 81 per cent.Assets of Existing Schemes178. The inclusion in the estimated income of the new scheme (see table VI in the Memorandum by the Government Actuary) of a sum of 15 millions on account of interest on existing funds is based on the settingfree of sums amounting to some  550 millions which, at the start of the new scheme, will be standing to the credit of the existing National Health insurance funds, pensions accounts, and unemployment fund. Of this amount, approxi-mately  245 millions represent moneys in the National Health Insurance fundsconsisting chiefly of the assets of Approved Societies.179. Under the Governments proposals social insurance will no longer be administered through a number of independent financial entities and it willbe unnecessary therefore to accumulate actuarial reserves for any part of thescheme. The funds which stand to the credit of Approved Societies consist mainly of the reserves, accumulated over a long period, which would havebeen required under the existing system to enable the individual societies tomeet in future their statutory liabilities to their present members; though to a minor extent also they comprise surplus funds which would in due course have become available for the provision of additional benefits over a limited period.
i8o. In view of the substantial increase in the rates and scope of benefits under the new scheme, and having regard to the fact that persons of all agesat the outset will pay the same contributions for these extended benefits asfuture entrants at age 16 (involving a substantial liability on the fund, whichwill fall on the Exchequer), the Government propose that the whole of the sums standing to the credit of the existing funds should be merged in thenew fund from which the social insurance benefits will be provided in future.XXI-TRANSITIONAL PROBLEMS181. Various transitional problems affecting contributors and beneficiarieswill inevitably arise on the introduction of a comprehensive insurance scheme.182. The transitional arrangements for retirement pensions and widow&apos;sbenefits are set out in this Paper. There will, however, be a number of othersand in view of their complexity their solution will have to wait until thescheme has taken final form. It is not at the moment possible to say morethan that in the preparation of a nation-wide scheme of social insurance, whichmust of necessity undergo many changes in its development, it would be neither practicable nor desirable to lay down a hard and fast rule that allaccruing rights must be safeguarded on each occasion of change. This would produce so many transitional provisions as to make change almost impossible.183. It will also be necessary at a later stage to work out in detail thearrangements for transferring functions from the existing agencies which it isnot proposed to utilise in the new scheme, and for winding them up.XXII-LEGISLATION184. As a first step the Government propose to introduce legislation at theearliest possible moment to set up a Ministry of Social Insurance and totransfer to that Ministry responsibility for the existing social insurance schemes. The next step will be a Bill dealing with family allowances, but itis intended that the coming into operation of the scheme should be deferredtill after the war.185. The Bill to implement the scheme of comprehensive social insurancewill inevitably be a measure of great length and complexity. Subject, ofcourse, to the discussion by Parliament of the proposals set out in this paper, it is intended to press on with the preparation of the Bill and tointroduce it as soon as possible.XXIII-CONCLUSION186. In conclusion the Government wish to place on record their gratitude to Sir William Beveridge for the great work which he did in preparing hiscomprehensive and imaginative Report. Their main tribute is the emoodi-ment of so much of his plan in the proposals set out in this White Paper -proposals which will, in their belief, afford an adequate basis of social insur-ance for many years to come.They round off a notable chapter in the history of British social insurance,which since its beginning thirty-three years ago in the National Insurance act of 1911 has grown steadily in scope and thoroughness. When the schemehere outlined, with such adjustments as parliamentary debate and public dis-cussion may suggest, is given the force of law, provision will have beenmade against every one of the main attacks which economic ill-fortune canlaunch against individual well-being and peace of mind. Social insuranceis but a means to achieving positive effort and abundant living. Yet it isa necessary means. When the new scheme is in operation it will be for thenation to respond by a fresh outburst of that creative energy which hasmarked the greatest periods of our history and is vitally necessary in theyears now before us.

Unemploy-ment benefit is payable for not more than 30 weeks of &quot; linked-up &quot; unem-ployment (subject to the provision regarding additional days for persons witha good record) and when exhausted may be followed by payments under national assistance. Spells of sickness or of unemployment are &quot; linked-up &quot;if separated by less than 3 months.Retirement pension is payable at age 65 (men) or 60 (women) or later, oncessation of work. Deferment of pension, and payment of further insurance contributions after the pensionable age, entitles the pensioner to an increase ofis. a week (2s. in a joint pension) for each further year&apos;s contributions paid.Benefits to Widows(i) Widow&apos;s benefit at 36s. a week (with the addition of 5s. if she has oneor more dependent children) for the first 13 weeks of widowhood; followedeither by(ii) Guardian&apos;s benefit at 24s. a week (plus 5s. for the first child) if, and for so long as, she has dependent children, and ividow&apos;s pension at 20s. a weekAPPENDIX memorandum by the Government Actuary on the Finance of theGovernments proposals in this memorandum the value of the social insurance benefits is expressedin terms of contributions, and estimates are given of the expenditure and income in a series of future years, under the Governments proposals in Part Iof the White Paper on Social Insurance.Summary of the proposals . For convenience of reference the cash benefits payable under the Govern-ments proposals to or in respect of a person aged 18 or over (referred to herc-herein after  as an adult) insured as a contributor in Class I, i.e., a person normallyworking for an employer, are summarised below.
on termination of guardian&apos;s benefit if she is then over 50 and not less than10 years have elapsed since marriage; or by(iii) Widow&apos;s pension at 20s. a week if (having no dependent children) she-was over 50 at widowhood and had been married for not less than 10 years.Maternity Benefits(i) Maternity grant of  .\ to all married women and to other women whtare contributors in any Class.(ii) Maternity benefit at 36s. a week for 13 weeks to gainfully occupiedwomen, whether paying contributions or exempt.(iii) Attendants allowance at 20s. a week for 4 weeks to married women who are not gainfully occupied and to other women who are contributorsin Class IV.Death Grant(i) On death of an adult, whether a contributor, wife or dependant: a payment of  20.(ii) On death of a dependant or contributor under age iS: if under 3 years, 6; between 3 and 6,  10; between 6 and iS,  15.Title to benefit or pension at the full rate depends in most cases on the satisfaction of certain contribution qualifications by the person on whoseinsurance the payment arises. Further, in the early years of the scheme,pension and widows&apos; benefits and grants on death will be subject to special conditons under transitional arrangements.2. Persons falling into Class II, viz., those following a gainful occupationbut not working for an employer, arc insured for the same benefits as Class Iexcept that (i) they are not eligible for unemployment benefit and (ii) they receive sickness benefit only from the fifth week of illness, with modifications in the case of residence in hospital. Persons of working age (other thanmarried women) who are not gainfully occupied are compulsorily insured in class IV but are not eligible for sickness and unemployment benefits.3. Forming part of the Governments proposals, but not among the social insurance benefits, are the universal schemes for a national health service,family allowances and national assistance. The health service does not include any benefits by way of cash payments and is relevant to this memor-andum only in that (i) a contribution towards the cost of the service is to be part of the social insurance contribution, and (ii) its total cost falls to bebrought within an3&apos; budget covering the expenditure under the various headsof social insurance and allied services. Similarly, such a statement should include the cost of the family allowances at the rate of 5s. a week for everychild under age 15 (or up to 31st July following age 16 if the child is at school) except the first such child in a famih/ and the cost of national assist-ance payments, which supplement social insurance benefits, or take their place where they are not payable, according to the individual needs of the recipient.4. The estimates included in this memorandum do not cover the proposed new scheme for industrial injury insurance which is to take the place of thepresent workmen&apos;s compensation scheme. This is being dealt with separately -ateiy, except that the requisite contribution for employed persons will beincluded with the social insurance contribution in a single stamp.5. Contributions, at the rate for the appropriate Class, are payable com-pulsorily by all persons (except married women) aged between 16 and theminimum pensionable age of 60 (women) or 65 (men) and by persons over the
pensionable age who continue at work. Payment of contributions is excused(i.e., for certain purposes they count for benefit as if paid) to full-timestudents, to unpaid apprentices and to persons who are unemployed (if in class I) or sick (if in Class I or II) or in receipt of the weekly maternitybenefit (if a woman in Class I or II) or widow&apos;s or guardian&apos;s benefit (if a widow in Class IV). Exemption from payment of contributions may belaimed by persons in Class II or IV whose total income is less than  75a year but the unpaid contributions are not excused, i.e., they are notdeemed to have been paid in assessing rights to benefit. Special options asto payment of contributions and special conditions as to compulsory exemptionin certain circumstances apply to married women only.The appropriate rates of contribution for the several Classes are set out below, their basis being described in the following paragraphs:  Weekly Rates of Contribution for Social Insurance and Health Service	Class I			Cla-s II	Class IV	Insured Person	Employer	Total		Men Aged 18 and over ... Between 16 and 18 Women Aged 18 and over ... Between 16 and 18	s. d. 3   7 2   34 1 10 1 11	s. d. 2 10 1 iii 2   3 1   6	s. d. 6   5 4   3 5    1 3. 5	s. d. 4    2 2   9 3   6 2   5	s. d. 3   4 2     2 2   8 1 10It is to be noted that, when the contributions to be charged under the separate scheme for industrial injury insurance, viz., 6d. for men and 4d.for women aged 18 and over, are added, the total rates of contribution for adults in Class I will be 6s. nd. for men and 5s. 3d. for women, of whichthe insured person&apos;s share will be 3s. iod. for men and 3s. for women. Indie case of contributors under the age of 18 the contributions for industrial injury insurance are 3d. for boys and 2d. for girls, shared equally betweenthe insured person and the employer; the total rates of contribution forthese persons will thus be 4s. 6d. and 3s. 7d., of which the insured person&apos;3share will be 2s. 5d. for boys and 2s. for girls.Actuarial Basis of the Estimates6. In the estimates which follow I have made use of the most recent pre-war data relating to mortality, marriage and other vital statistics, and have assumed the maintenance, after the war, of fertility rates and death rates atthe immediate pre-war level. I have not allowed for an increase in longevityin the future which might substantially affect the cost of pensions in later years or for a change in the fertility rate (either upward or downward)which would affect the cost of family allowances at once and, in due course,the other items of expenditure as well as the contribution receipts. Itis not to be understood from this that in my considered view stabilisationat pre-war levels represents the most probable trend over the period to whichthe estimates relate but that, for the particular purpose of these estimates and in view of the uncertainties due to the war, it has been thought better to adopt the assumption indicated rather than to allow for conjecturalmodifications of recent experience or to prepare estimates on alternativebases, either of which courses would appear inappropriate at the present time.
7. As regards sickness benefits I have assumed that sickness claims* will beat rates averaging I2  per cent, above those adopted in the present national health insurance scheme, having deemed it essential, in view of the funda-mental changes from the existing scheme, to provide for an appreciably higherclaim rate than diat prevailing hitherto. Two factors should be mentioned:first, there has been a considerable increase of sickness claims of short dura-tion during the course of the war and, secondly, the scale of benefits proposed(including dependants&apos; allowances) is substantially higher than the exist-ing benefits of the national health insurance scheme. While I have taken the favourable view that the current heavy sickness is a result of war-time diffi-culties and will gradually pass away, I have thought it right to make some allowance for the second factor mentioned. The addition I have made tothe sickness rates deduced from the experience of the past, under materiallydifferent conditions, is, however, of moderate amount and if it is not to be&apos;exceeded a high standard of medical certification will be essential, as wellas the active co-operation of the insured persons themselves, supported byadequate arrangements for med;cal referees and sick visiting.8. In fixing the contribution for unemployment benefit, and assessing thecorresponding expenditure, I have assumed that, on average, 8  per cent,of insured persons will be out of work at any time, i.e., an over-all rateof unemployment among the population in Class I corresponding to io percent, for the occupations covered by the present general scheme of unemploy-ment insurance. This notional basis has been adopted on the instructions of the Government.The proportion of the unemployed who will qualify for benefit is affected bythe maximum limit of 30 weeks of linked-up benefit (modified by the addi-tional period allowed to persons with a good contribution record in thepreceding five years) and must depend on the composition of the register asregards incidence and duration of unemployment under the assumed con-ditions. I have adopted the following proportions, viz., 721- per cent, entitledto benefit and 20 per cent, granted assistance, the balance of 7^ per cent,comprising persons who are disentitled to benefit or have exhausted benefitrights and do not or cannot claim assistance.9. Where the element of compound interest enters into a calculation, as inthe rates of contribution, a rate of 3 per cent, per annum has been assumed.The general lines adopted in the assessment of the rates of contribution,and the actuarial bases of the estimates, are the same as those followed in thepreparation of financial estimates in connection with the proposals of sir william Beveridge&apos;s Report on Social Insurance and Allied Services, which involved similar actuarial considerations; a fuller account of these is given inAppendix A to that Report (Cmd. 6404).Rates of Contribution10. On the bases indicated in the preceding paragraphs I have estimated thevalue of the social insurance benefits in terms of the weekly contribution which would be required during the whole of his working lifetime in orderto provide, for an entrant at the age of 16, the full cost of the benefits towhich he and his dependants will become entitled: this has been termed the* It should be noted that under the Government proposals, as under the existing national health insurance scheme, sickness and invalidity benefits are not pavable during periods of incapacity due to industrial injury or disease&apos;. The rates of sickness used incomputing the cost of sickness and invalidity benefits have due regard to this fart. in assessing the loss of contributions during sickness, however, the sickness rates have beenappropriately increased to allow for the fact that the payment of contributions is excusedduring any period of total incapacity, including that due to industrial injurv or disease.
full actuarial contribution. The contribution thus assessed has been thoughtin the past to represent a fair basis for determining subject to any relief which may be afforded by the Exchequer the joint rates of contribution tobe charged to the insured and their employers.In the case of long-term benefits (pensions, sickness, etc.; the contributionsproposed to be charged represent five-sixths of the full actuarial contributions,he State thus assuming liability for the remaining one-sixth. This does not,however, represent the full liability of the Exchequer for such benefits since,owing to a flat rate of contribution being charged for persons of all ages atthe outset, there is a deficiency in the case of persons not previously insured(mainly in Classes II and IV) and to a less extent owing to the accumulation of some reserves in the past in the case of persons now insured for health and pensions insurance, which will fall ultimately to be met by the State. Inaddition, the Exchequer assumes liability for the cost of raising existingpensions to the new rates. The method by which the State will meet itsliabilities under these heads is discussed in paragraph 30 below.11. A brief statement is necessary of the general basis on which the costof the various benefits has been allocated between men and womenrespectively in the determination of the rates of contribution.As regards retirement pensions, the women&apos;s contribution is assessed at thesum which, if paid by all women up to pension age, would meet the costof the pensions to which women become entitled at or after age 60, whether as the wives or widows of insured men or on their own insurance as singleor married women or widows. In this calculation account is taken of thefact that a wife&apos;s pension is 15s. and not 20s., unless she is entitled to pension on her own insurance, and of the postponement of grant of pensionafter age 60 where the wife is not at least 5 years younger than her husband.The man pays for his own pension and for that portion of pensions towives (and widows over age 60) which is left unprovided for because mostwomen on marriage cease to pay contributions.The whole cost of widows&apos; and guardians&apos; benefits up to age 60 (includingthe allowance in respect of the first child in a family) and the contributoryportion of orphans&apos; allowances (see paragraph 21 below) is placed upon themen&apos;s contributions.In the case of unemployment benefit the relative contributions of men andwomen have been assessed by apportioning the total cost of unemploymentbenefit, including dependants&apos; allowances, in proportion to the averagerates of benefit (plus allowances) for adults of each sex. For men thismeans taking into account the average value of the supplements for wives,adult dependants, and the first child in a family; for women it involves onlythe value of the supplements for adult dependants of insured women, theaverage amount of which is very small.The contributions for sickness and invalidity benefits are related to thevalue of the benefits to contributors of each sex respectivelv, including as inthe case of unemployment benefit the allowances for wives and otherdependants.The cost of the weekly maternity benefit to gainfully occupied womenhas been placed upon the contributions of women in Classes I and II, whilstexpenditure on the other maternity benefits, i.e., the lump sum grant andthe attendants allowance, is shared equally between men and women con-distributors.In the case of the death grant the contribution charged to women is related to the cost of the benefit for an individual person, whereas the man&apos;contribution includes also the amount necessary in respect of the grants pay-able on the death of dependants, whether adults or children.
As already indicated, the rates of contribution have been determinedseparately for each sex; but it is impracticable to assess and charge a separatecontribution for each category of contributor according to marital status. Itmay be remarked, however, that, as a result of the process of averaging, a woman who docs not marry pays an appreciably lower contribution for herpension, and in total, than would be necessary if this group could be con-sidered in isolation and not as a part of the aggregate of women con-distributors.12. The results of these calculations are given in the following statement(Table I), column (i) of which shows, for a person in Class I, the amountof the contribution payable from age 18 on the assumption that for youngpersons under that age the contributions will be fixed at two-thirds of theadult rates. In columns (2) to (4) the contribution is subdivided into the shares due from the insured person, the employer and the Exchequer on thebasis that (i) the Exchequer meets one-third of the cost of unemploymentbenefit and one-sixth of the cost of other benefits (excepting death grant) and(ii) the balance of the contributions is shared equally between insured person and employer, except for maternity grant and attendants allowance (but notthe maternity benefit for gainfully occupied women) and death grant, whichare charged to the insured person.Table I Rates of Contribution required for Social Insurance Benefits for anAdult in Class I(in pence per week)	Full Actuarial Contribution	Contribution from		Balance not provided for, forming part of Exchequer contribution to scheme		Insured Person	Employer	Men Retirement pensions Widows&apos;    and    guardians&apos; benefits Unemployment benefit Sickness     and     invalidity benefits Maternity grant Death grant...

13. The contributions for persons in Class I are based on the results incolumns (2) and (3) of Table I rounded to the next higher penny, and those for persons in Classes II and IV have been assessed on similar linos, allowing for the differences in respect of those Classes, viz., (i) the absence of unem-ploymcnt benefit and the exclusion of the first 4 weeks from sickness benefit in class II, (ii) the absence of both sickness and unemployment benefits in class IV, and (hi) the necessarily differing conditions governing excusal ofcontributions. In all three Classes the.rates of contribution proposed to becharged are to include a payment towards the cost of the national health service, which has been fixed at iod. a week for men and 8d. for women, witha reduced payment of 6d. for young persons under age 18. The make-upof the contributions is as follows (Table II):  Table II Rates of Contribution for Adults in Classes I, II and IV(in pence per week)	Class I				Class II		Class IV		Men		Women		Men	Women	Men	Women	Insured Person	Em-ployer	Insured Person	Em-ploycr				For  social insurance benefits Towards health ser-vice Total contri-bution re-quired Rates of con-tribution proposed	34-7	31-9	-7-7 6-5	24-S i-5	39-3 IO-O	33-7 8-o	29-5 IO-O	23-7 8-o	43-2 s. d. 3   7	33-4 s. d. 2 10	34-2 s. d. 2 10	26-3 s. d. 2    3 *	49-3 s.

The insured person&apos;s share of the contribution in Class I is qd. greaterthan the employees share (7d. for women) partly on account of the differencesappearing in Table I, but mainh/ because the bulk of the payment towardsthe health service falls upon the person himself, the employer paying a sumapproximately equal to his contribution towards the medical treatment of hisemployee under the existing national health insurance scheme.14. It may be noted that the principal rates of contribution, viz.. 6s. 3d.a week for men and 5s. id. a week for women in Class I, are la. id. and lid.respectively less than the corresponding contributions proposed in the beveridge Report.* The reduction in contributions is the net effect of anumber of factors, the most important of which are set out below, the savingor addition shown in each case incoqoorating the effect of payment of theadult rate of contribution (and where appropriate the adult rate of benefit)from age 18 instead of age 21:  (i) the treatment of workmcn&apos;s compensation in a separate scheme saving (in the social insurance contribution) about 3d. for men and 2d. forwomen, including cost of administration;* When the separate contributions for industrial injury insurance are added (see para-graph 5) the total rates of contributions are 7d. less, for each sex, than those propped inthe Beveridge Report.

The population of Great Britain at the present time is estimated to beabout 47J million persons, and this figure has been taken for practical purposes has the population at the commencement of the new scheme. Assuming therestoration under peace-time conditions of a distribution by occupationalstatus corresponding in general to the pre-war position, the classification ofthis total for the purpose of the scheme is as follows: 
1945	1955	19^5	1975169 34 S7 &quot;&quot;55 9 4 16	203 41 S7 66 S 7 16	272 4Q S5 68 S 11 16	324 36 80 &amp;5 7 &apos;4 16374 37 6 4	428 41 6 4	500 39 21 6 4	542 37 20 6 469 57	73 5S	70 54	5Q59 148	60 170	56 170	52 170650	73i	796	S31Social Insurance BenefitsRetirement pensionsWidows&apos; and guardians&apos; benefitsUnemployment benefit ...Sickness and invalidity benefitsMaternity grant and benefits  ...Death grantCost of administration ...Total.........National AssistanceAssistance pensionsUnemployment assistanceOther assistance ...Cost of administration ...Total.........Family AllowancesAllowancesCost of administration ...Total.........Health ServiceTotal Expenditure17. From 1955 onwards the continuous increase in the rate of total expendi-ture from  731 millions in 1955 to ^831 millions in 1975 is more thanaccounted for by the growing cost of retirement pensions, viz., from  203millions to  324 millions. In the first ten years the growth of expenditure is affected by a number of special factors which influence the cost of widows&apos;and guardians&apos; benefits, sickness and invalidity benefits and the health service.The pensions cost in 1945 is not precisely comparable with later years because it does not include any pensions for persons brought into insurance for thefirst time (mainly in Classes II and IV) since these do not qualify for pensionsuntil they have been insured for 10 years, or for persons in Class VI at the outset who had not been granted pensions under the existing schemes. Apartfrom this, the rising cost of pensions is mainly due to the natural increase inthe population of pensionable age, which will grow steadily throughout the30 years.o  comparison with previous estimates the year 1945 is taken as the first year in which the social insurance scheme will be in full operation except for persons newly brought into insurance. It is evident, at this date, that thescheme cannot be brought into effect in time for this assumption to be realised,but the general appropriateness of the tables in this memorandum is not therebymaterially affected except for two points. The cost for the actual first year-&quot;ill be slightly greater than that shown for 1945, mainly because the natural increase in the aged population results in a heavier pensions charge in eachsucceeding year; 1955, 1965 and 1975 would somewhat understate the cost for the nth, 21st and 31st years, for the same reason. Further, with theintroduction of the scheme in a later year than 1944, the cost in 1955 will be appreciably less than that shown, because new classes brought in at the outsetwill not qualify for pension benefits for 10 years.1 o Subject to these reservations the figures in the table give a broad picture of the cost of the scheme starting with the first lull year&apos;s expenditure and forthe 10th, 20th and 30th years thereafter.Table IV Estimated Expenditure: 1945-1975(in   mil!ions)
The increase in the cost of widows&apos; and guardians&apos; benefits and sickness andinvalidity benefits between the first and the eleventh year is also due mainly to the fact that, owing to the qualifying condition for these benefits, the full cost does not mature immediately. Similarly the continuing growth in the costof the death grant over the whole period is mainly the result of the exclusion from this benefit of persons over 65 at the outset and of the payment of reducedgrant in respect of those then aged between 55 and 65.Again, the inclusion of a lower figure for the health service in 1945 than rlater years results from the fact that it will be impracticable to bring all thevarious services fully into operation in the first few years of the scheme.18. Retirement pensions. The estimates make allowance for postponement of retirement, and consequent increase in rate of pension. Thus in Class I the broad assumption is that 50 per cent, of men and women will give up workimmediately on reaching pensionable age, that a further 25 per cent, will ret!in the course of the ensuing five years, and that the balance of 25 per cent,will have ceased work during the next five years, i.e., by age 75 (men) or70 (women). The net effect of the retirement condition on the expenditure,i.e., the difference between the pension payments saved by postponementand the sum of the sickness and unemployment benefits payable during theperiod of postponement and the higher payments becoming due on retirement,is estimated to be a saving of expenditure somewhat exceeding  10 millions a year at the outset, rising to between  15 millions and  20 millions in twenty years&apos; time.As regards persons over pensionable age at the outset, allowance is madefor bringing up to the new pension rates those contributory pensioners whoaccept the retirement condition as provided by the proposals. The correspond-ing cost of increasing the pension of non-contributory pensioners is includedin the cost of assistance pensions.19. Unemployment benefit and assistance. Only 72J per cent, of the un-emplo&apos;ed, on the assumed average rate of 8k per cent, unemployment, areincluded in the cost of benefit. A further 20 per cent, are assumed to receiveassistance on the scales at present in force, the cost of which falls upon theExchequer. The item of unemployment assistance includes also a small sum for supplementation to meet special needs of persons on unemployment benefit.As regards the cost for the first 3&apos;ear, it should be borne in mind that theestimates assume stabilised post-war conditions, and make no allowance fordisturbance resulting from war conditions or on demobilisation.The cost of unemployment benefit and of assistance will be reduced as aresult of the separate scheme providing, at the cost of the Exchequer, trainingallowances (in lieu of benefit) to unemploy-ed persons undergoing approvedtraining. On the other hand the social insurance fund is to be liable fora pa3-ment to the Exchequer not exceeding  500,000 a year in respect ofthis relief. The net effect on the fund is likely to be small and has beenignored in the present estimates. It will depend on the number ofunemplo37ed persons who are able to take advantage of the scheme and theproportion of their periods of training during which they would otherwise have received unemployment benefit.20. National assistance. Under this head is included not only unemploy&apos;-ment assistance, as already mentioned, and assistance to meet the needs ofother persons under pensionable age, but also assistance pensions. Thesecomprise (i) pensions at rates varying from the present 10s. a week (or less)up to the new full rates of pension, on an appropriately modified meansscale, to existing non-contributory old age pensioners, (ii) supplementa-tion to existing pensioners, and future pensioners from Class I, II or IV,and (iii) pensions according to need to persons in Class II or IV who are
unable to qualify for retirement pensions or, having small incomes, naveelected to be exempt from contributions.21. Family allowances. The cost of the 5s. benefit for the first child in family, where payable, is included with the related benefit, i.e., widows&apos; andguardians&apos;, unemployment, or sickness and invalidity&apos; benefits as is done inthe calculation of the rates of contribution given in paragraph 12 above. the for the second and subsequent children in each family constitutes, with 53.a head for orphaned children, the cost shown for family allowances. Thebalance of the orphan&apos;s 12s. benefit, i.e., 7s. a week, which is to be provided from social insurance funds, is included in the contribution and the cost for widows&apos; and guardians&apos; benefits.For the purpose of the present estimates, the minimum school-leaving agetaken as 15 at the outset (with allowance for children remaining at school^iter that age until 31st July following their 16th birthday; and 16 for theother years, on the assumption that by 1955 it will have been possible to raisethe school-leaving age to the full extent (viz., to age 16) proposed in theEducation Bill now before Parliament.!As indicated in Table IV, I estimate the cost of these allowances to be 57 millions in 1945*. Their cost in later years will depend increasingly uponthe future trend of the fertility rate, i.e., upon the number of births per married woman at each age. If the fertility rate after the war is stabilised at aboutthe pre-war level, the number of eligible children will decrease. The figuresof expenditure on family allowances have been computed on the assumptionthat fertility rates in the future will be the same as in recent pre-war years,and accordingly show a drop to  50 millions in 1975. The small increase ofexpenditure between 1945 and 1955 is the net result of this factor and of theeffect of the assumed increase in the school-leaving age.22. Health service. In the White Paper on a National Health Service(Cmd. 6502) a rough estimate of  148 millions is given for the annual cost ofthe scheme for Great Britain soon after the outset; this figure has therefore been adopted for 1945 in the present memorandum. As indicated in the white paper, however, the cost is likeh/ to grow for some years as the services which are proposed come into fuller operation, and a round figure of  170millions has been taken as a reasonable allowance for 1955 onwards, afterconsultation with the Ministry of Health and the Department of Flealth forScotland.The payment towards the cost of the health service included in the social insurance contribution, viz., iod. (men) and 8d. (women), with 6d. for young,persons under 18, will, it is estimated, produce about  39 millions a year atthe outset, falling to about  36 millions in thirty years&apos; time. Thus the costof these services met from taxes (or rates) will rise from  109 millions in 1945to  134 millions in 1975.23. Expenses of administration. A total of  22 millions has been included under this head, of which  16 millions relates to insurance benefits. Thesefigures have been assessed broadly by reference to the cost of administering the existing schemes, taking into account the probable effect of the changes,e.g., the increased complexity of some of the benefits, the larger numbers involved, and the economies which may be expected to result from unification.Comparison with Existing System24. It is possible to compare in broad groups the expenditure under theGovernment proposals with that which would be incurred under the existinganalogous schemes, and this has been done for the year 1945 in Table V.* In addition, the cost of the 5s. benefit for the first child, where payable, amounts to^12 millions in 1945.t The Bill received the Royal Assent on 3rd August, 1944.

The figures for childrqn&apos;s benefits, both under existing schemes andunder the Government proposals, relate to allowances for second and subsequent children. Similar allowances for the first child are included with the pension,unemployment or sickness benefit with which they are associated.25. In interpreting the figures it must be borne in mind that the populations1 insured under the existing and the proposed schemes are different; the nature and grouping of the benefits has changed in various respects; and the extentto which particular needs are met from State and private resources, frominsurance and assistance, or from local and national funds, has changed. Theinferences to be drawn must be qualified accordingly.There is the further reservation that the statement has had to be prepared on the footing that stabilised post-war conditions will apply during the year.For various reasons the expenditure under the present schemes in 1945 will beaffected by abnormalities due to the war and the actual outturn for certain items will differ materially from the figures given. But as both sets of figures have been based on the same assumptions, they give a valid comparison ofthe schemes.26. The statement shows that in the aggregate the services brought within thescheme will cost about 60 per cent, more than the comparable existing servicesmet from public funds. Very broadly the increase, of about  240 millions, canbe attributed in more or less equal parts to:(i) the increase in the rates of pension, both contributory and non-con-tributory;Table V Comparative Statement of Estimated Expenditure in 1945(assuming stabilisation under post-war conditions)

As compared with the initial cost of the plan proposed in the beveridge report, viz.,  697 millions for 1945, the proposals show a saving of  47 millions..This is due mainly to (i) the omission of industrial disability benefits (including, dministration), which are to be dealt with separately ( 17 millions); (ii) the allowance for non-emergence of the full cost of the health service at the outset( 22 millions); (iii) a net saving on family allowances (about  40 millions); and(iv) a net reduction in the cost of unemployment and sickness benefits and related assistance (about  10 millions); against which must be set (v) the extra cost of enlarged retirement pensions and widows&apos; benefits (about  45 millionsincluding  8 millions for the effect of the new scale of supplementary pensionsintroduced subsequent to the submission of the Beveridge Report).Cost to the Exchequer28. The income available to meet the cost of the proposed schemes consists of the receipts from the contributions payable by persons (and their employers)insured in Classes I, II and IV, together with interest from the existing social insurance funds, assuming these to be retained as a reserve for the benefit ofthe new scheme; the balance of expenditure has to be met from general taxation or from local rates. In Table VI which follows I have summarised the estimated expenditure as shown in Table IV and the income from eachsource in the form of a budget covering the social insurance scheme and allied services: -Table VI Social Insurance and Allied Services Budget: 1945-1975
29- In the above statement the receipts from contributions are based on therates set out in paragraph 5 above, allowing for the estimated loss due to non-payment of contributions (i) by persons whose contributions are excusedduring sickness, unemployment, etc., as provided for in the scheme, (ii) bymarried women who, though gainfully occupied, elect to be exempt from con-tributions, or are compuisorily exempt on the ground of low earnings,(iii) by persons in Classes II and IV who exercise the option not &apos; icontribute owing to their income being below a certain figure. In the caseof Class I the contributions include the employers&apos; share, which accounts for about 40 per cent, of the total sum yielded by all contributions.30. As indicated in paragraph 10 above, the rates of contribution proposedrepresent, for benefits other than unemployment benefit and death grant (towhich special considerations apply), five-sixths of the actuarial contributefor the benefits in question. These contributions are in effect insurance pre-miums and in the case of a private scheme, or in a national scheme involving(as does the existing national health insurance scheme) the maintenance of anumber of independent financial units, it would be necessary to accumulate thecontributions in a fund from which emerging expenditure would be met as itarose. Under the Government proposals all branches of social insurance areto be administered as a unified scheme, and the Exchequer grant will takethe form of meeting the balance of all expenditure as it falls due, in so far as itis not met by the current proceeds from contributions. It will, therefore, be unnecessary to maintain accumulative funds either for the scheme as a wholeor for any parts of it. It follows that the invested assets of the existing schemes, in part built up (in the case of health insurance) to provide actuarialreserves and in part (as in unemployment and pensions) as a result of thespecial conditions of the war, are set free by the supersession of the existing system and may be regarded as available for utilisation in the most suitablemanner for the support of the new scheme.In view of the greatly increased burdens placed upon the Exchequer by theenlargement of the benefits of existing insured persons, it would seem equitablethat the Exchequer should have the advantage of the existing funds and theGovernment have decided that they shall be utilised in this manner. I have accordingly assumed that the interest thereon is to be set against expenditurein arriving at the cost of the scheme to the Exchequer.31. The allowance of  15 millions for interest on funds, as shown in Table VI,assumes the retention for this purpose of  550 millions from the assets of theexisting health, pensions and unemployment insurance systems, and has regardto the average interest yielded on the securities held. At 31st December, 1943,the total invested assets of the health insurance system, held partly by the approved societies and partly by the central departments or the National DebtCommissioners, amounted to about  245 millions. At 31st March, 1944, the balances in the unemployment fund amounted to  252 millions and those in thepensions accounts to  76 millions. All these balances, amounting now to atotal of over  575 millions, will continue to grow so long as the abnormalconditions of the war remain; thereafter the position, more especially as regardsthe unemployment fund, will depend largely on the steps taken to deal withpost-war demobilisation and unemployment.Bea ring in mind that these assets will be supplemented by very considerablepayments which will become due from the Service departments to the unem-ployment fund on general demobilisation^ I have reached the conclusion that,* During service in the Forces, the ordinary weekly unemployment contributions arenot payable, an appropriate capital sum being paid by the departments on a man&apos;idischarge.
after allowing for the retention of a substantial reserve to meet the possiblestrain of post-war adjustment, the assets set free will be of the order ol  550millions, producing an annual income of  15 millions.32. It will be seen from Table VI that the balance of expenditure to be met from taxation or rates, as thus assessed, amounts to  352 millions in 1945,increasing steadily throughout the thirty years to reach a figure of  557 millions- &quot;.e., practically 60 per cent, greater) in 1975. The Exchequer charge at the outset under the Government proposals is compared with the correspondingcharge under the existing schemes in paragraph 33, and the growth of thecharge in relation to the total expenditure under the proposals is examined further in paragraphs 35 and 36.33. A comparison of the sources of the income required under the existingind proposed schemes is given for 1945 in Table VII which follows:  Table VII Comparative Statement of Estimated Income in 1945(assuming stabilisation under post-war conditions)Receipts from contributions of insured persons and employers Interest on existing funds Expenditure  to   be   met   from Exchequer   (or   local   rates)	Under    Present    Social Insurance Schemes and Allied Services		Under   Government Proposals		I Millions	Percentages	  Millions	Percentages	136 15 278	3-3 65	283 15 352	44 2 54	429*	100	650      1        100	* This figure is  18 millions greater than the corresponding expenditure, viz. /411millions, given in Table V. This is due partly to the occurrence of small excesses of income which remain in the contributory pensions and health insurance schemes as now financedbut mainly to the changes in the financial position of the unemployment scheme, due first to interest on the substantial balances which have been built up in the fund as a result ofthe war, and secondly to the fact that the existing unemployment contribution is basedon a higher rate of unemployment than has been assumed for the post-war period.The charge on the Exchequer and local rates at the outset is thus  74 millionsmore than the estimated charge which would have been incurred if the existing system had remained in force in 1945 (subject to the limitations indicated inparagraph 25 above) whilst contributions of insured persons and employersprovide an extra  147 millions.34. As regards the share to be borne by local authorities, under the existing schemes local authority expenditure arises on public assistance and health services. The amount included for them in the estimates is  75 millions ayear out of the total of  278 millions to be met from national and local taxation, as will be seen from Table V.Under the Government proposals local authorities will meet part of the costof the national health service (as explained in Cmd. 6502). Public assistance will be transferred to national assistance, and on this transfer a financial adjust -ment will, it is understood, be negotiated with local authorities. It is esti-mated that, of the  352 millions falling to be met from national and local taxation in 1945,  53 millions will fall to be met from rates (and generalExchequer contributions to local revenues) in respect of local authorities&apos;expenditure on health services. Financial adjustments between the Exchequerand the local authorities consequent on the transfer of public assistance have
yet to be determined. Thus the allocation of the balance of expenditure shownin Table VI for 1945 and later years cannot be indicated at the present time.35. It will be observed that at the outset the Exchequer charge-thoughmuch increased in amount-forms a smaller proportion than before of thetotal income required to provide all the services (54 per cent, against 65 percent.). The Exchequer proportion increases greatly with time, however; by1965, as may be deduced from Table VI, it will have grown to 64 per ceon a much larger budget, and in 30 years&apos; time fully two-thirds of all expenai-ture will be met from national and local taxation, less than one-third coming from social insurance contributions.36. Taking social insurance benefits alone, the Exchequer share will be-nearly one-third at the outset, growing to one-half in 1965, with a further increase to about 55 per cent, when the scheme has been in force for thiriyears. The proportion of the cost met by the Exchequer in the case of social insurance benefits thus very greatly exceeds the proportion of the actuarialcontribution allocated to the Exchequer, viz. about 22 per cent, taking allbenefits together (see Table I in paragraph 12). There are two main reasonsfor this. First, in addition to this direct subsidy to all contributors there isa further subsidy due to admitting the existing population of all ages for theordinary benefits at the same rate of contribution as is charged to new entrantsat age 16. Secondly, the liability thus undertaken by the State is not extin-distinguished over a fixed period of years as would be the case if a series of deficiency round were made to an accumulative fund.The State will in fact discharge its liabilities, as regards both the proportionof the contributions which it undertakes to meet and the strain of admittingthe existing population at the flat rate of contribution, by making good the excess of expenditure over income from contributions as it emerges year by year. The result is a charge on the taxpayer which will increase for a con-siderable period, as the expenditure on pensions gradually matures, and willlast in perpetuity this burden being attributable mainly to the proportion ofthe contributions undertaken by the Exchequer and to the substantial increasemade in pensions provision and, to a less extent, to the increases in sicknessbenefits.Conclusion37. The estimates in this memorandum are necessarily based on peace-time conditions which have perforce been related to those obtaining before thebeginning of the war. Clearly it is impracticable at the present time to attemptto measure with any precision the changes which may occur in the socialconstitution of the population as it is now, or was immediately before thewar, and as it will be after the immediate disturbances due to the war have passed away. Further, the war is not yet finished and it is impossible to assess the extent of future casualties.Many of these changes will, no doubt, have direct or indirect consequences which may materially affect the realisation of the estimates. As instances,reference may be made to (i) the future level of unemployment and the propor-tions of the unemplo5--ed who will be entitled to unemployment benefit and to national assistance respectively, these factors being fundamental elements inthe financial structure of the scheme; (ii) the future level of sickness, in respectof which conditions will differ radically from those under which the availablesickness tables have been compiled; and (iii) the effect on the cost of pensions of making the grant of pension dependent on retirement from work, as to which no past experience under comparable conditions is available.In the circumstances, having regard to the fundamental nature of the changesfrom the various schemes of social insurance now existing for contributory
pensions, national health insurance and unemployment insurance the past experience of which has had to be used, with modifications, as the basis ofthe new estimates it will be appreciated that the actual experience when thenew scheme has been brought fully into operation may prove to differ materiallyfrom the assumptions made. The working of the scheme in all its aspectswill clearly have to be tested by periodical actuarial investigations. These willfi-vc regard primarily to long-term trends as affecting the financial equilibriumi.. the various parts of the scheme, the continued suitability of the rates of contribution prescribed, and the growth in the charge falling upon theExchequer. In the light of these reviews the Government will be in a positionto take early action, by modifications in the rates of contribution, or otherwise,in order to maintain the financial balance of the scheme.G. S. W. EPPS.Government Actuary&apos;s Department,London, S.W.I.June, 1944.APPEiNDIX IIAPPROVED societies. Arrangements for the employment of Approved Societies as agents for payingbenefit under a unified scheme of social insurance might take one of two forms:  (i) The Society might be a responsible agent taking decisions, authorising pay-ments and making provision for sickness visitation, subject only to general super-vision and audit.(ii) The Society might be merely a paying agent acting on directions from thecentral authority.The agency proposals in the Report contemplated a system on the lines of .(i).2. The Report suggested that the conditions for such a system should include:  (i) That the Society gave a substantial sickness benefit from its own resources,i.e. from the voluntary contributions of its members.(ii) That it had an efficient system for visiting its members wherever theymight be.(iii) That it was effectively self-governing.(iv) That it did not work for profit and was not associated with any body working for profit.(v) That it was registered tinder the Frendly Soceties Acts or the Trade UnionActs or, if not registered, that it conformed substantially to the requirements for registration.Societies satisfying the conditions proposed would cover only a limited part of thefield. Societies associated with the Industrial Assurance Companies and CollectingSocieties would be ineligible under conditions (i) and (iv). Condition (i) would alsoexclude a number of other Approved Societies which make no provision for voluntarysickness benefit. In fact, the only bodies which would be eligible as agents wouldbe certain Friendly Societies and Trade Unions whose aggregate membership would be unlikely to cover more than between one quarter and one third of the total number&quot;f persons who will be insured for sickness benefit under the new scheme. For theremainder provision would have to be made by the Central Department.3. In favour of such an arrangement it may be said that within the limited field which it  would  cover (i) It would continue those features of personal contact and friendly relationship which are associated with the administration of bene tits by certain types of approved societies.(ii) It would enable private benefit to be administered in association with Statebenefit of similar character, possibly with some economy in the running costs of theprivate sides of Societies.
(iii) It would help to maintain the administration of benefits on a local and self-governing basis.(iv) It would avoid the displacement of a number of Approved Societies&apos; officials and would enable them to continue with the work in which they had becomeexperienced.4. The main arguments cii;ai)ist  may be summarised thus:  (i) Societies satisfying the conditions proposed would be unlikely to cover morothan, at most, one third of the population insured for sickness benefit.(ii) The condition that the Society should give a substantial benefit from itsown resources (essential as an incentive to careful administration) might be expectedto give rise to difficulties in practice. Few Societies give substantial sickness benefits on the private side for more than a limited period of sickness; thus Societies wouldfrequently be paying State sickness benefit for prolonged illnesses where voluntarybenefit had become small in amount or had ceased altogether, and in such casesthe incentive to review the claims with due care would be much reduced.(iii) It is difficult to see how a Society with a scattered membership could maintainpersonal contact with its members.5. If the alternative plan were adopted of allowing Societies to be mere payingagents, without being responsible for controlling claims, there would be no case for retaining the conditions set out in paragraph 2 above, or for excluding any particulartype of Society.6. The one substantial argument that can be advanced in favour oi such an arrange-ment is that it would enable the Central Department to make immediate use of the extensive organisation of agents and officials, which covers practically the entirecountry. This would ensure the continuance, on a much wider scale than would bepossible under the more restricted agency arrangement, of the method of payingsickness benefit to which people have become accustomed.7. Against the arrangement the principal argument is that on general grounds ofpolicy it is undesirable to entrust the disbursement of State funds on a large scale toagencies which have no direct responsibility for administration, and whose officers are neither the servants of the Government nor under direct Government control. Theadoption of an agency arrangement would also perpetuate the undesirable overlappingof territory between local agents of different bodies with resulting duplication andwaste of effort.8. Under either alternative there would be a dual system of administration, since it would be necessary for the Central Department to maintain local offices to administer(i) the benefits, other than sickness benefit, of insured persons generally and (ii) thesickness benefits of those who did not choose to join an Approved Society. Therewould be a very large measure of duplication in the work of compiling and maintain-ing the contribution records of insured persons and other data relating to theirinsurance.9. The Government have had an opportunity of receiving the considered views of the Approved Societies through deputations representing most types of society. The first of these deputations was a joint one, from the National Conferenceof Friendly Societies and other bodies representative of Approved Societies,including the National Conference of Industrial Approved Societies. The totalnumber of insured persons covered by the constituent Societies of these organisa-tions amounts to approximately iS millions, about 85 per cent, of the total insured population. The second deputation was from the National Federation of Employees&apos;Approved Societies, the constituent Societies of which have a membership of some 300,000. These deputations did not accept the arguments for the abolitionof Approved Societies, but as an alternative to the retention of Societies as independentfinancial units, they both submitted detailed proposals under which the Societies would act as responsible agents taking decisions and authorising payments, but withoutthe limitations and safeguards recommended in the Report.10. Summarised, the proposals of the National Conference of Friendly Societies,and of the bodies associated with them in the deputation, are on the following lines:  (i) &quot; Approved  Agencies &quot; should be established.    Any body consisting of notless than 5,000 members should be approved provided:  (a) The body had efficiently administered a scheme of sickness benefit (on a voluntary basis or under a State compulsory scheme) for not less than twenty-five years.
(b) The affairs of the body were subject to effective self-government by its members.(The Approved Agencies would be in effect the larger of the existing friendly societies and the Industrial Approved Societies, though the smaller ones would beallowed to combine, on the State side only, in order to reach the minimum qualifyingmembers liip.)(ii) Every insured person should have complete freedom of choice of ApprovedAgency with  the  right to transfer at recognised   periods.    If a  person did not( :xercise his choice he would be assigned to an Approved Agency by the Minister.(iii) The principal functions of an Approved Agency would be:  (a) To receive State contribution cards from its members and record, in surhmanner as the Minister might determine, payments made by its members.(b) To authorise and pay all claims made by its members for not only sickness benefit, but industrial disability benefit, maternity benefit, maternity grant, widows&apos;benefit,  dependant&apos;s allowance,  marriage grant and funeral grant.(c) To administer an effective system of sickness visitation among its members.(d) To submit its accounts in respect of payments made on behalf of the state to Government Auditors.(e) Generally to comply with any Regulation made by the appropriate Ministeraffecting Approved Agencies.(iv) A Central Registry (or a number of Regional Registries) of insured persons should be established under the supervision and control of the Minister which would serve as a Clearing House by means of which all the insurance data relating to anyparticular individual would be made available to the various organisations responsiblefor the administration of the several types of social insurance benefits.(v) Approved Agencies should be remunerated on a per capita basis.(vi) If the Minister were satisfied that an Approved Agency was not complying with the conditions under which it became &quot; approved,&quot; the Minister would havepower to withdra%v approval, subject to the right of the body to appeal to anindependent Tribunal.ii. These proposals of the National Conference, which have a much wider scopethan the agency arrangements proposed in the Report, have been examined with thegreatest care but have been found to be open to weighty objections, viz. :  (i) The Agencies would have no direct financial incentive to administer social insurance benefits carefully. This incentive to efficient administration is one to whichthe Government attach the utmost importance. Provision is made in the proposalsfor supervisory measures such as Government inspection and audit, but these arenormal features of any scheme involving expenditure of public funds; they aresubsidiary to, and in no way a substitute for, the safeguard of direct financial responsibility.(ii) The proposed system would place upon the Approved Agencies the dutyof forwarding to the Central Registry all the insurance data required for the purposeof claims for benefit (e.g. unemployment benefit) which the Agencies themselves would not administer. This would involve a great deal of duplication in the compila-tion and maintenance of records and a cumbersome interchange of detailed informa-tion between the Approved Agencies, the Centra! Registry and the organisationsresponsible for the administration of social insurance benefits other than thoseadministered by the Agencies.(iii) The free right of transfer would inevitably lead to undesirable competition between Agencies.(iv) The proposal that a Central Department should arbitrarily assign a person who does not exercise his choice to a particular agency is full of difficulties. it involves an invidious jurisdiction and opens up the possibility of unbecomingdisputes.12. The National Federation of Employees&apos; Approved Societies are at one withthe National Conference of Friendly Societies in urging that ali insured persons shouldreceive their benefits through Approved Agencies but they feel that the difficulty of ensuring financial responsibility in the absence of financial autonomy might be metmore adequately.   Thev propose:  (i) To make the existing representative Associations of Approved Societies the units for the administration of benefits on an agency basis, the individual Societiesbeing conducted as branches of the Associations;
(ii) To set up a Statutory Committee consisting of a representative of each Associa-tion and representatives of the Government with an independent Chairman appointedby the Minister.The functions of this Statutory Committee would include the investigation of excessive sickness claims, the co-ordination of arrangements for sick visiting, the investigation of cases of alleged maladministration, and the co-ordination of administra-tive procedure.The underlying basis of this suggestion is that the presence, in such aggregations, of individual   Societies   giving   substantial   voluntary   sickness   benefits   would   ensueconomical administration throughout the whole unit.   There seems little substance in this argument and in any event the largest of the various aggregations proposed would not include any constituent Society providing a voluntary sickness benefit.APPENDIX  IIIMISCELLANEOUS POINTS IN THE SCHEME;. This Appendix sets out the Governments proposals on a number of miscellaneousmatters, mostly connected with machinery or procedure.It does not purport to be exhaustive. It would be impracticable to enumerate ina Paper of this character all the points of detail requiring settlement in the prepara-tion of a comprehensive scheme of social insurance. The items mentioned are included,partly as being of sufficient importance in themselves to justify mention, and partly by way of illustration of the various problems that arise.Contributions, Excusals, Exemptions, etc.2. The following is a broad outline of the proposed arrangements for payment ofcontributions.3. Weekly Contribution. There will be a single weekly contribution for all pur-poses for each person, though the amount will depend upon sex and classification,with lower rates for persons under age 18.The rates of contribution are set out in paragraph 48 of the Paper. The method of payment will normally be by purchase of the appropriate stamp to be affixed to theinsurance card. The payment of contributions due will be enforceable by legal proceedings.Every week in the year should be accounted for either by contributions or by theexemptions or excusais referred to below, which may be granted in special circum-stances.4. Contribution Record. A person&apos;s contribution record, i.e. the number of class I, II or IV stamps and excusals, will determine his right to the various benefits to be provided under the scheme for each insurance Class. The position of a married woman unless she is separately insured will be governed by her husband&apos;s contributionrecord.5. Excusals. Contributions will be &quot; excused,&quot; i.e. will be deemed to have been paid for the purpose of certain contribution conditions, as follows:  Excusal from GroundsClass     I contributions Certified   sickness,   maternity  and   unem-ployment.Class  II contributions Certified sickness and maternity.Class IV contributions Receipt of widow&apos;s or guardian&apos;s benefit orwidow&apos;s pension (other than the 10s.widow&apos;s pension payable under theexisting scheme or the transitional arrangements); full-time educational in-struction of students and others, sub-ject to certain conditions; and unpaidapprenticeship.All contributions Receipt of training allowance.6. Exemptions. It is proposed to exempt persons in certain circumstances frompayment of contributions. Contributions in such cases will not be exacted from theexempt person although if he has an employer the employees share of the contributionwill be payable. Except in the case of maternity benefit, contributions from which persons are exempted will not be deemed to have been paid for the purpose of satis-fying the contribution tests. (The rights of exempt persons under the National health service will not be affected by the fact that they are exempt from the payment of social insurance contributions.)
The circumstances in which exemption will be granted are as follows:  (i) Exemption, on account of low income [Class II and Class IV).Persons falling into Class II or Class IV whose total income is below /75 a year will be permitted to claim exemption.The Report suggests that here there might be the alternatives of total exemp-tion or exemption from the payment of contributions other than the part allocatedtowards the cost of medical services. The Government doubt whether the proposalto sub-divide persons exempt on grounds of low income into those who can and thoseho cannot pay the proportion of the weekly contribution in respect of medical services is administratively practicable or desirable and think it better that totalexemption should be granted in all such cases.(ii) Persons over pension age who take up employment after having accepted retire-ment pension.Persons in these circumstances will, as under the present schemes, be exempt from payment of contributions.&apos;iii) Widows in receipt of guardians benefit or widow&apos;s pension.Widows entitled to guarclian&apos;s benefit will, if gainfully occupied, have the option of being exempt from payment of Class I or Class II contributions.    (If not gainfullyoccupied, they will, as already explained, be excused payment of Class IV contri-butions.)Similar treatment will be accorded to those who are entitled to widow&apos;s pension(other than the ros. pension payable under the existing scheme or the transitional arrangements). It is not thought that there are sufficient grounds for allowing exemp-tion to gainfully occupied widows without dependent children who are in receipt of the short-term widow&apos;s benefit.(iv) Gainfully occupied married women.The question of exemption, whether optional or compulsory, for such women is dealt with in paragraphs 108-111 of the Paper.(v) Insured persons in prison.No formal grant of exemption will be given but evidence of detention will beaccepted as explanation of non-compliance during the relevant period. It will beopen to the insured person to arrange for contributions to be paid on his behalfat the Class IV rate.7. Change of Insurance Class. The insurance card will show the normal insuranceClass for contribution purposes. Many people will remain in the same insurance Classduring their whole working life, or for very substantial periods. Change of occupationinvolving change of insurance Class may, however, take place frequently. The holderof a Class I insurance card normally emplo3red under contract of service may fromtime to time take up work on his own account and so find himself in an occupationwhere a Class II stamp is appropriate; or he may give up work for a week or two and fall into Class IV. Similarly a man engaged in business on his own accountholding a Class II insurance card may engage from time to time in employment under contract of service and during these periods will fall into Class I.For each insurance week a contribution appropriate to the insurance class into whichthe contributor falls in that week will be payable whatever the class of insurancecard held.S. Liability to Contribute in more than One Class in One Week. Cases will arisewhere part of a week is spent on work which does not correspond to the insurancecard held, e.g., where a man does three days of employment under a contract ofservice and three days of work on his own account.Subject to the exceptions mentioned in the following paragraph, any insurableemployment under contract of service on any day of the week will carry a Class Istamp and no other stamp will be due in that week. To facilitate this arrangement,the liability of a person to pay a Class II or Class IV contribution will not arise ineach week until the end of that week, but for Class I the present principle that thefirst employer in the week is liable, for the contribution will continue.9. Subsidiary or Inconsiderable Employments. Under existing law persons engagedin an employment specified by Special Order as being ordinarily adopted as subsidiaryemployment and not as the principal means of livelihood are excepted from all thesocial insurance schemes, and persons employed only to an extent which is regardedas inconsiderable are excepted from the unemployment insurance scheme. TheGovernment propose to apply these exceptions in the new scheme. In the rules forstamping in Class I, no account will be taken of work which is for the above reasonsexcepted. Similarly, the question whether the contribution should be at the Class nor Class IV rate will depend on whether, in the particular case, the employment oroccupation is substantial enough to bring the person within the &quot; gainfully occupiedclass.
io. Family Employments. Persons engaged in family employment (i.o., employ-ment of one member of a family by another forming part of the same household)who strictly fall under Class I. will be excluded from that Class and will fall intoClass II. The exclusion from insurance of a married&apos; woman employed by her husband, which appears in the existing scheme, will be continued. In view of theprovision which the new scheme proposes for married women on their husbands&apos;insurance, the exclusion will extend to married women who are associated in cmploy-ment with their husbands, whether as partners, employers, or employees.ii. Method of Payment. Payment will normally be made by affixing the apppriate stamp each week to the insurance card, but in suitable cases the use of hi^ivalue stamps covering a number of weeks may be authorised. Consideration will begiven to alternative methods of payment of contributions to meet exceptional cir-cumstances, e.g., by remittances supported by schedules, and possibly in Classes and IV by means of cheque, money order, etc.Contributions at the Class I rate will in no circumstances be payable otherwise than for weeks in which there has been bona fide employment in respect of which suchcontributions are appropriate (including weeks of paid holiday).12. Payment of Qualifying Contributions. Title to benefit will not arise until anumber of initial qualifying contributions have been actually paid.The right to pay such initial qualifying contributions during sickness or unemploy-ment is a feature of the existing Health and Pensions schemes; but under theUnemployment Insurance scheme contributions cannot be paid at present for weeks of unemployment.Since the main object of the initial qualifying contribution conditions for benefit is to restrict the benefits payable in any Class to persons who have established a status in that Class, there is considerable objection to allowing payment of qualifyingcontributions during sickness or unemployment and it is not proposed to permit it.13. Fractional Contributions. Consideration has been given to a suggestion in theReport that a reduced contribution should be provided for a short period of employ-ment, e.g., two or three days. This would involve as a minimum the use of half-rate stamps, excusals for &quot; half weeks &quot; and probably half-size stamps.It is considered that the practical objections are so great that no provision shouldbe made for the payment of fractional contributions. Many of these cases will be covered by the subsidiary or inconsiderable employments provisions.14. Employment by Several Employers.    Provision has been made in the existingHealth and Pensions schemes for the approval of agreements by employers to pay contributions in rotation. Formal agreements are rare but informal arrangements are frequently made. The existing facilities for formal agreements will be available under the new scheme.15. Distribution of Joint Contribution between Employers and Employees whereWasjcs are low. The position of low wage earners up to age 18 will be met bythe lower contribution due. In the case of persons aged 18 and over earning wagesat a rate below 30s. a week the Government propose that the joint contribution(including the industrial injury contribution)  should be distributed as follows:  Men: Emp!oyee&apos;s share 2s   6d.   Employees share 4s. 5d.Women: Employre&apos;s share 2s. od.   Employees share 3s. 5d.The Government do not feel justified in making any redistribution of the contribution in cases where the employee receives board and lodging together with a small moneypayment or has other sources of remuneration from his occupation (e.g. a waiter whorelies partly on tips).Procedure for the Determination of Questions and Appeals16. The Government propose the following arrangements:  (i) Liability to contribute. Disputes on liability to contribute. Class or rate of contribution, etc., will be determined by the Minister, who will have the right tosubmit the question for decision to the High Court. * A party aggrieved by a decisionof the Minister will have a right of appeal to the High Court* on questions of law.(ii) Unemployment benefit. Decisions will be taken in the first instance by insurance Officers. An appeal will lie to a local tribunal constituted on the linesof the existing Courts of Referees under the Unemployment Insurance Acts. appeals from the local tribunals will lie to an Umpire appointed by the Crown, and his decision will be final.
(iii) Sickness, invalidity and maternity benefits and maternity grant, includingattendant&apos;s allowance. Decisions will be taken in the first instance by InsuranceOfficers but, in view of the medical issues which may arise, the appeal arrangementsoutlined above for unemployment benefit will need to be modified to make them suit-able for appeals on questions relating to the benefits dealt with under this heading.Provision will be made, as at present, for enabling references to be made to the HighCourt&apos; on questions of law arising in the course of appeals.(iv) Pensions and widow&apos;s and guardian&apos;s benefit. Claims for pension and widow&apos;s/   nd guardian&apos;s benefit will be decided by the Minister subject  to appeal to theUmpire, whose decision will be final. The existing right of reference to the HighCourt* on questions of law arising in the course of appeals will be retained.Position ok Persons leaving or coming to Great BritainReciprocal Arrangements with   Other  Countries17. Under the legislation governing the present schemes certain powers are given&apos;to make reciprocal arrangements where similar schemes are in operation. It is onlyin Health Insurance that the power extends beyond the British Commonwealth.18. The position of Northern Ireland is exceptional. In Health Insurance, thesame legislation applies to the whole United Kingdom of Great Britain and NorthernIreland. As regards Contributory Pensions and Unemployment Insurance, reciprocal arrangements have been made between the two countries, enabling persons in one country to retain their rights when they go to reside in the other country. Thus,over the whole field of the existing schemes of social insurance in Great Britain andNorthern Ireland there is, in effect, complete integration. The Government ofNorthern Ireland having already announced that they intend to introduce a schemeof social insurance substantially corresponding to the new scheme in Great Britain,it will be possible to maintain this position.19. Reciprocal arrangements have been made with the Isle of Man and Eire, enablingpersons in one country to retain their Health Insurance rights when they go to reside in the other country. Reciprocal arrangements have also been made with the Isle ofMan as regards Contributory Pensions.20. The institution of a comprehensive scheme of social insurance will call for a review of the reciprocal arrangements referred to in the preceding paragraph. Thepresent arrangements will, so far as possible, be continued, but it must be recognisedthat the contemplated improvement of benefits may seriously complicate the position.21. The Government propose to include in the new legislation enabling powers withrespect to reciprocal arrangements. These powers will not be confined lo making arrangements only where the other country provides benefits corresponding to all thebenefits of the British scheme, but will permit limited arrangements also, e.g. for sickness or unemployment benefit or retirement pensions or for a combination oftwo or more of the benefits. The possibility of further provisions governing theinsurance position of those who migrate to other parts of the British Commonwealthwill be examined, but a good deal turns on the nature of the various social insurance schemes that are being or may be developed.Persons Leaving Great Britain Temporarily or Permanently22. It is clear that many people will leave this country in circumstances whichreciprocal arrangements would not cover, and provision must be made to enable such persons to maintain, so far as possible, their insurance rights while abroad.23. Under the peace-time provisions of the existing schemes liability of personsabroad to compulsory insurance was confined broadly to the insurance againstunemployment of persons who were engaged on some particular work and were inthe employment of British employers. Voluntary insurance for health and pensionspurposes was available to qualified persons who were abroad temporarily, or, for pensions insurance, to persons resident permanently in other parts of the BritishCommonwealth. Wider emergency provisions have been introduced to meet thewar situation.24. Unemployment insurance benefits are not payable outside the United Kingdom.Health insurance benefits are not normally payable outside the United Kingdom, but(apart from the above-mentioned reciprocal arrangements) may be paid, subjectto certain conditions and to some extent at the discretion of the authority administer-ing benefit, to persons temporarily abroad. Contributory pensions are not payableunless the pensioner is in the United Kingdom or in some other part of the BritishCommonwealth.
25- In order that any accruing right:&quot; under the british!&apos; sell) me may be- available under the usual conditions when the person concerned returns to this country, theGovernment propose to make the following provision for persons going abroad to countries with which reciprocal arrangements arc not in force.26. Persons employed under contract of service. Liability to insurance in Class i will arise  where (i) the employee is sent abroad for the employment; and(ii) the employer is resident or has his principal place of business in the Unit&quot;!Kingdom; and(iii) the employment is such that it would have been employment in Class if it had been in the United Kingdom.Liability will continue if the employee changes his employer while abroad, pro-viried that conditions (ii) and (iii) are satisfied. It is proposed that a reduced Class Icontribution should be payable in such cases in view of the fact that the employeewill not be in a position to obtain certain of the benefits while abroad.27. Persons who go abroad in other circumstances.    Here it is necessary to di.distinguish between temporary absences abroad and absences of a permanent or semi-permanent character wjiich may extend up to pension age.   In the latter case it seemspracticable to provide for the maintenance of pension rights only.   Title to continueinsurance contributions will be on the following lines:  Payment of Class IV contributions will be permissible, but if the absence doesnot extend beyond thirteen weeks and the person was before going abroad in class I or Class&quot; II, payment of Class II contributions will be permitted. This willenable every person going abroad to maintain his pensions cover, and where theabsence is short it will allow existing rights to sickness benefit to be maintainedas far as possible.Consideration is being given to the methods of payment of contributions in suchcases and to the question of allowing payment of a limited number of contributionson  return   to   this country.28. Benefits abroad. The Government intend generally to follow existing practiceunder the various schemes, though it will be appreciated that the retirement condition in relation to old age pensions, and the reduction of guardian&apos;s benefit, widow&apos;pension and retirement pension to take account of earnings, introduce serious com-plications.Persons coming to Great Britain29. Persons taking up employment under contract of service will be compulsorilvinsured in Class I during the whole of the employment.30. Persons from abroad engaged in busiiiess on their ozvn account or in somegainful occupati07i excepted from Class I will fall into Class II. In order to meetthe case of professional or business men who come to this country for a comparatively short time and to provide a margin of time for classification in other cases, it isproposed that the test for requiring Class II contributions should be that theyhave become &quot; ordinarilv resident,&quot; and that for this purpose a person should bedeemed to be &quot; ordinarily resident &quot; in Great Britain if he has been residing here for over six months, except where residence is only for the purpose of attending acourse of education or study.31. Persons who come to Great Britain and do not take up any definite occupationwill become liable to insurance in Class IV from the date of becoming &quot; ordinarily resident,&quot; defined as above.london printed   AND   PUBLISHED   BY   HIS   MAjESTY&apos;3   STATIONERY  OFFICETo be purchased directly from H.M.

INDUSTRIAL INJURY INSURANCEFOREWORDFor nearly half a century the compensation of workmen for industrial injuryhas been a liability, imposed by law, upon their employer. Under the existing system, it has been open to the employer, and in some cases obligatory onI. .n, to insure himself against this liability; while it has been for the workman tomake his claim and to take steps to enforce it, if challenged, in the Courts ofLaw. Inevitably compensation has thus become a disputable issue between thetwo parties or their representatives. The result has naturally been a growth inlegal complexity and the emergence of certain unsatisfactory features; forexample, the practice of paying, in full discharge of liability for what may prove( d be a permanent or long continued loss of earnings, a lump sum which the employer may offer for the sake of simplicity and finality, and the workmanmay accept for the same reason.Henceforward, the Government, as part of their extension and recasting ofthe social insurance system, propose that provision for disablement or loss of lifefrom industrial injury^ shall become a social service, administered as a separatescheme but under the Minister of Social Insurance. Benefits at special rates willbe paid from a separate insurance fund, to which the employer, workman andthe Exchequer will be contributors. This means a fundamental change in themethod of providing against what may be one of the most grievous forms of personal misfortune: it involves also a great simplification of what has become a very complicated and elaborate system.Under the present system, benefits are related to the estimated loss of earning capacity. Under the Government&apos;s plan benefits will be paid at flat rates,with supplements for fannTy responsibilities. In the earlier weeks, while the workman is incapacitated for work, there will be injury allowances at uniformrates. Afterwards, if disablement is prolonged, there will be industrial pensionsbased, not on loss of earning capacity, but upon the extent to which the work-man has suffered disablement by the injury, by comparison with a normal healthyperson of the same age and sex. The pension will not be affected by any subse-quent earnings of the workman, and (except in some cases of minor disability-)will not be replaced by a lump sum payment. There will be pensions for widows,parents and certain other dependants of those who have died as the result ofindustrial injury.This system is in many respects like that which is the basis of war pensions schemes. It thus recognises a certain similarity between the position of the soldier wounded in battle and that of the man injured in the course of hisproductive work for the community. Neither is liable to have his pensionreduced on account of what he may earn after the injury; each is compensatednot for loss of earning capacity but for whatever he has lost in health, strengthand the power to enjoy life.The new plan will avoid the main weaknesses and difficulties of the existing system. The Government believe that it will remove workmen&apos;s compensation from the atmosphere of controversy and conflict with which it has beensurrounded and will establish it for the future on a happier and sounder founda-tion. It is their intention, if the scheme commends itself to Parliament, tointroduce and pass the necessary legislation as soon as practicable with a viewto bringing it into operation at the same time as the general scheme of social insurance.
I.-THE PRESENT SYSTEMi. The present system of Workmen&apos;s Compensation was first established in1897 and was thus the pioneer system of social security in this country. Basedon the liability of the individual employer under legislation which, where neces-sary, is interpreted and enforced by the Courts, it stands in almost every respect in sharp contrast to the later schemes of social insurance, ft was revolutionaryin the sense that it broke away from the principle that an employer could onlybe made liable to a workman for injury due to his default or the defaultpersons in responsible positions under him, but it was nevertheless largelyinfluenced by the Common Law idea of personal responsibility, as well as bythe prevailing views as to the limits of State interference.2. Before the Act of rSqj there was no legal right to compensation for an industrial injury except in the limited number of cases where, at common law, or under enactments modifying the Common Law, the employer could b /held liable on proof of negligence on his part to pay damages to the workman or his dependants. This liability was extended by the Employers&apos; Liability act of 1SS0, which excluded the defence of common employment in cases of personal injury due to defective work, plant or machinery or to negligence on thepart of persons to whom the employer had delegated responsibility. TinsAct proved ineffective,and between 1880 and 1897 various unsuccessful attempts,of which the most notable was Mr. Asquith&apos;s Employers&apos; Liability Bill of 1893,were made to enlarge still further the circumstances in which the employercould be held responsible on the basis of negligence. It was, however, impos-sible in this way to cover the great number of accidents for which no blamecould reasonably be attached to the employer or persons in responsible posi-tions under him, and it was eventually recognised that the proper line of pro-gress would be by way of an industrial compensation scheme under which compensation would be provided at the employees expense for all ordinaryinjuries sustained by workmen in the course of their employment. The Act of1897 proceeded on &quot;these lines. It imposed a liability on the employer to pay compensation to a workman injured by accident arising out of and in thecourse of his employment, or to his dependants if the accident resulted indeath, whether or not there had been negligence on the part of the employeror anyone employed by him. Nor was negligence on the part of the injuredworkman himself a bar to the recovery of compensation.3. The Act placed no obligation on the employer to insure against thisliability it was left to his good sense to do so should the burden be likely toimpose too severe a strain on his financial resources. In the debates which preceded the passing of the Act it was suggested that the liability should beplaced on a trade insurance fund or funds instead of on the individual employer;but this suggestion was opposed on various grounds, the main criticism being that it would involve more State interference than this country would tolerate.4. The Act did not deprive the workman of his rights at Common Law orunder the Employers&apos; Liability Act for injuries caused through negligence, butit included provisions against the recovery of damages in addition to workmen&apos;compensation. It required the workman to choose between accepting thecompensation provided by the Act and the remedy at common law or underthe Employers&apos; Liability Act, but it provided that if a workman failed in an action against his employer for damages he could obtain from the Court an award of compensation.5. The Act was limited originally to certain dangerous employments, but in1906 it was extended to cover all persons working under a contract of service or apprenticeship, with a few exceptions, of which the most important was thenon-manual worker earning more than  250 (since raised to  420) a year.
C ,te Act of 1906 also provided for death or disablement caused by scheduledindustrial diseases.6. The amount of compensation was fixed, not on the Common Law principleof indemnity for injury due to the fault of another, but on the principle of a division of loss between the employer and the workman; it was related, subjectto maxima, to the average earnings of the workman and it took no account of his family responsibilities. The Act did not give compensation for an injury assul ^, or for the disability resulting therefrom, but only for loss of earning capa-city; h did not make good the whole loss, but was intended to provide a sub-stantial measure of relief to the injured workman or his dependants.7. The Acts have been amended and enlarged from time to time and one ortwo important modifications have been made in their basic principles, notablyK The introduction of compulsory insurance in the coal mining industry underthe Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Coalmines) Act, 1934,* and by the recent war-time Acts,f which, by increasing the weekly compensation by means of flat rateallowances related to family responsibilities, have made a substantial breachin the principle of compensation based on loss of wage-earning capacity. Other-wise the main features of the system introduced in 1897 have remained un-altercd.8. (i) The benefit under the Acts in cases of total incapacity was originally a weekly payment not exceeding 50 per cent, of the average weekly earnings ofthe workman in the employment in which he was engaged before the accident,subject to a maximum of  1 per week. The War Addition Acts of 1917 and1919J gave a temporary increase of 75 per cent, in the weekly benefit for totalincapacity, but these Acts were repealed by the Act of 1923.5 That Act raised the maximum from  1 to 30s. but the proportion of earnings was left at 50 percent., save that for workmen earning less than 50s. a week the proportion was fixed on a scale varying from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent.(ii) During the present war the weekly compensation has been increased bythe addition of flat rate allowances under the Acts mentioned in paragraph above. The effect of these allowances is to bring the maximum for total in-capacity in the case of the single man up to 35s. a week during the first thirteenweeks, and 40s. thereafter, and in the case of the married man up to 40s. duringthe first thirteen weeks, and 50s. thereafter. A man with children also gets an allowance of 5s. a week in respect of each child under 15 years of age, or up tothe 31st July next following the 16th birthday if still at school. The weeklypayment, including supplementary allowances other than children&apos;s allowances,may not, except for some workers earning less than 50s. weekly, exceed two-thirds of the pre-accident earnings, and, if children&apos;s allowances are paj^able,may not exceed seven-eighths.(iii) In cases of partial incapacity the compensation is a proportion of thedifference between the pre-accident average weekly earnings and what the workman is earning or is able to earn in some suitable employment or businessafter the accident; and the supplementary allowances are payable in the pro-portion which the weekly payment for partial incapacity bears to the weeklypayment to which the workman would be entitled if totally disabled.9. Where the weekly payments have been continued for not less than sixmonths, the employer has the right, on application to the County Court (in* 24 and 25 Geo. 5. C23.f The Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Supplementary Allowances) Act 1040 (3 and 4 Gco. 6,C47) and the Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Temporary Increases) Act, 1943 (6 and 7 Geo ftC49).t 7 &amp; 8 Geo. 5, C42 and 9 &amp; 10 Geo 5, CS3.ii The Workmen&apos;s Compensation Act 1923 (13 &amp; 14 Geo. 5, C42).
Scotland, the Sheriff Court), to have his liability redeemed by payment oflump sum; and he may,at any time agree with the workman to redeem it by a lump sum payment, subject to certain safeguards afforded by registration ofthe agreement in the Court.10. (i) In fatal cases, compensation takes the form of a lump sum the amountof which depends on (a) the workman&apos;s earnings, and (b) the members of his family who were dependent on him at the time of his death and the extent-oftheir dependency. The maximum where only adult dependants are left is  ^..0.Where the workman leaves children under the age of 15 in addition to an adultdependant, an additional sum is payable and the aggregate maximum is  700.(ii) The compensation in fatal cases is not paid direct to the dependants but must be paid into the County Court (or in Scotland, the Sheriff Court) to bedealt with in such manner as the Court thinks best for their benefit.(iii) Where no dependants are left, reasonable expenses of medical attendanceand burial are payable up to a maximum of  15.11. It was originally contemplated that disputes would generally be settledbv informal arbitration by a Committee representative of the employer andhis workmen, or by an arbitrator agreed on by the parties, or by the county court Judge (in Scotland, the Sheriff), a form of procedure which was described by the Attorney-General at the time as &quot; something in the nature of a domesticforum which should settle matters in a cheap and expeditious manner.&quot;Except in the Cumberland and Durham coalfields, where representativecommittees have been set up, this intention has not been realised. Disputesare generally settled, subject to appeal on questions of law. to the Court ofAppeal (in Scotland, the Court of Session) and the House of Lords, by arbitration in the County Court; and this arbitration has developed into a regular legal proceeding.12. The employer has a right, when a workman first claims compensation,and subsequently within prescribed limits, to have him examined by a doctorappointed and paid by the employer. Disputes on the question whether a workman is fit for employment and, if so, to what extent his incapacity is dueto the injury are settled either by a reference through the County Court to a medical Referee appointed by the Home Office, whose certificate is conclusive,or by arbitration.13. Throughout the period since the last war, the present s\-stem has been severely criticised on various grounds and the Government have set up, fromtime to time, departmental committees to report on the working of the Acts.The most important of these was the Holman Gregory Committee which reported in 1920 and recommended a number of far-reaching alterations, manyof which have not, however, been adopted. In December, 1938, a RovalCommission was appointed to examine the law of workmen&apos;s compensation and the relation of the system to other statutory schemes for giving benefitsor assistance to incapacitated or unemployed workmen. It was also directed to advise, in relation to workmen&apos;s compensation, whether any alteration isdesirable in the present position in regard to the civil liability of the employer to pay compensation or damages in respect of injuries due to employment,independently of the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts. The proceedings of theRoyal Commission were suspended in 1940 owing to the war. The commission had by then taken a large amount of evidence, but had made no Report. when sir William Beveridge was invited in 1941 to conduct a comprehensive inquiry into Social Insurance and Allied Services, workmen&apos;s compensation was expresslyincluded within the scope of that inquiry.
II. PROPOSALS IN THE REPORT ON SOCIAL insurance and ALLIED SERVICES14. Sir William Beveridge&apos;s Report * recognises that the existing systemof workmen&apos;s compensation has conferred great benefits in the past. It has enabled the workman in the great majority of cases to get his compensationwithout any serious difficulty and without unreasonable delay; and, as theRrtoort points out, there are other substantial advantages which may becLuned for it. On the other hand, the Report draws attention to a numberof serious disadvantages in the present system. It refers to the formal, con-tentious, and costly method for settlement of disputes; the difficulties of the workman who is not assisted by a trade union or approved society in prosecutinga claim; the possibility of improper pressure on him to reduce his claim orto take up work for which he is not fit; the want of complete security for pay-( ant of compensation; the difficulties of demarcation between industrial and non-industrial cases; the unsatisfactory provision made by lump sum settle-ments; the high costs of administration over parts of the field; the inappropriate-priafeness of the system in cases of industrial diseases which develop over along period or are of a recurrent nature; and the absence of any provision for medical and post-medical rehabilitation of the injured workman.15. The Report recommends that the existing system, which it considers&quot; was based on a wrong principle and has been dominated by a wrong outlook,&quot;should be superseded, and that provision for industrial disability should bemade as part of a unified scheme of social insurance of a contributory character the benefits being paid out of a central fund which would be maintained by contributions payable by the employers and workmen and the State, andwould be administered by a Ministry of Social Security.16. Dealing with the possibility of complete unification with the social insurance scheme the Report says that, &quot; if the matter were being con-sidered in a clear field, it might well he argued that the general principle ofa flat rate of compensation for interruption of earnings adopted for all other forms of interruption, should be applied also without reserve or qualificationto the results of industrial accident and disease, leaving those who felt the needfor greater security to provide by voluntar\- insurance an addition to the Hatrate subsistence guaranteed by the State.&quot; As the Report observes, &quot; if a workman loses a leg in an accident, his needs are the same whether the accidentoccurred in a factory or in the street; if he is killed, the needs of his widowand other dependants are the same, however the death occurred.&quot;17. Nevertheless, the Report recognises that, apart from historical reasons,there are strong grounds for making a distinction in the matter of benefitsbetween industrial and other forms of disability. These grounds are first, that&quot; many industries vital to the community are also specially dangerous and itis essential that men should enter them and desirable therefore that they shouldbe able to do so with the assurance of special provision against their risks . . .for themselves and their families &quot;; secondly, that &quot; a man disabled during thecourse of his employment has been disabled while working under orders&quot;;thirdly, that &quot; only if special provision is made for the results of industrialaccident and disease irrespective of negligence, would it appear possible ason grounds of equity and for the avoidance of controversy it is desirable to limit the employees liability at Common Law to the results of actions for whichhe is responsible morally and in fact, not simply by virtue of some principleof legal liability.&quot;* Cmd. 6404. The main passages in the Report dealing with workmen&apos;s compensationare paragraphs Nos. 77-105, 25S-264, 280-291, 323, 331-336, 353, 360, 366, 393-395 and401 and Appendix A (Memorandum by the Government Actuary) paras. 30 and 30-4Gand Appendix K (Administrative Costs of Various Forms of Insurance).
IO18. The Report concludes that &quot; on balance the reasons for distinguishirbetween industrial accident and disease and other causes of injury, at leastwhere death occurs or disability is prolonged, outweigh tlte reasons on the other side in favour of complete uniformity.&quot; It accordingly proposes certain important departures in respect of benefits (see paragraph 21 below) from theprinciples of the general social insurance scheme.19. (i) On the question how the necessary funds should be obtained theReport accepts the principle of the pooling of risks, which it recognises r naccord with the general trend of public opinion. It refers to the evidence given by the Mineworkers&apos; federation before the Royal Commission on YVork-men&apos;s Compensation in favour of the contributions being paid only by employers,but at a fixed flat rate applicable equally to till industries, but points out&quot; that the pooling of a risk between industries makes it difficult or im-possible to maintain that the cost should be borne by employers only. rnso far as industries depend upon one another, both employers and employesin each industry depend upon all other industries. There is no reason why the employer of a bank clerk or of a domestic servant, rather than the clerk orthe domestic servant himself, should contribute to the cost of accidents inmines and in ships. In so far as there is community of interest between dif-ferent industries making it fair that till industries should share equally in providing for a risk which affects them unequally, this community of interestapplies to the employees as well as to the employers.&quot;(ii) Other arguments advanced in the Report against confining the cost tothe employer are: (a) &quot; If employers are to bear the whole cost it is hard to justify takingthe administration Out of their hands; it is hard, therefore, to give to the responsible Organisations of workmen the chance of taking a part, notin litigation, but in co-operative treatment of industrial disability &quot;;(b) &quot; it is undesirable that while most forms of interruption of earnings are met by benefit to which the insured persons, with others, have contributedand out of a fund in whose stability and economical administration thevare directly interested there should be one form of interruption for whichthe funds are provided wholly by someone else. Such an arrangement will lead to constant pressure to push up the compensation for that particular misfortune, though it needs in reality no more than other formsof misfortune.&quot;20. (i) While accepting broadly the principle of pooling industrial disabilityrisks in the same way as health and unemployment risks, the Report claims that &quot; there is a good social reason for taking a different line, in part at least,about the dangers of industrial accident ancl disease. Though a high risk of accidents is inevitable in mining, shipping and some other industries, it doesnot follow that all accidents are inevitable; the number and severity of accidentscan be diminished or increased by greater or less care on the part of thosewho manage industry.&quot; The Report therefore proposes another importantdeparture from the principles of the security- scheme; namely, that the fundsrequired for benefits in industrial cases should be derived (a) in part only as to about two-thirds from contributions by employers, workers and theState, in the same proportions as for health insurance (five-twelfths each from employers and workmen and one-sixth from the State), and (b) in part as toabout one-third from a special levy on employers engaged in industriesscheduled as hazardous, that is, as having materially more than the normal riskof accident or disease in industry as a whole. The effect would be that thewhole liability in the non-hazardous industries and part of the liability in thehazardous industries would be pooled and the balance, amounting to two-thirds of the excess cost in the hazardous industries, would be met by the special levy on those industries.
(ii) The Report proposes thai there should be set up, at least in everyindustry scheduled as hazardous, a statutory association of employers and employees which, besides concerning itself with matters such as safety and measures for re-habilitation and re-employment within the industry, wouldbe responsible for collecting from individual employers their quotas of thespecial levy required in the industry in accordance with a scheme to be pre-pared by the association and approved by the Minister. Although the asso--;ations would consist of representatives of both sides in the industry, it could^e provided in matters that might be regarded as solely the concern of the employer &quot; that the decision should rest with the employees side alone; this power would make it possible for the employers in each scheduled industry as a body, subject to approval by the Ministry of Social Security, to adoptwhatever system of levy, by individual merit rating or otherwise, they thought, most conducive to the prevention of accidents or disease and the consequent reduction of the levy.&quot;21. The scheme of benefits and the rates provisionally proposed in the report are set out below. The Report assumes that there will be a State scheme of family allowances applicable to all children in a family except the first.(*/) During the first thirteen weeks of incapacity for work the ordinarysecurity benefit would be payable, i.e. 24s. for a single adult man orwoman without dependants or a married man with gainfully occupiedwife, and 40s. for a married man whose wife is not gainfully occupied;there would be reduced rates for single persons under 21 years (20s. ifaged 18-20 and 15s. if aged 16-17 years). A child&apos;s allowance would be payable for the first child and, in the case of the single workman, adependant allowance of lbs. for one adult dependant living with him and not gainfully occupied.Following existing law, benefit would not be payable for the first three days of disablement unless the incapacity lasts for four weeks or more.(b) After the first thirteen weeks of incapacity for work, an industrial pen-sion would be paid equivalent to two-thirds of full-time earnings, but not lessthan the security benefit as under (a), nor more than  3 weekly.(c) For persons partially disabled the pension would be proportionate to theloss of earning power.(d) Lump-sum payments for industrial disability would be restricted to cases in which the Security Office is satisfied on special grounds that suchpayment is in the workman&apos;s interest.(e) In fatal cases a single payment described as an industrial grant, theamount of which would be prescribed by Regulations, would be paidin respect of the widow and of other dependent persons. This grant would be in addition to funeral grant, widow&apos;s and guardian benefits, but these benefits would be taken into account in fixing the amount.(/) Entitlement to benefit would not be conditional upon contributionrecord, as under the general scheme of social insurance.22. The Report further proposes (a) that claims should be dealt with by administrative rather than legalprocedure, with a right of appeal to special local tribunals;(b) that medical treatment should be provided as part of the XationaMedical Service; and(c) that post-hospital rehabilitation should be provided as part of the general service to be organised for this purpose by the Ministry of Labour and national Service.
III. THE GOVERNMENTS VIEWS23. (i) The Government endorse generally the criticisms of the existing system made in the Report. In particular, they consider it to be too corn-plicated and to allow too much scope for contention between the workman(or his trade union) and the employer (or the insurance company or mutualassociation with which he is insured); it thus tends to retard the work-man&apos;s recovery and to prejudice good relations between him and his employe-The cases in which actual legal proceedings are taken form only a small fractio..of the total number, but even so they number some thousands annually, and inaddition there are numerous cases which are settled, by lump sum paymentsor otherwise, without legal proceedings but only after considerable negotiation.Moreover, in the event of a dispute the workman is apt to feel that he is placedon an unequal footing with the employer or his insurers, and to suspect thatthe opposition to his claim is not based on merits but is actuated by motivesof financial interest.(ii) The Government consider it essential to provide that in future claimsshould be made on an independent authority and settled by a procedure lessliable to give rise to friction. This, however, involves a complete change of system. So long as the liability to pay compensation is the liability of the employer it is difficult to justify taking the administration out of his hands, orto substitute for litigation less formal, contentious, and costly methods for thesettlement of doubtful cases.(iii) The principle of placing the liability on the individual employer has hadother unfortunate consequences. For example, the employer generally pro-tects himself by insurance, and the premiums or levies arc fixed according to the risks of the particular industry or class of employment, so that broadly speakingeach industry carries its own risks. The result is that the heaviest liabilityfalls on the hazardous employments, which include certain important industries such as mining and shipping, which have to face foreign competition. It is sometimes claimed that the imposition of the liability on the individual em-ployer conduces to safet\- by giving a direct financial incentive to employers toadopt greater precautions; but as pointed out later (paragraph 31 (ii)) it wouldnot appear that it has, in fact, made any material contribution in this direction.On the other hand, the principle of pooling risks recognises a community ofinterest between different industries. It is a principle which has found accep-tance in other fields, such as unemployment insurance, and which will hewidely extended under the new- scheme of social insurance. The government consider that it shotdd also be adopted for insurance against industrial acci-dent and disease.(iv) The general conclusion reached by the Government is that the time has come when the present system should be replaced by a new scheme, thegeneral structure of which should be based on the accepted principles of social insurance.(v) The Government have considered the possibility of including cases ofindustrial accident or disease in the general scheme of social insurance on thesame terms as disability arising from other causes and superimposing on that scheme a liability on the&apos; individual employer to provide additional benefits inaccordance generally with the provisions of the existing sj&apos;stem. Such anarrangement, however, by perpetuating the principle of the liability of theindividual employer for the purpose of the supplementary benefits, would retain the defects of the existing system. Moreover, the workman would haveto make his case concurrently to two separate authorities under widely differingprocedures. In the view of the Government it would be difficult, if not impossi-ble, to co-ordinate satisfactorily the two systems.
24- (i) Proceeding on the basis that the new scheme should be founded on social insurance principles, the Government agree with the proposals in theReport that the new scheme should be comprehensive in scope that is, thatbroadly speaking it should apply to all persons working under a contract ofservice including non-manual workers without any income limit; that the cost should be borne by a central fund maintained by contributions from employersand workmen, with a contribution from the Exchequer; that claims should bedealt with by administrative rather than legal procedure; and that the responsi-1 ity for the general administration and supervision of the working of thescheme should rest on the authority responsible for the general scheme of social insurance.(ii) The Government recognise that there is a strong case for providing specialbenefits for industrial casualties, both on historical and on other grounds. Inthe industries where most of the industrial accidents occur workmen are exposed( j) far greater risks than citizens in the ordinary walks of life. In coal mining,for example, in every year one workman out of every six engaged in the industrymeets with an accident. The Government think it reasonable therefore tomake special provision for industrial casualties, both in disablement and in fatalcases. Further, they agree that benefits should not be conditional on paymentof a minimum number of contributions.(iii) The Government also concur in the recommendations that the practiceof commuting weekly payments for lump sums should cease, and that provisionfor medical treatment and post-hospital rehabilitation of industrial disabilitycases should be dealt with as part of the national schemes for these purposes.25. The Government, however, for the reasons given in the following para-graphs, are unable to accept certain of the main proposals of the Report. Someof these involve what appear to the Government to be unwarranted departures from the generally accepted principles of social insurance. Others would retainfeatures of the existing system which have proved unsatisfactory in practice and have given rise to much complaint, or would introduce fresh difficultieswhich it should be an aim of the new scheme to avoid. The proposals whichthe Government do not accept are 1(a) the limitation of special rates of benefit for industrial disability to casesof more than thirteen weeks duration;(b) the proposal to relate industrial pensions for long term disability to the earnings of the workman before the accident in cases of total incapacity,and to his earnings both before and after the accident in cases of partialincapacity;(c) the provision proposed for dependants in fatal cases, not by way ofpension, but by a single payment termed &quot; industrial grant &quot;; and Id) the imposition of a special levy upon employers in certain industries t obe scheduled as hazardous.Limitation of special rates of benefit to long term cases.26. (i) The Government do not think it right to limit special provision for casesof industrial disability to cases where disability continues be&apos;ond a specified period. As the Report points out, cases which last longer than thirteen weeksconstitute not more than 10 per cent, of the total. Moreover, the single work-man without dependants has, in fact, normally been receiving under existing legislation 35s. weekly during the first 13 weeks, and the Government think itwould be unreasonable, particularly under a contributory scheme, to requirehim to accept a lower rate such as that of 24s. mentioned in the Report.(ii) One of the special advantages claimed in the Report in support of partialunification with the social insurance scheme is that, under the arrangement
for giving ordinary disability benefit for the first 13 weeks, there would as ;rule be no need to decide whether the accident or disease arose out of and in thecourse of employment. There would, however, be a number of cases where, inview of the possibility that the workman would be disabled for more than13 weeks, it would be necessary to ascertain the cause at an early stage, and inany event, as the Report admits, it would be essential that the Social insuranceAuthority should record and analyse all its experience. In the great majorityof cases, no dispute arises as to the origin of the injury, and the government think that the advantage claimed in the Report on this ground for unificat! 1of rates during an initial period can be exaggerated.27. The Government agree with the proposal that there should be an initial period during which a temporary allowance would be payable, but in their view this allowance ought to be at a higher rate than that proposed for non-industrialdisability-. This allowance should be replaced, if the disablement is likely it-be permanent or prolonged, by an industrial pension, but the Government dv,not favour an arrangement by which the date of transfer from temporary&apos;allowance to pension would be determined entirely without reference to thecondition of the workman or his prospects of recovery. Moreover, if a hard and fast line were drawn at the end of the thirteenth week for transferring casesfrom allowance to pension, it would be difficult to provide for the case mentionedbut not dealt, with in the Report, of a workman who has partially recoveredbefore the end of that period and is fit for some employment. A more flexiblesystem is required under which a pension can be awarded at a date appropriate to the circumstances of the individual case.Relation of industrial pensions to earnings.28. (i) The proposal to relate pensions to earnings contravenes a principle towhich the Government attach importance, and which is otherwise adoptedgenerally in the Report, namely that there should be differentiation in benefitsonly according to family responsibilities, and that subject to provision forsuch responsibilities, there should be uniform flat rates of benefit in return foruniform flat rates of contribution. Further, the assessment of workmen&apos;compensation by reference to earnings has given rise, as indicated below, to serious difficulties and objections.(ii) The calculation of the average weekly earnings over a period beforethe accident has been repeatedly&apos; criticised on the ground that the earningsso determined do not necessarily represent the normal earning capacity of the workman; in times of full employment and overtime, as at present, they go beyond, and in times of trade depression they fall below, his normal earning capacity. It is urged that it is hard on a workman who meets with an accidentwhen his earnings are relatively low that he should be penalised by receivingcorrespondingly low compensation, and that the sense of hardship is accentuatedif he sees that another workman in the same employment, who has sufferedan injury similar to his own, but at a time of good trade, is receiving com-pensation at a higher rate.(iii) Alternative methods for calculating earnings have been put forward,the underlying idea being to base the compensation on a hypothetical figurerepresenting what the workman might be expected to earn under normal con-ditions. Such a procedure would, however, introduce a great element of guess-work, and would be likely to result in more frequent disputes. discussions with representatives of the employers and workmen have not disclosed any satisfactory solution of this problem.(iv) Another possibility which has been examined is that of fixing compen-sation by reference not to actual earnings but to the standard rate of remunera-tion applicable to the employment. There are, however, many industries andemployments in which there is no standard rate; and in others the standard
rate is not applicable to all classes of workmen employed in the industry, orvaries in different districts, and the Government are advised that such a method would give rise to even greater difficulties than the present system.(v) Further, the assessment of the weekly payment in cases of partialincapacity on the basis of a proportion of the difference between the pre-accident earnings of the workman and what he is earning or is able to earnin some suitable employment or business after the accident, has given rise tonuch dispute and has often had most unfortunate results. In many casesthe workman has felt that the work offered to him was not suitable for his capacity or would otherwise be prejudicial to his complete recovery, or he hasfelt aggrieved because, though his compensation has been reduced, no work ofthe kind for which he is fitted has, in fact, been available. Or again, he hasbeen reluctant to resume his old employment or undertake new employmentifrom fear that his compensation would be reduced and that, if he failed tomake good owing to his disability, he would find it difficult, if not impossible,to get his compensation restored to its previous level. In such cases the psycho-logical effect is to delay the recovery of the workman.(vi) Similar considerations have sometimes operated to make the workmanreluctant to submit to any rehabilitation treatment, and the Delevingne * andTomlinson t Committees on Rehabilitation have both commented on thepossible adverse effects on workmen who have only partially recovered, ofa system under which the provision of light work may be regarded chieflyas a means of reducing the compensation. The former Committee recom-mended (page 57 of their Report) &quot; that an injured workman&apos;s capacity for light work which can be reached at a certain stage of his treatment should beregarded not from the point of view of compensation and as a reason for reduction of the compensation, but solely as a means by which the completerestoration of his working capacity can be furthered.&quot; The Tomlinson Com-mittee (paragraph 44 of their Report) while accepting the view that light work as an aid to restoration may, in some cases and subject to certain conditions,more suitably be given in industry than in a special centre, strongly deprecated&quot; a system under which the provision of light employment is treated not aspart of the rehabilitation process but merely as a factor in determining thequantum of compensation.&quot;(vii) Another grievance has been that, whenever there is an increase in wage rates resulting in increased earnings, the weekly payments of compen-sation to partially disabled workmen are reduced under the method prescribed in the Acts by half the amount of the increase, so that the workman does not get the full benefit of the addition. An attempt was made in the Workmen&apos;compensation Act, 1943, to mitigate this complaint by providing that, whenevera change takes place in the rates of remuneration in the class of employmentin which an injured workman was previously employed, his average weekly earnings can be recalculated, at the instance of either the employer or the workman, on the basis of what his earnings would have been had the changedrates been in operation over the relevant period before the injury. As a resultof this provision, which applies to total as well as to partial disablement cases,many disabled workmen have been able to get their sveekiy payments increased;and, so long as wages tend to increase, this provision benefits the workman.But in the event of a fall in wage levels, the compensation rates over a wide field would be subject to reduction, and the Government doubt whether any scheme which provides for fluctuations of benefit according to whether wagesrise or fall would in the long run be found to be satisfactorj&apos;.* Inter-Departmental Committee on the Rehabilitation of Persons Injured by Accidents,1939.t Inter-Departmental Committee on the Rehabilitation and Resettlement of disabled persons, 1943 (Cmd. 6415).
29. (i) The principle of providing compensation based on loss of earning capacity, which the Report proposed to retain in all cases of more than thirteenweeks&apos; duration, is the cause of all the difficulties referred to in paragraph 28above and in the Governments view these difficulties are insuperable so longas this principle is retained. If necessitates in all such cases, whether of totalor of partial incapacity, the calculation of pie-accident earnings, and in casesof partial incapacity it necessitates also the calculation of post-accident earning capacity. This method of assessing compensation moreover must necessarily be accompanied by a system of review at any time of the weekly payment iiorder to ascertain &quot;whether (u) incapacity still exists, and if so, to what extent,and (b) whether the loss of earning capacity is properly ascribable to the injury or to other causes.(ii) The Government have come to the conclusion that the only satisfactory solution is to abandon the principle of awarding compensation in respect of.loss of earning capacity, and to adopt two completely new features for the assessment of industrial pensions.   These features are: (a) to provide, in accordance with the generally accepted principle of social insurance, uniform flat rates of pension without regard to pre-accidentearnings, but taking account of family responsibilities; and(b) to give benefit according to the degree of disablement due to the injuryin the same way as is done under war pensions schemes, namely through an assessment by a Medical Board of the condition of the workmanresulting from the injury as compared with the condition of a normalhealthy person of the same age anil sex.(iii) The new principle of giving compensation for the injury itself and not for loss of earning capacit\- is a cardinal feature of the Government proposals.It has the following advantages: (a) By getting rid of the distinction hitherto drawn between total andpartial incapacity for work, and giving the workman who has sufferedan injury causing permanent or prolonged disablement a pension com-mensurate with the assessed degree of disablement, irrespective of hisearning capacity, it eliminates as a cause of dispute the questions whetheror to what extent the workman has recovered his earning capacity.(b) It removes the grievance that an improvement in the workman&apos;s earning capacity results in an automatic reduction of his compensation.(c) It avoids any ground for suspicion on the part of the workman that heis being pressed to return to unsuitable work with a view to reductionof his compensation, and the fear that if he returns to work he willjeopardise his right to further compensation; and it should remove anyhesitation he maj- feel in submitting to a course of rehabilitation treat-ment.   It should thus promote a more speedy recovery.(d) It helps to meet the complaint often made that no compensation isprovided for mutilation or disfigurement except in so far as it causesloss of earning capacity.(iv) The Government have considered whether in conjunction with the newprinciple of assessment there might be rates of benefit varying according tocompartments of earnings, so that the higher paid workman would receivebenefit at a higher rate than the lower paid workman. It is, however, impos-sible to reconcile this differentiation of benefit with uniform contributions, andit would involve the calculation of earnings, the objections to which have been set out above. Further, if there were only a few compartments there wouldbe complaints.of hardship in cases where the workman&apos;s earnings just failedto qualify him for a higher rate.of pension which others, perhaps in the sameemployment, might attain.   On the other hand, a large number of compart-
ments would involve a precise calculation of earnings in a large number ofcases. The possibility has also been considered of differentiation betweengrades (e.g. manager, foreman, skilled or other workman), but as there are no definite and uniform grades recognised throughout industry, any such demar-cation would be entirely arbitrary.(v) The Government appreciate that in some cases of higher paid workmen,benefits at the uniform flat rates proposed in the Government scheme (para---aphs 38-46) would not work out so favourably as payments under the scheme proposed in the Report based on loss of earning capacity, but they are satisfiedthat, taking into account the new principle of assessment, the benefits underthe Government scheme will in the great majority of disability&apos; cases be morefavourable. It should be borne in mind that experience of the war pensions schemes shows that a large proportion of pensioners whose disablement is assessed at 100 per cent are capable of substantial earnings.(vi) The Government believe that arrangements on the lines proposed, whichhave worked satisfactorily in the case of civilian war injuries, can be appliedwithout difficulty to industrial injury though in some classes of industrial disease their application will call for special provisions.Fatal Cases.30. The Government agree that special provision should be made in fatal casesresulting from industrial accident or disease, but they do not agree with theproposal in the Report that this provision should be by way of the grant of a lump sum, in addition to social insurance benefits but taking account of them.They do not regard lump sum payments, even if administered under strict control, as a satisfactory method of assuring an income. Further, if the lump sum were to be of the order contemplated in the Government Actuary&apos;s Memo-randum on the finance of the proposals (an average of  300 where a totaldependant is left see Appendix A to the Report), they think that the pro-vision might often fall short of what is necessary and appropriate. The Govern-ment consider that provision for dependants in fatal cases should be by way ofpension or weekly allowance.Special Levy on Employers in the Hazardous Industries.31. (i) The fourth proposal in the Report which the Government cannot acceptis the proposal that a substantial part of the fund for payment of benefits shouldbe found by means of a special levy on employers in the hazardous industries.This proposal involves a departure from the principle of all &quot; standing-in &quot;with complete pooling of risks a principle which, as the Report points out, hasfound widespread acceptance and is adopted generally in other branchesof social insurance. Hazardous industries are not hazardous because theemployers in them are less active in the prevention of accidents than other employers, or because the workmen in those industries are less careful than otherworkmen. They are hazardous because of the nature of the employment andthe inherent risks. The proposal needs, therefore, strong grounds to justify it,particularly as the special levy would fall most heavily on certain important industries which have to meet foreign competition.(ii) The main ground advanced in the Report for this departure is that by introducing &quot; merit rating,&quot; i.e. fixing the employees contribution accordingto the risks either in particular industries or in individual undertakings, a realfinancial incentive would be given to employers to take measures for theprevention of accidents. The Government are not satisfied that merit ratingbased on the risks in particular industries would have this effect. Merit ratingon this basis is, in fact, the general practice on which insurance against work-men&apos;s compensation risks is conducted under the present system in the hazardous
* Cmd. 2208.t Cmd. 816.industries, and it is applied not merely to a part but to the whole of the chargeinvolved by the Acts; but it would not appear from the Reports of the Depart-mental Committees of 1904* and 19207 which enquired into the operationof the Acts, or from any other information in the possession of the Government,that this practice has made any significant contribution to safety. It must beborne in mind that a substantial number A accidents are due to causes outsidethe employees control many, for example, are attributable to risks inherent in the conditions of the employment, as in the mining industry where man&quot;accidents occur through the operation of released natural forces. Moreovt.,the whole charge in respect of industrial compensation is, and under any new scheme will continue to be, a comparatively small item in relation to wages andother costs of production. As regards merit rating according to risks in individual undertakings, this system might, if it were possible to introduce it onan extensive scale, prove more effective, though even so, the variation of premiums or levies would be of small amount. Having regard, however, to tinwide differences in conditions between different works, due largely to causesoutside the employer&apos;s control, the Government do not think that any systemof this kind could be operated on an equitable basis, and they feel sure that thecomplication and expense involved in an)&apos; such system would be out of all proportion to the results likely to be achieved.(iii) The proposal in the Report is to define hazardous industries as &quot; thosehaving materially more than the normal risk of accident and disease in industry as a whole.&quot; There are wide variations in the hazards of different branches ofthe same industry, some processes being hazardous and others not: and, more-over, industrial hazards are not constant but are subject to frequent change.It follows that there would be great difficulties of definition, and there would consequently be much scope for contention as to whether particular industries or branches of industries were rightly included in, or excluded from, the hazard-ous list at any given time. Complications would also arise from the existenceof large undertakings engaged in a wide variety of production, including pro-cesses belonging to different industries, some hazardous and some comparativelysafe.(iv) If a special levy on employers in hazardous industries were adopted, it isdifficult to see why it ought not to be extended to the workmen engaged in those industries. The prevention of accidents in these as in other industries dependsin large part on the care exercised by the workmen, and it may be argued thatin their case, as in the case of the employers, it is desirable to emphasise theneed for constant vigilance.(v) For these reasons the Government do not consider that the proposal fora special levy is justified. Their view is that for further progress in preventionof accidents reliance must be placed on other means, such as the developmentof the standards set up under the Factories, Mines and other safety enact-ments, and increasing co-operation between employers and workmen. In anumber of hazardous industries joint machinery for dealing with safety ques-tions already exists sometimes under statutory powers and sometimes throughvoluntary action and the Government would welcome the establishment ofsuch joint bodies in all industries in which there are substantial risks of indus-triai accident and disease.(vi) Thej- accordingly propose that, following the principle in Health and unemployment Insurance, the whole cost of the benefits under the scheme should be borne by weekly contributions from employers and workmen,with a contribution from the Exchequer, without discrimination betweenindustries.
32. (i) The following is an outline of the new scheme proposed by the Govern-ment. Several important questions remain to he settled as for example, thespecial provisions which will be required to adjust the Scheme in its applicationto seamen and to cases of industrial disease; there are also many details whichwill require further consideration in the working out of the full scheme, and discussion with representatives of employers and workmen will be necessary.(ii) In view of the special benefits which it is proposed to provide, the Schemecannot be unified with the general scheme of social insurance, but must betreated as a separate branch of social insurance.(iii) The benefits provided under the Scheme will take the place of the cash benefits payable under the general scheme in cases of disability and of the widows, orphan&apos;s and guardian&apos;s benefits in cases of death. No funeral benefit will be payable under this Scheme: this will be provided by the death grantproposed under the general scheme of social insurance.Scope of Scheme.33. (i) The Scheme will cover broadly all persons working under a contract of service or apprenticeship, and will correspond closely with Class I ofthe classification under the general social insurance scheme. It will not applyto those under school-leaving age, but otherwise it is intended to cover all classesof persons covered by the existing Acts and it will apply to non-manual workerswithout any income limit. No provision is contemplated for &quot; contracting out &quot; schemes such as are permitted under the existing Acts.(ii) The Scheme will apply to personal injury by accident arising out of andin the course of employment j and to specified industrial diseases. It is pro-posed to adhere generally to the principles at present recognised in extending the Acts to diseases due to industrial employment. The Government are aware of the criticisms which have been made of the phrase &quot; arising out of andin the course of employment,&quot; but they do not think any other form of wordswould be found in practice to be more satisfactory. They consider it essentialto provide that there should be a causal connection between the injury and theemployment.(iii) It is also proposed that the provision in the existing Act for persons engaged in rescue work in mines should be enlarged in scope so as to coveraccidents to persons engaged in rescue work and other specified classes ofemergency work in connection with industrial undertakings generally.(iv) The present Act provides that if it is proved that the injury is attribu-table to the serious and wilful misconduct of the workman a.ny compensationclaimed in respect of that injury shall, unless the injury results in death orserious and permanent disablement, be disallowed. It is proposed to include asimilar provision in the new Scheme.Finance.34. (i) An Industrial Injury Insurance Fund will be set up out of whichall benefits and administrative charges will be paid. The Fund will be main-tained by weekly contributions from emplo&apos;ers and workmen, with a contri-bution from the Exchequer.(ii) Employers and workmen will pay the same weekly contributions. Equalcontributions will be required for the main benefits under the general schemeof social insurance, and from the workman&apos;s point of view it would seemIV.-GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS FOR INDUSTRIAL INJURYINSURANCE SCHEME
desirable that lie should lx* on an equality in this respect with the employer.Moreover, it is proposed (paragraphs .35 and 36) that workers and employers should share equally in the development and administration of the Scheme,being equally represented on the Advisory Committee or Council and on thelocal appeal tribunals, and equal contributions are a natural, if not necessary,corollary of such arrangements. Under this arrangement, employers and workmen will each contribute five-twelfths of the cost and the Exchequer will contribute one-sixth.(iii) Women will receive the same basic rates of benefit as men, but sincethe allowances proposed for dependants see paragraphs 40 and 46 will be payable mainly to or in respect of dependants of male workmen, the rates of contribution for women will (as under the general scheme) be lower than those for men. There will also be lower rates of contributions with lower rates of benefits for juveniles under 18.(iv) The contributions will be collected by stamp, together with the contri-&apos;butions under the general scheme of social insurance. The employer will paythe joint contribution and will have the right to deduct the workman&apos;s sharefrom his wages.(v) Benefit will not depend on a contribution qualification.(vi) The contributions will not be payable when the workman is incapacitatedfor work or unemployed.General Administration.35. (i) Although the Scheme will be separate from the general scheme of social insurance, the administration of the two schemes should be integratedto the fullest possible extent; and, for this reason and on grounds of economy,the Government propose that the general administration and supervision ofthe working of the Industrial Injury Insurance Scheme should be entrusted tothe Authority responsible for the general scheme that is, the Minister of social insurance see para 152 of Part I of this paper, and that the offices and staffset up under that scheme should be used wherever possible.(ii) The Government also consider it important to provide for the collabora-tion of industry in the development and administration of the Scheme, andthey propose that an Advisory Committee or Council should be set up on which employers and workmen would be equally represented, for the purpose of advising the Minister on important questions of policy and administrationreferred to them.(iii) Questions as to insurability7 and liability to contribute will be settled,as under the general scheme of social insurance, by the Minister subject to theright of the Minister in special circumstances to submit the question for decision to the High Court (in Scotland, the Court of Session). A partyaggrieved by a decision of the Minister will have a right of appeal to the HighCourt (in Scotland, the Court of Session) on questions of law.Procedure for Settlement of Claims36. (i) All claims will, in the first instance, be dealt with by an IndustrialPensions Officer located in the local Social Insurance office, one of whose dutieswill be to advise and assist applicants for benefits under the Scheme in the submission of their claims. Claims in respect of disablement will normally be met on an application by or on behalf of the workman (giving such particulars of the injury and family responsibilities as may be prescribed, and accom-panied by a certificate from his medical adviser or hospital authority) and onconfirmation of the injury by the employer. The workman will continue asat present to be under an obligation to give notice of his injury to the employer and the employer will be required to report the injury to the Pensions Officer.
In cases of doubt the Pensions Officer will make such further enquiry as may seem desirable, and will have the right to require the applicant to submit toan examination by an appointed Medical Officer. In cases of industrial disease,it may be necessary to require, in lieu of a certificate from the workman&apos;s owndoctor, a certificate from the Examining Surgeon appointed under the FactoriesAct or some other specially appointed medical officer or authority. It is contemplated that the certification of silicosis, asbestosis, and other forms ofoneumoconiosis will be carried out as at present by a special medical board,.nd similar machinery may be necessary for other industrial diseases.(ii) The decision of the Industrial Pensions Officer on questions of entitle-ment (such as e.g. whether the injury arose out of and in the course of em ploy-men t ; whether the disablement or death was due to the injury or whether it was due to serious and wilful misconduct), and, except so far as may be otherwise provided, on other questions arising in connection with the determination of claims, will be subject to appeal to a local appeal tribunal, on which employersand workmen will be equally represented, presided over by an independent chairman with legal qualifications. It will also be open to the PensionsOfficer to refer any such question to the local appeal tribunal without himselfgiving a decision. Where in a particular case medical issues are involved or are likely to arise, provision will be made for one or more medical practitionersto join the tribunal either as members or in an advisory capacity.(iii) There will be further rights of appeal to an Industrial Injury InsuranceCommissioner on leave being given either by the Chairman of the local appeal tribunal or by the Commissioner on questions of law or on such other questions as may be prescribed. The Commissioner will be appointed by the Crown,and his decision will be final. Provision will also be made for the appointmentof one or more deputy Commissioners with power to act in place of theCommissioner.(iv) The medical assessment for pension, when the workman&apos;s condition isconsidered to warrant it, will be made by a medical board, and it is contem-plated that the Medical Boards of the Ministry of Pensions might be utilised for this purpose. There will be rights of appeal against a final assessment,or in certain cases against an interim assessment, to a tribunal consisting of a chairman of a local appeal tribunal and two medical practitioners.(v) Any arrangements necessary for continued medical supervision will bemade by the Ministry of Social Insurance. It will be the concern of theMinistry to see that the workman receives any medical treatment or course oftraining available to him under the national services which may be appropriate in his case, and there will be an obligation on the workman to undergo such treatment or training.Benefits.37. (i) In framing the benefits set out below, the Government have had regard to the provision made in the existing Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts,the war pensions schemes, and the proposals for the general social insurancescheme. The main benefits in industrial disablement cases will consist of an industrial injury allowance followed, in cases of permanent or prolongeddisablement, by an industrial pension. In both cases allowances will bepaid in respect of family responsibilities.(ii) In view of the Government scheme of family allowances special provision will be made in industrial disablement cases for the first child only.(iii) The Appendix to this Paper contains (a) a comparison between therates of injury allowance and pension for 100 per cent, disablement for adultsproposed under this Scheme and the rates for total incapacity under the
Beveridge plan and under the existing Acts, and (b) a comparison between thebenefits in fatal cases under this Scheme, the Beveridge plan and the existing acts.Industrial Injury Allowance.38. An injury allowance will be payable so long as the workman remains inca-pacitated for work as the result of an industrial injury, unless it is replaced b&quot;an industrial pension. The rate of the allowance will be initially 35s. weekly,but if the workman has not previously been assessed for pension it will lieraised at the end of the thirteenth week to the industrial pension rate for100 per cent, disablement. As under the existing practice of workmen&apos;compensation, the injury allowance will not be payable in respect of the first three days if incapacity lasts less than four weeks.Industrial Pension.&apos; 39. (i) Where the disablement is likely to be permanent or prolonged, the in-jury allowance will be replaced by an industrial pension based on the degree of disablement caused by the injury as assessed by the medical board. an industrial pension will, unless the workman&apos;s condition permits of a finalassessment of the extent of the disablement, be awarded on a temporary basis until a final assessment can be made. If at any time a workman ceases to be incapacitated for work but still suffers some disablement on account ofthe injury, he will be entitled to apply for a pension to be assessed forthwith.(ii) The rate of pension proposed where the degree of disablement due to the injury is assessed at 100 per cent, will be 40s. weekly. Where the degree of disablement is assessed at less than 100 per cent the pension will be propor-tionate to the degree of disablement.(iii) Following the practice in war pensions, special provision will be madefor the pensioner who notwithstanding remedial measures remains, by reasonof his industrial injury, virtually unemployable. In such cases a personalsupplement of 10s. weekly will be provided.*Family Allowances.40. The following allowances will be payable, in addition to the injury allowanceor pension.(i) An allowance will be payable in respect of a wife to whom the workmanwas married at the date of the injury and who was either residing with orwholly or mainly dependent on him. Where the injury allowance is 35s. the allowance for a wife will be 8s. 9d. weekly, and where it is 40s., or where a100 per cent, disablement pension is awarded, it will be 10s. weekly.(ii) An allowance will be payable in respect of a first child of the workmanwho is wholly or mainly dependent on him. Where the injury allowance is35s., the allowance for the child will be 5s.; and where it is 40s., or where a 100 percent, disablement pension is awarded, it will be 7s. 6d. weekly. The allowance will be payable up to the age of 15 and thereafter so long as the child remainsunder full time instruction in a school (or is an apprentice) up to the 31st Julyfollowing the 16th birthday. &quot; Child &quot; will include a child of the workmanwho was born not later than 9 months after the date of the injury, or a stepchildwhose mother or father was married to the workman before the injury, or a child legally adopted by the workman before the injury.(iii) Where a pension at less than the 100 per cent, rate is awarded, allow-ances proportionate to the pension will be payable in respect of the wife and first child.
(iv) Where no wife&apos;s allowance is payable the workman will be entitled, so.long as he remains incapable of work as a result of the injury, to claim an allowance, at the rate for a wife, in respect of one adult person in respect ofwhom a dependant allowance would be payable under the general scheme of social insurance in cases of ordinary disability. Thus a workman will be ableto claim an allowance (subject to the same conditions as will apply under thegeneral social insurance scheme) in respect of an invalid father or widowedmother, or adult sister or daughter, or a housekeeper, whether resident ornon-resident, who looks after his dependent children.(v) Where a personal allowance is awarded in respect of virtual unemploy-ability, allowances at the 100 per cent rate in respect of a wife and first childwill be payable irrespective of the date of marriage or the date of birth of the child.Maintenance in Hospital and Treatment Allowance.41. (i) A workman admitted to hospital for treatment will be entitled underthe new National Health Service to be maintained in hospital without charge.It is proposed under the general social insurance scheme that the benefits under that scheme shall be reduced during maintenance in hospital in respect ofhome savings, after twenty-eight days. Under the existing Workmen&apos;s Com-pensation Acts the weekly payment to the disabled workman has not been subject to reduction during his maintenance in hospital and in view of this itis proposed that the workman disabled by industrial injury and removed to hospital shall receive his cash benefits in full without deduction, as part of thespecial benefits provided for industrial casualties.(ii) Where an industrial pensioner has to re-enter a hospital or institutionfor further approved treatment for disability due to his injury, his pension willwhilst undergoing such treatment be at the 100 per cent, rate with full family allowances related to his responsibilities at the time, but the pension will besubject to a deduction of 10s. a week in respect of home savings.Allowance for constant attendance.42. Where a workman has been awarded an industrial pension for disablementassessed at 106 per cent., and needs constant attendance on account of the dis-ablement, he may be awarded a special allowance at a weekly rate notexceeding 20s.Women.43. Women will be entitled to injury allowance and pension at the same basic rates as men. A married woman whose husband is wholly or mainly dependenton her earnings and incapable of self-support will be entitled to an allowance for her dependent husband (at the rate for a wife) together with an allowance in respect of a first child, subject to the conditions applicable to the first child of a male workman. Where no husband&apos;s allowance is payable, a woman willbe entitled to claim an allowance for a dependant on the conditions applicableto a male workman.Juveniles.44. The rates of benefit for unmarried workmen under 18 years of age will behalf the rates for an adult, to be raised to the adult rate on attaining 18 yearsof age.   Any dependant&apos;s allowances payable will be at the full rates.Minor Injuries.45. Where an injury results in only a minor degree of disablement, provision will be made for a final settlement by an award of a gratuity, or of a temporary
allowance at a special rate with or without a final gratuity. If successiveinjuries occur resulting eventually in substantial disablement, the case will be reviewed on the basis of the disablement resulting from the combinedinjuries.Pensions and Allowances in Fatal Cases.46. The following provision will be made for the payment of pensions and allowances to widows and children and to other dependants of the workmansubject to the conditions set out in each case and to the general conditions asto dependency mentioned in sub-paragraph (ix) below.(i) The widow of a deceased workman, who was married to him previous tothe injury&apos; and was resident with him at the time of death, will receive (a) if sheis 50 years of age or over, or being under that age has the care of a child of the workman or is incapable of self-support, a pension of 30s. weekly and, (6) inother cases, a pension of 20s. weekly. If she would have qualified under thegeneral scheme of social insurance for a widow&apos;s benefit at a higher rate for an initial period following the death, an allowance at that rate will be payable for a similar period and pension will begin when the allowance ends. Wherea widow under 50 years of age is awarded a pension at the 30s. rate becauseshe has the care of a child of the workman, the pension will continue at this rate when the child ceases to be qualified for allowance if she has then attained the age of 50 years. In the case of a widow who was separated from the workman, provision will be made for the award of a pension in accordance withany payment she has been receiving or entitled to receive from him, subjectto a maximum of the appropriate rate above. On re-marriage, the pension will cease but there will be a marriage gratuity equal to one year&apos;s pension.(ii) An allowance of 7s. 6d. weekly will be payable in respect of a first child of the workman (child being defined as in paragraph 40(h)). As under thegeneral scheme of social insurance, there will be a weekly allowance of 12s. (ofwhich 5s. will be provided by the Exchequer) for each child who becomes anorphan (i.e. a child both of whose parents are dead) by the death of the workman.(iii) Where the workman was in receipt at the time of death of an allowance in respect of virtual unemployability, the widow&apos;s pension and the allowance inrespect of a first child will be payable irrespective of the date of marriage or thedate of the birth of the child.(iv) A widower whose wife was married to him previous to her injury andwas resident with him at the time of her death will be eligible for a pension of2os. weekly, if he is incapable of self-support.(v) A pension will be payable, whether or not a widow&apos;s pension is payable,to a parent who is incapable of self-support. The maximum rate of pension forone parent will be 20s. weekly or, if both parents qualify, 30s. weekly.(vi) Where no pension is payable to a widow or a parent, one other adultmember of the deceased workman&apos;s family who was residing with him at thetime of the injury, will be eligible for a pension if incapable of self-support.The maximum rate of pension will be 20s. weekly.(vii) Where no pension is payable under the foregoing provisions, a woman,whether or not a member of the deceased workman &apos;s family, who was residingwith the workman at the time of the injury, will be eligible for temporary pen-sion if she has the care of his child or children. The maximum rate will be20s. weekly and the pension will be payable so long as at least one child is withinthe qualifying age for allowance under the Scheme.(viii) Any adult member of the deceased workman&apos;s family who is noteligible for any pension under this Scheme will be eligible for a temporary allowance of 36s. weekly for 13 weeks.
(ix) The foregoing pensions and allowances will be subject to the condition that the claimant was wholly or mainly dependent on the workman at the timeof the injury and either continued to be so dependent up to the date of deathor would but for the injury have been so dependent. The widow and the firstchild will be deemed to have complied with this condition and will be treatedas wholly dependent on the deceased if they were resident with him at the timeof death; and some further modification as to the requirement of dependency atthe time of the injury will be necessary in the cases referred to in sub-paragraph(iii) above. The maximum rate in sub-paragraphs (v), (vi) and (vii) will begiven where the dependant had been wholly maintained by the workman; inother cases the amount will be proportionate to the degree of maintenancewhich had been given. In the case of a female dependant, the pension will cease on subsequent marriage. A person incapable of self-support means aperson prevented by reason of physical or mental infirmity of a permanentor prolonged nature from supporting himself.Cost47. (i) It is estimated that before the war the cost of workmen&apos;s compensationpaid by employers, excluding administrative cost, was about  10 millions per annum, and that the total cost including administrative cost was about 13 millions. Wartime legislation is estimated to have increased the cost ofcompensation to about  17 millions, and it will also have increased the adminis-trative cost to a substantial, though not to a proportionate, extent.(ii) Assuming rates of wages at about 25 per cent in excess of their levelin 193S, and the restoration of peacetime conditions before the introductionof the social security scheme, the Government Actuary estimated that thecost of benefits for industrial cases under the proposals in the Report (exclud-ing administrative cost) would be about  15 millions per annum, of which 10 millions was to be found by tripartite contribution and  5 millions by aspecial levy on employers in the hazardous industries (see Appendix A to theReport).(iii) It is difficult to make a comparison between the cost of the government proposals and the cost under the existing Acts or under the proposals in theReport, since the Government Scheme is based on flat rates of benefit whichare not related to earnings. The benefits under the Government scheme would, however, in some important respects be substantially more generous tothe workman than those recommended in the Report. For example, during thefirst 13 weeks of incapacity&apos; the single man would get 35s. per week insteadof 24s. The cost of industrial pensions also will in most cases be substantially greater owing to the new method of assessment proposed. The Report did not fully specify the provision contemplated for fatal cases, but it seems clearthat the cost of the pensions proposed under the new scheme will be substan-tially higher. Whilst, therefore, it is impossible to make an accurate forecast of the total cost of benefits under the new scheme, the Government are advised that it will materially exceed the cost of the proposals in the Report and islikely to be of the order of  20 millions a year.(iv) The cost of administration under the Scheme expressed as a percentageof the cost of benefits should, over the whole field, be lower than under theexisting system. The Government are advised that pending experience of theworking of the Scheme it would be wise to allow 15 per cent of the cost of benefits for administrative charges.(v) Assuming the cost of benefits under the Government proposals to be ofthe order of  20 millions, and taking a further  3 millions as the cost of ad-ministration, the Government are advised that allowing for excusals in respectof disability and unemployment, the weekly contribution required for men
will be 6d. and that for women 4c!. If the contribution is divided equally between employers and workers as proposed in paragraph 34, the weekly ratefor each will be 3d. for men and 2d. for women. The rates for boys and girlsunder 18 years will be half the rates for men and women. These contributions would provide five-sixths of the income of the Fund, the remaining one-sixthbeing contributed by the Exchequer.Overlapping of Benefits with other Schemes.48. The question of overlapping benefits is dealt with in Part I of this paper.One such case where adjustment will be required is that of the industrialpensioner who qualifies for sickness or unemployment benefit; another is theindustrial pensioner, who becomes qualified for a retirement pension. Similarlyin fatal cases, overlapping will occur if the dependants qualify for sickness or ,unemployment benefit or retirement pension. These, however, are only examples of the many types of case where benefits may overlap, and the Governmenthave reserved the treatment of all such cases for further consideration.Medical Treatment and Rehabilitation.49. The medical treatment and rehabilitation of injured workmen and post-hospital rehabilitation and training will be provided as part of the general medical and post-hospital rehabilitation services organised by the health departments and by the Ministry of Labour and National Service respec-tively, though it may be reasonable that a contribution from the industrial injury Insurance Fund should be made towards the cost of the latterservice. Close contact will clearly have to be maintained between theMinistry of Social Insurance and the Departments responsible for these services with a view to ensuring that the injured workman secures full benefit from them. It is important that there should be consultation between the ministry and these Departments on all major questions affecting the treatment of indus-trial pensioners. The Ministry should be able to furnish the Departments with much useful information and advice as the result of experience of the Scheme,and of the comprehensive statistics which it will have collected as to the incidenceand effects of industrial accident and disease.Prevention of Accidents.50. It is not contemplated that the Ministry of Social Insurance shouldhave any responsibility for the prevention of industrial accidents anddiseases, but its position will give it a unicjue opportunity to contributevaluable information in this sphere and in this and other ways it will be ableto promote and assist research. It will be one of its functions to survey andanalyse the incidence and effects of industrial accidents and diseases over thewhole of the industrial field.Application of the new Scheme to past cases.51. (i) The Report raises the question of the application of the new Schemeto cases occurring before the commencement of the Scheme. It is clear thatin any event, as recognised in the Report, there can be no re-opening of caseswhere the liability for weekly payments has been redeemed by payment of a lump sum. Nor would it seem practicable to adjust the provisions of the new scheme to fatal cases where a lump sum has been paid into Court and whollyor partially disbursed for the benefit of the widow and other dependants,and where the widow will, subject to re-marriage, be continuing to draw apension under the Widows, Orphans and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act.
(ii) As regards cases of prolonged disability where the workman is stillreceiving weekly payments, the Report, whilst admitting the practical diffi-eulties, suggested two alternatives for consideration:(rt) that the existing payment should continue to be provided as at present,the Social Insurance Fund paying separately the additions involved in thenew scales; or(b) that the Social insurance Fund should take over the whole responsibilityf and make weekly payments to the workman at the new rates.1 (iii) Both these alternatives would involve serious practical difficulties-There is a fundamental difference between the methods of fixing the weeklypayments under the existing Acts and under the new Scheme. It would benecessary to make a medical assessment in each case in accordance with thenew principle, but the Government are advised that it would be a matter of extreme difficulty after a lapse, in a large number of cases, of many years fora ivledical Board to determine the degree of disablement due to the injuryeither at the time of the injury or at the date of their examination. Further,as regards (b) it would be necessary, as the Report points out, for the CentralFund to take over in respect of each case such reserves of insurance companies,mutual indemnity associations and individual employers as have been ear-marked for the purpose of the liability. While in the case of Insurance companies and some Mutual Indemnity Associations adequate reserves are no doubt set aside to cover the liability under the existing Acts, there will be cases wherethe provision made will be inadequate, and the Authority responsible for thenew Scheme would have to ascertain the capitalised liability of the employer and be given power to recover any deficiency from the employer or his insurers.(iv) Since the Report was published the compensation payments under theActs have been substantially increased by recent legislation and the new ratesprovided by the Workmen&apos;s Compensation (Temporary Increases) Act, 1943,have diminished the importance of the transfer of past cases to the fund the Government have come to the conclusion that the right course is to leavethe liability in past cases on the employer, in accordance with the existing acts. These Acts, including the Workmen&apos;s Compensation (TemporaryIncreases) Act, 1943, would be continued in force for the purpose, subject toany appropriate adjustment in respect of family allowances provided under the national scheme.(v) The Government propose, however, to provide that a workman who,if he came under the new Scheme, would be deemed to be virtually unem-ployable as a result of the injury, may apply to the Ministry of social insurance for a personal allowance of 10s. weekly which will be payable irre-spective of the date of the injury. The cost of such allowances would be borne,not by the employer, but by the Industrial Injury Insurance Fund.Alternative Remedies52. (i) The Report recommends (a) in the Chapter headed &quot; The Problem of alternative Remedies &quot; (paras. 25S-264) the setting up of a Committee toconsider the relation, both in industrial and non-industrial cases, betweenclaims to security benefit and claims for damages in respect of personal injurycaused by negligence, and (b) in paragraph 98 (see also paragraph 81) a reviewof the law governing the liability of employers and third parties to pay damagesor compensation to workmen, or their legal representatives and dependants,independently of the provision for them proposed to be made in the new Scheme.(ii) The Government agree that an inquiry under both heads (a) and (6)is desirable and have set up for this purpose a Committee with compre-hcnsive terms of reference under the Chairmanship of Sir Walter Monckton,K.C.V.O., K.C.
V-SUMMARY OF MAIN FEATURES  OF THE GOVERNMENTSCHEME53- (&apos;) Workmen&apos;s compensation will be treated in future not as part of thelaw of employees liability but as a social service. As, however, the new Schemedeparts from the general scheme of social insurance as regards rates of benefit and is, in many respects, assimilated to the war pensions schemes, it will notbe unified with the general scheme but will be a separate scheme. (Paragraph^24 and 32.)(ii) The Scheme will be comprehensive in scope, i.e. it will cover, broadly speaking, all persons working under a contract of service or apprenticeship,except those under school leaving age. It will not provide for &quot; contracting out &quot; schemes. It will apply to accidents arising out of and in the course ofemployment, and to specified industrial diseases.   (Paragraph 33.)(iii) The liability, instead of being on the individual employer, will be placed upon a Central Fund out of which all benefits, both in disablement and fatalcases, and administrative charges, will be paid.   (Paragraph 34.)(iv) The Fund will be maintained by weekly contributions from employersand workmen collected by stamp, witli a contribution from the Exchequer. the weekly rates of contribution will be 6d. for adult men and 4d. for women, tobe shared equally between the employer and workman. The rates for juvenileswill be half these rates (Paragraph 47). Benefits will not depend on a contri-bution qualification.   (Paragraph 34.)(v) The Scheme will be under the general charge of the Minister of social insurance, but provision will be made for the collaboration of industry inthe development and administration of the Scheme in two ways. First, an advisory Committee or Council will be set up on which employers and workmen will be equally represented, to advise the Minister on important matters of policy and administration referred to them. Secondly, employersand workmen will be equallv represented on the local Appeal Tribunals.(Paragraphs 35 and 36.)(vi) The present procedure by which the workman claims against his em-plover, subject to appeals to Courts of Law, will be superseded by a system under which claims will be dealt with by a Pensions Officer subject to rightsof appeal to local tribunals, and further rights of appeal to an Industrial InjuryInsurance Commissioner whose decision will be final.   (Paragraph 36.)(vii) In disablement cases, benefits will be at uniform flat rates. They will consist of an industrial injury allowance payable for an initial period while the workman is incapacitated for work, to be replaced, in cases where the disable-ment is likely to be permanent or prolonged, by an industral pension, which willbe supplemented b\* a special allowance if the pensioner is unemployable.Allowances will be given for family responsibilities. Treatment allowances and allowances for constant attendance will be provided in certain circumstances.(Paragraphs 37 to 45.)(viii) The industrial pension will not be based on loss of earnings, but on the degree of disablement due to the injury. The degree of disablement will be assessed by a medical board, subject to certain rights of appeal to a specialtribunal, on a comparison of the condition of the workman resulting from the injury with the condition of a normal healthy person of the same age and sex.The pension will be unaffected by subsequent earnings. No provision will bemade for commutation of the pension by a lump sum payment. (Paragraphs29, 36, and 39.)
(ix) Whore the injury results in only a minor degree of disability, provision will be made for a final settlement by an award of a gratuity, or of a temporary allowance at a special rate with or without a final gratuity.   (Paragraph 45.)(x) In fatal cases, provision will be made for payment of a pension to the widow with an allowance for the first child. Where the first child is an orphan,a higher rate of allowance will be payable. In addition, provision will be madein certain circumstances for payment of a pension to one or both parents, ofwhere no widow or parents pension is payable, the payment of a pension tojne adult dependent member of the deceased vvorkman&apos;s family. provision will be made for payment of temporary pension or benefit in certain othereases.
