THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  September 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 518.14*A September, 1944.WAR CABINET.PROGRAMME REDUCTION PROCEDURE.Note by the Lord President of the Council.MY colleagues will, I think, find it useful to see the attached note, preparedby the Ministry of Production in consultation with the other Departmentsconcerned, setting out the current procedure for handling major reductions inthe programmes of munitions production.1. The current procedure for handling major reductions in the programmes of munitions production operates as follows : (a) When the Supply Department receives notification of a substantial reduction in requirements from the corresponding Service Depart-ment, it first of all determines lower rates of total production, andthen proceeds to form its own conclusions as to the best way of distributing the reduced programmes between the individual factories and contractors concerned.(b) In doing so the Supply Department has been guided by its generalknowledge of the labour situation in different areas, as well as by itsown considerations of efficiency or by the need to free particularcapacity to undertake other war production.Additional guidance is being given to enable the Supply Depart-ment to take account, in the changing situation, of 1(i) The need to facilitate the reconversion of particular industries and firms to civil production,(ii) The particular needs of the Development Areas.(c) Having formed its own conclusions, the Supply Department circulatesto the Ministries of Production and Labour and the Board of trade  statement setting out its proposals and calling a meeting at which decisions are reached after these Departments have represented any modifications they wish to suggest, whether as to timing or choice of factories.(d) The meeting agrees to a date on which letters will be posted to firmsaffected, informing them of the decisions, and of the date at whichthey are to take effect. Normally this date is some weeks ahead and gives time for local plans to be made, although some labour may be released immediately.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,14th September, 1944.ANNEX.Major Munitions Items.[28218]
(e) Two clays before the notification is sent out the result of the meeting isnotified to the Regional representatives of the Ministries ofProduction and Labour and the Department concerned.(/) Regional consultation then takes place under a well-established procedure as to the best way to handle local repercussions, both as regardsselection of the labour to be freed and the reabsorption of premises,plant and labour, and by way of explanations to the workpeople.2. The Headquarters of the Employers&apos; Association and Trade unions concerned are informed of the decisions simultaneously with the firms in caseswhere a substantial block of workpeople is to be released. Area branches of bothorganisations are similarly informed Reyionallv.3. The extent to which the above procedure can include information aboutthe effect of programme cuts on sub-contractors is somewhat limited, but supply departments are endeavouring to remedy this in future in cases where the revised programme will involve substantial releases of workpeople.4. The procedure dealt with above constitutes the first stage of the problem.The decisions reached ensure that premises, plant and labour are so far as possiblereleased in the firms and towns where re-absorption on urgent work (war or civilian production) will yield the best results. But they cannot ensure that thereis a precise balance between numbers of workpeople released and numbers whichcan be immediately absorbed on the most urgent production. Thus the second stage of the problem is the detailed process of putting the released labour into theright jobs.This latter process, which is dealt with Regionally, is one mainly for theMinistry of Labour, guided by designation and first preferences determinedat Headquarters, and second preferences determined Regionally. (Designationis controlled by the Ministry of Production and the Ministry of Labour. the preferences Committees are representative of the claimant Departments, and are under the Chairmanship of the Ministry of Labour.)5. It is to be expected in Stage 2 that programme cuts will affect differentdistricts in different ways. In many, a continuance of labour stringency isprobable, while in all, there will be a continued shortage of certain types of labour.To cater for this it is proposed to make increasing provision as necessary in preference lists for the priority requirements of the Board of Trade and otherDepartments.6. In some districts, more labour will become available than preferencevacancies can absorb, and certain measures are under consideration to dispose ofthese surpluses to the best advantage, as follows : (a) Arrangements (probably at the Regional level) to identify other labourabsorption possibilities on important work, including that covered bythe Ministries of Food. Agriculture, Health, &amp;c.(&amp;) Arrangements for advising the Headquarters of the Board of Trade andother Departments concerned with industry of opportunities knownRegionally for absorbing surplus labour, e.g., on civilian productionoutside the priority list.Raw Materials Production.7. Important reductions in the requirements of raw materials for munitionsare dealt with by means of a procedure substantially similar to that described above.Other Munitions Items.8. The procedure described above applies to main munitions stores for whichthe Service requirements are stated for fixed periods of some length (usually12 months), and for which the Supply Departments endeavour to maintain levelrates of total production.Thus the procedure does not apply to :  (a) the very large number of ancillary stores for which contracts are &quot;placed to cover demands as they arise. There is no standard provision fornotification or consultation when the volume of such contracts is reduced, but principles have been agreed for the guidance of supply departments when deciding where to make the reductions.
(b) Non-munitions stores. Production programmes for major items of clothing are adjusted by the Supply Department in consultation withthe Board of Trade and Ministry of Labour. Less important non-munitions stores are dealt with similarly to ancillary stores.General.9. The procedure described above deals with the day-to-day handling of major programme adjustments.If need arises for the discussion of general issues of principle, this can bedealt with by the Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee which dealswith industrial problems and comprises the Minister of Reconstruction, Ministerof Labour, Minister of Production, President of the Board of Trade; the threeSupply Ministers and other Ministers attending when matters affecting their departments are under discussion.
