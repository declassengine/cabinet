THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 538.22nd September, 1944.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1944 FOR THEDOMINIONS. INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.IN spite of some setbacks to the Liberal Party, the Prime Minister,Mr. Mackenzie King, retains his personal reputation. The 25th anniversary ofhis leadership of the Liberal Party has been made the occasion for specialacknowledgment of his unique position in Canadian public life, drawing remark-able tributes in the House from the leaders of other parties and generous reports in the press throughout Canada, irrespective of the political colour of the newspaper.2. While the Government have had little substantial opposition from insideParliament, they have met heavy criticism from Colonel Drew, the ProgressiveConservative Premier of Ontario, who has attacked the Family Allowances Billon the ground that &quot;it is an arrogant usurpation of provincial powers.&quot; two points about his attitude are significant, for his denunciation has been described as the opening cry in a &quot; coming battle &quot; between the rest of Canada andQuebec, while, on the other hand, his stand for provincial rights against theFederal invasion of power is in principle the same standpoint as that adopted bythe autonomists in Quebec.3. The result of the Quebec election on the 8th August was as follows :Union Nationale 48, Liberals 37, Bloc Populaire 4, Nationale 1, C.C.F. 1. Thefinal tabulation of votes cast shows the following interesting results : Liberal517,000, Union Nationale 484,000, Bloc Populaire 189,000, C.C.F. 35,000. thus the total Liberal poll was higher than that of the Union Nationale; theyobtained 40 per cent, of the seats with 41 per cent, of the votes cast, whereas the Union Nationale secured more than 50 per cent, of the seats with only 36 percent, of the votes. The main reason for this result is to be found in the largenumber of parties contesting so many of the seats, and to the fact that the liberals on the whole won the populous urban districts with large majorities,whereas the Union Nationale scraped through with a number of small victoriesin rural areas. The Liberal Administration was due to resign on the 31st August,when the Administration passed into the hands of Mr. Duplessis of the UnionNationale. The election can undoubtedly be interpreted as a rebuff to the federal government and to the National Liberal Party. Mr. Duplessis has made themaintenance of provincial rights the main plank in his platform and seized theopportunity of the general unpopularity of Federal war-time control. Thecrushing defeat of the ultra-nationalist Bloc Populaire, whose hopes had been so high, seems an indication that the voters have condemned the racial bitternessof the extremists. A sequel to the Quebec election was the release of M. Houde,the former Mayor of Montreal, who was interned in 1940 for urging that call-upnotices should be disregarded; he received a great ovation on his entry intoMontreal.
4. The election results in Alberta were : Social Credit 51, C.C.F. 2, Veterans&apos;Party 1, Independents 3. While other provinces have recently voted for achange, this demonstration of continued loyalty to Social Credit seems remark-able. Mr. Manning, the Premier, is. however, regarded as a very ableadministrator. Particularly significant was the complete failure of the C.C.F.in contrast to their recent victory in the neighbouring province of Saskatchewan.5. 135 candidates were nominated for the jews Brunswick ProvincialElection, the result of which was Liberals 36, Progressive Conservatives 12,C.C.F. nil. Thus the Liberal Government has been confirmed in power by a substantially increased majority and jews Brunswick is the only province to haveendorsed the Liberal Party in recent elections.6.   Explaining Canada&apos;s attitude to the Pan-American Union, the PrimeMinister, after referring to the increasing co-operation between Canada and theother nations of the Western Hemisphere, pointed out that Canada had received .no formal invitation to join the Lhiion and suggested that it was not unreasonablefor Canada to defer consideration of the matter until after the war.7. The Minister of Trade and Commerce has introduced legislation designedto facilitate Canadian export trade. The Bill which has been passed provides forthe setting-up of an Export Credits Insurance Corporation for the giving of guarantees by the Dominion Government to encourage exports from Canada.8. By an exchange of notes the Governments of Canada and the UnitedStates have agreed that the cost of all airfields and facilities of a permanentnature established by the United States in Canada during the War will be reimbursed, these works being relinquished to Canada.9. Mr. Henry Laureys, formerly Canadian High Commissioner to SouthAfrica, has been appointed first Ambassador to Peru.10. Mr. L. B. Pearson, formerly Minister Counsellor at Washington, hasbeen raised to the rank of Minister Plenipotentiary.Service Activities.11. On the night of the 5th/6th H.M.C. Destroyers Haida and Iroquois, in company with H.M. Cruiser Bellonaand H.M. Destroyers Tartar and Ashanti,intercepted a heavily escorted south-bound convoy off St. Xazaire. Six enemy ships were probably sunk, the remaining ship may have escaped. A second convoymaking for St. Xhzaire was also engaged and some enemy ships damaged.H.M.C.S. Haida received slight damage and had two killed. On the 8thH.M.C. Corvette Regina, while escorting a convoy, was sunk, probably by U-boat,off North Cornwall; six officers and about seventy ratings were rescued. On thesame day H.M.C. Destroyer St. Laurent was slightly damaged by a near-missfrom a glider bomb west of Lorient. On the 10th H.M.C. Destroyers Algonquinand Sioux formed part of the escort to a carrier-borne aircraft attack on theNorwegian coast. On the 12th the Canadian Escort Group, consisting of H.M.C.Destroyers Assiniboine, QiC Appelle, Restigouche and Skeena intercepted three enemy trawders south of Brest; two of them were set on fire and driven ashoreand one was damaged. On the 15th H.M.C.S. Iroquois, wdth H.M.S. Mauritiusand Ursa, fought three actions off La Rochelle. In the first attack four ships were intercepted, of which one was left sinking, one on fire and a tanker was damaged and driven ashore. Further north, one small tanker, two cargo ships and two minesweepers were driven ashore, four of these ships being damaged andon fire. On the 21st H.M.C. Corvette Alberni was sunk by an under-waterexplosion south-east of the Isle of Wight; three officers and twenty-eight ratingswere saved. HALO Frigate Stormont, while picking up survivors from an aircraft off the mouth of the Gironde. was heavily shelled by shore batteries and sustained one killed and one wounded. H.M.C.S. Algonquin and Sioux wereamong the escorts&apos;to Florae Fleet Carriers in an air attack against the Tirpitz.On the night of the 22nd/23rd H.M.C.S. Iroquois, with H.M.S. Mauritius andUrsa patrolling west of Belle He, drove ashore a minesweeper and an A.A. ship and sank a small cargo ship. Later, west of Lorient, they sank two merchant ships, two A.A. ships and a minesweeper.12. The successful offensive by the First United States Army, launched southand west of St. Lo on the 25th July, had, by the first days of August, achieved a major break-through.   This success was largely due to heavy and continuous
fighting by the British and Canadian Armies, against an enemy obliged tostrengthen and stabilise his right flank at all costs when threatened with a majorwithdrawal of his left flank.13. On the night of the 7th/8th, after a very heavy air bombardment, anattack was launched by the First Canadian Army astride the Caen-Falaise road.In very heavy fighting good progress was made to a depth of about 6 miles andBretteville sur Laize was captured. After this, progress was for some days slow,but the Canadian Army, although making no sensational advances, was, neverthe-less, admirably fulfilling its task by maintaining relentless pressure on the enemy and pinning down his troops. On the 11th the German salient, between the canadians and the United Kingdom bridgehead across the Orne, was finallyeliminated in face of bitter opposition. This relieved the general situation on that part of the front, and on the loth the Canadians, who since the 10th had been held up astride the Caen-Falaise road by a strong anti-tank screen and heavilydefended positions, opened a new attack east of the road after another very heavyair bombardment. This attack made ground and on the following day the leadingCcinadian elements were fighting in Falaise.14. On the 17th the Canadians captured Falaise, which to the last wasbitterly contested and a day later Polish and French armour made the first contactacross the gap south of Trim. On the 20th this Falaise-Argentan gap Avas finallyclosed. The surrounded Germans made desperate efforts to free themselves incontinuous furious fighting, chiefly in the Chambois area, lasting until the 22nd.15. All was now clear for a rapid advance on a broad front towards theSeine. On the 25th contact was established with the United States forces nearElbeuf, and during the following night two newr crossings were secured by united Kingdom troops at Vernon and Canadians at Point de 1&apos;Arche some10 miles south of Rouen. During the next few days United Kingdom and canadian troops crossed further up the Seine. At the mouth of the river fighting was especially fierce as the enemy engaged in desperate rearguard actions toprotect the crossing places. By the 30th, however, the great loops of the riverinto which the enemy had been pushed had been cleared and resistance south ofthe river had ceased.16. Heavy bombers of No. 6 R.C.A.F. Bomber Group established a newBomber Command record for the month of August with a total of 3.700 sorties.Over 17,000 operational hours were flown and a total of more than 13,000 tonsof bombs were dropped on enemy territory. These figures compare with 2,592sorties totalling 12,347 operational hours in July. During the month, in aircombat five enemy aircraft were destroyed, one was probably destroyed and threewere damaged. Nineteen bombers are missing from these operations. The maintargets are flying-bomb bases, marshalling yards, factories, road and rail communications and tactical targets in support of the Allied Armies on theContinent.17. Beaufighters, Wellingtons and Sunderlands of R.C.A.F. coastal command Squadrons flew 321 sorties totalling 3,128 operational hours. three aircraft are missing from these operations. One U-boat was sighted, but anattack was not possible. One 8,000-ton merchant ship was sunk and anothermerchant ship was left burning. A 2,000-ton depot ship and nine escort vessels were damaged, six smaller craft were hit&quot;by R.P. and left in flames.18. No. 402 Spitfire Squadron and No. 418 Mosquito Night IntruderSquadron, in the Air Defence of Great Britain, flew 833 sorties totalling 1,440operational hours. No aircraft are missing from these operations. Two enemy aircraft were destroyed and three more damaged. Twenty-four flying-bombs were shot down during the period. Nos. 406, 409 and 410 R.C.A.F. Squadronsformerly in the Air Defence of Great Britain, have now been transferred to the2nd Tactical Air Force.19. R.C.A.F. Squadrons in the 2nd Tactical Air Force, of which there arenow 18, flew 9,403 sorties totalling 11,857 operational hours. Thirty-two aircraft are missing from these operations. During the month of August these Squadronsdestroyed 37 enemy aircraft and damaged 14., 20 No. 413 R.C.A.F. Catalina Squadron of Air Command. South-EiastAsia located in Ceylon, flew 65 sorties totalling 812 operational hours. Noincidents occurred during these operations and all Squadron aircraft returnedsa Pely to base.[28272] B 2
21. - No. 417 R.C.A.F. Fighter Squadron located in Italy flew 315 sortiestotalling 405 operational hours during the first two weeks of August in directsupport of the Allied Armies in this theatre of operations. One aircraft is missing from these operations.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.22. His Majesty The King has approved the conferment of an Earldomon Lord Cowrie on his relinquishing the appointment of Governor-General ofthe Commonwealth of Australia. Tributes to Lord Gowrie have been paid byall sections of Australian opinion.23. The defeat of the Referendum for the transfer of special powers to theCommonwealth Government for post-war reconstruction was not unexpected.Without the Service votes., it was defeated by 183,459 votes, the actual figuresbeing 1.367,106 for and 1.550.565 against, and it is not expected that the Servicevotes will affect the general outcome. In any case, in addition to an absolutemajority of votes, it was necessary for four out of the six States to show amajority, but preliminary returns show a majority against in New South Wales,Queensland and Tasmania. South Australia and Western Australia show amajority in votes for the Referendum. Commenting on the results of the referendum, the Prime Minister, Mr. Curtin, said he was disappointed but notsurprised by the result. He said that the Government would consider any proposals for consitutional amendment put forward by those who opposed thetransfer of powers to the Commonwealth. The Opposition Leader, Mr. Menzies,who led the campaign against the Referendum, said the Opposition believedthe revision of the Constitution should be considered by a Convention to meetas soon as possible after the war.24. The United Kingdom and Canadian Branches of the Empire Parlia-mentary Association met a warm reception in Australia. Colonel Wickham, the leader of the United Kingdom Delegation, released Mr. Collindridge for consultation with the Commonwealth authorities on the coal situation inAustralia, and he has, in fact, spoken to the miners and made several broadcastsDr. Edith Summerskiirs visits to hospitals and her examination of the health and Social Services were welcomed. The visit of the Delegation has done muchto bring home to the Australian people the magnitude of the United Kingdomwar effort.25. The coal situation had greatly deteriorated during the last month, andit has now become necessary to ration supplies to industries, a step which it isfeared will lead to unemployment.26. Important decisions on post-war works and developmental projects areexpected at the Premiers&apos; Conference, which began on the 24th August, when a 200 million programme was to be discussed. Subjects to be examined aresoldiers&apos; settlement, housing and national works. A plan for the settlement ofBritish and Australian servicemen together on areas of land has been developedby the Wine Associations of Australia for the expansion of the wine industry.27. A statement issued on behalf of the Prime Minister, Mr. Curtin, whohas been ill with influenza, outlines plans for the establishment of an employment service to be established throughout Australia, a service which will place beforethose seeking work a full range of possibilities and will offer employers access to the labour supplies of the whole country.-28. The Director-General of Munitions and Aircraft Production,Mr. Essington Lewis, is about to visit the United Kingdom and the United States,and there is increasing evidence in Australia that the Government are fullyalive to the increasing part which civil aviation will play in Australia^ future.Service Activities.29. One H.M.A. Destroyer and two H.M.A. Frigates are fitting out afterlaunching.30. A total of 20,387 personnel have now been discharged from the Armyin accordance with the Government^ plan to release Army personnel to ruralindustry.
31. Total strength of United States forces (Army and Air Corps) in theSouth-West Pacific area on the 8th August was 667,424 including 136,562 ofthe Air Corps.32. Major-General R. K. Dewing, C.B., D.S.O., M.C., who was Head ofthe United Kingdom Army Staff Mission in Australia, left Australia on the21st August on return to the United Kingdom.Economic.33. The Ministry of Food have concluded a three-year contract with australia for eggs (shell or dried) extending to the 1946 production season. Forthe first two years, no minimum or maximum quantities have been specified, butfor the third year a maximum quantity of 1 million cases of shell, or equivalent in dried, has been fixed. The Ministry have the option to take eggs in shellin accordance with shipping facilities available.34. On the 15th August the International Sugar Council passed a resolutionrecommending to the Governments represented on the Council the signature of a Protocol providing for the prolongation for one year from the 31st August,1944, of the International Agreement for the Regulation of the Production and marketing of Sugar, signed in London on the 6th May, 1937. The Protocolwas opened for signature by the Governments which are parties to the Agree-ment on the 31st August, and will remain open until the 30th September. TheGovernments of the Commonwealth of Australia and the Union of South Africahave authorised their respective High Commissioners in London to sign the protocol.NEW ZEALAND.35. The visit of the United Kingdom and Canadian Branches of theEmpire Parliamentary Association to New Zealand has been very successful andeverywhere the Delegations received a great welcome.36. The Minister for Finance presented his Budget which was as expected,and taxation remains unchanged. The financial position remains very muchas last year, except that the peak in war expenditure has now been passed.37. A debate took place in the House of Representatives attacking theGovernment for suppressing freedom of speech by means of the press censorship.38. The campaign for the Fourth Victory Loan of  40 million started oathe 28th August and was given extensive publicity.39. The Hon. Kenneth Stuart Patton has been appointed United StatesMinister to New Zealand.*Service A activities.40. H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles has left the United Kingdom under Admiraltyoperational control for service with the Eastern Fleet.41. On the night of the 1st/2nd New Zealanders attacked the high groundsouth of Florence and made some progress on their left, but were held up ontheir right; the strong German resistance which they encountered continued onthe 3rd, but on the 4th they succeeded in entering the southern outskirts ofFlorence. Later on, on the 11th, they advanced about one and a half miles inthe area and west of Empoli and south of the Arno and cleared up a smallcentre of German resistance.42. After completing conferences in London the Chief of the Air Staffreturned to New Zealand, via Washington, during the month. As a result of theLondon conferences and others held with Service Chiefs in Washington, thefuture role of the R.N.Z.A.F. units in the Pacific was decided upon.43. In future, certain combat squadrons of the R.N.Z.A.F. will be underthe operational control of Commander, South-West Pacific Area. This may eventually render it necessary to change over from United States Navy types of aircraft to United States Army Air Force types.
Economic.44. Agreement has been reached between the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and New Zealand for the sale to the United Kingdom of the totalexportable surplus of New Zealand butter, cheese, beef, veal, mutton and lambfor the next four years. In addition, the United Kingdom will purchase the exportable surplus &quot;of pig meat up to the end of June 1946. and thereafter suchquantities as may be agreed.45. The prices have been agreed for the first two years. Prices, as well as other provisions of the agreement, are subject to review in respect of the third and fourth years on the grounds of substantial changes in conditions.46. In connexion with these negotiations, the New Zealand Governmentreverted to a question which they had previously raised on several occasions,namely, the large increase over pre-war levels of the prices of United kingdom exports to New Zealand as compared with the much smaller increase in prices ofNew Zealand exports to the United Kingdom. The New Zealand government wished, in order to maintain their price stabilisation policy and to avoidinflation, to maintain their existing export price levels and, therefore, asked theUnited Kingdom Government to consider making a payment to New Zealandas compensation for the disparity in the &quot;terms of trade &quot; over the years 1940-43,with corresponding current payments; they calculated that over the four years in question the additional value of New Zealand exports, on the basis of themovement in United Kingdom indices, was in the neighbourhood of   N.Z. 104million.47. The United Kingdom authorities felt bound to maintain the attitude which they had adopted from the first, namely, that they could not accept theprinciple that there was any obligation upon them to maintain parity betweenthe price level of their exports and imports; the idea appeared to them unsoundin economic theory while in practice it would put the United Kingdom in ahopelessly difficult position vis-a-vis the many other countries with which theytrade. On the other hand, it was recognised (1) that New Zealand prices were on the low side and that some additional payment on this account would bejustified if based on the true cost of her exports to the United Kingdom(including such items as fertiliser and agricultural wage cost subsidies), and (2)that, in view of New Zealand&apos;s exceptional dependence on agricultural productionand export, some contribution towards general stabilisation subsidies would be reasonable.48. After prolonged discussions and correspondence, first with Mr. Nashin February and later with Mr. Eraser during his visit in the summer, agreement was reached on the following basis, which was regarded as complementary, on thefinancial side, to the conclusion of the long-term meat and dairy producecontracts (a) the increased prices agreed with the Ministry of Food under the contracts for New Zealand meat and dairy produce were based onproducers&apos; costs and on subsidies directly paid to producers;(b) as a contribution towards general stabilisation, as distinct from direct.subsidies, the United Kingdom would pay  4 million a year for fouryears;(c) since, partly as a result of her stabilisation of export prices at a relatively low level. New Zealand will be faced with serious problems in reconstructing her productive capacity in our interests as consumersas well as in her own as producers, and in order to strengthen further the New Zealand Governments sterling position in the light ofprospective debt maturities (this to be regarded as an interim settle-ment and not as a final settlement of reciprocal claims which the twoGovernments might have as a result of the financial partnership ofthe British Commonwealth during the war), the United KingdomGovernment (1) would credit the New Zealand Government with a cash payment of  12 million, (2) would agree that an amountof  18 million of New Zealand&apos;s indebtedness under the Memorandumof Security should be carried forward for subsequent adjustment ata time and on terms convenient to the New Zealand Government.
UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.49. Discussions on Field-Marshal Smuts&apos;s successor have now been broughtinto the open by the statement in Dr. Steyn&apos;s Free State newspaper Die Volkthat he does not personally aspire to the Prime Ministership and recognisesMr. Hofmeyr as the unchallenged heir and successor. It will be rememberedthat Dr. Steyn suffered a decline in prestige as the result of his granting areprieve for Gunner Smith (previously reported). The statement in Die Volkhas been warmly welcomed in the pro-Government press, and it is thought thatthe association between the two should prove very successful. Suiderstemthe paper of Mr. Conroy, Minister of Lands and Cape leader of the united party, also welcomes the statement. It was well known that Mr. Conroy himself had similar aspirations, and it appears, therefore, that the United Party, in face of Opposition activity and difficult prospects ahead, is already trying to consolidate its forces.50. The attack on the Nationalist M.P., Mr. F. H. Mentz, has revived thefeud between the Nationalists and the Ossewa Brandwag, who are regarded as responsible for the attack. Their leader, Mr. Van Rensburg, has hinted thatthe Ossewa Brandwag will proceed to the formation of a &quot; political front &quot; and put up candidates at elections in opposition to Nationalists.51. Dr. Malan is making a series of speeches in various parts of the Cape,and is expected soon to visit the three northern Provinces. He has declared thatthe day is now not far away when South Africa will be ruled by a Nationalist PartyGovernment and that the Party stands not for one race only but for a principle and a policy which could be applied to the whole of South Africa. He denied thecharge that the Party was isolationist, but asserted that it would not allow SouthAfrica to be shut up in a British kraal or involved in British wars. Dr. Malanhas made a bitter attack on the Ossewa Brandwag for its disruptive activities and its Nazi ideology.52. Considerable importance is attached to the Provincial council by-election at Germiston in September, and the Nationalists regard the contesras a trial of strength on the Rand and are making every effort to capture the seat from the United Party.53. Much attention still centres round the discussions against the Pretoriacompromise on Indian penetration. When Field-Marshal Smuts visited Durban,he held a number of private meetings with representative bodies and emphasised the gravity of the issue from the standpoint of South Africa&apos;s relations withthe Empire and India. Durban City Council and commercial and industrial interests, in a memorandum presented to the Prime Minister, maintain that thepurchase of property is being conducted by some Indian speculators with the help of Johannesburg building societies. They press for complete separation of europeans and Indians in regard to both occupation and purchase. One of themost recent developments has been that the Natal Indian Congress denies thatit has ever given its consent to the principle of residential segregation or thatit was embodied even by implication in the Pretoria Agreement. By doing this,it has played into the hands of the European extremists, who are opposed to this measure and whose numbers are increasing. It appears very unlikely that thedraft Ordinance will ever be successful, and the most which can be hoped for is a working compromise.54. The European mine-workers&apos; demand for 30 per cent, increase in wageshas again come to the forefront as a result of the appointment of an arbitrationpanel of three, a demand met reluctantly by the Government. The Mine-workers&apos;Union have now taken a violent dislike to one of the arbitrators and demandhis elimination. The Secretary of the Union has also expressed his dislike ofMi-. Hofmeyr. The situation seems likely to become serious, and it is known thatthe Government is remembering the situation in 1922, when the miners&apos; strike on the Rand led to a labour pact with the Nationalists and the fall ofGeneral Smuts from power.Economic.55. In August 1943 representations were made to the Union Governmentwith a view to increasing the quantity of shipment coal available for export
from South Africa. Up to that date the monthly output had been of the orderof 150.000-200,000 short tons a month.56. As a result of the measures taken by the Union authorities output was stepped up to 400,000 short tons a month by the beginning of the year.Exports dropped from April onwards owing to the seasonal demands on therailways of the maize and sugar cane traffic and to increased winter demands for coal; in June they fell to 350,000 tons. Nevertheless, output averaged417.000 tons a month over the first half of 1944.57. A target of 450,000 tons a month has now been fixed and programmes of the transportation material (particularly locomotives and mining machinery)required to enable the Union to reach this figure have been furnished to theappropriate United States and United Kingdom supply authorities.58. It is estimated that output for September, October and November willrecover to 400.000 short tons a month and that thereafter it will increase furtherup to the target figure of 450.000 tons provided deliveries of the new locomotivesare maintained to schedule.EIRE.59. The new Senate held its first meeting on the 18th August. Of its sixtymembers, eleven were nominated by Mr. de Valera. The system of election to the senate has caused some controversy in Eire.60. The Vocational Commission, appointed in 1939, under the chairman-ship of the Bishop of Galway. to examine the possibility of constituting a second chamber on a vocational basis, has now reported. The report rejects the sugges-tion that functional or vocational bodies should be employed as agencies for the recruitment of a legislative chamber. Its principal recommendation is that aNational Vocational Assembly representing all the principal occupational groups in Eire should be formed to advise the Government on the best means of imple-menting national policy and to function alongside, and parallel with, the existingpolitical administration. Leaving untouched the political structure, the reportseems to favour a continuance of the present quasi-vocational basis of Senatemembership.61. On the occasion of the 27th anniversary of his first election in Claire,Mr. de Valera reviewed the objectives of the national struggle and the progress made in the last thirty years. Mr. de Valera said that they had a very simpleobjective and a very simple philosophy; they had been governed by an outsidepeople, in the interests, naturally, of that rjeople, and their first aim had been toget rid of government from outside and secure government by the Irish people themselves. That had been fully secured for twenty-six of the thirty-twocounties, but what was wanted was not freedom for a portion but for the whole oftheir country, and the task of securing freedom for the six counties remains.Mr. de Valera went on to say that they wanted freedom in order to do the thingsthey thought it right to do, and one of those things was the restoration of theIrish language. If the language disappeared, he said, one of the things forwhich they had fought for 750 years would be lost. An obvious plan was first tokeep the language alive in the Gaeltacht and to make a special effort to bring it back to the Breac-Gaeltaeht. The foundation of the plan must be the teaching of the language in the schools and the use of it by the younger people.62. Mr. cle Valera on other occasions urged the revival of Gaelic, and a newtest for making Irish the sole language for Eire civil servants has been insti-tuted, forming, it is said, part of plans for the complete &quot; Gaelicising &quot; of theCivil Service.63. An order has been made under the Eire Emergency Powers Actsrequiring lure residents who owe debts to persons in Germany to pay such debtsto the Minister of Finance. The order is stated to have been made by arrange-ment with the German Government. The money collected by the Eire Govern-ment will be used to meet the liabilities of the German Government to the eire government for damage caused by German bombs and other matters. TheGerman Legation in Dublin had previously made efforts to collect the debts them-selves, but had failed in a test case in the Eire courts.
INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political.64. The projected meeting between Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Jinnah was themain topic of political discussion and comment at the beginning of August, buttension relaxed with the news of the postponement of the meeting in consequenceof Mr. Jinnah&apos;s illness. It was reported at the end of the month that the twoleaders had arranged to hold their postponed meeting on the 9th September.The danger that Mr. Gandhi might commit himself in some degree or other to aceptance of the Pakistan principle of the division of India between Hindus andMoslems continued to attract criticism and protest from Hindu quarters.Moslems, on the other hand, profess full confidence in Mr. Jinnah. In the middleof August there was published the Viceroy&apos;s reply to Mr. Gandhi&apos;s letter of the27th July; the Viceroy defined the stand taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government onthe terms and conditions offered by Sir Stafford Cripps in 1942, and made it plain that proposals such as those sketched in Gandhi&apos;s letter of the 27th July were quite unacceptable to His Majesty Government as a basis for discussion. Inother respects the month passed without any political development of note.65. Mention may be made of the satisfaction felt by Moslem opinion inIndia at the gratifying announcement that arrangements would be made this autumn for the resumption of an annual pilgrimage to Mecca though of necessityon a limited scale. The arrangements had to be abandoned last year owing to therisk of enemy action; their resumption and the ability of the Admiralty to provideescorts for the pilgrim ships are welcomed as signs of the improved war situation.Foreign and Frontier Relations.66. A afghanistan. The annual independence celebrations were held at theend of July and passed off without incident. The situation in the southern province remained unchanged. Mazrak, the tribal leader, had an interview withthe British Political Agent in Waziristan on the 7th August, at Datta Khel, and showed some inclination to settle in India on terms suggested by the Governmentof India.67. The Afghan Government put in a formal request for permission for anAfghan military mission to visit India, for the purpose of inspecting British and american equipment and armaments and studying their service training methods.This request is significant as showing that the Afghan Government realise theirdependence upon us and the United States for the improvement and equipment oftheir Army after the war, and if the mission, which it is proposed tc accept, issuccessful, it should have a considerable effect in cementing Anglo-Afghanrelations.i68. North-West Frontier. The Frontier, including Waziristan, was quietthough some restlessness on the part of the Mahsuds was reported on account ofthe food shortage.69. Tibet. Mr. Shen, the new Chinese Representative, arrived in Llassa onthe 8th August. He was received by representatives of the Tibetan Governmentand with a guard of honour. The Chinese at Llassa had made considerablepreparations. He created a fair first impression though he is believed to haveprotested at a member of the Tibetan Foreign Office (which the Chinese refuseto recognise) being deputed to met him.70. Sir Basil Gould, Political Officer in Sikkim, who is being sent on aspecial visit to Llassa, was due to arrive at the end of the month&quot;. He has been instructed to give the Tibetans any necessary support in the maintenance ofthe Tibetan position against Chinese influence, but, at the same time, to makeit clear to both Mr. Shen and the Tibetans that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould welcome an agreed solution whereby the Tibetans would recogniseChinese suzerainty in return for the recognition by China of Tibetan autonomyand a satisfactory boundary settlement. He is also to discuss with the TibetanGovernment the steps being taken by the Government of India to establish their position up to the MacMahon Line.&quot;71.   Sinkiang. His Majesty&apos;s Consul at Urumchi reported a series of massarrests, chiefly of educationalists and students in Urumchi said to be connected[28272] , c
with a plot against the State. The situation in the town was reported to bequiet with an undercurrent of uneasiness, but there were no immediate reper-cussions in Kashgar.72. Nepal. An informal suggestion was received by His Majesty&apos;minister from the Maharaja for a visit to India for sightseeing by the king of Nepal and the Heir Apparent. They would travel incognito and be accompanied by General Bahadur, the Maharaja&apos;s son. This would be thefirst occasion on which a king of Nepal had crossed the frontier since relationswere established with the Kingdom of Nepal, and the fact that the HeirApparent would accompany tlie King would throw a serious responsibility onthe Government of India. It would, however, seem difficult to refuse the requestif the King and the Maharaja are anxious for the visit to take place.73. Persian Gulf&apos;.-There were unfortunate incidents both at Sharjah andBahrein arising from the behaviour of the United States service personnel. AtSharjah three Americans attempted to assault and abduct, for immoral purposes,a female relative of the Deputy Ruler of Sharjah (the Sheikh himself beingaway). It was reported that only our good relations with the Sheikh and thelocal people prevented the incident developing in a very ugly fashion. AtBahrein four Americans assaulted three Bahrein policemen, fortunately without serious consequences. These incidents emphasise the necessity for the postingof sufficient American Provost personnel to these stations without delay.74. Public confidence in the Gulf was greatly reinforced by the victory in Normandy, the fall of Paris and the political landslide in Eastern Europe.Economic.75. Transporiation. Some measure of progress has been achieved with theproblem of meeting Indians additional requirements of 318 broad-gauge loco-niotives and 24,000 broad-gauge wagons. The Combined Board TransportationCommittee have approved Canada&apos;s offer of 100 XD locos and 8,000 wagons andfirm orders have already been placed. We have yet to secure American agree-ment, however, to the supply from the United States of the remaining 218 locosand 16,000 wagons. Despite the fact that General Covell had agreed with theCommander-in-chief. India, that 80 per cent, of these locomotives and wagonsshould be regarded as essentially military, the Americans have refused to include any portion of the requirement in the Army Supply programme. This decision was conveyed during General Somervell&apos;s absence in Europe. General Somervellhas now returned to Washington and the British Missions have been instructedto pursue the matter vigorously with him and to press him to accept 174 locosand 12.000 wagons (i.e.. 80 per cent.) on the Army Supply programme for delivery as early as possible in 1945.76. Still further enquiries have been made about the operational efficiency of the Indian railways, and Sir Leonard Wilson, Chief Commissioner of Rail-ways in India, is now in Washington with a view to removing misconceptions onthis point.U.N.R.R.A.77. In view of the Council meeting of U.N.R.R.A. at Montreal inSeptember the following matters relating to U.N.R.R.A. were considered duringthe month of August.78. Scope of U.N.R.R.A. During the debate on U.N.R.R.A. in the IndianLegislature a resolution was passed to the effect that U.N.R.R.A. benefits shouldbe made available to areas important to the military operations of the united nations which are stricken by famine or disease. This was designed to enableLT.N.R.R.A. relief to be extended to India herself. The resolution was very similar to one previously passed by the United States Congress. As a result of negotiations with the United States State Department a draft resolution was prepared by the latter for submission to the Council of U.N.R.R.A. which, if adopted, would enable U.N.R.R.A. benefits to be made available in the circum-stances defined in the Indian Legislature^ resolution provided that U.N.R.R.A.&apos;sfunds and resources were adequate and that due regard was paid to the fact that.N.R.R.A.&apos;s primary function is in respect of liberated territories. In fact, theGovernment of India have no desire for U.N.R.R.A. to operate in India, and thedraft resolution now proposed it intended merely to save the face of the UnitedStates Congress.
79. Membership of Committee of Supplies. The Government of india have been pressing for Indian representation on the Committee of Supplies of u.N.R.R.A. on the ground that India is likely to be the largest supplier of reliefmaterials among Asiatic countries and should therefore be included in theCommittee. It was agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Governments representatives at montreal should support India&apos;s candidature for this Committee, although itmay not be possible to press this support very far if India&apos;s nomination leads toapplications for inclusion from other countries. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Washington, was instructed to inform Dominion representatives in Washingtonof His Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude and to invite them also to back Indianselection. Subject to the promise of support by the Dominions, His Majesty&apos; Ambassador was also instructed to approach the United States Government andthe Soviet and Chinese representatives in Washington in the same sense.80. Far Eastern Committee of U.N.R.R.A . The Government of India were anxious that, if it were decided that the headquarters of the Far EasternCommittee of U.N.R.R.A. should be moved from Washington, an Indian locationshould be chosen until the Committee could move into liberated territory. Thiswas in conflict with His Majesty&apos;s Governments proposal to nominate Sydneyfor the temporary headquarters of the Committee, this place being consideredmore suitable than location at Chungking, which the United States had promisedthe Chinese they weuld support. The Government of India were accordinglyasked to support the location of the Committee at Sydney and this they agreedto do, provided that the Dominions support their election to the Committee ofSupplies.Naval, Military and A ir Force A activities.81.   Royal Indian Navy. Nothing to report.82. Military: Italy. Indian troops were engaged throughout the month inthe operations of the 8th Army around Florence and in the advance to theGothic Line.83. Burma. By the middle of August no organised Japanese forcesremained on Indian soil. On the Tiddim road the Burma frontier was crossedand the 5th Indian Division advanced some 11 miles beyond it to 86 milestonesouth of Imphal. To begin with, opposition was light, but later stiffened. North-east of Tamu the Chindwin river was reached between Homalin and Taungdup.All the main remnants of the enemy forces north of Taungdup were withdrawneast of the river. Our troops also advanced 25 miles south of Tamu. In all areasmuch evidence of Japanese disorganisation in the shape of unburied dead and abandoned wrounded, motor transport and equipment were found. There w-erealso clear indications that the enemy was suffering the effect of lack of food.84. In Arakan only patrolling was carried out. The rainfall in this area was frequently over 2 inches in the 24 hours.85. In Northern Burma British troops operating with General StillwTeH&apos;sChinese forces captured Pinbaw on the railway 26 miles S.W. of Mogaung. Therailway between Mogaung and Myitkyina became a secure L. of C. chinese troops with Kachin Levies captured Kazu 20 miles south of Myitkyina on theMyitkyina-Bhamo road. During the last week in August a general eastwardmove of enemy troops from Katha to Bhamo wras reported.86. Air. In spite of the monsoon weather Eastern Air Command continuedto maintain a high operational effort. Some 8,400 sorties were flown. As monsoonconditions rendered roads difficult and rivers swollen, railways became increasingly important to the Japanese for their main lines of supply.&apos; EasternAir Command, therefore, successfully concentrated their attacks on rail and roadbridges. This forced the enemy to make a greater use of waterways again, whereAllied aircraft proceeded to take a heavy toll of river craft. Japanese airfields and troop bases were also attacked.87. Transport aircraft averaged about 1,000 sorties a week despite the unfavourable weather.88. The 3rd Tactical Air Force was mainly employed in close-supportattacks on Japanese troops on the Tididim and Tamu roads.89.   Our losses of all types of aircraft were about \ per cent.90.   The Japanese Air Force was almost entirely inactive during the month.[28272]   &apos; d
91. General: Oil Projects. American pipelines from Calcutta were brought into operation to Western Bengal, and will shortly be in operation toN.E. Assam.92. Movement and Transportation. Military cargo tonnages discharged atCalcutta and Madras increased by 30 per cent, and 25 per cent, respectively.Severe monsoon conditions at Bombay caused a serious working delay which resulted in vessels having to await&apos;berths for the first time for several months.93. The tonnage of stores carried on the Assam L. of C. has increased by60 per cent, in the last nine months.94. Bombay Port Reconstruction. Good progress continued to be made onthe clearance and reconstruction of the docks. The cutting up and removal ofwreckage and damaged cargo from the bottom of Victoria Dock proceededsatisfactorily. Repairs to quay walls except North Quay were completed.Reconstruction of the latter was delayed by heavy rain. Restoration of existingshedding has been 75 per cent, completed at Princes Dock and 65 per cent, atVictoria Dock.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.Occupied Burma.95. The 1st August was the anniversary of &quot; Burmese Independence Day &quot;and the. Japanese clearly made great efforts to use the occasion for propaganda purposes. Numerous ceremonies took place and congratulations were sent tothe Burmese Government by the Emperor, Premier. Foreign Minister and otherdignitaries in Japan, the Japanese Commander-in-Chief and the japanese ambassador in Burma, the President of the Nanking puppet Government, theEmperor and Premier of Manchukuo, the puppet President of the Philippines,Subhas Chandra Bose, and Hitler. Mussolini and the Premier of Hungary.96. Various reports indicate that all officials are required to take an oathof allegiance to Ba Maw. A recent report states that they did so and openlyridiculed the ceremony after it was held.tTHE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the colonies in the restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies to Ceylon.97. Reference was made in the report for June to Ceylon&apos;s import require-ments of wheat and flour for the remainder of 1944. It has now been arranged with the Ministry of War Transport that shipments will be made at the rateof 27.500 tons per month.Supply of Tyres to Colonies.98. Difficulties have developed over the supply of motor tyres and tubesto those Colonies, namely, East African Colonies, Mauritius and the Gold Coastthat had been asked to turn to the Union of South Africa for supplies. several of these Governments have stated that they have found it impossible to securethe quantity of tyres and tubes that it had been hoped to obtain from the union and the method of meeting the essential requirements for these Colonies is atpresent under urgent discussion.East African Coffee Prices.99. As a result of recent negotiations between the Ministry of Food andthe Director of Produce Disposal in East Africa, who was accompanied on his recent visit to this country by a Coffee Executive of the East African CoffeeControl, a price which has been agreed in respect of the 1944-45 crop which will ensure that the producers obtain a fair return for their produce, and that adjust-ments in subsequent years in accordance with variations in certain specific items
of costs of production will be made on a formula to be agreed with the east african Governors&apos; Conference.Rubber.100. Discussions have been held in London with officials of the UnitedStates and Netherlands Governments at which the whole world situationregarding rubber was reviewed. The talks were held in a spirit of cordialityand it was agreed that the questions of future supply and demand were all acommon concern to all those countries. It was decided that each Governmentshould appoint a Study Group to continue further examination of the problems involved.Citrus Exports from Palestine and Cyprus.101. Ministry of Food are arranging for the shipment to this country of1,000.000 cases of oranges from Palestine between mid-November and mid-January1945. Negotiations on price are still proceeding. The Ministry have also agreedto take 200,000 cases from Cyprus subject to satisfactory arrangements as regardsprice and shipping arrangements.Defence.102. On 5th June there was widespread rioting by the Somaliland CamelCorps at Burao, Somaliland. The Commander of the Area concerned attributesthe outbreak to the circulation of false rumours regarding the treatment whichSomaliland ranks were likely to receive in Kenya, to which the Corps was under orders to move. The civil population of the town appear to have assisted therioters. There were no casualties, but a quantity of arms and stores were stolen.The G.O.C.-in-C, East Africa, after consultation with the Military Governor,British Somaliland, has reduced the Camel Corps to a nominal cadre. The futureof the Corps is under consideration.103. Japanese air reconnaissance of the Cocos Islands has continued andculminated in a bombing attack early in August. Mr. Clunies-Ross, the proprietorof Cocos, died from natural causes on the 14th August, and the Commander-in-Chief, Ceylon, after consultation with the Supreme Allied Commander, South-East Asia Command, and myself, has arranged for a military officer to be sent tothe islands for the time being.Civil A aviation.British West Indian Airways.104. The three Hudsons which are being supplied to the Company have been modified at Dorval and are now being made available to the Company.105. It has been agreed that these aircraft should be purchased from government funds and should be made available for the Company&apos;s use at a nominal rental.106. Agreement has also been given in principle to the payment of a subsidy to the Company to enable them to expand their services.in the Caribbean area.Discussions are now proceeding as to the conditions on which the payments willbe made.Barbados Caribbean A irivays.107. A company with the above name was recently registered in Barbadosto operate air services between that island and other places in the West Indies and elsewhere. Although provision was made for nominal British control of thecompany, it was clear that it would be effectively controlled by Pan-american airways and would be used by the latter to operate air services in a British sphere of interest. As this would have endangered the policy adopted of supportingBritish West Indian Airways in the maintenance of an effective British air service in the Caribbean area, the Governor of Barbados was instructed to refuse a licence for the new company to operate from Barbados.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.108. On the 8th August the High Commissioner and Lady MacMichael weremotoring to a farewell function when their car, under police escort, was ambushedjust outside Jerusalem and fire was opened with tommy-guns from the side ofthe road. Sir Harold MacMichael was very slightly wounded, Lady MacMichaelwas unhurt, the A.D.C., Major Nieholls, was shot through the lung and seriously
hurt, and the police driver was also seriously wounded in the neck. The assailantsescaped, but several men were seen running from the engagement and entering theJewish Settlement of Givat Shaul. Preparations at the scene of the crime had apparently been made under cover of bogus survey operations. Police cordonedthe Settlement immediately, but no one in the Settlement volunteered or gave any useful information. All available information points to the fact that theperpetrators of this and other recent outrages, and their active supporters whohave openly boasted of their responsibility for what has been done and their intention to continue it, are more than a small body of terrorists and form partof a widespread organisation. A fine of  500 has been imposed on the JewishSettlement of Givat Shaul for failure to assist the police who were investigating the crime. Arab opinion violently condemned the attack on the High Commis-sioner, and he received innumerable messages of congratulations from everyquarter. Apart from abhorrence on this particular attack. Arabs are showingincreasing concern at the audacity of the extent of the Jewish terroristorganisation, which they fear will be ultimately used against themselves. Publicpronouncements in the&apos;Jewish press and by Jewish Agency leaders expressedhorror at the attack on Sir Harold Mac-Michael, emphasising that public interestrequired the rooting out of terrorists. There were signs, however, of mentalreservation in many press items and subsequent criticism of the fine imposed on the Settlement of Givat Shaul.109. Conviction that the war in Europe will soon end has caused public attention to focus more than ever on local affairs, and both the Jewish and ArabCommunities are speculating freely on the settlement of the Palestine problem.Arab politicians are unable to agree among themselves on any constructive policyand factional activity and propaganda hold the field. The promoters of the ArabNational Fund are active and have sent an emissary to seek the support of theLebanese and Syrian Governments for the extension of the Fund&apos;s activities tothose countries. The Palestine Arab Party policy remains active; it has gainedsome-ground, but lacks effective leadership and has so far failed to attain acommanding position. Support of Zionist aims by the Democratic Party inAmerica aroused bitter Arab comments.110. The main feature of Jewish affairs has been the elections to theAssephath Flanivcharim (Community Council). They resulted in a substantialvictory for the Mapai (Palestine Labour Party) who gained 63 out of 171 seats,the remaining seats being distributed amongst 16 factions. The next largest,group (also Labour) won only 21 seats. The new Assembly is consequentlystiffened by a considerable proportion committed to support the Biltmoreprogramme, maximal Zionism, and a nationally organised Socialistic regime.The elections for the Histaclruth (General Federation of Jewish Labour) havealso taken place, but final results are not yet available. The indications up todate, however, are that the Mapai is supreme. Jewish opinion has been muchexcited by renewed rumours of Partition.Gibraltar.111. A further contingent of Gibraltar evacuees numbering about 550persons left the United Kingdom on repatriation to Gibraltar.112, The transfer to Northern Ireland of those Gibraltar evacuees whowere accommodated in this country in Centres administered by the Ministry ofHealth was completed, except for a small number who, owing to their own illnessor the serious illness of relatives, could not be moved.Fiji and the Western Pacific.113. In response to a personal invitation from Admiral Nimitz, Major-General Sir Philip Mitchell, Governor of Fiji and High Commissioner for theWestern Pacific, arrived at Pearl Harbour on the 22nd August for a stay of four or five days.Ceylon.114. Administration of the Port of Colombo. Serious delays in the turn-round of shipping at Colombo have been under consideration by the PrincipalAdministrative Officers&apos; Department and by the Chiefs of Staff. TheCommander-in-Chief, Ceylon, has strengthened &quot;the membership of the ShippingPriority Committee, and the Shipping athuorities are studying the practicability of making further arrangements for co-ordinating shipments to Ceylon so as toavoid the arrival of difficult cargo combinations.
