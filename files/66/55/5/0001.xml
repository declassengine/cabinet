THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 505.7th September, 1944.WAR CABINET.MEMBERS OE THE BRITISH UNION DETAINED under regulation 18b.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.IN the memorandum which I circulated to the War Cabinet in April 1943(W.P. (43) 148) I stated that, while the number of persons who had been detainedbecause of their associations with the British Union totalled 747, this numberhad by April 1943 been reduced to 130. Of the persons originally detained as members of the British Union some were found, on investigation, to be personswho had been attracted by the patriotic slogans of the Union and had not realised the danger that the Union might be used for the purpose of hindering the war effort, and many of them were found to be persons with no political knowledgewho had joined the Union because of personal grievances of various kinds.The policy of reviewing each of the cases periodically has been continued and, with the changes in the war situation, it has been possible, since April 1943,to release many more. As regards some of them, it became clear that there hadbeen a change in their views and that they were now ready to help rather thanhinder the war effort. As regards others, the chances of their either being willingor being able to cause any substantial hindrance to the war effort were so smallthat their detention was felt to be no longer necessary.The total number of persons who are still detained on the ground of membership of the British Union has now come down to 15. Five of these arepersons who held leading positions in the headquarters organisation of theBritish Union; the remaining ten are individuals whose release has hitherto been felt to be unwise for special reasons. A few of them are British subjects of hostile origin, whose sympathies with the enemy are clue to their origin and familyconnections. The remainder are mainly persons who have a fanatical obsessionin favour of ;&apos; national socialism &apos;&apos; and have openly expressed themselves asdesirous of a German victory or have been concerned in overt acts prejudicial tothe defence of the realm.If hostilities should cease in Europe at an early date and Regulation 18bshould thereupon be repealed, all these persons will automatically be released. .If, however, a position is not reached for some little time at which Regulation 18bcan be repealed, I propose to review each of these remaining 15 cases and toconsider the release of a mmber of them, including the leaders.The five leaders are E^ancis Hawkins, who was the Director-General of theBritish Union; B. D. E. Donovan, who was the Assistant Director-General;H. G. McKechnie; who was the Senior Administrator for London;A. Raven-Thompson, who was the Editor of Action and styled Director of Policy;and E. G. (&quot;Mick&quot;) Clarke, who was Propaganda Organiser for London andan effective mob orator.The danger that these people could or would wish to revive the British union or any similar organisation is at the present date small and in any case unlikely to be effective. With the possible exception of Clarke I doubt if any of them has sufficient initiative or ability to organise a movement of any importance evenif he wished to do so.Of the former members of the British Union there are some who still adhere to the British Union ideas, and there are occasional small private meetings ofsome of these former adherents. But from the watch that has been kept it appearsclear that the organisation is dead and that the great majority of the formeradherents have been disillusioned and are unlikely to rally to any organisation which attempts to revive the old British Union policy.The danger that in the post-hostilities period some attempts may be madeto substitute for parliamentary and constitutional methods the doctrine of&quot; direct action &quot; and &quot; the strong hand &quot; in politics cannot, of course, be ignored,but, as all these people will have to be released in airy case at the termination of[28175]
hostilities in Europe, this consideration is irrelevant to the question whetherthey should be released now or a little later.Subject, therefore, to the consideration of any views my colleagues mayexpress, I propose to proceed with a policy which may result in release of practically all the remaining members of the British Union in the course of amonth or two. They will be released subject to conditions which will enablesupervision to be kept over them, and if the revocation of Regulation 18b doesnot come about for some little time it will be possible, by means of these conditions,to keep a close check on their activities.British Union Funds.There is another matter relating to the British Union to which I should refer. A provision was made in Defence Regulation 18aa for the winding up ofthe Union, and at the time when the Regulation was made it was contemplated that an application might be made under paragraph 4 of Defence Regula-tion 18aa for a High Court order controlling any property held by the Union and providing for confiscation to the Crown of any funds remaining after the financial obligations of the organisation had been met.The unravelling of the financial affairs of the British Union proved to be an extremely difficult and complicated task (its financial organisation was spreadover a number of inter-locking companies), but the general result of the enquirieswas to show that the companies as a group had no assets, and, indeed, it appearedprobable that, if application were made for a High Court order, Sir Oswald Mosleymight have a claim to such assets, if any. as there may be, since in the years pre-ceding the war, when the Union was encountering great financial difficulties, hehad assisted it with large contributions amounting to nearly  100.000 from his personal resources.Defence Regulation 18aa is one of those which it is proposed to revoke on thetermination of hostilities in Europe, and recently the question has again beenconsidered whether application ought to be made for a High Court order beforethe Regulation ceases to operate. The conclusion, however, which has been reached as a result of this examination is that an application for such an order wouldinvolve an unjustifiable expenditure of public time and money and that the prolonged investigation which would be needed, for the purposes of a High Courtorder, into the affairs of these derelict and apparently bankrupt companies wouldnot be warranted. The Attorney-General concurs in this view, and I understandthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was Home Secretary at the time whenthe Regulation was made, is of the same opinion.The Case of Captain Ramsay, M.P.If the remaining leaders of the British Union are released before Regula-tion 18b is revoked, the question of releasing Captain Ramsay will also have tobe considered. Captain Ramsay is detained on the ground that he had been concerned in &quot; acts prejudicial &quot; to the defence of the realm. Hitherto I havenot felt it justifiable to authorise the release of Captain Ramsay, partly because there has been no change in the strange views which led him to the indefensibleactivities necessitating his detention and the risk of his again indulging inirresponsible and mischievous, actions could not be ignored, and partly because itwould be impossible to subject him. if released, to restrictive conditions such asthose which have been applied to other persons who have been released under regulation 18b.As a Member of Parliament, he must be free to attend Parliament and tomove about Great Britain for the purpose of visiting his constituency and for anyother purposes connected with his duties as an M.P. No conditions preventinghim engaging in political activities or in associating with his former adherentswould be possible. Moreover, as an M.P. he would be entitled to attend any secret session of the House. Nevertheless, the time is fast approaching when the repeal of Regulation 18b may, in any case, result in his release, and the war situation isnow such that any danger arising from irresponsible and mischievous activitieson the part of Captain Ramsay is greatly reduced- If, therefore, the repeal of regulation 18b is deferred for some little time and in the interval the remainingleaders of the British Union are released, I incline to the view subject to theconsideration of any opinions expressed by my colleagues -that it would be theright course to release Captain Ramsay, choosing for this purpose an appropriatedate, which may occur quite early.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1,   *7th September, 1944.
