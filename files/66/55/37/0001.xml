NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   No shipping losses have been reported during the week.Allied warships have carried out bombardments in the Gulf of Genoa, the adriatic, and the JEgean.U.S. warships and carrier-borne aircraft have successfully attacked Japaneseshipping and aircraft in the Philippines.Three U-boats have been sunk.Norwegian Waters.2. The Tirpitz was bombed on the 15th in Altenfjord by Lancasters of bomber Command operating from a Russian base. Surprise was achieved, andthe first crews identified the battleship before the smoke screen was effective.It is believed that one hit was obtained with a 12,000-lb. armour-piercing bomb,although photographic evidence has not yet confirmed this. There was A/A but no fighter opposition, and all aircraft returned safely to their home bases.Later reconnaissance showed the Tirpitz still afloat; but she may have been seriously damaged.On&apos; the 11th HAL S/M Venturer torpedoed a laden 3,000-ton ship offthe Naze.   On the 13th she shelled a 1,300-ton ship off Egersund.Home Waters.3. Good progress has been made with the repair of the French and Belgianharbours held by the Allies. At Ostend K-boat pens suitable for a coastal base were found intact, and there is undamaged oil storage for 300 tons. At Le Treportdamage to the port installations was not severe and 14 berths were expected tobe available by the 19th for small coasters.At Havre the demolition of the harbour and facilities is 90 per cent, complete and it cannot be used for large tonnage for some time. Limited unloading fromcoasters alongside will be possible when the roads are clear of debris. There isplenty of local labour. The entry of small ships is permitted subject to pre-cautions. The Seine is blocked at two points by sunken ships and there are fourminefields in the approaches : it is estimated that Rouen cannot be opened for amonth.   At Cherbourg the entrance to the Darse Atlantique is now clear.At Brest the harbour installations have been destroyed, with the exceptionof a 150-ton crane. The U-boat pens, with power and workshops, are intact, and much of the water-front can be made workable in a short time. The port ofConcarneau, near Lorient, which has been swept by French naval forces, can beused by ships up to 3.000 tons.4. On the night of the 14th/15th M.T.Bs sank a 2,000-ton escorted shipnorthbound off Vlieland. On the night of the 16th 17th E-boats attempting to operate off the East Coast were driven off by H.M.S. Hambledon (destroyer).There was considerable E-boat activity north of Dunkirk on the night of the13th/19th, and during a number of engagements H.M.S. Stayner (frigate) andtwo M.T.Bs sank three E-boats, taking 37 prisoners.The totals unloaded in Normandy up to p.m. on the 17th were 2,268,612men, 468,299 vehicles and 4.040.489 tons of stores.5. The German hospital ship Rostock (ex-French St. Maurice, 2.542 tons)was sighted by an aircraft and intercepted by M.T.B. 096 off Lorient on the16th, and was escorted to Plymouth for examination.Mediterranean.6. On the 12th and the 13th the French cruiser Gloire and the U.S.destroyer Ludlow shelled positions on the Franco-Italian border in support ofthe army. On the following day Ludloiv continued the bombardment, damagingtwo ships in Oneglia harbour, where the U.S. destroyer Edison damaged a third.Allied coastal forces have also been active nightly in the Gulf of Genoa. On the11th/12th two barges were sunk and an F-lighter left on fire. On subsequentnights a destroyer and eight F-lighters were sunk and another F-lighter was seton fire.

On the 15th Loyal and Kimberley (destroyers)shelled gun positions and road junctions. Next day Kimberley shelled troops and batteries under heavy but ineffective return fire. On the 17th and the 18thLoyal and Lookout (destroyers) continued the bombardment. Allied coastalforces off the Dalmatian coast on the night of the 15th/16th sank four ships anda large landing craft.8. Operations have continued in the iEgean against the German withdrawal from the Greek islands. On the night of the 12th/13th reconnaissance of Kitheraby two M.L.s, covered by H.M.S. Whaddon (destroyer), showed that the enemy had evacuated the island after having destroyed their equipment. On the night of the 14th/15th H.M. ships Royalist (cruiser) and Teazer (destroyer) sank two ships north of Suda Bay, Crete. An escort carrier force has also operated, and between the 16th and 19th aircraft from the carriers attacked motor transport at Candia and Suda Bay and destroyed 85 vehicles. H.M.S.

The third U-boat, which was fitted with a &quot; schnorkel,&quot;&apos; was sunk north of Crete by the Polish destroyer Garland and H.M. destroyers.On the 18th Mosquitoes probably damaged a U-boat which they attackedheavily in a fjord near Bergen.Enemy Intelligence.13. Photographic reconnaissance shows that since the 2nd the Prinz Eugen,the Koln, and probably the Emden. have left Gdynia.U-boats.14. It is believed that inshore patrols are still being maintained off the northCornwall coast, and in the North Channel area. About six U-boats are on patroloff Bear Island (Barents Sea) and a few in the Atlantic, including some inCanadian waters.On the 18th 26 U-boats were seen at Kiel : on the 15th there were 14 atKonigsberg and 36 at Danzig.Of the new types of U-boat now in production. 11 of the 1.600-ton type and about 10 of the 250-ton type have now been completed and may shortly beoperational.A German one-man midget submarine has been captured on the Arras-Albertroad and brought to this country.Enemy Attack on Shipping.15.   No attacks on shipping have been reported during the week.Protection of Seaborne Trade.16. During the week ending the 17th, 704 ships in convoy in the north atlantic arrived at their destinations. Of these, 282 were in ocean convoys and422 in British coastal convoys. Forty destroyers (including 15 U.S. destroyers)and 79 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes, were employed on escort duties.Four home-bound convoys consisting of 204 ships and &quot;three outward-bound convoys of 78 ships reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.17. Aircraft have laid mines in the Baltic and in the Kattegat and offKiel, the Elbe, and the Norwegian coast.Allied aircraft have laid mines in the Tavoy river in Burma.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.18. There have been no reports of minelaying by enemy aircraft in home waters, but E-boats may have laid mines off Yarmouth on one night of theweek.A channel has been established from Dunkirk to Ostenci, where sweepingof the harbour is in progress. Clearance of the harbour and approaches atHavre is now completed.A Belgian tug was sunk by mine in the Schelde on the 12th, and an M.L.was damaged and beached in the harbour entrance at Ostend.19.

(An outline map is included as an inset.)General.23. After a quiet spell when the Allied Armies were mainly preoccupied with building up their administrative resources and fighting minor engagementsfor position, the pace of events in Western Europe durng the last week has againquickened, and notable and spectacular successes have been won.Southern Group of A armies.24. In Southern France U.S. and French forces, which have been swinging-right-handed on a hinge S.W. of Belfort and had made contact with theThird U.S. Army further north, have made limited advances at the approaches to the Belfort Gap against increasing enemy resistance, which has been speciallystubborn near the Swiss border. On Friday, the 15th, General Eisenhowerassumed command of the forces in Southern France; thus all the Allied forces in western Europe are now under a single commander, and present an unbrokenfront to Germany which extends 400 miles from the Swiss border near Belfort tothe North Sea and also a further 150 miles in the south along the Franco-Italianborder. In this latter area the town of Modane was captured on the 15th andfurther advances have since been made. The enemy is reported to have blown theFrench exit of the Mont Cenis Tunnel.Central Group of Armies.25. The Third U.S. Army in the Saar sector has maintained a steadypressure on the enemy,&quot; which has brought some useful gains. Nancy fell on the15th, and since then forward troops have pushed out east and south of the town toa depth of some 30 miles capturing Luneville and Epinal. Resistance is strong and stubborn at Metz, but U.S. troops are gradually closing on the town, while tothe north of it they have captured Thionville.Further north, the First U.S. Army, which at the beginning of the weekcaptured Maastricht, Eupen and Malmedy, has crossed the frontier into germany at a number of places, and has penetrated the defences of the Siegfried Line in strength between Aachen and Trier. Fighting has been heavy in the neighbour-hood of Aachen, where the town itself is being encircled, while leading elementshave pushed out over 12 miles to the east and within 30 miles of Cologne.In Brittany the long investment of Brest ended on the 19th, when organised resistance ceased in the town and the enemy were driven from the Crozonpeninsula. The German Commander, General Ramcke, had only shortly beforerejected an appeal from General Middleton of the 8th U.S. Corps to surrender,and very bitter street fighting went on before its final capture.Northern Group of Armies.26. At the beginning of this week the Second British Army was engagedin very heavy and bitter fighting on the lines of the Albert and Escaut canals,where the enemy was spending himself recklessly in an attempt to eliminate ourbridgeheads, which nevertheless were successfully held.
On Sunday the 17th the situation was suddenly transformed when the FirstAllied Airborne Army, which includes British, U.S. and Polish formations,launched the greatest single airborne operation of the war in support of theNorthern Group of Armies.These airborne operations, which were preceded by an intense air bombard-ment to neutralise ground defences, had a marked initial success. The landingsappear to have achieved tactical surprise; aircraft and glider losses were small,and pilots returning, from the operation reported that very little flak was met.Meanwhile, armoured forces of the Second British Army launched a violentattack from their bridgeheads and, breaking out northwards in the face of heavyopposition, linked up with the southernmost of the airborne forces in the areaof Eindhoven on the 18th.Further north, airborne forces, which had landed in the areas of Nijmegen,Grave and Arnhem, met with stiff opposition, and although they secured thebridge over the Meuse at Grave intact, they were unable to take the bridges overthe Waal (main stream of the Rhine) at Nijmegen, and over the Neder Rijn(lower Rhine) at Arnhem. The ground forces in the area of Eindhoven, however,rapidly drove forward an armoured corridor to Nijmegen, where after bitterfighting, the important road and railway bridges were captured intact on the20th. These forces are now within 8-10 miles of Arnhem where airborne forces are still fighting for possession of the bridges.In the coastal sector an all-out assault has been launched on Boulogne.Canadian troops have fought their way into the town and captured the citadel,but some centres of resistance are still holding out. Further north, canadian and Polish troops are pressing the enemy back against the estuary of the Schelde,which according to reports at present unconfirmed the Poles have reached on a six-mile front east of Terneuzen.Italy...... (An outline map is included as an inset.)27. The enemy continues to reinforce his troops in the Adriatic sector andto resist all advances by our troops in a most resolute manner. On the coast aGreek brigade has been brought into the line and has fought its way to the outskirts of the village of Abissinia. which lies about two miles down the coastfrom Rimini. After the capture of the Coriano-S. Savino ridge, Canadian andBritish troops quickly (pushed forward and gained bridegheads over the RiverMarano. The high ground to the north and N.W. of this river is now being attacked; Canadian troops have got a firm foothold on the ridge in the area ofthe village of Fortunato, but the enemy still holds a number of the high crests.Further inland. British troops are in similar position on the ridge of the areaof the village of Coriano. Both these ridges dominate the surrounding country-side, and are therefore of great importance to operations in this sector.On the Fifth Army front extensive minefields and demolitions have been encountered in the area S.E. of Firenzuola; in addition the countryside is extremely mountainous. Nevertheless, British and U.S. troops, as a result ofclays of hard and bitter fighting, have captured a number of very important highfeatures. These features were heavily fortified, and concrete pill-boxes anddug-in positions extended right to their crests. Further westwards towards thecoast, active patrol work has been maintained, resulting in small advances along the whole front. In the coastal area Brazilian troops, who are in action for thefirst time in Italy, together with U.S. troops, have occupied Viareggio and havepushed forward to reach the village of Pietrasanta.The Russo-German Campaign.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Finland.28. The armistice between Russia and Finland was signed on the 19th.The two countries had previously agreed that the Germans should be granted the period up to the 15th for evacuating their troops from Finland, but theGermans made no attempt to do this. They have, however, referred to theirdisengagement movements in Finland and state that the Russians have beeninterfering with these. A German attempt to occupy the Finnish island ofHoglancl, in the Gulf of Finland, on the night of the 14th/15th, failed after asmall beachhead had been temporarily gained.
Northern Sector.29. A fresh Russian offensive in the northern sector has now been inprogress for some days. The Russians have advanced up to 40 miles west ofNarva and 45 miles N.W. of Tartu. The railway junction of Valka has been captured and some ground gained due east of Riga. South of Riga the russians have advanced on a wide front and at one point are within 10 miles of the town.Meanwhile attacks by German forces in the area west of Jelgava have been repulsed.Central Sector.30. On the 14th the Russians captured Praga, the important suburb ofWarsaw lying on the east bank of the Vistula.S.W. of Przemysl a new thrust has brought the Russians to the frontier of czechoslovakia.Balkan Sector.31. The Russians continue to extend the area held by them in Transylvania.They are within 15 miles of Cluj, advancing along Muresul valley, and havetaken Timisoara. Fighting between Germans and Hungarians on the one side and Rumanians on the other has taken place in the areas of Oradea and Arad.In Bulgaria Russian troops have reached Sofia, which was occupied onthe 16th.Yugoslavia.32. Bulgarian forces have been engaged against the Germans on manyroads crossing the Bulgar/ Yugoslavia frontier.The Partisans have made contact with the Red Army on the Danube S.W.of Turnu--Severin.In their drive towards Belgrade the Partisans claim the capture of Lajkovac(30 miles south of Belgrade). In this advance they have driven back a jointMihailovic-Nedic force of some 17,000 and have overrun Mihailovic&apos;s HQ.The Partisans have reduced the German hold on Yugoslavia in many otherparts and have occupied the Dalmatian islands of Korcula, Hvar Mljet and Brae.Greece.33. A British commando force has occupied the island of Kythera off theSouthern Peloponnese.E.L.A.S. forces have continued to cut the important railway between Athensand Salonika and attacked the German garrison at Mestovon.In the Peloponnese the Germans have made further withdrawals and now only hold the areas within 20 miles of Patras and Corinth. E.A.M. have taken over control of a number of the towns evacuated by the Germans.Burma.A arakan.34. Small-scale clashes have taken place in an area on the Mayu Range,seven miles east of Maungdaw.Chin Hills and Chindwin.35. Our troops crossed-the Manipur River during their advance towardsTiddim on the 16th. They occupied Tuitum and a feature four miles S.S.E. ofthe village on the 18th.Pacific.36. On the 14th, a force from a U.S. Infantry Division&apos; landed on Morotai,the northernmost island in the Halmahera- group. They encountered no opposition.  Work on construction of an airfield has already begun.U.S. Army and &quot;Marine forces landed on Peleliu, in the Palau groupsix hundred and fifty miles N.E. of the Halmaheras on the 15th. Progress hasbeen good, and Peleliu airfield is now in American hands. A landing was madeby the U.S. troops on Anguar Island, the most southerly of the Pafaus, on the17th.   Enemy opposition is stiff on both these islands.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Bremerhaven (attacked on night 19th/20th). Preliminary interpretation of photographs of fair quality taken on the 20th September shows that the twomost closely built-up areas, north and south of the harbour entrance, have been completely devastated. Most of the warehouses and dockside buildings havebeen gutted and some of them are still burning. Only the most northern andmost southern suburbs have escaped complete devastation.Castrop-Ratuvel. The attack in daylight on the 11th September by bomber command caused varying degrees of damage throughout the synthetic oil plant and nitrogen works of Klockner-werke (a Fischertropsch plant). The ammoniaplant, the nitric acid plant and by-produts plant have all been damaged, as havethe blower or compressor houses. There is some business and residentialdamage in the district north of the target.Chemnitz.

A large gas-holder has been destroyed.Hanover. As the result of U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 11th September,considerable fresh damage has been inflicted on the Hanomag tank and locomotiveworks. The poor quality of the prints precludes definite interpretation, butamong the buildings affected are the armour plating and assembly shop, power plant, foundry, offices and three machine shops. Several hits on the east end ofthe marshalling yard bordering the south side of the works have caused damage to tracks, goods sheds and rolling stock.Hopstein Airfield.

The most severe damage includes the whole or partialgutting of three dye-stuffs warehouses, the partial destruction of a laboratorybuilding, heavy damage to the western half of the Butanol manufacturing plant and the destruction of about half a possible caustic soda concentration building.Magdeburg. Drifting clouds prevent a detailed interpretation of the damage caused by the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 11th and 12th September, butit can be seen that at least 12 of the 22 buildings in the ordnance depot have been affected. Of those which can be identified, the ramped standard building hasbeen half destroyed and damage generally is severe.Damage has also been caused to port facilities in the port area immediatelynorth of the ordnance depot, and to the south-west the large exhibition buildings of Ausstellungs-Gelande, near the Stadt-Ffalle, have been almost completely destroyed.Merseburg.
