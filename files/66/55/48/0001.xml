naval SITUATION.General Review.1.   A convoy from the United Kingdom has arrived in North Russia without loss.Allied destroyers have carried out bombardments in the Gulf of Genoa andin the Adriatic.Allied submarines have attacked enemy shipping off the coast of Norway,and in the JEgean and East Indies.U.S. carrier-borne aircraft have carried out a successful attack onManila Bay.Northern Waters.2. On the 23rd, a convoy of 33 ships from the United Kingdom coveredby ships of the Home Fleet arrived in North Russia without loss.On the 20th, H.M. S/M Sceptre torpedoed and probably sank two ships,of 7,000 and 3,000 tons, in an escorted convoy off the Norwegian coast.Home Waters.3. The Polish destroyers. Blyskavnca and Piorun carried out a landing atAudierne on the 20th. No opposition was met; the F.F.I. were found to bedisarming German trawlers and had taken 300 prisoners.On the 23rd, H.M.C.S. lroquois (destroyer) made a landing at Les Sablesd&apos;01onne and obtained from the F.F.I. detailed information of the defences ofLa Rochelle and La Pallice, where the enemy strength was estimated to be 15,000.4. A large enemy force is reported to be in and around Saint Nazaire, wherethe port has been prepared for demolition and several vessels are available foruse as block ships. The Germans here have a ferry-service in operation across theLoire which keeps their communications open with another, but much smaller,enemy force in the Pays de Retz. At Lorient, which is also still in German hands,preparations for demolition in the port area have been made, but a hulk whichhas been sunk in the Rade is in such a position that it does not block the riverentrance. Further south as many as 15,000 Germans are estimated to be at large and under arms in and around La Rochelle and La Pallice, but are not in communication with the enemy pockets in Brittany by sea. At Havre a wholeseries of concealed demolition-charges, some of them containing nearly a ton of explosive, have been located underwater alongside various quays. At Gravelinesmany quays were demolished before the town was liberated, and the entrance lockto the Port d&apos;Echouage was completely blocked with rubble. At Calais, which isstill in enemy hands, jetties and quays have been partly demolished. The locksleading to the Bassin Carnot have been almost destroyed, and the wrecks of tenvessels of various sizes are partly blocking the entrance channel and the entrance to the Bassin Carnot. So much clearance has been effected at Ostend that at high tide a fairway 50 yards wide into the harbour can be used by small coasters.Four ships can be berthed in the Avant Port. Photographs show that largenewly-launched hulls have been used, or are in position to be used, for blockingthe approaches to Rotterdam, Ijmuiden and Amsterdam. By the 25th, Dieppeharbour could take 12 coasters and a train ferry. At Antwerp 15 dry docks andthe shipyards were captured practically intact. At Boulogne the harbour entrancewas found to have been blocked by 26 sunken craft, but a 250-ft. channel is likelyto be cleared by the first week in October. In the Bassin-a-Flot there are12 wrecks and a sunken floating dock; the Bassin Loubet is fouled by six wrecksand a number of cranes. The port can be made available for limited tonnage assoon as the channel is cleared. At Brest, both town and harbour have been very seriously damaged. No alongside berths are available and all unloading facilitieshave been destroyed. The main breakwater entrance is partially blocked, butthere is one clear gap of 400 feet.5. On the 25th, the U.S. minelayer Micmtonomah was mined and sunk offthe entrance to Havre, and on the 27th, H.M.S. Rockingham (target ship for naval aircraft) was mined and sunk off Aberdeen.Mediterranean.6. Unloading figures on the coast of Provence up to the 24th were 346,441men, 63,235 vehicles and 308,306 tons of stores.
324GSeventeen ships may now be berthed alongside at Marseilles and nine atToulon.On the 19th and 20th. the U.S. destroyer Ludlow shelled targets in theVentimiglia area, and on the 22nd and 23rd, the U.S. destroyers Edison andWoolsey shelled enemy batteries and storage dumps on the Franco-italian frontier. U.S. and French destroyers continued the bombardment of theVentimiglia area on the 25th and 26th.7. Destroyer bombardments off the Adriatic coast continued during theweek. On the 20th, H.M. ships Kimberley and Lookout silenced an enemy batterynorth-west of Rimini and on the 22nd, 24th and 25th Loyal and Lookoutcontinued the bombardment.8. Between the 16th and 23rd, landing craft operated in the southernDalmatian islands transporting commandos and partisans to harass the german withdrawal. On the night of the 23rd/24th, two landing craft, operating southof Drvenik, were unsuccessfully attacked by E-boats. Coastal forces sank threelighters off the Dalmatian coast.9. In the Ionian Sea, on the 23rd, FI.M. destroyers Whaddon and Belvoirengaged three enemy vessels, probably torpedo boats, off the Albanian coast.One of the enemy was set on fire and possibly sunk. Early on the following day,Ii.M. destroyers Zetland and Brecon shelled a cargo ship in Argostoli roads.10. On the 22nd, H.M. S/M Vampire torpedoed and probably sank a3.000-ton ship in the northern aegean. On the night of the 24th/25th, H.M.destroyers Terpsichore and Termagant destroyed a convoy of five enemy craftoff Scarpanto and coastal forces drove a caique ashore at Milo. On the 26th,H.M. S/M Vigorotis probably sank a west-bound ship of 1,500-tons south-east of Salonika.East Indies.11. H.M. and Allied submarines operating in the Malacca Strait and offthe coast of Sumatra have reported as follows : Sirdar attacked a convoy north-west of Sumatra on the 2nd; one coaster was driven ashore, and an escort andanother ship were damaged by gunfire. Tantivy sank a 4,000-ton ship west of the Sunda Strait on the 4th. Between the 4th and the 10th, the DutchS/M 0.19 sank a sampan and two coasters by gunfire. Stygian sank a smallschooner and took three prisoners.   Spirit sank two junks and took two prisoners.Pacific.12. On the 21st about 500 U.S. carrier-borne aircraft attacked targets inManila Bay. It is reported that one enemy destroyer, five tankers and three cargo ships were sunk and one destroyer, two tankers, a floating dock and 23 cargo ships were damaged; 110 Japanese aircraft were destroyed in the air and 95on the ground. Fifteen U.S. aircraft were lost but no warship was damaged.A further attack was made on the next day, but no details have yet been received.Anti-Submarine Operations.13. Nine attacks were reported during&quot; the week, six of them by shore-based aircraft and three by warships.On the 24th, Liberators sank a U-boat in the Gulf of Salamis. On the 18thand 26th, promising attacks were carried out by aircraft off the Norwegian coast.Enemy Intelligence.14. On the 20th, reconnaissance showed the Tirpitz in Altenfiord. Twoanti-aircraft ships, a depot ship with a U-boat alongside, a landing craft, a tankerand a cargo ship were also present. Two tankers had left since the 15th and twoNarvik class destroyers and a hospital ship had left since the 22nd August.Reconnaissance of Trondheim on the 22nd showed a catapult ship, an air-craft tender, an armed transport, a minesweeper, six landing craft, three E/Rboats and a U-boat im dock, and six auxiliaries. Fourteen cargo and passengerships and a tanker were also present.[28301] B
U-boats.15. Within the next week most of the U-boats on passage from Biscay ports should have arrived in Norway.It is doubtful whether any U-boats are now on patrol off the north Cornishcoast or off the south coast of Ireland (R), but an inshore patrol is probably still being maintained in the North Channel.   The situation is quiet elsewhere.Of the new types of U-boat now in production, 37 of the 1,600-ton type arebuilding. 13 are fitting out and 11 are completed; nine of the 250-ton type arebuilding, four are fitting out and seven to ten are completed.Enemy Attack on Shipping.16. During the week a U.S. ship was torpedoed off the south-west coast of iceland (C) but reached port. A British ship was damaged by a mine offMarseilles.Protection of Seaborne Trade.17. Information under this heading will in future be given monthly and notweekly as heretofore.Allied Minelaying.18. There has been no minelaying during the week. On the 1st. HATS.Ariadne (fast minelayer) laid mines in the Wewak area.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.19. There have been no reports of enemy minelaying in Home Waters duringthe week.Operations, somewhat restricted by heavy weather, have continued in Ostendharbour and anchorage. Six moored and three magnetic mines have been destroyed and the first two cargo ships carrying stores entered the harbour onthe 25th.Eight wooden motor minesweepers and a mine destructor ship are in various stages of completion in Antwerp yards.Since the 15th, 24 magnetic, four acoustic and some 60 ground mines havebeen destroyed off Havre and the approach channels. The anchorage and thebeach north of the town were clear of mines by the 24th, and the Seine will nowbe swept to Rouen.20. Another 13 moored mines have been destroyed between Mentone andVentimiglia, five ground mines in the Marseilles basins and two mines inToulon.During minesweeping operations off Ancona between the 26th July andthe 4th September, 38 ground mines and 71 moored mines have been destroyed.The hospital ship St. Andrew was mined off Pesaro on the 23rd and wastowed into Bari.Another eight moored mines have been destroyed in the Kithera Channel.Russian minesweepers have destroyed five ground mines in the Black Sea.The mine totals are 5,667 ground and 5,978 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.21. It is reported that a large number of Norwegian vessels and themajority of Dutch motor coasters, tugs and barges operating for the enemy in norwegian waters have been laid up for lack of fuel oil.22. On the 18th, six German ships, which had taken refuge at Pasajes, wereinterned. These were the aircraft tenders Immelmann and Richtofen, the navaltanker Brosen and three air sea rescue ships.Swedish Iron Ore.23. During August, shipments of Swedish iron ore to enemy Europeamounted to 551,486 tons, compared with 808,352 tons in the previous month.During August 1943 the total was 1.101,900 tons. Of the 551,486 tons some441,000 tons were shipped through Swedish ports, and some 110,000 tons throughNarvik. Now that Swedish ports may no longer be used for this traffic the enemywill have to rely entirely upon Narvik.
Russian Intelligence.24. The Russian fleet in the Baltic consists of one old battleship, two moderncruisers and about 12 destroyers. Thirty Russian submarines may now beoperational.The port of Tallinn, formerly the base of the small Estonian navy, was used by Russian warships from 1939 to 1941 It consists of two main harbourssheltered by breakwaters and with the help of icebreakers can be kept openthroughout the year.Baltisky (28 miles west of Tallinn) was occupied on the 24th. Between 1939and 1941 it was being developed as a Russian naval base. Ships of any size cananchor in the roads, and it can be kept open throughout the year.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.General.25. The past week has been chiefly memorable for the epic stand of the1st Airborne Division at Arnhem, and the developments following upon theairborne operation launched on Sunday the 17th. The concentration of -effort on the needs of this offensive in Holland has precluded any major developmentelsewhere, but pressure has been maintained and our positions generally improvedalong the entire front. Boulogne has been captured and an all-out attack onCalais is in progress.Southern Group of Armies.26. The Allied Armies have continued to meet stiff enemy resistance at the approaches to the Belfort gap. On their left flank, however, they have succeeded in making some useful gains and reinforcing the right flank of the Third U.S.Army. In this area they eliminated the enemy salient which projected westwardsfrom Epinal almost to Chaumont and advanced to cross the Moselle in strength.Epinal itself has changed hands more than once, but it is now in our hands andadvances of some 5-6 miles have been made beyond the town.Central Group of Armies.27. This front has remained relatively static throughout the week. At thesouth end of the sector, the Third U.S. Army has made limited advances east ofNancy and has also improved its positions over the Moselle, but it has had stifffighting in resisting counter-attacks in the area w^est of Dieuze. Further norththe First U.S. Army has repelled numerous counter-attacks and has met stubbornresistance to its pressure along practically its entire front but especially in theAachen area. The enemy still holds the town of Aachen, but mopping up is continuing in the forest area S.E. of the town and also to the east where house-to-house fighting wTent on in Stolberg before it was finally captured. To the N.W.of Aachen the Maastricht appendix has been liberated.Northern Group of Armies.28. In this sector the centre of interest, has been the Arnhem area, wherethe 1st British Airborne Division fought.with unsurpassed gallantry until theywere finally withdrawn.The division was dropped near Arnhem as part of the main airborne landingson the afternoon of Sunday; the 17th, and its task in the broad strategic plan wasto secure crossings over the lower Rhine (Neder Rijn). From the beginning the division came in for very heavy fighting. On landing, one parachute brigademade its way into Arnhem and there succeeded in seizing the north end of* theimportant road bridge over the lower Rhine. The rest of the division, however,in the face of persistent enemy pressure, w7as gradually forced away from the areaof the bridge to the west of the town, where they formed a strong defensiveposition. Contact was never regained with the parachute brigade on the bridge and attempts to re-supply it were unsuccessful. Completely isolated andrepeatedly attacked by the enemy in strength, it hung on and denied the enemy the use of the bridge at Arnhem for two days.To the west of the town, the rest of the division came under heavy shellingand continuous attack from all sides, and avus compelled to reduce its perimeter.[28301] b 2 .
It resolutely hung on to those positions against the mounting scale of german attacks, and effectively prevented the Germans from using a ferry bridge and railway bridge in this area. The arrangements made for re-supplying these forces and reinforcing them by air were hampered by unfavourable weather and the strong ground defences which the enemy had deployed. Especially, the varyingfortunes of the battle made the selection of dropping zones difficult. In spite ofthese great difficulties, the Allied Air Forces made magnificent efforts to carryout re-supply and Polish and other reinforcements were flown in to the division.Meanwhile, the Second British Army made great attempts to break through and relieve the 1st British Airborne Division, but it encountered stubbornopposition and powerful enemy defences north of Nijmegen which it was unableto penetrate. Its position was further aggravated by the narrowness of the corridor, which was repeatedly cut by strong enemy tank and infantry attacksfrom the west and east. In result it proved impossible to reach the 1st AirborneDivision with reinforcements in sufficient strength and finally on the nights of25th/26th and 26th/27th September the remnants of the division, now sorelyreduced in numbers and short of food, water and ammunition, were withdrawnsouth of the lower Rhine.The cost of this gallant resistance has been heavy, but, by its valiant and self-sacrificing stand, the 1st British Airborne Division assured the success offurther operations further south. At a critical time, its resistance denied tothe enemy their shortest route for reinforcements to Nijmegen and caused a delay in their arrival which enabled us to secure intact the vitally importantbridges and a firm bridgehead over the main stream of the Rhine at Nijmegen.Further south substantial progress has been made towards^ widening the corridor and towards making it secure. On the east flank British forces are on the Maas (Meuse) at Maashees and have captured Helmond, Deurne andWeert while on the west flank other forces are on the Maas at Heerewardenand are pushing forward to Hertogenbosch.East of Antwerp, British and Canadian troops have captured Turnhoutand secured a bridgehead across the Antwerp-Turnhout Canal which they have held against enemy counter-attacks. Further to the west, Canadian and polish troops have continued to press the enemy back against the estuary of the Scheldtand the Poles have now cleared the area up to the south bank between Antwerpand Terneuzen. In the coastal sector Boulogne was finally captured on the22nd after four days of bitter fighting and some 9,000 prisoners are estimated to have been taken. An all-out attack was launched against the next fortressport of &quot;Calais on the 25th and although it has not yet fallen, good progress hasbeen made by our troops who have reached the coast and some important high ground west of the town. The attack continues. Cap Gris Nez and Dunkirkare still holding out.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)29. The last week has seen a successful conclusion of the great battle forthe enemy&apos;s Rimini defensive position. On the 21st, the Canadians cleared the vital S. Fortunato feature, and Greek troops under their command enteredRimini. Simultaneously the British corps to the south secured the Cerianoposition, and the whole front line moved forward to the line of the MarecchiaRiver, across which bridgeheads were speedily secured. By the 24th, Dominionforces operating on the coastal flank of the Canadian Corps, reached a point 4 milesup the Ravenna-Cervia road, and Gurkhas captured the town of Santarcangelo,on the Rimini-Bologna road. The latest position is that we have a bridgeheadon a wide front across the Uso River (which on some maps is identified with theRubicon), and patrols have worked forward to the line of the next water obstacle,the Fiumicini, which Mussolini has designated the Rubicon.- The Eighth Army have thus, after a month&apos;s fighting which was as stiffas anything they have ever attempted, entered a new phase of operations. It isnot expected that progress from now onwards will be easy, as the enemy is clearlydisposed to delay us in our debouching movement into the plain for as long aspossible.The Fifth Army has also made some very satisfactory progress; with the capture on the 22nd of the important junction of Firenzuola and the Futa Pass,through which the road from Florence to Bologna runs, the highest point in theApennines was reached. Very hard fighting has been necessary to achieve the objectives and the enemy resisted as strongly here as in the Adriatic sector.Since then, the advance over the mountains has continued but progress has been
limited by the difficulty of maintaining forward troops, and -getting food and supplies up to them under the conditions in which they are fighting. Never-theless, British and United States forces have made important progress up theroads leading to Forli, Faenza and Imola.On the left flank of Fifth Army small advances have been made, but activity has on the whole been on a small scale.The Russo-German Campaign.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Finland.30. It is now clear that in Central Finland the German forces are with-drawing towards the north During the past few days they have been underpressure from the Finns, who are required by the terms of the armistice to take action against any German troops remaining on Finnish soil after the 15th.Northern Sector.31. The Russians have now driven the Germans from the whole of Estonia.Driving westwards from Narva and north-westwards from Tartu, they capturedTallinn on the 22nd, and Paernu (a port on the Gulf of Riga due west of Tartu)on the following day. They are also closing in on Riga from the N.E. and east.The thrust towards Riga from the south has made no further progress duringthe week.Central- Sector.32. The Germans report unsuccessful Russian attempts to cross the Vistulanear Warsaw, but there is no confirmation of these reports from the Russians.South-west of Przemysl the Russians have gained a little ground.Balkans Sector.33. The Russians and Rumanians have captured Arad and have continued their advance westwards as far as Szeged, in Southern Hungary, where theythreaten the German L. of C. Budapest-Belgrade. If this line is cut, any Germanevacuation from the Balkans would be limited to the Belgrade-Zagreb route and a few other lines of lower capacity.Balkans.Yugoslavia.   (See inset map of Russia.)34. In central Serbia the partisans- have made considerable progress,strengthening their hold south and S.W. of Belgrade, though they are no nearer the capital itself.Banjaluka, the biggest town in Western Bosnia, has been captured after five days&apos; heavy fighting, and enemy casualties are estimated at 3,000 killed and 4,000prisoners.   A nearby airfield was also taken, complete with 30 aircraft.The German withdrawal from the islands south of Split has continued andthe partisans are virtually in control of the whole group. They also hold astretch of the coast road between Sibenik and Split.Marshal Tito left Vis on the 18th for an unknown destination.A albania.35. A British Commando and supporting arms landed about 5 miles north ofSarande on the night 22nd/23rd, and two nights later another British Commandolanded in the same area. They are both operating in the southern extremity of albania, but have so far had no engagement with the enemy, whose strength inthis area is estimated at 1,000.Greece.36. While the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force are harassing to the utmostthe enemy&apos;s departure from Crete and the /aegean Islands, guerrillas and theAllied Mission continue to attack roads and railways on the mainland.Allied parachute troops were dropped on Cape Akakos (in the N.W. of thePeloponnese) on the 23rd, with the object of seizing the airfield. They werereinforced on the following day.Patrols of the Allied force which landed on Kithera last week are now operating on the mainland of the Peloponnese and on the island of Antikithera.
They have also reported that two islands off the east coast of the Peloponnesus areclear of the enemy.British officers report that EAM has established complete order in Chios andMytilene.Burma.37. The leading elements of our troops advancing down the Imphai-Tiddirnroad are only 7 miles north of Tiddim. having covered a distance of 15 road milesduring the past week. Further slight progress has been made by forces advancingdown the Kabaw Valley, although movement has been slowed on account of bad weather.   They are now7 26 miles south of Htinzin.China.38. The Japanese advance down the Hengyang-Kweilin railway has reached a point some 50 miles from Kweilin. In their drive westwards fromCanton they have reached and occupied Wuchow, while a simultaneous northwardthrust from the Kwangchowwan area is directed at the West river 50 miles aboveWuchow.Pacific Theatre.    (An outline map showing area of Japanese occupation is included as an inset.)Halmaheras.39. U.S. troops have made two further landings on Morotai withoutencountering enemy opposition. Enemy resistance on this island is virtually atan end.Pal an Islands.40. Progress on Peleliu has been good. The remnants of the Japanesedefenders are isolated in two areas the northernmost tip of the island and thearea of the Umurbrogol Mountain. Nearly 8,000 Japanese have been killed onPeleliu.Resistance on Anguar came to an end on the 20th. 850 Japanese were killedon this island.AIR SITUATION.General Review.41 Heavy bombers delivered &quot;softening&quot; attacks on Calais and the strategical bombing of German war industry was intensified. In general,offensive activity on the western battle front was reduced by poor weather; supplies and reinforcements were flown to the battle areas in Holland.Heavy attacks were made on enemy communications in Italy. In Hungary,heavy bombers attacked rail targets and in Greece, harbour installations.United Kingdom.42. Flying-bombs were again launched against this country. Two enemy aircraft, possibly concerned with this weapon, were destroyed off Holland.Home Waters.43. Aircraft of Coastal Command flew 687 sorties involving 6,086 flying-hours; five aircraft are missing and one crashed in this country.No ships are claimed to have been sunk; in numerous instances bad visibilityinterfered with observation. Each of the following, however, received a numberof hits and some were left burning : (a) Off the Norwegian coast a 1,500-ton ship, a 1,000-ton ship, four escort vessels and a minesweeper; (b) off the dutch coast a large ship, three trawler type auxiliaries and a minesweeper. Duringoperations against a large convoy off Den Helder, land targets were attacked with good effect.Western Front.44. During the week ended dusk on the 26th, aircraft of the A.E.A.F.(44 of which are missing) flew 8,065 sorties; 775 tons of bombs were released and 47 enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat while a further 12 were probably
gdestroyed and 17 damaged. Aircraft of Bomber Command and-the VIII U.S.Commands flew 12,780 sorties during the week ended dawn on the 28th; over25,000 tons of bombs were dropped; 155 Allied aircraft did not return and121 enemy aircraft were destroyed. (Note. The foregoing figures areprovisional, as complete returns have not&quot; yet been received.)Activity by enemy fighters showed an appreciable change from previousweeks. Some of our large-scale attacks by heavy bombers against targets inGermany and on Calais continued to provoke no opposition. In contrast, therewas vigorous reaction over Holland and the Siegfried Line, even in bad weather and, on certain days, totals of 350 fighters were operating : in the ensuing engage-nients, the casualties inflicted on the enemy were about 75 per cent, heavier than our losses.France and the Low Countries.45. Immediately prior to the capitulation of Boulogne, strong-points were again bombed (95 tons). Operations were then transferred to Calais, where specificaiming points within a restricted radius were attacked on four occasions;4,285 tons of bombs were dropped on concrete defence positions but, thoughbombing was &quot;concentrated, results were difficult to assess due to demolitions andflooding. Heavy coastal guns at Domburg, on the island of Walcheren, were attacked by heavy bombers (175 tons).The Battle Front.46. Tactical bombing of railway centres at Osnabrtick and Hamm (810 and735 tons respectively) and the delivery of supplies, reinforcements and equipmentwere the main events of a week in which weather was unfavourable, particularly on the first two clays when visibility was extremely poor. Despite theseconditions, the dropping of supplies and troops was maintained every day andon several nights; 81 aircraft were lost. A total (provisional) of 620 aircraft was engaged on these missions in the Eindhoven/Arnhem area; Belgium baseswere used in some instances. In addition, 1,351 sorties were flown on similarmissions to France and Belgium and 715 Liberators delivered a considerable quantity of fuel.Close support was provided in the Arnhem area, where German infantry,mortar positions and a H.Q. were attacked and 135 tons dropped on Flak sites.Approximately 2,500 sorties were flown on armed reconnaissances and patrols;100 tons of bombs were released on strong points at Breskens, north-west ofTerneuzen on the lower Schelde, and 150 tons on road and rail junctions at Cleveand, nearby, Goch. Rocket-firing aircraft rendered effective assistance indisrupting the threat to our L. of C. in Holland. In the course of these operations,28 locomotives and about 200 railroad trucks were destroyed as well as a numberof M.T. vehicles and some tanks.Germany.47. A considerable tonnage of bombs was dropped in a series of operations against transportation targets, which included the inland port and railway centre at Heuss, near Dusseldorf (2,660 tons), marshalling yards at Frankfurt (990 tons),Coblenz (935 tons), Ludwigshafen (505 tons) and Mainz (360 tons), and theaqueduct and town of Minister (890 tons). Synthetic oil plants were again targets for heavy bombers; the main attacks were made on plants at Ludwigshafen(875 tons in two attacks) and Sterkrade (945 tons). Nearly 1,000 tons of bombs were released on an air components factory at Bremen and there were heavy attacks on the industrial cities of Cassel (1,520 tons), Karlsruhe (940 tons) andKaiserlautern (950 tons, of which 860 tons were I.B.). A number of bombers wasprevented by bad weather from locating their primary objectives; about 4,000tons were dropped on alternative targets.Mosquitoes made attacks on Bochum, Mannheim, Frankfurt and Cassel(60 tons in each instance), while smaller raids were carried out on other targets.Mediterranean Front. .,48. During the week ended the 26th, aircraft of the M.A.A.F.&quot;flew a totalof 8,703 sorties, of which 2,477 (14 missing) were by heavy bombers; 7;225 tonsof bombs were dropped. A total of 54 Allied aircraft are missing; three enemy aircraft were shot down and 50 destroyed on the ground.The primary objectives for the strategic bombers were railway targets in hungary; airfields and harbour installations in Greece also received attention.Throughout the week, enemy opposition was negligible.
Italy.49. The Tactical Air Force continued effectively to attack road and railway communications, and to provide close support for the army. Numerous attacks, inmost instances carried out by medium bombers, were made on bridges, with very satisfactory results, ten railway bridges across the River Po receiving direct hitson the 22nd and eight spans being destroyed on the 26th. On the 23rd, Mitchellsattacked and set on fire the ex-Italian cruiser Taranto in Spezia harbour. Therailway centre at Treviso provided the target for over 250 fighter-bombers on the23rd and those at Forli and Cesena on the 24th. Over 200 strategic bomberssuccessfully attacked railway and road bridges near Venice and Udine (470 tons).Aircraft from the Coastal Air Force harassed shipping in the Adriatic,destroying two vessels and damaging three others.South Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.50. On the 22nd, Liberators dropped 810 tons on an airfield and other targets in the Munich area. In Hungary, the railway system centred on Budapestreceived 1,600 tons from about 700 heavies and 116 tons were dropped on a junction17 miles south of B2-atislava. A successful attack was carried out by Liberatorson the railway bridge at Novi Sad (45 miles north-west of Belgrade).Targets in Czechoslovakia included Bratislava oil installations (121 tons),the synthetic oil refinery at Brux (45 miles N.W. of Prague, 335 tons), and the airfield at Malacky (35 miles N.E. of Venice, 221 tons).South-Eastern Europe.51. In Greece, the port facilities at Salonika were successfully attacked by71 heavies; 127 tons were also dropped on the railway centre at Salonika West.On the 22nd, a heavy concentration was achieved on the railway centre at Larissa.In the course of other attacks excellent results were reported on three airfieldsnear Athens, where at least 20 aircraft were destroyed on the ground, and onthe harbour installations in the Piraeus area where considerable damage was caused, including one 500-ton U-boat and two other vessels sunk.The Balkan Air Force raided Larissa airfield, destroying three Ju. 52 onthe ground, while, south of Phlorina, Spitfires attacked an M.T. park containing200 vehicles, all of which were destroyed.Attacks on communications and military targets in Yugoslavia and off the dalmatian coast were continued. A total of 469 sorties was flown for the lossof 11 aircraft.Aircraft from the Middle East Command operated during the week overthe iEgean Islands and Crete.
