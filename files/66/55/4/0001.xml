THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECRET.Copy of a letter, dated 2nd September, 1944, from M. Mikolajczyk to thePrime Minister.Republic of PolandPrime Minister.Accept my heartfelt thanks for your message to the Polish Nation and thewords of encouragement which I received from you yesterday.I beg to submit to you, my dear Prime Minister, the messages from Polandreceived to-day and, reverting to the request made yesterday both on behalf ofthe Polish people and myself. I once more appeal to you for your decision tobring help to Warsaw by one large-scale operation of the R.A.F.I am convinced that you, my dear Prime Minister, who never shirked boldenterprises and whose courage is unbounded, will take the decision which will saveWarsaw and her defenders.*      *      *S. MIKOLAJCZYK.Enclosure No. 1.Message from Warsaw, dated 31st August, 1944; Received 2nd September, 1944.To the Prime Minister : &quot; In spite of the recognition of the Home Army as a belligerent army andin spite of the public statement concerning the refusal of help by the U.S.S.R.,Warsaw has not received aid from the Allies.&apos;&apos; What does the Government propose to do in view of this and what arewe to do after a month of fighting without aid ? &apos;&apos;The Government&apos;s Delegate.The Chairman of the Council of National Unity.The 0.C, the Home Army.Enclosure No. 2.Message from Warsaw, dated 1st September, 1944; Received 2nd September, 1944.&quot; The rising in the Old Town is nearing its tragic end. The Home Armywithdraws from the Old Town. Germans complete the burning down of houses inthe following streets : Panska, Sliska, Sienna, Zlota, and the sector of Chmielnabetween Zelazna and Marszalkowska. Next will be burnt the quarter roundNapoleon&apos;s Square and Powisle, which are continuously bombed from the air.We cannot fight the fires any longer because of lack of water and anti-fire equip-ment. The Germans are compressing us more and more. If within a few days note a few days the German concentrations at least are not bombed, the morale of the civil population will collapse.   Consequences will be incalculable.&quot;Enclosure No. 3.Message from Warsaw, dated 20th August, 1944; Received 2nd September, 1944.To the Prime Minister for transmission to Prime Minister Churchill: (This message is also addressed to the Speaker of the House ofCommons, the Executive of the Labour Party, and in America to president roosevelt and the American Congress, and finally to the International red cross.)&quot; In the name of the Council of National Unity, representing whole fighting-Poland, I ardently appeal for immediate and effective help in arms, food, and[28158]
medical supplies. I address this request, which we have repeated day by day during the four weeks of fighting in Warsaw, in the conviction that the capital of Poland will at last see the fulfilment of the promises given by the governments and Peoples of the Allied Nations, and in particular by the English-speakingNations. The further incomprehensible isolation of fighting Warsaw and par-tieularly further delay in granting by the Allies of belligerents&apos; rights to theHome Army must end without delay. Warsaw, dripping with blood, has faith inthe conscience of the world and in the common fight for freedom, and expects fromthe Allies the fulfilment of their obligation of immediate rescue.&quot;Chairman of the Council of National Unity.Enclosure No. 4.Broadcast by the Polish Prime Minister to Warsaw on the 1st September, 1944.Heroes of Warsaw 1There are moments in the lives of nations when phraseology must be putaside, when any mention of one&apos;s duties, merits or ideals or the paying of homageby mere words, is not betimes.I know that when I am addressing; men standing in the face of death, whohave either to endure and win or perish, I must use the most simple words.I know that you have confidence in me even in the throes of a deadly battle,when in spite of a feeling of deception and injustice done to Warsaw, you gave byan unanimous vote of the Polish Underground Parliament the Council ofNational Unity sanction to my proposals for a settlement of Polish-soviet relations, by doing so testifying of your political maturity, which is accompanyingyour sacrifices, heroism and struggles.You may be sure that the Polish Government will not capitulate and resignthe rights of Poland to full independence, freedom and sovereignty. I declarethis in the full realisation of the gravity of this tragic situation.As Premier of the Polish Government I take full co-responsibility for thedecisions passed by your political and military leaders the Deputy Premier, theministers of the Polish Government acting in the Homeland, General Bor and theCouncil of National Unity.Having the ground to do so, you stood up in right time to wage an open fight against the Germans for the sake of independence and freedom and to protect thepopulation.You did as since March 1944 did your brethren everywhere east of Warsawand as they are still continuing to do, helping at the same time the heroic andvictorious Soviet armies in their fight with the enemy.The fate of war had decreed&apos; that the liberation of Warsaw had not takenplace as soon as was rightly expected by all.The fight is still continuing. You are fighting, for fight you must and fightyou will. You have no other issue and each doubt or breakdown will mean deathinstead of victory.You have the right and wish to endure to win and live.You have the right to assistance. No one may, out of opportunistic or political reasons, diminish the value of your efforts undertaken with the purestof intentions.You did not get help due to you in spite of all the devotion of the British,South African and Polish airmen. Lately the latter were the only ones whohelped you.We do all we can to make you get the help in an adequate measure and intime. I have not lost hope that it will be done. When help is to be given I willwarn you of it.I avail myself of this opportunity to address once again in publicMarshal Stalin, President Roosevelt and Premier Churchill.Leaders of Great Powers, Commanders of the powerful and victorious land and air armies!Warsaw is waiting, the whole Polish nation is waiting, the opinion of theworld is waiting. Do all you can to provide means for fm-ther fighting and to liberate this city and the population fighting on its ruins, drenched with blood.They are fighting and spilling their blood, but they arduously wish to livefor Poland.
Heroes of Warsaw! Beside all the crimes perpetrated upon the civilian population, the German wish to demoralise and unstring you by threatening toburn Warsaw.Those who are murdering you pretend by spreading false information to turn into your defenders.I wish to declare, with a full feeling of responsibility, that, for burningthe remnants of Warsaw, should they ever dare to do it, for murdering the civilian population and the Home Army, protected by combatants&apos; rights, weshall hold them to account.We promise and we shall hold our word if the mortally wounded beast willdare to carry out its threat.I take leave from you in the conviction that you will endure until help andliberation comes to you, that you will have your share in the victory of the alliedworld.We shall rebuild our cities and villages in a free and independent Poland,and we shall do all to prevent the German beast to menace the world by new acts of brigandage.Enclosure No. 5.Broadcast by &quot; Radio Pqlskie,&quot; Warsaw, on 2nd September, 1944, at 10-35 am.Tl Warsaw is waiting. We received yesterday Prime Minister Mikolajczyk&apos;message in a soldierly spirit. We did not have and have no choice. The soldiersof Wola, MokotoAv, the Inner City and Powisle. are faithful soldiers. We believe in the cause of our struggle and therefore we shall go on fighting to the last dropof our blood .... The democratic world looks on whilst thousands of old people,women and children are perishing.   Warsaw is waiting for help.&quot;Enclosure No. 6Message from Warsaw, dated 1st September, 1944; Received 2nd September, 1944.In other parts of the City the Germans are continuing their periodical air,artillery and mine-thrower attacks. There are two kinds of mines in use one is composed of half explosive and half incendiary material, while the other isof pure explosive material. The list of casualties mounts daily. It is impossibleto calculate as yet how high the losses of human life are. Thousands of people have been taken out from the city by the Germans, thousands more are cut off from any communication with the parts of the town occupied by the Home Army,and thousands more are buried under the ruins of houses. In the largeconcentration camps in the German hands .... are murdered.J. WARD.
