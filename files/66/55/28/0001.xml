THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  September 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 528.ISth September, 1944.......PROLONGATION OF PARLIAMENT.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. The Prolongation of Parliament Act, 1943, is due to expire on the25th November next. Accordingly a Bill, further prolonging Parliament, will need, to be passed before that date. While there can be no doubt of the need forsuch a measure, objections may be raised if Parliament is prolonged by that Billfor a further year. It might be argued that, now that the end of the German waris in sight, it would be reasonable for the House of Commons to exercise a constantcontrol over the need for the continuation of this Parliament, and that this could best be effected by a Bill prolonging Parliament say for 6 months, any furtherprolongation requiring a subsequent Bill.In my opinion this course does not possess any real merits. The continuation of the life of Parliament for a further year does not preclude a dissolution atany time, nor does it prevent the Government being voted out of office wereParliament so minded. On the other hand, if Parliament is to be prolongedonly for 6 months, there would appear in present circumstances to be everylikelihood of a further Bill being required in the Spring. This would addunnecessarily to the congestion in a crowded Parliamentary session withoutappearing to possess any compensating advantages.2. It is also necessary by the Bill further to empower the House of commons of Northern Ireland to prolong its life, and it would seem reasonable that this extension should also be for a year.3: I accordingly ask for authority to proceed with the Bill for these twopurposes.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1,19th September, 1944.Copy No.[28250]
