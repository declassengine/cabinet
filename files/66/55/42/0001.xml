THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  September 1944./SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 542.24^/i September, 1944.WAR CABINET.ARMISTICE WITH FINLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will have seen the telegraphic correspondence with HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Moscow leading up to the conclusion of the armistice with Finland. But it may be convenient that I should make some commentsupon it.2. The armistice was signed on behalf of all the United Nations at warwith Finland. i.e., besides the Soviet Union and this country, the Dominions and czechoslovakia.  The terms were communicated to the United States Government.3. The main terms are, in most respects, those which were published and generally hailed as moderate when.they were rejected by the Finns at an earlier stage. The conditions which were put to the Finns for acceptance beforenegotiations in Moscow could be opened were also published at the time, viz., therupture of relations with Germany and a provision that, if the Germans didnot comply with a demand that they should withdraw all their arme,d forces from Finland by the 15th September, they should be disarmed and handed overto the Allies. Before negotiations had opened in Moscow, the Finns had received an assurance of Russian help in expelling the German forces from NorthernFinland.4. The Russians complicated matters by proposing to sign an immediatepeace treaty. We pointed out that this was impossible and discussed with theRussians the possibility instead of embodying some of the long-term provisions in an agreement for preliminaries of peace. But in the end the Russians decidedafter all to conclude a single armistice agreement. The final peace treaty withFinland remains, therefore, to be concluded later. But the full extent of Russia&apos;main demands on Finland are now fixed and known. This is, I consider, all tothe good. Although they are not light, apprehensions fairly widely entertainedin Scandinavia and elsewhere, such as that Finland would cease to exist as anindependent nation, that under the heading of reparations practically the wholeof Finnish man-power and economy might be conscripted for rehabilitation workin devastated Soviet territory, &amp;c, are disposed of. The indemnity to be paidby Finland is, indeed, much lighter than that included in the earlier publisheddemands; the amount has been reduced by half to 300 million dollars, and theperiod of payment has been extended by one year to six years. (This reduction is no doubt clue to the view expressed by us earlier that the original Russian claim was very heavy and would seriously affect our prospects of getting importantimports from there.)5. As regards the territorial settlement, this, save in one respect, followsthe terms rejected by Finland earlier and accepted as moderate by world opinionat that time, viz., a return to the position under the 1940 treaty of peace betweenFinland and Russia and the cession of the Petsamo district. The addition isthat Finland leases to Russia for fifty years territory at Porkkala-Ud on the south coast of Finland for a naval base in lieu of the thirty-year lease of Hango, whichthe Russians held under the 1940 peace treaty and which the Finns were most anxious to see terminated. My colleagues may have seen Stockholm telegram12524   [28280]2o o
Xo. 1085 of the 18th September, reporting that the Secretary-General of theSwedish Foreign Office is deeply depressed about this condition. I think his view is exaggerated. It is true that the area at Porkkala-Ud is larger than theHangd leased area and that it runs to within 10 miles of Helsinki. But Helsinkiwould be just as much under a permanent threat from Russian bombers were there no base at Porkkala-Ud. The area is not commercially important, whereasHangd was a very useful port and was also said to have considerable sentimentalimportance. The Chiefs of Staff saw no objection to the establishment of theSoviet base at Porkkala-Ud and the Russians insisted that, for military reasons,it was essential to them. The Russians (and we as their Allies) have sufferedgreatly since 19-11 through the complete blocking of their Baltic fleet in theGulf of Finland and it seemed to me extremely difficult in these circumstances to contest the Russian demand to safeguard themselves against Germany being able to repeat the process. Certainly, to have done so would have made the worstpossible impression on the Russians.6. With the cession of Petsamo, the interests of the International NickelCompany of Canada in the Petsamo nickel mines (through their British sub-sidiary the Mond Nickel Company) will be taken over by the Soviet State, sinceof course no foreign company is allowed to operate in the Soviet Union. TheSoviet Government, after suggesting that we should seek compensation from the finns, have, I am glad to say, accepted the obligation to compensate the Britishinterests involved and have offered a maximum of 20 million dollars. We arein touch with the Canadian Government, who have informed us that, althoughthe International Nickel Company put their claim at 50 million dollars, theyare prepared to accept 20 million dollars. We are discussing with the canadian government the further handling of this matter. My own vieAv is that we shouldbe ill-advised not to accept the Soviet offer immediately and so avoid the possiblerisk tint it would be withdrawn or that we should get into a difficult discussionwith the Soviet Government in which they would ask for the company!s claimto be substantiated in detail. I understand the Treasury view to be that thecompany are founding their claim on an abnormal basis, since they appear tobe including a very large amount in respect of prospective profits from thenickel mines. The actual amount of capital invested in the mines is only inthe region of 6^- million dollars.7. The other articles of the armistice require no special comment, I think.They are broadly on similar lines to the corresponding articles of the Roumanianarmistice, except that the Finns are not required to declare war on Germanynor to use their army against Germany. In fact, there is no question of the finns being co-belligerent like the Roumanians.A. E.Foreign Office, 24th September, 1944.
