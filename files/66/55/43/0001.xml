THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET.copy No.    OUW.P. (44) 543.&apos;22nd September, 1944.WAR CABINET.FINANCE OF RELIEF IN THE MILITARY PERIOD.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THIS problem was set out fully by the Minister of State in W.P. (44) 459of the 19th August.At their meeting on the 29th August (W.M. (44) 112th Conclusions, Minute 1)the War Cabinet asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer to report further inthe light of the discussion on the United States proposal for sharing the cost of relief in the military period. In execution of this decision, the Chancellorof the Exchequer, after consultation with the Minister of State, submitted tothe War Cabinet a draft telegram to Washington (W.P. (44) 486) which was approved on the 5th September (Conclusions 117 (44), Minute 2).The outcome of the negotiation conducted by the Minister of State is contained in Montreal telegrams Nos. 10 and 11, upon Avhich an urgent decision is necessary..The main points at issue are as follows : We are engaged in combined military operations with the Americans, andthe relief of the civil population in the area of these operations is a recognisedmilitary necessity accepted by both parties. The supplies for this relief form part of the operational requirements put forward by the Combined Chiefs ofIn certain areas of operation [e.g., France, Belgium and Holland) the costof these supplies during the military period will be borne by the Governments ofthe territories in question In other&apos;areas (e.g., Italy. Greece and Yugoslavia) thecost will; in effect, be irrecoverable.We had hoped at one time to be able to charge our share of these irrecoverablecosts to our contribution to U.N.R.R.A. This has not proved to be possible, andother means of financing this expenditure had to be devised. At one time the americans suggested an equal division of these costs with them.* We counteredby suggesting that the costs should be divided in the same proportions as our respective contributions to U.N.R.R.A. This would have meant that the UnitedStates would bear a share roughly four times greater than that of the UnitedKingdom. This solution was not accepted by the Americans, but they eventuallymade a tentative proposal which would have resulted, as far as accurateestimates&quot;can at present be made, in their bearing 64 per cent, of the costs, theUnited Kingdom bearing 28 per cent, and Canada bearing 8 per cent.The War, Cabinet agreed to a solution on.these lines on condition, inter alia.that an attempt should be made to secure better terms, which were suggested as70 per cent, for the United States and 30 per cent, for the United Kingdom and canada (W.P. (44) 486).In the event, the United States now appear disposed to accept a percentageof 67 per cent, for themselves, leaving 25 percent, for the United Kingdom and per cent, for Canada (Montreal telegram No. 10, Relief). This seems a satis-factory outcome of a very difficult negotiation.These percentages were to apply to such part of the outlay and relief supplies in the military period up to $1,000 million as was not recovered from the recipient countries. But the War Cabinet decided that if the net loss seemedto be approaching $200 million (the United Kingdom share of which would be12525   [28279]Staff.
25 per cent.. i.e.,  50 million or  12^ million) the situation would have to be reviewed afresh between the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom(W.P. (44) 486).It is this figure of  12-i million on which the negotiations now hinge. TheUnited States point out&quot; that expenditure already incurred on relief in themilitary period in Italy alone amounts to 8150 million, which is at presentirrecoverable, and consequently the proposed review of the whole situation wouldhave to take place almost immediately after the initial agreement,had beenreached. They therefore suggest that the figure at which the review shouldtake place should be raised from S200 million to 8450 million (25 per cent, ofwhich would be 8112-5 million or roughly  28-i- million) so that the limit weimpose should be one which will enable provision for relief supplies to go forward for at least six months before the position needs to be reconsidered. There willbe serious procurement difficulties if the method of financing supplies is not clearly laid down for at least six months ahead.As w;is explained at the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 22nd September(W.IvI. (44) 125th Conclusions. Minute 5). the Chancellor of the Exchequerthought that this was as favourable a settlement as we were likely to secure, and asked that authority should be given to the Minister of State accordingly. Thisview is fully shared by the Eoreign Office.Two objections were raised (a) that the additional expenditure would constitute a very heavy burden on the people of this country in view of our financial position;(b) that a very considerable proportion of the expenditure might be spent in Italy.As to (a) this expenditure seems inescapable. While combined operationscontinue, and supplies for the civil population are considered as necessary to thoseoperations, the United Kingdom is called upon to bear a share. What we seek todo is to limit that share as much as possible. These supplies have to be providedwherever operations are conducted. In some areas we can recover the costs. in others we cannot, but the supplies in this last case have to be provided just thesame, as they are the minimum which the military think necessary to preventdisease and unrest prejudicial to military operations. All that we can do is toendeavour to arrange a financial settlement as favourable as possible in the lightof the sources from which the supplies are drawn by the decisions of the combined boards as to availabilities.As to (b) this also seems inescapable. Active operations have been inprogress for many months in Italy and while they continue expenditure on relief supplies is inevitable, though of course from the financial point of view it isunfortunate that the operations are in enemy country from which we cannot atpresent recover the costs.The scale of these supplies is a quite distinct question, and it is being dealtwith separately. What we are concerned with now is the minimum amount ofsupplies necessary to prevent disease and unrest for military and not humanitarian-tarian reasons. If we raise the scale of relief above this standard forhumanitarian, political, or other reasons, it will involve further expenditure.Unless the United States are prepared to pay the total cost of these additional supplies (which, as Italy is an area of combined military responsibility, seems unlikely) the  28-1 million now under discussion will obviously not last so long.But the question of the scale of relief to Italy is not the question now requiringdecision. What is required is a decision to enable procurement to continue ona minimum basis necessary to prevent disease and unrest.The suggestion has been made that we should earmark a part of this 28^ million for Greece and Yugoslavia. To earmark a part of this sum definitelyfor these two countries is impracticable. The expenditure has to be incurredwherever operations take place. If operations start immediately in Greece orYugoslavia, expenditure will be incurred in respect of these operations simul-taneously with the expenditure in Italy, but in varying degrees. If the operations in Italy are on a larger scale than those undertaken in Greece and Yugoslavia,which seems likely, the expenditure in Italy will inevitably be greater.The expenditure in Greece and Yugoslavia will, however, automaticallydiminish once the military authorities are prepared to allow U.N.R.R.A. to operate in those countries. Every effort is being made to ensure that U.N.R.R.A.will be allowed to operate in those countries as soon as possible after the militaryhave entered them.
As regards the operation of U.N.R.R.A. in Italy, a proposal is at present being discussed at Montreal that U.N.R.R.A. should be allowed to operate forcertain limited purposes in that country up to a total amount of $50 million. Tothe extent that U.N.R.R.A. is allowed so to operate, the pressure upon the militaryauthorities in Italy to increase the standard of relief above that of the preventionof disease and unrest will be diminished pro tanto. But for U.N.R.R.A. to beable to operate in enemy territories, a formal resolution of the forty-four nations who are parties to the U.N.R.R.A. Agreement is necessary. The Allies, who might feel that enemies were receiving preferential treatment, have thereforeample opportunities of stating their case before a final decision is taken. If theUnited States and the United Kingdom, either jointly or separately, decide togive preferential treatment to Italy, it does not commit U.X.R.R.A., and suchpreferential treatment may well have to be financed outside the U.N.R.R.A.arrangements.With the foregoing explanations, I trust it will be possible for my colleagues to agree that the Minister of State should be granted the authority he seeks to conclude these negotiations on the terms he suggests. These terms seem to be.both to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself, as favourable as we can inpresent circumstances hope to secure.I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will see their way clear to grant thenecessary authority to the Minister of State without further delay.Foreign Office, 22nd September, 1944.
