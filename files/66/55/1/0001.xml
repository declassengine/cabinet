It is issued for the personal use of7TOP SECRET.copy No.W.P. (44) 501.Qth September, 1944.WAR CABINET.FUTURE POLICY FOR &quot; CROSSBOW &quot; COUNTER-MEASURES.1. We have been reviewing the effect of the military developments on theContinent on the various offensive and defensive counter-measures against&quot; Crossbow.&quot;2. All those areas from which either the flying-bomb or the rocket mightbe launched against London have been, or are about to be, occupied by allied troops. There should thus shortly be no further danger to this country from either of these causes, except for the possibility of the airborne launching of lying-bombs. Our Intelligence Staff consider it likely that these launchings maycontinue for a short period, but on a dwindling scale as the German bomber basesare forced farther East. The potential scale of attack by this method is small.In these circumstances, we propose the following action : (a) Bombing attacks against &quot;Crossbow&quot; targets should be discontinued.Should the enemy launch effective rocket attacks against any target of importance other than London, these counter-measures could be started again at short notice. Bombing attacks against the flyingbomb organisation would be limited to action against airfields fromwhich airborne launchings are known, or suspected, to be taking place.These would in any case form part of our normal air offensive againstthe German Air Force.(b) No drastic change in our defensive organisation should be made for aweek or so, since it is just possible that the enemy might succeed infiring off a few more flying-bombs before the Pas de Calais is completely overrun.(c) The radio counter-measures against the rocket should be reviewed bythe Air Ministry. There is rather a remote possibility of rocketattacks against targets on the continent, and on this ground, and because of the necessity for further experimental development,precipitate steps to cease radio counter-measures should not be taken.(d) The priorities accorded to the production of special equipment for defence against &quot; Crossbow &quot; should be reviewed, and the productionof such equipment not required for experimental development shouldbe closed down.(e) The   appropriate   authorities   should   examine   the   present   anti-Crossbow &apos;&apos; defences with a view to making proposals for theirreduction and redisposition in the light of the changed situation.3. In anticipation of the approval of the War Cabinet to the above measureswe are initiating the necessary action.Report by the Vice-Chiefs of Staff.(Signed)A. E. NYE.D. C. S. EVILL.E. N.
