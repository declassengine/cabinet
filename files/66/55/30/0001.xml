THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY of HIS britannic majesty&apos;3 governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.  September 1944SECRET.W.P. (44) 530.10th September, 1944.WAR CABINET.INTERNATIONAL AIR CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.AS my colleagues will be aware, the United States Government has issuedinvitations for an International Conference on Civil Air Transport to be heldin Washington, beginning on the 1st November.2. At the Anglo-American discussions in London last April it was agreedthat we and the Americans should go forward to a full International conference as soon as possible. The Americans then held bilateral talks with various othercountries, including members of the British Commonwealth. These talksapparently convinced the Americans that the British plan, which does not suittheir commercial ambitions, commanded a good deal of support. The planprovides for the orderly development of post-war civil air transport under thecontrol of an International Authority with executive powers. So the Americansdropped the idea of convening an International Conference and announcedinstead that they intended to open bilateral negotiations for the widespread grantof operating rights to American civil airlines without further delay. The factthat they have now summoned an International Conference justifies the firm line we took when we first heard of their changed intentions.3. The Americans have not yet issued a formal agenda for the Conference.They have, however, published a full statement, which includes a list of objectives.4. It is clear from this statement that the Americans still hope that bydealing in the first instance with interim operating rights they will be able toavoid discussion of the proposal put forward by the United Kingdom and endorsed by the Commonwealth countries for the establishment of an international authority with executive powers. Having obtained the operating rights they need, they would no doubt argue, at the end of hostilities, that the interim arrangements were quite adequate and that nothing more was required.5. In these circumstances it is, in my view, essential, first, that in accepting the American invitation to the Conference we should make it clear where west and and, secondly, that our comments should be in the hands of the Americansbefore the agenda for the Conference is issued. Accordingly, I recommend thatin accepting the American invitation we should make the following points whichhave been agreed interdepartmentally :  (a) That we remain of the view that it should be the first objective in any discussions on international co-operation to establish as soon aspossible an International Authority with effective powers to regulateboth the technical and economic aspects of post-war international air transport;(b) that, as a corollary, any arrangements made to cover the period untilthe end of hostilities should be on a purely temporary basis pendingthe conclusion of a long-term international agreement: and that such temporary facilities as are granted should be on a reciprocal basis and subject to agreement on (i) the allocation of routes, (ii) frequencies,and (iii) rates of carriage; and(c) that we are no longer able to resist the pressure for a statement of thepolicy we advocate for the future development of international air transport and that we accordingly propose to present a White paper to Parliament when it reassembles outlining the policy favoured byHis Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.f28249]
6. I attach particular importance to (c). We have for sound reasonsrefrained up till now from publishing our plan for the post-war organisation ofinternational air transport, despite the fact that Canada published her DraftConvention, incorporating the main features of our proposals, some time ago andthat there have been serious leakages. The time has now come when parliament and the British public, to say nothing of our friends abroad, have a right to know what our policy is.7.   I ask my colleagues to endorse the line of reply outlined above.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry,19th September, 1944.
