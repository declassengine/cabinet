JOHN CURTIN, M.P.,PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA.1. Introduction.The purpose of the Conference.The Conference held in London in May last was convened for a personalexchange of views between Prime Ministers, and not for the purpose of taking decisions on the extensive and varied field of important subjects which were discussed.These broadly fell into two main groups : (i) The conduct of the war in which the measures necessary for the defeat, of Germany and Japan were considered, in order that the Governmentof each part of the British Commonwealth could review its war effort in relation to the strategic plans,(ii) Post-war problems of an Empire or international nature.The discussions also included questions of procedure on future courses of action.Other Purposes of the Visit.My visit to the United Kingdom, United States and Canada also enabled meto convey to the Heads of the Governments and the people of those countries a message from the people of Australia, expressing our admiration of their warefforts and sacrifices, and our deep gratitude for the aid which has been extendedto us in our struggle in this part of the world.[28090] b
The dimensions of the war effort of the British people, and the degree ofsuccess achieved, is one of the marvels of the war. They have thwarted an invasion by a great and powerful continental foe. At the risk of their local defence they have conducted campaigns overseas and are at present engaged inthe greatest one of all. They have maintained command of the sea over a large part of the globe, and reduced the submarine menace. They have conducted an air offensive in Europe. They have produced immense quantities of munitions and supplies, not only for their own requirements, but for other members of theUnited Nations as well. To achieve all this, the British people have cheerfullyaccommodated themselves to a high degree of austerity in their living conditions.I am sure we have the greatest sympathy with them in the new perils from theair that they have been called upon to endure. It is a gambler&apos;s final throw toencourage the German people at the eleventh hour, and is an attempt to create a diversion of Allied air strength from the fighting front because of the enemy&apos;sgreat inferiority in air power.My primary duty in the United States was to express to the Governmentand people of that country the profound gratitude of the Australian people forthe assistance that we have received. I also spoke of our great pride in thecomradeship of arms of our joint Forces in the South-West Pacific Area, andof our admiration of the magnificent victories won by the American Forces inother areas in the Pacific and in the African and European theatres. The war effort of the United States is an amazing tribute to the resources of that country.It has millions of men under arms and is doing a vast war-production programme.Notwithstanding these demands on its man-power and material resources, theUnited States has been able to maintain its standard of civilian consumption atan extraordinarily high level.In Canada, I conveyed to the Government and people the thanks of australia for assistance that has been given under the Mutual Aid Agreement, and for thegreat hospitality that has been extended to Australian airmen, whose exemplaryconduct and manly bearing have won for them the warm friendship of theCanadian people.I was also able to visit some of our Air Squadrons in the United Kingdomand to express to them the pride of the Australian people in the part they areplaying in the war in Europe.2. The War against Germany.In December 1941 Mr. Churchill and President Roosevelt made themomentous decision in global strategy for the defeat of Germany first.The marshalling of the strength of the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates to strike a decisive blow in Western Europe, in conjunction with theRussian advance from the East and the assault in Italy has been a prolonged and prodigious task.In the meantime, it has been necessary to overcome the submarine menace,to destroy or neutralise the main units of the German surface fleet, and to eliminate the Italian Navy. Command of the sea has been vital to sustain thewar effort of Britain and to enable the man-power and material strength of theUnited States to be brought into the line of battle in the European theatre.It has also been essential to establish air supremacy over the enemy and,at the same time, reduce his war productive capacity, and damage and disrupthis transport system.During this lengthy period of preparation for the offensive in Europe, itwas necessary to maintain the ring around Germany by the operations in theMiddle East. The unfolding of the Allied plans commenced in the offensive in North Africa. It has continued with the advance through Sicily and Italy,where it has been greatly to our advantage to fight and destroy the german armies there, rather than receive a walk-over, because of their withdrawal tothe Eastern or Western front.The great decision taken at the Tehran Conference was to launch the attackon Western Europe. During the Conference in London, we were acquainted with the gigantic preparations which had been made, and one could not fail tobe impressed with the almost intolerable burden imposed on Mr. Churchill, theother leaders of the United Nations, and the Commanders, by the momentousimportance of the success or failure to the Allied cause of the initial phase ofthe operation to establish a foothold in Europe. Notwithstanding anxietiesabout the weather, tactical surprise was attained, and it is a matter for deepthankfulness that casualties were mercifully on a much lower scale than
anticipated. The press reports have fully covered the operations and I would merely underline certain important aspects.In the early stages of the war, inferiority in air power brought us somebitter experiences. The boot is on the other foot now. The numerical superiority of the United Nations on all fronts is a most heartening figure. As a result,the Allied Forces have an air shield of unsurpassed power, in addition to greatstrength for strategical bombing of important targets. An immense armadaof ships is also available for landing and supply operations, and the forces inthe bridgehead are being rapidly built up.With the timing of the Russian offensive and the advance in Italy, theGermans are being heavily assailed on three sides in a heavy and concerted blow.This is the dilemma that German strategy has always sought to avoid. It was for this reason that Hitler chose to attempt the elimination of Russia beforeconcentrating his entire strength on Britain. That he has not only failed, but has been called upon to pay a frightful price for his failure, is some indication of the service that the heroic Russian resistance has rendered to the united nations.Furthermore, the tyrannical heel of the German oppressors has so grounddown the peoples of the occupied countries, that the Nazis dare not weaken theirhold on any part of Europe. The moment they do so, the sorely-tried peoples and the Allies will grasp their opportunity to add to the enemy&apos;s embarrassments.The Germans are also endeavouring to maintain their position in the balkans, from which they draw vital raw materials and where political eventshave important repercussions in the rest of Europe. It will be recalled that,in the last war, Ludendorff said that he was convinced of Germany&apos;s inevitabledefeat when the first cracks developed in this region.The crux of the situation is the capacity of Germany to withstand all thesestrains and stresses. I offer no opinion on the speedy end of the struggle inEurope. No one knows the period for which they can continue to resist underthese conditions, or whether they may collapse or resist for longer by contractingtheir fronts. The primary aim of the United Nations is the destruction of theGerman Forces, and this will be unrelentingly and remorselessly pursued. It hasbeen said that no one can command success, but we can do everything to deserveit. Having done so, we can only wait on events, with confidence that victoryis certain, whether it may be long or brief in coming.3. The War against Japan.The plans for the war against Japan were discussed with General MacArthurbefore I left Australia, and on my return. While abroad, I also had discussions with Mr. Churchill, President Roosevelt, the Combined Chiefs of Staff and theUnited Kindgom and United States Chiefs of Staff.When the decision to defeat Germany first was taken in December 1941 which was before the transformation came over the Pacific situation by the lossof the Philippines, Singapore, and the Netherlands East Indies the war against japan was to be a holding one. As I have said on many occasions, the australian government never disputed the right of the Powers with the greatest resources to determine global strategy, but its view was that the forces allotted for the strategy to be employed against Japan should be adequate for the purpose. Wetherefore hailed with the greatest satisfaction the decision reached byMr. Churchill and President Roosevelt in May 1943 that the war in the Pacificwould be prosecuted with the same vigour as the war in Europe. Marvellousresults have since been achieved.A year ago. we used to speak of the great change which would occur whenRabaul could be neutralised and the Japanese pushed back to their main base at Truk. To-day, in the North Pacific, the American Forces have advanced theirfront 4,000 miles from Hawaii to the marinas, and General MacArthur, by hisenveloping movements, has brought to a close, for strategic purposes, thecampaigns in New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago.Another important pointer to the progress of operations against the Japaneseis the fact that, of the list of formidable tasks imposed on General MacArthurby his directive of April 1942, most of them have been accomplished. He nowfaces, with confidence, the final and, of course, most difficult and decisive phase 1the offensive, to defeat the enemy forces in the South-West Pacific Area-Mr. Churchill discussed the part to be played by United Kingdom Forces inthe ultimate defeat of Japan.   Though the transfer of the main British effort[28090] b 2
must await the defeat of Germany, large and powerful forces will become avail-able this year, and the planning of the whole British effort is being vigorouslypursued.  Mr. Churchill summed up the position as follows :  &quot; Though we might have to begin in a small way, we intend to pour all our forces into that struggle to which we are pledged by honour and fastenedby interest.&quot;In the vital element of seapower, the Japanese, who are already in greatlyinferior strength, will be outnumbered several times. When the full weight ofthe British and American land and air forces is brought to bear, the Japanesewill be as decisively defeated as Hitler. Final victory over the Axis Powers willnot have been achieved until we do so.I discussed with Mr. Churchill, President Roosevelt, the Combined Chiefsof Staff, and General MacArthur. the future part to be played by Australia in thewar against Japan. There was general agreement, both in London and washington, as to the lines our effort should take in the shape of fighting forces,the economic basis of the direct military effort and the contribution to be made towards the maintenance of forces in the Pacific and the provision of food for britain. I. emphasised in both London and Washington that, as the Australianpeople wish to have a say in how the Pacific Area is to be managed, they realise that the extent of their say will be in proportion not to the amount of wheat,meat or clothes, they produce to support the Forces of other Nations, but to theamount of fighting they do as well. There is, therefore, a minimum fighting strength below which Australia will not go. There is also a maximum strengthfor the Australian Forces, beyond which they cannot go, and it is the balance between these limits which the Government is seeking to fix.The Advisory War Council has agreed to certain recommendations for the review of the Australian war effort. After the Defence Committee has reported on the aspects relating to the future strengths of the Forces, the production executive, in consultation with the War Commitments Committee, will considerthe allocations of the balance of the man-power and woman-power. The totalposition will then be considered by War Cabinet and the Advisory War Council.We do not know how long it will take to defeat Japan, and we must see thatour effort is so organised that we have the stamina to stay the distance. Thehighest authorities have impressed on me that it is preferable that we should be certain of achieving what we attempt, even if it is less than we feel we might do, rather than that we should attempt too much and be uncertain of its fulfilment.Reliance must be placed on the contributions of all the United Nations in the plans that are being prepared.The Australian people will be glad to know that the account of their war effort, which I gave abroad, evoked the highest praise. Mr. Churchillreferred to: &apos;&apos; The very impressive account of the strides Australia has made in production since the outbreak of war, and to have mobilised over 26 per cent,of your men for the Forces is an achievement of which the country has indeeda right to be proud. I had certainly not realised before how great were thecalls upon Australia with the supply of food and general facilities for the prosecution of the war.&quot;The Foreign Secretary (Mr. Eden) said : &apos;&apos; It was not generally realised in the world at large how great a part the Australians had played in the South-West Pacific Area.&quot;The Minister of Food said : &apos;&apos; We at the Ministry of Food can never be too grateful for whatAustralia has clone for us in the supply of food since the war began.&quot;In his speech of welcome when I addressed the Canadian Parliament,Mr. Mackenzie King said :  &quot;After Pearl Harbour, after the fall of Singapore, before aid could come to you from any quarter of the globe, you and the people of Australiamust, have experienced terrible anxiety. What Britain had to endure when she stood alone facing the might of Germany, Australia for many monthsmust have felt in facing the might of Japan. As Britain kept open thegates of freedom in the North iVtlantic, so Australia and New Zealand kept open the gates of freedom in the South Pacific.
&quot; The free world will probably never realise what it owes to Australia.We are anxious, however, at this moment, to express what acknowledgementwe can of so great a debt. With this acknowledgment we wish to give toyou the assurance that just as your forces and ours have been exerting their strength wherever the call was most imperative in this global war; just asto-day we await with confidence the outcome of the colossal conflict whichwill crush for ever the menace of Nazi tyranny; so on the morrow our forces will be found closer than ever at the side of yours, sharing with our allies in the total destruction of the tyranny of Japan.&quot;This is a very graceful tribute from a sister Dominion, and we welcome the assurance of Canadian co-operation in the defeat of Japan.4. Foreign Policy in relation to the Conduct of the War.It is, of course, impossible to traverse in detail and in public, the highlysecret discussions on Foreign Policy, as they are closely related to the conductof the war. I can only refer in broad terms to the aims of Foreign Policy inwar.   They are : (i) To give all possible support through the diplomatic channel to thefighting forces in the conduct of operations.In occupied countries this means support of those elements thatare fighting the enemy. It also involves an assurance that, when thewar is over, the people of each country shall have a free chance toexpress their views, whether by elections or otherwise.In neutral countries, Foreign Policy must be employed as an instrument to support military operations by seeking to deny to theenemy aid which he might secure from these sources and, if possible,to divert it to our own war effort.(ii) To maintain unity among the iVllies in order to achieve victory andto lay the foundations during the war for future co-operation forthe maintenance of peace and the promotion of international collaboration.(iii) To prepare the terms to be imposed on the enemy, when defeated, andthe machinery of control. The European Advisory Commission,comprising representatives of the United Kingdom, the United Statesand Russia, is at present engaged on this task.There is, however, one cardinal aspect of Foreign Policy which I wouldmention. It is the vital importance to the future of the world, of collaboration between the British Commonwealth, the United States and Russia.One of the remarkable achievements of the war, for which too much creditcannot be given to Mr. Churchill and President Roosevelt, is the high degreeof friendship and co-operation which has been created between the BritishCommonwealth and the United States. It has been of fundamental importanceto the successful conduct of the war and, if what has been demonstrated to bepossible in war can be maintained in peace, a notable contribution will have beenmade to international relations of the future. The realisation of it should bea corner-stone of our foreign policy.Of parallel importance is the collaboration achieved with Russia in militaryoperations and in the Moscow Declaration for the building of an international organisation at the end of the war. This, too, must be maintained and devolped in the critical tasks that await the leaders of the United Nations when the victory is won. It must be equally an aim of our policy to develop the friendliestrelations with Russia too.My concluding observation on foreign policy is, to quote the declarationissued by the Prime Ministers at the conclusion of the Conference : &quot; We have also examined together the principles which determine our foreign policies, and their application to current problems. Here, too, weare in complete agreement ....&apos;&quot;&apos; Mutual respect and honest conduct between nations is our chief desire.We are determined to work with all peace-loving peoples in order thattyranny and aggression shall be removed or, if need be, struck down whereverit raises its head. The peoples of the British Empire and Commonwealthof Nations willingly make their sacrifices to the common cause. We seek noadvantages for ourselves at the cost of others. We desire the welfare and social advance of all nations and that they may help each other to betterand broader days.&quot;
5. Future World Organisation.After victory, the first task must be the framing of measures to preserveworld peace.   In the words of Mr. Churchill : &quot; We have no selfish aims. We have given all that we had. We areconcerned now only to ensure the establishment of a structure, by which we will be able to promise those who are fighting in this war and their descen-dants a peace with honour and safety.&quot;The maintenance of peace and security is, however, not merely an end initself, but a means for the promotion of an ordered society of nations hayingas its aim the welfare of mankind. Security must be blended with a positivepolicy based on high ideals of international conduct and human welfare. what are the ideals we seek to establish as the recompense to mankind for the sacrificesit has made? What is to be the machinery for the maintenance of peace andthe promotion of international co-operation to ensure their attainment?Ideals of Human Welfare.It was -the threat of danger to ideals of honest conduct in international relations that made the decent people of the world go to war in their defence.The moral fibre of a nation is indicated by the willingness with which it isprepared to defend the ideals which it regards to be the very essence of its wayof life. Only, however, if a people are enjoying worth-while rights will theylight to maintain them, and the standard of the civilisation of any nation or association of nations is to be judged by the rights of the mass of the people.The four essential freedoms defined by President Roosevelt and the commonprinciples of national policies, as outlined in the Atlantic Charter, must betranslated into national and international policies, not only to secure the rightsof man to freedom, but also to increase his well-being as an individual. Thishas been a total war of all the people. All have been called upon to serve andmany to suffer. This spirit of service and sacrifice has created a widespreadresolve that an age of peace and a better social order, leading to a fuller andmore abundant life, must supplant an era of war, of social indifference, economicinsecurity and want. The hope of better things to come has been the inspirationwhich has sustained the peoples of the United Nations and the source of their determination to see the struggle through until victory is won.Conditions of social betterment are not attainable without a lasting peace,and a durable peace is not possible until those causes of war, which have theirorigin in wrong social and economic conditions, are corrected. After the scourgeof two world wars, and an uneasy peace which was little more than an Armistice,all the dictates of reason and humanity demand that the leaders of nations shouldnot fail to achieve the vision of a happier, better and secure future for the humanrace. When this has been realised, the victory of arms will have been crownedby a still greater victory for mankind.The Organisation of Peace.The critical question that faces the United Nations is the creation of theappropriate machinery for the maintenance of peace to enable these ideals -to berealised in the realms of national policies and in the sphere of international relations where national policies make contact with each other.In London, the Prime Ministers discussed the principle of the machineryfor the preservation of peace and international collaboration, but it would be premature for me to attempt to outline a blue-print of the organisation.In Article 4 of the Moscow Declaration of November 1943 the Four Powersstate : &quot; That they recognise the necessity of establishing at the earliest practicable date a general international organisation, based on the principleof the sovereign equality of all peace-loving States, and open to membershipby all such States, large and small, for the maintenance of international peace and security.&quot;Until the ideas of the Four Powers are available for consideration by the othermembers of the United Nations, I can mention only certain broad principles which, in my opinion, are fundamental to any scheme adopted.
The first is that the organisation must include all the Great&apos; Powers within its membership. We must avoid a repetition of the mistake that occurred withthe League of Nations when some of the Great Powers stood out.When dealing with questions of global strategy during the course of thewar, even though the decisions might not have agreed with our views, I have always maintained that, as the Great Powers had the greatest responsibilities and resources, they had the right to take the major decisions regarding the conductof the war.It follows equally that we must look to the Great Powers with their resources to ensure the preservation of peace, until a permanent and effective system of security can be established. The Great Powers are obviously the nucleus of anyWorld Council that might be created.Some sceptics argue that the interests of the Great Powers are so competitivethat co-operation between the British Commonwealth, the United States and russia, is impossible. If this is the case, the future outlook for peace is bleakindeed. A prolonged period of peace is essential for recuperation and reconstruc-tion after the war and unanimity of the Great Powers on the need for it is. Ithink, sufficient assurance that it will be realised.I rely on the good faith of the Moscow Declaration which says : &quot; That, for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security,pending the re-establishment of law and order and the inauguration of asystem of general security, they will consult each other and as occasionrequires with other members of the United Nations, with a view to joint action on behalf of the community of nations.&quot;It is in this vital transition period that the foundations of a world organisa-tion must be well and truly laid. If this is done, a bulwark will have beenestablished against the recurrence of aggressions which have their origins in theclashing of rival national interests.The small nations of the world, as well as the great, have their part to play in the maintenance of peace. In many cases their geographical locations in important strategical areas make them potential battlegrounds. The bitterexperiences of Holland and Belgium throughout the centuries have only too wellearned for them the description of the &quot; cockpit of Europe.&quot; The dilemmaof the Small Powers has been one of the tragic experiences of the war. As weakneighbours of the aggressors, they have had the awful choice either of becomingtheir satellites or being over-run and occupied.The new system of world security must safeguard the weak as well as the strong, but the weak must recognise their responsibility for doing what they cantowards the defence of their territories and by co-operating in the wider systemof regional security in the areas in which they and their territories are situated.The enjoyment of benefits implies the obligations that go with them.A handicap of the League of Nations was the fear of the Great Powrers thatthey might be embroiled in war by the actions and decisions of the small States.The pendulum must not, however, swing too far in the other direction of mightbeing right. A corrective against such a tendency must be provided in the shape of an Assembly of Nations, where policy can be moulded by ascertaining the highest common denomination among the opinions expressed. The MoscowDeclaration lays down that the world organisation shall be based on the&apos;&apos; sovereign equality &apos;&apos; of States.Another handicap of the League Covenant was the too rigid definition ofthe occasions for action for the prevention of war. The consequence was aninability to take effective action when clanger arose. The cause of peace can bebetter served by flexibility, with power to make action effective, and responsi-bility to see that peace is maintained must be definitely assigned. The world organisation must have a combined naval, military and air staff to prepare plans and to co-ordinate action.There is also the important principle of regionalism through which the lesser Nations could effectively contribute to the working of the world organisa-tion. Last December I referred to the supreme importance of the world^system.of collective security being buttressed by regional arrangements and plans, andmentioned that the defence of the strategical area in which Australia, is locatedinvolves co-operation with the United Kingdom, the United States, NewZealand, and certain European Powers with territories in the Pacific. In anotherrealm of regional interest, the Australian-New Zealand Agreement provides forthe establishment of a South Seas Regional Commission ^directed towards the advancement and well-being of the native peoples of the Pacific.
Finally, there are functional bodies of a technical nature, such as those relating to&apos; Labour, Health and Transport, which will require to be related tothe World Organisation.The declaration issued at the conclusion of the Conference was limited toa general statement of adherence to a World Organisation : &quot;We affirm that after the war a World Organisation to maintainpeace and security should be set up and endowed with the necessary powerand authority to prevent aggression and violence.&quot;6. Improved Machinery for Empire Co-operation.A ustralian Proposals.I said last December that the evolution of the British Commonwealth hasexemplified the manner in which autonomous nations can co-operate on mattersof mutual interest, and I made certain suggestions for improved machinery forEmpire consultation and co-operation.During the Prime Ministers&apos; Conference, I put forward the following-proposals(i) The aim of all machinery must be to provide for full and continuousconsultation. This consultation must be consistent with the sovereigncontrol of its policy by each Government,(ii) No machinery which may be established can be superior to, or more satisfactory than, the periodical conferences of Prime Ministers of. the various parts of the Empire, provided they are held frequently.The place of meeting should not necessarily always be in London.(iii) The meetings of Prime Ministers should be supplemented and reinforced by meetings of other Ministers of the British Commonwealth as occasion may require, to deal with important questions of mutual.&apos; interest, such as trade and communications.   Again, these confer-ences, need not necessarily be held always in the one place.(iv) There should also be meetings at the official level between officers from the various parts of the Empire to deal with technical mattersor to carry out exploratory discussions, with a view to their subsequent consideration by Governments,(v) The procedure to be followed in London between conferences of PrimeMinisters should be :  (a) Monthly meetings of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,the High Commissioners of the Dominions, and the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs.(&amp;) The regular daily meeting of the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs and all the High Commissioners, which is the presentestablished practice.In addition, there is the ordinary day to day machinery for dealingwith the three groups of important questions Foreign Affairs,Defence, and Financial, Economic and Social questions.Foreign Affairs. The External Affairs staffs in the respectiveHigh Commissioner^ Office are in close contact with the ForeignOffice and each Dominion would create such machinery and employsuch methods as appear desirable, in the light of its owncircumstances.Defence. All the Dominions have their Service representatives in the United Kingdom. The position of the individual Dominionsdiffers so greatly that the machinery and procedure must be appropriate to the circumstances of each.Financial, Economic and Social Questions. During the war,there had been a great expansion of co-operation in regard to financial,economic and social questions. It is desirable that this co-operation should be maintained and increased.(vi) It was suggested that so much individual co-operation has now beenestablished that the time was opportune for bringing it under a central direction. It was proposed that an examination be made bya small Committee, representative of the United Kingdom and dominion Governments, as to whether some centralisation of effort is desirable.
Views of Governments.Mr. Churchill readily expressed his willingness to have monthly meetings with the Dominion representatives in London and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, and this met with general agreement.The Dominion Prime Ministers undertook to consult their Governments on my other proposals, and certain additional suggestions that were made duringthe discussion.I refer briefly to the views that were expressed.The United Kingdom Government put forward what were described ascertain lines of thought in regard to co-operation in Empire Defence. Theydid not proceed beyond the essential idea of the machinery that existed in peace in the shape of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and certain principles ofImperial Defence which had been laid down by earlier Imperial Conferences.The Prime Minister of Canada, in his address to the British Parliament afew days earlier, had said :--&quot;From time to time, it is suggested we should seek new methods ofcommunication and consultation. I believe very strongly in close consulta-tion, close co-operation, and effective co-ordination of policies. What more effective means of co-operation could have been found than those which, inspite of all the handicaps of war, have worked with such complete success \ &quot;During the Conference, Mr. Mackenzie King said that, while there was muchin my proposals with which he was in agreement, the questions raised wouldhave to be carefully considered, along with the whole range of matters connectedwith world security.The Prime Minister of South Africa did not express an opinion on my proposals.The Prime Minister of New Zealand said that there was little in my proposals with which he disagreed, and mentioned that the Australian-New ZealandAgreement provides for co-operation in regional defence in the South-West andSouth Pacific Areas.As I mentioned earlier, the position of each Dominion differs greatly inregard to defence, and our experiences in this war have varied accordingly.Canada has not been directly threatened in this war and, as a consequence,its military effort has been an overseas one. Mr. Mackenzie King explained tothe Conference that its defence arrangements are closely interlocked with theUnited States through a permanent Joint War and*Defence Board.South Africa, like Canada, is favourably located from a defence aspect, andhas not been directly threatened. Its military effort has been in Northern Africa,which General Smuts considers is within the European strategical zone.I envy our sister Dominions the good fortune of their geographical andstrategical locations, but our experience has been entirely different from theirs.I quoted earlier the graceful tribute paid by the Prime Minister of Canada to theway in which Australia had met the threat of invasion, and the steps which she had taken to deal with it. That situation brought out. the need for improvements in the machinery at the points of contact with Britain and the United States.As a result an Accredited Representative was appointed to the United KingdomWar Cabinet with the right to be heard in the formulation and direction ofpolicy. We also sought the appointment of a Pacific War Council at Washington,but when it failed to function we achieved our objective by establishing a directlink between the Australian Government and the Commander-in-Chief, South-West Pacific Area.I do not seek to convert my friend, Mr. Mackenzie King, to my point of view,any more than I can accept, from the Australian point of view, his opinion thatthe present means of co-operation has worked with complete success. A pre-eminent characteristic of the British Commonwealth is its diversity within the framework of its unity.My proposals for improved machinery for Empire Co-operation were accordingly put forward on the basis of what Australia considers to be necessaryin the light of its recent experience. I pointed out to the Conference that, though we all hope to be able to maintain peace by the system of world security whichit is our aim to build, the experience of the British Commonwealth has shownthat the growth of co-operation has been slow, notwithstanding that we have somuch in common. It remains to be seen how quickly and effectively we can develop and maintain a system of world security, but we dare not fail our own people in providing the security for which they so greatly yearn,    In doing so, by
co-operation amongst ourselves, we also contribute to world security at large. Theone is complementary to the other.I also observed that the security of any part of the British Empire in thefuture will rest on three safeguards, each wider in its scope than the other :- (i) There is the system of collective security which can be organised on a world and regional basis,(ii) Then there is the degree of Empire Co-operation which can beestablished. This is a matter of bilateral or multilateral planning andarrangement according to the strategical position of the particularpart of the Empire concerned, the views of its Government and thoseof the other Governments that may be concerned,(iii) Finally, there is national defence, the Policy for which is purely theresponsibility of the Government concerned. The extent and natureof a Governments Defence Policy will be influenced by the degree ofreliance that can be placed on the other two safeguards.These safeguards are complementary to each other, none is exclusive of the others, and plans should exist to give effect to them all.7. Colonial Questions.The discussion on colonial questions was primarily focussed on the establish-ment of regional bodies along the lines of the South Seas Regional Commissionprovided for in the Australian-New Zealand Agreement.General agreement was expressed with the value of such bodies as an aid tocolonial administration and in giving effect to the doctrine of &quot;trusteeship,&quot;which has as its aim the welfare of native peoples and their social, economic andpolitical development.8. Economic, Social and Transport Questions.There were also discussions on Economic, Social and Transport questions, towhich I shall refer briefly : Economic and Commercial Policy. Discussions on the technical levelregarding the scheme for an international monetary fund have been proceedingfor some months, and the Conference reviewed the stage which had been reached at the date of its meeting.A further conference i*at present in progress in the United States. any proposals formulated will be referred to the Governments concerned for their consideration.There was also a discussion on Commercial Policy, which had been consideredearlier in the year on the official level, but the matter has not been advancedsufficiently to enable a public statement to be made at the present time.Post-lVar Employment Plans.- The Conference was furnished with an outline of the United Kingdom Governments plans for the allocation of man-power between the forces and industry during any interim period between the endof hostilities in Europe and the defeat of Japan. This and wider aspects of theUnited Kingdom Governments Policy are covered in detail in the White paper on Employment Policy which is being tabled for the information of Parliament.Migration. The Conference agreed to a proposal by the United KingdomGovernment for an examination on the official level of possible arrangements formigration, on the understanding that the results would be submitted to the variousGoverments for consideration.Civil Aviation. The Conference reviewed the stage which had been reached in regard to post-war arrangements for Civil Aviation. As they are still thesubject of international discussion, it is not possible to make any useful public statement at present.Shipping. The Conference discussed post-war shipping policy, and agreed on certain principles as a basis for further inter-governmental discussions as occasion arose.9. Conclusion.The Conference was described by Mr. Churchill as one of the importantmilestones in the history of our united association.General Smuts said that, in his experience of the last forty years, he couldrecall no Imperial Conference which compared with it both in the magnitude
of the issues raised and in the spirit of mutual understanding that prevailedthroughout.An outstanding impression was the great significance and importance both to the members of the British Commonwealth and to the world, of the main-tenance and development of our unity and co-operation. The strength of GreatBritain has been described as her &quot;alliance potential,&quot; when she speaks withthe united voice and authority of the whole British Commonwealth. This is alsotrue of the Dominions, for individually we are weak, but united we are strong.Co-operation in regard to our policies should therefore be such as to ensurethat, mutually, we each command the support of the others. The BritishCommonwealth has demonstrated how this can be done among self-governingnations, without any infringement of their sovereignty.I was also impressed with the high principles which governed the approach to all questions. The meeting was not an exclusive British Commonwealth blocseeking its own selfish ends. The discussions were directed not only to strengthening the noble ties that unite us, but also to the advancement of thegreater cause of humanity at large. The success of this association of free nationshas been described as due to a simple human code founded on fair play, fairdealing, tolerance and justice, and the right of each to live his own life freely,so long as he does not interfere with the rights of others to live their lives equallyfreely. This is the common ground on which the members of the British Common-wealth meet like-minded nations in the wider amplitude of a World organisation which has as its aim the welfare of all men everywhere.In accordance with these ideals and ideas, the Commonwealth Governmenthas pledged itself to share with the United Nations the tasks of relief and rehabilitation. Our fighting forces now go to Europe as deliverers they do notmarch to overrun peoples as did the forces of Germany. In the -lands of the pacific, our purpose is attuned to these high dictates. Australia^ contribution&quot;to the relief and rehabilitation policy will be based upon our national income.The approximate figure is not less than  10 million. A bill on this matter willbe submitted.It will be gathered from what I have said that it is as an integral part ofthe British Commonwealth that Australia can most influentially express itself in the world organisation, and I have no doubt whatever that the unity of theBritish Commonwealth will, in the problems of the future, give to His Majesty&apos;ssubjects everywhere an authority in the consultations with other countries thatwill enable our concept of life to influence greatly the decisions which have to bemade, so that all we have fought for can be achieved.The relationships of the Dominions to each other and to the Mother country may even now not be completely understood by the rest of the world. But our influence, historically great, is at this stage greater than it has ever been, and,I am confident, will not grow less.Our readiness to associate in a world organisation does not lessen the realismof our membership of the British Commonwealth. It is requisite for all theDominions, and also for the Mother Country, that the subjects of the king should find not only means of consultation and agreement, but also that unity of delclaration which will maintain for the British Commonwealth that range of influence we believe it should have.There are great tasks confronting the people of this country. The immediate and most paramount consideration is the exertion of our complete capacity forwar. There are no bloodless roads to victory, either in Europe or the Pacific,and it is clear that every strategical concept underlying the conduct of the warby the United Nations involves war in the Pacific after the war in Europe has ceased. Therefore, there can be no early abatement of our concentration uponthe struggle which but yesterday was on our doorstep, to-day has been drivenaway from our mainland, and to-morrow will be fought at the very heart of theJapanese Empire itself.The sacrifices which our fighting men have still to make, the devotion theyhave yet to proffer, must be matched by the equal readiness of the civilian popu-lation to bear their part wholly and without limit.It is, however, sound policy that, from time to time, there shall be areassessment made of what is best to bring victory and what are the changes that should be made. In 1942, and last year, and for the greater part of thisyear, it was inescapable that every man that could be available to the fightingservices should be so allocated. Our war effort during the period in which wewere resisting invasion was reinforced by the contributions of our Allies, but
these contributions had to be set flowing. These were limited by the demandsof other theatres and they were also governed by the overriding considerations ofglobal strategy and the nature of the directive given to the Commander-in-chief in this theatre.Until the strength which our Allies could allocate to us had reached at least a given dimension, the paramount responsibility to maintain the fighting services in resisting the Japanese devolved on ourselves.Furthermore, on the civil population devolved the duty not only ofmaintaining, on an austerity standard, the physical needs of our people, and ofequipping and supplying to the uttermost of their capacity our own fighting forces, but also of meeting the needs of Allied servicemen in this theatre, as well asmaking contributions to other theatres.All this we have done. It has been done well. Its purpose has beenvindicated. The enemy no longer marches towards us he retreats. And theforces of the United Nations now march towards his heart to strike themortal blow.As I have indicated, in the discussions which I had with Mr. Churchill,President Roosevelt, and with the Combined Chiefs of Staff and with the Chiefsof Staff of the United Kingdom and of the United States, I have arranged forsteps to be taken to re-allocate the man-power resources of Australia. There isa fighting contribution which this country should make, and will make, until theenemy has been completely defeated. There are, however, leeways in the economic life of Australia which we should commence to overtake. Some part of the physical equipment for the maintenance of our war effort has to have strengthadded to it. I do not here intend to particularise. I merely say that the strengthof our fighting services has been the subject of a mutual understanding withour Allies. This will enable more but not unlimited man-power to be allocated to the economic services of the nation.I have also arranged what shall be the extent of the production of thiscountry which shall be allocated for export. This is part of the understandingthat has been reached.Two considerations enter into this matter. One is the realisation of thetotal nature of the Australian war effort, and the other is the capacity to supply the transportation required for that part of our production which other countriesrequire and can take.The problems of the diversion of our man-power from the tasks of peace tothose of war were not simple. Neither is it a simple matter to re-allocate tothe civil economy that portion of the man-power hitherto engaged in war and now required in the essential industries of the nation. It has to be donedeliberately on a common-sense basis, and wisdom, informed by knowledge as tothe total requirements, must govern what is to be clone.It would be a mistake for anybody to assume that all demands can besatisfied. There are orders of priority applicable to this problem as there areto every phase of production and industry in time of war. The very fact,however, that this country has reached the stage where this reassessment is nowpracticable, is evidence that the enemy&apos;s plans of conquest have grievously failed.Where he sought to conquer the world, he now faces what I believe to be a futileendeavour to avert signal and overwhelming defeat.I would add that, while sacrifices have been general on the part of the peoples of the United Nations, the first claim on our gratitude is that of the fighting-men and their dependants. It is the supreme duty of Governments to see thatthis debt is discharged. But the people as a whole deserve, by reason of allthe sacrifices they have made and the tribulations they have undergone, surceasefrom strain. Those of us who have the responsibility of government must sodischarge our high duties as to ensure that the freedom for which they havestruggled and the peace for which they hunger will be a freedom giving security against aggressors and security in the economic requirements of their personallives.   Thus only Avill security and peace be assured.I found faith in these high purposes in the discussions from which I have just returned. We are at war against evil forces. Mastering them, as we shall,we will from the idealism which has glorified our exertions gather&apos; the inspira-tion to combat those evil forces and conditions which, in our own countries inthe absence of aggression, were too considerable a feature of our national life.17/7* July, 1944.
ANNEX II.Speech by Eight Hon. j. Curtin, M.P., Prime Minister.(Closing the Debate on the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General&apos;s Speech.)I do not intend to do other than what it is in my heart to do; that is, toexpress to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Menzies), the Leader of theAustralian Country Party (Mr. Fadden),and other honourable members, apprecia-tion of the thoughtful and helpful speeches that have been made on the matters that were set out in my statement to the Parliament.It is perfectly true that that statement left unsaid much of what honourablemembers would doubtless like to have been told. I make no apology for that;because it has not been practicable, in connexion with the problems that have been dealt with in the debate on the Address-in-Peply, or, indeed, in connexion withthe matters with which I dealt while I was away, to do more than give a general indication of the trend of thought and activity.But I wish it to be particularly known that, while I was away, I did not enter into any secret commitment. I say that because I am not alone involved.I would have allowed the remark to pass, but for the fact that there might be animplication upon the Prime Ministers of the other Dominions as well as uponthe British Prime Minister. We had consultations in order that we might informthe mind of each other in regard to our respective points of view. We consideredthat we were interpreting the views of the countries which we represented, ratherthan our personal views, so that, in the formulation of policy, each Governmentwould be better equipped to act in concert with the other Dominions and, inparticular, with the United Kingdom.There are three observations which I should like to make. The first is, thata world organisation will be an invaluable contribution to the removal of the causes which lead to war. The next is, that the British Commonwealth mustpresent towards that world organisation the spectacle of a unified entity inmatters of the highest import. That does not mean that we have to integrateour Governments, nor does it mean that we have to present the spectacle of an absolute Empire bloc against the rest of the world. The Dominions, rather thanthe Motherland, have the largest interest in authoritative declarations whereby the British Prime Minister may speak for the Empire as a whole.Time and time again, it has been pointed out that this country has so small a population that we have to take steps to increase it rapidly. I am quitein favour of the steps to that end that are being taken. But it would be falseoptimism to consider that there is likely to be a rapid increase. The shipping to bring it here, and the places whence it is to come, are considerations whichhave to be taken into account.The problem of our security would not be fundamentally changed by anincrease of population from 7 million to 10 million, or even 12 million, in a reasonably short space of time; we should still rest on the postulate that, withoutfriends, allies and associates, we could be attacked by a superior force, and,perhaps, overrun.Therefore, whilst a world organisation can do a great deal to remove the causes which lead to war, we have had the experience that nations have gone towar without what those governed by goodwill and reasonable intelligence would regard as adequate justification; that is to say, the causes which lead &quot;to war werenot present.When the causes which lead to war, as they are understood, have been removed, it can be said that a contribution has been made to the peace of theworld; but that in itself would not constitute a guarantee of peace. Therefore,a concert of nations of like mind must be maintained.In that connexion, the observations of the Leader of the Opposition were most pertinent. The very case that he put that is to say, the indispensabilitvin any conception of world organisation of a real membership with entiregoodwill, not a mere formal membership of certain great Powers appears to meto be beyond argument.We generally address our minds to that problem in these days by sayingthat the sort of association which war has evoked must be maintained in theperiod after the war. But we would, I consider, humbug ourselves if we did notrealise that the problem is one which requires careful management.  All the time
it needs the most sober statement and most certainly makes it necessary that thesmaller parts of the British Commonwealth, however much they can offer theirown views, must offer them with discretion and in the light of such otherdiscussions as are proceeding.There is nothing easier than for a Prime Minister to make a speech onforeign affairs which is bound to cause difficulty and misapprehension somewhere.Therefore, when heads of Governments discuss the problem of the concert ofnations, they cannot always put forward with emphasis the particular views oftheir own countries, not because those views may not be justified, but becausethe bald statement of them in another part of the world, speaking a differentlanguage and probably facing different problems, may be entirely misunderstood.Therefore, our view has to be developed. We would first impart it to theBritish Commonwealth, the members of which would impart it to theirambassadors, and these would endeavour to develop a friendly acceptability ofthis point of view. We cannot approach by a crude and blatent declaration theproblem of getting other countries to see our point of view. All of these considerations properly impose a certain degree of restraint upon the heads of governments. A similar difficulty has no doubt been experienced by mypredecessors. I make no apology for my inability to be as candid in publicplaces in regard to certain problems of government as one can be about certain other problems of government.I shall do my best to promote the splendid suggestion of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender), in regard to the youth of Europe. They, atleast, are guiltless of any contribution to this frightful casastrophe. Animatedby the impulse of humanity, as well as by the value which that impulse will beto ourselves, we can promote as far as possible the realisation of the suggestion which the honourable gentleman has made.The same is true, except that our impulse is stronger, in respect of theorphan children of the United Kingdom. Recently a realisation of theirtribulations has been borne in on us even more poignantly than it was formerly.If one could add to the admiration which lovers of freedom everywhere in theworld have for the people of Britain, it would appear that now is the appropriate time, in what looks like being the stage that is leading to the successfultermination of the struggle, when they are being called upon to bear a speciallyheavy punishment. For that, we feel regret, and extend our sympathy; but our sympathy must be practical. That is why, in my statement, I indicated thenature of what will be a very great burden upon the people of Australia in theyears to come. In addition to resolving our own problems, we have to share in resolving the problems of the world. Wc have accepted the obligation ofmaking a very substantial contribution to the relief and rehabilitation of thecountries that have suffered.I do not wish to say more, other than that I believe that, however dis-appointed some honourable members may be with what I have said, the country as a whole has benefited by the debate which the House has just concluded.
