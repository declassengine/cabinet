(44) 514.9th September, 1944.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED S.O.E. OPERATIONS IN SLAM.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate for the information of my Cabinet colleagues the text of a letter which Admiral Mountbatten addressed to me on the 21st August regardingoperations which he desires S.O.E. to conduct for infiltration into Siam.2. Since this enterprise would involve contact with the new SiameseGovernment, and particularly with the Regent, Luang Pradit, AdmiralMountbatten very properly wishes to ensure that there are no political objections.He emphasises the operational advantages.3. S.O.E. have reason to expect help from Luang Pradit, who has, indeed,already approached them with suggestions for the dropping of S.O.E. partiesinto Siam. He is now the only remaining Regent, his fellow Regent havingrelinquished office at the time of the recent fall of Luang Pibul, the former PrimeMinister.   The new Prime Minister is a nominee of Luang Pradit.4, Sir J. Crosby, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Bangkok up to the time of theJapanese invasion and our leading expert on Siam, considers Luang Pradit theonly possible leader of the new Siam after the war. It was he who succeeded in ousting the Government of Luang Pibul, who had been virtual &apos;&apos; dictator &apos;&apos;(under the Japanese) and who is the real collaborationist. To the extent thatLuang Pradit and the new Government are still working with the Japanese theyare open to our condemnation. But facts have to be faced. The Japanese are in military occupation. There is no hope of immediate aid from outside, andLuang Pibul, the friend of the Japanese, is still a potential power. The chances of successful resistance are therefore at present slight, apart from the fact thatthe Siamese as a nation are not built that way. But, according to Sir J. Crosby,Luang Pradit himself has always taken as. independent a line as possible withthe Japanese and is working in his own way for ultimate collaboration with us.Sir J. Crosby believes that it would be a mistake to reject or ignore the approach which he has made.5. There is, of course, a risk that contacts even between a para-military organisation like S.O.E. and the Regent and Government of Siam might bemisconstrued by the latter as committing His Majesty&apos;s Government in some wayto them. I have been bound to consider the matter from this angle, and if political considerations alone were at stake I should advise my colleagues against this step. But I feel it is difficult on this ground alone to overrule AdmiralMountbatten&apos;s plea of military necessity. S.O.E., after all, was set up for thepurpose of conducting covert activities in enemy-occupied territory of precisely the kind here contemplated, and the organisation has in the past had similarclandestine contacts with other enemy Governments.6. I feel, therefore, that the problem is to reduce the possible political risk to a minimum.    I accordingly propose, if my colleagues concur, to inform12509   [28192]
Admiral Mountbatten that there will be no objection to S.O.E. proceeding withtheir plans provided that they make it clear beyond all possibility of misunder-standing in any dealings with the Siamese (a) that our only interest at present is the defeat of Japan and, so far as Siam is concerned, the expulsion of theJapanese from Siamese territory, and (b) that no political commitment whateveris involved as regards the ultimate regime and organisation of Siam.A. E.Foreign Office, Qth September, 1944.ANNEX.Admiral Mountbatten to Mr. Eden.Norfolk House,St. James&apos;s Square, London, S.W. 1,My dear Anthony, 21st August, 1944.I think it right that I should put on record that I am definitely anxious that S.O.E., India, should push on strenuously with the infiltration of their partiesinto Siam in order to establish an organisation in that country which would be capable, on receipt of appropriate commands from my Headquarters, of carrying-out operations likely to be of assistance to my forces in the execution of plans for the coming campaign which we have been discussing.So far S.O.E. have been able to make little substantial progress in this area,and it is clear that, if they are to get into a position to be of any use to me at thetime when I will want them, there is real urgency about the execution of theirpresent plans, and I would naturally wish that everything possible should be done to help them speed up their work.I understand from them that they have some hopes of being able to get on much faster as a result of the help in regard to the reception of their partieswhich they expect to get from the new Siamese Government which contains manyof the leaders of the group with whom they have previously been in touch.I fully appreciate that the question of contact with the new Siamese Govern-ment, and particularly with Luang Pradit, raises political considerations of which you must be the judge.I can only say that in view of the strategic value of some of the targetswhich they might be able to attack if they could get themselves established intime, and of the very considerable general interest which any substantial diversionin Siam at the right time would have for me, I must attach real importance andurgency to S.O.E.&apos;s plans for penetration into this area.I therefore hope that, in weighing these operational advantages against suchpolitical disadvantages as may exist in regard to S.O.E. plans, you will notunderestimate the former, and give all the help you possibly can.Yours ever,DICKIE.
