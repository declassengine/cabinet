THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 519.Ikth September, 1944.war CABINET.RE-EDUCATION OF GERMAN PRISONERS OF WAR,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Minister of Information.THE re-education of prisoners of war, to which the Foreign Office attachesgreat importance, is a recognised method of propaganda. It can be exploitedprofitably for short-term and tactical purposes during hostilities; it retains along-term value when the time comes for the re-educated prisoners to be repatriated.2. The responsibility for the re-education of prisoners in this country rests with the Political Warfare Executive. Particularly useful experience of the required technique has been gained with Italian prisoners in India and theUnited Kingdom.3. The Political Warfare Executive has not in any case been able as yet to apply this technique to German prisoners in the United Kingdom because ithas been the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to pass them on to Canada assoon as possible. Thus, the time has not been available.4. This policy has been changed by the recent Cabinet decision to hold upto 17,000 German prisoners in the United Kingdom, a ruling which confronts thePolitical Warfare Executive with a formidable task, and the number of german prisoners arriving in this country is increasing. It has also been proposed thatthe Political Warfare Executive should undertake the re-education of the30,000 German prisoners now in the Middle East. The Political WarfareExecutive cannot accept responsibility for carrying out these tasks unless certainfacilities, which they know from experience are essential to success, are forth-coming.5. The indispensable facilities required by the Political Warfare Executiveare (i) the segregation in separate camps of all prisoners who, in the opinionof the Political Warfare Executive^ Camp Visitors, are extremeNazis;(ii) the prevention, after segregation, of all communication between theseextremist prisoners and the rest;(iii) the segregation in separate camps of converts and likely converts;(iv) the full co-operation with the Political Warfare Executive of themilitary authorities concerned and, in particular, of all campcommandants;(v) the appointment to every camp of at least one interpreter who will actas an agent for the Political Warfare Executive.A Cabinet decision in the foregoing sense is sought.A.
