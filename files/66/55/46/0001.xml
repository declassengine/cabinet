THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 546.&apos;29th September, 1944.WAR CABINET.EASTERN ARCTIC AIR ROUTES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I think that Ministers may be interested to read the attached despatch fromthe United Kingdom High Commissioner at Ottawa reporting on a recent visit to the air-bases built by the American Army Air Force in the Eastern Arctic.In forwarding the despatch, the High Commissioner commented that it was perhaps more in the nature of &quot;light than heavy reading,&quot; but I feel-that ministers may find his account of United States activities and extravagancespfreal interest. f      / **C.Dominions Office,29*A September, 1944.Office of the High Commissionerfor the United Kingdom,(No. 496.) Earnscliffe, Ottawa,My Lord, 29*A August, 1944.I have the honour to report that I have recently returned from a flying tourof the air-bases built by the American Army Air Force in the Eastern Arctic.The Canadian Government are about to purchase these airfields, all of which are on Canadian soil. They therefore sent a party of R.C.A.F. and civilian experts to inspect them.  Mr. O. L. Williams and I accompanied the party.2. Starting from Ottawa we flew first to Winnipeg. Thence we visited the bases at The Pas and Churchill in northern Manitoba, near Coral Harbour onSouthampton Island, Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island, Chimo in Ungava, GooseBay in Labrador, and Mingen and Seven Islands on the Gulf of St. Lawrence.After that we returned to Ottawa.3. Except for The Pas (which was built by the Canadians to Americanspecifications), Goose Bay (which was built and is partly operated by the canadians) and Seven Islands (which was built and is wholly operated by the canadians), all these airfields were built and are being operated by the Americans.Some of them are mother stations for smaller establishments in the region, wheremeteorological and/or wireless units function. The Churchill base, for example,has such offspring at Cape Churchill and Eskimo Point on the west shore ofHudson Bay. whilst that at Frobisher Bay has given birth to triplets parked indifferent regions of Baffin Island. Unfortunately we could not visit any of theseminor stations. They are not equipped with landing strips for wheeled aircraft,and so can only be visited by machines on floats in summer and on skis in winter.We were flying in a Dakota on wheels.4. In the course of our tour we had many glimpses into the customary life of north-eastern Canada.. We saw Hudson Bay Company posts, religiousMissions, Royal Canadian Mounted Police stations, Eskimo summer camps and indian villages. Much about these simple, lonely and heroic communities isfascinating. But I should nojt divert your attention from more urgent businessby tales of them, since they are not likely to require the official concern of theDominions Office.[28296] b
5. But you may be interested to read something about the air-bases. Theyare striking examples of the American nation&apos;s magnificent impertinence,imaginativeness, energy, mechanical skill and extravagance. I do not use theword il impertinence &quot; only because. I understand, their Army authorities startedthese works on Canadian territory without properly informing or consulting the Canadian Government. It is also because they treated with similar in-difference the obstacles which Nature whose sovereignty in the Arctic is evenmore supreme than that of the Canadian Government -put in their way.6. The results are remarkable. Let me give as an example the Americans&apos;achievement at the most northerly of their main air-bases, in Frobisher Bay onBaffin Island. Frobisher Bay is a long arm of the sea reaching about 60 milesfrom ITuclson Strait into the interior of the Island. Its shores are naked rocks,rising in many places precipitously from the watets edge to a height of over1.000 feet. A vast ice-field sprawls across many of the heights, and from its edgeglaciers slip slowly into the sea. The shore line is jagged and indented bynumerous fjords. We visited the place in the middle of August. Even then agreat fleet of ice-bergs floated on the broad calm waters of the Bay.7. The airfield lies at the head of the Bay. where a river runs into the sea.A considerable patch of gravel and sand has collected there. On this two runwayshave been constructed, about 70 feet above.sea level. The rocky hills in thevicinity stand back a little way from the airfield, and here they do not rise to more than 400 feet above the sea. We were told that any possible danger to aircraft was reduced by the fact that during 98 per cent, of the time the pre-vailing wind allows landings and departures to fake place on a 6.000-feet runwaywhich stretches along the river valley and is approached from the open bay atone end and across reasonably low ground at the other.8. Prior to the Americans&apos; arrival this place was utterly desolate. the nearest Hudson Bay Company post was 100 miles away. Occasionally afew passing Eskimo families used an island off-shore as a summer fishing camp.The only-regular visitors were sea-gulls, ravens and seals.9. Here the Americans have built what is in effect a small town. Thepresent population is about 100 officers and men, but there is accommodation foreight times that number. I stayed in the Commanding Officer&apos;s house, which islike a glorified boarding-house. It has several guest rooms, a &quot; bathroom &quot; with three wash-basins and a shower, all plentifully supplied with running hot andcold water, and a lounge with a well-stocked bar above which stands the proudinscription: &quot; The only circular bar in the Friendly Arctic.&quot;&apos; The rooms are well and comfortably furnished. Their panelled walls are decorated with a striking collection of pictures of the Arctic dressed in its white winter frockand of pin-up girls dressed in practically nothing at all. The lounge contains asmall library of books. Its inmates keep in touch with the rest of the Earth bymeans of a fine wireless set which reports perfectly everything that London, new york, Moscow, Berlin. Tokyo and any other large centre speaks or croons tothe world.10. Besides the runways, an operations building, a hangar, a workshop andthe other appurtenances of a modern aerodrome, there are various establishments in the station. These include barracks, mess-rooms and kitchens; a twenty-fivebed hospital with a completely up-to-date operating-room, X-ray department and dentists quarters; a shop and coffee-house; a theatre furnished for film shows,the legitimate drama and concerts; a laundry, a barbers shop and Turkish bath-house. Each of these is equipped with everything necessary to perform to thefull its proper functions. The shop, for instance, provides, amongst a lavishdisplay of other goods, every item of food or drink that a &quot; super&quot;&quot; ice-creammachine and soda-fountain respectively can concoct. A new programme of filmsis shown in the theatre three times a week. Sometimes the latest feature filmsfrom Hollywood can be seen in the Arctic wastes before they are seen in NewrYork or Chicago. The principal defect in the air-base is the lack of femininesociety. The legend that on Southampton Island and Baffin Island there is &quot; agirl behind every tree &quot; is literally true, as the doughboys sadly perceive whenthey first behold the treeless landscapes. But even the gentle sex appearsoccasionally, when touring companies of actors and actresses drop in to spend anevening entertaining the boys in the Arctic.11. Shooting and trapping on land are forbidden to white men on BaffinIsland. These activities are reserved for the Eskimoes, for whom they may bea matter of life or death. But the air-base is well furnished with motor-boats and fishing rods for those who like to take part in the excellent char-fishing there.The Americans will also take you on seal hunts in the winter and spring, with
harpoons or rifles according to your taste. The dog-sleighing during the nine months of snow is excellent. The air-base owns kennels with about fifty well-born and bred Canadian, Alaskan and Siberian huskies. At the same seasonthe ski-ing is good.12. I can highly recommend the food and drink provided in the mess atFrobisher Bay. Three meals are served each day; with soups, eggs, pork, poultry,meats, vegetables, sweets, &amp;c, both lavish in quantity and enjoyable in quality.It is the same at Churchill, Southampton Island and the other air-bases. the americans have certainly made the Arctic where travellers used to liveskimpily, when they did not positively starve, on such seal meat and fish as theycould find realise that there is a war on.13. These airfields were, of course, built for strategic purposes. Whatprecise strategic objects they might serve -was anybody\s guess. If the AxisPower had overwhelmed Britain, one arm of their attack on North Americamight have swung clown through the Arctic. In that case these airfields would no doubt have been important defence outposts. They might have been involvedin bloody military actions. Alternatively, if fighting in the German war was confined to Europe, there seems to have been an idea in somebody&apos;s head that the airfields might be used for evacuating and treating wounded American soldiersfrom the fronts. In either of these cases ample accommodation and equipment for treating casualties would be required. Hence, the large, magnificentlyequipped hospitals and laundries which are generally amongst the principal features of the airfields.14. But undoubtedly the primary use of the bases was to be as steppingstones for aircraft making the gigantic hop-skip-and-jump from North Americanfactories across the Atlantic to the European fronts. The chain of airfieldsthrough North-Western Canada to Alaska (on which I reported in my despatch no. 608 of the 4th September, 1942*) has been extremely valuable for a similarservice to the Pacific and Russian fronts. But, as it turns out these Eastern Arcticairfields have in practice served no such purpose. A more southerly route, throughGoose Bay, has proved more convenient and speedy. So the establishments atThe Pas/Churchill, Southampton Island, Frobisher Bay and Chimo have beenuseless.   They have been in every sense of the words left out in the cold.15. They have proved a colossal piece of over-insurance, which, of course, has its part in a world war on whieh the future of human civilisation hangs. Theirbarracks are only half-filled, their hangars are bare and their hospitals areuninhabited, except for the odd Eskimo who finds his or her w7ay there, and afew American soldiers suffering from complaints which they might have gotanywhere. The bases&apos; prospective uselessness was recognised by the american authorities before the work was completed. It was stopped at that point. AtChurchill, for example, the palatial hospital has not a single item of medical orsurgical equipment, except a $1,000 lamp stuck in the ceiling above the emptyspace where an operating table should have been. And on most of the airfieldsthe third side of the proposed triangle of runways has been left unfinished.16. Whether the airfields will serve any greater purpose in peace-time is, tosay the most, problematical. Some of the hospital beds and equipment may come in useful as aids to the present sparsely scattered medical service for the 300 moreor less regular white inhabitants and the 6,000 Eskimoes who inhabit the EasternArctic. A runway here or there may come in handy once in a blue moon for aircraft concerned with such minor economic developments as may be possible inthe Hudson Bay region and the Arctic Archipelago. There is just a possibility that they may find a place in some regular air route of the future. But therunways and their expensive&apos; attachments are more likely to fall quickly intodesuetude and gradually into decay. I rather think that the Americans haveadded to the schools of White Whales, families of White Bears and thousands of white Foxes, which are the commonest inhabitants of those regions, a fine littleherd of White Elephants.17. Of course, in case of another war they may still prove to have strategic importance for defence or attack against the enemies of the North Americanpeoples. The American Colonel who is in command of the American Army AirForce in Central Canada, and who accompanied us on our tour, expressed theopinion that this was their sole possible use. The Canadian Government may wellconsider it worth while maintaining them in some shape for this purpose. Thatis a decision which they will have to take in due course in the light of all the relevant facts. The survey party which I accompanied was charged withgathering as many of those facts concerning the airfields themselves as possible.[28296]* W.P. (42) 465.
Some even of these facts are disappointing. It seems that the Americanengineers responsible for the construction work were always inexperienced and sometimes ill-advised about construction requirements in the Arctic. Some of therunways already betray a tendency to sag and even collapse. Some of the buildingsshow signs of falling apart. They may need much expensive adaptation to therigours of Arctic existence. The Canadian experts on our party shook theirheads sorrowfully at this bold but fleeting work.18. However, for reasons of sovereignty and high policy, the canadian government have decided that they should acquire from the Americans all thepermanent installations and equipment which they have created on these airfields.I understand that the purchase price is to be the American costs of productiontranslated into Canadian terms. If the whole undertaking turns out to be aseries of colossal errors, the Canadians are literally going to pay for the americans&apos; mistakes.19. I enclose an admirable memorandum prepared by Mr. 0. L. Williamsrecapitulating briefly the salient facts about this North-Eastern air route, fromwhich it will be seen that the bill which the Canadians will pay for the basestots up to nearly $32,000,000.I have the honour to be.My Lord,Your Lordship&apos;s most obedienthumble servant,MALCOLM MacDONALD.Enclosure.Origin and Development of the North-East Staging Route.AT a time when the production of aircraft in North America was expectedto undergo its greatest expansion, plans were laid for the construction of alter -native air routes from Canada to Europe which would relieve the Newfoundlandbase at Gander of a pressure of air traffic with which it was expected to be quiteunable to cope. Accordingly, in the summer of 1941, a survey was made inLabrador leading to the discovery of an ideal site at Goose Bay, upon which work was begun immediately and completed by the winter. It was contemplated that from Goose Bay it would be possible to ferry short-range aircraft to Europe via the intermediate bases at that time being constructed in Greenland and Iceland.2. A year later, in June 1942, the permanent Joint Board of Defence of theUnited States and Canada approved the immediate construction of a morenortherly route through Hudson Bay and the Eastern Arctic in a chain of bases extending from Winnipeg through Le Pas, Churchill, Southampton island and Frobisher Bay in Baffin Island. In conjunction with this, a supplementaryroute through Northern Quebec via Fort Chimo on Ungava Bay was to link up atFrobisher Bay with the main northern route. These two routes in their turnconnected with the Greenland and Iceland hops.3. The North-East Staging Route as a whole was thus designed to ferry all types of aircraft from North America to the European theatre of war. It will beseen that strategically the base at Goose Bay occupied the key position in that itconstituted an alternative both to Gander for long-range aircraft and to thenorthern route for short-range aircraft.4. With the exception of the airfields at Le Pas and Goose all the bases in the North-East Staging Route were built by the United States Army AirForce. The other two were built by the Canadian Department of Transport to united States specifications. All are operated at present by the United states air Force, with the exception of Goose, which is under separate Canadian and united States commands. The United States command of the whole chain of bases itself falls into two sections. Le Pas, Churchill and Southampton Islandoperate under the command of the United States Army Air Force in CentralCanada, while Frobisher Bay, Chimo and the American part of Goose Bay come under the north-east wing of the Eastern Division of the United States army air Force. N5. As may well be imagined, the construction of each of these basespresented formidable difficulties. The country lying to the north of northernManitoba, Ontario and Quebec is underlain throughout its length and breadthby the rock of the Pre-Cambrian shield. Between irregular outcrops of this rockthe top soil consists either of sand or, further north where the forest ceases, ofspongy muskeg several feet deep with here and there deposits of sand or gravel.
The winter covering- of ice and snow which, owing to the extreme temperatures,makes construction impossible in any other season but the summer, turns duringthe spring into an impenetrable morass of swamps and lakes. At Le Pas innorthern Manitoba the engineers had to select a spot which was relatively free from swamp and. having cleared the forest, to remove quantities of rock andboulder which obstructed the runways. In Churchill they had to remove severalfeet of muskeg over a wide area and fill it with crushed rock before laying the top surface. On Southampton Island large outcrops of gravel between areas ofmuskeg provided a wider choice of site but a great deal of draining and levellingwas necessary. In Frobisher Bay the engineers built on sand as also at FortChimo, where the forests had also to be cleared and much levelling was required.In every case, as might be expected, the cost of constructing the runways aloneformed a significant proportion of the total cost of the base. Signs are notwanting that the construction was so hurried as to be detrimental to the durabilityof the runways and to their powers of resistance to the rigorous winter.6. The following supplementary details of the United States operatedbases are given for the sake of completeness :  The Pas-Latitude : 500 58&apos;.Longitude :  100o 06&apos;.Altitude : 886 feet above sea level.Runways:  Two asphalt runways, 6,300&apos;x 200&apos;, 4,200&apos;x 200&apos;.Hangar :  One 200&apos; x 120&apos;.-   Fuel Storage Tanks : Two 1.000 gallons each.Churchill Latitude : 580 45&apos;.Longitude: 450 05&apos;.Altitude : 100 feet above sea level.Runwavs : One concrete runway. 6,000&apos; x 160&apos;; one asphalt runway,6.000&apos; x 200&apos;.Hangar : One 120&apos; x 100&apos;.Fuel Storage : In drums.

Brief particulars of this base are as follows :  Latitude : 50o 17&apos;.Longitude : 640 09&apos;.Altitude : 71 feet above sea level.Runways : Two 5,000&apos; x 150&apos;.Hangar : One 82&apos; x 120&apos; (nose hangar)Fuel Storage : 3,500 gallons.
7. The United States Government doubtless had long-term considerations in mind when they decided to press forward the building of these bases. but from the point of view of its war-time utility the northern branch of the North-East Staging Route has not lived up to expectation. For this there are several reasons. In the first place the base at Goose Bay was found to enjoy incomparablysuperior weather conditions to any other in that area. It remains open to aircraft on the average 95 per cent, of the year. On the other hand, in HudsonBay and the Arctic islands fogs develop rapidly over the whole area during the summer months, which render the use of&apos; all the bases there most uncertain, while in the winter the snowfall, although not particularly heavy, is subject to constantblizzards and drifts. Another factor which contributed to the failure of this route was the unexpected development on a large scale of the South Atlantic route,which became possible with the liberation of North Africa. This greatly relievedthe strain on Gander and Goose and enabled them to cope with all the traffic-available. It is a sad spectacle, although perhaps an unavoidable misfortuneof war. that these finely constructed and equipped bases, designed to handle asmuch as 1,000 aircraft a month, have never been used for more than two or three aircraft a week, which fly regularly but mainly with supplies for the local bases.8.   As an illustration of the situation described above, the&quot;following statistics of personnel on the bases may be given : The Pas-Full complement : 450 persons.Present: 7 officers. 143 men.Churchill-Full complement : 1.500 persons.Present: 12 officers, 138 men.Southampton Island Full complement : 500 persons.Present: 8 officers. 77 men, 30 civilians.Frobisher Bay Full complement : 800 persons.Present: 9 oificers. 71 men and a few civilians.Fort Chimo Full complement : 700 persons.Present : 8 officers, 87 men, 60 civilians.Mingan Full complement : 250 persons.Present : 12 officers. 118 men.9. With the approach of the end of the war in Europe the Canadian and united States Governments recently decided to come to an agreement in regardto the disposal of these bases, as well as of those along the North-West StagingRoute. On the 1st August. 1944, Mr. Mackenzie King announced that such anagreement had been signed and that it provided for the transfer to the CanadianGovenment of all immovable defence installations at the bases within one year after the cessation of hostilities. At the same time the Canadian Government wasto reimburse the United States Government in full the sums expended in theconstruction of the route, subject only to a reduction in respect of expendituresby the United States not resulting in equipment of permanent value. Paymentsthus agreed upon amounted to United States $31,631,310 and may be summarisedas follows : $The Pas      ..................        415,000Churchill     ..................      6,206,800Southampton Island ......... 5,318,870Frobisher Bay       ...............      6,833,190Fort Chimo............... 8,686,470Goose Bay    .................. 543,000Mingan       ............      ,.....      3,627,980Total...............     31,631,310O.
