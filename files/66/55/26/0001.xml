THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  September 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 526.23rd September, 1944.WAR CABINET.DRAFT CONSTITUTION FOR THE FOOD AND agriculture organisation.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs..THE War Cabinet have already considered a first draft* prepared by the interim Commission of a Constitution for a permanent Food and agriculture organisation and they agreed? that His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept a constitution in that form subject to two qualifications : (i) In conveying the acceptance of His Majesty&apos;s Government the UnitedKingdom delegate on the Interim Commission was instructed to makea declaration to the effect that, in the understanding of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, the Constitution did not confer on the Organisationdirect executive functions in regard to agricultural credit or agricul-tural commodity arrangements. This declaration was duly made andhas been put on record in the minutes of the Interim Commission,(ii) If other Governments put forward amendments to the draft Constitutionat that stage, it was agreed that there would be an opportunity for ourdelegate also to press for certain desirable amendments. OtherGovernments did, in fact, suggest amendments, and, as a result, ourdelegate secured certain improvements in the text.2. The Interim Commission has now taken account of all the commentsreceived from the different Governments and has forwarded to them for acceptancewhat will, it is hoped, be the final draft of the Constitution. I attach the text asan appendix. This final draft does not differ greatly from the earlier versionand what changes there are represent, generally speaking, improvements on theearlier version. I therefore recommend that my colleagues should approve thedraft Constitution. There are still one or two points on which the technicaldrafting could be improved or on which clarification would be desirable, but theseare minor points and I do not think it necessary to trouble the War Cabinet withthem. A note of these points has been sent to our delegate on the interim commission. If Governments again put forward amendments, he will have anopportunity of raising these points. Alternatively, if it is thought desirable atthe time, occasion can be taken at a later date to put forward amendments to theConstitution at one of the Meetings of the Organisation when it has been set up.The procedure laid down in the draft Constitution is that, when 20 notifica-tions of acceptance by Governments have been received by the Interim Commission,the Constitution will be signed and the Food and Agriculture Organisation will then come into being.3. It will be desirable to publish the draft Constitution, and I suggest thatit should be laid as a White Paper together with the text of the communicationby which it is accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Government. I think it will also be advisable to lay the report of the Interim Commission with which the draft* W.P. (44) 161. f W.M. (44) 39th Conclusions.Copy No.[28241]
Constitution has been forwarded to the Governments concerned, since this report has been given to the Press both in Washington and London. I suggest that boththe Report and the draft Constitution should be laid as one White Paper, althoughGovernments have not been asked to accept the former, representing as it doesonly the views of the members of the Interim Commission who took part in the drafting: of the Constitution.4.   I accordingly recommend: (a) that His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept the draft Constitutionannexed to this paper;(b) that the draft Constitution and the acceptance of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and the Interim Commission^ report should be laid as a white paper.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,23rd September, 1944.
