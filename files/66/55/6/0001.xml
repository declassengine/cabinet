naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Coastal forces and shore batteries have attacked enemy shipping- passingup Channel.The enemy has carried cut extensive demolitions in French and BelgianChannel ports.U-boats have been operating in coastal areas off the West Coast.One U-boat has been sunk and one probably sunk.Northern Waters.2. On the 1st, in an area east of Greenland near Shannon Island, which issuspected formerly to have been a German meteorological station, an enemytrawler was intercepted by the U.S. coastguard vessel Northland and immediatelyscuttled. This trawler was apparently escorted by a U-boat which unsuccessfullyfired torpedoes.Home Waters.3. A convoy of nine ships from North Russia has arrived in Home waters without loss.4. On the 1st H.M.S. Hurst Castle (corvette) was torpedoed and sunk by aU-boat off the north coast of Ireland (R).English Channel.5. Bad weather has hindered the sailings of Channel convoys and unloadingat Cherbourg. The totals unloaded up to p.m. on the 6th were 2,093,855 men,440,199 vehicles and 3,480,652 tons of stores.6. On the 1st, HALS. Malaya bombarded enemy batteries and the barrackai&apos;ea of the lie de Cezembre (off St. Malo) which has since surrendered. On the5th, HALS. Erebus (monitor) was damaged off Havre by a shell from shore batteries.7. On the night of the 1st/2nd, there was a considerable northboundmovement of enemy ships through the Strait of Dover. Two Canadian M.T.Bs.drove oft&apos; and damaged E-boats off the South Foreland; coastal batteries claim tohave sunk or damaged seven enemy ships which were attempting to pass upChannel, and M.T.Bs., in two further actions, sank a landing craft and probably sank two others. Enemy shore batteries forced the M.T.Bs. to disengage withoutsuffering damage or casualties. On the night of the 4th/5th return fire by ourcoastal batteries is claimed to have sunk one of a group of E-boats operating inthe Strait.  HALS. Middleton (destroyer) was slightly damaged early on the 6th.8. At Antwerp port demolitions were slight and the harbour may in fact be said to have been captured intact. The outer harbour at Dieppe can nowaccommodate up to six coasters. Morlaix is now ready to take six liberty ships atmoorings and eight coasters in the harbour. At Roscoff (N.W. of Morlaix) alimited anchorage is available.Bay of Biscay.9. On the 4th the Polish destroyer Blyskawica embarked two Alliedpersonnel and three German military prisoners at Les Sables d&apos;01onne (offLa Rochelle) which is controlled by the F.F.I.On the 6th HALS. Kelvin (destroyer) captured two suspicious vessels in thesame area; 24 prisoners were landed and one officer prisoner was retained.Mediterranean.10. The islands in the Marseilles area surrendered unconditionally on the30th and by the following day 886 prisoners had been taken.Unloading on the beaches has been hampered by bad weather and severallanding craft driven ashore.
11. On the 1st U.S.S. Woolsey (destroyer) bombarded gun&apos;positions south-west of Monaco, and on the following clay, with U.S.S. Edison (destroyer),bombarded other targets in the same area. On the 3rd, U.S.S. Philadelphia(cruiser) and a destroyer bombarded enemy positions in the Monte Carlo area.12. In the Adriatic on the 28th August, H.M.S. Loyal (destroyer) bom-barded targets near Pesaro in support of the army advance, and on the 30th andthe 1st September, with H.M.S. Undine (destroyer), bombarded enemy positions in the same area. On the 4th, Loyal and H.M.S. Urchin (destroyer) bombardedenemy positions in the Rimini area.13. On a recent patrol in the iEgean H.M. S/M VirUie sank three caiquesoff Milos.East Indies.14. On the 22nd H.M. S/M Spiteful bombarded oil cisterns on christmas island (South of Sumatra) and was herself slightly damaged by gunfire fromshore batteries. On the same day H.M. S/M Tudor sank a 100-ton junk by gunfire.Whilst on patrol off Penang EM. S/M Tally-Ho sank a 300-ton coasteron the 22nd and three junks on the 24th. On the 2nd September, H.M. S/M Sirdarattacked a convoy off the north-west coast of Sumatra and damaged an escort vessel and a coaster.Pacific.15. From the 31st August to the 2nd September, ships of the U.S. PacificFleet attacked the islands of Iwo Jima (Volcano Islands) and Chichi Jima (BoninIslands). On the 4th, Wake Island was attacked.

Of these, seven were by warships and two by carrier-borne aircraft.On the 1st, ships of the 9th escort group (R.GN.) sank a U-boat off Land&apos;sEnd, and on the following day aircraft from H.M.S. Vindex (escort carrier) andescorts of a convoy from North Russia probably sank another west of the LofotenIslands.Enemy Intelligence.17. It was reported during the week that the enemy was planning to defendLa Rochelle and La Pallice. At Bordeaux the tanker quays have been extensivelydemolished and the entrance to the harbour blocked.At Calais all the principal quaysides and installations have been partially destroyed; the entrance channel to the tidal basin has been obstructed with sunkencraft, the entrance locks to the Bassin Carnot have been demolished and the outerbreakwaters have been breached in several places. At Boulogne many of theprincipal quays have been destroyed and the entrance channel has been blocked.In both these ports and at Havre no active shipping has been seen. At Brestthe floating dock has been sunk.18. North of Calais, no shipping was seen at Ostend on the 5th; atZeebrugge 12 landing craft and two E/R boats were seen; it is reported thatthe entire mole has been mined and that torpedo tubes have been placed in positionhere and at Flushing, whence torpedoes could be fired against our ships. No activeshipping was seen at Dunkirk; since the 3rd, an escort ship, 21 E/R-boats and12 landing craft have left. Two blockships were sunk and there have been con-siderable demolitions. On the 6th, 13 landing craft, six E/R-boats and fivetrawlers were seen at Flushing.  No demolition activity was seen at Ijmuiden.U-boats.19.   Up to 20 U-boats are on passage from Biscay bases to Norwegian ports.Inshore patrols have been maintained in coastal areas off the north coasts ofIreland (R) and Cornwall and off N.W. Scotland.  Two U-boats are operating in[28162] B
the Gulf of St. Lawrence and one in the Freetown area. In Baltic ports126 U-boats have been located during the week.The U-boat shelters at Bordeaux are reported intact but their workshopshave been blown up.Enemy Attack on Shipping.20. During the week three ships have been sunk by U-boats. One ship, inan outward-bound convoy, was sunk off the north coast of Ireland (R) and theother two wei-e sunk south of Newfoundland and east of Socotra respectively.21. Provisional shipping losses by enemy action during August were95,758 tons.Protection of Seaborne Trade.22. During the week ending the 3rd, 836 ships in convoy in the Northx\atlantic arrived at their destination. Of these, 361 were in ocean convoys and472 in British coastal convoys. Forty-one destroyers (including 22 U.S.destroyers).and 72 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employed on escort duties&apos; Four homebound convoys, consisting of 150 ships, and four outward-bound convoys, of 214 ships, reached their destinations. A tanker in a homeboundconvoy was sunk.Allied Minelaying.23. Mines have been laid by surface craft in the English Channel. aircraft have laid mines off the Dutch islands, the German North Sea coast and in the danube.U.S. aircraft have laid mines off Hong-Kong.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Mines weeping.24.   There have been no reports of enemy minelaying in Home Waters.In spite of bad weather, 58 ground mines were destroyed during the week inthe Normandy assault area.   The Caen canal is now open for coasters.An inshore channel from Havre to Dieppe, and another channel fromNewhaven to Dieppe are being swept.25. In the Mediterranean some 376 moored mines have been destroyed in the approaches to Marseilles and Toulon.The mine totals are 5,516 ground and 5,728 moored.26. Since the beginning of the war 171 British minesweeping vessels of allclasses have been lost in Home Waters leaving 947 in active service; in ForeignWaters, 66 have been lost leaving 547 in active service.Enemy Merchant Shipping.27. From the 1st to the 15th August, 17 enemy ships totalling 94,206 tons were sunk or captured or became total losses through Allied action. Two ships were sunk and three others seriously damaged in the Mediterranean.28. Photographic reconnaissance shows that the oil refinery ship OleWegger (12,201 tons) and the s.s. KariUsches Meer (6,864 tons) have beenscuttled in the Seine below Rouen.The Germans have announced that the Rostock (2,545 tons) arrived at Pasajesfrom the Gironde on the 28th August, and on the following day the Germanladen tanker Frisia (953 tons) arrived at Bilbao from Bordeaux.The German hospital ship Bordeaux was intercepted in the Channel on the1st and escorted into a British port for inspection.Finnish Merchant Shipping.29. The present strength of the Finnish Mercantile Fleet is about300,000 tons, almost all of Avhich has been available to the Germans. The amountof tonnage used for military and economic supplies to Finland (including german military supplies) is over 100,000 tons.   Although Germany might be able to
retain under her control a certain amount of the Finnish Merchant Fleet, theloss of the rest must aggravate Germany&apos;s shipping difficulties in the Baltic,particularly after S\veden&apos;s recent steps to stop war risk insurance on voyagesto German ports.MILITARY SITUATION.North-West Europe.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.30. During the past week the Allied armies in N.W. Europe have madespectacular advances, which have liberated the greater part of northern Franceand Belgium, and have brought them both here and south of the Ardennes tothe frontiers of Germany.12th U.S. Army Group.31. U.S. forces have developed twro thrusts during the week the onestriking east towards the Saar, and the other N.E. into Belgium in conformitywith the advance of the Second British Army.The Third U.S. Army, making the eastward thrust, reached Verdun on the31st and, on the following day, captured Sedan and secured a crossing over theMeuse in the area of St. Mihiel. On the 3rd, armoured forces reachedNeufehateau and Nancy. Since then news of this advance has been scanty, butunconfirmed reports state that U.S. forces are approaching Metz and have crossed the River Moselle against determined resistance in the Metz-Nancy area. Theyare also reported to have crossed the frontiers of Luxembourg.Further north, the First U.S. Army, operating on the right flank of theSecond British Army, were driving forward against patchy opposition over the historic battlefields of the 1914-1918 war. On the 1st, they reached the lineCompiegne-St. Just, and on the following day, mixed armoured and infantryforces, driving forward some 30 miles, won the distinction of being the first to cross the frontier of Belgium; this they did at 1100 on the 2nd, some 18 miles south of Avesnes. The next day leading forces captured Mons while, on the left of this thrust, other forces reached Valenciennes and the area due southof Tournai. On the 5th. Namur and Givet were liberated and U.S. forces disposedon the general line Tirlemont-Namur-Givet, made contact with British forcesin the area of Louvain.21st Army Group.32. At the beginning of this period British armoured forces, which wereracing for the Somme, had reached the Beauvais-Gournay area. During the30th/31st, after a brilliant night inarch, these forces reached Amiens and by lastlight on the 31st, armoured forces were across the Somme in strength. Duringthe course of this advance the tactical headquarters of the 7th German army was surprised at breakfast and captured intact Avith its maps and documents.Meanwhile, in the Canadian sector, Rouen was captured and troops of the1st Canadian Army pushed forward towards the Somme, while others were turnedtowards Dieppe, St. Valery and Le Havre. On the 1st, the 2nd canadian division re-entered Dieppe, scene of their exploits two years ago.By the 2nd, Arras, Douai, Albert and Lens had fallen to the Second british army, which, on the folowing day, entered and liberated Brussels after the mostdramatic and rapid advance of the war. Meanwhile, on their left, troops of theFirst Canadian Army had gained full possession of the Havre Peninsula exceptfor Le Havre itself and had reached the Somme at Abbeville, where they foundall but one of the bridges blown and the enemy showing some fight. these difficulties were, however, overcome and the Canadians moved up to the RiverCanche, where again the enemy put up a determined, if temporary, stand.By the 5th, the Second British Army had gone on to capture Antwerp, Ghentand Louvain. The docks at Antwerp are reported to be almost completelyundamaged and the bridge across the River Dyle at Louvain was captured intact.Meanwhile, the First Canadian Army continued its advance up the coast andis now on the general line Calais-St. Omer-Ah^e, although Boulogne, likeLe Havre, is still holding out.The capture of Antwerp and Ghent cut the enemy&apos;s escape route from the pas de Calais, and it is estimated that there may be between 100,000-150,000German troops cut off.[28162] B 2
In addition to this, large numbers of prisoners have come in daily during ourlightning advances, especially from the area S.W. of Mons where the Germanshung on too long and were trapped.Southern France.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)33. Operations in Southern France have develojjed with great rapidityduring the past week.. On the 29th, the foremost Allied troops had crossed theRhone E. of Lyons and reached Amberieu, whilst in the valley below Lyonsthey had ejected the enemy from Livron and Loriol and were closing in towardsValence.Valence fell on the 31st and Vienne on the 2nd and French and U.S. forces,working on both sides of the Rhone occupied Lyons on the 3rd. Meantime^reconnaissance columns had extended the range of their activities on the right flank and reached Chamousset, on the upper Isere, the Lac du Bourget, and a- small town close to the Swiss frontier west of Geneva. On the left the french had occupied St. Etienne.Beyond Lyons, thrusts have been made N.E. towards the Belfort Gap and north towards Dijon. Between the 3rd and the 6th the former has gained about100 miles and the latter about 75 miles. Leading units have pushed throughPontarlier and Lons-le-Saunier and are now 25 miles south of Belfort; theyare practically in the outskirts of Besancon and have cut the Besancon-Belfortroad.   Chalon-sur-Saone and Le Creusot were occupied on the 6th.On the Riviera flank, progress has been much hampered by minefields andthere was fighting before the River Var was crossed. Nice was occupied on the30th and patrols are now probing the hill country north of Monaco.Italy.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)34. The attack on the Adriatic sector in Italy has continued throughout theperiod. On the 31st, Canadian forces broke into the Gothic Line in the areaof Mcnteggio and considerable tank fighting then developed in the hilly countryto the north. In the meantime, on the coast, Polish troops had captured andcleaned up the town of Pesaro, and continued the advance along the coast.Progress was much hampered by mines.On the left flank of this coastal sector, British forces also broke into theGothic Line on the 31st, south of Mondiano and after bitter fighting againststubborn resistance, crossed the Conca River on the 4th.A general break through of the Gothic Line in this sector was thus accorn-plished. The advance northwards has continued, but against stiffening enemy resistance, for by now the Germans had appreciated that there was something inthe nature of a major attack going on. and had switched forces, particularlyarmoured forces, across country to meet it. By the 4th, the Canadians had captured Cattolica, on the coast, but here ran up against very stiff resistance put up by the enemy along the strongly held positions running from Abissinia toCoriano. The Canadians have made slight progress to the west of Riccione butstrong opposition is still being encountered, in Coriano, against which bothCanadian and British armour is being directed.Elsewhere along the front, British troops in the central sector have gainedfurther ground north of Bibbiena. and N.E. of Florence have thrust forward inthe general direction of the River Sieve.On the Fifth Army front, U.S. forces have advanced across the Arno,securing Pisa, Alto, Pascio, and, according to latest reports, reaching Prato andLucca.   The enemy has shown little disposition to resist.Russo-German Campaign.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)Central Sector.35. Between Warsaw and Lomza, the Russians have gained some ground in the face of tenacious German resistance.Southern Sector.36. The Russian advance in Rumania continues apace. The thrust south-wards has reached the line of the Danube and the Bulgarian frontier fromGiurgiu to the Black Sea. Ploesti and Bucharest have been taken, and russian troops have advanced westwards as far. as the Rumanian-Yugoslav frontier at
Turnu--Severin. They have evidently met little opposition, and the country in southern Rumania, offers few obstacles to rapid movement at this time of year.N.W. of Ploesti other Russian forces have crossed the Translyvanian Alpsand taken Brasov. This is of special interest, since it threatens the enemy&apos;s mostpromising defensive position on this part of the eastern front -the line of theCarpathians and the Transylvanian Alps.On the 5th, Russia declared war on Bulgaria, accusing that country of conducting pro-German activities behind a facade of neutrality. Some four hourslater &quot;the Bulgarians asked the Russians for an armistice.Yugoslavia.37. The Partisans have launched a large-scale offensive against rail and road communications in Croatia. The railways radiating south from Zagreb havebeen cut in numerous places and several road bridges destroyed. Aircraft of the balkan Air Force are co-operating with the Partisans.Partisan counter-attacks have taken advantage of moves of German forces from Montenegro to Serbia, and captured several important areas.To the east, clashes have occurred between Bulgarian and German troops inSerbia; the former have already made preparations to withdraw into their own country, but none have yet actually crossed the border.Greece.38. As a result of surrenders of German garrisons on the Pythion-Svilengrad railway and at the frontier post at the latter town, the &apos;&apos; neutral zone &quot; on the Turco-Greek border which had been held by the Germans is nowprobably completely controlled by Greek Andartes.There are many reports of troops from the enemy garrisons in the ^Egeanislands arriving on the mainland and also of movements north from thePeloponnese.Burma.Chin Hills and Chindwin.39. Our advance down the Imphal-Tiddim road has now reached the point17 miles south of the Assam-Burma border. Leading troops are thus only23 miles north of Tiddim.Advancing eastwards from Tamu, our troops occupied the village of Sittaung,on the Chindwin river, on the 4th.North Burma,40. Allied troops have continued their advance down the Myitkyina-Katharailway. They have now reached a point about half-way between Pinbaw andHop in.AIR SITUATION.General Review.41. Although offensive operations by Allied aircraft were restricted by weather conditions, full support was given to Allied troops in northern Franceand Belgium, heavy attacks being made on enemy communications and concen-trations.   In Germany, industrial targets were heavily bombed.Heavy attacks were made on enemy communications in Italy. In yugoslavia and Hungary, heavy bombers attacked railway centres and bridges, and long-range fighters very successfully attacked enemy airfields.United Kingdom.42. Flying-bomb attacks are reported under &quot; Enemy Activity and home security.&quot; On the night of the lst/2nd, two enemy aircraft, the lower parts ofcomposite aircraft, crashed in this country.Home Waters.43.

A total of 17,230 sorties was flown during the week and 17,978 tons of bombs were dropped.Enemy long-range bomber activity was again on a low scale and the targetsappeared to have been tactical targets in the neighbourhood of our advancedtroops. Long-range reconnaissance continued on its normal low scale. By the3rd September, all G.A.F. close-support fighter units were withdrawn from northern France and Belgium and, with the exception of a few- units remaining in Holland, the whole force is now based in Germany with the main concentrationprobably in the Ruhr. The scale of effort was low throughout the week and didnot exceed 130 sorties on any one day. The night-fighter effort was on an equallylow scale.Enemy losses in combat were 41 aircraft destroyed and four damaged; 45Allied bombers and 66 fighters and fighter-bombers are missing.Northern France and the Loio Countries.45. Offensive operations were again considerably restricted by unfavourable weather conditions, but the fullest possible support was given to Allied troops by heavy attacks on enemy communications and concentrations.The damage caused to enemy transport was again very considerable. Forexample, on the 1st, fighter-bombers and fighters destroyed about 2,100 M.T. andother vehicles and damaged a further 1.100. On the 3rd, the totals were 2,150destroyed&quot; and 340 damaged. During the week, large numbers of tanks,locomotives and barges and several bridges were destroyed.Enemy concentrations at Brest were attacked on five days and at Havre ontw-o. Nearly 4.000 tons of bombs were dropped on the former and 3,300 tons onthe latter, good results being achieved. About 70 tons were dropped on troop concentrations in the Abbeville area. Gun batteries in the lie de Cezembre, offSt. Malo. were bombed on the 31st, 910 tons of bombs and many containers ofincendiary material being dropped with good effect.Nearly 3,300 tons of bombs were dropped on seven airfields in Holland and2,900 tons on eight flying-bombs supply depots in the Pas de Calais. successful attacks were also made on a number of fuel dumps.Germany.46. Daylight attacks were made on several targets in Germany. two attacks were made on Ludwigshafen, on which about 1,600 tons of bombs were dropped through cloud, Pathfinder technique being employed. Emden was bombed in clear weather, 580 tons being dropped. A good concentration of bombing was achieved and the target area was left well ablaze with black smokerising to 10,000 feet. Among the targets hit in the docks was a 9,000-ton ship.Four-hundred-and-seventy tons were dropped on Karlsruhe railway centre and464 tons on aero-engine and armaments works at Stuttgart, both targets beingbombed in clear weather with good results.At night, a total of 209 Mosquitoes bombed Dusseldorf, Bremen, Karlsruhe,Hanover, Hamburg, Cologne and Leverkusen.Mediterranean Front.47. During the week ended dawn on the 5th, Allied aircraft of the M.A.A.F-.fleAv a total of 11,985 sorties, of which 2,618 (23 missing) were by heavy bombers;9,576 tons of bombs were dropped. 91 Allied aircraft are missing and 36 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Very little Allied air activity was called for in the South of France. In Italysupport was provided for Allied ground forces and heavy attacks were madeon enemy communications. In Yugoslavia and Hungary the Strategic Air Forcemainly bombed railway targets; long-range fighters very successfully attacked enemy aircraft on the ground and, in Yugoslavia, enemy lines of communication.
South of France.48. Fighter-bombers attacked enemy transport and communications; anumber of M.T. and locomotives were destroyed and railway tracks cut,particularly in the Lyons area.  A total of 153 sorties was flown by these aircraft.Italy.49. Heavy attacks, by all types of bombers, were made on enemy communica-tions; particular attention was paid to rail and road bridges and railway centres.In daylight, heavy bombers dropped about 1,050 tons on these targets. As aresult of these operations the viaduct at Avisio and the Casarsa railway bridgewere partly destroyed, and much damage done to the railway centres at Ora,Bronzolo and Trento. At night mixed forces of heavies and Wellingtons dropped765 tons on the railway centres at Ferrara, Bologna and Ravenna.Similar operations were carried out by other bombers causing severe damage and resulting in many bridges being hit; on the 4th and 5th at least 26 bridgeswere hit. In the eastern sector heavy attacks were made on enemy gun positions, dumps and transport leading up to the battle area. At least 230 unitsof rolling stock, a similar number of M.T. and 32 locomotives were destroyed; inaddition a large number of similar transport units were damaged. In these operations medium, light and fighter-bombers flew a total of 3,621 sorties for theloss of 20 aircraft.Every night, an average of some 45 to 50 light bombers attackedcommunications, harbours and shipping, barracks and other buildings. On one night, during a patrol, Beaufighters shot down four Ju. 87.Heavy bombers attacked the harbour and shipping at Genoa (438 tons); a destroyer and two U-boats were damaged and numerous small vessels sunk. very heavy damage was done to dry docks, workshops and buildings. Other bombersmade frequent attacks on shipping; a 9,000-ton ship was hit amidships, severalsmaller vessels, patrol boats and barges sunk and a further number damaged.South-Eastern Europe.50. Long-range fighters were most successful in attacks on enemy airfields in yugoslavia and Hungary.

Good concentrations of bombing were affected at nearly all the rail centres attacked and many bridges were hit; anumber of the latter were partly destroyed, including the railway bridge atSzeged, the road and rail bridge at Pancevo, two bridges over the Sava river andthe rail bridge at Karlovac. In N.W. Rumania, the rail centre at Oradea was attacked. The ferry slips at Smederovo (25 miles S.E. of Belgrade) were bombed and both the road and rail terminals totally destroyed; the train ferry was dive-bombed by 40 Lightnings.

Twelve allied aircraft were lost and 25 enemy1 aircraft were destroyed. Transport aircraft flew 163 sorties, carrying 254 tons.A high proportion of Allied.air activity was directed on targets in theHengyang area; the town itself and the airfield were attacked with good results,and in this area many roads, bridges, stores and buildings were severely damaged.A heavy attack was made on the railway yards at Yochow; during this operation16 enemy aircraft were shot down. Other good attacks were made on the railway centre at Sinyang (120 miles N. of Hankow), and Tangyang (150 miles W. ofHankow). In the course of the week, about 300 enemy M.T. vehicles were destroyed and a number of rivercraft, including some large steamers, were eithersunk or damaged. Mines were laid in Hong Kong harbour and in the estuariesof the Pearl and Yangtze rivers. Mines were also laid in Takao harbour(Formosa), where large concentrations of shipping were attacked.Enemy aircraft made a low-level attack on the Burma road in the Lunglingarea, and attacked a number of Allied airfields; no important damage has beenreported.Pacific.New Guinea and Halmahera.54:. Allied air activity in Dutch New Guinea was largely directed againstBabo, Ransiki, Utarom and other airfields. Among other objectives wereManokwari, where several dumps were destroyed and at least three loaded bargessunk, the Geelvink Bay area, where villages were bombed and machine-gunnedand the McCluer Gulf area, where a fuel dump was destroyed, a coaster seton fire and other small craft sunk or damaged.In British New Guinea, attacks were again made on enemy troops, fueldumps and gun positions in the Wewak, Dagua and Boram areas and onirr,;-,.;^,, t-t^^aTargets in Halmahera, which were attacked by Liberators and Mitchells,included stores and A.A. gun positions at Wasile Bay, on which 90 tons of bombs were dropped, and Tobelo, where several buildings were destroyed and a smallship sunk. Another small ship was sunk in Kau Bay and a medium-sized ship was seriously damaged off the west coast.Neiv Britain, New Ireland and Bouaainville.55.

As a result of the Bomber Command daylight attackon the 27th August, the main concentration of damage has been caused in the synthetic oil plant. Buildings affected include the distillation plant, the watergas plant, a contact oven house, a cooling tower, the ILS removal boxes and someunidentified buildings.Karlsruhe marshalling yard.-Although large portions of the target area are obscured by the smoke of fires still raging, it can be seen that the U.S.A.A.F.attack of the 5th September has caused severe damage to the marshalling yardand repair shops.In the marshalling yard, nearly all tracks in the sorting, storage and holdingsidings, have been cut in many places and a large number of wagons destroyed or damaged. The transhipment shed and the wagon repair shop have both been destroyed.All buildings in the repair shops have suffered heavily, the engine round-house being destroyed and many tracks disrupted.The through lines have been cut north and west of the marshalling yardand there is considerable business and residential damage in the town.Kiel. As a result of the Bomber Command attack on the 26th/27th August,severe damage was caused to installations in the eastern port area, including thenaval dockyard and arsenal, the torpedo fitting-out quay, the marine store depotand the munitions depot. Haze and part-cloud cover prevent detailed assessment,but it can be seen that plate sheds, erecting shops, smitheries, engine shops and numerous large and small buildings have all suffered severe damage.
Konigsberg. Damage resulting from the Bomber Command attacks on the26th/27th and 29th/30th August is very heavy. Photographs show the weightof the first attack to have fallen on the eastern parts of the town and 20 buildings in the barracks were severely damaged. The weight of the second attack fell inthe closely built-up area in the centre of the town. The castle and State theatreare burnt out. Damage in the main goods station is severe and two buildings inthe railway wagon works are destroyed. At least 44 warehouses on the banks ofthe Pregel have been gutted or destroyed.Stettin. As a result of the attack by Bomber Command on the 29th/30thAugust, a large area of the town has been destroyed by fire, spreading from thecentre northwards and including the Grunhof district. South of the town centreone fire was still burning three days after the attack. Damage to property in the dock area includes the Stettiner Oderwerke shipbuilding yard.Stuttgart. Smoke from fires still burning obscure the north-west of theDaimler Benz Works (D.B. aero-engines and Daimler Benz headquarters), butsevere and widespread damage can be seen in the south-east as a result of theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 5th September. Among the many buildings affected arethe power plant, heat treatment and press shop, final assembly shop, sub-assemblyshop, foundries, workshops and stores buildings. Many of these buildings havebeen almost or wholly destroyed and in all cases the damage is severe. There is some scattered residential damage in the area surrounding the works.Holland.Soesterberg Airfield. As a result of the attack by Bomber Command aircraft on the 3rd September, two hangars (one of which had been previously damaged)have been destroyed and two probable workshops severely damaged.
