(44) 507.7th September, 1944.WAR CABINET.SUEZ  CANAL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 8th November, 1943, the War Cabinet had before them a paper on thefuture of the Suez Canal (W.P. (43) 491) and decided that consideration of thequestions raised should be deferred (Conclusions 151 (43)). Since that date thequestion has been further discussed interdepartmentally and a revised paper is annexed hereto.2.   The present position is unsatisfactory in three main points (a) The Suez Canal Companv&apos;s concession terminates in 1968 and the Canalthen falls lock, stock and barrel into Egyptian hands. Only the rightof His Majesty&apos;s Government to take measures to safeguard the canal and the detailed provisions for the neutralisation of the Canal willsurvive.(b) The predominant French share in the direction of the Canal Companyhas enabled the French in the past to intrigue with the egyptian government, and may again prove an embarrassment to British policy.(c) Our specific rights under the Treaty of Alliance to facilities on Egyptiansoil to protect the Suez Canal are not secured beyond 1957.3. We shall therefore be faced within a comparatively short time with thetermination of some of the legal rights upon which our whole position in the suez Canal area is based. It will, I think, be agreed that there may be morefavourable opportunities to come to terms with Egypt, concerning the defence and administration of the Canal, in the immediate post-war settlements than at anytime thereafter. It is for this reason that I again bring the question to the noticeof my colleagues.4. Another point is that with the liberation of Paris the present emergency arrangements for administering the Canal through the British Directors,^will come to an end. Control will gradually pass back to the French and definition of our long-term policy will be valuable in guiding our action in this transition period.5. The issues to be considered in formulating our policy and determiningour course of action are complex. My suggestion is that a small Committee ofMinisters closely concerned should be asked to go into them and report to theWar Cabinet as soon as convenient.A. E,Foreign Office, 7th September, 1944.
ANNEX.The object of this paper is to state the present position and to formulateon broad lines future policy concerning the distinct, though closely connected,questions of (a) the military defence, and(b) the administration of the Suez Canal.Interdepartmental discussions have revealed unanimity upon the future policy to be pursued concerning defence, but not concerning administration.Military Defence.2. The Suez Canal Convention of 1888 provides that the Canal shall be free and open in time of war, as well as in time of peace, to every vessel ofcommerce or of war without distinction of flag; the Canal shall never beblockaded and though belligerent warships may pass through the Canal, no act of war may be committed in the Canal area. No Power may embark or disembarktroops or&apos;materials of war in the Canal area. Under the Convention thethe Egyptian Government is to take measures for the execution of the suez canal Convention, but if the Egyptian Government does not possess sufficientresources it is to call upon the Ottoman Government to assist it. The provisionsabout committing acts of hostility, embarking or disembarking troops, &amp;c, arenot to interfere with the measures taken by the Egyptian or Ottoman &quot;Govern-ments to safeguard the Canal and to ensure fulfilment of the provisions of theConvention or with measures for the defence of Egypt Egypt and the ottoman empire could therefore station troops and warships in the Canal area underthe Convention. When Turkey came into the war of 1914-18 Great Britaindeclared .a protectorate over Egypt and claimed to succeed to all the rights ofthe Ottoman Government with regard to the protection of the Canal, a claim which was recognised in the Peace Treaties (Article 152 of the Treaty ofVersailles). In 1922. when by unilateral declaration of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment Egypt became independent. His Majesty&apos;s Government made reservationsintended to cover inter alia the right to defend Egypt and the Canal.3. Although responsibility for the defence of the Canal is thus vested inHis Majesty&apos;s Government jointly with the Egyptian Government, the Conven-tion makes no provision for the measures by which the CanaFs defence is in factto be secured.   Under the Treaty of Alliance of 1936. however, Egypt is bound (a) in time of war, imminent menace of war or apprehended national emer-gency, to furnish us with all the facilities and assistance in their power;(b) to authorise us at all times to station forces in Egypt in accordance withdetailed arrangements contained in an annex to Article 8 of theTreaty for the purpose of ensuring the defence of the Canal in co-operation with the Egyptian forces. This obligation is limited,however, to a period of 20 years certain and its continuance there-after is subject to review.* The detailed arrangements are inade-quate in certain respects and, in particular, do not provide for themaintenance of naval facilities at Alexandria.The Egyptian Government have, on the whole, co-operated with us well in imple-menting the defence provisions of the Treaty of Alliance during the present war.A administration.4. The Suez Canal Company is an Egyptian Company holding a concessionfrom the Egyptian Government which expires in 1968.   Under the Statutes.* Article 8 of the Treaty of Alliance with Egypt provides:  &quot; It is understood that at the end of the period of twenty years specified in Article 16the question whether the presence of British forces is no longer necessary owing to the factthat the Egyptian Army is in a position to ensure by its own resources the liberty and entiresecurity of navigation of the Canal may, if the High Contracting Parties do not agreethereon, be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for decision in accordancewith the provisions of the Covenant in force at the time of signature of the present treaty or to such other person or bqdy -of persons for decision in accordance with such otherprocedure as the High Contracting Parties may agree.&quot;
however, the administrative centre of the Company is in Paris. The staff ofthe Company in Egypt are predominantly of French nationality, there is a large majority of French Directors on the Board (19 against 10 British), and by^ aspecial provision French law is applicable to &quot; sa constitution comme societeet les rapports des associes entre eux.&quot; It is, moreover, an undertaking of whichthe French are exceedingly proud and to which they will cling tenaciously.Though His Majesty&apos;s Government hold some 44 per cent of the share capital,the voting power attached to this holding is insignificant and private Britishholdings are inconsiderable.5. Since January 1942 the British Directors have administered theCompany under emergency powders conferred on them by the French Directors,while British arms have ensured the safety of the Canal itself. The BritishDirectors have exercised effective control ever since the collapse of France, butup to January 1942 the French Directors were still nominally in charge and did,indeed, issue some instructions. The legal position of the present British control is insecure because there is some doubt as to the validity of the powers secretlyconferred on the London Directors by the Board in France. When it againbecomes possible for the French Directors to exercise their functions, as theywill certainly claim to be able to do when the enemy has been driven out of paris, the powers conferred on the London Directors will, in any case, lapseand Paris again become the administrative centre of the Company.6. The position, therefore,&quot; has been, up to now7, that while the actualoperation of the Canal is conducted by a Company predominantly French, theGovernments which have the right to defend the Canal are the Egyptian Govern-ment and His Majesty&apos;s Government. Up to the present time the fact thatthe operation of the Canal has been in predominantly French hands, whereas the right to defend it is predominantly in British hands, has not given rise to serious difficulties, but this may not always prove to be the case in the future.British Objectives.7. The Canal is a vital imperial communication, as can be seen from thefact that before the war roughly six out of every ten ships using the Canal were british.   The major British objectives, therefore, are that (a) responsibility for the defence of the Canal should be vested in HisMajesty&apos;s Government in perpetuity;(b) Canal duties should be fixed at the lowest rate compatible with efficient administration and with a reasonable return to the shareholders.LH-ALlCllllJl J- ICttOUl V(c) the Canal should be so administered as to facilitate the exercise of HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s defence responsibilities. It is further desir-able that the British Empire should have a share in the management and control of the administration consistent with its predominantposition in the area and as the greatest user of the Canal.Future Policy.8. There is general agreement that to safeguard our user of the Canal theInternational Convention of 1888 should be replaced by a new international convention. The existing Convention is in any case out of date and many of its provisions lack reality. The new Convention should contain a provision thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government as trustee for the United Nations should, togetherwith the Egyptian Government, be responsible in perpetuity for the defence ofthe Canal and be guarantors for the enforcement of the terms of the Convention.Such a provision would not only affirm the special responsibility of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in relation to defence of the Canal, but would make His Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ responsibility for defence a general one and not one limited&apos;to giving aid to the Egyptian Government when called upon, as is the presentposition under Article 9 of the Convention. This alteration of our responsibilities would be of great importance, for it would enable us to insist upon permanent arrangements with the Egyptian Government similar to the temporary arrange-ments in the 1936&apos; Treaty of Alliance, which would enable us, even in times ofpeace, to take specific measures for the defence of the Canal. It is evident that without permanent arrangements under which British forces may be stationedon Egyptian soil, we shall have no long-term safeguard of the British positionin the Canal area.
9. The new &quot;Convent ion would also clarify and extend the existing provisions which govern the use of the Canal by merchant shipping. The Canal would, asat present provided, always be free&apos; and open in peace and war for merchantvessels and warships without distinction of flag. Additional provisions wouldbe necessary, however, to ensure (a) efficient maintenance of the Canal, and(b) direct protection for the users of the Canal as regards the level of duessubject to a reasonable return Lo shareholders (cf., the Panama CanalTreaty with the United States and the provisions of the VersaillesTreaty regarding the Kiel Canal).10. As regards the administration of the Canal any policy must take intoconsideration the facts (a) that in 1968, if the concession is not prolonged byagreement, the undertaking falls, almost literally lock, stock and barrel, into thehands of the Egyptian Government, and (b) that some uncommonly solid induce-ment, or threat, or argument is accordingly required to induce the Egyptians to forgo this advantage (the Company only obtain an indemnity for &quot; 1&apos;abandonde son materiel et des objets mobiliers &quot;) and, what is perhaps even more relevant,to overcome their nationalistic ambitions, which asserted themselves with incon-venient violence in this connexion as long ago as 1910. The following is an extractfrom a Foreign Office memorandum recording the incident : &quot; The proposal [for the prolongation of the concession] was undoubtedlyprofitable to Egypt.....Nevertheless, Nationalist passions were aroused bothamong the public and the General Assembly; the Prime Minister, BoutrosGhali, was assassinated, and although the draft agreement was sponsored by the Khedive and Zaghlul Pasha, then Minister of Justice, the general assembly turned it down with contumely.&quot; During the abortive treatydiscussions between Lord Curzon and Aclly Pasha in 1921 the question againcame under discussion, but the Egyptian Government rejected the proposals put forward on that occasion by His Majesty:s Government largely on theground that &quot;any mention of the subject in the treaty would be fatal toits reception in Egypt.&quot;11.   The following appear to be the possible courses of action :  (a) To permit the restoration of the status que ante June 1940, to clear theCompany of enemy influence, and then to combine with the french in endeavouring to negotiate with the Egyptian Government aprolongation of the concession to the Company as at present con-stituted. The disadvantages of this policy are that it offers little hope of success so far as the negotiation is concerned (short, that isto say, of forcible methods) : that it does not secure to British interestsa share of administration consistent with their position as the predominant user of the Canal; and that it would leave the operationof the Canal largely in French hands which, in certain circumstances,might constitute a danger to our security. On the other hand, thiscourse avoids the serious financial complications of the alternativesbelow.(b) Another course which has been suggested is the cancellation of the concession to the existing Company and the grant of a concession fora more extended period to a company differently constituted andtechnically Egyptian, in which French participation would be diminished and British-Egyptian participation increased. As thiswould require the existing French-controlled company to give up their rights for the remainder of the concession, the political andfinancial difficulties would obviously be considerable.(c) The conversion of the present Canal Company into a public utilityservice on the general ground thafjTan undertaking of this magnitudeand international importance ought no longer to continue to be inthe hands of a profit-making concern. If this policy were adopted,the revised Convention referred to in paragraph 8 would provide thatthe operation of the Canal should be entrusted to a public utilityservice. Assuming that His Majesty&apos;s Government had secured inthe convention the responsibility for the defence of the Canal, therewould be an argument for the public utility service being brought under predominantly British, or, at any rate, Anglo-Egyptian con-trol.   Alternatively,   the   concession   should   be   regranted   to   an
international body representative of the maritime United Nations, whowould confirm the present French staff as Managers in order to reduce their natural hostility to any interference with their prospects. this solution falls short of the full attainment of British preponderance,at any rate in peace-time, but it would be reasonable that when theUnited Kingdom was made jointly responsible for defence, HisMajesty&apos;s Government should be given power jointly with theEgyptian Government to insist on the Canal&apos;s offices and workshopsbeing so staffed as not to jeopardise the safety of the Canal in warand to have a say in future appointments. It, perhaps, offers thebest hope of overcoming (a) French insistence on something very likethe status quo ante, and (b) Egyptian nationalistic ambition. NeitherFrance nor Egypt could easily hold out against a solution representingthe general will of the United Nations, on which they would, of course,be consulted. There would remain the financial difficulty ofproviding the compensation that could fairly be claimed by the shareholders, &amp;c, in respect of the period up to 1968. The presentvalue, as in 1946, of net profits for the remainder of the concessionperiod on the basis of those earned during the last five years before1939 would be in the neighbourhood of  80 million. A claim would nodoubt also be made by the Egyptian Government for compensation for loss of the dues which could be charged after 1968. It is not possibleto estimate what the Egyptians might ask for, but on the assumptionthat they might charge as dues the utmost that the traffic would bear,this claim too would be likely to be substantial. We could not afford to provide capital sums to compensate existing shareholders or to meetan Egyptian claim. A solution would therefore have to be sought in the form of e.g. the preservation of the existing Company and the cession of its rights to the new public utility service in return for ashare in the profits, and the grant of a further share in the profits tothe Egyptian Government. It might, however, be possible to settle the Egyptian claim by other means, e.g., as part of a bargain overCyrenaica.12. The third alternative (c) appears to promise the best &quot;chance of successfulnegotiation, but would involve serious financial complications. The problem ofour position in the Canal area must, as has been explained, be faced within acomparatively few years, and the question for decision is whether a settlement onan international basis at the end of the present hostilities on the lines of alternative (c) should be our objective, or whether the difficulties of this solutionare so great that we must adopt alternative (a) (status quo ante) with suchimprovements as we may be able to negotiate.
