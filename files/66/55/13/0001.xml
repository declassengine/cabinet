BRIDGESOffices of the War Cabinet,10TH september,   1944*ASSISTANCE TO WARSAWReport by the Vice-Chief of the Air StaffIn view of continued strong representations by thePolish military authorities, the Air Staff have had under examination with the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Bomber Command, the feasibility of a large-scale nightoperation by heavy bombers from the United Kingdom toWarsaw, aircraft landing in Italy.Polish requestsRequests received from the Poles have included:(a) requests for bombing operations against german-held objectives in the city or,alternatively airfields in the vicinity of the City, and (b) supply operations.

Size of operation the number of heavy bombers that can be employed onthis  operation is limited by the availabilitj   of containersand by reception arrangements in Italy where only a certainnumber of aircraft can be handled,,    A further consideration is the diversion of a considerable force from the strategicoffensive or support of the land battle since it is probablethat the aircraft engaged will be unavailable for other employment for at least a week.    The heavy bomber force is at the disposal of S.G,A,E.P,  and this concurrence inthis diversion would be necessary,.Taking these various factors into account, the airStaff assess the limit of the strength which could been gaged at 120 aircraft.    C.-in-C. Bomber Command statesthat he considers the operation technically feasible though he estimates probable casualties at 10)o to 15,- and subjectto weather conditions the earliest date as the night ofI2th/I3th September owing to light condiuions-.    For this tobe achieved a decision is necessary today as distribution ofcontainers takes 48 hours.Bombing Operations(i) The results to be achieved by an attempted attack by heavy bombers at night on distant airfields are highlyproblematical.    Even if weather conditions were sufficientlyfavourable to permit the location of the objectives the weight of bombs that could be employed within the limits of aircraft available would be insufficient to achieve anysubstantial results,    American heavy formations attackingan airfield by daylight would not anticipate effectiveresults with less than 60 aircraft employed,    Results wouldbe still less by night;    any diversion against airfieldsby night would therefore be waste of effort(ii) The Polish Staff suggest that a bombing attack onWarsaw city simultaneous with the delivery of supplies would force the Germans to take cover and thereby facilitatemovement on the part of the Poles including action to recoversupply containers.    Bomber Command have stated that bombsdirected against f-fc jeetivee in the city by night must beexpected to fall in Polish as well as in German areas?-a TheAir Staff consider that the capacity which it would be practicable to allocate to bombs within the total forceemployed would be insufficient to achieve a diversionaryeffect sufficient to compensate for the corresponding reduction    in the number of supply containers that couldbe carried.    Moreover there are tactical difficulties inconnection with the timing of the bombing in relation tothe arrival of the supply containers on the ground involving the splitting of the bomber force and the provision of twosets of marker aircraft all of which militate against the,general success of the supply operation^(iii) The understandings that exist with the Russians thatwe will co-ordinate with them all bombing operations in thevicinity of their advance in the Balkans.- and a similarundertaking by the Americans that their own shuttle operationwithin a 100 miles of the Russian front will be co-ordinatedin advance, would make it necessary for us to get agreementwith the Russians over any British bombing in Warsaw.    this at best would involve delay.

The Air Staff are therefore of the opinion that thesubstitution of bombs for containers would on the wholebe disadvantageous.Supply droppingC.-in-C. Bomber Command regards supply droppingfrom low altitude as altogether unacceptable.    thus the operation must be carried out from about 10 thousandfeet.    Estimates are conjectural as to the proportionof containers which would, from that haight, land withinthe city area and in any case would be greatly dependentupon prevailing weather conditions.    Any inaccuracy inthe meteorological forecasting of the average windstrength throughout the dropping height will have considerable effect and it is by no means improbable that the whole delivery would miss the target.    the americans have estimated that in a day operation from10 thousand feet some lCfs of containers might .be expectedto arrive in the general area of Warsaw city.    bomber command have estimated between 5^ and 20% according toweather conditions.    If a somewhat optimistic mean is adopted at 12, 5/ this means that 192 containers out ofa total of 1540 would arrive in the city area.    Thisequals 17 tons of stores delivered in the city.   -On information given by S.O.E.  as to the pick-upto be expected in the area outside complete Polish controland on a consideration of the areas held or partly dominated by the Germans,  the conclusion is that only 55% equallingsome 10 tons might arrive in Polish hands out of the quantities delivered in the city.Situation in Wars awAll the above factors have been represented to and discussed with the Polish Air jStaff at various meetings atthe Air Ministry and it does not seem that the general conclusions of the Air Staff as to the difficulties of delivery of supplies are seriously disputed by them though they still favour the inclusion of some bombing.    Theimportant outstanding issue is the effect which could beexpected from the&apos;delivery of 10 tons of supplies to thedefenders of Warsaw plus further small infiltraticins ofpick-up from the countryside.     &quot;The Polish Staff suggestthat 10 tons might sustain the defence for a week;    on theother hand they state that the defence is so hard-pressedthat if a large scale operation Is not conducted tonightthe defence may well collapse.It has throughout been stated by c.-in-C. Bomber -Command that the first night on which an operation toWarsaw would be tactically feasible is the night of12/13th September.    Taking this into account and rememberingthat the original Polish estimate of supply requirementswas 7 tons per night, the Air Staff are of the opinion thatthe results which can reasonably be expected from a bomber command supply operation can under the circumstances have no material effect on the outcome of the battle in Warsaw.They consider that the operation, is militarily unjustifiable.(Signed)    D.C.S.
