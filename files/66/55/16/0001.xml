THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 516.14*A September, 1944SCHEME- FOR PURCHASE BY BRITISH SHIPOWNERS OF NEWVESSELS BUILT ON GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT.Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport.AS the outcome of earlier papers W.P. (G) (40) 216 of the 15th August,1940, and W.P. (G) (40) 266 of the 17th October, 1940-War Cabinet approvalwas given to a scheme under which my Ministry enters into agreements with british shipowmers for the sale of Government-owned ships to replace losses inwar-time. The sales will not actually take place, until the conclusion either ofan armistice with Germany or an armistice with Japan, at the Ministers option.Cmd. 6357 contains details of the scheme.A substantial number of Purchase Agreements has been completed, but the uncertainty wdiich is inevitably created in the shipping industry by the prospectof a large surplus of American war-time tramp tonnage leads many owners tohesitate before committing themselves to take over vessels of this type. Othertonnage is being readily taken. In these circumstances I am of opinion thatsome widening of the scope of the scheme would be advisable, apart from some minor technical adjustments wdiich I have recently authorised.2. Tramps.(a) In addition to losses by war or marine risk, or by Government acquisition,I propose that obsolescence should be a ground for admitting a claim to thepurchase of a Government ship. In view of the duration of the war, an increasing-number of vessels must undoubtedly be scrapped on the termination of hostilities,as their economic life is ended, and availability of new Government tonnage will assist this desirable end. The Ministry will adjudicate on obsolescence in thelight of the circumstances of each ship. It will be a condition that the obsoletevessel should be scrapped, unless put to a use of which the Ministry approves.(b) If, after the above extension of the scheme, tramps still remainundistributed, it is proposed to offer them to any British interests which may wishto enter into the shipping industry.3. Coasting Tankers.War-time requirements have necessitated the construction of a considerablenumber of coasting tankers on Ministry account, with the result that the numbersat present available are in excess of actual losses. In view of the importance ofsmall tankers in the shipping industry and the desirability of widening thepresent group of owners, I propose that any existing British owner desirous of acquiring small tankers will be allowed to opt for this type of tanker. If allcoasting tankers are not disposed of as the result of the foregoing relaxation, theyshould be offered to any British company not under foreign financial control whichmay wish to purchase.[28215]Copy no war CABINET.x )28th Cons.  Min.  8.
4. General.In addition to the foregoing, it is proposed that the following generalrelaxation should be allowed in respect of all classes of tonnage :  The present scheme does not allow vessels to be resold within a period ofthree years after the date of delivery, except with the sanction of the Minister.This restriction is desirable on foreign sales, but there would be no strong reasonagainst sales to British buyers (if necessary, at a price not exceeding the costunder the scheme, less depreciation) at any time after the general requisitioning of British tonnage comes to an end, and subject to the continuance or otherwise of the war-time Transfer Restriction (Shipping and Aircraft) Act.L.Ministry of War Transport, W. 1.14/7; September, 1944.
