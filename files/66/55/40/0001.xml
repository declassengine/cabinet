fl      ill     &apos;K   -    ..,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT   ^ 0  Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET.Copy No. &quot;W.P. (44) 540.&apos;23rd September, 1944.WAR CABINET.INTERNATIONAL AIR CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.1. In his Memorandum (W.P. (44) 530) of the 19th September, theSecretary of State for Air recommends acceptance of the American invitation toan International Conference on Civil Air Transport to begin on the 1st November.2. Since this Memorandum was circulated the Australian Government (in telegram No. 243 to the Dominions Office and the New Zealand Government) has put forward suggestions with which we are in agreement.   They are : (i) Develop intra-Commonwealth air services.(ii) Extend the pattern of intra-Commonwealth air services in collaboration with foreign countries. This would face the United States with a planned system of regulated international air routes.3.   Australia (i) Resists the narrow objectives outlined by the United States for theproposed Conference,(ii) Emphasises the necessity for a Commonwealth meeting on an official level before the International Conference,(iii) Proposes that such a meeting should be held in Canberra,(vi) Suggests that we ask the United States to postpone the international conference till December,(v) Wishes to inform the United States that we are not going to be stam-peded into an International Conference on lines with which we are infundamental disagreement.4. Now if we decide, instead of following the Australian plan, to go to washington with a Commonwealth Meeting of officials on the way, we shall be launched upon an International Conference in the United States with no prospectof agreement on the wider objectives. The Meeting in Ottawa, at an official level,would have neither time nor opportunity to develop a Commonwealth programme which, in any case, would have to be endorsed by the respective Governments.5. Alternatively, if we hold a Commonwealth meeting in Canberra withMr. Howe attending it beyond the shadow of Mr. Mackenzie King, we might expect to develop concerted plans for Commonwealth air routes and exert a com-bined influence which would enable us to stand up before the United States andin front of the World.6.   I ask the Cabinet to endorse Australia&apos;s proposals (i) We should seek from the United States of America a postponement ofthe International Conference.(ii) We should agree to an official level Commonwealth meeting at Canberrain mid-October.B.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1,23rd September, 1944.[28271]
