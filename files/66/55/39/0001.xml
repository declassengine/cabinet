A heavy attack was made on Kiel on the 26th/27thAugust (see Prints Nos. 6 and 7). Many buildings in the munitions depot atMonkeberg were completely burnt out and a large area of the Naval dockyardwas gutted. Attacks were also made on Darmstadt and Russelsheim, wherenight photographs taken an hour after the attack showed large fires burningthroughout the Opel Works.2. Naval Targets.The U-boat pens at Brest were attacked with 12,000 lb. bombs on the13th August (see Print No. 8) and block-ships at the same port were bombedseveral times (see Print No. 9). In an attack on the U-boat pens at La Paliiceheavy damage was caused to the roof of the pens (see Print No. 10). Eight air-craft very successfully attacked the E-.ancl R-boat pens at Ijmuiden with12.000 lb. bombs, two of which penetrated the roof. Print No. 11 shows the hitsscored on the pens. In a concentrated attack on Emden on the 6th Septemberbombs were seen to straddle the dock installations of the inner harbour.!5. Railway Centres.Prints Nos. 12 to 14 show the results of attacks made on the marshalling yards at Somain, Lens and Givors on the 11th and 11th/12th August.4. Enemy Positions and Other Military Targets in France.During the first part of the period attacks were made on enemy concentra-tions in the Falaise and Potigny areas to pave the way for an advance by armyunits.

5. Oil Plants.The attack on the oil plant at Homberg (Meerbeck) on the 27th August wasmoderately successful, and that on Sterkrade Holten, on the 18th/19th August,achieved considerable success and this plant was again rendered inactive. the fertiliser site was completely demolished, and the contact oven house, at whichrepairs had just been completed, received several direct hits. An attack on thesame night on Rieme destroyed three of a group of four oil storage tanksalongside the canal and many of the smaller oil tanks on the west edge of the target were also destroyed.6. A irfields.Attacks were made on nine enemy airfields on the 15th August, forming part of a combined operation carried out m conjunction with the United StatesEighth Air Force against a total of twenty airfields. These attacks were intendedto reduce the fighting efficiency of the G.A.F. with special attention to the nightfighters. They were all successfully carried out, runways were renderedtemporarily unserviceable and craters were seen throughout the airfields.Similar attacks were made on the 3rd September on six airfields in Hollandwhere enemy close support units which had been driven out of North France andBelgium were stationed. Photographs show that heavy destruction was achieved at all the airfields.C. Sea Mining.Minelaying during the period was planned to interfere with the movements of enemy shipping and U-boats through the Western and Central Baltic and to embarrass the retreat of shipping from the French, Belgian and Dutch ports and bases. Mines were laid in Kiel Bay, the Cadet Channel, the approaches toSwinemunde, the Stettin/Swinemunde Canal, Danzig Bay, the approaches toPillau and the Pillau. Konisberg Canal. On the 29th August, this canal was closed to traffic for two days and on the 31st August was closed again, as also werethe ports of Pillau and Danzig.
