THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  September 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 529.l*dth September, 1944.WAR CABINET.FUTURE OF B.O.A.C. :  NEED FOR AN EARLY DECISION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.IN my memorandum of the 27th May (W.P. (44) 268), I examined at some length the problem of how best to arrange for the operation of our overseas air services after the war, and recommended that the British Overseas airways corporation should continue to be the chosen instrument of the State for thedevelopment of our overseas air transport.2.   Since then, several of my colleagues have circulated Papers on thissubject.  No decision has, however, yet been taken.3.   For a number of reasons, a decision is now urgently required.   Thus :-(a) Arrangements are being made for further Commonwealth discussions totake place in London at the beginning of October.  Among the subjects to be discussed will be plans for the co-ordination of Commonwealthair services, whether by joint or parallel operation, on the Empireroutes.  The agency for the operation of Canadian overseas air services will be the State-owned Trans-Canada Airlines.   The South Africanagency will be South African Airways, which is also State-owned.The Australian agency will almost certainly be Qantas Airways.   Wemust know before the Commonwealth talks start to whom responsi-bility for our overseas services will be entrusted.(&amp;) The Americans have now issued invitations to an international civil air transport conference to be held at the beginning of November.   Thediscussions at this conference will be of far-reaching importance, andit is desirable that our representatives should know before the talksstart whether or not we intend to employ, as hitherto, a singleinstrument for the development of our overseas services.(c) Plans must now be laid and commitments entered into if British aviationis to get rapidly off the mark as soon as hostilities cease.   The routes to be operated must be settled, personnel engaged and aircraft ordered.What agency is to assume these responsibilities ?   Orders for british aircraft, for example, must be placed at once if time is not to be lost.On whose behalf are these orders to be placed ?   Only if we decide that B.O.A.C. is to continue as our chosen instrument can we placefirm orders now with the assurance that delivery will be accepted.4. The recommendation which I am asking the Cabinet to endorse, i.e.,that after the war all British overseas air services, whether subsidised or not,should be the responsibility of the nationally-owned B.O.A.C., leaves open thequestion whether B.O.A.C. will themselves directly operate all our overseas services. Once a decision in principle has been taken, we can examine in greater detail what would, on merits, be the best arrangements for the actual operationof services on particular routes. In his Paper W.P. (44) 508, the Minister of aircraft Production makes one suggestion for the admission of private enterpriseunder the general umbrella of the Public Corporation. There are other possi-bilities. But the first step is to settle and announce the framework. Anannouncement is long overdue.A. H. M. S.Air Ministry, lQth September, 1944.[28248]
