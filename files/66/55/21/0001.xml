THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  September 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 521.loth September, 1944CLOSER UNION BETWEEN SOUTHERN RHODESIA, northern rhodesia AND NYASALAND.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs andthe Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN our Memorandum W.P. (44) 363 of the 1st July we mentioned that sir Godfrey Huggins had stated that it would be necessary for him to consult with his colleagues, on his return to Southern Rhodesia, about the question of apublic announcement regarding the amalgamation issue and the proposal for theestablishment of an Inter-Territorial Council.2. A copy of a letter which has now been received from Sir G. Huggins isattached as Appendix A. The letter is a little disappointing, since it suggeststhat pressure from Southern Rhodesia for amalgamation may be resumed again before long and that the idea of a standing Inter-Territorial Council has beenaccepted somewhat grudgingly. We feel, however, that we should not go backupon the offer to set up such a Council, which would, in any case, we consider, havemany practical advantages.3. At the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 12th July it was decided thatthe decision on the question of a public announcement should be deferred untilthe result of Sir G. Huggins&apos;s consultation with his colleagues was known. Weconsider that, in view of Sir G. Huggins&apos;s letter, it would be desirable that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should make an announcement as soon as possible afterthe Southern Rhodesia Legislative Assembly meets next October. The kind of statement which we have in view, and which might be made in reply to anarranged question in the House of Commons, is shown in Appendix B. We would propose that this should, be telegraphed to the Southern Rhodesia Government inadvance (as well as to the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland); and,though we do not contemplate that the Southern Rhodesia Government need beexpressly asked for their concurrence, we should be prepared to consider any comments which they might make. It would be explained to Sir G. Huggins thatwe do not think that the statement could be confined to the question of theformation of an Inter-Territorial Council, since this would be bound, to lead to questions as to its bearing on the amalgamation issue; and that, if Sir G. Hugginswould wish to make some supplementary statement simultaneously in the SouthernRhodesia Legislative Assembly as to the views of his Government regardingamalgamation, we should not offer any objection, but would like to see beforehandthe text of the proposed statement.4.   We ask for the authority of our colleagues for the course indicated above.C.O. S.Downing Street, S.W.1,15th September, 1944.Copy No.war CABINET.[28228]
Appendix A.LETTER FROM SIR G. HUG GINS.My clear Lord Cranborne, Salisburyi,Sth  Vf1^IN regard to your manuscript letter of the 9th June, 1944, handed to me mLondon on the subject of a Standing Central African Council.    In the last paragraph you asked me to consider the matter with other Ministers after myreturn to tlie Colony and to let you have our views.You will have heard from the Governor that we accept the idea of the UouncUin principle. , . ,    .     P       ,,You should know that the idea received a very mixed blessing from tiieCabinet here. . .    .It was finally decided that, unless we adopted a co-operative attitude inthis matter, we should soon find Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland absorbed intoEast Africa and ourselves absorbed by the Union of ^ouch Africa. Hence thefinal decision. c       ^As the Council must be advisory, the suggested composition of the Councilseemed rather overweighted in view of the position occupied by the Governors intheir territories and the strong position of a Prime Minister, and therefore wesuggest that each country should have three representatives so that no one should lose face if the recommendations were in the end rejected.In regard to the announcement that the Council will be set up, I think itwould be better to postpone an announcement until after our October session ofParliament, when I expect to be questioned on the matter, and then I could saythat the British Government were still adamant and that I considered that an inter-Territorial Advisory Committee should be set up for the time being and thatthere would probably be agreement to this from Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland and the Colonial Office. The House would probably agree. Alternatively, theannouncement could be made earlier and I could tell our Parliament that theGovernment had agreed in principle and then make it a vote of confidence. Inview of your statement that you must make it clear that amalgamation is not practicable in existing circumstances, it is necessary that the disagreement withthat view and adherence to the opinion that the advantages of an early amalgama-tion of the three territories outweigh the disadvantages is still the considered opinion of the Southern Rhodesia Government, be included.An alternative to the publication of a single statement including twodivergent expressions of opinion would be the publication both of a joint state-ment referring only to the Standing Council, and of two separate statementsregarding the &quot; amalgamation &quot; issue, one by the United Kingdom and the other by the Southern Rhodesia Government.If, on the other hand, no mention of the &quot; amalgamation &quot; issue were madein the published statement and if the terms of that statement were confined to adeclaration of the intention of the Governments concerned to form a Council, weshould be content to leave it at that.There would probably be great difficulty in obtaining suitable staff for theInter-Territorial Council until hostilities end, and I suggest that we have a preliminary discussion between the territories to consider this matter and seewhen it would be practicable to secure a vigorous staff. I consider the successor otherwise of the Council will largely depend on the ability of the Council&apos;staff.At this same meeting the composition and duties of the new organisation in terms of your letter could be discussed and a joint opinion submitted to you and Colonel Stanley.Before closing, I must reiterate the statement I made at our meeting, that neither you nor we know what the natives of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland would decide if they could be consulted. If we undertook propaganda and among other things promised not to increase their hut tax, or even reduce it, I think we could buy their vote. In the mass they are quite incapable of expressing a considered opinion on any issue greater than a reduction of hut tax.Your sincerely,(Signed)      G. M. HUGGINS.
Appendix B.DRAFT STATEMENT.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have recently had under further consideration the question of the relations between Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland. In considering this question, they have fully taken into account therecommendations of the Royal Commission of 1938-39. and they have also taken the opportunity to discuss the present situation in the three Territories with thePrime Minister of Southern Rhodesia and the Governors of Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland during their recent visits to this country.It is recognised that there should be the closest possible co-ordination of thepolicy and action of the Governments of the three Territories in all matters ofcommon interest, and &quot;it has been agreed with them that concrete and positivesteps should be taken to ensure that this co-ordination is effective and comprehensive-sive. With this end in view, it is proposed that a Standing Central AfricanCouncil covering the three Territories should be established on a permanent basis and that a permanent Inter-Territorial Secretariat should be set up. The council will be consultative in character and its general function will be to promote the closest contact and co-operation between the three Governments and theiradministrative and technical services. Its precise functions and constitution willbe matters for consultation between the three Governments, but it is contemplated that it should deal with communications, economic relations, industrial develop-ment, research, labour, education, agricultural, veterinary and medical matters,currency and such other matters as may be agreed between the three Governments.It is contemplated also that permanent standing committees of the Council shouldbe set up to deal with communications, industrial development, research andsuch other matters as may be agreed upon, and that, in addition, ad hocconferences should be held under the a?o-is of the Council to deal with technical and special subjects. It is intended that the leading unofficials in Northern rhodesia and nyasaland should be closely associated with the work of the Council and its committees.His Majesty&apos;s Government realise that the Southern Rhodesia government still adhere to their view that the three Territories should be amalgamated.While, however, His Majesty&apos;s Government have, after careful consideration,come to the conclusion that the amalgamation of the Territories under existingcircumstances cannot be regarded as practicable, they are confident that thepresent scheme will make an important contribution, by a closer integration ofthe administrative machinery, to the future prosperity of the two Rhoclesias and nyasaland.
