THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. Copy No.   6^W.P. (44) 550.-2nd October, 1944.WAR CABINET.WAR CRIMES BILL.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.UNDER our existing law, no British criminal Court can try or punish aforeigner for a crime committed abroad, even though the crime be committedagainst a British subject. I consider that this limitation upon the jurisdiction of the Old Bailey is, in relation to war crimes committed by Germans in thepresent war, very undesirable. A similar limitation does not exist in all countries and is not, in my opinion, required by international law. It would, therefore, be quite possible by Act of Parliament to confer jurisdiction upon a Tribunal in thiscountry so that in case of need it could try and sentence an enemy brought before it in respect of a war crime committed in Germany or elsewhere in the areaof war.2. For example, it may well be that there are German Commandants ofprisoners&apos; camps on the Continent who can be proved to have committed the vilestcrimes against British or Allied prisoners in their charge. In many cases thebest way to deal with them may be by Military Courts set up by the Allies inGermany itself. But it is very desirable to have the necessary jurisdiction inthis country, too, and until we have it there is a gap in our powers of trial andpunishment, which has already been pointed out in Parliamentary debate, and islikely to be the topic of more definite challenge now that Parliament has resumed.3. Another class of case in which the possession of this jurisdiction wouldbe valuable is that of war crimes committed at sea. If it wras wished to deal withthe Peleus case in this country, there would be no power to try German naval officers or men for murdering Greek sailors.4. Is it realised that, unless we have this power, it will be possible whenthe war is all over for a German who might be proved to have been guilty of awar crime to come to England without risk of arrest or punishment 15. My proposal, therefore, is that the Bill attached to this paper shouldbe introduced and passed into law as soon as possible. It wTouid confer jurisdic-tion to try an enemy for a war crime committed abroad. The Tribunal wouldhave a High Court Judge as President, with Assessors (either two or four) whowould be officers of our Army, Navy or x\ir Force. A most important provision would be that which authorises the Court to proceed on evidence which is not&quot;first hand&quot; evidence. Owown rules of evidence are so strict that you would never get the case properly proved unless documentary statements and the likewrere admitted.6. I would point out finally that this is quite in line with the MoscowDeclaration, for the Moscow Declaration, referring war criminals to the courts of the country where their crime wras committed&quot; does not apply to the verynumerous war crimes committed by Germans in Germany. We must certainlyrefuse to repeat the &quot; Leipsic trials.&quot;7. I submit that the prompt enactment of this Measure would have a good effect on our public opinion. I have been in communication with the ForeignOffice on the subject, and the Foreign Secretary is in favour of my proposal.8. All this, of course, has nothing to do with the fate of Hitler and thearch-criminals.house of Lords, S.W. 1.2nd October, 1944.[28317]
