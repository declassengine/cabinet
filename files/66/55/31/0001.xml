THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMEPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.: /     &quot;SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 531.19th September, 1944.WAR CABINET.TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Town and Country- Planning.1. The Reconstruction Committee, at their meeting on the 30th August(R. (44) 57th Meeting), discussed the question of finance for open spaces (seepages 6-9).It was agreed that, subject to consultation with the Departments primarily concerned, and the concurrence of the War Cabinet, an assurance should be givenin the House that Parliamentary authority would be sought to provide Exchequerassistance where it was shown to the satisfaction of the Minister and theTreasury that a Local Authority could not, without financial hardship, acquire and for open spaces up to an approved minimum standard, owing to the costof the land in relation to the financial resources of the Local Authority.2. I ask the authority of the War Cabinet to make the following statement,in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Health and theMinister of Education concur : &quot; It will be urged that Local Authorities cannot afford to make adequate provision of this kind out of their own resources.   The Government are notprepared to accept this as a general proposition.  The provision of adequateopen space is, in their view, a local not a central function; the benefit accruesalmost entirely, to the local population and only very indirectly to the nation as a whole.  As already stated, Exchequer assistance according to the circum-stances of the Authority is already forthcoming for school playing fields.The Government do not intend to supplement this by a general subsidytowards the cost of acquiring land for open spaces for other purposes.   Butin order to meet those cases in built-up areas where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Minister of Town and Country Planning and the Treasurythat a Local Planning Authority could not, without undue financial hardship,conform to the requisite standard, Parliamentary authority will be sought to provide Exchequer assistance.    A general overhaul of the financial relations between the Exchequer and Local Authorities will have to beundertaken as soon as the data on which it can be based becomes available.The Governments White Paper on Social Insurance has already pointedout a number of changes which will have to be considered.   And there areothers.   This overhaul will, in the Governments view, have to be carriedout with a definite bias in favour of alleviating the difficulties of the poorerAuthorities.   It can, however, not be undertaken in the very near future,and meantime, as an interim measure and in anticipation of it, this assistance would be given for hard cases.   It would be necessary to work out theconditions on which it would be made available.   Account would probablybe taken of such matters as the amount of the expenditure already being incurred by the Authority on public open spaces, and the cost of the proposedacquisition in relation to the financial resources of the Authority.   As soonas these matters have been further explored and the necessary consultationsconcluded, an early opportunity would be sought of giving legislative effectto them.&quot;W. S. M.Ministry of Town and Country Planning, S.W. 1,19th September, &apos;l944.[28252]
