THREAT TO MURDER ?RI30NZRS^F-J7A5Report by the Vice Chiefs of StaffWe have examined what action we might take to assistAllied prisoners of war should Hitler threaten to murder someor all of them unless the Allies come to terms.      We are advised that there is at present no concrete indication that hitler is likely to make such a threat, either with theobject of avoiding unconditional  surrender, of gaining timefor military reorganisation, or of causing dissension amongthe Allies in the final stages of the war.ITumber of Allied Prisoners2.      There are about three and a Quarter million allied prisoners in German hands.      Of these 160,000 are Imperial,28,650 American,  1,300,000 Russian and the remainder other allies, largely French.      There are known to be some 140 campsscattered throughout Germany;    many of these, however,  are -only headquarters,  the prisoners being employed in labour-gangs in the surrounding countryside.      Details of camps for russian prisoners are not known.3.      NegotiationsIt would be militarily-unacceptable to enter into any negotiations which involved suspension of hostilities withGermany at the present time.      Furthermore such action would create a dangerous precedent for the war against Japan.Methods of Assistance4.      There are three possible ways of assisting our prisoners,all requiring very careful timing,   since their success will depend on the rate of progress of our armed forces and on conditions inside Germany:-Direct A sai atan c e(a)    The employment of airborne troops.(b)    The dropping of arms to prison oamps.

Indirect Assistance(c)   A solemn governmental warning, reinforced bycounter threats if necessary.Direct Assistance5.      Airborne Trooios.      While organised military resistancecontinues, the opportunity may arise for the tactical use ofairborne troops immediately in front of our advancing ground,troops.      Since the camps are numerous and widely dispersed,however, and since many of the prisoners are not accomodated in camps at all, we do not believe that airborne troops couldassist in this way on a large scale.    in any case, troopsrequired for current operations should not be diverted for the sole purpose of protecting our prisoners, whose safety would best be assured by the speedy occupation and control ofGermany.     After German armed resistance has collapsed,opportunity may arise to use airborne troops, and plans forsuch a contingency are already under consideration by S.H.A.5.I6.      Drop-oing of Arms.      In some cases, for instance wherecontact had already been made through officers or agents and where the guards were known to be sympathetic, it might bepossible to drop arms.      In general, however,&apos; an attempt to drop arms to the prisoners would be very difficult to execute,and,  even if partially successful, would probably precipitatethe action which we wish to avoid and which might not other-wise have taken place.Indire ct As si stance7,      The Foreign Office has now recommended to us that ageneral warning4- should be  issued by the highest Anglo-American-Russian authorities, when it becomes evident that military resistance is ending,  stating that the individualcommandants and guards, no -less than the German militaryauthorities, will be held individually responsible for the safety of prisoners of war in their charge and that excusesor attempts to shift responsibility on to the S.S.  or Gestapowill not1be entertained.8.     This warning, which it is at present proposed to make-independently of any threats by Hitler, might well be effective,  since the Wehrmacht, which provides the prisonguards, has hitherto mainly adhered to the previsions of the geneva Conventions.      We consider, however,  that the declarations should not be issued until either(a) Organised military resistance has ceased or(b) Hitler has issued his threat to murder the prisoners, in which case the warning should beextended to coyer all those responsible forgiving or transmitting the orders or forcarrying out the threat.9.      Thrs effect might well be increased by the threat ofunlimited punitive action against Germany as a whole, madewith great promptness by all the Allies in concert.     Wecould emphasise to the Germans our present superiority on land and in the air,  and our  intention to  inflict on Germany as awhole greater punishment than we had previously intended,both before and. after the end of active hostilities.h- Annex

10.    We have considered the possibility of threateningreprisals against German prisoners in Allied hands.      Whetheror not the Allies were prepared to implement such a threat,however, we do not believe that it would have any deterrent effect on Hitler and the Nazi fanatics and accordingly wereject this course.Preparation for counter-action11.    If our counter-action is to have a reasonable chance ofdeterring the Germans from carrying out Hitler1 3 threats, itmust be made with the greatest promptitude and co-co-ordination between the Allies.      The necessary pamphlets and propagandashould therefore be prepared at once.      At the same time,the Germans should be given.no indication that we areapprehensive, of such a threat.Gonelusi on12.    We conclude that:-(a) The warning-proposed by the Foreign Office is the&quot;   most promising way of assisting our prisoners,but should not be issued until either&quot;.-(i)    Organised military resistance has ceased or(ii)    Hitler has issued his threat to murder the prisoners, in which case the warning should be extended.to cover all those responsible for giving or transmittingthe orders or carrying out the threat.(b) The warning proposed by the Foreign Office should in no case bo issued without a further review bythe Chiefs of Staff and the Foreign Office inthe light of the circumstances ruling at thet ime.(c) If Hitler threatens to murder the prisoners, weshould in addition issue a counter-threat ofunlimited punitive action.(d) No threat should be made of reprisals on german prisoners in our hands.(e) Opportunities may occur to drop arms into orairborne troops hear prison camps, but such operations would be very difficult to&quot; carryout on a wide scale and, moreover, might precipitate the action which we wish to avoid.(f) So long as German organised military resistancecontinues? airborne troops to protect prisonersof war should only be employed where their usedoes not conflict with the tactical interestsof the battle. -(Signed)    A. .3.
