(44) 522).R. A. B.16*A September, 1944.ANNEX.Telegram from the Government of India to the Secretary of State for India,No. 12057, dated the 15th September.Your 20487, 14th September. Draft of message to Masson. Press, whilecriticising Knott, has as far as we know made no comments on Masson or his evidence. In circumstances, publication of message at this stage will focus publicnotice on him, which is undesirable and may react on Knott. Criticism of M.W.T.organisation applies to him and not to Masson, and the obvious comment willsuggest itself that it is he who should have resigned. We doubt, therefore, if itis in anybody&apos;s interest to publish it at present.2. It may strengthen Masson&apos;s position to announce at a later stage ifnecessary that he placed -his resignation in the hands of the Ministry of war transport, who, in view of the absence of legal representation to which attention was drawn in paragraph 8 of the Government of India Resolution and of theexcellent services rendered by Masson in difficult circumstances as their repre-sentative in India, have expressed their confidence in him and asked him tocontinue to serve in that capacity.28231 ]
