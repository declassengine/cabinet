THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 533.21st September, 1944.WAR CABINET.BRETTOX WOODS CONFERENCE RESOLUTION ON ENEMY assets and LOOTED PROPERTY.AMONG the Resolutions of the Bretton Woods Conference, which theGovernments of the United Nations are invited to accept, is one Resolution VI directed against the transfer and concealment of enemy assets, and especially of looted property, in neutral countries. The terms of the Resolution are set outin the Appendix to this paper.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government has already, jointly with the Governmentsof others of the United Nations, issued declarations concerning looted property and looted gold; the policy has been one of threats aimed at inducing the neutralsto co-operate with the United Nations in depriving the enemy of the benefits of his misdeeds. The Americans have now approached us with a view7 to ourtaking parallel action with them in makings representations to the neutralsregarding Resolution VI of the Bretton Woods Conference. If we are to do soHis Majesty&apos;s Government must formally accept the Resolution.3. I think we may well be able to use the Resolution to good purposevis-a-vis the neutrals. They are already showing some signs of nervousness atthe prospect of getting themselves involved in Germany&apos;s attempts to hide awayher ill-gotten gains; now is the time to press home our policy of threats. i suggest that we should treat the Resolution as a manifesto and require the neutrals to take such measures as will fulfil the aims of the Bretton WoodsConference. We should leave it to the neutrals to decide how the task can best be carried out. It would be unwise to attempt to force them to undertake specific measures of the kind set out in the Resolution, for the measures recommendedby the Conference are such that, though the)7 are directed against the enemy, theymight also, on a strict interpretation, work to the. disadvantage of the united nations or might prove technically impossible to implement.4. If my colleagues agree that we should accept Resolution VI of the bretton Woods Conference, and that we should take parallel action with theUnited States Government in making representations to the neutrals on thissubject, His Majesty&apos;s Representatives in Berne,-Stockholm, Madrid, Lisbon andDublin will be instructed to present notes in the following terms to the Govern-ments to which they are accredited : &quot; At the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference at BrettonWoods, New Hampshire, the delegates of the forty-four Nations who took part in the Conference adopted the following Resolution (here quote the text of Resolution 6 of the Final Act of the Bretton Woods Conference).On the instructions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United KingdomI have the honour to inform your Excellency that, considering the BrettonWoods Resolution to be directed to the same purpose as was the Declarationof London of the 5th January, 1943, regarding looted property and thedeclaration which was published by His Majesty&apos;s Treasury on the22nd February, 1944, concerning gold, they fully support the Resolutionquoted above and now call upon your Government to institute such measures as will fulfil the aims of the United Nations as expressed in the Resolution.&quot;5. I suggest that we should also make an approach to the Turkish Govern-ment, but in view of Turkey&apos;s special position the note might be couched in na - ermore friendly terms.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.J.

APPENDIX.RESOLUTION VI.Enemy Assets and Looted Property. .WHEREAS, in anticipation of their impending defeat, enemy leaders, enemynationals and their collaborators are transferring assets to and through neutral countries in order to conceal them and to perpetuate their influence, power, and ability to plan future aggrandisement and world domination, thus jeopardisingthe efforts of the United Nations to establish and permanently maintain peacefulrelations;Whereas enemy countries and their nationals have taken the property of occupied countries and their nationals by open looting and plunder, by forcingtransfers under duress, as well as by subtle and complex devices, often operatedthrough the agency of their puppet Governments, to give the cloak of legality totheir robbery and to secure ownership and control of enterprises in the post-war period;Whereas enemy countries and their nationals have also, through sales andother methods of transfer, run the chain of their ownership and control throughoccupied and neutral countries, thus making the problem of disclosure anddisentanglement one of international character;Whereas the United Nations have declared their intention to do their utmost to defeat the methods of dispossession practised by the enemy, have reserved their right to declare invalid any transfers of property belonging to persons withinoccupied territory, and have taken measures to protect and safeguard property,within their respective jurisdictions, owned by occupied countries and their nationals, .as well as to prevent the disposal of looted property in United Nationsmarkets; therefore :  The United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference 1.
