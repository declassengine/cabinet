(44) 183)14th September, 1944WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 263)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 7th September, to0700 14th September,1944[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room.
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Allied warships off the south coast of France and H.M. ships in the adriatic have carried out bombardments of enemy positions.U.S. warships and carrier-borne aircraft have carried out a successful attackon Japanese shipping in the Philippines.One U-boat has been sunk and one probably sunk.Northern Waters.2. H.M. S/M Viking probably torpedoed a 3,000-ton ship in convoy offEgersund on the 1st.On the 12th aircraft from H.M. ships Trumpeter (escort carrier) andFurious (fleet carrier), operating off the Norwegian coast, sank an enemy mine-sweeper and damaged a 4,500-ton ship with cannon fire.Home Waters.3. During the military operations against Havre enemy positions wereshelled by H.M.S. Erebus (monitor) on the 8th and by H.M. ships Warspite andErebus on the 10th. Erebus was hit by an enemy shell but was not seriously damaged. At 1100 on the 12th the surrender of the German garrison of Havreput an end to the period during which the Royal Navy and the Merchant Navyhad to share the Bay of the Seine with the enemy. That period lasted 81 days from the 24th June when, at the end of the assault phase, control was transferred from ship to shore. During that period naval forces in the bay in 28 engage-ments with enemy surface-craft sank a coaster, an auxiliary and five E/R-boats,and seriously damaged a minesweeper, two trawlers and 25 E/R-boats. Further-more 64 explosive motor-boats, 42 human torpedoes and over 600 mines were destroyed. H.M. ships during the same period expended about 6,300 rounds,varying from 4-7-ihch to 16-inch in calibre, in engaging some 240 shore targets.They also brought down eight enemy aircraft and shared the destruction of two others with A.A. guns ashore. The Merchant Navy landed 1,410,600 tons of stores and 152.000 vehicles over the beaches or through the small ports of theBritish assault area and put more than 350.000 men ashore. It may be notedthat the Germans in Havre, only 20 miles from the Normandy beaches, were kept so rigorously in check that the Army lost no more than 8.260 tons of storesas a result of the enemy&apos;s best efforts to interrupt its lines of communication.4. Rapid progress has been made with the rehabilitation of Dieppe, andon the 7th the first convoy of coasters and landing craft was able to enter. Bythe 11th 12 coaster berths were available, and three more were to be availableafter the lock-gates had been repaired. At Saint-Brieuc the harbour has been opened for five coasters drawing 14 feet. Paimpol is also being brought intouse. At Antwerp the Kruisehaus dock, controlling the whole wet dock areaof the port, is known to be intact. At Ostend, in addition to the demolition ofquays and blocking of the entrance channel, two floating docks have been sunk inthe fishing harbour, and road bridges leading to the Bassin a Flot and innerharbour have been blown up. The Port Officer reports that a channel may beready in seven working days through the 14 sunken ships which block the harbour.Twelve coasters could then be accommodated. Reconnaissance of Amsterdamon the 10th and of Rotterdam on the 11th observed no demolitions: nor were there, on the 10th. any blockships to be seen in the west Schelde between Flushingand Hansweerd.Belgian motor fishing vessels and other minor craft are being collectedthroughout the United Kingdom with a view to service in Antwerp.5. During the week two Channel convoys were ineffectively shelled by enemy coastal batteries.On the 7th a troop convoy of 19 ships arrived at Cherbourg from the U.S.Bay of Biscay.6. On the night of the 6th/7th two German M.L&apos;s attacked Ushant but were driven off by the F.F.I.On the 8th the Polish destroyer Blyskawica landed small arms and supplies at the He d&apos;Yeu and St. Gilles sur Vie.On the 9th H.M.C.S. Haida (destroyer) reported that the enemy, afterdestroying all gun batteries, had evacuated Noirmoutier Island (south of st. Nazaire).
Mediterranean.7. On the 4th the U.S.S. Ludlow (destroyer) bombarded enemy positions inthe Monaco area. The next day, with the French ships Montcalm (cruiser) andLe Malin (destroyer), the Ludlow bombarded batteries, gun emplacements andtroop movements in the Men tone area. The bombardment was continued by theTudlow and the French cruiser Emile Bertin on the 6th and 7th and by theFrench ships Le Malin and Duguay-Troziin (cruiser) and the U.S.S. Hilary P.Jones (destroyer) on the 8th. On the 9th the Hilary P. Jones gave support to thearmy in breaking up counter-attacks by enemy troops in the Castillon area ofthe Riviera; with the U.S.S. Madison (destroyer) she also bombarded gun positions and mortars in the neighbourhood. The same day the Duguay-Trouin,while covering minesweepers, shelled batteries at Bordighera. On the 10th and11th the U.S. destroyers Ludlow, Madison and Woolsey with  the French shipsLorraine (battleship) and Le Malin bombarded enemy batteries, strong points and the human torpedo launching base at Ventimiglia; they also broke up anenemy counter-attack on Monte Balleada.On the 5th the Ludlow drove off two attempts by human torpedoes to attackAllied shipping in the Monaco area; she sank three of the torpedoes and took a few prisoners. On the night of the 7th/8th explosive motor-boats unsuccess-fully attacked Allied ships which were on patrol off the south coast of France;at least five of the enemy were destroyed. On the morning of the 10th, Allied shipsengaged in the bombardment of the Men tone area and in minesweeping, were attacked by human torpedoes, of which ten are reported to have been sunk; threeprisoners were taken.On the 5th September the first liberty ships were berthed at Toulon.On the night of the 10th/11th coastal forces off Savona (west of Genoa) sank an F-lighter and one or two barges.8. In the Adriatic H.M. ships continued the bombardment of enemy targets in the Rimini area. On the 6th Undine (destroyer) and Aphis (gun-boat) shelledbatteries and anti-tank guns; on the 7th Loyal (destroyer) and Scarab (gun-boat)attacked gun positions; the next day the harbour at Rimini was successfullybombarded by gun-boats, and on the 9th Urchin (destroyer) and Aphis shelledammunition dumps and road junctions. On the 10th Loyal and Undine continuedto shell the area, and on the next day, when Urchin and Scarab continued the bombardment, the former destroyed a gun position and a battery.On the night of the 6th/7th coastal forces damaged one of a force of enemyminelayers in the same area. The next night light forces sank an E-boat in FfvarChannel, Yugoslavia. A belated report has been received that on the night ofthe 3rd/4th coastal forces operating off the west coast of Greece sank twro caiquesand three lighters off Oxia island and took 21 prisoners.9. H.M. S/M Vox, on patrol in the iEgean, destroyed a caique by gunfirenorth of Crete on the 31st August, and H.M. S/M Vigorous sank one or twocaiques in the same area.There are signs that the German withdrawal from the Greek islands is being-accelerated. In some cases this is accomplished by air. Chios is reported to havebeen entirety evacuated, and 30 Ju. 52 troop-transports from Rhodes and15 from Kos are said to leave every night. A large part of the garrison atLemnos had left by the 11th, and at Andros the German garrison tried to escapein a caique on the 8th but was stormbound. Two days later the caique sailed forTenos. What appears to have been an attempt to get troops away from Cretewas frustrated during the night of the 12th/13th when H.M. destroyersTroubridge and Tuscan intercepted and sank a convoy of one ship and threecaiques with its two escorts. Carrier-borne aircraft covered the subsequentwithdrawal of the two destroyers. Nearly the whole garrison on Cephalonia inthe Ionian Sea has left the island, of which the local Greek authorities are again in control.East Indiss.10. On the 22nd August H.M. S/M Statesman torpedoed and probably sank a 3,000-ton Japanese ship which was entering Port Blair in the AndamanIslands.On the 10th September the Dutch S/M O. 19 sank a 400-ton coaster off theS.W. coast of Sumatra.On the 8th Cocos Island was attacked by one enemy aircraft but little damage was done.[28221] &apos; b
Pacific.11. U.S. carrier-borne aircraft and ships of the U.S. Pacific fleet haveattacked enemy positions on the Palau Islands (550 miles east of Davao).On the 8th US. carrier-borne aircraft supported by cruisers and destroyerssank or damaged a large number of Japanese ships and small craft in the philippines, including a convoy of 32 cargo ships which were destroyed offHinatan Bay at the north-east tip of Mindanao.Anti-Submarine Operations.12. Eighteen attacks were reported during the week, of which 13 were by warships, three by carrier-borne aircraft and two by^ shore-based aircraft.On the 5th ships of the 9th Escort Group (R.C.N.) probably sank a U-boatnorth of Land&apos;s End. and on the 9th H.M.S. Portchester Castle (corvette) sank one off the north-west coast of Ireland (R).Enemy Intelligence.13. It is not considered that the Tirpitz was seriously damaged during therecent air attacks on her, and it is reported that her main armament is effective and that she can steam at 20 knots.It is estimated that 23 destroyers and about 15 torpedo-boats are nowfully operative. All of these are in the Baltic except five Narvik classdestroyers which are in northern Norway and one Narvik and three Maas classdestroyers which are based on Southern Norway. Four Elbing class destroyersare still working up, and two destroyers and possibly five torpedo-boats are indock.TJ-boats.14. U-boats continue to maintain inshore patrols in coastal areas off theWest Coast, particularly in the approaches to the North Channel.It is reported that the Biscay ports are now almost empty.Reconnaissance of Hamburg on the 13th showed that the production of thenew types of U-boats is going on apace.Enemy Attack on Shipping.15. During the week a heavily escorted homebound convoy was attacked by a U-boat off the N.W. coast of Ireland (R). A large tanker carrying a deckcargo of 60 tanks in addition to 16,000 tons of oil, and a rescue ship accompanyingthe convoy, were sunk.  A U.S. ship was torpedoed off Cape Hatteras.1 16. Shipping losses by enemy action during August amounted to 17 ships of 95,758 tons. Marine casualties raised the total of losses from all causes to28 ships of 117,213 tons. Losses due to U-boats show another slight increase;seven ships of 49,000 tons were sunk in the Indian Ocean, seven of 30,000 tonsin the English Channel and one tanker of 10,000 tons off the N.W. coast ofIreland (R), making a total of 15 ships of 89,000 tons. In addition two ships were damaged by U-boats, one off Durban and one off the Isle of Wight, andtwo ships were damaged by human torpedoes off the Normandy coast. Two ships were mined and sunk off Arromanches and three ships wrere damaged by mines,two off the Normandy coast and one off Sardinia. One ship was damaged byE-boats in the Channel and two ships were damaged by aircraft, one in theMediterranean off Benghazi and one in the English Channel.Protection of Seaborne Trade.17. During the week ending the 10th, 712 ships in convoy in the north atlantic arrived at their destinations. Of these, 329 were in ocean convoys and 383 in British coastal convoys. Nineteen destroyers and 83 sloops, cutters,frigates and corvettes, were employed on escort duties. Five homeward-bound convoys consisting of 190 ships and three outward-bound convoys of 139 shipsreached their destinations without loss. One ship was lost in a homeboundconvoy.The total number of ships convoyed in August (excluding operationalconvoys) was 4,903 in 298 convoys, of which three ships were lost by enemy action,one in convoy and two after dispersal.
Allied Minelaying.18. Aircraft have laid mines in the Kattegat, in the Baltic, off the dutch coast and in the Danube.Allied aircraft have laid mines in the Bangkok river, in Koh Sichangharbour and in the mouth of the Pakehan river (southern Burma).Mines have also been laid off Khalkis (Greece).Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.19. There have been no reports of enemy minelaying in Home Waters or offthe Normandy coast.Channels from the Thames estuary to Ostend and the Schelde are in processof being swept.The Channel from Newhaven to Dieppe has been established and 14 groundmines were destroyed during the operation.Only six mines were destroyed in the assault area during the week and the mine total in this area is now 1,275.20. In the south of France the total of mines destroyed since the landing isbelieved to be well over 500. On the 5th a landing craft was mined and sunk atMarseilles and a French tug was sunk and a ILS^. salvage vessel was damaged inthe Port de Bouc. Approach channels have now been established for this port and for Toulon as well as the Marseilles channels, and another has been swept to port Cros, where more mines have been destroyed.A dangerous area has been declared off the east coast of Corsica.Mines are suspected off Anaphi Island in the south iEgean and mines are known to have been laid in the Doro Channel and in the approaches to theDardanelles; the waters N.W. of the Dardanelles between Samothrace and the mainland are also reported to be dangerous owing to enemy moored mines.The mine totals are 5,547 ground and 5,728 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.21. In the ports between Havre and Delfzijl (northern Holland) there are about 210,000 tons of shipping, which includes 29,300 tons of tankers. Approxi-mately 310.000 tons of shipping is also under construction.22. The ships at present in the Black Sea have presumably either beenscuttled or taken over by the Russians. It is estimated that the shipping at presentin these ports consists of six German ships totalling 8,600 tons, three or fourex-Russian ships totalling 6,000 tons and seven Bulgarian ships of 7,700 tons. Inaddition, there are reported to be about 20,000 tons of German or ex-Russian and about 14,000 tons of Rumanian shipping under repair.23. The ex-French s.s. Bordeaux (774 tons), which had been notified by theGermans as a hospital ship and was sent into a British port for inspection, was found to be carrying no sick or wounded and has therefore been treated as an ordinary capture.MILITARY SITUATION.North-West Europe.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.24. During the past week U.S. forces on a broad front have approached the frontiers of Germany, which they have pierced in several places between Trierand Aachen. Further north, British forces have established bridgeheads acrossthe Albert and Meuse-Schelde Canals in the face of bitter opposition. Theyhave also crossed the frontier into Holland. In the coastal sector Canadian troops have captured Havre and Bruges and continued to mop up enemy resistance in the pocket north of the line Antwerp-Ghent-Bruges. Dunkirk, Calais and Boulogneare still holding out.Central Group of Armies.25.   Following their recent spectacular advances, troops of the Third U.S.Army.have spent the last seven days in improving their positions and building upsupplies.  In the meantime bridgeheads have been won across the River Moselle,[28221] &apos; b 2
north and south of Metz, and south of Nancy, where armour and infantry have crossed in strength. Resistance in these areas has been strong. On the 11tharmour of the Third U.S. Army established a contact with armour of the SixthU.S. Army Group advancing from Southern France at a point just west of Dijon,and this junction of forces has since been closely knit and reinforced by infantry.Further north the First U.S. Army has continued its drive to the east. Liegewas entered by armoured forces on the 8th, the city of Luxemburg was liberatedon the 9th by a second column operating east of Sedan, and the frontiers ofGermany were entered at five points east and N.E. of Luxemburg and east ofLiege on the 13th.Northern Group of Armies.26 Strong enemy opposition was encountered by troops of the SecondBritish Army on the line of the Albert Canal, which was reached in strength onthe 7th, and it became evident that the enemy intended to make a stand alongthis water obstacle, where all bridges had been blown. In bitter fighting a smallbridgehead was, however, established west of Ffasselt which has since beenenlarged, and on the 9th a second bridgehead was gained south of Gheel some 15miles further west. Both these crossings have been bittlerly contested by theenemy, who has been reckless in his attempts to eliminate them; but our positionshave been held. The Meuse-Schelde Canal has been crossed and advance elementshave entered Holland.The First Canadian Army, continuing its advance in the coastal belt, occupiedBruges on the 12th and, having crossed the Ghent Canal between Ghent andBruges in the face of strong opposition, reached the Leopold Canal, near theDutch border ten miles east of Bruges, on the same day. All enemy oppositionsouth of the line Ghent-Bruges has now been liquidated with the exception ofthe Channel ports Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk, which are strongly held. LeHavre was captured on the 12th, 36 hours after the commencement of a landassault. -Southern France.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)27. The Seventh U.S. Army, having advanced 350 miles in 28 days, hasnow joined with General Eisenhower&apos;s armies. Throughout the past week steady progress has been made up the valley of the Saone and the approaches to theBelfort Gap have been increasingly threatened.Along the line of the Jura, Pontarlier was captured on the 6th and theforces in this sector swept rapidly forward to within 20 miles of Belfort; recently,they have been countered by growing resistance and further advances have beenmade only by hard fighting.In the centre of the army front the key town of Besancon fell on the 8th,two clays after the River Douds had been forced on the west. With the capture of Baume les Dames on the 9th, the delaying positions along the Doubs were finally broken and the advance has been resumed in strength. Vesoul was captured on the 12th.Along the Saone the principal achievement has been the capture of Dijon,which was accomplished by French forces on the 11th. On the west flank our troops are in Autun. Contact has been made with troops of General Patton&apos;sThird U.S. Army at Chatillon-sur-Seine and at Chaumont.Italy.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)28. Little further progress was made in the early part of the week in the adriatic sector. The enemy strenuously defended the high ground running from.E. to N.W. through the key village of Coriano. and we were not able to movehim from this position. On the night of the 12th/13th. a new attack was made which resulted in the capture of the Coriano-S. Savino ridge and in the surrounding of Coriano.On the Fifth Army front considerable progress has been made againstpractically negligible opposition. The line has been carried forward until it is virtually in touch with the Gothic Line all the way from Dicomano almost toLucca. &quot;This advance was made mainly on the 10th, but before that Allied troops had secured Pistoia. The latest position is that Dicomano, Borgo S. Lorenzo,Pistoia and Lucca, are in our hands and Vernio, on the Prato-Bologna road,had almost been reached, as had Viareggio on the west coast.There was bad weather with heavy rain during the early part of the week.
The Russo-German Front.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Central Sector.29. There is no confirmation by the Russians of German reports of strongRussian attacks S.W. of Przemysl.Southern Sector.30. The Russians have occupied the greater part of eastern and southernRoumania, and they are now striking northwards through the passes of theTransylvanian Alps. Sibiu has been captured, and Russian troops are fanningout both from there and from Brasov. In the central sector of the Eastern Frontthey have occupied Lomza.After declaring War on Bulgaria on the 5th, the Russians crossed the lowerDanube and occupied Rustchuk and the ports of Varna and Burgas. the bulgarians, who had already asked for an armistice, did not oppose this move,and the Russians announced on the 9th that military operations against Bulgariahad ceased.Yugoslavia.31. Assisted by aircraft of the Balkan Air Force the Partisan offensive against the enemy&apos;s communications in all parts of the country has continuedsuccessfully.The Partisans have been able to extend their control in many areas,particularly in Serbia, where they have captured several important railway centres. Bulgarian troops are now believed to have withdrawn from NorthSerbia.In Macedonia Partisans now occupy a strong position stretching from theAlbanian frontier to the Vardar Gap, and both railways from Greece are denied to the Germans. Bulgarian troops in this area have been ordered to co-operate against the Germans.Greece.32. Chios, Mitylene, Andros and the eastern half of Crete have been evacuated, and, except for the northern and eastern portions, the Peloponnesusis now also free of Germans.Two German divisions from the Athens area and one division from North-West Greece are moving northwards. Some at least of these forces are pre-sumably intended to protect the vital Belgrade-Salonika railway.The enemy&apos;s withdrawal is being successfully harassed by guerrillas and personnel of the Allied Mission. Railways have been cut in several places, and road convoys attacked.Chios is now controlled by.E.A.M., which is also expected to gain control in Crete.Burma.33. The advance down the Imphal Road towards Tiddin continues. -Leading troops are now 23 miles south of the Assam-Burma border. Our forcesadvancing down the Kabaw Valley have- reached a point 14 miles south ofHtinzin. The troops who recently occupied Sittaung have established detach-ments on the eastern bank of the River Chindwin. Further north, Thaungduthas been occupied without opposition.In North Burma British troops have continued their advance down theMyitkyina-Katha Railway, and have occupied Hopin.In Arakan a small action flared up when our troops attacked and ejecteda Japanese detachment from a point on the Mayu Range, seven miles east ofMaungdaw.AIR SITUATION.General Review.34. Strategical bombing of Germany&apos;s war industry, particularly her oil production and storage, was intensified. The defences at Havre were veryheavily bombed. In the battle area, apart from the support provided foradvancing Allied troops, a considerable part of our activity was directed against
tactical targets on both sides of the Siegfried line and on traffic centres leading to it.Enemy communications in Italy were again heavily attacked. Bad weatherinterfered with operations, but heavy bombers attacked military objectives inSouth-Eastern Europe.United Kingdom.35.   No enemy aircraft operated over this country during the week.Home Waters.36. Aircraft of Coastal Command, five of which did not return, flew812 sorties involving 7,835 flying-hours. Bomber Command aircraft (four are missing) laid 339 sea-mines.Numerous attacks were made on convoys and coastal shipping though, in several instances, results could not be observed. Torpedo, R.P. and cannon attacks by Beaufighters on a large group of shipping off Den Helder resulted in anincomplete destroyer receiving a number of hits, at least two ships being leftburning and several others being severely damaged. Beaufighters and Wellingtonsset fire to three ships and damaged four others off the Frisian Islands and, offthe Norwegian coast, four minesweepers and a coaster were damaged. Avengerssank an E/R boat off Flushing.Western Front.37. Weather interrupted operations on two days. During the remainder ofthe week, a series of major attacks, ranging from the Ruhr to Czechoslovakia,was carried out against the enemy&apos;s war industry. These attacks were directedmainly-&quot;on oil plants and refineries, though various other targets includingchemical works, ordnance depots and M.T., tank and aircraft factories were also heavily bombed. While these attacks were being made, our tacticaloffensive was prosecuted unremittingly over the entire battle area.During the week ended dawn on the 12th, 10,889 sorties were flown by aircraft of the A.E.A.F., 47 of which are missing; four enemy aircraft were shot down; 3,678 tons of bombs were released. For the week ended dawn on the14th, aircraft of Bomber Command and the VIII U.S. Commands flew 15,879sorties and dropped 27,680 tons; 340 aircraft are missing; enemy losses in combatwere 267 destroyed, 50 probably destroyed, and 89 damaged, while at least 225more were destroyed on the ground.Claims of enemy transport destroyed include 850 M.T. vehicles, 110 tanks and A.F.V., 100 horse-drawn vehicles, one train, 190 locomotives, 440 railroadcars and trucks and 20 barges; 35 gun positions were demolished.Approximately 3,500, sorties were flown by transport aircraft carrying troops and supplies to the front and in the evacuation of wounded from the fightingzones; these missions included the delivery of freight and stores to advancedairfields.The reaction of G.A.F. fighters showed, on occasion, a marked increase invigour. Some of our operations against oil targets in Germany were intercepted by larger formations than have been encountered recently and, in general, enemy attacks were pressed home with some persistence.France.38. Our heaviest effort was concentrated on Havre. Prior to the surrender of its garrison, this extensive port with its coastal defences was subjected to air bombardment for a week. During the period of this Resume, 6,500 tons of bombs were released, of which nearly 5,000 tons were dropped on one day. Strong points at Boulogne were attacked on three days, when a total of 305 tons was dropped.Offensive operations on a number of other targets including the bombing of fuel dumps and bridges near Nancy (530 tons) and of German stronffpoints in front of Metz (850 tons). &apos; .The Battle Front.39. Medium and fighter-bombers and fighters carried out a large numberof successful sorties in close support of our troops arid on armed reconnaissances.Medium bombers were active against river crossings near Bruges, ferries and road
junctions near Flushing and Rotterdam and made low-level assaults on targetson both sides of the Siegfried line. Other aircraft, operating ahead of advancingtroops, bombed concrete emplacements in the river loop at Echtermach, just north of Trier, and fortifications at Schied, 30 miles north of Aachen. Heavy bombers attacked Frankfurt-am-Ruhr (1,560 tons) and Osnabruck (330 tons), tactical railcentres for military traffic to the Siegfried line.Germany, Czechoslovakia and Poland.40. Formations of escorted heavy bombers made powerful attacks on 24 oil-producing plants in Central and Eastern Germany; more than 6,000 tons of bombs were dropped. Other important operations included the bombing of chemical works at Ludwigshafen (1,275 tons), rail centres at Karlsruhe (600 tons), Ulm(710 tons), munster (350 tons) and Heilbronn (230 tons). Tank, M.T. and kindredfactories  at  Stuttgart  (1,085  tons),   Gustavsburg  (1,000   tons),   Nuremberg(370 tons) and Gaggenau (370 tons) were bombed with good effect, as wereordnance depots at Mainz (340 tons) and Magdeburg (150 tons).Among others, the following centres of industry were attacked : Darmstadt(1.110 tons), Mannheim (840 tons), munchen-Gladbach (610 tons) and dusseldorf(535 tons).Many of the foregoing missions were carried out in favourable weather andthe resultant destruction was, in several instances, reported as very heavy[vide Appendix VII).Mosquitoes maintained their harassing raids at night; they attacked, among other targets, Berlin (190 tons), Nuremberg (60 tons), Brunswick (55 tons) andKarlsruhe (50 tons).Seventy-five Fortresses bombed automobile works at Chemnitz and proceeded to bases in Russia.Mediterranean Front.41. During the week ended the 12th, Allied aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flewa total of 8,546 sorties, of which 2,069 (19 missing) were by heavy bombers; 7,287tons of bombs were dropped. A total of 47 Allied aircraft are missing and11 enemy aircraft were destroyed.Enemy transport formed the main targets for fighters and fighter-bombersin the South of France, but the energies of the Tactical Air Force were princi-pally directed at communications, enemy defences and M.T. in Italy. the strategic Air Force bombed railway targets in Yugoslavia and Italy, and indus-trial and oil installations in South Germany and Austria.South of France.42. Fighters and fighter-bombers attacked enemy communications andtransport, destroying and damaging a number of locomotives, rolling-stock andM.T. in the Rhone Valley and battle areas.Italy.43. Operations by heavy bombers were reduced owing to bad weather, butthe railway centres at Ferrara (186 tons), Bologna (157 tons), and Milan (123 tons)were bombed with good results. A good concentration wras obtained when210 tons were dropped on Ravenna canal wharves, several fires being started.The port of Trieste was damaged, and many fires were observed, when Liberatorsdropped 159 tons of bombs.Medium and fighter-bombers attacked a variety of targets during the week,railway bridges and other enemy communications being in the majority. Fourrailway bridges were cut north of Bologna, and direct hits obtained onfive others north of Florence. Five pontoon bridges on the River Powere destroyed. A number of locomotives, rolling-stock and M.T. was destroyed and damaged.The Italian liner Reiv was set on fire by Beaufighters which obtained manvR.P. strikes below the water-line. One 2,000-ton ship was sunk and anotherset on fire during an attack on shipping in the Gulf of Trieste, and a numberof hits were obtained on vessels in the Gulf of Genoa.In these operations medium, light and fighter-bombers flew a total of 2,978sorties for the loss of 11 aircraft.South-Eastern Europe.44. Considerable damage was done to the airfield at Lechfeld (S. ofAugsburg) when 256 Fortresses and Liberators dropped 525 tons.   Good results
were also obtained when 155 tons were dropped on an aero-engine works atAllaeh (7 miles N.W. of Munich), and 174 tons on a jet-propelled aircraft factory at Wasserburg (30 miles S.E. of Munich). Heavy bombers effectively attackedfour oil and industrial targets near Vienna, dropping a total of 728 tons.Seventy-five Fortresses of the 8th U.S. Air Force, returning from Russia(vide paragraph 40), report excellent results after an attack on Diosgyor in hungary.  These aircraft landed in Italy.Heavy bombers of the Strategic Air Force bombed railway centres in Yugo-slavia at Brod (148 tons), Sarajevo (160 tons), and Nis (228 tons), all with good results. Railway bridges at Brod and Sava were also attacked and in the caseof the former, where 100 tons were dropped, excellent results were observed. AtSava the railway tracks were cut.When Mustangs attacked the airfield at Ilandza (35 miles N.E. of Belgrade),36 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.A number of attacks were made by the Balkan Air Force on shipping offYugoslavia, and enemy transport and communications in that country sustainedmuch damage from medium and fighter-bombers.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.1. Darmstadt. The centre of the town and the adjacent fully built-built-up areas have been devastated by the Bomber Command attack of the11th/12th September. Damage has been caused mainly by fire and more than45 fires were still raging 12 hours after the attack. A large barracks area inthe west part of the town has suffered heavily, and the railway wagon shops and several unidentified industrial concerns have.been affected.2. dusseldorf.-As a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 9th September,the Rheinmettal Borsig armaments plant has again been severely damaged. Awing of the assembly shop has been gutted, a machine shop is now two-thirdsdestroyed, and a large unidentified building is now seven-eighths gutted. the machine and assemply shop, another machine shop, foundry, a wing of the steel-making shop and press shop have all suffered severe roof damage. Many buildings which had been repaired, or were in course of repair after previous attacks, have again been damaged. Several tracks in the Dusseldorf marshalling yard havebeen cut and some rolling stock destroyed or damaged. There is some freshbusiness and residential damage in the already practically devastated town.3. Eisenach. While the central portion of the B.M.W. aero-engine andA.F.V. factory, which comprises the assembly and repair area, the power-plantarea and administrative offices, has been heavily damaged by the U.S.A.A.F.attack on the 11th September, every area in the plant has been affected in varying degrees.The B.M.W. aero-engine factory in the district of Stockhausen has also been heavily hit and most of the important buildings in the factory, including fourmachine shops and two test beds, have been severely damaged.4. Emden. Further photographs show that the daylight attack by bomber command on the 6th September caused very severe damage, and the heart of thecity, which is the business and residential area, is now almost destroyed. Manyquay buildings in the Alter Binnenhafen have suffered destruction, and thesubmarine, building yard of Nordseewerke has received major damage to itsengineering shops and foundries.5. Fulda. As a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 11th September theGummiwerke tyre factory has been severely damaged. The two largest buildings have suffered heavily, a medium building has been gutted and some smallerbuildings have received varying degrees of damage and destruction. There is some business and residential damage north of the factory, and tracks in therailway storage sidings have been cut.6. Gaggenau. The U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 10th September caused con-siderable damage to the Daimler Benz M.T. factory. Two of the nine main work-shops have been gutted and four severely and two slightly damaged, theadministrative buildings have also been heavily affected. There is also consider-able residential damage in the area N.W. of the factory.7. Giebelstadt Airfield. As a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the10th September severe damage has been caused to the airfield facilities. Onehangar has been gutted and three hangars, two workshops, fuel storage areas, theM.T. yard, refuelling points, railway sidings and the barracks areas have allsustained damage.   There are approximately 75 craters on the landing ground.8. Heilbronn. The U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 10th September causeddamage to the railway centre. The engine round-house has been half destroyed and tracks in the sorting sidings and dock sidings have been cut; many wagonsin these sidings have been damaged or derailed. There is some business and residential damage to the west.
9. Kamen. As a result of the daylight attack by Bomber Command on the11th September, very concentrated damage has been caused in all parts of the synthetic oil plant, and the contact oven house, the water gas plant, and the gaspurification plant have all suffered severely. In the coking plant on the southside damage is equally heavy and the power station and boiler house and several buildings in the by-products plant have been destroyed or severely damaged.Nearly all the buildings of the colliery, including the pit-head installations, havebeen affected. All the large cooling towers in the target area, three large gas holders and a number of oil storage tanks have been destroyed or damaged.Many hits have cut railway tracks and damaged tank wagons and other rolling-stock in sidings. Some damage has also been caused to the workers&apos; housingestate south-east of the plant, where a number of houses has been destroyed.10. Mainz. Very heavy damage has been inflicted on the Ordnance depot at Kastel as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 8th September. Of thethirteen standard ramped buildings, nine have been half or more destroyed andthree of the remaining four have been damaged. The two large storage buildings have also been severely affected and one large, three medium and ten small buildings have suffered varying degrees of damage and destruction. TheCellulose factory in the same district has also been damaged. The city of Mainzhas suffered considerable scattered business and residential damage and thereis some in the outlying suburb of Bischoffscheim, where the large railway round-house has been half destroyed.11.

Two workshops inthe A.F.V. Works of Ffeinrieh Lonz A.G. have also been affected.12-. Misburg. As a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 11th and12th September, a large volume of black smoke obscures the west end of the oil refinery and this appears to come from the storage tanks west of the stabilisationplant, It can be seen that at least two tanks in the final products storage areahave been further damaged.13. munchen-Gladbach. While clouds obscure the northern and westernoutskirts of the town, it can be seen that the closely built-up area of business and residential property round the main passenger station, of which the mainbuilding has been gutted, has been largely devastated by the Bomber command attack on the 9th-10th September; the damage is particularly severe to the southand east. On the S.W. outskirts of the town, severe damage has been inflicted on industrial property, many buildings being destroyed and others damaged.Photographs, taken soon after the attack, showed that three rows of passengercoaches were on fire in the sidings west of the station alongside the line toDiisseldorf, and that scattered business and residential damage has been caused in the northern part of Rheydt.14.

In addition, a group of huts or stores sheds in the north-westcorner of the site has been practically devastated. In the storage depot to thewest, two out of four large storage buildings have been partly destroyed andanother building damaged. There are many craters among barracks still further to the west.
