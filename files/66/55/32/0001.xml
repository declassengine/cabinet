THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET. 4 Copy No.W.P. (44) 532.20th September, 1944.WAR CABINET.LONDON HOUSING SITUATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction and the Minister ofLabour.1. The Housing Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee is keepingunder review the efforts which are being made, under the general direction ofSir Malcolm Trustram Eve, to improve the very serious housing position inLondon due to the damage caused by the flying bomb.2. There are three respects in which we wish to enlist the help of the service departments : (a) The resumption of Army leave for British, Canadian and United states forces early next month would considerably complicate the situation.It will be necessary to bring building operatives into London from outside in large numbers, and we shall need all the available hostelaccommodation and domestic staff which can be secured. We hope,therefore, that it may be possible to place London out of bounds forall troops on leave, other than those with their homes in that area.. (&amp;) We should be glad if the Service Departments would agree to surrender to the Civil Departments any requisitioned property in the london area which is not in use, and would also be prepared to consider sympathetically applications for property still in use. All availableempty accommodation will have to be employed for housing purposes.(c) The staffing of the hostels required to house building operatives brought in from outside London presents many difficulties and it would assistif the Service Departments would make available women from theWomen&apos;s Services who are qualified to act as cooks and to undertakeother domestic duties. Indeed, without this help it will be impossible,having regard to other competing demands, especially for hospitals,to staff the hostels within any reasonable period.(d) There is a considerable number of Italian prisoners of war with experience in erecting huts w?ho are now employed by GovernmentDepartments, mainly the War Office. It would be helpful if these could be released to do similar work in London. It is accordingly suggested that the Interdepartmental Committee on the allocation of Prisoners of War should be instructed to examine this proposal as a matter of urgency, with a view to making the Italian prisoners ofwar available for work in London as soon as possible.W.E. B.18th September, 1944.[28256]
