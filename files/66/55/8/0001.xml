THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government 1Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1944. secret.W.P. (44) 508.September, 1944.WAR CABINET.CIVIL AVIATION.MONOPOLY AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.IT seems clear that two strongly opposed views exist as to the future of civilaviation in this country.2. On the one hand the advantages of a centralised control are stressed,strong enough to provide adequate services wherever required and doing away with the sort of useless and wasteful competition which marked the rise of railway traffic in the country, and brought chaos into the road traffic organisation.3. On the other hand the value of initiative is stressed in the developmentof a new means of transport. Even the strongest supporters of private enterpriseagree that a great measure of Government assistance would be necessary. to quote the Secretary of State for India&apos;s Phillipic in favour of private enterprise(W.P. (44) 498)-&apos;&apos; The State must intervene both to encourage and help and also to direct.....It is for the State to provide research in every aspect, not only by conducting such research directly through its own staff, but by placingsuch facilities as wind tunnels, testing of materials, &amp;c. at the disposal of thepublic.   Similarly, it is for the State to provide the aerodromes, &amp;c.&quot;4.   It is contemplated as well that subsidies of some kind may be necessary.5. For all this expenditure and effort the State is to get no return and tohave no say in the running of civil aviation.6. It is perhaps worth while to consider this matter quite objectively, apartfrom any political arguments on the merits of public versus private enterprise.7. There are certain services which it is agreed can only be provided byState action : these are 1(a) Education and Research.(b) Aerodrome signal and landing facilities.(c) Meteorological services.8. There are further services which can certainly be provided both more economically and more efficiently by some central organisation (a) Training of pilots and crews.(b) Servicing of aircraft and engines.(c) Inspection of aircraft for safety, &amp;c.9. The importance of these services cannot be overstressed, since upon theefficiency with which they are carried out will depend the safety and reliability of the transport services offered and the reputation of British aviation.10. It is also of the utmost importance that good conditions of service, pay and pensions should be provided for pilots, aircrews and their dependents.These are much more easily attained if there is a central organisation dealingwith all these matters. The small one or two aircraft organisations such asexisted pre-war in this country are quite unable to maintain the necessarystandards of service, despite any regulations that may be made.[28185]Copy No.    fj 04
11. All the above matters relate to the technical side of flying and not tothe question of providing a transport service.12. There are other matters connected with transport, such as standards of accommodation, airport amenities, collection of passenger and freight traffic,fares, &amp;c, which have no direct relation to safety, but are important factors inthe popularity of an air-service.13. The question therefore seems to present itself as to whether there isnot some compromise method avoiding either of the extremes of a single monopolyand undiluted private enterprise which might not enable us to get the best rather than the worst of both worlds.14.   I suggest that such a compromise can be found in the following way :  A single central organisation (e.g., B.O.A.C.) to be responsible for all thetechnical matters above set out, while private enterprise can provide all theinitiative as regards the second list of matters.15. This can be done by making the B.O.A.C. an owning corporation, i.e., toown all aircraft and a servicing body, i.e., to do all training and employment of pilots and crews. The B.O.A.C. would then charter to private companies suchplanes as they desired from time to time, providing the crews with the planes.16.   This would have many advantages : (i) It would provide a comparatively large and stable personnel, givingopportunity for a sufficient surplus for proper service conditions,. length of hours flying, pensions, &amp;c.(ii) It could centralise all repair and servicing in the B.O.A.C., both in thiscountry and abroad.(iii) Charter rates could be fixed to have relation to the value of traffic carriedso as if necessary -to carry an element of subsidy or. if possible, to.&apos; get some return for the great State expenditure that will otherwise gounremunerated.(iv) There would be a pool of aircraft giving a far greater flexibility in numbers for each individual company, enabling them to increase or decrease their fleet at comparatively short notice.(v) Regular users could arrange to have particular types of planes builtspecially for them if they wished or could use standard types.(vi) From the point of view of the civil aviation industry, the advantageswould be very great, since the Government could arrange through their control of B.O.A.C. to see that only British planes were provided,whereas otherwise the individual operators might purchase Americanplanes.(vii) This is a matter of the utmost importance to the future of the industry,as, unless we can ensure that all British operators use British planes,we shall have no firm basis upon which to build up the industry. i know no other method by which such an end can be secured,(viii) Finally, there would be the competitive attractions which could beprovided by different operators, either by choosing different types of aircraft or by providing better services (meals, stewards,furnishings, &amp;c.) in the aircraft, or by giving better passengerfacilities at the terminals (motor cars, hotel accommodation, &amp;c), orby the frequency, &amp;c, of their services.17. There would be nothing to prevent certain main communication linesbeing allocated to the B.O.A.C. as an operating body either exclusively or in competition with other operators.18. From an objective point of view, I suggest to my colleagues that thiscompromise does provide the best of both worlds and is more likely than any othersystem, short of a complete monopoly, to build up a reliable standard of safe and efficient air transport of which both the country and the operator can be proud.R.
