THlSi U iyi c w T 10 uncPROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT7Printed for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.   It is issued for the personal use of top SECRET.W.P. (44) 502.bth September, 1944.Copy No.WAR CABINET.FROPOSAL BY GENERAL ARNOLD FOR A SECOND JOINT ANGLO-AMERICAN STATEMENT REGARDING JET-PROPELLEDAIRCRAFTIN January 1944, when production of jet-propelled aircraft began, it became necessary to issue a joint Anglo-American statement in order to preventspeculations and unauthorised disclosures in the Press, more particularly inAmerica, giving information to the enemy. It was feared then that unofficialstatements and articles by each side would tend through competitive publicity to prejudice security. It was therefore agreed between Sir Charles Portal andGeneral Arnold that no farther official statements would be made and that theywould discourage, so far as they could, any publicity in the Press on this subject.2. Recently the Ministry of Aircraft Production recommended that, in theinterests of production, this policy should be altered and that a statement shouldbe issued by us revealing that British jet-propelled aircraft were operational. Itwas most unlikely that the Americans would agree to a one-sided public disclosurethat in the development of these aircraft we were ahead of them. At the sametime it was undesirable on security grounds to reveal to the enemy that we were operating jet-propelled aircraft against the flying-bombs.3. Speculation in the Press about the use of jet-propelled aircraft againstflying-bombs led the War Cabinet to rule* that it was most important to preventthe enemy from discovering our plans about future operations and the develop-ment of our new weapons. Again, at the meeting on the 31st July, 1944, it wasdecidedt to discourage all references or speculations in the Press about the operational use of these aircraft.4. The enemy has in the meantime brought a certain number of them intouse against Allied, more particularly American, aircraft. Several engagementshave already taken place and a good deal of public interest has been aroused inAmerica. The fact that the enemy is using this modern equipment against theAmerican forces has increased the pressure upon General Arnold to issue some further statement reassuring the American public that the enemy has not beenalone in developing this new weapon. Under this pressure General Arnold has proposed that a second joint statement on the subject should be made. Thedirection of the War Cabinet is desired as to what answer should be sent toGeneral Arnold.5. From the British point of view the Ministry of Aircraft production would like a statement made for the encouragement of their work-people andas a recognition of British enterprise in this field. No new technical information would be conveyed to the enemy by a general statement.* W.M. (44) 98fch Conclusions, Item 3. f W.M.

6. There are certain disadvantages in making a further joint statement at this time. The Germans are. in fact, ahead of us in the employment of this new weapon. We as yet are only using them in very small numbers and not against either the German or Japanese Air Force. It may be some months before they will be used in substantial numbers. It thus seems undesirable to make a claim which might later be found to have been lacking in substance.7. On balance, the Vice-Chiefs of Staff are in favour of a public statementbeing made. This would be framed in general terms to show that British and american development of jet-propelled aircraft had reached the operationalstage, and would reassure the public while in no way suggesting that our develop-ment is in advance of the enemy&apos;s. Such a statement would be disconcertingrather than otherwise to the enemy and would no longer present any securityobjection.   A draft of the kind of statement contemplated is attached.*8. The War Cabinet is asked to agree that a further statement should bemade and that the Chief of the Air Staff, after consultation with the Ministryof Aircraft Production, should have discretion to agree a joint text withGeneral Arnold.(Signed) A. E. NYE.D. C. S. EVILL.E. N. SYFRET.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1.5th September, 1944.* Annex.ANNEX.Draft Announcement for Discussion with General Arnold.COMMUNIQUES and correspondents&apos; stories from the European theatrehave recorded that allied aircraft have been in action against German jet-propelled fighters.The appearance of these new types had been expected and it is gratifying to note that their design, features and operational characteristics appear to followclosely the estimates which had been formed of them.Our aircrews were not therefore surprised and in engagements to date havehad satisfactory exchanges with them in combat.A number of attacks have been successfully beaten off before they could develop. None of our own aircraft is known to have been shot down, while ouraircrews have already destroyed some of them.We must expect, however, that as their numbers increase and their crews gainmore experience of handling them in action they will become more effective thanthey have so far proved to be.Meanwhile, our own jet-propelled aircraft are also coming into operationalservice against the enemy. Details of these aircraft and their engines must still remain secret, but research scientists, aircraft technicians and workers in bothBritain and America may take pride in the work and the speed at which this newweapon is going into the hands of our air forces.
