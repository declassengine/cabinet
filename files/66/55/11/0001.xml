(44) 511.%th September, 1944.WAR CABINET.EXPLOSION IN  THE BOMBAY DOCKS ON 14th APRIL.  1944.Memorandum by the Minister of Education.IN the absence of the Secretary of State for India and the Minister of war transport I am circulating the memorandum below on their behalf. Before theyleft the country they had approved the presentation of a joint paper in this sense.2. On the 14th April, 1944, a disastrous explosion took place in the BombayDocks, due to the blowing up during unloading of the s.s. Fort Stikine, a shipcarrying a mixed cargo including explosives. The explosion caused casualties inkilled and missing estimated at 900 persons. Seventeen ships, totalling about50,000 tons, either became total losses or sustained very heavy damage, and other vessels were more or less seriously damaged. Severe damage occurred to the victoria and Princes Docks, both being put out of operation, while other dockssuffered to a lesser extent. A fire following the explosion destroyed much propertyboth in the Docks and in the built-up residential area surrounding it. Food grainsestimated at 36,000 tons were lost in the fire.3. Energetic steps were taken by the military, naval and civil authorities to effect the necessary repairs to the docks and to restore the damaged equipment.Princes Dock is now operating normally, but extensive repair and clearance work was found to be necessary in the Victoria Dock, and though progress is reportedto be satisfactory it is unlikely to be available for use until October.4. The Government of India accepted liability for the payment of compensa-tion for death and injury on a prescribed scale, and for damage to property not covered by insurance at the rate of 75 per cent, of its value. They also reached anagreement with the insurance interests under which insurers are meeting claims under their policies, and the Government of India bear the following proportionof the liabilities under those policies : (a) Marine Policies 40 per cent.(b) Fire Policies 87^ per cent.(c) Miscellaneous policies 50 per cent.In undertaking this liability the Government of India were greatlyconcerned to prevent the mass of litigation which would otherwise have beenunavoidable between insured and insurers, and between those who have sufferedloss and the various authorities who might be regarded as having some responsi-bility for the disaster. A condition was made that recipients of compensation under the scheme as well as those insured should accept payment as a final settlement, forgoing all rights to further compensation from other parties,including His Majesty&apos;s Government. While no exact estimate is available thecost to the Government of India of this compensation scheme is expected to bein the region of  177^ million. It is possible that they will request His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to bear a share of this expenditure.5. On hearing of the disaster the Prime Minister requested the viceroy to institute a searching enquiry into it.   Steps had in fact already been taken[28187] b
in this direction and a Commission of Enquiry was set up by the Government ofIndia consisting of : Sir Leonard Stone, O.B.E., Chief Justice of the High Court, Bombay.Mr. S. B. Dhavle, I.C.S. (retired) formerly Judge of the High Court,Patna.Rear-Admiral C. S. Holland, R.X.-on the Staff of the Commander-m-Chief, Eastern Fleet.Their terms of reference were to enquire into and report on the causes of the fire and explosions and into the adequacy of the action taken before, during andafter the disaster. The Commission had the assistance of five assessors appointedby the Government of India.6. The Commissioners have now presented their First Report, dealing withthe position up to the time of the first of the two explosions which occurred ins.s. Fort Stikine. A summary of this Report is attached as Appendix A. Afurther Report will be issued covering subsequent events. The Report dismissesthe possibility of sabotage. It states that the fire which led to the explosionarose from the accidental ignition of cotton which formed part of the ship&apos;scargo, and which was in the same hold as explosives, probably due to the carelessdiscarding of a cigarette or match. The factors which the Commission recordas constituting the primary causes of the disaster and their statement of instancesin which action was deficient and so contributed at one stage or another eitherto the occurrence or the extent of the disaster, are summarised in Appendix A.7. The Report presents a clear factual picture of events, but its findingscontain much material which will provide useful ammunition for the critics ofBritish administration in India. It so happens that most of those concerned inthe events leading up to the disaster were Europeans, and the Report gives theimpression that these were guilty of a series of failures of judgment and thatthose concerned after the fire was detected lost their heads. The Ministry ofWar Transports organisation in India, and in particular its head, Mr. Masson,are strongly criticised with questionable justification and the statement is made that the vested interests of peace-time influence, if they do not govern, the controlof Ministry ships in Indian waters. The fact that the evidence of witnesses wasnot led and that there was no opportunity to test it by cross-examination, since no legal representation was allowed, or to offer rebutting evidence, since theproceedings were in camera and all witnesses were sworn to secrecy, no doubtcontributed largely to the inaccuracy of these findings.8. It is inevitable that a Report on a disaster of such magnitude should bepublished, subject to any security objections, and in the present case no suchobjections exist.. Moreover, the Government of India, in announcing the settingup of the Commission, committed themselves to publishing the Report exceptsuch parts as in the opinion of the Commission would be detrimental to the publicinterest or to the successful prosecution of the war. Failure to publish would inevitably raise suspicion in India with results possibly more damaging than would ensue from publication. Publication has therefore been approved andwill take place in India on the 12th September. It is, however, unfortunate, both from the point of view of Anglo-Indian relations and oti account of the ill-informed criticisms of the Ministry of War Transports organisation in India,that this could not be avoided.9. The Government of India&apos;s Resolution under cover of which the report will be published is attached as Appendix B. In order to controvert the incorrectand in some cases, tendentious statements made regarding the Ministry of WarTransports organisation, it has been arranged that this shall include (para-graphs 8-10) a statement on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government which has beenagreed between the Government of India, the Secretary of State for India and theMinister of War Transport. It is also proposed &quot;that the Minister of war transport should telegraph an expression of his confidence to Mr. Masson shortly after the Report is published, with authority to publish the message in the IndianpressR.

APPENDIX A.SUMMARY OF THE FIRST REPORT OF THE COMMISSION OFENQUIRY INTO THE BOMBAY DISASTER.I. Constitution of the Commission.THE Commission consisted of Sir Leonard Stone, O.B.E., Chief Justice ofthe High Court of Judicature at Bombay (as President), Mr. S. B. Dhavle, I.C.S.(retired), a former Judge of the High Court of Judicature at Patna, and Rear-Admiral C. S. Holland, on the Staff of the Commander-in-Chief, Eastern Fleet.The Commission had the assistance of five Assessors and three expert advisers.II. Terms of Reference.The Commission was charged with reporting on the causes of the fire and explosions in the Bombay Docks on the 14th April, 1944, and into the adequacy of the action taken before, during and after the disaster. Its sittings were heldin camera and the Commission imposed an oath of secrecy upon witnesses &quot;to keepsecret what transpired before them.III. -Facts about the s.s. Fort Stikine.The Fort Stikine was a vessel which the British Ministry of War transport had taken over under Lease-Lend. The Port Line acted as managers of the vessel for the Ministry. In accordance with normal practice she was assigned tothe Bibby Line for a voyage to India. She left Birkenhead on the 24th February,1944, with cargo for Karachi and Bombay. The cargo for Karachi was com-posed of aeroplanes, R.A.F. and general stores, explosives and ammunition. the cargo for Bombay consisted of 1,395 tons of explosives and ammunition and someService stores. She reached Karachi on the 30th March, 1944, where she dis-charged part of her cargo. The empty spaces were filled with new cargo forBombay. This cargo had been booked by the British India S.N. Company, asthe Bibby Line had no berth on the Indian coast. It consisted mainly of cotton,but included also timber, lubricating oil, some resin and sulphur and various other commodities. The Ministry of War Transports Representative at Karachiknew of the main commodities to be loaded cotton and timber and had authorised their loading. Certain other commodities were loaded by the operators of the ship following the normal practice. The Commission describes the methodof taking on cargo as haphazard. Neither the Master nor the Chief Officer whowas in charge of the stowage made any protest about the cargo taken, but theSecond Officer gave evidence that the Chief Officer (killed in the explosion) wasworried about the cotton. Before the Fort Stikine left Karachi all the fire-fighting appliances were tested. The vessel sailed on the 9th April, 1944, and arrived at Bombay on the 12th April.Under the byelaws of the Bombay Port Trust, a ship carrying explosives isnot allowed into the docks, but under Rule 88 of the Defence of India Rules thisbyelaw is suspended in cases in which the military officer appointed for thatpurpose has given a certificate of grave urgency. Such a certificate was given inthe case of the Fort Stikine. No explosives or ammunition were off-loaded untilthe ship had been alongside for 24 hours, that is, until about midday on the13th April.IV. The Fire on the s.s. Fort Stikine.On the 14th April fire broke out in No. 2 hold, in which cotton was stowed.The alarm was raised at 1-50 p.m., but the outbreak might have occurred earlier,since no effective watch was kept on the ship during the refreshment hour from12-30 to 1-30 p.m. At first the fire was not thought serious and there was some delay in calling the Fire Brigade. When the seriousness of the fire was realised,Colonel Sadler, General Manager of the Docks, came on board; also Mr. Coombe,Head of the Fire Brigade Services; Mr. Willson, Deputy Conservator of thePort Trust; Commander Longmire, R.I.N., Chief Salvage Officer; and CaptainOberst, an Officer attached to the Indian Army Ordnance Corps. These officersexpressed divergent opinions as to the course of action to be taken and the master could not make up his mind. Meanwhile, 32 hoses were playing into the[28187] b 2
lower hold from the main hatchway and an unsuccessful attempt had been madeto get at the fire by cutting a hole in the side of the ship.There is little doubt that the water projected into the lower hold floatedsome of the burning cotton upwards, thereby bringing it towards the underside ofthe magazines and increasing the heat there until ignition took place. At about-45 some of the explosives must have ignited, as smoke and fierce flamesappeared. At 3-50 p.m. the firemen were ordered to withdraw. No steps had beentaken to batten down No. 4 hatch, which contained explosives more dangerous and in greater, quantity than those in No. 2. No effective warning was given toany other ship in the &quot;docks and the Fort Stikine was not flying the. red flag-indicating that she had explosives on board. At 4-6 p.m., when the firemen were still quite near the Fort Stikine, there was a terrific explosion. government house, the Bombay Municipality, Police Headquarters, the Chairman of thePort Trust and Naval Headquarters thereby received their first intimation that something unusual had happened. The Commission^ Second Report will beginfrom this point, dealing with the inadequacy of the action taken after the disaster. At 4-33 a second explosion occurred with the detonation of No. 4hold.   The total casualties in the disaster include at least 900 killed and missing.V. -Findings of the Commission.The Commission found that the causes of the disaster were as follows : 1. The existence of a state of war, resulting in the practice of bringing intodocks ships laden with explosives and ammunition. The Commission agree,however, that there is no practical alternative. The real need is for proper and adequate safety precautions.2.&apos; The stowage of the s.s. Fort Stikine at Karachi in such a way that cottonwas stowed, above and below explosives.A number of witnesses expressed the view that stowage of cotton withexplosives was dangerous. The master stevedore in charge of the stowage,however, did not agree with this view, and neither the Master nor the Chief Officerprotested against loading cotton, though they did refuse to load a parcel ofturpentine.3.   The accidental ignition of the cotton in No. 2 lower hold.In the absence of any suggestion of sabotage, it is concluded that the fire wasaccidental, and by far the most probable cause is the carelessness of someonesmoking in that hold. There is evidence that although some of the oil drumswere leaking the cotton was not contaminated.4. Failure at the outset of the fire by those present in authority to realisetue gravity m cue situation ana uicn liiumc ulu mg une course ui tut; nre to ta^eenergetic steps to extinguish the fire or to avert the disaster by some other means.It was the duty of the Master and the ship&apos;s officers to have made certainthat the Fire Brigade Services were at once informed that a dangerous fire had broken out and similarly to inform the Bombay Port Trust. The Master shouldhave made an immediate request for tugs to stand by in case it was decided tomove the ship out of the harbour. It is probable that had the holds been batteneddown and the ship taken out the explosion would have been delayed, although this would have been a hazardous undertaking. If she had been scuttled at 2 p.m.she could not have gone down more than 4 ft. and at no time during the period2 p.m. to 4 p.m. would the lower hold have been filled by scuttling the ship. Iffire-fighting was the course to be pursued, the only certain &quot;method of extinguishingthe fire was to get directly at its heart with water at all costs and, if this failed,to flood the hold as quickly as possible, to use open-ended hoses and every availablepump.   The most effective means were never employed.5. The absence at the fire of a centralised executive control with power toissue paramount orders and co-ordinate the various authorities and services concerned.Colonel Sadler thought that the Fort Stikine should have been taken out ofthe harbour; Mr. Willson would have scuttled the ship; the Master was anxiousto preserve the ship; and the Chief of the Fire Brigade to extinguish the fire.If there had been present at any time one man strong enough to assume command the disaster would have been modified or even averted.
The Commission also concluded that the action taken before or during the disaster was inadequate in the following respects : (1) At Karachi the Deputy Ministry of War Transport Representative,Mr. Knott, did not exercise any control or supervision from the pointof view of safety when commercial cargo was to be stowed in thes.s. Fort Stikine, already partially laden with explosives.The Report states that the vested interests of peace-time influence,even if they do not govern, the war-time control of Ministry ships in indian waters. The want of knowledge and lack of supervision over,and by, Mr. Knott resulted in there being put on board a cargo sostowed as to make the Fort Stikine an unsafe ship. The dual capacityof Mr. Knott as Deputy Representative of the Ministry of war transport and as partner in Messrs. Mackinnon, Mackenzie and Co.placed him in a position in which his duty and his financial interest might be in conflict. Mr. Knott was acquitted of any intention ofmaking any improper profit for his firm out of his position, but it isthought that he failed to realise the scope and obligations of hisposition and consequently allowed peace-time standards of dealingwith commercial cargo to apply to a Ministry ship carrying explosivesin bulk. It is wrong that the Ministry&apos;s Deputy Representative atKarachi should be wholly ignorant about the safety precautions inrelation to the stowage of explosives in ships and in general the supervision over Ministry of War Transport Representatives is not satisfactory. The Commission do not wish to be taken as condemningthe system by which arrangements have been made for the control ofthe Ministry&apos;s ships in Indian ports, since it is outside their terms ofreference. Nevertheless, they state that in Karachi the system hasresulted in an administrative organisation which is in some degreeresponsible for what occurred in the Fort Stikine. The loyalty andpatriotism of the Masters of merchant ships may induce them to stowwith explosives cargoes potentially dangerous but which they believe to be necessary in the furtherance of the war effort, and which M.W.T.impliedly allows them so to believe. The Master should be told when a cargo which he is expected to stow in a Ministry ship with explosivesis not being shipped as part of the war effort but in order to maintainthe normal commercial life of the community, as was the case withthe cotton.(2) At Bombay there was a failure to inform, by the regulation red flag, theother ships in the Victoria Dock that the Fort Stikine was laden withexplosives.(3) No adequate steps were taken to ensure that matches, lighters or smokingmaterials were not taken on board ships carrying explosives as is done in magazine areas on shore.(4) There was a lack of co-ordination between the ship&apos;s anti-sabotage guardand the civilian watchmen in the ship, resulting in a haphazard andinsufficient watch being kept when the hatches were open.(5) By dismantling the main engines for repairs it was impossible for the fort Stikine to move under her own steam although at all materialtimes1 she had sufficient steam to be able to move herself.(6) There was lack of co-ordination between the civil police and the militaryfield security personnel.(7) On the discovery of the outbreak of fire at Bombay there was a failure to appreciate the gravity of the situation or even to summon the fire brigade Services until 2-16 p.m.The Commission found it difficult to discover any mitigatingcircumstances so far as the Master and the Officers are concerned inthe failure to see that the Fire Brigade Services had been notified.(8) No. 2 message (signifying a serious fire) was not immediately despatched to the Control Room of the Fire Brigade Services.(9) There was a failure to take energetic steps either to get water at the heart of the fire or to batten down No. 2 hold, tun i on the steaminjectors and take s.s. Fort Stikine out of the docks.The situation which had been allowed to develop in the firstinstance, because of the failure of the Master and the Officers to takethe right steps, was beyond the knowledge of the training of the fire brigade Services.[28187] b 3
(10) The Tire Brigade Services&apos; gas-cutting apparatus or its manipulationwas defective and failed to cut any hole in the side of the ship whenthe attempt was made.(11) There is no method or alarm-signal by which a dock or docks can be cleared of non-essential personnel, and it did not occur to the CivilPolice or to anybody to give any general warning to other ships in the dock of the impending explosion.It is apparent that, except in the case of an air raid, no situation has ever been envisaged which might call for the rapid clearance of unessential persons. When to those in authority it was apparent that disaster was inevitable it occurred to no one to adopt the elementary but recognised expedient of sounding continuous blastson the ship&apos;s own siren. Failing the existence of a general alarmsj^stem, some person at the scene of the fire should have warnedshipping that a serious explosion was impending. The omission byany of the bystanders at the fire to perform a simple public dutydoes not, however, relieve the Civil Police of the ultimate responsi-bility for issuing this warning.(12) The failure to cover the hatchways of Nos. 4 and 5 holds after theoutbreak of fire in No. 2 hold left a direct means of access for the spread of the fire to the explosives in No. 4 hold.The precaution of battening down the upper hatchways of Nos. 4and 5 holds ought to have been taken and the available steam, whichwas not being: used, turned into No. 4 hold by means of the steaminjectors. There was a slender chance of the second explosion beingaverted but this vanished when there was a ready means of access forthe spread of the fire through the open hatchways.(13) Neither the  Commodore,  R.I.N.,  nor  the Naval  Officer-in-Charge,Bombay, to whom authority was given under the Defence of India. Rules to order a ship on fire in the docks to be scuttled or beached,was informed of the fire.Neither the Port Trust, Commodore Rattray (COMRIN), norCaptain Curtis (NOIC), can be absolved from some responsibilityfor the failure to implement the regulation by some procedure whichwould ensure that they were informed when a ship was on fire in the docks. Between the 14th April, 1939, and the 14th April, 1944, therehad been 60 fires in ships in the docks at Bombay, 15 of which were carrying explosives.(14) The laws, byelaws, regulations and rules concerning docks, fires and.explosives are unco-orclinated, resulting in the failure of personnelconcerned either to know or to appreciate or to act upon them.The Fortress Commander, Bombay, was empowered to exercise the powers conferred by Rule 88. It is not clear how this authoritycame to be delegated to a representative of the EmbarkationCommandant, Bombay. The Ministry of War Transport have issuedthree pamphlets on stowage of explosives. Cotton is not mentionedin these pamphlets but the dangerous character of cotton as cargo is supported not only by Indian experience but also by the fact thatcotton may not be carried in pilgrim ships. Fires in ships withexplosives in the docks concern so many interests and Services that aco-ordinated plan of action for dealing with them was necessary, andif with a centralised control with power to issue paramount orderssuch a plan had been prepared and acted upon the disaster might havebeen mitigated or averted.
iooAPPENDIX B.RESOLUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA ATTACHED TOREPORT OF THE COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY INTO THE BOMBAYDISASTER.1. In Resolution No. 8-P (29)/44, elated the 2nd May, 1944, the Governor-General in Council appointed a Commission of Enquiry, with the Honourable theChief Justice of the Bombay High Court as President, to enquire into and reporton the causes of the fire and explosions in Bombay dock on the 14th April, 1944,and into adequacy of the action taken before, during and after the disaster. Theproceedings took place in camera, and in the interests of expediency and security the witnesses were sworn to secrecy and no legal representation of any interested-parties was permitted. The Commission commenced taking evidence on the8th May, 1944, and their first Report, which covers the events and action taken up to the first explosion at 1606 hours on the day of the disaster, is now published.The Government of India have carefully considered the suggestions and criticismscontained in the Report. In the observations that follow they have dealt with the precautions and remedial action considered by the Commission to be necessary andthe measures to be taken to ensure that they are adequate and are strictly enforced.2. The Commission have pointed out that war necessitates considerablemovement of explosives and ammunition in bulk, and that the discharge of suchdangerous cargo in docks or alongside wharves is in many cases unavoidable andis practised in other countries of the British Empire. Although they considerthat the bringing of explosives into docks in war-time is a primary cause of the disaster, it is not their opinion that there is any practical alternative to it. Theyobserve that &quot; the real need is the setting up, and enforcing, of proper and adequate safety precautions.&quot; The Government of India agree. They also acceptthe other findings, viz., that the method of the stowage at Karachi of cottonabove and below explosives and ammunition on s.s. Fort Stikine was one of the primary causes of disaster, that the possibility of deliberately planned sabotagecannot be seriously entertained, that by far the most probable cause of the ignitionin the cotton was the careless discarding of a cigarette or other smoking material,and that there was failure to appreciate the gravity of the situation at outset.3. The Commission have also come to the conclusion that the absence ofan officer with power to issue paramount orders and to co-ordinate the variousauthorities and services concerned was one of the primary causes of the disaster.Under orders issued by the Central Government, the Naval Officer-in-Charge andCommodore, Royal Indian Navy, had been given concurrent powers to give directions, when a ship was on fire or had suffered damage and constituted a danger to other vessels in port, to the owner or master requiring him to scuttleor beach the vessel. These orders were known to the officers concerned and to the deputy Conservator of the Port, but neither the Commodore nor the naval officer-in-Charge received information of the fire and the Deputy Conservatoronly came to know that the fire was a serious one at a very late stage, when hepromptly hastened to the spot. Fie omitted, however, to inform the naval officer-in-Charge, with whom he normally maintains close liaison. It is open to doubt whether, having regard to the delays that occurred in giving informationof the serious nature of the fire to the Deputy Conservator and uncertainty asto the time it would take for the ammunition to explode, the notification of thedanger to the Naval Officers and their presence could have entirely averted thetragedy which took place. They could not have been of much assistance in fire-fighting, which was the responsibility of the Chief Officer of the Fire Brigade,but it is reasonable to suppose that they might, by the issue of warnings to other ships and to personnel in the docks, have mitigated the effects of the explosions.The Government of India agree that there was a lacuna which needed to be filledup by orders as to when, how and by whom the Naval Officer-in-Charge and other authorities concerned should be informed of a fire; and necessary action in thematter has already been taken.4. In Chapter IV the Commission have drawn attention to a number of points on which the action taken was inadequate or in respect of which regulationsmust be laid down or revised.  These include the need for warning other ships by
the hoisting of a red flag by day and a red light by night on a ship carrying-explosives when in harbour-/the necessity for precautions to ensure that matchesand other smoking materials are not allowed on or near a ship carrying explosivesor dangerous cargo; the importance of ensuring that there is adequateco-ordination between a ship&quot;s anti-sabotage guard and civilian watchmen whenhatches are open; the importance of ensuring that a ship carrying dangerouscargo can be moved at any time during discharge without undue delay; and theimportance of setting up&apos; a mechanical alarm system by which ships and dockpersonnel can be warned. Certain omissions on the part of the master of theship and the fire services have also been referred to, and the failure of the gas-cutting appliance condemned. The cause of the failure of the appliance is still not known. As regards acts of omission by the fire services, the Government ofIndia are inclined to agree with the view taken in paragraph 115 of the Report,that the situation which had been allowed to develop was beyond their knowledge and training. It is gratifying to know that, whatever omissions may have,occurred, officers of all services concerned displayed the most praiseworthyheroism in discharge of their duties.5. As regards the other matters referred to in the preceding paragraph, very soon after the Bombay explosions the Government of India in the War Departmentset up a technical committee, known as the Dangerous Cargoes (Ports) Committee,to examine the adequacy of existing regulations on the subject of the handling of dangerous cargoes at major ports and to enquire into the local dispositionsand machinery for the enforcement of the regulations. This Committee has completed its investigations at all major ports and. after considering the points referred to in the Report, has drawn up regulations which will have to be observed by all concerned while ships carrying petroleum or explosives are in port. these regulations, which have been issued, as well as port fire regulations, which have.been revised at each port in consultation with the naval and military authorities,will cover &quot;all important matters referred to in the report except the methods ofstowage which are dealt with in paragraph 6 below. All port authorities havebeen directed to put in working order a mechanical alarm system. Immediatelyafter the explosions the Naval Officers-in-Charge issued a notice on masters ofships directing them to communicate immediately with them in the event of any emergency likely to endanger a ship. A similar direction in case of fire will beincluded in revised fire-fighting regulations.6. A standing sub-committee on transport by sea of the Explosive storage and Transport Committee in the United Kingdom has since the beginning of thewar regularly reviewed the general question of the loading of types of cargowhich are normally regarded as safe but which when loaded with explosives might give rise to danger. A sub-committee of the Dangerous Cargoes Committee inIndia has this question under consideration, as also the supervision of cargo atIndian ports on ships carrying explosives or ammunition. The Ministry of war transport had, soon after the explosion and without waiting for the Corn-mission^ report, issued provisional instructions as to the precautions to be takenwhen cotton is loaded in ships carrying explosives. The Commerce department has taken similar action in respect of Indian tonnage.7. The Commission have commented on mistakes made and on inadequateaction taken by individual officers. In assessing blame the Commission observein paragraph 59 of their Report: &quot; We are in a favourable position to judgewhat ought to have been done, whereas the actions which it has been our duty to submit to searching scrutiny were taken either under stress of everyday affairs or in the heat and turmoil of a desperate situation.&quot; Some of the officers referredto have perished in the disaster, while those living have not had an opportunityof being informed of the comments that have been made by the Commission or ofbeing heard in their defence. In the circumstances Government of Indiarefrain from making any observations and they are confident that any actionwhich may on enquiry be found to be justified will be taken by the appropriatecivil or military authority concerned.8. The Commission have made a number of statements regarding theBritish Ministry of War Transport and its Representative in India. As regardsthese the Government of Tndia have been in consultation with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, who point out that, as a result of the procedure which was adopted for the reasons set out in the opening paragraph, there was no means of knowingwhat evidence was being given to the Commission or of testing its accuracy by
cross-examination. Since, as a consequence, the Report contains misconceptionsabout the activities and responsibilities of the Ministry of War Transport, HisMajesty&apos;s Government have asked that a clear statement of the facts so far asthey relate to the Ministry of War Transport should be made public. The FortStikine. was a ship registered in the name of His Majesty represented by theMinister of War Transport. In accordance with settled practice she wasassigned for the voyage in question to the Bibby Line as operators under theMinistry&apos;s Liner Requisition Scheme notified to Parliament in 1940. One of the bases of the Scheme is the utilisation of the skill, the experience and the facilities of existing organisations of liner companies. Accordingly the booking of cargoat Karachi was arranged by the B.I.S.N. Company, since the Bibby Line had noberth on the Indian coast.. In paragraph 97 of the Report the Commission havestated that they have &quot; shown how it comes about that the vested interests ofpeace-time come to influence, even if they do not govern, the wartime control ofMinistry ships in Indian waters carrying explosives on their way to a theatre ofwar.&apos;&quot; It is not correct that vested interests of peace-time have influenced orgoverned the war-time control of Ministry ships in India. Throughout the war,the British Ministry of War Transport have been under constant pressure from theGovernment of India to supply shipping assistance toward the maintenance ofthe Indian economy and the programmes of shipment of Indian coastal cargoeshave been under constant review between the Indian Shipping Controller andthe British Ministry of War Transport Representative in India. The ministry have authorised their Representative in India to make the fullest practicableuse for local service of any available space in overseas ships which may passbetween Indian ports, especially as the maintenance of the economic life of india is an essential part of the war effort. When, therefore, it was found that the fort Stikine would have available space on the voyage from Karachi to Bombay,the Ministry&apos;s Representative readily made this space available for the shipment of coastal cargo. Though normal peace-time machinery was utilised for the actualbooking and loading of cargo, and though these services were paid for by way ofa commission on freights, the operators had no financial interest in the resultsof the voyage or any financial incentive in the choice of individual parcels. Ofthe cargo shipped at Karachi, cotton had admittedly very high priority, the textile Commissioner, Bombay, having recommended &quot; that any available space in any ship should be utilised for the movement of this priority commodity fromKarachi to Bombay subject only to naval and military operational considera-tions.&quot; Timber is also a high-priority cargo and the particular parcel shippedwas intended for a specific purpose of high strategic importance. The lubricating-cating oil was oil discharged at Karachi from an American Army transport withBombay as its final destination. The sulphur was shipped to the Shipping Officer,Bombay, on behalf of the Supply Department Qf the Government of India. Fishmanure was also an essential commodity for Indian agriculture. Whateveranswers may have been elicited from witnesses, the position, in fact, is that the priorities of cotton and timber were so well established that no question arose asto whether they should be carried from that point of view.9. In paragraph 75 of the Report the Commission find the crux of the whole situation in the statements of two master mariners that rules and regulations&quot;have been absolutely scrapped&quot; or &quot;gone by the board.&quot; These statementshowever, are incorrect. Loading of explosives and other dangerous goods in theUnited Kingdom is done in accordance with the advice of a body of eminentexperts. Their advice is incorporated in departmental documents which are issued by the British Ministry of War Transport and which are also used asguides by the Indian authorities. Though in the interests of the war effort therules have in certain respects mainly in regard to the quantity of explosives thatmay be carried, in one ship heen modified where modification could with safetybe permitted, in other respects the rules have been tightened up as war experience has shown this to be necessary. Statutory responsibility for safe loading in indian ports does not rest upon the Ministry of War Transport and, while it isno doubt true that the Ministry&apos;s representatives in overseas ports would not tolerate an admixture of cargoes which was obviously dangerous, reliance mustin the main be placed upon the local shipping authorities and upon masters ofships upon whom, apart from statute, rests the primary responsibility for seeingto the safety of ships. In the particular case of the Fort Stikine no protest wasmade by the Master or the Chief Officer as to the cargo actually loaded, though they did exercise their rights in rejecting a parcel of turpentine which wastendered for shipment but which they considered dangerous.
10. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot accept the implication contained inthe following passage : &quot;Even so questions of policy are involved which would necessitate theconsideration of whether the Ministry of War Transport and its representa-tives are entitled to exclude from consideration the fact that the.loyalty,patriotism, and high courage of the masters of merchant ships may overcometheir discretion as experts and induce them to take and stow with explosivescargoes potentially dangerous but which they believe to be necessary in the furtherance of the war effort and which the Ministry impliedly allows them so to believe. It may be a debatable point whether if, as Mr. Lemansuggests, the master is in effect the arbiter of safe stowage, he should be toldwhen the cargo which he is expected to stow - in a Ministry ship withexplosives is not being shipped as part of the war effort but in order to main-tain the normal commercial life of the community, particularly in caseswhere it is known in advance that the ship must ultimately discharge indocks and not in midstream.&quot;It is wholly incorrect that masters are deceived, with the connivance of theMinistry, into carrying unessential and potentially dangerous cargo by being ledto believe that cargo is being shipped as part of the war effort. Furthermore, itis common ground with His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of india that the maintenance of the civil economy of India is an essential part of thewar effort.11. In conclusion, the Governor-General in Council desires to take this opportunity of expressing his appreciation of services rendered by the president and the members of the Enquiry Commission in conducting the enquiry. TheirReport has been of great assistance to him in assessing the position and decidingupon the action required.
