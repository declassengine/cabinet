THIS DOCfUKEOT IS THE PROPERTY OP BOS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.        1 - ^It is issued for the personal use of.......^^^^r^^r^r^.....TOP SECRET Copy N0.....Lv/.p.(aa) 33425TH SEPTEMBER, 19hhWAR CABINETTEE FUTURE SCALE OF ATTACK BY PLYING BOMBS ANDROCKETS ON THIS COUNTRY.Honort by the Chiefs of StaffEstimat00 ecale of flying bomb attack in the present state of om   information,  the only threat to this country by flying bombs is by air launching.2.        If air launchings are confined to He.Ill aircraft then the maximum radius of action from London at which they could operate, making allowance for the range of the flying bombitself, would be h80 miles.      An arc of a circle of this radiusfrom London includes the Southern half of Denmark and bases asfar East as Magdeburg and Nurnberg.      The number of He.111aircraft believed to h ve been modified to carry the flyingbomb is about 30,  i.e.   the aircraft of one Gruppe.      It isunlikeljr that more than 20 of these aircraft will be immediately available to operate at any one time.3.        There is some evidence of experiments with other types of aircraft for launching the flying bomb.      If the Do.217, Fw.200or the He.177 were used for this purpose, suitable bases couldbe found in Norway, Denmark, and the greater part of Germany;the likely scale of attack by flying bombs would beproportionately increased.      There is however no evidence ofany such conversion in operational units.h.        Aircraft which have launched flying bombs in the past havemade use of a combination of visual beacons and dead reckoningnavigation.      If, as now seems likely,  the enemy is forced away from coastal landmarks, he can make use of any one of fiveknown systems of radio navigational aids without materiallyaffecting the accuracy he has- edready obtained in his attacks on London.      There may even be a slight improvement, so long-as the necessary radio stations are sited within about 350miles oi  the target.

5. It may be possible that the enemy will launchflying bombs against important targets on the East Coast,such as Hull or the Tyneside ports.      The inherent accuracy of the weapon is so poor, however,  and the area of thepossible objectives so relatively small for this form of attack that this threat need not be seriously considered.6. During the period hth to 23rd September inclusive,the number of flying bombs launched against this country has amounted to 85.      Of these the daily average of flyin bombs falling in the London Defence Region has been 0.53*It is considered that the average scale of launchings inthe immediate future may amount to about 20 on suitablenights,  of which about four only would be likely to reach the London Defence Region.      This scale of attack might be gradually increased if the enemy decided to devoteadditional bombers to the task.      On the other hand, as weadvance into Germany,  we approach closer to the enemy aerodromes,  and force his aircraft to fly over territoryoccupied by us or to circumvent it;    we shall thus add tothe length and hazards of his flights.Bstimated scale of rocket attach7. The land situation in -Holland on the25th September has been estimated by the War Office  to beas follows:-&quot;(i)    It is anticipated that by 25th Septemberthere will have been no major change in thepresent line held by our own troops in Holland,with the exception of the general wideningof the corridor.( ii)    Below is the estimat c-d line -Weert - Deurne - Mill - Mooh - Groesbeek -Nigmegen - Huissen - - Am hem - Batenburg -Heesch - Boxtel - Rethy - thence line ofEscaut     Meuse Junction Canal to Antwerp -thence line of River Scheldt to T emeu sen.(iii)    It is pointed out that the line given abovedoes NOT mean that allied troops are inoccupation in strength along its entire length,but that our troops will be holding strong points at the main centres of communicationsthroughout11.The line mentioned in paragraph 7  (ii)  above is indicatedon the attached map.8. Our intelligence, particularly of the enemy&apos;s rockettrials, and the fact that in order to attack London the enemy has positioned hia launching sites on the extreme   Westerncoast of Holland,  indicate very strongly that the normaloperational range of the A.h rochet is 200 miles.      Adraittedly,&apos;there has been one rocket which covered a distance of 215miles in the recent attacks on London.9* Our scientific experts state that it should be technically possible to achieve a mean range of about 2h0miles without alteration to the existing design.     There isno pro of, however,  that the Germans have been able to do this.

10. In the light of the Y/ar Office appreciation quoted above-, it seems that the possible Rocket launching areaswithin range of London will not be cut off from Germany by25th September.     Until we have finally over-run the wholeof Holland, West of a line running North and South throughEindhoven, it will still be possible for thorn to firerockets.11. It should be noted, however,  that except for onerocket fired on the evening of the 18th September, norockets have reached England since we commenced our air-borne landings in Holland.      Owing to the general state ofdisorganisation especially as affecting eommunicat ions inthis area it seems likely that few more rockets will befired, at London.Publicity re garding rockets.12. Up to date,   the enemy has made no mention of hisrocket attacks on London.      The main value to the enemy ofthis weapon would be in disseminating propaganda withthe object of raising the morale of his fighting forces.While rocket attacks were in progress it was likely thatany public announcement on our part would have been thesignal for a general outburst of enemy propaganda.13* It is almost certain that some information as tothe fall of long range rockets lias reached the enemythrough diplomatic channels.      Furthermore, as a resultof essential operations by our own special intelligence,vague reports indicating the arrival of the rocket in thiscountry have doubtless reached Germany.ILi. On the other hand, once a public announcement ofthe fall of rockets were made in this country, we shouldhave difficulty in restraining the Press from publishinginformation of value to the enemy, such as we experienced in regard to flying bomb incidents.      It is certain thatsome information regarding the fall of shot, or the technicalperformance of the weapon would eventually reach the enemy.It is equally certain that this would be of value to him,if he were able to continue rocket attacks either againstLondon or targets elsewhere.15. It is concluded that as soon as our land forces are firmly in control of East to West communications ona line running North-South through Eindhoven to theZuider Zee,  there would be no.strong operational objectionto making a public statement.      It is therefore recommendedthat there should be no public statement on rocket firingat present and that the position be reviewed again in a week&apos;st irae.16. It is suggested that if the Prime Minister&apos;s reviewof the war situation makes any reference to the presentattacks, this should be confined to a statement indicating the scale of attacks now being experienced from both rocketand flying bomb,  and that no specific reference to the rocketshould be made.(Iiit Id)    A.F.B..CP.E.N.S., for First Sea Lord,Offices of the War Cabinet,S.W.   1.2$th September, 19U4* --x.
