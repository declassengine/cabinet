This note deals with the admissionof France to the European Advisory Commission.Please accept, Mr. Secretary of State, the assurance of my very highconsideration.(Signed) J. PARIS.The Right Hon.

Paris&apos; Note.In connexion with the communication addressed on the 25th July by thePresident of the European Advisory Commission to the French Charge d&apos;attack &apos;airesat London, the Provisional Government of the French Republic took theopportunity to emphasise the supreme importance which it attached to being-associated with the discussions which are being carried on between the American,British and Soviet Governments with regard to the terms of the armistice withGermany, and, more generally, the essential importance for France of everythingconcerning the German problem.The French Government is now established at its normal place in the capital,whence the victories of the Allied Armies with the assistance of the whole french people have driven the enemy, and has been confirmed in its mission by the unanimous and enthusiastic adherence of the liberated population while awaiting the moment when it will be possible to hold free elections. The ProvisionalGovernment has a duty to draw the attention of the Governments at Washington,12526   [28281]
London and Moscow to a question, the solution of which is made urgent by the rapid pace of military operations. If the problem of German capitulation is of prime importance to France, she cannot at the same time disinterest herself fromthe other European questions which will be raised by the collapse of the Reich;from the restoration of the States invaded by Germany; and from the eventualdelimitation of new frontiers. Nor can she disinterest herself from the general question of the re-establishment of fruitful and peaceful relations between theStates of the Continent. All these are questions with which the european advisory Commission will be concerned during the weeks to come.The Provisional Government has consequently the honour to ask theAmerican, British and Soviet Governments for admission to a seat, in theCommission, in order that France may take her part in the task of the reconstruc-tion and reorganisation of Europe.The Provisional Government, feeling entitled to believe that its request willaccord with the views of these Governments, will hasten as soon as an invitationhas been given to it to appoint a representative on the Commission.
