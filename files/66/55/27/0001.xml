..P.(hh) 527 / qV19TH S&apos;P7AT35R;  1910-1.. COPY HO.WAR CA3I-ET:?:L:A&apos;&quot;ICS Pa/   -VI- VIVVAQES II   SV-GE memorandum &quot;by the Chancellor of the exchequer.     My colleagues will recollect that at the cabinet meeting held on 5th September, 19hh, provisional agreement wasreached on a scheme of financial &quot;benefits for men retained forfurth&apos; r service with the Armed &quot;Corces after the defeat ofGermany.      This scheme providedj-(a) increase   of pay ranging from 1s. to 3s. a day for all those officers and men who had completed three years1service with the Armed Forces during the war togetherwith further progressive increases in respect of eachyear&apos;s further war service.(b) A special allowance in addition to (a) for officers andmen who uncle: take service in the Far East.(i) For- officers and men paid under the Indian pay code the allowance would range from 1s.  a day for men in the lowest ranks to 3s. a day for officers up tc and including the rank of Captainand Plight Lieutenant.      In view of the substantialbenefits received by officers above the rank ofCaptain or Flight Lieutenant in receipt of payunder the-  Indian Pay Code the special allowance would not extend above these ranks.(ii) For men paid at British rates the allowances would be ; -Officers - all ranks hs.6d-.  a dayWarrant Officers Class I . 2s. 6d.  a dayWarrant Officers Class II 2s.        a dayStaff Sargeants and Flight Sergeants 1s.6d. a daySergeant 1s.3d. a dayRanks below Sergeant 1s.        a day2.      Particulars of this scheme have been communicated tothe Prime Minister who has signified his agreement to the general increase at (a) above and to the proposals relating to officersand men in receipt of pay under the Indian Pay Code ((b) (i) above).&apos;He has expressed the view, however, that the scale of allowances in respect of Far East service proposed for officers paid at british rates  ((b)(ii) above) makes inadequate provision for thevarious steps of rank.3.     The Service Departments have also reached the con-clusion that substantial improvement is required in this part ofthe scheme.      As a result of discussions between officials, thefollowing alternative scheme has been devised in substitution for(b)(ii).      A Japanese Campaign Allowance for officers of all three Services at the following rates:-

General Officers (uacl equivalent) 11s. a day)Colonels                   &quot;           &quot; 9s. a day) subject toLieut-Colonels         11           &quot; 7s. a day) income taxMajors                        &quot;           &quot; Ks.Captains                    &quot;           &quot;day,aria officers of lower rank 3s.  a day^The rates for men below commissioned rank would be as in(b)(ii) suoject to downward adjustment of the rates for warrant officers to take account of the new proposal for a separate &quot;far east Allowance.U-      la addition zo trie above -allowance Army; and R.A.r.officers would be granted a combined Field and Colonial allow-ance ca the lines of the presentfollowing rates (to be known asOfficersWarrant Officers Class IWarrant Officers Class IIStaff SergeantsSergeantsSank below Sergeant.t.

The- cost of the revised scheme will be substantially higher than that of the scheme to which my colleagues have already given their provisional approval *      Nevertheless, if it is agreedthat it is essential to the successful prosecution&apos;of the campewignagainst Japan to pay allowances at these rates I am prepared togive it my assent.&quot;mediterranean Allowance at theFar Sast Allowance).3s. a daynot subjectto income tax.shore in India- and Ceylonpay at British rates a3s. 9d. a day.      This;ueit and those eligible for itDate of introduction7.      My colleagues have already agreed that the introductionof the proposed improvements should not be deferred until after an&apos; armistice with Germany but should take effect from a current-date, s   -.8.      The Minister of Labour on the other hand and the War1Office are in favour of introducing the new benefits with effect from the 3rd September last,      I understand, however, that theAir Ministry arid admiralty would find it administrativelydifficult to arrange for,payments of the increased amounts thatwill fall due under these proposals before about the 1stNovember next.      In vie,: of their experience in connection withthe payment&quot;, of the -increases approved by the Government in april last, they have represented tint unless the new payments can beissued immediately they become due there may be complaints whichhowever ill founded will detract from the effects which thebenefits are designed to secure.        They have accordingly suggestedthat the effective date of introduction of the new increases shouldbe the 1st November.      Moreover, the Secretary of State for india has represented that the increased purchasing pov/er which willbecome- available as a result of the introduction of the proposedbenefits will seriously increase the danger of inflation in Indiaand has asked that urgent steps e.g. an increase in the supplyof commodities in canteens in India- and other measures should betaken with a view to combating this danger.      It will be quite impossible to put these measures into effect for- several weeks andan issue of higher rates of pay and allowances to personnelserving in India with retrospective effect from the 3rdSeptember cannot but seriously increase existing inflationary

9.      Finally, one cannot over-look the effect of an early date upon the troops now fighting in the &quot; -eat and upon the public whoseattention is concentrn ed on that fighting.      While the mainstruggle continues in Europe and while service-in the Far Eastis not involving special retention in the Forces at a time whenothers are &quot;being demobilised,  it will not be easy to justifyspecial financial compensation restricted to those who happen to(     be serving at the moment in the Far S st.      In the circumstances would press my colleagues strongly to agree to some deferment(      of the new benefits and I v/ould suggest that they should notin any case come into effect before 1st November next.10,      There is a further point on which a decision isrequired.   - The Prime Minister in a personal telegram has asked that consideration should be given to an important addition tothe proposals.      He says -&quot;The greatest anxiety of the men who are held in service a the Far jast concerns the probability of re-employmentin the labour market when they ultimately return.      No payinducements alone can fully meet this anxiety.      I amaware of the statutory right to reinstatement but I feelmost strongly that in addition to this and to the releaseleave ana foreign service leave already planned, which in themselves are excellent, we must take a further step inregard to men demobilised when the Japanese war is finallyover, and undertake that any man who is so unfortunateas to fail to secure employment within   the period of hispaid leave should continue to receive his service pay and allowances while unemployed within a period of twelve months/from his demobilisation.      I am aware that it may beimpossible in pTTfctice to confine this benefit to menwho have actually served    in the Far Eastern theatre.      Iam&quot;.aware too that there may be pressure to extend thisbenefit to men who are released in the near future whenhostilities with Germany cease.      The first point I will leave to my colleagues to settle.      On the second, I see no occasion to extend to men released in the near future, whenemployment must ne plentiful:  the concession designed tomeet a very different case when the Japanese war is overand conditions may not be so easy.&quot;11.      I do not know what view my colleagues will take of thissuggestion.      For my part as Chancellor of the Exchequer, while&apos; i recognise that such a provision would be of great assistance in securing willing acceptance of service in the Far East, I feelhound to view the proposal with considerable apprehension.      Thegeneral demobilisation arrangements are already, in my view,adequate and indeed generous,.     To make the further improvementsuggested by the Prime Minister will not only add substantially to the cost but will also introduce a number of seriousc ompli c a ti ons.( 12.      In the first place, as the Prime Minister himselfappreciates,  it may be extremely difficult to restrict theapplication of the proposal to those oho actually serve in theFar Eastern theatre.      Prima facie, all those who &quot;suffer&quot; fromlate demobilisation would appear to lave an equal claim to the concession, without regard to the actual location of their service.    (Secondly, the proposal appears to raise in a somewhatnovel form many of the difficulties formerly associated withthe &quot;genuinely seeking work&quot; condition in the unemployment assistance sphere.      I should have expected the Ministry ofLabour (if, as I assume, the task would fall on that Department)to find it far from easy to determine the type of employment and remuneration to be regarded as appropriate in any particular case.Thirdly, we should be establishing a preferential rate of state assistance for one particular type of unemployed   man which could hardly, bo disguised by regarding the arrangement as a continuation of Service pay and allowances.      Fourthly, continuance of such a

vested right for as long as twelve months wouldprobably cause trouble at the end of the period when an unemployed ex-member of the Forces wouldbe expected to revert to ordinary rates of benefit.13.      For reasons such as these,  I must urge mycolleagues to weigh carefully the disadvantages aswell as the advantages of this particular suggestionbefore they commit themselves to it.&apos;reas ury 0hambera,  3.
