(44) 522.16^/i September, 1944.tWAR CABINET.EXPLOSION IN THE BOMBAY DOCKS ON 14th APRIL, 1944.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry ofWar Transport.AT their meeting on the 11th September the War Cabinet considered aMemorandum by the Minister of Education, W.P. (44) 511, about the BombayExplosion, and decided that the message of confidence which the Minister ofWar Transport proposed to send to Mr. Masson, his Representative in India,for publication in the Indian press, should not be sent until the War cabinet had further considered the matter (see W.M. (44) 121st Conclusions, Minute 2).I have been in telegraphic correspondence with Lord Leathers, who confirmsthat it is imperative in his view that the message should be sent and should bepublished. I attach the telegram which he was proposing to send and which hehas personally approved, subject to any drafting suggestions the Government ofIndia may wish to make.P. J. N.-B.Ministry of War Transport, W. 1,IQth September, 1944.(Draft.)Message to Mr. Masson from Minister of War Transport.1. You have placed in my hands your resignation as my representative in India following the comments of the Commission of Enquiry into the BombayDisaster on the Ministry&apos;s organisation and on your evidence.2. It is clear from the Report of the Commission that their comments onthe Ministry&apos;s organisation and procedure are based on some serious miscon-exceptions, to which it has been necessary to call attention in the statement issuedby the Government of India. As to the Commission^ strictures on the evidence which you gave before them, I am driven to the conclusion that any failure on your part to satisfy the Commission can only have been due to the absence of legal representation which would have ensured proper elucidation of the matters to which the questions put to you were directed.3. I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the services you have rendered as my representative in India in very difficult circumstances, andof assuring you that my confidence in your ability and integrity remainsimdiminished. I shall be glad if you will continue to serve as my representativethere.[28226]
