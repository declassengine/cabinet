THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   September 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 525.19*/i September, 1944.WAR CABINET.THE POST-WAR FIRE SERVICE.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and the Secretary of State for Scotland.1. The National Fire Service was created in August 1941 for war purposes.The statutory basis for the Service is the Fire Services (Emergency Provisions)Act, 1941, and the Regulations made thereunder; and the whole organisation is expressly stated to be for the period of the present emergency.2. In the course of the Debate on the Second Reading of the Bill thefollowing pledge was given by the Home Secretary:  &quot;It is the very definite intention of the Government that it is awar-time expedient only, produced by war conditions .... It is certainlymy very definite view that after the war the fire-fighting forces should again be a local authority service .... It is only fair that this should be so. Thebrigades are taken over for a war-time purpose; and I do not think thereis any reason why, after the war, they should not again become a localservice, subject to the State then making provision for mobilisation on anational basis in the event of a new emergency.&quot;A similar undertaking was given by the Secretary of State for Scotland tothe local authorities in Scotland.Since then the possible need to reconsider the matter has been foreshadowed in a statement made by the Home Secretary in the course of a Debate on the30th June, 1943, in which he said : &quot; Questions have been raised about the future of the National fire service after the war .... I frankly admit that I gave an absolute promise that the brigades would go back to local government. I did not say theywould go back to the same authorities, but I said that they would go back.I am bound to say in all fairness .... the experience of a National fire service has taught us a great deal and we must not be unwilling to thinkagain when we come towards the end of the Avar as to what would be rightto do in the national interest.   The national interest must prevail.&quot;3. The future constitution of the Fire Service for peace-time purposes isone of the matters on which decisions will have to be announced soon after theconclusion of the war in Europe, and it is essential that provisional decisions should be taken on certain questions of policy that arise, so that discussions with various interested parties, and especially with the Associations representingthe local authorities, can be started. The key to the problem is the system ofcontrol, and the object of this Memorandum is to state the principal issues which arise in that connection and the advantages and disadvantages of the various alternatives which need to be considered.  They are four in number : (a) Reversion to the stattis quo under the Fire Brigades Act, 1938;(b) Retention of a National Fire Service;(c) Organisation on the basis of large territorial units, such as : 1(i) Counties and  County Boroughs  (including large Burghs  inScotland) under the control of their respective Councils.[28237]
(ii) Ad hoc areas, constituted with reference to Fire Service require-ments, under the control of indirectly elected authorities,constituted of representatives of the local authorities in each area.The problem is regarded as it affects Great Britain as a whole, and it is recognised that some areas (eg., London and the Highlands of Scotland) may require special arrangements suited to their particular characteristics.Return to the Status quo.4. The legislative basis of the pre-war organisation was the Fire BrigadesAct, 1938. which constituted the Councils of County Boroughs and County urban and Rural Districts (in Scotland Counties and Burghs) as fire authorities; therewere 1,668 such authorities, and the Act laid on each the obligation to provide(or to make the necessary arrangements with other authorities or persons for providing) an efficient Fire&quot; Brigade. The Secretary of State was empoweredto regulate standards of efficiency, conduct inspections and establish a TrainingCoilege; there was, however, no power to prescribe conditions of service of personnel. Default powers were conferred on the Secretary of State acting onthe advice, of a Fire Service Commission. There was no assistance fromExchequer funds.5. The return of the Service to the recently constituted fire authoritiesseemed the natural course at the time the National Fire Service was set up in1941. There was reason to believe that under the new legislation it would havebeen possible to secure a gradual improvement in Service efficiency, and the argument of tradition can certainly be quoted in favour of this course. But inour view there are cogent arguments on the other side, and one in particular,which, in our view, must be regarded as conclusive, namely, that the units ofcontrol are out of keeping with modern technical developments. The modernmotor fire engine is a highly mobile machine and capable of operating over much wider areas than those of the fire authorities of the 1938 Act. Moreover, an effective Fire Service involves the employment of many other forms of mobileequipment which, though they may only be brought into occasional use, are vitally important when the need arises. The provision of equipment of this standard isquite beyond the resources of the Council of the average County Urban and rural district and Small Burgh, and modern fire-fighting technique requires theoperation of these mobile units over large fire areas. There is also the efficiency of the Fire Service personnel to take into account; small authorities cannotprovide adequate training facilities or sufficient practical experience for theirpersonnel, and the training of officers to command and responsibility is quitebeyond them. Nor. indeed, are the small authorities likely to be in a position to attract able and energetic men into the Service, since the commands they can offerare small, and there is no chance of the able man securing a position where hisabilities can be used to the benefit of the Service as a whole. It is true that, in process of time, some of these weaknesses might have been mitigated by meansof the complicated machinery for grouping local authorities for co-operativeworking contemplated in the Fire Brigades Act, but, at the best, this would havebeen a long and tedious process and in certain important respects held out no promise of a successful outcome. For these reasons we consider it out of thequestion to return to the pre-war system of control.Retention of the National Fire Service.6. The National Fire Service has now been established for over three years;it has in many ways demonstrated the advantages of large units of control andthe vital importance, in the interests of efficiency, of certain elements of theorganisation which central direction of the Service has rendered possible. Forexample, there is now an effective system of control, under which all fire stations are linked to higher controls so that the necessary pumps and other appliancescan be speedily deployed to deal with &quot;any fire situation. There is a standardsystem of Service ranks, in contrast to the pre-war state of things where ranksvaried from Brigade to Brigade and one and the same rank meant very differentthings according to the size of the Brigade. There is a standard system oftraining and so of operational methods. This is centred on the National fire service College, and the instruction there forms the basis of the teaching in regional and Area Schools throughout the country, whereas before the wartraining was organised on a Brigade basis and the standards observed varied verywidely.   Appliances and equipment have been brought to a fairly high degree of
standardisation, and they are supplied under central arrangements. The largeoperational commands and units of &quot;administration which have been establishedhave provided scope and opportunities for men of ability which were present in only a few exceptional brigades in pre-war days. The consciousness of belongingto a Crown Service of standing has had distinctly beneficial effects on the morale and efficiency of both officers and men.Organisation on the basis of larger Local Government Areas.7. There are two main alternatives under this head : either the selection of the larger existing Local Government units or the formation of ad hoc joint authorities covering territories suitable for Fire Service administrative and operational purposes. As regards the first of these, the adoption of Counties,County Boroughs and Large Burghs would reduce the number of authorities to 199,55 of them in Scotland; this would in some respects be the simplest form of organisation to bring into effect, but it is by no means an ideal solution. the counties in particular are historical units, their boundaries take little accountof the distribution of population and, on this basis, fire area boundaries wouldfrequently traverse high risk areas which, operationally, should be treated as awhole; a number of the units are individually too small or command insufficientresources to be able to organise a modern Fire Service; and there will always bethe difficulty of adjusting the relations between a County and a County Boroughor Large Burgh situated in the heart of a predominantly rural County, which,on operational considerations, should obviously be under one and the same control.County Councils in England and Wales would come new to Fire Service adminis-tration, and an initial loss of efficiency would be probable, the more so sinceCounty Councils will have heavy burdens in other directions in connection withthe reconstruction programme.Organisation on the basis of ad hoc areas.8. There remains the alternative of constituting indirectly elected ad hocjoint authorities. There are arguments both for and against this course. Itmay be said in favour of it that it would meet the operational requirements whiletechnically honouring the pledges given at the time of nationalisation. Moreover,the joint authority arrangement is one which is already in existence for certain other Services and is being accepted in other directions where units of controlwider than those of existing local authorities are required by the nature of theservices concerned for example, the National Health Service and the proposalsfor the Improvement of Water Supplies; and there is no reason why joint authorities should be less effective in the field of Fire Service administrationthan they are, and are expected to be, in other fields. On the other hand, it maybe objected against this solution that there are no such authorities in being orin prospect, and new authorities would have to be created for this specific purpose;and that indirectly elected joint authorities, though they may be inevitable forsome purposes, are not effective or efficient bodies for the conduct of this kind ofservice. They are remote from the electorate; they finance themselves byprecepting the constituent authorities in a way which prevents effective financial control; and there is often more &quot;joint&quot; than &quot;authority&quot; about them. Itmay be suggested also that one of the main arguments for making a localauthority responsible for a Service such as a Fire Service is the local patriotismand pride which operates as a stimulus to efficiency and progress; and that whileesprit de corps can be secured either in a National Fire Service or in a purely local one it is more difficult to develop it in a Service based on artificialconglomerations of authorities.General Considerations.9. The long and the short of it is that whatever solution is adopted therewill be criticism. If the Service goes back to local Government it will be saidthat the Government is permitting the breaking-up of a fine national Servicebecause it is afraid of the local authorities; if it is decided to retain the national fire Service, the local authorities will say that the Government has gone backon its pledge.10. In the interests of efficiency there is much to be said for retaining aSer vice which is a going concern, but on the other side there is the specific under-taking given in 1941. The local authorities will, no doubt, argue that underpeace-time conditions the efficiency of the Fire Service can be adequately securedunder a system of local control provided appropriate standards are laid down
centrally and an adequate system of inspection is introduced. They will claim that the case for nationalisation is no stronger in relation to the Fire Servicesthan it is in relation to many other services which it is the Governments intentionto leave in local authority hands.11. As to the attitude of the local authorities themselves it is difficult tobe certain at this stage. It is known already that the Association of municipal corporations will press not necessarily with unanamity or enthusiasm for a return to the 1938 Act position, while the Convention of Royal Burghs have askedfor an undertakiii&quot;- that briq;ades will be restored to local authorities on definedconditions, such conditions not to preclude the establishment of districts of extentsuitable for administrative purposes. There is also indirect evidence that agood many members of local councils have recognised that large units of controlhave important advantages for peace-time operations no less than for war purposes, but it is by no means clear that these views will find expression in thediscussions with the official representatives of the local authority Associations or those who speak on their behalf in Parliament.Recommendation.12. It seems to us important to ascertain, in the first instance, what thecurrent reactions of the local authorities to the problem are, and for this purpose,we would propose to open up discussions with the local authority Associationsat an early date. The object of the discussions should be primarily exploratory;but they should, we suggest, proceed on the Government side on the followingfooting : (a) - that the public interest requires that the progress made possible bynationalisation of the Fire Services should not be lost, and that meansmust be found to secure that all the main advantages are continuedafter the war;(&amp;) that return to the 1,668 fire authorities of the Fire Brigades Act wouldnot satisfy this condition, or be compatible with modern technicalrequirements and would thus not be an acceptable solution;(c) that retention of the National Fire Service may be considered, if it shouldbe found that this solution is acceptable to important sections ofpublic and Parliamentary opinion; and(cl) that, if local authority control is reintroduced in any force, it should beon the basis that : (i) the National Fire Service must remain in being until reorganisa-tion on a peace-time footing has been completed; and(ii) central supervision and standards of efficiency will need to bemaintained with such measure of inspection as may be necessary.13. The question whether, if the Fire Service returns to local authoritycontrol, subject to central supervision and standards of efficiency, an exchequer grant will be payable, as in the case of the police, is sure to be raised in thecourse of our exploratory talks. We think that such a grant would be strongly pressed and might have to be considered; but we do not propose that any promise of Exchequer assistance should be held out in the course of the discussions nowin prospect.H M.T.
