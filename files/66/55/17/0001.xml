It is issued for the personal use of -^Q-a-^-TOP SECRET Copy No.W.P. (44) 517.l^th September, 1944.WAR CABINET.MUNITIONS PRODUCTION : EFFECTS OF ASSUMPTION THAT THEGERMAN WAR ENDS BY 31st DECEMBER, 1944.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.1. The War Cabinet has agreed (W.M. (44) 116th Conclusions, Minute 8)that &quot; for the purpose of estimating man-power requirements in the second half of1944, it should now be assumed that the war against Germany will not continuebeyond the 31st December, 1944.&quot;2. I have discussed the questions involved with the Joint War production staff on the footing that this decision must be translated into definite action in theform of cancellation of contracts or the reduction of previously proposed orders.3. I do not think it would be right to start the machine into motion on aseries of decisions which within a very short time wrould be irrevocable without making very clear to my colleagues the full implications of such action.4. Firstly, as to procedure, the Supply Departments, on the basis of theassumption that the war ends this year, wyould proceed to adjust their programmes,being guided by the following considerations : (i) CxLrrent Production, They would make an immediate start with theprocess o f reducing output to the levels dictated by the requirements of stage II. It would not be immediately possible to take full account ofthe decisions that may be made at Quebec. It is, therefore, proposedto reduce programmes in two stages. The first stage would bring them down to the levels required to meet the needs of the japanese war as now estimated, on the basis of the present strategy and on thebasis of ^two-year war. The second, and any further stages, wouldtake account of the strategic decisions made at the Quebec Conferenceand any reduction in the assumed length of the Japanese war. the scales of output of particular weapons and stores that we shall need inthis country during Stage II will depend, of course, on the degree ofassistance that may be promised to us from the United States and canada. The cuts that will be made in the first stage of programmeadjustments will be based, in the case of the Ministry of Supply, onthe assumption of proportionate aid, and in the case of the Ministryof Aircraft Production, on the assumption that existing provisionalassignments are fulfilled. When, at the second stage, we know the fuliresults of the discussions at Quebec, and of subsequent negotiations bythe responsible Departments, we shall be able to eliminate this element of insurance also. It is thought that the first stage cuts will in factrelease as much labour as can quickly be absorbed into normalproduction for export or civilian use. The speed of release will tosome extent be related to the possible rate of absorption. Close contactin this respect is being maintained with the Board of Trade and theMinistry of Labour.[28216]
(ii) New Projects, Expansion Schemes and Type Changes. One or other ofthe following conditions must be satisfied in order to justify continuedproduction (a) that it will make an effective contribution to the German war;(b) that it is needed for Stage II;(c) that it represents a minimum provision beyond the researchstage desirable on long-term strategic grounds.5. Secondly, as to the effects of this procedure, I attach as an appendix someillustrations of what it will mean in practice. I think my colleagues must realise that these decisions once made are for all practical purposes irrevocable. That isto say, the flow of special material once interrupted could not be restarted intime to prevent serious shortages. Capacity released from hundreds of firmsnow making all kinds of components could not readily be put back again to thesewar uses; and the labour once dispersed could not easily or quickly be re-assembled. If, therefore, this action is now taken and the war with Germanycontinues beyond the 31st December. 1944. we shall have to wage it with the stocks remaining at that date phis the reduced flow of new munitions nowplanned.6. The full consequences to our man-power position of this new assumptioncannot yet be stated accurately. The Admiralty is already engaged almostentirely on production for Stage II. and no appreciable saving is expected. Inthe ease of the Ministry of Aircraft Production, there is expected to be anadditional saving, beyond that now planned in accordance with W.M. (44)100th Conclusiozrs, Minute 4. to fulfil the existing man-power allocations,of about&apos; 100,000 in the remaining months of 1944. and a further 400,000(300.000 of them in the first quarter) during the first half of 1945. The Ministryof Supply is likely to be able to release some 50,000 beyond the 170.000 required by its man-power allocation during the remaining months of 1944 or early 1945; the advancement of the assumed end of the war will imply that a large part of theremainder of the reduction of between 400.000 and 500,000 to bring the Ministryof Supply clown to the target of 740.000 required by twelve months after the endof the German war will occur during the first half of 1945.7. If the War Cabinet decide that we must now take this kind of actionon the assumption that the Avar will be over by the end of this year, there is another consequence for Avhich are should be prepared. The Supply departments will be drastically curtailing during the next few AAreeks their orders for rawmaterials and semi-finished products. Manufacturers in their turn will bereducing their orders to sub-contractors. It is therefore an essential corollarythat orders for civilian purposes should be placed on the capacity thus set free,so as to enable the firms invoh&apos;ed to retain their labour on a scale which willalloAv them to meet immediate post-Avar requirements. This scale must of necessity be a matter for discussion betAveen the departments concerned.O. L.Ministry of Production, Great George Street, S.W. 1,14^ September, 1944.&quot;
APPENDIX.I.  War Office and Ministry of Supply.(a) A armoured Fighting Vehicles.(i) Tanks.-The 1945 planned rates are now 100 Churchills a month and250 of the Cromwell group.   The new planning levels would be 70 and100 a month respectively,(ii) Carriers. There would be a cut of about two-thirds in planned UnitedKingdom production,(iii) Scout Cars. Production would be reduced from 312 per month to 60.(b) Ammunition.(i) 25-pdr. The planned build-up would be reduced from 1,750,000 to1,000,000 per month.   Part of the reduction would be in Canada,(ii) Other. There will be some restriction of 4-5-inch, but no appreciablechange in 5 - 5-inch or in mortar bombs.  There is likely to be a furthercut on 40-mm. ammunition, output of which has recently been heavilyreduced.(c) Wheeled Vehicles. On the basis of a two-year Japanese war, and on present indications of the probable aid from United States, there is not likelyto be any substantial reduction in the total requirements for wheeled vehicles.(d) Signal and Communication Stores. There is not likely to any greatreduction of total output but capacity will be increasingly transferred to thespecial requirements for Far Eastern conditions.(e) Small A rms. There would be heavy cuts in output of Bren guns andstandard rifles. New types required for Japanese war would absorb a largerpart of the capacity than at present.(f) Bridging Material. No estimate has yet been made of the reduction of output of bridging material^ but the cut is expected to be considerable.II. Air Ministry and Ministry of Aircraft Production.(g) Heavy Bombers. As at present planned, production of heavy bomberswould rise from the current output of 468 to 512 in March 1945, and 549 in June1945; a decision to change immediately on to the programme for Stage II would imply a reduction to 323 in March and 255 in June.(h) R.A.F. Fighters (other than Jet-Propelled). As at present planned,production of fighters would rise from the current output of 565 to 669 in March1945, and 714 in June 1945; immediate change on to the Stage II programme would imply a reduction to 514 in March 1945, and 414 in June 1945, falling to340 by December 1945. The relative^ high planned output in the first half of1945 is dictated by the necessity to make the newest types available to rearmsquadrons before they are deployed against the Japanese.(i) Heavy Transports. The present programme provides for only 54 trans-ports in March 1945, and 48 in June 1945; the Stage II programme requires amuch larger production and the j)lanned cuts on heavy bombers will make this possible; the Stage II programme provides a combined production of about 130 amonth of heavy transports to be reached by March 1945. About half of these willbe converted heavy bombers.(j) Engines and Components. Immediate cuts would need to be made onengines, components and equipment to accord with the main airframe pro-gramme.   These cuts, once made, would be irrevocable.III.-A dmiralty.(k) Almost all Admiralty production is already directed to Stage II, and noimportant consequences would arise either from the application of the assumptionthat the German war ends in 1944 or from its possible falsification. There maybe some further savings when the Pacific strategy is determined, but it is theview of the Admiralty that these are not likely to be large.
