Printedthe War Cabinet.   June 1943.135CONFIDENTIAL.Copy No*W.P. (43) 286.29th June, 1943.WAR CABINET.WARNING TO NEUTRALS NOT TO GRANT ASYLUM TO ENEMYLEADERS AND WAR CRIMINALS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AMONG the provisional conclusions reached by the Ministerial Committeeappointed by the War Cabinet a year ago to study the question of the treatmentof war criminals was the recommendation that all possible steps should be takento prevent war criminals from obtaining asylum in neutral countries. Most ofthe Allied Governments whom I have consulted in the matter have made it clearthat they attach importance to such steps being taken in good time. There hasalso been some public interest in the subject and a number of questions have beenasked in Parliament.2. I had hitherto intended that this question should be considered by a united Nations technical committee., which it is hoped to set up in connexionwith the proposed United Nations Commission for the investigation of war crimes.It has, however, still not been possible to establish the Commission, since, despiterepeated reminders, I have not yet been able to obtain from any of our majorAllies final replies to the proposals which I made to them last March.3. A stage of the war has now been reached when we can no longer postponeconsideration of the problem of asylum. The danger that enemy leaders and war criminals, especially Italians, may try to escape to neutral countries is becomingan immediate issue. I have accordingly had the question studied afresh and wishto recommend to my colleagues as a matter of urgency that a declaration should beissued by the Governments of the United Nations solemnly warning neutral governments not to afford asylum to enemy leaders and war criminals. We should give them this warning in good time, since it will be easier to prevent themgranting asylum than to attempt to persuade them to give up the criminals once they have been allowed to enter neutral territory. A public warning will be amore suitable procedure at this stage of the war than diplomatic representations,which might only invite awkward replies. We must, however, word our warningcautiously as we do not wish to give any of the neutrals an excuse to refuse entry to Allied nationals now escaping from occupied Europe.4. I accordingly circulate, for the approval of my colleagues, the draft of adeclaration which has been prepared in consultation with the Lord chancellor and the Attorney-General.5. In order to give the declaration the fullest authority, all the united nations Governments, including, of course, the Dominions Governments, should,I think, be invited to participate in it. In instructing His Majesty&apos;s Representa-tives to invite the participation of the Governments to which they are accredited, Iwould propose to suggest a definite time-limit say, of a fortnight before publication, to prevent similar delays to those which have taken place in connexionwith the proposed United Nations Commission.6. I should be grateful for the authority of the War Cabinet to proceed onthe above lines.A. E.Foreign Office, 29th June, 1943.12087   [25662]
ANNEX.Revised Draft Declaration.The Governments of1. Conscious of the responsibility which rests upon them for restoring,through the victory of the United Nations, the rule of justice throughoutthe world;2. Believing that the due punishment of war crimes and offences is anessential step to that end;3. Recalling the grievous suffering caused to great numbers of innocentpeople by reason of the present war and by the crimes against law and humanitycommitted during the course of it by the leaders of the enemy nations, theirsubordinates and also by their accomplices in other countries;4. Being resolved that persons responsible for causing that suffering shallnot escape retribution; and believing that no neutral country would wish to afford them assistance in so doing;5. Reaffirm their determination to seek out those concerned wherever theymay be found;. 6. Considering that, after the victory of the United Nations, neutral countries also will have their contribution to make towards the restoration of the rule of justice throughout the world, and are no less concerned than the partiesto the present Declaration to secure that war criminals should not escape justice and that war crimes should be punished;7. , Call upon all neutral countries to refuse asylum to persons fleeing fromthe consequences of their crimes or whose object, or probable object, in seekingasylum is to avoid falling into the hands of the United Nations, or who seek itin consequence or in anticipation of the defeat of their country or of its occupation by the forces of the United Nations:8. And declare that they will regard any shelter, assistance or protection given to such persons as a violation of the principles for which they are fighting and as an act unfriendly to themselves. -
