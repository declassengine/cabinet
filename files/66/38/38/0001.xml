THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT &apos;Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.Copy tto.WAR CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production.1. I think we shall be missing the essential point about the presentsituation in Palestine unless we treat it as part of the wider problem of World.Jewry. The tension and latent unrest in Palestine, and the unbalanced emotionalattitude of American (and to a less extent British) Zionists towards the Palestinesituation are symptoms of the hysteria which, for reasons which are under-standable, has overcome the Jewish community in the free world. With thetragedy of racial extermination running its course before their eyes in Europeit is not surprising that increasing numbers of Jews elsewhere should have cometo feel with passionate intensity that the creation of a Jewish State in palestine is vital for their survival as a community. So long as this hysterical mood persiststhe dangers of grave embarrassment for the United Nations and final calamityfor the Jews need no emphasis. I am convinced that we must begin byendeavouring to remove it.2. I suggest, therefore, that the British and American Governments (or,possibly, the United Nations in concert) should make a solemn declaration to theJews along these lines :  (i) that the relief and honourable rehabilitation of the Jews in their formerhomes in Europe was a definite war aim;(ii) - that the principle of full and equal citizenship rights for Jews wouldbe insisted upon in all territories freed from Nazi or Fascist tyranny;(iii) that there was no departure from the policy of fostering a JewishNational Home in Palestine;(iv) that, meanwhile, every effort would be made, subject to the over-ridingneeds of war, to provide temporary or permanent homes for jewish refugees from Axis oppression. (The precise limits, of what we considered possible in Palestine, Eritrea or elsewhere should be made known to Jewish leaders in confidence.)3. This declaration should, I think, be accompanied by an invitation toabout 15-20 leading Jews, representative of the main tendencies in Jewishthought from extreme Zionism to the opposite extreme, to attend a Conference,held under United Nations auspices in London, to consider the position of theJews in the post-war world. The purpose of this Conference would be toconsider the problem in its broadest terms. The Jewish National Home wouldbe only one item on the agenda and would, I believe, fall into better perspectivein the course of the deliberations. I feel sure that the longer the Conferencewent on the less interest it would have in irreconcilable Zionism, which, undercalmer and more rational consideration, will&apos; be seen to offer very limitedattractions for the Jews compared with what post-Nazi Europe may have tooffer for their depleted numbers. Indeed, if conditions 2 (i) and (ii) above were applied, then the economic and social prospects of the Jews in Europe wouldcompare so favourably with their prospects in an overcrowded Palestine, thatthere well might be a net outward balance of migration from that country.4. Such steps as these would, I believe, have a marked effect on the presentmood of the Jews. It would give them new and wider hope for the future and strengthen the hands of their moderates. It would, also, enable us to postponewith safety any revision of the 1939 White Paper policy for the time being, except,[25666] &apos;SECRET.W.P. (43) 288.1st July, 1943. &apos;
I suggest, to extend the period during which Jewish immigration might be permitted, to allow of the absorption of the White Paper number of 75,000 (which,I understand, has still far from been reached). Objection by the Arabs to sucha minor modification of the White Paper policy would, I think, be unreasonablein view of the unexpectedly low level of Jewish immigration owing to the incidence of the war. We and the Americans should assure the Arabs that we haveno intention of permitting or surrendering to forceful changes of any kind inthe administration of Palestine; and that we would regard the forcible establish-ment of a Jewish State as contrary to the principles upon which the peace settlement must be based.5. So far as long-term policy in Palestine is concerned, I think it is clearthat there is little hope of obtaining Arab acquiescence in the establishmenteither of a Jewish State or of a State threatened, however remotely,, with Jewishdomination. Our commitments are such that we must; therefore, persist in ourattempt to establish a bi-national State (as we succeeded in establishing inCanada). If we can. do it within a wider federal grouping including Syria,Lebanon and Transjordan so much the better.6. One of the chief difficulties in the way of establishing a healthybi-national State in Palestine is the wide gap between the economic, social and educational standards of the Arabs and Jews respectively. It is essential thatwe should seek by a progressive economic and social policy to raise the standardof living of the Arabs in Palestine to something approaching the standard whichhas been reached (thanks largely to Zionist capital) by the Jews. . Such a policy would probably be best carried out on a regional basis as part of the development,along lines suggested by the Minister of State, of the work of the Middle EastSupply Centre.R.
