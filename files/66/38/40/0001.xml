Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (43) 290.2nd July, 1943.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED PUBLICATION BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTOF RECORDS OF THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE.I circulate to my colleagues herewith a memorandum prepared in the WarCabinet Offices on the above subject. The memorandum describes the corres-pondence which has recently passed between the Foreign Office and. the UnitedStates Embassy and sets out the advantages and disadvantages of the publicationof these documents from the British point of view.2. It appears that the State Department have decided to publish, regardless of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and any further attempt to dissuadethe United States Government may therefore be unsuccessful. Nevertheless, I amimpressed by the force of the. arguments against the publication of these confi-dential records, set out in paragraph 7 of the War Cabinet Offices memorandum.3. From the practical point of view it is, I think, beyond doubt that thepublication of the minutes of the Council of Four in particular would have acramping effect on any similar confidential discussions which it maybe necessary tohold after the present war. Statesmen, especially the representatives of the smalleroccupied countries of Europe, could scarcely be expected to speak freely or to advance or discuss in private possible concessions on matters of vital concern to public opinion in their own countries, if they had any fear that their offerswould be published in official print within their lifetime. Alternatively theymight refuse to allow any record to be kept, with consequent inconvenience duringthe period of the conference and serious risk of misunderstanding afterwards. ;4. The further point made in paragraph 7 (iii) of the attached memo-randum, that the publication of these records of discussions after the last war may provide hostile propagandists with welcome material, will also assumeexceptional importance at the time of the next peace conference.5. To these practical considerations there might be added an argumentof principle. From the point of view of publication a distinction may be drawn between diplomatic correspondence, which is concerned with the execution ofpolicy, and minutes and memoranda, which relate to its formulation. The formerconsists of documents drafted with.care and with an eye to the future record;the latter tend to be drawn up hastily with a more immediate purpose and may prove misleading when read many years after by persons not intimately concernedin the discussions they record. It is therefore arguable - that the latter class ofdocument, to which the records of the Paris Peace Conference and in particular the minutes of the Council of Four may be said to belong, is out of place in acollection, like the State Department&apos;s series, which is primarily devoted to theformer. . *6. For the above reasons I recommend that I should be authorised, inconsultation with the War Cabinet Offices, to&apos;make a further effort to dissuadethe United States Government from proceeding with their proposal to publish the records of the Paris Peace Conference, including the minutes of the Councilof Four, but should be given discretion to concur in this proposal, if the UnitedMemorandum by ti-ie Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.12091   [256721b
States Government absolutely insist upon it. In the latter event I&apos;would, how-even, recommend prior consultation with Mr. Lloyd George, as suggested inparagraph 8 (&amp;)&apos; of the War Cabinet Offices memorandum. As regards the point raised in paragraph 8 (c) of that memorandum, I think we should agree to supplement the United States records, if we are reluctantly compelled to agreeto the publication at all.A. E.Foreign Office, 2nd July, 1943.ANNEXRecords of the Paris Peace Conference.Proposed Publication by United States Government.IT has come to notice that the State Department, as part of a series of official documents dealing with the foreign relations of the United States, are proposing to publish the complete records of the Paris Peace Conference, 1919. Theserecords include the Minutes of the Meetings of the Council of Four, which are the crucial documents.2.. This Council of Four sat from the end of March to the end of June 1919.At the outset the records were meagre as no Secretary was present; but fromthe end of April, Sir Maurice (now Lord) Hankey kept Minutes as Secretary,and full records are available. The proceedings fill three foolscap volumes,consisting of about 1,200 pages.3.&quot; The Council of Four discussed the question of disclosure of theirproceedings on the 28th June, 1919 (a copy of the discussion on this point is annexed). It will be seen that President Wilson was strongly of opinion that these documents should be treated as a record of purely private conversations; and,in summing up the discussion, he said that there should be a clear and. distinctunderstanding that no one should in any circumstances make public the proces-verbal of the proceedings. On the other hand, Mr. Lloyd George and otherspointed out that it might not be possible to avoid the publication of extracts fromthese records for the purpose of proving particular facts, e.g:., in parlimentary debates.4. In 1941 a request was received from the United States Embassy for agreement to publish the complete records of the Versailles Peace Conference.The decision taken was to inform the United States Government that we were notin favour of publication at that date. This decision, it was understood, wasinfluenced by the considerations that-(a) If these documents were published officially they would cause a stir andmight be made use of by those unfriendly to our cause.(b) Further, it was understood that publication of parts of the proceedingswould be detrimental to our Allies the Poles, the Czechs and theYugo-Slavs.5. It has recently come to our notice that the&apos; United States Governmentwere proposing to proceed with the publication of these records without seeking the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government, or of any of the Governments concerned,before proceeding with publication. On the matter being brought to their notice,they have now written to say that they would &quot; appreciate having any commentsor suggestions which the Foreign Office may wish to make before the editing ofthe documents is completed &quot; (probably on the 15th July next). They have also asked whether we can supply them with copies of certain Minutes of the meetings which are missing from their collection.6; The main arguments in favour of agreeing to publication of these documents now are as follows : (i) Almost all President Wilson&apos;s Peace Conference papers (includingMinutes of the Council of Four) have already been published in the.United States, without authority, by Mr. Ray Stannard Baker.
(ii) Portions of the Minutes of these Meetings have already been published by Mr. Lloyd George and others in books dealing with the PeaceConference.(iii) The copies of these records which were in the possession of the Italian,and possibly also the French, Government are now available to theenemy, who can make what use of these documents they wish.7.   The main arguments against publication would seem to be as follows : (i) The Minutes of the Council of Four are obviously, so to speak, roughworkings kept for the convenience of the Statesmen concerned, andnot intended for publication. While, no doubt, everything becomespublishable after a long enough interval, there seems to be a certaininherent impropriety in official publication by one of the Governmentsconcerned, during the.lifetime of some of the participants.(ii) A more practical consideration is whether publication now -(a) will make it more difficult for the essential business of the PeaceConference after this war to be transacted by a Council ofThree or Four; or(&amp;) would make the Statesmen on such a Council reluctant to speakfreely or alternatively unwilling to have a record kept, oftheir proceedings&apos; a course which might entail some adminis-trative inconvenience.(iii) Although these Minutes are too voluminous to be read by the general public, they will provide some bonnes-bouches for hostile commentatorsand propagandists.If Ministers decide in favour of publication : A clear understanding should it is submitted be obtained from theUnited States Government that confidential documents of highpolitical importance must not be published by one government without the consent of other Governments who were parties to thoseconversations. In the present case, consultation with the French andItalian Governments does not arise; but there is no excuse for theUnited States Government not obtaining the consent of the Govern-ment of this country before deciding on publication.Mr. Lloyd George should be given an opportunity of expressing his views before a final decision is reached and conveyed to the United StatesGovernment.A decision is required whether we should supplement the United Statesrecords by letting them have the Minutes of which they have no copies..27th May, 1943.EXTRACT FROM THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE COUNCIL OF four of THE 28th JUNE, 1919.(Secret.)SIR MAURICE HANKEY said that he had been asked by various officials to supply copies of the Notes of the Meetings of the Council of the principal allied and Associated Powers, and he asked for instructions.M. CLEMENCE AU said that in his view they ought not to be communicatedto anyone, and that there should be a general agreement to this effect.M. SONNINO pointed out that the question would arise immediately inconnection with the Italian Delegation as to whether those records should be handed by one Government to their successors in office. In his view this was indis-pensable. He could not vouch for it that M. Orlando had not already given themto M. Tittoni. It would be very difficult for the new Government to conduct thebusiness if it did not know, what had been decided by its predecessors in theCouncil.PRESIDENT WILSON expressed a strong view that these documents oughtto be treated as purely private conversations.   He recalled that it was on hisinitiative that the meetings&apos;.of this small group had been held.   He had invited[25672] . II
his colleagues to meet him for the purpose of private conversations at his ownhouse. For a long time no notes had been kept at all. Later, however, it had been realised that this was not a very convenient procedure and Secretaries had been admitted. If, however, he had thought that these Notes were to be passed onto Government Departments, he would have insisted on adhering to the system under which no secretaries were present. All the decisions had been communi-cated to the officials who had to carry them out, but he had the strongest objectionsto the communication of the accounts given in the Notes of the private conversa-tions. All present had spoken their minds with great freedom. Contradictionscould, no doubt, be found in the Notes to what had been said at different times and under different circumstances. It was even conceivable that political opponents who came into possession of these documents might misuse them. he did not think that properly speaking the Council could be described as an officialbody. The only official body was the Conference of Peace. The present group had rightly, as he thought, taken upon itself to formulate the decisions for thePeace Conference, but their conversations ought not to be regarded as official.He saw no objection to the communication of the notes to individuals in the personal confidence of members of the Council, for example, he had instructedSir Maurice Hankey to communicate a complete set of the documents toMr. Lansing, who was a Minister appointed by himself and in his entireconfidence.M. CLEMENCEAU said that if he had to resign Office he would find ita great embarrassment not to hand over these documents to his successor in Office.He did not think that they could be regarded as private property.M. SONNINO said that perhaps these need not be regarded as official reportssince they had not been carefully checked and corrected. Nevertheless, theycontained important statements which, in some cases, were not recorded as conclusions. He quoted one case, for example, where M. Orlando had made animportant statement of which the Council had taken formal note, and this, he believed, was merely recorded in the proces-verb&apos;al. It might be very important for M. Orlando&apos;s successor in office to have a copy of this.M. CLEMENCEAU recalled a similar case where he had insisted on theimportance of interpreting certain provisions in the resolutions regardingmandates, so as to enable France to use African soldiers for the defence of her territory, and Mr. Lloyd George had suggested that it would be sufficient to mention it in the proces-verbcd.PRESIDENT WILSON said that certainly such statements should beregarded as official, but, nevertheless, he thought the actual conversations which led up to the conclusions reached should be regarded as private.^ Mr. LLOYD GEORGE suggested that the precedents ought to be looked up.For example, he would like to know whether the proces-verbaux of all conversa-tions which took place in the Treaty of Berlin had been published.PRESIDENT WILSON said that probably at the Congress of Berlin therehad been recorded formal Conferences and informal conversations which werenot recorded.Mr. LLOYD GEORGE said- that he had never had time to look at the notesat all.eM. CLEMENCEAU said that he also had never had time. He recalled,however, that Sir Maurice Hankey had several times been called upon to refer to what had occurred at the Council, for example, an important statement byMarshal Foch had been referred to at a recent meeting.PRESIDENT WILSON said that when such references had been made hehad been much struck with the accuracy of the record. He thought that everyaction taken and every conclusion reached should be recorded as official and shouldbe available in the appropriate offices,- but not the conversations.M. SONNINO said that they certainly should not be publishable or evenpresentable to Parliament, but he thought that the successors of the Governmentin office, if challenged, must be in a position to know what had. happened.PRESIDENT WILSON laid emphasis on the difference between handing onto a successor or to a set of Government officials, and to a confidential and trustedcolleague. &apos;
M. SONNINO thought it would be very hard on a new Government not tohave these documents.PRESIDENT WILSON said he realised that the United States workedunder a different Parliamentary system. There, no one had the right to claimdocuments of this kind. One adverse comment that might be made was that noSecretary had been present representing the United States of America. his reply would be that he had had complete confidence in the Secretaries who hadbeen present, but the criticism might be made. The net result seemed to be that each Government must take the course traditional in its own country with the clear and distinct understanding that no one should, under any circumstances,make the proces-verbal public.Mr. LLOYD GEORGE said that, if an attack were made on the politicalheads, he might feel bound, in particular cases, to refer to these notes. He gavefair warning that he might have to do this unless someone protested now.M. CLEMENCEAU said it would not be possible to refuse extracts from theproces-verbal to prove particular facts.
