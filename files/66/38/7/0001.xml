Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.SECRET. ; / Copy No.W.P. (43) 257.22nd June, 1943.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR CIVIL AVIATION.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues some provisional views on civil aviation.The difficulty of getting agreement among the Dominions at this stage shouldnot prevent the formulation of British policy after consultation with them. Atthe same time it is important and urgent to ascertain the views and wishes ofthe United States. Everything will be much easier if. an informal understandingis reached with them. It would be well in the first instance to find out what thePresident thinks about it all, and after we have somewhat shaped our views Ishall be ready to address him personally.W. S. C.10. Downing Street, S.W. 1,22nd June, 1943.

SECEET.CIVIL AVIATION.1. The background of present discussions about Post-War Civil Aviationis dominated by memories of pre-war chaos and fears of the intentions of certainAmerican interests. Before the war practically every country ran highlysubsidised and uneconomic air lines in cut-throat competition with its neigh-bours; small Powers levied blackmail on lines passing over their territories;military prohibitions on numerous frontiers entailed long detours. Since the warUnited States interests have, in the course of coming to our aid, established themselves on a number of routes; and their aircraft industry is in a better position than ours to step into civil aviation the moment war ends.2. Excessive hopes are, I fear, founded upon the widespread belief that afterthe war we shall have to build civil aircraft in great numbers, and.that here is afield in which the means of avoiding unemployment may be found. In fact,however, there is no industry which will undergo a more intense and severe contrac-tion than the aircraft industry, including all branches of its splendid, skilledpersonnel. We must not lose our sense of proportion in presence of the vastscale of the war-effort in the air, or imagine that anything like this prodigy ofwartime flying can be maintained by mankind in the present age. No doubt asrecovery from war devastation sets in, many more people will travel by air; butthis will occupy hardly a tithe of the aircraft now carrying bombs to Germany.Civil aircraft last so long, perhaps four &quot;years, they are exposed to so few risks and have such a quick turn-round, that a very large traffic can be supported by avery small annual output.3. Taking our own country as an example, less than a million and a halfpassengers left this island for Europe by sea and air in a good pre-war year.If all of these were carried by air, they would not require, I. am informed, more,than about 150 aircraft in running order with, say, an additional 100 for holidayperiods. The number of travellers from here to other Continents was under150,000. Having regard to the longer turn-round, these could be carried in, say,another 150 planes. Hence, even if all passengers leaving these shores went by air, a fleet of 1,000 civil aircraft would be more than ample to carry them.Considerably less than 40 new aircraft built a month would suffice to maintain this fleet as compared with the 400 heavy bombers a month we shall soon be making. These figures are merely illustrations. It will probably be many years before the development of mail, freight and passenger traffic will supersede this general picture.4. Our two earliest studies .of post-war civil aviation have recommendedcomplete internationalisation. If by this is meant a kind of Volapuk Esperantocosmopolitan organisation managed and, staffed by committees of all peoples great and small, with pilots of every country from Peru to China (especially China),flying every kind of machine in every direction, many people will feel that thisis at present an unattainable ideal. It is unnecessary, however, now to considerthe argument for and against this and kindred proposals, since they are clearlyunacceptable to the United States, the Dominions and probably Russia. Wemust agree upon some less high-spirited line of approach to guide us in the forth-coming international discussions.5. After the war some world organisation, or some grouping of ContinentalCouncils, will be set up for maintaining peace. Air power resulting from civilaviation will necessarily be subject to the control of this body or bodies. Wemust be careful not to stereotype development, and there is much to be said for theprinciple of &quot; a fair field and no favour,&quot; Any disputes that arise should bereferred for adjustment to bodies set up under the world organisation.6.   Within this framework the three main facets of our policy seem to be : 1. For strategic and political reasons, we must develop under our controllarge, efficient air lines binding the British Commonwealth and empire together. Owing to the long hauls, low payloads, and the needfor services which cannot be justified on purely commercial grounds,these will be costly.[25607a]
2. We should, of course, expand internal air lines so far as* practicable.This expansion is unlikely to be large because distances in^ theUnited Kingdom are so short that the time taken to reach the airfieldsfrom the city centres will make it hard for the air lines to compete with our excellent railway and motor services, at any rate untilhelicopter feeding services or some equivtilent are developed.3. The best size for an air transport system is an area containing large towns 200 or 300 miles apart, like the United States of&apos;America, orthe U.S.S.R., or Europe, We should make a strong British effort toexcel in the profitable European traffic.7. The following fundamental topics will have to form part of a general convention : 1. Everyone agrees that some &quot;minimum of international regulation isnecessary concerning navigation devices, safety standards, meteoro-logical services, customs, quarantine. &amp;c. Methods of putting thisinto effect and financing it will have to be agreed.2. It is reasonably assumed (on the analogy of roads, lighthouses, &amp;c.) that each Government will provide airfields, ground facilities, meteoro-logical services, &amp;c, in its own territory. (Assistance might have to begiven to small countries like Iraq.) Methods of fixing landingcharges, &amp;c, will have to be agreed.3. We have also to find a fair via media between the principle of a nation&apos;ssovereignty over its own air (which strictly applied would hamperdevelopment) and the doctrine of the Freedom of the Air, whichunbridled would be rejected.8. This third topic is likely to be the most difficult. The main stagesinvolved are : (i) The right of innocent passage,(ii). The right to land for non-traffic purposes.(iii) The right to land passengers and freight embarked in the aircraffsown country of origin.(iv) The right to embark passengers, &amp;c, destined for the aircrafts own country of origin.(v) The right to embark and set down passengers, &amp;c, at two intermediatepoints (whether in the same country or not) en route.(vi) The right of nationals of any country to run an air service between oneforeign country and another.(vii) The right of nationals of any country to run air services inside other foreign countries.Points (i), (ii) and (iii) are, I observe, commended in the Memorandum bythe Minister without Portfolio (W.P. (43) 251). Points (iv), (v) and (vi) are more, controversial; but, subject to certain -safeguards about subsidies to be mentioned presently, we should press for them if our basic policy is to be &quot; a fairfield and no favour.&quot; Whether these safeguards would also justify us in adoptingpoint (vii) should be carefully considered.9. A convention containing these points alone would not prevent the evils and shortcomings of pre-war days, and we should perhaps be inadequatelyprotected against Pan-American infiltration in the immediate post-war period.These difficulties could, however, be largely met if the-scope of the body or bodiesworking under the World Council or under Continental Councils dealing withaviation comprised the ascertainment and regulation of any subsidies paid.Admittedly this is a difficult task, but it should not be beyond the wit of man todeal with it. In America, I understand Congress already insists upon thepublication of detailed accounts as a condition of giving subsidies.10. If we could discover what subsidies were being received, the difficulties about accepting points (iv), (v) and (vi), and possibly (vii&apos;), could be met by a con-dition that no subsidised airline or at any rate no line subsidised beyond an agreed general minimum could of right take up or set down passengers or freightin another country&apos;s territory. Any government would be free to subsidise its own internal lines as much as it wished. Such an arrangement would enable us to sub-sidise our Commonwealth and Imperial Air Lines, as we shall have to do, but would:Save us from unfair competition in running services between various sovereignEuropean countries.    Possibly special intra-Empire arrangements might be
6 uwanted to safeguard air lines inside ,certain Dominions against Britishcompetition.We should, of course, closely investigate whether and to what extentMr. Berle&apos;s alternative suggestion about an agreement on rates might meet theends we have in view.11. It might be convenient to form some, ostensibly, internationalcorporation to run all the Air Services in Western Europe. With Germany andItaly forbidden ownership of aircraft, and the remaining countries newlyrescued from them, and dependent on us for all sorts of help, it should not beimpossible for us to play a leading part in this body. Whether the americans would agree to this territory having (for purposes of the above-mentioned subsidyprivilege) the status of a national unit will have to be explored. Perhaps wecould offer them an acceptable quid pro quo in South America.Questions not conflicting with the general agreements could be dealt with bybilateral negotiations.12. These notes concern themselves only with the international aspects ofcivil aviation. Many arguable domestic issues will, arise in applying these principles. Should there be one corporation controlling all British air lines ora number of rival companies, what should be the position of the shipping and railway lines; on what system should British subsidies, if any, be paid; what should be the degree of Government control: what Ministry should be responsibleand so forth ? Discussion of these points should not obstruct or delay the creationof the main international framework.
