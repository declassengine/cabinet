THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MBSTYJg GOVERNMENTW.P*(4-5) 28429th June, 1945FAR CABINETTHE. TWO-STAGE ENDING 0? THE WAR AND MOBILISATION,MILITARY AND CIVILMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service.     I have given careful thought to the issues raised in W*B* (43)241and the related memoranda which have &quot;been circulated to the &quot;War Cabinet.It is clear that, from now on, we shall need to give continuous attention to the many questions whioh. will arise in connection with civil and militarydemobilisation, only a few of which are dealt with in the memoranda before theCabinet.     We ought now, therefore, to settle(i) the interdepartmental machinery necessary for reviewing demobilisa-tion policy and supervising the operation of the demobilisation plan, and(ii) the executive machinery which will be required to implement the plan as a matter of day to day operation.2.     Valuable preparatory work has been done by the interdepartmental committee on the Machinery of Demobilisation, and their reports have given usa foundation on which to build.    But we are now moving out of the realm of planning into that of active discussion with industry and other interested bodies, ard it is necessary to consider the questions raised in paragraph 1in the light of the responsibility which will fall upon the Ministry of Labourand National Service for the execution of Governmental policy.     When we cometo demobilisation whether partial or complete, the machinery which has been built up to mobilise manpower, serve the requirements of the Forces and production and adjust the supply of labour to changes in the programme, mustbe ready to go into reverse.     The agencies of the Department which have been responsible for taking men and women away, from their civilian occupations.will become responsible for getting them back.3-     In preparing for this task and in carrying it through, detailed discussion and continuous association with both sides of industry will benecessary, in the same way as for the mobilisation of labour.     It hasalready been decided by the War Cabinet that, at the appropriate time, Ishould consult with the British Employers Confederation and Trades UnionCongress on the problems of reinstatement rights.     This is a&apos; matter whichmay involve further legislation or regulation and I have raised it on theLord Pr-esidenfs Committee (L.P* (43)143) as an issue requiring immediate decision.     I have been authorised by the Committee to prepare a scheme fordealing with re-instatement rights, in consultation with the Departmentsconcerned and with representatives of industry and the professions, but clearly this matter cannot be dealt with in isolation from the demobilisa-tion proposals as a whole.If, therefore, it is agreed that the time is now ripe for such action,I wquld propose to proceed as followsJ-(i) to present the. demobilisation proposals confidentially to theJoint Consultative Committee of the Trades Union Congress and british employers Confederation for detailed and thorough discussion, and towork out, in conjunction with the Committee, the arrangements necessaryto secure the collaboration of industry at every stage of civil andmilitary demobilisation, and
(ii) in the light of these discussions with the national organisations,to consult subsequently with the.various joint bodies responsible for industrial relations in&apos;their respective industries on such matters as:-(a) the re-employment of persons demobilised from, the Forces orreleased from war production in the first stages of demobilisation,(b) questions of special training or re-training to facilitatere-employment both of men and women,.(c) the possibility of holding positions. Open for those who willnot be demobilised till a later stage. : &apos;     .: .5.     As regards the question of interdepartmental machinery, I do notthink, in the light of the. foregoing considerations,&apos;&apos;that the right solution -is to reconstitute the official Committee on the -Machinery -of Demobilisation,dealing from time to time with, matters referred.to it./  &apos; The War Cabinet has  -already approved the proposal qf the Committee on Post-War-Internal Economic:Problems (paragraph 23. of Second.-Interim Report, R.Br (42-)35-) for establishing.,an&apos; Interdepartmental Committee,, on&apos; the lines !6&apos;f&quot;,&apos; the. war-time -Man &apos;Power.-Commit tee,to deal with demobilisation priorities.&apos; - This ; question is ihdissblubly linked with demobilisation policy and it is clearly hot desirable to have, more.thanone Interdepartmental. Committee dealing with policy., if,:confus&apos;ion and over- .lapping is to be avoided.    . I accordihgly suggest that the interdepartmental committee to be set up under the Chairmanship of the Joint Parliamentary       -   .$Secretary to.&apos;the&apos;..Aiixiistry of Labour should cover demobilisation, civil and  ,   f fmilitary, as a whole, including demob iii satich priorities..6.     I agres with the Minister without Portfolio that a - wantage, ending ofthe war will present special problems in civil demobilisation but none the lessit,will permit of&quot; a planned&apos; scaling clown of production which should materiallyease our diffieultirtS-     We have in war-time already had to deal with theproblem of the contraction of war production in certain branches and.,its&quot;.coincident expansion in&apos; others, and.it -is essential that, in-making&apos; adjustments of this kind now, we should, take account, so far as,,possible., of post-war needs.The change-over from war to civilian production&apos; and the consequent transfer oflabour--in each of the stages of demobilisation&apos;will, in effect, he a continua-tion on a much greater scale of what we are doing now and-our techniques mustbe adapted accordingly.&apos; . &quot;&quot;&apos; .-        ., --- -7.     I would, however, ask the. War Cabinet to lay it down- definitely that,in-planning the changes-Over,&apos; the predominant consideration should be that of keeping the risk of i;n;employment down to a minimum.,,-. .We must at &quot;all costsavoid a situation arising , in which,-as a result, of- a too :rigid concentrationpf. reduced war production on a limited number o.f firms,. there would be .unemployment in some &quot;arenas while in other areas munition workers&apos;&apos;were.being./retained at work against their will. - :: In scaling&quot; downproductiony&apos; therefore,.full-account must be taken of the. need for- maintaining..employment&apos; in th^ areas .-.,where-war production i$ ,tb; be closed do-wn^or curtailed until&apos;^te&apos;rnative&apos;.&quot;*..,employment is available in civilian production for the .workdi?B&apos; -who- we^tb &apos;b&apos;e&apos;.. displaced.     It is largely&quot; a quest ion of proper location and-correct timing,not different-in kind from &quot;that involved in war-time, adjustments of.war prpduc-tion.   - It is, however, essential,&apos;! that -lao &quot;time be&apos;lost, in Studying this&quot; subject ;and&apos;I therefore concur in the Minister&apos; without Portfolio1 s proposal for an earlyreport from the Chiefs of;Staff as.. .:to the requirements of personnel and materialsinvolved by a two-stage ending to the war. .    -8.     I am in entire agreement-with the desire&quot; of tlie Secretary of &quot;State:fov. War to accelerate^ i;he &quot;system for bringing home as many, as possible ofthe men who have served abroad for the longest.period.   . While I hope that it .may be possible to do this qn a-scale which will &quot;go -a considerable way tp .easing a difficult situation, I rather doubt whether it will discount ttie.claim -that service abroad &quot;should &quot;count-, for. iiiioi?e; than, sery^jpe. at-homS in&apos; thg-demob illsa-tipn scheme.     As -is pointed out by the Secretary of State for-Air in paragraph^of W.P*(43) 252, the continuance&apos; of.- compulsory&apos; military service would nave animportant effect in reassuring the lqng-service men as to the more even spreadingof the sacrifices and burden of war*     This question also I have already raised on the Lord Presidents Committee as one calling for early decision (L.P*(43)143)
The C   unit tee has decided that, while it is too early to take a decision as to the retention of compulsory military service as a permanent measure,we should proceed on the assumption that the National Service Acts willcontinue in operation at least until the peace treaty is signed.9c     Finally, as regards propaganda-, 7- imagine it will be generally agreed that, as soon as it is politic to do so, we should inform themembers of the Forces of the genera], nature of the demobilisationarrangements and of the action which it is proposed to take to protect the interests of those retained for a longer period.     It will not be easy to decide when the right moment has come to focus attention on thesubject and it would be helpful if we could have the views of the-hiofs of Staff on this at an early date.     There is little doubt that parliamentary pressure for information will increase and it must also betome in mind that, once we have got into detailed discussions with industrial organisations, some measure of publicity will probably be inevitable.Sumaary, ,10.     The proposals put forward for decision in this memorandum maybe summarised as follows:-(l) that discussions should now be opened with industrial organisa-tions on the lines suggested in paragraph 4,(s) that the Interdepartmental Committee to be set up under theChairmanship of the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Labour and National Service should cover demobilisation,civil and military, as a whole, including demobilisation priorities,(?0 that, in planning the scaling down of war production^ the predominant consideration should be that of keeping the risk ofunemployment to a minimum,(4-) that the Chiefs of Staff should be asked to report as soon aspossible on:-(a) the requirements of personnel and materials involved by a;/&apos;)            two-stage ending of the war, and(b) the timing of publicity in the Forces for the demobilisationproposals, having regard to the decision on (l) above.H.Q.732-66 F.M.3.
