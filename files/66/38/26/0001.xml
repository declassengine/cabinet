;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.W.P.(45)  27628th JUNE , 1945* COPY NO.,WAR CABINETMILK policy memorandum by the    Lord   Presidentof the Council&quot;..I circulate herewith a draft White Paper describingcertain measures designed to improve the quality of the&quot;Nation&apos;s milk supply.      At their meeting on the 16th June(L.P.(43)39th Meeting, Minute l)  the Lord President&apos;sCommittee approved this draft White Paper and asked me toarrange for it to be presented to the War Cabinet.2B The immediate reason for the proposal that special measures to improve the quality of the Nation&apos;s milk shouldbe taken and announced at the present time is that the rationalisation of the retail distribution of milk, which H; s been effected as a wartime measure with a view toeconomising in manpower and transport, has resulted in thepublic being deprived of their freedom to choose their milksuppliers.      In certain cases, therefore, persons who have previously made a point of buying wsafe&quot; milk are nowobliged to take raw untreated milk.      It is, therefore,considered incumbent upon the Government to take steps toensure that,  in all areas where schemes for the rationalis-ation of retail distribution are introduced, steps are taken as rapidly as the n^essary plant can be made available, toensure that all milk,  other than tuberculin tested (T.T.)milk or milk from ^ single accredited herd, is rendered safeby means of heat treatment.     The steps which &quot;it is proposedto take to this cim are described in paragraphs 25-32 of thedraft White Papera3*       . The measures referred to in the preceding paragraphare urgently necessary owing to special wartime circumstances.As a long term policy, however, the best way of improving the-Nation&apos;s milk supply is to.raise the standard of the milkproduced.     A-ttention must be paid, by better arrangementsfor inspection, to the health of our dairy herds and to theconditions (methods,  buildings, and equipment) under whichmilk is produced on the. farm.     This matter forms the subject,of paragraphs 1-16 of the White Paper.     The only proposal, inthis section of the White Paper to which I think I need d3?awthe special attention of the War Cabinet is that outlined in paragraph 14, where it is stated that it is the intentionof the Government to enter into consultations with the localauthorities concerned with a view to the submission toParliament of legislation providing for the transfer to the&apos;Minister   of Agriculture and Fisheries, as soon as conditionspermit, of the functions of local authorities relating tothe conditions under which milk is produced on the farm.

4. The measures described in paragraphs 17-22 of theDraft   White Paper are designed to give further encourage-raent to the production and consumption of T.T. milk.    Thequality of milk supplied under the milk for schoolsscheme - a most important point - is dealt with inparagraph 34- of the draft White Paper,5. Paragraphs 35-39 of the Draft White Paperdescribed the adjustments which will be required in applying the policy outlined in the paper to thespecial conditions obtaining in Scotland and NorthernIreland,6. The   Lord PresidentTs Committee recommend that the policies set out in the draft White Paper should be.approved by the War Cabinet, and that they should be announced in the forthcoming debate in the House ofLordss which should be the occasion of the publicationof the White Paper,J.A.Privy Council Office,Great George Street.28th June,  1943.

MEASURES TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THENATIONS MILK SUPPLYDRAFT WHITE paper i. In their Memorandum on Milk Policy issued in May, 1942 (Cmd. 6362),the Government referred to action which had already been taken in pursuanceof their policy of maintaining and if possible increasing the production, andstimulating the consumption, of milk, and outlined further measures relatingto marketing and retail distribution. Notwithstanding the many war-timedifficulties with which milk producers have to contend, the production of milkhas been well maintained. The consumption of milk in its liquid form, par-ticularly by those consumers who need it most, namely children and mothers,has greatly increased.2. In further development of this policy the Government have had underreview all measures relating to the quality of the milk supply.3. The basis of a sound milk policy, whether from the point of view of theeconomics of production or the quality of the product, is a well-bred, healthy,national dairy herd.4. The first essential towards the attainment of this objective is a soundbreeding policy. In the production of high-class pedigree breeding stock thiscountry leads the world, but the type of animal in the majority of the com-mercial dairy herds leaves much to be desired. Substantial improvementin the type of bull used has been effected by the licensing of bulls but thishas been to some extent offset by an increasing tendency in the direction ofindiscriminate cross-breeding. For this reason the Government attach greatimportance to the grading up of the national dairy herd by the adoption byowners of dairy cattle, even when they do not rear their own stock, of a policywhich will result in progressive improvement. County War AgriculturalExecutive Committees are already giving farmers guidance and, where neces-sary, directions, as to the rearing and use of better bulls, the culling of unthriftyor diseased cows, and the general development of a more enlightened breedingpolicy.   Further proposals to this end are being explored.5. A long-term programme for a general grading up of the national dairy herd with a view to increasing milk yields and improving the stamina of the animals will itself result in an improvement in the quality of the milk producedsince the type of animal which is most susceptible to disease will be graduallyeliminated.England and Wales6. The following paragraphs apply in the main to England and Wales. Formodifications in their application to Scotland and Northern Ireland see paras.35-37 and paras. 38-39 respectively.7. The Government have also had under consideration the arrangements forveterinary inspection of dairy herds.  The present position is as follows:_-(a) Herds producing Tuberculin Tested milk in accordance with the Milk(Special Designations) Regulations are subjected to a periodical test fortuberculosis, and animals reacting to the test must immediately be removed.These herds must also undergo a general veterinary inspection twice ayear, and animals showing any signs of disease which may affect the milkinjuriously must immediately be segregated from the rest of the herd, orremoved, as the case may require.** For further details see Appendix I.
(b) Herds producing Accredited* milk in accordance with the same Regu-lations are subject to a similar veterinary inspection once every threemonths, but do not have to undergo a test for tuberculosis.(c) Owing to the shortage of veterinary staff a very considerable numberof herds whose milk does not qualify for any special designation are notinspected at all.8. It is, in the Governments view, obviously desirable that every herd in thecountry should be inspected by a veterinary officer at least once a year. Thereis, however, no likelihood for some time to come that it will prove possible toundertake the additional inspections involved whilst maintaining the existingfrequency of inspections in the case of all the herds at present inspected. TheGovernment propose accordingly to introduce a more satisfactory and rationalsystem of inspection covering all the herds of the country.9. Tuberculin Tested herds will continue to be inspected once in every sixmonths, as at present.Accredited herds will be inspected at least once a year where the milk fromthe herd is subject to adequate heat treatment-]- before sale to the consumer;where the milk is not so treated the herd will continue to be inspected onceevery three months, unless the herd is Attested, in which case it will beinspected once in every six months.AH other herds will be inspected once a year where the milk is heat treated;and, as a first step, within the limits of the staff available, twice a year wherethe milk is not heat treated, with additional inspections of those herds with abad disease history.10. It is estimated that the fulfilment of this programme will involve about30,000 additional inspections for the country as a whole. J It will provide forthe first time a uniform basis of inspection of dairy herds throughout thecountry and bring the State veterinary officers, into regular contact with thosefarmers (owning &quot; non-designated &quot; herds) who most need their advice.11. At the same time the scheme for the control of diseases of dairy cattlerecently introduced under the auspices of the National Farmers&apos; Union andthe National Veterinary Medical Association, with the approval of and some financial assistance from the Ministry of Agriculture, will be continued, and every effort will be made, particularly by inspectors carrying out routineinspections, to encourage an extension of these scheme within the limits imposed by the availability of veterinary practitioners in any particular district. Thescheme provides.that for a fixed fee the veterinary practitioner undertakes theregular examination and treatment of the animals in the herd for certain ofthe.major diseases of dairy cattle, and the farmer on his part undertakes toco-operate actively in the necessary control measures.12. The Attested Herds Scheme* has been for the past ten years a feature ofGovernment policy. A valuable reservoir of tubercle-free cattle has been pro-vided by the very considerable number of herds within the scheme. Sincethe outbreak of war new entries into the scheme have been confined to T.T.herds.13. The above proposals deal with the health of the animals. The next stage in the production of good quality milk is attention to methods, build-ings and equipment. Although responsibility for matters concerning the health of the animals was transferred to the Minister of Agriculture in 1938,responsibility for the conditions under which milk is produced still remains* For further details see Appendix I.f See paragraph 26.J See Appendix II.
with sanitary authorities and also in the case of T.T. and Accredited milkproducers with County Councils. The standard of administration varieswidely throughout the country, but while appreciating difficulties which someof them experience under present circumstances the Government after very careful consideration have reached the conclusion that no substantial general improvement can be- anticipated so long as the existing system with itsmultiplicity of responsible autiiorities is maintained; transfer of the existing powers of local authorities to a central authority offers the only satisfactory solution of the problem.14. It is therefore the intention of the Government to enter into consulta-tions with. the Local Authorities concerned with a view to the submission toParliament of legislation providing for the transfer to the Minister of Agri-culture and Fisheries, as soon as conditions permit, of the functions of localauthorities relating to the conditions under which milk, including designater&apos;milks, is produced on the farm. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisherieswill thus become responsible for all matters relating to the production of milk,15. The veterinary staff of the Department who will in any case be visitingthe farm at regular intervals to inspect the animals will then also- be re-sponsible for the supervision of the conditions under which the milk is produced. Under central control it will be possible to bring about greateruniformity of standard and a continuous improvement in that standard. Co-ordination with the other work in connection with milk production on whichthe Ministry is already engaged will also be greatly facilitated.16. The Milk Testing and Advisory Scheme referred to in paragraph 6 (c)of the White Paper of May, 1942 (Cmd. 6362), is being extended, with thefull co-operation of the Milk Marketing Board and the Milk DistributiveTrade, as rapidly as conditions permit. Already arrangements have beenmade for the regular testing of milk going to all the larger depots. The Schemeprovides a means of detecting milk of poor keeping quality, a condition which may be due to faults in methods of production on the farm, and con-stitutes a substantial advance in the direction of ensuring an adequate supplyof clean milk. Where there is reason to suppose that the methods of pro-duction are at fault, the advisory services of the County War AgriculturalExecutive Committee are available to remedy matters. This work can be closely co-ordinated with that of the veterinary staff.17. The Government consider that further encouragement should be givento the production and consumption of milk free from tubercle infection.The, present arrangements regarding the sale of T.T. milk are designed toencourage production of this valuable type of milk, but they do not encourageits purchase as such by the consumer. The producer of T.T. milk receivesa premium of 2^d. per gallon for producing it whether it is sold as T.T. milkor not. If it is sold to the public as such the producer receives a furtherpremium of not less than 2d. per gallon from the distributor who has pur-chased that producers milk from the Ministry of Food. Moreover, the dis-tributor himself requires a higher margin for handling T.T. milk owing tothe greater care and work involved. The price of T.T. milk to the consumeris thus higher than the price of ordinary milk.18. Consequently much of the T.T. milk produced is not sold as such but is bulked with ordinary milk and sold as ordinary milk. This is discouragingto the producer, it involves a serious waste of effort, and the consumer isdeprived of the advantages of this special type of milk.19. The Government propose to change the basis of remuneration for theproduction and sale of T.T. milk. The premium paid direct to the T.T: pro-producer for producing the milk will be raised to 4d. per gallon and the
* See Appendix ii.27981 A ministry of Food will take over from him the responsibility for finding a market for his product.20. It is further proposed that T.T. milk should be sold to the public ata price only slightly in excess of the price for ordinary.milk (whether raw orheat treated). A maximum price for T.T. milk will be prescribed at a levelsufficient to cover the tota.l premium to be paid to the producer and the costs of distribution. Distributors will be allowed a reasonable margin, based upona costings investigation, for handling T.T. milk. They will purchase thatmilk from the Ministry of Food in the same way as they purchase other milk,any necessary adjustment in their margin being made in the price at whichthe Ministry sells such milk to the distributive trade.21. It will still not be possible, in view of transport difficulties, to ensurethat all T.T. milk is sold to the consumer as such but it will be the policy ofthe Ministry of Food to take all practicable steps to that end. They will not,however, be able in all cases to guarantee supplies of T.T. milk to everyconsumer desiring it as production is limited and distribution under war-time conditions from distant supplying areas is difficult and expensive of transport.22. The Government consider that the measures indicated in paragraphs igand 20 will accelerate the already very encouraging increase in the productionof T.T. milk which has taken place in recent years.*23. The policy outlined above aims at the grading up of the nationaldairy herd by encouraging the adoption by dairy farmers of a sound breed-ing policy; a continuous improvement in the health of all dairy herds encouragement-aged by regular inspection by state veterinary officers, supplemented by an expansion of the scheme for the control of diseases of dairy cattle and itseducational effect in convincing fanners generally of the value of diseasecontrol; an improvement in the conditions under which milk is produced on farms, brought about by central control and closer co-ordination with other activities relating to the economic aspect of milk production; and an increasein the production of T.T. milk and its consumption as such.24. Responsibility for the enforcement of the existing Statutory provisions relating to the protection of milk against infection and contamination inmilk depots and retail premises and during transport and distribution willremain with local authorities. Under the Milk and Dairies Order, 1926,dairy premises from which milk is supplied on or for sale and personscarrying on the trade of dairying are required to be registered with the localauthority of the district. The Order also contains detailed provisions relating,inter alia, to the structure of premises, the cleanliness of milk vessels andutensils, the cleanliness of methods and of persons engaged in the handling of milk and the prohibition of the sale of milk likely to cause infectiousdisease.25. As explained in the Memorandum on Milk Policy (Cmd. 6362) theMinister of Food has introduced, as a war time measure, schemes for the rationalisation of retail distribution, with the object of achieving maximumeconomies in transport and manpower. These schemes normally take theform of restricting the milk deliveries of each dairyman to an area immedi-ately surrounding his dairy or the points from which he operates. Conse-quently, where deliveries in a street are now limited to one or two dairymenmany customers now receive their milk from suppliers whom they did not themselves select. These suppliers, in many cases, do not provide the typeor kind of milk which the consumer previously purchased. For instance,a consumer who previously purchased pasteurised milk may now be receivingraw untreated milk, while another consumer who previously insisted upon
T.T. milk may now be supplied with pasteurised milk. It has thus been necessary in the national interests to deprive consumers in certain areas of freedom to choose their supplier, and this places upon the Government theobligation to ensure, as soon as possible, that all milk supplied to consumersin those areas should conform to the higher standards of quality which have previously been demanded.567 The&quot; Government accordingly propose to take power to exercise closercontrol over the quality of milk as it reaches the consumer. The Minister ofFood will be empowered by Regulation to make it an* offence to sell milk byretail in any area which he may schedule unless either (i) it is heat treated as defined by Order; or(ii) it is lawfully sold as T.T. milk; or(hi) it is Accredited milk sold by a retailer (whether producer-retaileror dairyman) who sells the milk of a single Accredited Herd.Milk will be regarded as heat treated if it satisfies the phosphatase test for adequate heat treatment, supplemented by a methylene blue test for keepingquality, as prescribed by the Minister of Health.27. Before any area is scheduled the Minister of Food will satisfy himself that adequate plant is available for heat treating the whole of the milk sold inthe area, except as provided in paragraph 26. It is the Governments aim to apply these measures of control to all areas where schemes for the rational-isation of retail distribution are introduced as rapidly as the necessary plantcan be made available.28. In all areas of population exceeding 10,000 there is a war-time Dairy-men^ Association to which all suppliers (dairymen and producer-retailers)must belong. The Executive Committees of these bodies must contain atleast one Co-operative representative, one large dairyman, one small dairy-man, and one producer-retailer. These Associations are responsible for pre-paring plans for the rationalisation of retail distribution. It is proposed to invite the Associations also to submit plans for organising in their district the heat treatment of milk.29. Consideration has been given to the question of providing independentpasteurising plant to handle the milk of small producers. Where it provesimpossible for satisfactory arrangements to be made by the trade itself tosafeguard the interests of small producer-retailers and dairymen in arranging for the heat treatment of their milk, Local Authorities will be permitted, bypowers under Defence Regulation 54B, to instal and operate pasteurisingplant. They would be treated as wholesalers for the purpose and thereforeentitled to the margin allowed for performing the wholesale function, in-cluding heat treatment.30. It is possible that some dairymen receiving milk direct from farms andsome producer-retailers might incur extra transport in taking their-milk to aprocessing station, and bringing milk away again for retail delivery, as corn-pared with the transport incurred in their present distribution. In such casesthe Ministry of Food will be prepared to consider an application for anadditional allowance in respect of extra costs incurred.31. The small dairyman or producer-retailer will not as the result of thearrangements for the heat treatment of milk run the risk of losing customersto a larger organisation, as all customers are registered with particular sup-pliers and no change is possible without Ministry of Food approval.32. There will be no added cost to the producer-retailer in submitting hismilk to heat treatment, where it is necessary. He will sell his milk throughthe Milk Marketing Board to the Ministry of Food at the price at which the
Ministry purchases all milk and he will buy heat-treated milk atthe price at which the Ministry sells to any dairyman. He will thus receivethe full remuneration guaranteed by the Government to all milk producers and the full retail margin allowed to all retailers. If he is, or becomes, aproducer of T.T. milk he will qualify for the production premium of qd. per gallon and be exempt from the heat treatment requirement in respect of thatmilk and, in so far as he disposes of his milk by retail, from the necessity of selling it&apos; through the Milk Marketing Board and the Ministry of Food.33. Apart from the alteration in the frequency of inspections of Accreditedherds as described in paragraph 9 above the present proposals do not involve any change in the present Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, until such time as it becomes necessary to provide for the transfer of functionsproposed in paragraphs 13 and 14. Milk will continue to be sold as&quot; Pasteurised &quot;, &quot; Tuberculin Tested &quot; and &quot; Accredited &quot; in so far as itconforms to the requirements of the Regulations. &quot; Pasteurisation &quot; is a form of heat treatment and pasteurised milk would comply with the pro-posed requirements. Those who desire to retain the pasteurisation processand sell &quot; Pasteurised &quot; milk will be able to do so, provided -they complywith the full requirements of the Milk (Special Designations) Regulations.&quot; Sterilisation &quot; is also a form of heat treatment which would conform to theproposed requirements. Consequently the sale of &quot; Sterilised Milk &quot; couldbe continued by those desiring to market it.34. The Government attach the highest importance to the quality of milksupplied under the Milk in Schools Scheme. It is therefore proposed tocarry out a census of all schools with the object of determining the type of milk at present consumed. In the light of this census every effort will bemade in consultation with the local Medical Officers of Health to provideheat treated milk, or T.T. milk where neither of these types of milk is nowsupplied. *Scotland35. The general standard of milk production in Scotland, although nodoubt susceptible of improvement, is not unsatisfactory. The amount ofcertified and T.T. milk produced is approximately one third of the total pro-duction of milk in Scotland, compared with some 6 per cent, in England andWales. Different nomenclature is used in Scotland for other gradesthan T.T. In addition the general price structure in operation is different,and the arrangements for milk inspection in Scotland are effectively operated by the Department of Health for Scotland and the local authorities. It isalready a statutory requirement that registered dairy herds must be inspectedonce each year.36. For these reasons the application of the policy outlined above will incertain respects require adjustment for Scotland. It is proposed to apply to scotland the arrangements for increasing the premium to T.T. producers, andfor requiring the heat treatment of milk, with prescribed exceptions, in centreswhere the necessary facilities can be provided.37. It is not, however, considered necessary to transfer from the local-authorities to a central authority their functions in regard to the inspection of dairy premises. In Scotland, the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1929,transferred to the major health authorities (County Councils and large burghs,55 in number) all powers and duties under milk legislation and accordinglythese are not, as in England, dispersed among a multiplicity of minor author-ities.   In general, a reasonably good standard of administration is maintained.See Appendix II.
From the experience of recent years, especially in all the main milk produc-ing areas, it seems clear that whatever measure of uniformity is necessarycan be achieved by local authorities with the help and advice of the Depart-ments of Health and Agriculture for Scotland. Since 1938 the Departmentof Health for Scotland have maintained a staff of milk inspectors for thepurpose of stimulating and advising local authorities in the exercise of their functions under the Milk Acts and Orders and achieving the greatest possibledegree of uniformity of standards. So far as Scotland is concerned, therefore,it is proposed that the present legislative arrangements should remain un-disturbed.Northern&apos; Ireland38. Under the Milk and Milk Products Act (Northern Ireland) 1934, allmilk must be sold according to quality grades. These are Grade A, i.e. mil&apos; \produced from Tuberculin Tested cows and bottled on the farm; Grade Brwhich is, broadly, similar to Accredited milk in Great Britain and may bebottled either by the producer or distributor; Grade C, for which bottling isnot compulsory; and Grade D, which may not be sold for liquid consumption.All persons selling Grade A, Grade B or Grade C milk require to hold a licencefrom the Ministry of Agriculture, and the herds of all licensed producersare inspected at least twice yearly by veterinary officers of the Ministry.Certain standards in regard to premises and equipment for the production and sale of milk, whether by producers or distributors, are also laid down by regulations under the Act. In addition, sampling of milk for cleanliness andbacteriological count is carried out periodically by officers of the Ministry.39. In view of the difference in conditions regarding the grading of milkin Northern Ireland and the methods of licensing and inspection both of dairycows and of dairy premises, certain adjustments will be required in theapplication to Northern Ireland of the policy outlined in the preceding para-graphs. Arrangements have already been made for increasing the premiumon the production of Grade A milk while maintaining a reasonable price level for such milk when sold to consumers. It is also proposed to require the heattreatment of milk, with prescribed exceptions, in centres where the necessary facilities can be provided. In addition, steps will be introduced designed toensure that the standard of inspection in regard to dairy cows and dairypremises are as high as those which will apply in England and Wales underthe proposals outlined. Central responsibility for the inspection of both cowsand cowsheds already exists under the Ministry of Agriculture in connectionwith the production and sale of Grade A, B and C milk, and it is proposed toextend this responsibility to cover all milk produced and the premises on whichit is produced.. 40. The policy of the Government outlined in this Memorandum can besummarised as follows: All possible steps will be taken to improve the quality of milk as it leaves the farm. To this end the health of the animals in all dairyherds will be brought under State supervision, special attention being paid tothose herds the milk from which is not heat treated before sale to the consumer;the production and consumption of T.T. milk will be further encouraged.Concurrently with these measures, arrangements will be made to subject toheat treatment as high a proportion of milk, other than T.T. and someAccredited- milk, as is practicable. Every effort will be made to provide allschools with heat-treated milk, T.T. milk or milk exclusively from singleAccredited herds.
appendix i.fuberculin Tested Milk. -   .Tuberculin Tested milk producers have to obtain a licence from the appropriate licensing authority (i.e. County Borough or County Council). A producer must satisfy the licensing authority-(a) by the production of a certificate that every animal in his herd has undergone thetuberculin test ;(b) that any animal certified as reacting to the tuberculin test has been removed from theherd ; subsequent tests are normally at six monthly intervals ;(c) by the pruduction of a Veterinary Surgeon&apos;s certificate as to the general health of hisherd ;(d) as to his arrangements for producing milk, including the structure and cleanlinessof buildings, cleanliness of milking arrangements and sterilisation of utensils ; and(e) as to the cleanliness of his milk as judged by the results of laboratory tests.&quot;^credited Milk.To become an Accredited milk producer a dairy farmer must obtain a licence from theappropriate Licensing Authority (i.e. County Borough or County Council).
