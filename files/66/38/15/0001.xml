SECRET \ / Copy No. O 0W.P. (43) 265.23rd June, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Minister of Production. *IN any discussion of the Memorandum by the Minister of State on thissubject (W.P. (43) 246) it may be of interest to my colleagues to have before them the attached paper which I&apos;wrote shortly after my return from Cairo in Aprilof last year.- At the time the War Cabinet were faced with so many grave militaryproblems that I thought it better not to circulate the paper. Since, however, thematter has now been raised, I should like my colleagues to be aware of the views which I held then and still hold.O. L.Ministry of Production, S.W. 1,23rd June, 1943.I WISH my colleagues in the War Cabinet to be aware of the serious view which I take of the march of events in Palestine.2. I do not think that great convulsions are likely during the War as longas we have large forces in the country or in nearby countries. Jews and Arabsequally realise that to oppose actively any measures taken by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in wartime might turn American and British public opinion against them.But this desire for immediate peace conceals deep and strong currents belowthe surface.3. It is not the object of this paper to discuss the intrinsic merits ofZionism. I am1 in sympathy with Jewish aspirations, but tendencies are nowevident which I think are dangerous to our Imperial interests, and I wish asfar as possible to examine them in a dispassionate way.In an interview with Mr. Shertok of the Jewish Agency I deplored theviolence of much of the Jewish propaganda, and pressed him to say whether thesolution of the problem should not be sought by teaching the two populationsto live together.He replied that if the Jews pursued such a course they would get no conces-sions of any kind from the Arabs, and excused the chauvinism of the Agency on those grounds.I asked him whether, in fact, he was not working for a Jewish NationalState to be established in Palestine by the force of British arms after the war.He found the question disconcerting, but was not ready to deny the truth of the implication.   I believe myself that States are established suddenly by.conquest[25618]Printed for the War Cabinet,  /une 1943.
or slowly by economic penetration, and hardly ever by legislation, howeverbeneficent. There is, of course, much evidence that Mr. Shertok&apos;s attitude isthe official attitude of Zionism. Appendix A gives the programme drawn up(according to reliable information) by the National Council of the Union ofGeneral Zionists in Palestine on the 7th January this year.4. It is against this background that I wish to throw into relief two other important features of present Zionist policy : the agitation for a Jewish nationalarmy, and the disquieting growth of illegal military and subversive societies asan integral part of the Jewish political apparatus.Turning to the first, great pressure is applied to us to permit the formationof a Jewish army with Jewish colours and insignia. No one doubts that theJews sincerely desire to play an active part in the fight against Germany, but no one who knows the facts doubts that they have also other primary ends in view.They desire to have a large and compact force in Palestine at the end of the war,and they believe that provided they are strong enough and united in will no british Government will be prepared to take military measures against them,and that they will consequently be able to dictate their own terms.I do not deny that such a policy might achieve its immediate object, namely,the foundation of a Jewish National State within the frontiers of Palestine asthey are drawn to-day, but I think that it would lead to more than a decade ofboth intestine and external strife with the Arabs. The population of contiguousArab countries, Syria, Iraq, Trans-Jordan, is no less than 6,000,000, to whichmust be added a million Arabs indigenous in Palestine. Opposed by these forcesit is at least uncertain that the Jewish State would survive unless continuouslysupported by British arms..5. I now turn to the illegal organisations which are being developed on an increasing scale.The Hagana and its independent offshoot, the Irgun, were originally defence forces, .and &quot;defence&quot; remains the catchword of the Hagana&apos;s preparations.Since 1939, however, its policy has been to identify itself with the local nationalistmovement. The Hagana is controlled by the Jewish Agency cabal, which alsocontrols the Histadruth (General federation of Jewish Labour) and the Mapai.It is organised on military lines, and consists of a &quot; defence force &quot; and a &quot; field force/&apos; The first-line strength of the Hagana is 25,000 men, trained and armed with rifles, bayonets, pistols, modern automatic weapons, and mortars. Thestrength of the Hagana on full mobilisation is computed to be some 100,000trained men and women, the bulk of whom would be less well armed and equippedthan the 25,000 on first call. The resources of the Hagana, however, have recentlybeen substantially increased by arms obtained secretly and illicitly from Syria,which by now are distributed throughout the country. The Hagana is financedprincipally by funds collected, by the application of various forms of pressure,from the Jewish, community.The Irgun is a similar organisation controlled by the Revisionist party, but its strength probably does not exceed 6,000 men. During and immediately afterthe rebellion up to the outbreak of war the Irgun pursued a deliberate policy of reprisals and terrorism against Arabs. During 1939 and 1940 it was responsiblefor a series of cold-blooded atrocities, which were described in its officialannouncements as &quot; the fighting acts of persons who believe that the JewishKingdom will be created by force, after having overpowered the Arab enemy inbattle.&quot; &apos;6. I must now examine shortly the effect upon the Arab world of eithergiving way to this intimidation or of permitting unlimited immigration of Jewsinto Palestine without some degree of agreement with the Arabs.I have long been inclined to think that much nonsense is talked about theArab world and its probable action in certain circumstances. Those who are most convinced that Arab unity and federation are unattainable for a centurycannot contend with consistency that the Arab world would unite as one man totake up arms against the Jews or the British if wide concessions are given to theJews. I believe such fears are exaggerated; that the probable areas over whichthe fires of revolt would spread are not as wide as generally supposed, and thatif the revolt were put down ruthlessly, there would be at least a. chance thatPersia and Saudi Arabia and the Sheikhdoms of the South would stay their handin sullen neutrality.Nevertheless, I have no doubt that Syria and Iraq as well as Palestine wouldbe in a ferment, and that, as the greatest Mohammedan Power, Great Britain
cannot ignore the effect of these discontents upon Muslim opinion in India. Thisappears to be enough to point the dangers of a policy of Jewish appeasement indespite of the Arabs.All experience shows how weak a victorious democracy is to face such aconflagration as would be lit by an Arab revolt. It is striking that the nationwhose defeat was most complete in the last war was the first to demonstrate howdifficult it is for victorious democracies to keep strong forces mobilised, and howalmost impossible to remobilise troops to deal with a threat if far distant fromtheir shores. I do not see a post-war Government standing against the surge ofpublic opinion which will sweep aside any policy which keeps husbands orbrothers under arms in distant countries. In short, the revolt would not be putdown, and an epoch would be opened in which our vital interests from thePersian Gulf to Haifa and the Suez Canal would be endangered. Again, Ihardly think the Jewish State would survive the flames.7. There are some who believe that the impact of events can be avertedand. conflicting interests reconciled by some form of Arab federation. I believethese hopes to be illusory and that Arab federation, whatever its future prospects,can have little bearing on immediate realities.The word Arab is an over-simple word. The sleek Levantine merchant isas different from the agricultural Arab as the agricultural Arab is from hisnomadic kin. Again the Arab world is divided by a sharp dynastic cleavage;the deep-rooted suspicion and jealousy of the Hashimite family will alone deferfederation for a long time, especially as it is the greatest Arab statesman, ibn saud, who is opposed, to their pretensions. Political cleavages due to rivalambitions constitute at least a serious bar.Nor is the economic life of the Arab world much less heterogeneous.I think, in short, that it would need some great event or danger to bring-even the semblance of federation to birth, and I cannot see that to add the Jewishproblem is going to ease its delivery; on the contrary, it would surely miscarry.8. The permanent strategic importance of the Middle East to the BritishEmpire needs no emphasis. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Palestineitself. There is Haifa, the principal port of the Eastern Mediterranean withits oil refinery; the pipe-line from Iraq; the air bases at Lydda, Ramleh andon the Sea of Galilee; the rail and, road communications southwards to Egypt,which cover the approaches to the Suez Canal. Y/e shall consider it necessaryto retain control of all these for an indefinite period after the war, and we shall require to keep considerable forces in the country to do so. Moreover, we haveinternational obligations for the protection of the Holy Places. Palestine is avery small country with a coastline of under 150 miles and wide tracts whichnature condemned to sterility from the beginning. Whatever is claimed,centuries of soil erosion have made reclamation of huge tracts of the restimpracticable; it is clear to my mind that there will be little room left in it fornationalist experiments.9. My first conclusion, therefore, is that we must remain in effectiveoccupation of Palestine for long after the war. We must be ready to employour forces to deal firmly with any attempt at violence dictated by politicalmotives, and to deprive such violence, from whatever section of the populationit may threaten, of the slightest prospects of success.I recognise that to achieve these objects substantial forces will be needed,and that the maintenance of such forces in Palestine in the immediately post-war period will not, for the reasons I have already given, be an easy task. I am convinced, however, that our difficulties would be immeasurably increased if wewere constrained to provide an army of sufficient strength not merely to main-tain the authority of ourselves as the occupying Power, but to suppress revoltcreated by a surrender to Jewish chauvinism.That is not all. Uncertainty about the future intentions of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment has been at the root of much trouble in Palestine, and I am convincedthat there is everything to be gained from leaving no room for doubt ormisapprehension of what our attitude will be after the war. We should makeit clear, in my opinion, that in the settlement of the Palestine problem we shallbend to no sort of coercion, be seduced by no illusion of appeasement, nor yield,in any particular affecting our vital imperial interests. Before it is too late,those who control the Zionist movement to-day should be plainly warned thatthey have embarked on a course which, if pursued, must inevitably lead to aclash with His Majesty&apos;s Government.
To sum up. I claim to be sympathetic to the Jews and to their aspirations,and to be of a liberal complexion in these matters. But I do not think that a jewish National State can be founded and maintained except by force of arms,that is by the force of our arms, and I recoil from imposing even the most-enlightened or liberal views on others at the point of the sword. Is not such apolicy in discord with the ideals for which we are fighting and with the principlesof the Atlantic Charter?I am led to believe that whatever the solution of the Palestine problem maybe, it can only be indefintely postponed by any encouragement to the excessivenationalism of the Jews. While that nationalism remains the guiding force ofZionist policy, they are themselves holding closed the door to political or culturalagreement with the other inhabitants of Palestine. Without such agreementlasting peace in the Middle East, which is as essential to the future of theNational Home as to our Imperial interests, can never be secured. This war should have taught the consequences of allowing any nation to believe themselvesHerrenvolk; it would be a tragedy of biblical severity if the Jews were the onlypeople not to learn the lesson.O.

To reject attempts to settle Jews in any country other than Palestine.2.&quot; To regard creation of a Jewish State within historical boundaries ofPalestine as an essential part of Colonisation effort.3. To regard creation of a Jewish majority in Palestine as a preliminarycondition to solution of Jewish problem.4. To aim at creating an administration that will turn Palestine intonational home of Jewish people by (a) ensuring free Jewish immigration into the whole area,(b) banning non-Jewish immigrants,(c) promoting Jewish colonisation,(d) regarding Jewish defence forces as essential.
