Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.MOST SECRET.W.P. (43) 278.Copy No.2QthJune, 1943.WAR CABINET.PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues, in agreement with the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, a copy of a note from the American Ambassador proposing theissue of a statement by the United Nations regarding Palestine (see Annex I).In delivering this note to me Mr. Winant stated that his Government would haveno objection to the issuing of a joint statement, or similar and concurrent separatestatements, by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government if his Majesty&apos;s Government preferred this.2. It will be noted that this approach from the United States Governmentcoincides with the recommendation which I embodied in a recent paper(W.P. 43/200 of the 1.0th May), that representations should be made to the americans with the same object in view, namely, that of diminishing Zionistagitation.3. We are opposed to the issue of any such statement by the United nations or, as is suggested in the note, by Great Britain, the Soviet Union, China andthe United States jointly. A declaration in suitable terms by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government would, however, have a usefuleffect in damping down Zionist agitation in the United States, which has alreadycaused us concern owing to the inevitable reaction in the Middle East. It isalso to be hoped that by showing that the extreme Zionists have gone too far andhave alienated valuable political sympathies in America, a joint statement wouldhave the effect of mobilising moderate Zionist opinion in America and elsewhere,and of dividing the moderates from the more extreme sections of opinion whoseinfluence might thereby be weakened.4. The text of the declaration proposed by Mr. Winant requires a numberof amendments. The second sentence of paragraph 2 seems to us undesirableas the reference,to a new &quot; settlement of the Palestine question &quot; may prejudice the present status quo. It is suggested that we should propose to Mr. Winantthe omission of that sentence&apos; as possibly prejudicial to internal security inPalestine and likely to increase unrest in the Arab world in general. We &quot;alsosuggest a re-draft of the last two sentences on the lines of the statement madeby Lord Cranborne before the House of Lords on the 6th May, 1942.5. Subject to these amendments, we believe there would, be definiteadvantage in issuing either a joint or simultaneous statement in Great Britainand America. The text of a statement, which we recommend should be sent tothe American Ambassador in reply, is attached as Annex II..   A. E.Foreign Office, 2Qth June, 1943.12080. [25637]
ANNEX I.       - :  mr.. Winant to Mr. Eden.Embassy of the United States of America,Dear Mr. Eden, 10th June, 1943.I HAVE just received a telegram from the Department of State requestingme to inform you that my Government is deeply concerned over Arab-Jewishtension in Palestine. The Department mentions that reliable information madeavailable to our representatives in Palestine and neighbouring areas, principallyby British official sources, is to the effect that both Arabs and Jews are well armed and confident, and that each side is simply awaiting what it considers to be suit-able provocation before resorting to force in furtherance or defence of its supposedinterests.The Department points out that the serious effects which such an eventualitywould produce upon the population of vast areas vital to the military effortrequire, of course, no elaboration. Zionist political agitation in the United Statesand elsewhere has, moreover, already caused alarm and political reactions in theArab countries which, in turn, result in a still higher pitch of Zionist activity. Aspiral of increasing tension has thus been created which feeds on itself and, in theDepartments view, disastrous results might well occur in the immediate futureunless tension is abated. It would appear, in any event, that the considerableamount of attention and energy which is being devoted to the Palestine questionis causing serious distraction from the war effort.It appears to my Government, which hopes that the British Government will agree, that the time has come to deal effectively with the situation. The Depart-ment suggests to that end the issuance of a statement, which I enclose, designedto postpone for the duration of the war a decision on the Palestine question. TheDepartment believes the suggested statement is in harmony with declared british policy, and its text has the approval of the President.The- Department points out that the statement has been drafted for issuanceby the United Nations. It feels there are definite disadvantages as well asadvantages in having a statement on this question by all the United Nations, andfor this and other obvious and essential reasons it therefore seeks the views of theBritish Government before taking the matter up in any other quarter.Among the disadvantages mentioned by the Department&apos; are- the length oftime which would be necessary to consult the other United Nations; the possibility that one or more might not feel in a position to subscribe to this statement; andthe fact that some of them have presumably little interest in the Palestinequestion. A statement by the United Nations would, on the other hand, have great weight.Taking things all around the Department is prepared to consider whetherissuance of the statement (with changes in text to take account of the fact that itwould not be issued by the United Nations) might not be preferable on the part ofa smaller group of countries, such as Great Britain, Soviet Russia, China and theUnited States.I would be very grateful to receive the British Governments views on thismatter for transmission to Washington.Sincerely,JOHN G. WINANT.Sub-enclosure.Suggested Statement by the United Nations regarding Palestine.THE United Nations, having in mind the terms of their declaration of the1st January, 1942, are agreed that, while public discussions on controversialinternational questions are in general desirable, in,order to promote an informedpublic opinion and clarification of the issues involved, it is undesirable that specialviewpoints should be pressed while the war is in progress to such an extent as to create undue anxiety among United Nations and other friendly governments and peoples.In this connexion, the United Nations have taken note of public discussions and activities of a political nature relating to Palestine and consider that - it
would be helpful to the war effort if these were to cease. As is the case of otherterritorial problems, it is not, in their view, essential that a settlement of thePalestine question be achieved prior to the conclusion of the war. Nevertheless,if the interested Arabs and Jews can reach a friendly understanding through their own efforts before the end of the war, such a development would be highly desirable. In any case, no decision altering the basic situation of Palestine shouldbe reached without full consultation with both Arabs and Jews.ANNEX II.Re-Draft.Suggested Statement by the Governments of the United Kingdom and theUnited States regarding Palestine.THE Governments of the United, States and of the United Kingdom, having in mind the terms of the United Nations&apos; declaration of the 1st January, 1942,are agreed that while public discussions on controversial international questions are in general desirable in order to promote an informed public opinion andclarification of the issues involved, it is undesirable that special viewpointsshould be pressed while the war is in progress to such an extent as to create undueanxiety among other friendly governments and peoples.In this connexion, the Governments of the United States and. of .the UnitedKingdom have taken note of public discussions and activities of a political naturerelating to Palestine which they consider are prejudicial to the maintenance oftranquillity and public order in the Middle East. His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe United States Government consider that these speculations should cease andthat all efforts should, be concentrated on the war. Continued controversy duringthe war period can only prejudice the chances of future agreement, although,as stated on more than one occasion in the past, any progress which the arabs and Jews can make towards agreement regarding Palestine will be warmly welcomed. In any case, as His Majesty&apos;s Government have already stated, no decision affecting the basic situation of Palestine should be reached^ without full consultation with all concerned, including both Arabs and JewsyV The UnitedStates Government are in full accord, with this assurance. I   \[but they wish to makeit clear that they have no intention ofperwmitting or acquiescing in maize&amp;se&amp;eBc-changes of any kind in the status ofPalestine,-, 11 /
