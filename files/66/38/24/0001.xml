Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943..SECRET.W.P. (43) 274.25th June, 1943.WAR CABINET.REDISTRIBUTION OF PARLIAMENTARY SEATS.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.AT their meeting on the 16th June (W.M. (43) 86th Conclusions, minute no. 5) the War Cabinet decided (1) that there should be legislation for theappointment forthwith of a Commission to recommend a scheme of redistribution,and (2) that the question whether the proposed legislation should create per-manent redistribution machinery was to be deferred pending consideration of afurther memorandum by the Home Secretary.&apos; (1) Redistribution involves three separate processes : (a) the laying down ofgeneral principles and rules on which the redistribution is to be based; (b) the detailed work of preparing a scheme for delimiting constituencies in accordancewith those principles and rules; and (c) the approval by Parliament of such ascheme. In 1917 the first process was carried out by a Speaker&apos;s Conference(which dealt also with many matters of electoral reform), and the second processwas entrusted to Boundary Commissions appointed by the Home Secretary andthe Secretary of State for Scotland. These Commissions consisted of the Speakeras Chairman and four or five members from the Departments directly concerned.Effect was given to the schemes prepared by these Commissions by provisions inthe Representation of the People Act, 1918.The view of the Departmental Committee was that the general principlesadopted by the Speaker&apos;s Conference of 1917 are applicable to any future schemeof redistribution; and it is proposed that the Bill shall contain provisions setting out the principles on which redistribution is to be based, and shall provide for themaking of working rules governing the procedure of the Boundary Com-missioners.The Bill will also provide for the creation of a Boundary Commission. TheDepartmental Committee recommended that the Boundary Commission should consist of the Speaker as Chairman, representatives as regards England andWales of the Home Office, Ministry of Health, the Registrar-General, and theDirector of the Ordnance Survey Department, and representatives as regardsScotland of the Scottish Home Department, the Registrar-General for Scotland;the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey Department, and possibly, as in1917, a Court of Sessions Judge and a Sheriff Substitute.The Bill would further provide that, after the Boundary Commission had prepared its scheme, the scheme should be submitted to Parliament for approval.In accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet, a Bill will be prepared on these lines, but, as matters relating to electoral registration are more urgentthan the question of redistribution, I suggest that it would be wise to have twoBills and to embody the provisions relating to redistribution in a separatemeasure.In the framing of this Bill various questions of policy will arise, and I would suggest that it would be advantageous to keep in being the Cabinet Committeewhich considered the Report of the Departmental Committee on ElectoralMachinery, in order that such questions may receive preliminary examination bythis Committee before the draft Bill is submitted for approval to the Cabinet.(2) As regards the question whether there should be permanent machinery forredistribution, the Departmental Committee pointed out that in the absence of any permanent machinery the Parliamentary system labours under the disadvantage[25628]Copy No.
&quot;of accumulating maldistribution until the need for adjustment has becomeextreme.&quot; Hitherto, they said, &quot;redistribution has been nobody&apos;s business.&quot; they pointed out that it ought, like electoral registration, to be a normal and regularpart of the equipment of the Parliamentary system, that it is a grave defect of ourParliamentary system that maldistribution should continue for long periods, andthat something in the nature &quot;of a positive upheaval&quot; should be required-tosecure the proper adjustment of constituencies to changes in the distribution of population. .    .        .they further suggested that there would be special need for the existence ofsome standing machinery for redistribution purposes during a considerable period after the post-war General Election. It is unlikely that a redistribution carriedout for the purposes of the first post-war General Election would remain valid forlong, since substantial changes in the distribution of the population are to beexpected during the post-war years.The Committee pointed out that their proposal would not involve thecreation of a new Government Department, and that it would not be necessary forthe proposed Standing Commission to be constantly in session. The commission would only meet when required, though it would keep constituencies constantlyunder observation. The Committee&apos;s proposal was that the proposed BoundaryCommissioners should remain in being, should make a review of the state of constituencies during the life of every Parliament and should, whenevernecessary, submit to Parliament a redistribution scheme.In my view the arguments in favour of a Standing Commission set out bythis Departmental Committee, which represented all political parties, arestrong. Under modern conditions it is unlikely that the distribution of popula-tion will remain static for long. It is an essential requirement of properParliamentary Government that there should be an. equitable; adjustment&apos;of constituencies to population, and the absence of any arrangement for &quot;bringing to the notice of Parliament periodically information as to maldistribution and proposals for its rectification is a serious defect.; -;I recommend, therefore, that the Bill which deals with redistribution should include provision, for setting up permanent redistribution machinery on the lines recommended by the Departmental Committee.H.
