In combat, seven enemy night-fighters were destroyed and two probably destroyed by bombers.The Bochum-Gelsenkirchen district produces a third of the Ruhr coal andcontains important railway communications, steel works and synthetic oil plants.Bp chum is less compact than other towns in the Ruhr and, the objectives are moreividely scattered..Elberfeld, the western portion of Wuppertal, was subjected to a concentratedattack which is believed to have caused notable destruction. Good visibility inthe early phase enabled ground detail to be identified until obscured by smoke fromthe many large fires which developed around the marker bombs.Blind-bombing technique was employed in both the other major attacks and.,in each case, bombing, though initially somewhat scattered, became moreconcentrated as the operations proceeded.Small-scale harassing attacks were carried out on Hamburg and Duisburgby Mosquitoes.A total of 75 intruder sorties were flown over France and the low countries, during which three enemy aircraft were shot down for the loss of oneTyphoon.Mediterranean.Italy and Sicily.31.

Othersuccessful attacks were made against a factory at Pozzallo, a sulphur refineryand railway yard at Licata and an airfield at Gerbini.Sardinia.32. Twenty-four Mitchells (B. 25) with an escort of Lightnings (P. 38)bombed Golfo Aranci (9 miles N.E. of Olbia) and damaged the jetty and shoreinstallations and obtained hits on two ships, one of which was set on fire.

They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other, than United Kingdom and Eire.
