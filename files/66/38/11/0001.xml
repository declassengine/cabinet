Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 261.23rd June, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF MAY 1943 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.NEWS of the complete victory in Tunisia, which coincided with the UnitedKingdom Prime Ministers visit to Washington, evoked fresh tributes ofadmiration for Mr. Churchill and his gift of &quot; inspiring peoples of other nations with confidence in his statesmanship and faith in his sincerity.&quot; After his speech to the United States Congress, comment crystallised on the subject of thewar in the Pacific, the general view being that all doubts about future british policy in the war against Japan had been finally dispelled. The participation inthe discussions at Washington of Mr. Mackenzie King, and the Canadian defence minister and Chiefs of Staff, gave considerable gratification. The generalCanadian opinion seems to be that there is now every expectation of holdingJapan while we settle with Germany, but no reasonable expectation of holdingGermany while we settle with Japan.2. Marshal Stalin&apos;s May Day Order to the Soviet Forces (described as thefirst generous tribute paid to the work of the Allies by the Russian leader)3 andhis announcement of the dissolution of the Comintern, were greatly welcomed.3. As a result of Lord Bennett&apos;s remarks about the formulation of indepen-dent foreign policies by the Dominions, it has been suggested that machinery should be created for co-ordinating the foreign policies of the various membersof the British Commonwealth of Nations.4. Consequent on the increase in the number of Canadian departmentsduring the war, a Bill has been passed by the House of Commons authorising theappointment of ten &quot;Parliamentary Assistants,&quot; whose functions are roughlyequivalent to those of Parliamentary Under-Secretaries of State in this country.Seven have already been named.5. Early in May the President of Bolivia paid a brief official visit to Ottawa.As this was the first occasion on which a visit by the Head of a South AmericanState, while in office, had been made, Canadians were duly gratified.6. In Toronto the Provincial Government (Liberal) has suffered abouleversement by the election at a party caucus early in the month of Mr. HO.Nixon as leader of the Ontario Liberal party. Mr. Nixon was a member of theLiberal Administration of Mr. Mitchell Hepburn, and is understood to have been deliberately passed over for the Premiership at the time of Mr. Hepburn&apos;resignation last autumn. Mr. Gordon D. Conant actually succeeded Mr. Hepburnas Premier.7. There has been a steady increase during recent months in discussion aboutCanada&apos;s civil air transport position in the post-war world.   One important[25591] . b
point has been common to ail those who have expressed their views, namely, a growing realisation of the fact that Canada&apos;&apos;s geographical position is such thatit will be possible for her to take a strong line in negotiations with other countries,particularly with the United States, in insisting upon the conditions under whichtransit facilities will be granted.8. The general trend of opinion envisages conditions in which each country will give official backing to one or more of its commercial air lines to compete onthe various inter-Continental routes with the air lines of other countries. that canada is prepared to press her claims is taken for granted, and Mr. mackenzie king&apos;s recent statement, to the effect that Trans-Canada Air Lines is to be thechosen instrument of the Canadian Government for this purpose, has accordingly been welcomed. A significant development, in this connexion, is the arrangement whereby trans-Canada Air Lines will operate a small trans-Atlantic service inco-operation with Transport Command. The activities of the British overseas airways Corporation, now operating in conjunction with the R.A.F. transport command at Montreal, are eyed with a mixture of admiration and rivalry. Oneopinion is that Canada is large enough, geographically, to support more than oneprincipal air line, and fear has been expressed that, when new routes have beenprospected through the efforts of private enterprise, they will be in danger ofexpropriation as soon as they have reached main-line importance. Anothersection, led by Colonel Drew, the leader of the Conservative Opposition inOntario, urges that the Empire should stand together in the post-war worldagainst the United States and other possible competitors and set up one singleBritish overseas air line.9. A number of labour disputes occurred during the month, the mostimportant being a strike at the Boeing Aircraft plants in British Columbia.Naval, Military and A ir A activities.10. - The United Kingdom Government has offered as a gift to the royal canadian Navy the four Destroyers Griffin, Decoy, Fortune and Express. TheCanadian Government has accepted the offer and the four destroyers are nowbeing taken over.11. During May one more R.C.A.F. Squadron became operational makinga total of 31.in the United Kingdom and two overseas; this Squadron is No. 432equipped with Wellingtons. Three other Wellington Squadrons were temporarily-arily suspended from operations in preparation for moving overseas.12. Several squadrons were notified of intended changes in equipment which include the upgrading of some of them from Medium, to Heavy bombers; No. 426 isto have the new Lancaster II aircraft. These changes are due to take place inJune, when it is also proposed to form two new squadrons, one with Wellingtonsthe other with Halifaxes; they will be numbered 433 and 434 respectively.13. The month was noteworthy for exceptional activity by units of bomber command in which Canadian squadrons fully shared; the recent increase in thestrength of the R.C.A.F. and in the part it is playing in attacks on Germany maybe realised from the fact that sometimes on a single night as many as 120 R.C.A.F.bombers have been despatched. During May six fighters, 38 bombers and oneflying boat were reported missing.14. No. 403 Spitfire Squadron destroyed seven German fighters. No. 405Halifax Squadron is training for Pathfinder duties. No. 413 Catalina Squadronhas started a fortnightly service between Ceylon and Australia. Np. 416 SpitfireSquadron claimed six F.W. 190 destroyed. No. 417 Spitfire Squadron is still inaction in the Middle East, chiefly on convoy escort duties and patrols. No. 423Sunderland Squadron flew.617 operational hours during the.month on convoy escourt and anti-submarine tasks.Economic and Financial. &apos;15- The &quot;War Appropriation (United Nations Mutual Aid) Act, 1943,&apos;&apos;was passed by the Canadian Parliament towards the end of May. The body, howcalled the &quot; Canadian Mutual Aid Board,&quot; which is to administer the Act,:hasheld its first meeting, but the manner in which the Board will operate and theprocedure which it will adopt have not yet been settled. , :;:;,,:.)
16. Two other important measures involving financial assistance by canada to the United Kingdom have been completed. The first was the Memorandum ofAgreement between the two Governments, signed on the 20th April, whereunderthe Canadian Government undertook to accept financial responsibility for the full cost of Royal Canadian Air Force squadrons in the United Kingdom and certainrelated Air Force expenditure. The second was the Agreement of the 27th May,whereunder the Canadian Government purchased at cost price from the UnitedKingdom Government munitions factories built at the.latter&apos;s expense in Canada.On top of her 1942 &quot; billion dollar gift &quot; Canada has, by these two Agreements,by the Mutual Aid Act,, and by certain additional and connected decisions,undertaken to relieve the United Nations (mostly the United Kingdom) ofexpenditure of the order of $ 1,800 millions. The effect should be to enable theUnited Kingdom and other British Commonwealth countries to finance their purchases from Canada until well into 1944 without running into debt.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.17. The greatest interest wTas aroused by the Washington Conference, andin particular by the references to the war in the Pacific. Mr. Churchill&apos;s speech to the United States Congress, and his subsequent reference to &quot; our belovedAustralia and New Zealand,&quot; have given immense satisfaction to Australians!The general view now taken in Australia is that the &apos;&apos; Hitler first &apos;&apos; strategy isquite consistent with a substantial increase of supplies to the Pacific area, andalso to China, whose ability to withstand further periods of war is, however, beingincreasingly questioned.18. At home the labour situation continues to be bad, and public dissatisfaction-tion with the Government, on this and other issues, is steadily rising. It is realised that the good handling of the labour question is going to be theGovernments supreme test. The Army had, for instance, to do the work ofdockers, who are on strike, and there has been a strike of 30,000 metal workers.There is widespread realisation amongst the Australian public that these labourtroubles are playing into the hands of the enemy. There are also calls for moresacrifice on the home-front.19. An analysis of recent loan figures showed that only one in six out ofAustralia&apos;s-wage and salary earners made any contribution. The need to reduceconsumers&apos; spending power is being strongly urged because of the opposition, tothe Price Stabilisation Scheme.20. In discussion of air communications the opinion has been expressed thatcommunications between the United Kingdom&apos; and Australia are sufficientlyimportant to justify the development of a second Pacific air route after the war.21. As a result of pressure from the public, National Security Regulationshave now been issued which provide for the calling up of any person who, .byfailure to perform his obligations under an industrial agreement, causes a stoppage to a protected industry.Naval, Military and Air Activities.22. H.M.A.S. Benalla and H.M.A.S. Cootamundra (minesweepers) have nowbeen commissioned and H.M.A.S. Cowra (minesweeper) was launched on the 27th.23. Fuel oil tanks with a total capacity of 25,000 tons have been completed at Brisbane.24. 2nd Australian Corps, comprising 6th, 7th and 9th Australian JungleDivisions, A.I.F., has completed concentration in Queensland. A United StatesEngineer Amphibian Brigade has been allotted to this corps.25. It has been decided to form an Australian corps of Electrical and mechanical Engineers. The effect of this decision will be that suitable tradesmenat present employed in the Australian Army Ordnance Corps will be withdrawn and form a separate branch of the Service under its own Director. The formationof a separate Australian Army Catering Corps and Australian Army DentalCorps has also been approved.26. The selection of candidates for Officer Cadet Training Units has been modified by the appointment of pre-selection boards to examine any candidatewho applies for appointment to commissioned rank.[25591] B 2
.27. News has been received from Geneva of 5,827 Australian prisoners ofwar in Japanese hands located as follows : Malaya 2,852, Borneo 1,466,Thailand 1,304, Korea 91, Japan 68, Formosa 46.28. United States forces in Australia now total 172,504, of which 122,231are ground troops.Economic.29. A further change in connexion with food control in the Commonwealthhas recently been effected and the production, organisation and procurementof all food-stuffs--previously co-ordinated by the Department of Supply is nowvested in the Department of Commerce.30. The new Division of the Commerce Department, under the control ofMr. J. F. Murphy, will be responsible for supplying the Allied forces in theSouth-West Pacific, civilians and overseas requirements.NEW ZEALAND.31. - News of the Tunisian victory gave great joy to New Zealand, whosetroops have played so gallant a part, including the capture during the last phase of the Takro Una heights by Maori forces, throughout the whole course of thestruggle in North Africa. Great tributes were paid to Mr. Churchill, and tothe work of the Royal Navy, whilst General Montgomery has rapidly become a popular hero.32. The New Zealand public shows willingness to accept butter rationing,should this be necessary in order to maintain the level of exports to the UnitedKingdom. A statement by the New Zealand Minister of Agriculture and marketing that the United Kingdom Government had asked that butter shouldbe rationed in New Zealand to enable the United Kingdom ration of 2 ozs. tobe maintained was criticised on two grounds (a) for the implication that theNew Zealand Government have not given immediately favourable considerationto the United Kingdom request, and (b) for not producing convincing evidencethat requirements could not be met by increasing production rather than by theintroduction of rationing.33. Mr. J. G. Coates, Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1925 to 1928,a Member of the War Cabinet, and Minister for Co-ordination of the armed forces, died on the 26fch May. For many years Mr. Coates rendered valuableservice to New Zealand and to the Empire, and the United Kingdom HighCommissioner reports that the loss of his powerful driving force will be greatly felt in the New Zealand war effort.34. In a speech on Post-War Settlement, Mr. Nash is reported to have said, &quot; If we think we can continue to hold this country on a population of one and three-quarter million, then we are dreaming.&quot; He added that the resourcesof New Zealand could support five or six million people.35. A good deal of interest is being taken in the possibilities of post-war-tariff revision. It is thought that the abolition of tariffs between the UnitedKingdom and New Zealand would be dependent on similar action by the UnitedStates.36. The fairly widespread &quot;extension &quot; of the Easter holidays caused bythe absenteeism of workers in essential industries has been strongly criticised by the New Zealand press.37.   A general election is to be held throughout New Zealand in September.Naval, Military and A ir A activities.38. The War Cabinet has decided to hand over two Corvettes to the New-Zealand Government as a free gift.39. H.M.N.Z.S. Monowai has left for the United Kingdom to be converted into a transport.40. At the beginning of the month the 2nd New Zealand Division was onthe left of the 8th Army and in touch with the French 19th Corps. It took part in various attacks which all met with strong resistance until the Axis
troops, overwhelmed by the force of the Allied attack further north, finallysurrendered. The&apos; division, was subsequently withdrawn. Meanwhile, its future employment was being deliberated by the New Zealand Government whichhas now finally decided that the division is to remain where it is. About 6,000men of those who have been longest away from home are to return to NewZealand and will replaced by reinforcements. During the time this relief is taking place, the 2nd New Zealand will be reorganised to include 4th NewZealand Armoured Brigade.41. An agreement has been made between the New Zealand Governmentand the Governor of Fiji by which the latter agrees (a) To place the Fiji militaryforces under the general military control of the New Zealand General Staff, and(b) To incorporate the Fiji Mobile Brigade in a New Zealand Division or other british formation.42. A delegation of the Royal Canadian Air Force has arrived in NewZealand to undertake the co-ordination of the Canadian and New Zealandsections of the Empire Air Training plan.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.43. A general election is to be held on the 7th July. By advancing it tothis date the Government hope to benefit from the wave of enthusiasm engenderedby the Tunisian victory. While there is general confidence about the Govern-ment&apos;s return to power, the prospect rouses little enthusiasm among large sectionsof its supporters, whose attitude is summed up by the Natal Witness. &quot; TheUnited Party is bound to win the election. It will not win it because of the energy of the Government in prosecuting the war. It will win it, firstly, becauseMalan does not want to win, and could not face the consequences in power of apolicy he advocates out of power, and, secondly, because there is no alternative to the present Government.&quot; In his election speeches, Dr. Malan is taking pains to rebut the charges that he is responsible for the divisions amongst theOpposition parties. His aim is clearly not to win what could only be a highlyembarrassing victory at the present time, but to smash the rival opposition parties so as to facilitate a return of his own party to power when the war is over. He has, indeed, said that if the Nationalists were returned it would notnecessarily mean an immediate end to South Africa&apos;s participation in the war,for Germany and Italy might not be willing to conclude peace with South Africaimmediately! The Nationalists are perturbed at the number of candidates put up by the Afrikaner Party, under Mr. Havenga, and by the Ossewa Brandwag.Mr. Havenga bitterly compared Dr. Malan&apos;s refusal to come to terms with theother Opposition parties for electoral purposes, with the actions of the united party, who have made an effective electoral agreement with Labour. In this latter connexion, however, efforts to arrange a truce between the Labour and dominion Parties have so far been a failure. An Independent Labour Party,which will put up rivals to the Government candidates in three Randconstituencies, has been formed by the Left Wing section of the Trades andLabour Council, which disapproves of the continued co-operation of the officialLabour Party with the United Party led by General Smuts. The Trades andLabour Council has resisted efforts of Left-wing Unions to obtain its support forthe formation of a new Trades Union Political Party.44. The Nationalists have expressed the view that the Lease-Lend negotia-tions will lead to an increase in the dependence of the Union on theUnited States.45. Discontent in the army, including the returned First South AfricanDivision, is causing some concern in Government circles. Only 30 per cent, ofthe troops have volunteered for service outside Africa, although it was expectedthat 90 per cent, would do so. The Government has, too, been criticised for theineffectiveness of its food policy, to which is attributed the sharp rise in prices(milk 30 per cent., meat 30 per cent., fruit and vegetables 64 per cent.) and the severe maize shortage, which, together with the high price fixed by theGovernment, is causing much hardship, especially among the natives.46. The resolution of the&quot; Southern Rhodesia Parliament urging aconference of African Governments, for co-ordination of tr^ development ofSouth and Central Africa, aroused lively interest in the  Union, and was
described as &quot; a development of wide significance for our continent.&quot; Theprospect of a Pan-African Federation is being envisaged, and it was remarkedin this connexion, &quot; Federation would not necessarily mean uniformity of native policy. The British Colonial Office is unlikely to relinquish its responsibilitytowards millions of natives who populate African territories unless the Union isprepared to revise its present native policy.&quot; It is thought that far-reachingmeasures of economic co-operation are well within the bounds of practical politics.The Transvaalers&apos; reaction to the suggestion of federation between SouthernRhodesia and the Union is a characteristic insistence that bilingualism wouldhave to be fully adopted in Southern Rhodesia; &quot; If Southern Rhodesia seekseconomic or other advantages from the Union she will have to pay the price ofacknowledging the rights and demands of the Afrikaner side.&quot;Naval, Military and Air Activities.47. One of the most important recent military developments in South Africahas been the introduction of a new General Service Oath which is now being-signed by volunteers willing to serve outside Africa. This is an importantevolution, and may be considered to represent an advance upon general publicideas, since even as Recently as the beginning of the war there was considerable discussion as to whether South African troops had any legal right to fightbeyond the Limpopo River. An Oath was subsequently taken to fight anywhere in Africa, which means that Union troops can be sent to any part&apos; of the Africancontinent, but not outside the continent without special sanction from Parlia-ment. This sanction has now been given, with the consequence that those whovolunteer may serve in any part of the world considered necessary. At present only those recruits who are willing to take the new Oath for overseas service arebeing signed on.48. As a partial consequence of the problems which have arisen from thenew General Service Oath, it was decided to send the 6th Armoured Division,which was intended to be kept in the Union, to the Middle East. The Divisionwill include troops who have already been training in the Middle East for sometime and others who, although they have arrived more recently, have neverthelessdone a considerable amount of training in the Union before their departure.Again, as a consequence of the new Oath and depending upon the response to it,general ideas as to what further troops can be supplied for foreign service mayhave to be modified.49. Units of the Southern African Air Force have been constantly in opera-tions throughout the Libyan campaign and moved forward with the Eighth Armyinto Tunisia. 16 Squadrons of the S.A.A.F. have been serving &quot;up north,&quot;besides some fighter aircraft in East Africa and general reconnaissance aircraft in Aden and West Africa.NEWFOUNDLAND.50. The announcement as to the proposed despatch of a ParliamentaryMission to Newfoundland has been received quietly in Newfoundland andexpressions of opinion in the local press have not been very numerous. Thoughthe Mission has been assured of a hospitable reception, some critics have askedwhether a Mission without authority to deal with the constitutional issue will serve any useful purpose. The Governor is, however, of opinion that theMission should be able to gather impressions and information which will be ofgreat value in the future consideration of the constitutional problem.51. The iron ore mines at Bell Island have now resumed work on a four-days-a-week basis, and shipments of ore to Canada have been resumed. a trade Disputes Board has been appointed to settle outstanding questionsbetween the Company and the miners as to wage rates and conditions of work.EIRE.52. Mr. de Valera announced in the Dail on the 26th May that the Govern -ment had advised the President to issue instructions for the holding of a GeneralElection. . Accordingly the President directed on the 31st May that a GeneralElection for members of the Dail should take place. Polling day will be on the22nd June.    .
53. Opening the Government party&apos;s election campaign at Limerick on the8th May, Mr. de Valera pointed out the necessity for good relations between Eireand Great Britain. All quarrels had, he said, been removed with the exceptionof one outstanding matter (presumably a reference to partition), but he believedthat statesmanship of both sides would bring about a solution to that matter, too.54. Mr. Sean 0&apos;Kelly made a similar reference to partition in a speech in county Cork on the 15th May. &quot; We have only one big political problem, andthat is partition. I believe honestly and sincerely that if God spares Mr. de valera, he is the only man in Ireland who has the wisdom, knowledge, experience and courage to end partition.&quot;55. At a meeting of his constituents in Monaghan on the 31st May.Mr. James Dillon said : &quot; I want to see the United Nations win. Victory forthe other side will mean the Nazification of our people, and our people cannot beNazis and Catholics.   Anyone who wants the United Nations destroyed is my56. On the 5th May the Minister for Finance, Mr. Sean 0&apos;Kelly, presentedhis budget to the Dail. No changes in taxation were proposed. Income taxremains at 7s. Qd. in the pound. Net expenditure was estimated at  45,137,000and revenue was estimated at  41,582,000, leaving a deficit of  3,555,000 whichwould have to be covered by borrowing. Mr. 0&apos;Kelly said that notwithstandingmany difficulties, revenue was buoyant and trading interests were entitled to aspecial word of praise for the manner in which they carried on.57. The growing prestige of the Moslem League, to which reference wasmade in the report for April, received a further impetus in May from theformation of a Moslem League Ministry in the North-West Frontier Province.This Province, though predominantly Moslem, had a Congress Ministry from1037 to 1939. Since the resignation of the Ministry in the autumn of that year it has been administered by the Governor under Section 93 of the Government ofIndia Act. The Moslem League, previously weak in the Province, appears tohave steadily built up for itself a following from among Moslems who wereovercome by a feeling of frustration under Congress leadership. Six of the elevenProvinces are now under ministerial government, and there is some reason to expect that the example set in the Moslem Provinces will be followed in the HinduProvinces by moderate elements.58. Late in May the Government of India announced that they had receiveda request from Mr. Gandhi to forward a short letter from him to Mr. Jinnahexpressing a wish to meet him. The letter was a response to a challenge madeby Mr. Jinnah in addressing the Moslem League session late in April, when he invited Mr. Gandhi to write to him if he was really willing to come to a settlement with the Moslem League. The Government of India stated that they were notprepared to give facilities for political correspondence or contact to personsdetained for promoting an illegal mass movement which has not been disavowed.When interviewed on this statement Mr. Jinnah said that there was really nochange in policy on Mr. gandhis part and no desire to meet his suggestion thatMr. Gandhi should write to him abandoning his programme of civil disobedienceand offering to come to a settlement with the Moslem League on the basis of pakistan.59; Early in May it was announced that the vacancies on the Governor-GeneraPs Executive Council caused by the resignation of. three members inconnexion with Mr. gandhis fast had been filled by the appointment of twoHindus (one formerly Premier in the Central Provinces) and one Moslem (the lateHigh Commissioner for India in London). Of the fourteen members of theCouncil ten are now Indian; four are Hindus, four Moslem, one a Sikh and onebelonging to the Scheduled Castes.60. Continued disappointment over the Arakan campaign was offset byenthusiasm over the victory in Tunisia, and the surrender of von Arnim to theFourth Indian Division caused special gratification. Domestic matters engrossthe attention Of the public and there is widespread anxiety about the foodINDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.Political;
situation, the shortage of cloth and the general rise in prices.

There is nothing of special significance to report.External and Frontier Relations.62. Afghanistan. It was decided, after consultation with the SovietGovernment, to take advantage of the rather frightened state of mind in whichthe Afghan Government were as a result of their discovery of an anti-Sovietconspiracy organised by the German Legation at Kabul and of the prestige which our victory in Tunisia gained for us in Afghanistan, to bring pressure to bearon the Afghan Government regarding the activities of the Axis Legations atKabul. Sir Francis Wylie accordingly saw the Afghan Prime Minister in thisconnection on the 26th May. The Soviet Ambassador was also to make representations.   Sir Francis Wylie&apos;s instructions were (a) to ask the Prime Minister to arrest or otherwise neutralise the thirty-three Afghan subjects, mainly Pathan tribal leaders, who have beenacting as intermediaries between the Axis Legations and the Faqirof Ipi.  He was to insist on the arrest of three of them only;(b) to advise him in his own interests and working in his own time and wayto initiate measures at once to reduce the staffs of the three AxisLegations to a Minister and one Secretary each and to send home thefour Japanese engineers now working for the Afghan Government.He was to offer a safe-conduct passage home for the German andItalian diplomats; *(c) to ask him to see that no afghanistan exchange is sold to Axis Legations&quot;except to cover proved needs;(d) to give him, in order to prove the accuracy of our information, a list ofpersons engaged in the anti-Soviet conspiracy of which the AfghanGovernment already knew and photostat copies of letters from the leader of this conspiracy, who is now in jail, and Moslem malcontentsin India;(e) to warn him that, if he fails to comply with our wishes, we shall have toconsider our course of action with our Soviet allv.63. The Prime Minister, in the course of an interview which was naturallystormy, promised to give Sir F. Wylie an answer within a week to our demandfor the arrest of the three special intermediaries with the Faqir of&quot; Ipi. four days later the Foreign Minister, who was friendliness personified, informed sir F. Wylie that orders had already been issued for the arrest of two of the threepersons mentioned in.(a) above and that the third would be arrested as soon as afavourable chance occurred.. Immediate steps were being taken to control theremaining individuals on the list. The Afghan Government were consideringthe advice as to the staff of the Axis Legations, but could give no definite answerat the moment. They would, however, reinforce their control over AfghanExchange so as to deal with (c).64. This response may be considered as satisfactory so far, but further-pressure will no doubt be required to keep the Afghan Government up to the mark.65. Our demands were intentionally moderate, because we have no desireto provoke a serious crisis which might imperil the Afghan dynasty and thusadd to our enemies in that part of the world; but if we succeed in getting theAfghan Government to break up the Axis intrigues with, the Faqir of Ipi, the damage which would result to the prestige of the Axis Legations might give uspeace on the Indian frontier for the rest of the war and would greatly help usin Afghanistan.66 The Afghan Government have sought to engage a substantial number of jews of enemy origin now in Turkey to replace some of the German expertsexpelled from Afghanistan in November 1941. In view of the danger of theGermans bringing pressure to bear upon such Jews to act as agents through the irrelations still in Europe, we have informed the Afghan Government that we are
not prepared to contemplate the re-establishment of a German colony in afghanistan, even if composed of Jews deprived of enemy nationality, although in certain circumstances we would be ready to consider one or two special excep-tions.   The Afghan Government have accepted this decision.67. In March the Afghan Government introduced a code of regulations forthe conduct of commercial activities in Afghanistan. These might, if unfairlyadministered, destroy the business of Indian traders in Afghanistan, and SirFrancis Wylie asked the Afghan Government to suspend their operation in respectof Indian traders. The&apos;Afghan Government have refused this and our further action is under consideration.68. Negotiations have started for the purchase by the U.K.C.C. for despatch to Russia of the available quantities of Afghan wool. These are estimated at10,000 tons.69. North-West Frontier. Roving gangs continue to disturb Waziristanand, although conditions are quieter than in April, there have been severalincidents. Hurricane aircraft were used for the first time against one gang onthe 5th May.70. Tibet. On the 7th May His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Chungking, asked the Chinese Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs to confirm our assumption thatthere is no foundation for recent rumours of Chinese troop movements againstTibet. The Acting Minister replied that he had no information but that, what-ever view of Tibet might be taken by foreign Governments, in Chinese eyes it is part of China and that the Chinese Government would probably feel that aforeign Government had no more right to interest themselves in Tibetan affairsthan in those of the Provinces of China proper. But at.a meeting of the PacificCouncil on the 20th May Dr. T. V. Soong said, in reply to the Prime Minister,that there was not, and would not be, any concentration of Chinese troops againstTibet, though the Chinese Government claimed that Tibet was part of China.The Prime Minister replied that no one contested Chinese suzerainty, and thatthe essential thing now is to avoid making new difficulties. Our informationsuggests that, actually, there have been some troop movements against Tibet, butthat the Governors of the Chinese border Provinces have no enthusiasm forpressing the matter very far. Meanwhile, the situation has been explained to theState Department, who have been asked to support us with the Chinese Govern-ment.   They are now consulting their Charge d&apos;Affaires at Chungking.Finance.71. Measures against inflation. The danger of inflation developing hasbeen occupying the urgent attention of the Government of India. In additionto the taxation imposed in connection with the Budget, and to the borrowing pro-gramme, the following are among the measures so far taken or projected : i(1) Careful stocktaking of military stores and reduction of demands,including capital expenditure, to the minimum compatible with warneed.   Overhauling of rates of profit for. Government contracts.(2) Reduction of civil defence expenditure to minimum required in lightof military appreciation of situation from time to time.(3) Increasing production of consumable goods, e.g., &quot;Grow More Food&quot;campaign. Rationalisation of textile industry now under considera-tion, designed to increase output by multiple shift system andrestriction of manufacture to a few standard variations. A schemefor distribution of standard cloth at fixed prices is just starting.(4) Central price control of wheat was tried but had to be abandoned, as the grain went underground. Control retained of purchase and distribu-tion of wheat and other more important grains. Central price controland distribution of sugar and salt successfully imposed.(5) Rationing started in certain areas, and will be extended.(6) An Ordinance designed to prevent hoarding, speculation and profiteeringwas drafted but rejected by Council in favour of tackling selectedcommodities, e.g., drugs, individually as and when Government feelthey have the necessary machinery to make control effective. Generalproposal may have to be reconsidered.(7) Raw cotton futures and options prohibited in both current and new cropexcept for delivery contracts.(8) Bombay bullion exchange induced to stop futures and options in bullion.[25591] - c
(9) Provisional summary assessment of excess profits tax and legal demandfor payment thereof in advance of regular assessment in the ordinary course.(10) Conversion of optional deposit of one-sixth of excess profits intocompulsory deposit.(11) Power to prescribe limits of bonuses and commission payments whichmay be admitted for income-tax purposes.(12) Power to prescribe limits of stocks of raw materials and stores whichcan rank as &quot; capital employed in the business &quot; for purposes of excessprofits tax.(13) Control over capital issues, &amp;c, on general lines of United KingdomDefence (Finance) regulation. 6.(14) The possibility of using gold and silver for anti-inflationary purposesis being examined.(15) A scheme of group savings for all-India is being worked out.Economic.Food.72. Wheat. Reports from India on the food position indicate a recordwheat harvest, which promises an increase of a million tons (10 per cent.) overlast year&apos;s production, and f- million tons over the last three years&apos; average. the crop is moving slowly to the markets, and prices are still high and were risingagain at the end of May.   Other spring crops are good.73. Rice.-As distinct from the wheat and other Rabi crops, the ricesituation is still a source of anxiety. The Government of India see no hope of returning to normal until Burma supplies are once more available. The blackspot is Calcutta where, up to now, Government measures have failed to produce,hidden, stocks, prices are abnormally high, and arrivals in the city are barelysufficient for its daily requirements. The Central Government have plannedsupplies for the four weeks to mid-June, and are looking for satisfactory results from the free trade measures indicated below.74. The 12 Months&apos; Plan. It is hoped that under the new basic plan2f million tons of food grains will be handled and distributed by the CentralGovernment during the next 12 months. For the purposes of this scheme, india is divided into 6 regions, each supervised by a Central Government commissioner and each comprising a number of &quot; Food Provinces.&quot; Normal trade in food-stuffsis maintained as far as possible within each province, but inter-Provincial tradeis strictly controlled by the Central Government, whose responsibility it is tomove stocks from surplus to deficiency Provinces.75. It was to be expected that the reaction of surplus Provinces to theGovernment scheme would be unfavourable, and that of deficit Provinces good. a particularly difficult situation has arisen in the Eastern Region round Calcutta,which has obliged the Central Government to restore free trade in food-stuffswithin that region. Over the country generally the Food Department is seeking to persuade local authorities to adopt an All-India point of view, but the processof persuasion will be slow and difficult.76. Rationing. Rationing plans for the towns are being considered, lessas an immediate measure than as a possible necessity in the autumn, when stocksof rice are running low. It is unnecessary and would be impossible to contemplateindividual rationing in the countryside, but detailed schemes for the largertowns are already well advanced and, in at least one case, in operation. Anofficial with rationing experience in the Ministry of Food is now working withthe Food Department of the Government of India.77. Exports. Long-term proposals for the export of grain to Ceylon andthe Arab Sheikhdoms are under review, but the Government of India has stated the maximum figure for Ceylon to be less than half Ceylon&apos;s request for 45,000tons. The rice position of Tranvacore and Cochin is &quot;becoming difficult, sincemoves under the basic plan are behind schedule.78-. Summary. In general, while the position is improved from that at thebeginning of the year, the Viceroy reports that it is far too early for India to regard herself as on firm ground as far as rice is concerned.
Naval. Military and Air Force Activities.  &apos;79.   Royal Indian Navy. The following vessels were due to be completed inIndia during April 1943 : 4 fair miles.1 72&apos; M.I,Vice-Admiral J. H. Godfrey, C.B., took over the post of Flag Officer Com-manding, Royal Indian Navy, on the 20th April from Vice-Admiral Sir HerbertFitzherbert, K.C.I.E., G.B., C.M.G.80. Military. In the closing stages of the Tunisian Campaign the FourthIndian Division was one of the formations transferred from the 8th to the1st Army. It played a worthy part in the operations leading up to and the capture of Tunis. &quot; Subsequently General Von Arnim surrendered to it. The7th (British) Armoured Division was also transferred to the 1st Army, andits troops were the first to enter Tunis. It was both gratifying and fittingthat these two divisions, which carried out the original successful advance intoCyrenaica in the autumn of 1940 and fought through all the subsequentcampaigns, should thus have been in at the death.81. Early in the month Japanese forces on the Arakan front succeeded in establishing themselves across the Maungdaw-Buthidaung road. Attempts todislodge them failed, and in consequence Buthidaung was evacuated. No enemy attacks developed against the Maungdaw area. Subsequently, however, owingto the weakness of our left flank and the high sickness rate due to malariaamongst our units, it was decided to withdraw from Maungdaw to positionsfurther North which were suited for defence. All stores were evacuated and thewithdrawal was not interfered with. Apart from patrol activity, the front has since been quiet. The Japanese are thought to be suffering from dysentery andmalaria, and may be having supply difficulties.82,   In the Chin Hills small enemy force has advanced about12 miles West of Kalemyo, probably with a view to deepening their positions inthis area before the arrival of the monsoon. Our troops have been reinforcedto deal with the threat.83. In the Chindwin area the revival of Japanese activity mentioned lastmonth has subsided.   Our troops have continued vigorous patrolling.84.   There has been no important change in other sectors.85. The reconnaissance in force by the 77th Brigade under BrigadierWingate has been fully reported in the press. Two columns with which touchhad been lost are now reported to be nearing the Assam border.86. Field-Marshal Wavell and the A.O.C.-in-C, India, attended theconference in Washington held by the President and the Prime Minister.87. Air. The R.A.F- have operated in support of our ground forces.Operations by the RAP. and U.S.A.A.F. have been continued throughout themonth on railways and communications. Attacks were made on Mandalay,Rangoon, Bassein, Magwe and towns on the Irrawaddy. A 3,000-ton ship off theAndamans was hit.88. Enemy activity was again on. a small scale. Two raids were made onChittagong, which caused no material damage and very few casualties. Out of70 Japanese planes employed, eleven were destroyed and others damaged. TheR.A.F. lost two machines.89. General. Intake of recruits for the Army in April was 54,000. Thereduction on previous months&apos; figures is largely due to the Gurkha recruitingseason having closed with a record intake of 31,000 recruits.90. In the last war 55,000 Gurkha recruits were enrolled. In this war78,000 have already been recruited.91. The Corps of Indian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers wasinaugurated on the 1st May.92. In the United Provinces the Governor reports that a post-war reconstruction and settlement of ex-soldiers on the . land is being activelyconsidered.[25591]
BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.93. Occupied Burma. A Japanese news agency message of the 8th Mayannounced the formation of the Burmese Independence Preparatory Committee.in Rangoon, which is presumably intended to draw up some sort of constitution for &apos;&apos; independent&apos;&apos; Burma. The Chairman is Dr. Ba Maw, and there aretwenty-one other members, including all the executives of- the present puppetGovernment, together with some leading Burmans of moderate opinion.94. Frontier A dministration. A detailed report of last April by an officer who has been in the Northern Myitkyina Area states that the withdrawals atthat time had left the villagers despondent; food supplies were still inadequate and the people disinclined to plant crops for the benefit of the Japanese.95. General. Encouraging accounts of opinion in Northern Burma havebeen given by the personnel of the Wingate Expedition, emphasising theco-operation and assistance received from the villagers even at grave risk to themselves, and indicating that the pro-Japanese element there is very minute;the general impression was that the inhabitants are extremely disgruntled withthe lack of security and of the amenities of life under the enemy occupation.It must be borne in mind, however, that village opinion in Upper Burma is notnecessarily representative of that of the villagers and townsmen of Lower Burmain closer touch with Rangoon and more exposed to the influence of Japanesepropaganda, which has naturally been making great play with its version of theArakan expedition.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Eastern Caribbean Fishery Survey.96. Arrangements have been made for a joint Anglo-American fisheriessurvey of the waters of the Eastern Caribbean. The object of the survey is toincrease local food supplies by locating the most suitable fishing grounds andadvising as to the best methods of exploiting those grounds. The United Statesand the United Kingdom Governments are each providing an expert officer, andthe United States Government is loaning a survey vessel free of charge. Thescheme, is being financed by a grant of  6,000 under the Colonial development and Welfare Act.   The survey is expected to take about six months to complete.British. West African Oilseed Production.97.   Owing to the serious deterioration in regard to United Nationssupplies of oils and fats, energetic action is being taken to bring production in -British West Africa to a maximum.    Action is being co-ordinated by the resident Minister in West Africa, who has made this and similar productionmatters a chief pre-occupation.98. The difficulties with which we are faced are principally those ofproviding the African peasant with a sufficient incentive to produce, the chiefnormal incentive being an adequate supply of consumer goods, the maintenanceof which is now a matter of increasing difficulty. Every effort is being madeto this end, however, and what can be done in regard to supplies from the UnitedKingdom is being done.99.. By far the most important territory, both as regards groundnuts andas regards palm products (palm kernels and palm oil) is Nigeria. Here, specialpropaganda campaigns have been undertaken, and Lord Swinton has &quot;personallysought and secured the very important co-operation of the Emirs in the NorthernProvinces.
100. The production of palm kernels in Sierra. Leone and the Gold Coastis making good progress, although supplies from these Colonies are much smaller than from Nigeria.East African Secondary Industries.101. In February the Chairman of the Industrial Development and research Board of East Africa visited this country in order to discuss thepossibility of erecting in East Africa the plant necessary to produce the follow-ing commodities sulphuric acid; glass; pottery; fibreboard and paper; causticsoda; general chemicals; lime and cement; and sulphur. These projects are tobe financed jointly by the Kenya and Uganda Governments at an estimated costof  100,000. The.various projects have been carefully examined and many ofthem have been approved and steps taken to order the necessary machinery forerection in East Africa.   The remaining schemes are still under consideration.Jamaica Imports and Exports.102. The Jamaica Food Controller paid a short visit to this country during may to discuss various problems regarding the disposal of the Island&apos;s mainagricultural products such as sugar, bananas, citrus pulp, fruit juices, spices, &amp;c,the supply of imported goods, and the steps to be taken to stabilise the cost ofliving index figure.Food Supplies.103. Ceylon, The food situation in Ceylon continues to give cause for anxiety.104. Ceylon&apos;s requirements of imported cereals are approximately 45,000tons a month, and the only sources from which we have been able to meet Ceylon&apos;sneeds are India, Australia and Egypt.105. India is, of course, the most convenient source, but her own food situation has precluded her meeting Ceylon&apos;s full needs. The Government ofIndia have provisionally proposed an allocation of mixed cereals to Ceylon of20,000 tons monthly during the six months beginning in May and confirmation ofthis offer is being awaited. Negotiations by the Ministry of Food representative in Egypt for the acquisition of Egypt&apos;s rice surplus have been proceeding ratherslowly. Of the quantity acquired to date 51,000 tons has been allocated to Ceylon.For the balance of Ceylon&apos;s cereal import requirements Australia is the only practicable source and here shipping difficulties are a serious factor. I regard it as most important, however, that Ceylon&apos;s reserves should be built up as quickly as possible to a somewhat higher level than at present and am in close consultationwith the Minister of War Transport on the situation.106. Aden. Owing to complete failure of the early rains in the Yemen andAden Protectorate, a serious famine has rapidly developed throughout the protectorate, deaths from starvation having been already reported and. cattlebeing killed for shortage of fodder. Approval has been given for special expendi-ture on famine relief and the Minister of State thinks that 20,000 tons of millet,which was the Governor&apos;s estimate of his requirements over the next twelvemonths, should be available during this period from Egypt and Iraq. Thepossibility of obtaining supplies from Ethiopia is also being explored.107. East Africa. The latest reports from East Africa show better harvestprospects than was previously expected, except in the Central and Lake Provincesin Tanganyika. It is now estimated that 20,000 tons of grain will have to be imported into Tanganyika between now and the end of March 1944, but it ishoped, to be able to meet this need from Kenya and Uganda, which should now have a surplus of maize after the harvest has begun in August.108. Negotiations referred to in my last month&apos;s report for the charter ofthe Swedish ship to carry a further cargo of maize from the Argentine to EastAfrica have unfortunately fallen through because the Swedish Government nowsay that they require this ship for the Gottenberg Service. A possibility of substituting some maize from Portuguese East Africa is now being investigated.109. Northern Rhodesia. -The latest reports show that there is a reasonableexpectation that, with the supplies already in view, the territory&apos;s requirements should be met until the next maize harvest begins to come in.
110. Mauritius. The Jast report from the Governor shows a larger require-ment of imported foodstuffs than was previously reported to me, and I am afraid that it will be necessary to continue to ship cargoes of grain from Australia toMauritius from time to time.111. The question of turning over still more land from sugar production tolocal food production has been considered, but the conclusion has been reached that on balance it would not be in the war interest to do this.112. West Africa. West Africa has been faced with a serious shortage ofsalt, which is required in large quantities by the native population, particularlyin Nigeria. This shortage arose principally as a result of the reduction in thenumber of ships returning from Suez (where they can pick up cargoes of salt).Arrangements are now being made to ship additional quantities from the UnitedKingdom and from Spain.Supplies other than Food.113. Textiles. Great difficulty is being experienced in providing sufficient supplies of consumer goods to induce peasants in the Colonies to maintain full production of the crops we require. This difficulty has been particularly seriousin West and East Africa. The most important of these consumer goods is cotton textiles. Exports from the United Kingdom to the Colonies are already at thehighest rate which the United Kingdom industry can manage, having regard ioits other commitments, and there is no readily available surplus from the UnitedStates of the particular types of textiles which are suitable for Colonial markets.The principal other source to which the Colonies have to look is India, and thehigh prices now ruling in the Indian market are causing considerable difficulties for the Colonies. I am examining this question with other Departments to see what steps can be taken to improve the position.Economic -Relations with Allies.114. Western Pacific. Mr. Robertson, Chairman of the Supply and produce Board in Eiji, has come on a flying visit to Washington and london for consultations about supply arrangements in the Western Pacific area. Themain purpose behind these visits has been to clear up with the authorities in theUnited States certain misunderstandings which had arisen concerning thefunctions of a Mission which the American Board of Economic Warfare have sent to this area, and to give a general report on economic matters generally inthe area to the Departments principally concerned in this country. these discussions have been most satisfactory.Defence.115. Civil Defence. It has been decided that Civil Defence organisationsat Mombasa should in future be maintained on a skeleton basis only, and inNairobi and other parts of Kenya that the organisations should become dormant.The position as regards other places in, or bordering on, the Indian Ocean, withthe exception of Ceylon and Aden, is under review.116. Man-Power.-^ has been agreed that Czechoslovakian womendetainees in Mauritius should be eligible for recruitment in. the A.T.S. for service in the Middle East. The question of the recruitment, of other detainees(Austrian, Danzigers and stateless persons) and Mauritians, both white and coloured,, is at present under. consideration.Proposed Replacement of United States White Troops in theBritish Leased Bases by Puerto Ricans.117. West Indies. Reference paragraph 90 of the report for April. Thisquestion has been taken up by the Joint Staff Mission with General Marshall.The latter has explained that the United States Army had been considering theproblem of finding additional employment for some 15,000 Puerto Rican troops,and had reached the conclusion that they could best be used in non-activetheatres involving a minimum of shipping. The United States Bases in theBritish West Indian Colonies appeared to be the most suitable places for their employment. General Marshall has therefore proposed that Puerto Rican unitsconsisting m all cases; of white Puerto Ricans with a knowledge of English anda high educational standard should be sent to Trinidad, St. Lucia and British
Guiana. These are the three Colonies where there is the least objection to their employment, and accordingly His. Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has been informed that,while I should prefer that Puerto Ricans be not sent to the British West Indiesat all, I am prepared to agree to General Marshall&apos;s proposal provided that itis for the duration of the war only, and that Puerto Rican troops will not be sentto other Bases without prior consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government. I havealso asked that the United States authorities should remove the coloured UnitedStates troops from Trinidad where their presence has led to disturbances.118. Western&apos; Pacific.-(a) Fiji.-r \ie 1st Battalion Fiji InfantryRegiment and one Fiji Commando have gone to Guadacanal. The departure ofthe 1st Battalion gave rise to scenes of great enthusiasm among the local people in Suva.119. (b) New Hebrides. With reference to paragraph .105 of the reportfor September 1942 the British Resident Commissioner in the New Hebrides has reported that a revised, and in his view more satisfactory, draft Agreement toregulate the conditions under which United States authorities are responsiblefor the defence of the Condominium has been drawn up following a localconference.A aviation.120. With reference to paragraphs 124 and 125 of the Report for January1943 the preliminary agreement for the formation of British West IndianAirways to operate the air services which have hitherto been operated byMr. Yerex between Trinidad, Tobago and Barbados and the Windward andLeeward Islands has now been signed. The air services were instituted byMr. Yerex in anticipation of the conclusion of the agreement, and it is hoped thatthe main agreement, the terms of which have already been agreed, to govern theoperation of the services will be concluded as soon as the Company has been formally established.Reports on Individual Colonies.121. Palestine. Among the Arabs the tendency has been to abandon anyattempt at organised political activities inside Palestine, and to rely onendeavours from outside, e.g., Iraq and Egypt. Among the Jews the clashof personal ambitions has for the present greatly confused their politics. Therehas been acrimonious comment on the proceedings of the Bermuda Conference.122. Thefts of arms and ammunition during the month were on a relativelyminor scale.123. The industrial situation has eased, but Histadruth organised a one-daystrike of Jewish civilian employees, in military establishments. Attempts to induce the Arabs to take part in the strike were unsuccessful. There has alsobeen considerable unrest amongst the Second Division of the Civil Servants.124. Crop prospects have again deteriorated because of rust infection whichis likely to reduce the yield of cereals by about 25 per cent, on the previousestimates. Owing to the prolonged rains which delayed sowing, the area undersummer crops will be at least 30 per cent, below normal.125. Considerable excitement was aroused by the police search of the jewish agency recruiting office at Tel Aviv on the 29th April. Both Jewish and Arabrecruiting figures have reached a low level.126. West Indies. A difficult problem has arisen in Dominica (and to a lesser extent in St. Lucia) owing to the continued arrival of French refugees from Martinique, anxious to join the Fighting French. By the end of May thenumber in Dominica was between 2,500 and 3,000 and it is increasing at therate of about 100 a day. Food supplies have been sent from Barbados andthe British Colonies Supply Mission in Washington, in consultation with theBritish Army Staff, is making arrangements for the despatch of further supplies.Efforts are being made by the British Ambassador in Washington to arrange with the United States authorities for the medically fit to be taken to the UnitedStates to join the French Forces and for the unfit and the women and children to be sent to French Guiana. A detachment of the Barbados Battalion of theSouth Caribbean Force was sent to Dominica on the 11th May to assist inprevention of disorder.
127. Ceylon. The Governor of Ceylon has recently been authorised tomake a further declaration with the object of giving a fresh and clear expression of the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government as to post-war constitutional reform in Ceylon. The new declaration affirms the intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment that the post-war examination of this question will be directed towards the grant to Ceylon of full responsible government under the Crown inall matters of internal civil administration, subject to the retention of control by His Majesty&apos;s Government in certain fields in which they have a continuingresponsibility. All newspapers, English and Vernacular, have expresseddisappointment at the Declaration with the exception of The Times of Ceylonwhich took the line that it would be welcomed by all but the most unrealisticcritics as a practical and generous gesture by His Majesty&apos;s Government. I havenot yet received a considered report on the reception of the Declaration in theColony from the Governor.Visit of Sir Cosmo Parkinson.128. Arrangements have been made for Sir C. Parkinson to leave thiscountry during June on a visit to Northern Rhodesia,, Nyasaland, Mauritius,Seychelles and Aden as the personal representative of the Secretary of State todiscuss with Governors various questions on which personal contact is desirable.
