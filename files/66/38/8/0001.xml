Printed for, the War Cabinet.   June 1943.MOST SECRET.W.P. (43) 258.21st June, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.SHIPPING DISCUSSIONS AT THE &quot;TRIDENT&quot; CONFERENCE.Note by the Minister of War Transport.I think some of my colleagues would like to have a Summary Report ofthe discussions which took place at Washington last month on shipping matters,and I accordingly attach short notes on the major points on which shipping was concerned. While in Washington I also took the opportunity of discussing anumber of other subjects, e.g., trans-Mediterranean convoys, Third SovietProtocol, and the problem of Chinese Seamen, but these are not of sufficientlygeneral interest to warrant my setting them out in separate notes.L.Ministry of War Transport,list June, 1943.I. Strategic Discussions.1. Much preliminary work was done on board ship on the extent to which shipping might be available for various projected operations, and this workcontinued pari passu with the military discussions throughout the &apos;&apos; Trident &apos;&apos;Conference.2. Before the conference met, both British and American shipping-authorities showed deficits of shipping available against requirements for theremainder of 1943. The British deficit on maintenance programmes for thesecond half of 1943 stood at 95 sailings (77 if &quot;Anakim &quot; were excluded), andthere was also a deficit of 60 sailings on the North Atlantic to meet the reducedUnited Kingdom import programme of 26 million&apos; tons. On United Statesaccount a deficit of 336 sailings was shown, but an analysis of W.S.A. figuressuggested, and Mr. Douglas was prepared to admit in confidential conversation,that this paper deficit was unreal. I was convinced that the United StatesServices could effect a considerable compression in their demands, and this,together with the margin of safety used by W.S.A. in calculating their figures,convinced me that in fact the United States shipping position was much betterthan shown, and that there was a real danger that vital military operations mightbe cancelled or postponed on account of a paper deficit on shipping which did not exist in fact. It thus became of real urgency to find some means of inducing the americans to write off this deficit, but first we had to give a lead by clearing ourown deficit. This we were able to do partly by bringing into account the fact that shipping losses had been below those allowed on the basis of the CCS. forecast of losses, partly by taking into account the newly increased &quot; Bolero &quot; programme and the consequential gains due to combined loading of &quot;Bolero &quot; cargo with[25603] . . copy No.  J J
United Kingdom imports, and partly by the Army accepting further cuts in their maintenance programme.3. The first reaction of the United States Services of Supply was to makeincreased bids for shipping, but in a series of week-end meetings they wereinduced to modify their demands considerably. They made a further attack on-the United Kingdom import programme, but this was successfully resisted.4.   The outcome of these discussions is given in Annex VII to CCS. 244/1.The following extract summarises the conclusions : &apos;&quot; The optimum deployment of available United Nations cargo shipping to meefthe requirements of the basic undertakings and projected operations for 1943-44 reveals the following balance in cargo ship sailings : 3rd Quarter, 1943 : 66 sailings deficient.4th Quarter, 1943 : 69 sailings deficient.1st Quarter, 1944 : 122 sailings deficient.2nd Quarter, 1944 : 123 sailings surplus.3rd Quarter, 1944 : 367 sailings surplus.The deficiencies are small, but, if properly spread over all the pro-grams concerned, the effect will not be unmanageable..&quot;L.S.I. (L)&apos;s.5. While in Washington I reverted to the question which I raised at casablanca about the use of the very large and valuable troopships asL.S.I. (L)&apos;s. The loss of any more of these ships would seriously impair our strategic mobility. The Admiralty and C.O.H.Q. have always concurred on the undesirability of using these ships, but the problem has been to find other suitableships to reduce the call on the larger types.6. Our aim was to replace all existing L.S.I. (L)&apos;s of 15,000 gross tons andover, plus&apos; estimated casualties in &quot;Husky,&quot; making 13 in all. A paper(CCS. 248/1) was put up to the Combined Chiefs of Staff, but the United states representatives asked for a little longer to consider the paper, and in consequencethe paper had not been considered when the conference broke up. The subject is accordingly being pursued through the ordinary channels of the Missions in washington.II. Bareboat Charter ot American Shipping.7. The shrinkage of the British merchant fleet, the growth of the Americanmerchant fleet have brought to the fore the possibility of obtaining a block ofUnited States new building for operation under the British flag.8. Three major advantages to the direct war effort would ensue at once ifwe were able to obtain a substantial block of tonnage on bareboat charter,namely : (i) It would effect a valuable economy of man-power, in that there is&apos; a surplus of British seamen,(ii) It would improve efficiency of operation of American ships trading on british account if they were actually operated from London. (the americans are now very short of qualified operators.)(iii) It would be easier to plan ahead if we could diminish the uncertaintieswhich arise from dependence upon ad hoc voyage allocations ofUnited States ships. The negotiation of these ad hoc allocations is a constant source of minor trouble in Washington.9. In endeavouring to get a large amount of United States tonnage ondemise charter for the duration of hostilities, I based my argument mainly on the agreed concentration of merchant shipbuilding in the United States, and on the economy and efficiency which would result, but I also drew attention to the example we had set in providing replacements for our Allies from our owninadequate resources.10. After long discussions with Admiral Land, Mr. Douglas,Mr. Harriman and Mr. Harry Hopkins, a letter was very carefully drafted^forthe President to send to the Prime Minister, recording the decision reached. Thisdecision is recorded in the letter of the 28th May which was circulated to the War
Cabinet as W.P. (43) 234. Briefly, we are to have handed over to us for operationa minimum of 15 ships a month for ten months. There is good ground to hopethat the number will,, in fact, be 20 ships a month for ten months.11. It has now been arranged that we shall take over 20 ships in July, andBritish crews are being sent over.III. United States and Canadian Shipbuilding.(a) United States Shipbuilding.12. Just before we left England I learned that the 1944 United Statesbuilding programme would fall far behind the 1943 output in cargo-carrying capacity owing to the wholesale introduction of the 15-knot Victory ships in placeof the 11-knot Liberty ship. The effect of this introduction would have been particularly severe during the first half of 1944 while the change was being effected.13. Quite apart from the fall in output involved, we objected in principle to the taking of a decision of this magnitude without any consultation with us.Sir Arthur Salter had been told by Admiral Land that the United Statesshipbuilding programme was a matter for the United States only, whereas Vcheld that it should be subject to combined planning.14. I took this point up in Washington with Admiral Land, Mi1. Douglasand Admiral Vickery; they made it plain that we should in future be invited toput forward our views as to the United States building programme.15. On the 1944 programme, the American authorities admitted that the turn-over to the Victory ship was being pushed too fast, and they agreed torecast the programme so as to increase output by introducing the faster shipsmore gradually.16. Under the revised programme for 1944 the production of Liberty ships will be increased from 307 to 802, and the production of the Victory-typereduced from 526 to 260. The net result of these two changes will be to increasethe deadweight tonnage of emergency types produced in 1944 by nearly 2 milliondeadweight tons. In the first half of 1944 the result of the new changes will be toincrease production by not less than 230 ships of 2,400,000 tons deadweight.(b) Canadian Shipbuilding.17. Early in 1941, under the Hyde Park Agreement, the United Statesagreed to purchase 100 ships from Canada, but as the ships were Coal burners itwas agreed that they should be manned by British crews and were bareboatedto M.W.T, by the United States immediately after delivery.18. Recently the United States terminated the contract and the canadian government decided that all subsequent coal burners which Were not retained for operation by the Park Steamship Company (an organisation set up by theCanadian Government to operate ships under the Canadian flag), should bebareboated to M.W.T. at a nominal hire of $1 a year. There will be some 50ships in all to be delivered under this arrangement.19. At the end of 1942, at the suggestion of the Maritime Commission, theCanadian Government decided to turn its best yards over to the building of ahoil burner similar to the Liberty ship, on the understanding that the americans would purchase and operate these vessels. Deliveries of this new ship will begin in July 1943, and there will be about 50 of these oil burners in the 1943 output.The Americans subsequently indicated. that they would hot take over these oilburners, and the question of who should operate them remained unsettled./ 20. My main object in seeing Mr. CD. Howe was to secure that these oilj burners should be bareboated to M.W.T. I found that Mr. Howe was proposing to Sell some of them to the Russian, Chinese and Australian Governments. I was able to convince him, however, that under the system&quot; of pooling shipping resourcesit would only complicate matters without improving the situation in any way togive the Russians, Chinese or Australians title to these ships. In the Case of theRussians, for example, the Americans were committed to provide ships up to. thefull capacity of overland clearance from Vladivostok, If the Russians obtainedfurther ships, they would either have to hand some back to the Americans orthey would merely congest the port and clearance facilities at Vladivostok to the[25603] B 2
disadvantage of all concerned. Similarly in the case of the Chinese, the Britishand American Governments were providing the full quantity of materialcapable of on-carriage by all routes to China. To ship any additional quantities to India would be of no advantage to anybody. In the case of the Australians, itwas much better that their shipping requirement should be assessed centrally in balance with all other requirements.21. Mr. Howe accordingly undertook to bareboat the entire output (exceptfor those ships retained under Canadian operation) to M.W.T. at the nominalrate of $1 per annum.   The ships will be returned to Canada after the war.IV. Tankers.(a) United Kingdom Oil Imports.22. The outstanding point in relation to the United Kingdom oil importswhen we reached Washington was that we had ten months in which to build up our stocks from a little over 5 million tons to the level of 7,786,000 tons requiredby the Chiefs of Staff by April 1944.23. To attain this target reserve and to meet consumption we should needimports at the rate of 1,480,000 tons a month, assuming that remedial measuresbegan at once. On the other hand, the vessels in our service were only capable of importing at a rate of 1,200,000 tons a month, a quantity just sufficient to meetconsumption.24. The most hopeful line to pursue was to negotiate for a second squadron of fast tankers to proceed direct from Dutch West Indies to the United Kingdom.Once we have obtained this second squadron we can press for an increase in the size of both fast squadrons and also for a shortening of their round-voyage time.The upshot of my discussions with the American Shipping, Naval and Oil autho-rities is that we can now confidently rely on getting -a second fast squadron of atleast 12 tankers by the end of July, if escorts can be made available and it seems probable that the escorts will be forthcoming.(b) Control of Tanker Operations.25. Shortly before I left for the United States the United States navy department had put forward a plan for setting up an &quot; Allied TankerCo-ordinating Committee&quot; in Washington. This proposal seemed likelyindirectly to put Allied tanker movements under the control of the AmericanNavy.26. I discussed this proposal before leaving with the First Lord of theAdmiralty and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Fuel and power; we agreed that the proposal must be resisted, but that it would be inadvisable to turn it down without making an alternative suggestion. It wasagreed that it was most important to avoid giving the new Committee anyexecutive authority. I hoped, therefore, to achieve an alternative organisation which would not affect existing arrangements for the control of tanker movementsbut which would satisfy, the United States Navy Department, and would obtain from them vital information which they were at present unwilling to disclose to civilian agencies.27. I discussed this matter very fully in Washington with the appropriateUnited States authorities. A point which I had constantly in mind was theneed for a world-wide tanker review relating forward estimated requirements,theatre by theatre, against estimates of available tanker tonnage. This is anessential pre-requisite of full planning, but it has not yet been possible to preparesuch a review owing to the reluctance of the United States Navy (which is in con-trol of, and responsible for, a great part of United States oil shipments) to submittheatre by theatre programmes to any civilian authority. Such a programme must form the basis for deciding competing priorities for oil shipments. the upshot of these discussions was the institution of an advisory committee and thedecision was placed on record in the following terms i In lieu of the suggestions. contained in the despatch of the 13th April,1943, from the Vice-Chief of Naval Operations to Comnaveu, it has beenagreed between representatives of both Governments to set up an informal&quot;committee composed of one representative of the Navy Department, one fromthe War Shipping Administration, and one from the British Ministry ofWar Transport./
This Committee will be furnished by all parties with all the informationnecessary for proper operation and forward planning of the use of tankers.A representative of the Admiralty will be invited by the Committee to attendwhenever questions of escorts are involved.28. The new Committee will report to the Tanker Section of the CombinedShipping Adjustment Boards, and it will be responsible, inter alia, for preparing the required world review of oil requirements related to tanker availability.(c) Reciprocal aid for oil bunkers..29. My Department had put to the War Shipping Administration a pro-posal that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared to give reciprocal aid inrespect of oil bunker supplies to W.S.A. ships and United States Army transportsin the whole sterling area, excluding Australia and New Zealand. It was pro-posed to divide United States business on a 50-50 basis between the British and american Oil Companies throughout the sterling area, excluding UnitedKingdom, Trinidad, Abadan and Bahrein. This proposal was rejected by admiral Land, who wished to retain freedom of action in nominating bunkeringagents for W.S.A. ships.30. The proposal was generous, but we held that, by being generous on thepercentage for American ships we should avoid the difficulties of includingBritish tonnage in the calculations.31. The motives of the Americans in refusing and of ourselves in pressing the proposal were, of course, both mainly directed to the post-war situation. Onthe other hand, the American aim seemed clearly to take advantage of a wartimesituation to gain business for American firms which they did not possess beforethe war and had no chance of capturing in normal circumstances. Our aim was merely to prevent the American oil companies from abusing the wartime situationin this way.32. I discussed this question with Mr. Douglas and others, and obtainedagreement in principle that the proposed arrangement was&apos; fair. Unfortunately,the moment was not opportune for the. W.S.A. to risk political pressure from the oil companies, with the consequence that W.S.A. stipulated to retain the nomina-tion of bunkering agents in their hands for the time being. Mr. Douglas has, / otv. onx!/however, given/undertaking that, in nominating these Agents, the W.S.A. willhave regard to the 50-50 basis of the British proposal; he also said that a more satisfactory procedure would be reached later.
