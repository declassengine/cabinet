WAR CABINET.GOVERNMENT BUILDING PROGRAMME.ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF BUILDING LABOUR FOR THEREMAINDER OF THE PERIOD ENDING 30th SEPTEMBER,1943.Memorandum by the Minister of Production.1. At their meeting on the 3rd June* the War Cabinet defended a decision as to how certain additional requirements for building labour should be met.2. The Lord Presidents Committee has now approved in principle theproposals of the Minister of Works for securing the closer co-ordination and direction of the Building Programme as a whole. Arrangements to give effectto this decision are under discussion with the Departments, and, as a first result,an immediate examination is being made of the position of each Departmentsconstructional works and the labour position.3. It is not possible to express in any exact form the advantage which willbe gained by these measures, more particularly in the immediate future. It must,however, be emphasised that these represent the only means at our disposal foradding to our resources for carrying out the Government building programme for the next few months. Under the War Cabinet decision of the 3rd June the call-up of building workers other than the 18 year olds is being deferred untilthe end of September for the benefit of the Air Ministry programme, and I amunable to recommend any further cuts in other parts of the Government building programme, either service or civilian departments, in order to meet additional requirements. At the same time the building workers not already employed onthe Government building programme are for the most part immobile and not,therefore, available for most of the new Government works, while the labour left for maintenance work is certainly in some places at or below the safety levelrequired for the essential repair of houses, factories, &amp;c, and the repair - Ofdamaged houses. Nevertheless, the maintenance labour force employed both on government and other work is being closely examined to see if any men can be released.4.   Additional requirements have been notified to me as follows : (a) A ir Ministry.Under the decision of the War Cabinet on the 3rd June, the labour force for the Air Ministry building programme &quot;would remain at about 90,000for the period July, August and September.&quot; The Secretary of State forAir has now represented to me that even with the labour force of 101,000 forwhich he had previously asked there would be a shortage of accommodation at the end of September for 140 American aircraft and 64 British aircraft.This forecast appears to take no account of any possible benefits from themeasures referred to in paragraph 2 above.* W.M.

(b) War Office.The Secretary of State for War mentioned0 in the War cabinet discussion on the 3rd June that it might be necessary to begin work at once on  additional depots for use by the United States Forces. I have now beeninformed on his behalf that one of these is to be built with United Stateslabour, but that work on the remaining three must be begun at once and. requires an additional labour force rising to 5,000 from August to October.The War Office proposal is that the labour required for work on these threedepots after October should be supplied by the United States Forces. Thesedepots are required to be capable of being operated by the 31st December,1943, in order to handle supplies expected under the current shippingprogramme.5. For the reasons given in paragraph 3 above, I am unable to make any specific suggestions for additions to the labour forces already approved for theAir Ministry and War Office in order to meet these requirements.(a) Air Ministry.I ask the War Cabinet, however, to endorse the proposal that, so far asthe measures already approved enable the Air Ministry labour force to bemaintained at a higher level than 90,000 without encroaching on the require-&apos; ments of other programmes, this should be done. (It is already almost certainthat it will amount to over 95,000 throughout the month of June.) I alsorecommend that every effort should be made to secure the greatest possibleadvantage from the measures referred to in paragraph 2 above and from the economies in standards of hutting accommodation approved by the WarCabinet on the 3rd June.*(b) War Office.I recommend that every effort should be made in the case of the WarOffice programme, as in the. case of the Air Ministry, to secure the greatestmeasure of advantage from the measures referred to in paragraph 2 above.The possibility should also be explored of diverting to the three depots inquestion labour that would otherwise be employed on works required to becompleted for the United States forces in April and May, 1944. the americans should then be asked to provide additional labour for these works,when their personnel becomes available during the autumn and winter months, to compensate for the British labour employed on the depots duringthe summer. As an immediate measure I recommend that work on thesedepots should be begun, without any specific addition to the War Officelabour quota, and that every effort should be made to make the necessary labour available for them without encroachment on other parts of theGovernment programme.Building Programme for the United States Forces.6. At the meeting of the War Cabinet on the 19th Mayt I was asked toprepare a statement in a form suitable for communication to the United StatesGovernment showing the urgent importance of relieving the strain on our build-ing resources by securing the agreement of the United States authorities (a) to accepting lower standards of accommodation for their troops, and(b) to undertaking a larger proportion of the building work required fortheir forces by United. States military labour.&apos; &apos;As a result of subsequent discussions the United States authorities havealready agreed that their forces shall, if necessary, accept British standards of personnel accommodation. Further, so far as ground force requirements areconcerned, they have agreed to provide the labour for any additional works whichthey may require, not already included in the programme of works for construc-tion by British labour, except that, as explained in paragraph 4 (b) above, theywill not be able to provide labour for three of the four depots there mentioneduntil after October. Work for the United States Air Force which we are already committed to undertaking by British labour, is covered by the Air Ministryprogramme referred to in paragraphs 4 (a) and 5 (a) above. The United states authorities have suggested in discussion at various times that we might also provide the labour for extensions to 8 fighter stations and for construction of* W.M.

accommodation for additional United States personnel required on account of anincrease in the establishment of the 8th Air Force. These requirements would,need an extra labour force of about 5,000 and 12,000 men respectively for anumber of months, and I have told Mr. Philip Reed informally that it seems unlikely that we can take on these additional commitments.7. The United States authorities have also stated a requirement for the rehabilitation of perimeter tracks on airfields in their occupation, the work onwhich must be done over the next three or four months. They cannot makeUnited States labour available at this early date, and the Minister of Works is. endeavouring to make arrangements for meeting this requirement in a way whichwill not prejudice the Government building programme.Ministry of Production, S.W. 1,23rd June, 1943.
