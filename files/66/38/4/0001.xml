Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.SECRET. Copy- No.W.P. (43) 264.20th June, 1943.WAR CABINET.A VISIT TO THE URALS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I think that my colleagues may be interested to read the following notes byMr. G. M. Wilson of the Foreign Office, describing a visit which he paid toSverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk in the Urals in April last, while temporarilyserving at His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Moscow.A. E.Foreign Office, 20th June, 1943.ONCE the Ambassador has persuaded M. Molotov to let me visit the Urals,I armed myself with a &quot; propusk &quot; authorising me to stay five days inSverdlovsk and two days in Chelyabinsk, and left Moscow on the evening of the1st April. I travelled by way of Gorki, Kirov and Molotov and arrived inSverdlovsk on the morning of the 5th April. I stayed in a large hotel builtabout six years ago, and was looked after by one representative from the OblastExecutive Committee and one from the Town Soviet. They were never available for midday, and insisted on taking me to the theatre on each of the fourevenings I spent in the town, but I managed to persuade them to let me see twofactories (one of them a large tank factory), the Ural Industrial Institute, anda large middle school, and to motor me along all the main roads leading out of thetown.2. I left Sverdlovsk on the 9th April and travelled eleven hours overnightto Chelyabinsk (there were only two trains a week and the next one was not duetill the 13th April). My permit allowed me to stay there forty-eight hours, butthis included a Sunday, and no arrangements had been made for me to seeanything. I asked to see the Kirov factory, which is, I believe, the largest tankfactory in the country. The request had to be referred to Moscow, and no reply had come by the time I had to leave for Kuibyshev on the 12th April. The localschools, institutes, &amp;c, and the factories, which they could show me without special permission from Moscow were shut on Sunday, so I spent my time walkingthrough the town, going to the theatre, and being driven round all the outskirtsby the young and very intelligent assistant to the Chairman of the OblastExecutive Committee. From Chelyabinsk I travelled direct to Kuibyshev, viaZlatoust and Ufa, in forty-eight hours.3. It was very obvious that an Englishman, or, indeed, a foreigner of any kind, was a great rarity in these parts. At schools and institutes the entirestaff paraded, and visits to factories were made under the personal supervision of the manager, the party secretary, the trade union organiser, and a bevy ofsoldiers. At hotels I was given what was rather euphemistically described asthe luxury suite, and the chefs seemed to have been given carte blanche to spreadthemselves as much as they liked. At Chelyabinsk the hotel manager refusedto let me pay my bill and had a chocolate cake specially made for me to take inthe train. All the people I talked to in towns and trains, including severalofficers and a good many members of the Communist Party, were quite over-overwhelmingly friendly, and very interested in anything they could learn about GreatBritain.12062   [25600]
4. The second front was scarcely mentioned and even then in a curiouslyapologetic way, but everybody without exception asked when the war was goingto end and said that it must be soon. They constantly referred to the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement about the war going on till 1944 or 1945, and asked why he said it and whether he really meant it. The people I met at the hotel inChelyabinsk were probably fairly typical of the emerging middle-class andtheir experiences show how they have been affected by the war and why theyare so anxious for it to end.5. The assistant to the Chairman of the Obiast Executive Committee wasa Ukrainian of 33 who had been trained as an electrical engineer at Leningrad.After he qualified, he and the three other star students of his year hadbeen sent on a six months&apos; tour to Germany, Italy and Switzerland, and there-after he had worked in Moscow, Bessarabia, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Siberia,the Far East, and finally Stalingrad, where he superintended the evacuation ofmachinery. His father, a pre-revolution engineer, had gone back to work again at the age of 70. He disliked Chelyabinsk intensely, especially as his wife and family were still in Moscow, and he was working from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. and from p.m. to 4 a.m. six days a week and had only had five days off since the warbegan.6. The manager of the hotel come from Moscow. He was about 27, and,until a few months ago, was working in a factory. It seems that he wassuddenly fished out and put in charge of this large hotel and also of all the hair-dressing establishments in the town; He had nothing to complain of personally,apart from long hours, and told me that his young brother, who was workingwith British tanks on the Central Front, had recently written to say that thesetanks were a material proof of British friendship for Russia.7. The assistant manager was a middle-aged Jewess from Kiev. Beforethe war she had been manager of a clothing factory at Kharkov employing 5,000people. &apos;She evacuated with the factory to Kuibyshev, and later came to join her husband in Chelyabinsk and got a job at the hotel.8. The manager of the restaurant, who also came from Moscow, was ayoungish man who had spent a good deal of time at the front, catering for thearmy. He talked in a very matter-of-fact way about German atrocities in thereoccupied areas, and his listeners seemed to take it all very much for granted asbeing the sort of thing one would expect from Germans.9. The assistant manager of the restaurant was about the only native of theUrals that I met. Her husband was with the army when the war started and she had not seen him since or heard of him for seven months.10. The chef was from Leningrad, where he had trained for seven years before the revolution under a French chef. He had also worked in England, andwas justifiably proud of his skill. His only son had died of starvation inLeningrad last winter.11. Most of these people had also had relatives killed or missing, and they all looked back to the pre-war days as a time when life was, good and- gettingbetter. I do not believe the possibility had ever entered their heads of giving upfighting until the Germans were defeated, but the complete upheaval in their lives,and the general strain and tension in which they were living, made them feel thatthings could not go on like this indefinitely. There was ho defeatism or feeling of despair, but rather a desperate determination to defeat the Germans quickly.12. There was a universal and quite obviously genuine enthusiasm for Anglo-Soviet-American collaboration now and after the war, based largely, Ithink, on a longing to be free from the sense of isolation which has been drilledinto them for so many years. Their only doubt about such collaboration was whether they could trust us and the Americans to play the game. Munich hassunk in very deep and was constantly referred to it will take time for the,suspicions arising from it to be dispelled entirely.13. Poland was clearly another stumbling block. The general consensus ofopinion was that the Poles talked too much and did too little, and that, as theyoperated from British territory, presumably they had our approval for anythingthey did. There was clearly no love for the Japanese and, in their more expansivemoments, my companions had no hesitation in classing them with the Germans.
14. They were surprisingly well-informed, about the exploits of the8th Army and were full of praisfe for our raids on Germany. Their respect and admiration for the Prime Minister seemed to be second only to that for Stalin.In view of Admiral Standley&apos;s recent remarks, it was interesting to notice how many people pulled bits of fat and bacon out of their pockets with the remarkthat it was American.15. British rationing was another matter of universal interest, and theregularity of the question: &quot;Is there enough food in England?&quot; betrayed agood deal of anxiety about their own position. They were rather taken aback to learn that bread was not rationed and quite nonplussed to hear that there was nofree market where the rich could buy things over and above their rations.16. Industrial expansion in the Urals is still being pushed forward rapidly,and in Sverdlovsk and Chelyabinsk, as well as in most of the towns I passed through in the train, new factories are being built and. existing/ones extended. this seems to be being done, no doubt deliberately, at the expense of domestic housing,and much of the old housing, as well as the billets specially put up for evacuatedworkers, looked perfectly appalling. The war has, of course, enormouslyexaggerated the good and bad aspects of this development, and though such people as I asked were very shy about giving figures, I was told by someone whowas in a position to know that the floor space per person in Chelyabinsk had beenreduced from the pre-war figure of 12 square metres to 3^ square metres at thepresent time (this may be compared with 4-^ square metres in Moscow before thewar) and that there was no intention of repatriating factories unless there were good local reasons for doing so. If the development of this area goes forward atanything like its present rate, the volume and variety of its productive capacitywill be immense. But it is to be hoped that, at some fairly early stage, the emphasis will be shifted from pure production&apos; to the provision of adequatehousing, streets and communications.17. The technical skill on which this expansion is based is largely providedby the Ural Industrial Institute at Sverdlovsk, where I spent three hours. It has4,500 full-time students, 3,000 of whom live on the premises, 1,000 students takingcorrespondence courses (3,000 before the war), and a large number of eveningstudents, most of whom come from the large Uralmashzavod, just outside the town.There isa faculty of 400, and the courses that can be taken are heavy engineering,light engineering, chemistry, electrical engineering and power, building,mechanical engineering, and engineering economics. The course is five years, and before the war the students, who are selected by examination from the top formof the middle schools, came mainly from the Urals.18. The fees are 300 roubles per annum, plus .10 roubles per month for accommodation and 85 roubles per month for food. Before the war,70 per cent, of the students paid full fees, but now 50 per cent, areexempt from the 300 roubles per annnum on the grounds that they are orphans,or that one or both of their parents are at the front or because they have been givenscholarships. Two foreign languages are compulsory and are studied for four hours a week; 65 per cent, of the students are now learning English. The director,the chemistry professor and the librarian protested, strongly about the. absence ofBritish technical journals, and I told them that I would see what could be done.Certainly, the provision of such journals in generous quantities would be a goodinvestment with a view to post-war trade, quite apart from other reasons.19. I was taken over the electrical and building departments, and the library and reading rooms. The latter were packed with people studying,including a large number of officers and privates, and the atmosphere of coricen-tration was terrific. The students do their practical training in actual productionin the local factories which, as often as not, ask if they can have the student backafter he has qualified. .        ..20. I believe that this institute is the largest of its kind in the Soviet Union(there are, of course, dozens of smaller ones) and it alone is turning out yearly900 highly-trained engineers. It is only to a comparatively small extent thatthese people are replacements for engineers who are retiring from industry. Allthe senior technical personnel that I met were men in their late thirties or earlyforties, i.e., men who had lived all their adult lives under the Soviet system andwho had another twenty years&apos; work in them. By far the greater part of thenew recruits, therefore, represent an absolute gain in. the number of techniciansavailable, and this rapidly expanding reservoir.of technical skill should do much[25600] . b 2
to remove some of the more serious difficulties with which Soviet industry hasbeen faced.21. It rather seems that in the U.S.S.R. an engineering education now takes the place which a classical education took in Great Britain thirty years ago.All the younger officials in the People&apos;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, of whose backgrounds I know anything, were trained as engineers, and the same istrue of all the administrative personnel that I met in the Urals. At two schoolsI was told that there was not a single pupil in the higher forms who intended totake an arts course at the university-all of them were going to do science orengineering of some kind. One of the effects of this concentration must be to accelerate yet more rapidly the material development of the country.22. The extent of the war propaganda has to be seen to be believed.Factories, institutes, schools, hotels, stations and streets are plastered withslogans, exhortations and extracts from the sayings of the great. All the threeplays (as distinct from operas and operettas) which I saw in Sverdlovsk andChelyabinsk were straight propaganda. One was an exhortation to soldiers&apos; wivesto remain faithful while their husbands were away and not to give up hope thatthey would return home. The other two were variations on the story of NadezhdaDurova, the girl who dressed up as a man and joined the army in 1812, wasdecorated for bravery by Kutuzov, and so proved that women could play their part at the front as effectively as men.23. At a school in Sverdlovsk I was allowed to sit in on a history lesson forthe 5th class (12-year-olds). The subject was the graeco-Persian wars, whichwere recounted factually enough, and the teacher then asked why the Greeks had won. The right answer, which the children arrived at on their own in fairlyquick time, was that the Greeks were defending their native land and their cultureagainst an alien aggressor, and that, apart from the slave class (which was a badthing), they had a democratic form of government. Democracy was defined as ruleby the people. A girl who volunteered that the &quot; demos &quot; was the poor peasantsgot a very rough passage.24. Most people commented, always favourably, on Britansky Soyuznik.Apart from the copies in my room at the hotel (from which I should hesitate todraw any conclusions), I saw it being read in the reading-room of the Red ArmyHouse in Sverdlovsk, and a copy was also being read in one of the theatres. as there are only 20,000 copies in circulation, this seemed fairly good going.25. The only specific complaint that I heard about shortage of food was froma soldier in the train between Kirov and Molotov, who said that in his village,about 30 miles west of Molotov, there was practically nothing except bread, andnot much of that; but that at the front they got all they wanted in the way offood, tobacco and drink. Some of the towns, particularly Chelyabinsk andZlatoust, gave every appearance of being short, but people whom I asked said,without much enthusiasm, that it was all right. In a factory canteen atSverdlovsk they showed me the menu, which had on it soup, omelette, sausage,pancakes, bread and tea with sugar. It looked pretty meagre to me, but themanagement did not seem to think there was anything to worry about, and nocoupons were surrendered for meals taken in the canteen. I made persistentefforts to eat in the public restaurant at the hotels, but entirely without success,and it was really quite impossible to get any clear idearof what the position was.26. Certainly, there was plenty to be bought from peasant women at mostof the innumerable villages where the train stopped milk at an average price of40 roubles a litre, eggs 10 roubles apiece, butter anything from 400 to. 800 roublesa kilog., an occasional chicken at 400 roubles or thereabouts, potatoes at 25 roublesa kilog., and, at a few stations, onions at about 60 roubles a kilog. Enormousquantities of goods changed hands even at these prices, but there was very considerably more on the southern route from Chelyabinsk to Kuibyshev than onthe northern route from Gorki to Sverdlovsk. The corresponding prices for these goods on the free markets in Moscow and Kuibyshev are : Moscow - KuibyshevRoubles. Roubles.Milk...     &apos;..........        80 50Eggs......    .........        25 15Butter..........    1,000 700Potatoes     .........       85 60Onions     ..........      200 100
27. The large variations in price between town and country seem to showthat at any rate a considerable part of the food shortage in towns such as Moscowis due to transport difficulties, and. may well mean that towns with a good agricultural hinterland are not being hit unduly hard.28. One of the more surprising sights is the number of people travelling onthe railways. Men and women cluster on the roofs of the carriages, sit on thebuffers and hang on the steps with all their household goods. As the trains rarelygo more than 25 miles an hour and can be relied on to stop for at least 20 minutes -in each hour, this procedure is not as dangerous^ as it might appear, but it mustbe very exhausting. As trains approach Moscow, where nobody is supposed togo without special written authorisation, the militia at the stations make noisyand excited attempts to turn the outside passengers off, while the inside passengersmake clucking noises of sympathy. But they are all back there when the trainstarts moving. There is certainly a big influx into Moscow of people who wereevacuated, and in Sverdlovsk I was told that it was impossible to estimate thepopulation because so many evacuees had left. But trains going east from moscow and from Gorki were in the same condition, and one can only assume that the mobilisation of labour is far less efficient and complete than is often supposed.29. Nor does the transfer of factories and, machinery seem to be anything like complete. I saw very many trains carrying lathes and other machinery,often with several trucks of beds and chairs, and other trucks carrying women.It looked as though factories were being moved complete with labour; Some ofthe trains seemed to be heading east, some west. There may have been a planbehind it all, but it was certainly not obvious-nor can it have been any part ofthe plan that the machinery should be quite so rusty, or that the trains should stand in stations quite so long as many of them appeared to have done.30. Yet even here there is, I think, a certain system. There are only two categories of priority in Russia things that matter desperately, and things thatdo not matter at all, at any rate for the time being. The thing that matters now is war production and the provision of new productive capacity, and anything that does not directly serve this purpose is allowed to slide. It may get done or it may not hence the neglect of housing, non-essential machinery, sanitation,streets, useless mouths, &amp;c. This policy is applied quite ruthlessly and accounts,I think, for much of the chaos and confusion which is part of the high price whichhas been, and is still being, paid for the forced industrialisation of the country.It is only as technical and administrative personnel becomes available in adequatequantities that any marked improvement in this respect can be expected.31.
