Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECRET.Copy&apos; No.W.P. (43) 294.5th July, 1943.aWAR CABINETMORALE AND THE WAR AGAINST JAPAN.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.THE Memorandum submitted by the Secretary of State for India(W.P. (43) 232) provides an opportunity to put forward certain important considerations concerning the probable continuation of the war against Japanafter the defeat of Germany and Italy, as it affects the Royal Navy. memoranda on this subject have been put forward by the Secretary of State for War, theSecretary of State for Air, the Minister without Portfolio and the Minister forInformation, and I agree generally with the views expressed by my colleagues asto the need for careful education of opinion and, in particular of Service opinion,on the need to defeat Japan, for- the purpose of maintaining morale.2. The issues affecting the fighting Services fall under two main heads :(a) Demobilisation, and (b) Pay and Family and Dependants&apos; Allowances.3. The questions arising under (a) Demobilisation are firstly those connectedwith early return to civil life, and, secondly, the conditions of re-entry into civil employment.4. It must be taken for granted that no very large reduction in the numbersof Naval&apos;personnel will be possible until Japan has been defeated. In fact, itmay safely be assumed that a large intake into the Royal Navy will be necessary,probably right up to the end of hostilities. For this reason it is presumed thatihe conscription of man-power into the Royal Navy will need to continue in orderto avoid retaining over a prolonged period men whose age and length of war servicegive them a high priority for demobilisation under the scheme approved by HisMajesty&apos;s Government. Indeed, if a similar proportion of men of comparableage and service is not demobilised from the Royal Navy pari passu with releases from the Army and the Royal Air Force, a serious cause of discontent is likelyto arise both in the minds of the men and of their families. I therefore considerit essential that an announcement at the appropriate moment should be made ofthe Governments views on the general principles governing demobilisation andespecially on the prospects of release before the end of the final struggle for thosewho have been all through the war.5. A similar announcement of the Governments intention regardingconditions of re-entry into civil employment would also be of the utmost value.There is wide-spread apprehension throughout the service that early demobilisa-tion will mean the chance of a job, and that prolonged service may lead to unemployment. I appreciate that this subject is likely to be a thorny and difficult one. But it will have to be faced if the fighting morale and peace of mind ofthose who will be required to continue the fight are to be maintained after ameasure of demobilisation has commenced and the threat to their homes has been removed to a distance some 10,000 miles from these shores.6. The question of Pay and Family and Dependants&apos; Allowances seems certain to arise in an acute form, when men are feeling the strain of long serviceand the reaction from victory over Germany and Italy. Comparisons with ratesof remuneration in industry at home have frequently been drawn, and alreadythere is much comment on the differences between the pay of our forces and thatof the Dominions and the American forces.   At that stage the war will become.[25694]
in the words of the Prime Minister on the 22nd March, 1943, &quot; to punish thegreedy, cruel Empire of Japan, to rescue China from her long torment, to freeour own territory and that of our Dutch allies, and to drive the Japanese menaceforever from Australian, New Zealand and Indian shores.&quot;7. There is a danger that the men may ask why they are having to carryon the fight for the benefit of others for the Americans, for example, who came into the war late and whose special interest has been shown to lie in the Pacific at a rate of pay far lower than that of those who are so vitally involved, and why their families at home are to. continue in comparative impoverishment. Theywill also be dissatisfied if they feel that they and their families are placed ata disadvantage compared with those engaged in industry in this country.8. This is not a subject on which rapid conclusions are likely to be attainablenor one on which it would be possible, or even desirable, to make an early publicpronouncement. It is most necessary, however, that investigation into thisquestion should commence at an early date so that we may have plans ready whichcan be produced at the right moment, when they will be required to smooth overthe awkward transitional period when the main emphasis of Naval war has tobe transferred to the other side of the globe.9. The Admiralty are of the opinion that the maintenance of that fightingspirit which will be essential to the early defeat of Japan may in a large measuredepend upon His Majesty&apos;s Government being able, at the appropriate moment,to give assurances on the following lines : (a) That our Forces engaged in carrying on the war against Japan will not themselves, or their families and dependants, be at a serious dis-advantage as compared with those in industry or with the Dominions: and Allied troops from the countries most nearly concerned with the* Pacific.(b) That wTe intend to retain powers of conscription and apply them to the younger age groups during the period between the defeat of Germanyand Italy and that of Japan.(c) That every effort will be made to absorb into employment those who aredemobilised late. It is recognised that the measures required to enablesuch an assurance to be given will need most careful consideration.10. I agree with the suggestion of the Minister without Portfolio in the last paragraph of his Memorandum W.P. (43) 241, that the Chiefs of Staff shouldbe asked as a preliminary to estimate the man-power requirements involved incarrying on the war against Japan.A. V. A.&apos;Admiralty, S.W.1,5th July, 1943.
