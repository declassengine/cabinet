Printed for the War Cabinet,   June 1943.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (43) 275.28th June, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.FOOD CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate herewith to my colleagues a Report^) by the ParliamentaryLlnder-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the results of the Food Confer-ence recently held at Hot Springs. The Resolutions of the Conference havealready been published as a White Paper.(2) I think it will be agreed that the outcome of this Conference has been highly satisfactory, and that this is largely due to the excellent work of the United Kingdom Delegation.The most important Resolution passed by the Conference is resolution no. II. This recommends that an Interim Commission should be established in washington with instructions in particular to draw up for submission to Govern-ments the constitution of a Permanent Organisation in the field of food and agriculture. In the drafting of the constitution of the Permanent organisation  number of difficult points will have to be dealt with. It will therefore be ofgreat importance that our representative on the Interim Commission should be fully instructed on all these points. A Committee of officials is alreadyconsidering how these instructions should be framed, and I propose that whenthey have done their work the draft instructions should be submitted to theLord President in the first instance.The United Kingdom Delegation played a leading part at the Conference.It would be appropriate therefore that the United Kingdom Government should express at an early date its acceptance of the Conference Resolutions, if possible without reservation. Moreover, there are certain Resolutions which it is greatly to our interest that other countries should fully carry out. In particular,Resolution XII, dealing with changes in production in, the short-term period, is-one which we should like to see the United States and other overseas producerstake literally and act upon with all possible speed since only in this way can the prospective shortages of supplies, both for the United Kingdom and for reliefpurposes, be mitigated. At the same time it should be borne in mind thatthe Resolutions were drawn up by representatives of 44 nations and coveraction to be taken in a number of different circumstances; some of these nations have predominantly a producer interest, others mainly a consumer interest, some are temporarily occupied by the enemy and therefore unable immediately to take effective action, on the Resolutions. It, would be appropriate therefore for us tomake it clear in accepting the Resolutions that readiness to take action upon them must be governed for all countries, including our own, by their applicabilityin individual cases. In this way we should avoid future criticism for failing tocarry out some particular Resolution designed to meet conditions which do&quot; not obtain here.I have undertaken to make a statement in the House within the next fewdays.   I should like on that occasion to announce the Government&apos;s acceptance(l) Appendix.(a) Cmd. 6451.[25627]b
of the Conference Resolutions, and would propose to make the announcement on the following lines : His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom notewith pleasure the agreement reached at the International Conference on food and Agriculture. While recognising that the Resolutions were drawn up by representatives of 44 countries with widely differing physical, political andeconomic conditions and that their application will depend on these differences,His Majesty&apos;s Government for their part have no hesitation in accepting theResolutions and the obligation to give effect to them in so far as they apply to conditions in the United Kingdom. His Majesty&apos;s Government will also beprepared to co-operate fully with other Governments in seeking ways to give effectto those Resolutions which call for concerted action. They will commend theResolutions to the Governments of the Colonies, Dependencies and overseas territories. They are anxious to take their full part in the work of the interim commission to be set up in Washington. They note with satisfaction that oneof the tasks of this Commission will be to draw up a formal Declaration or agreement for the consideration of governments; in this instrument the govern-ments would recognise their obligation to their respective peoples and to one another to collaborate in raising levels of nutrition and standards of living oftheir peoples and to report to one another on the progress made. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment also note with&apos; satisfaction that, while the Conference was not concerned with the organisation of relief supplies, due attention was paid to thenecessity for increasing supplies of basic foodstuffs in advance of and during theperiod when territories liberated from the enemy will be in need of help from outside. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are determined toplay their part to the full in giving effect to the Resolutions of the Conference onthis subject and they earnestly hope that other governments will do likewise.I ask my colleagues for authorisation to proceed accordingly.A. E.APPENDIX.Mr. Law&apos;s Report on the Food Conference.THE Hot Springs Conference assembled in an atmosphere which wascompounded, in about equal parts, of resentment, suspicion and ridicule. when we arrived in Washington the public was indifferent and sceptical. The pressdisplayed hostility and irritation. Congress had joined the newspapers indemanding a withdrawal of the ban on outside attendance at the meetings and free access to the delegates at the Conference. The Administration had failedaltogether to pacify the press with their explanations of the motives and purposeof the Conference, and had only partially succeeded in pacifying Congress. after our return from Hot Springs, I was asked to meet the Foreign Affairs Committeeof the Senate. I was pressed very hard on the subject of the Conference, andsome, at least, of the Committee seemed to be genuinely surprised by my assurance that their Government had not, in fact, entered into any far-reaching commitmentsat Hot Springs.Official observers, if they did not share the full scepticism of the public, were clearly nervous and uneasy about the prospects. It - was&apos; suggested, with thatslightly malicious frankness which is characteristic of American officials, that thePresident, having summoned the Conference and having scented failure from afar,was preparing to climb out from underneath it. As the various delegationsarrived in Washington the lack of preparation became very evident, particularlyin those missions which had come from distant parts. The State Departmentitself had prepared some admirable papers, but the American delegation wasill-assorted and ill-prepared. All in all the, outlook was bleak, and it did not seempossible that forty-four nations with equal voting rights, with no very precisedirection and no agreed machinery of management, and. with altogetherinadequate preparation, could achieve anything except abject failure.After we had been in Washington for some days I suggested to the state department that it might help to create a better atmosphere if we explained tothe press that, whatever anyone else might feel, we ourselves attached the greatest importance to the Conference. Accordingly, we held a widely attended press conference in Washington, and from then on the United Kingdom delegation(under the guidance, which was altogether beyond praise., of Mr. W. J. Hinton
and Mr. C. H. Campbell of the British Information Services) served as a kindof lightning conductor. We had a further press conference at Hot Springs andthere were numerous informal talks between representatives of the press and various members of the delegation. There was also a quite admirable statementof policy which had been drafted by the delegation on the way over, which,masquerading as an undelivered speech of my own, was issued to the press afew days after the Conference had opened.All of this had an excellent effect upon the attitude of the press, both towards our own delegation and towards the work of the Conference as a whole. Therewere some embarrassing moments, since our attitude was constantly beingcompared to that of the Administration. But we were careful not to overdo it,and as the Conference proceeded we withdrew more and more into the back-ground. In any case, the Americans were more grateful than resentful; and asthe attitude of the Press towards the Conference improved the United states representatives also became more at ease.The Conference set to work on the 18th May in that atmosphere of fog-boundchaos to which we had become,accustomed. Within a few days, however, the foghad begun to lift and anarchy gave way to something like order. This change was due, in the main, to the activities of the United Kingdom Delegation and ofthe American Secretariat-General of the Conference. In marked contrast to theUnited States Delegation, which seemed to have been picked haphazard fromthe highways and byways of politics, the &apos; Secretariat-General was a body of highly competent officials from the State Department. The Conference at onceaccepted the procedure which they had evolved. There were to be no statements of policy at the opening session. Almost the first act of the Conference was toagree to a closing date, a most valuable innovation which at once set a limit tothe possibilities of digression and made every delegation conscious of the need to get business done. There was to be one official language English.. Thisprovoked a characteristic protest from the French, who demanded that french should be adopted, in accordance with the precedents, as a second official language..The proposition was turned down by the Conference. It was, however, only thefirst of a series of clumsy and childish manoeuvres designed to assert the rightsof France as a Great Power. These tactics failed in all respects save one : theysucceeded in irritating the Americans to the point of frenzy.The work of the United Kingdom Delegation was incomparable. I suppose that we have never sent an abler delegation to any international conference : this,certainly, was the general opinion at Hot Springs, where there were gathered aconsiderable number of old oonference hacks. The work of the delegation wasconditioned by the fact that the United States Delegation had no policy andwould have been unable, I think, to give much of a lead even if it had had one.With the notable exception of the Australians, few delegations, apart from ourown, arrived with any clear ideas. The result was that the United kingdom delegation took complete control of the Conference. There was no field in whichthe British champion, whoever he may have been, did not easily outmatch all-comers. In every committee it was the British delegates who steered the business to its conclusion.- At the same time there was so much tact, and so much restraint on the part of our delegation that the Conference as a whole, while it recognisedour lead, welcomed rather than resented it.Senor Muniz, the unforgettable, enchanting and infinitely comic head of the brazilian delegation informed me that &quot; England had been reborn.&quot; On anotheroccasion, when I had been having some minor disagreement with Judge Jones,the American chairman of the Conference, the Secretary-General, an. extremelycompetent State Department official, followed me out of the room, and with tearsin his voice if not in his eyes, poured out his heart to me. &quot; You see for yourself,&quot;he said, &quot;an example of what I have had to put up with, day in and day out.Can. you not find time, when you get back to Washington, to impress uponMr. Welles and the Secretary the fact that they cannot afford, if they mean tomake a success of the peace, to send again a delegation of this kind to an inter-national conference? They know, as well as you or I, that if it had not been for the British the Hot Springs Conference would have been an unmitigateddisaster.&quot;We were a numerous delegation. At one time our total staff at Hot Springs,,including typists and cypher officers, reached nearly fifty. Not one of these wasredundant, and it was an immense advantage to the delegation to be able to count upon the services of an adequate staff. I very much hope that at any futureconferences the British delegation may be equally well served. There is one further observation that I should like to make now for future consideration. The[25627], - B2
Russian delegation at Hot Springs were a strong and businesslike team, but theywere always a doubtful factor because the heads of the delegation spoke noEnglish. They had their own interpreters, but it was never possible for anymember of the British delegation who knew our own views and policy to talkdirectly with the Russians. During the last few days of the Conference, Mr. JohnRussell joined us from the Embassy in Washington, and he was of the greatestassistance to us at some ticklish moments. If he had been with us throughout,and if he had been fully briefed, his services would have been of even greatervalue. I hope, therefore, that it may be possible in any future conference, toinclude in the United Kingdom delegation someone who is able to get on terms with the Russians without the aid of an interpreter. The same considerations apply though in lesser degree, to the South American countries.The attitude of the Soviet delegation at the Conference was most remark-able. In the early days they ran true to form. When I asked M. Krutikov, the leader of the Soviet delegation, what he expected to come out of the Conference,he replied &quot;Nothing.&quot; When I asked for the reasons for his pessimism, hereplied that the Soviet Union had solved all problems of production anddistribution alike. When I observed that in that case we should undoubtedly beable to benefit greatly from their experience, M. Krutikov said that the soviet union was interested only in the war against Hitlerite Germany and had made no preparations for discussions of this kind. This attitude was exactly whatwas to be expected. It was all the more surprising, therefore, when it wasmodified.Half-way through the conference the Soviet delegation began to follow theproceedings with closer attention. They would intervene from time to time, butalways in order to help. If ever two other delegations appeared to have reachedan impasse the Soviet delegate would leap to his feet with some, suggestion forcompromise, or to support the less unreasonable of the two views which had been expressed. There was a crisis at the end of the Conference when it looked as though the Russians were suddenly reverting to type : but it became clear, on examination, that they were the victims of a genuine misunderstanding, andthey were ready enough to reach agreement after it had been cleared up.Although the speech of their chairman at the final session may be read with considerable satisfaction, they did not make any very notable contributions tothe work of the Conference : they were hardly in a position to do so since theyhad clearly come quite unprepared. But they did assume the unfamiliar role ofa kind of international boy scout, doing his daily good turn with great satisfaction to himself and relatively little irritation to his elders. It would be gratifyingto think that this change of heart on the part of the Russians was due to theinfluence of the United Kingdom Delegation (we worked very hard on them); butit is more encouraging to believe that it was connected in some way with theabolition of the Comintern, of which we had the news midway through theConference.Of the other delegations I was greatly impressed by the Chinese. They wereintelligent, friendly and obliging. I had expected that they would tend to appearas the proteges or the clients of the Americans, but they were perfectly inde-pendent and quite sure of themselves. And I was assured by those best qualified to judge that the degree of technical competence in the Chinese delegation wasvery high indeed.The work of the Conference has been dealt with in other papers but there areone or two reflexions which I would like to offer upon it. In the light of our instructions and in view of the susceptibilities of our. European allies it wasnecessary that we should persuade the Conference to pay some attention to theneeds of the immediate post-war period. The Americans, however, were jealousfor the position of Mr. Lehman and the Relief Organisation and were mostunwilling to inject into&apos;the Conference any consideration of matters which had a bearing upon Relief. It was possible to overcome this prejudice, and theConference agreed not only that the immediate post-war period was an integral part of the problem as a whole, but also that during this period it would be essential to preserve the principle of co-ordination of supplies and allocations.According to our instructions we were to agree to a continuation of rationing of food-stuffs after the war, but we were not to volunteer any declaration on thesubject. This issue did not arise in any very clear form. The Senior member ofthe United States delegation, however, announced at a press conference that theAmerican people would have to submit to rationing for an indefinite period after. the war. This statement was widely quoted, but it provoked surprisingly littlecomment.
Before the Conference opened there was some apprehension lest the americans might develop the tactics of the Wheat Conference in order to restrictproduction in non-producer countries for the benefit of producer countries. Thesefears were groundless, and all the emphasis was on diversification rather thanrestriction of production : I think that nothing was done at Hot Springs to cause the least uneasiness to the Minister of Agriculture. The Agricultural Resolu-tions were concrete and helpful, pointing the way to a United Nations policywhich would deal with the shortage period after the war, with the avoidance of surpluses after that period, and finally with the situation when these fmctua-.tions cease. In putting forward this programme the United Kingdom Delegationreceived strong support from a large number of European Delegations and others,including Australia and Canada. There were some indications, too, before theConference opened, that the Americans might press for some kind of differentialprice system, for the benefit of the United States producer and the Asiaticconsumer.   This nightmare did not materialise.The greatest threat to Our peace of mind at Hot Springs was the danger that the Conference might become altogether commodity-minded. The considera-tion of specific commodities was ruled out ,by the Agenda. It was clear,nevertheless, that many of the delegations had come to Hot Springs with littleidea other than to peddle their own wares. They were brought to heel, however,to a very remarkable extent. This was largely due, I think, to the remarkableskill with which Professor Bobbins deployed the principles of the commoditites planwithout giving any indication that such a plan existed. Professor Robbins (ina manner delightfully unprofessorial) developed his thesis as if his ideas were asfresh to him as they were to his audience or, at most, as if he had thought ofthem in his bath that very morning. His technique was highly, successful. Itwould be too much to say that the Conference swallowed commoditites hook, line andsinker. But the reception of the underlying principles of the plan was verysympathetic.   They were well received, too, in the American press.One of our main objectives at Hot Springs was to inject into the skulls(some of them very thick) of our fellow-delegates the idea that the interestsof the producer would be best served not by restricted production at high prices,but by developing the purchasing power of the consumer, so that he could digesta greatly increased production to relate agricultural problems in other words,to the wider economic problems of currency control, commercial policy and investment. It was necessary to achieve this end, however, without leading theConference into another fallacy, the idea that an International Food Organisa-tion should be the supreme world economic authority. Mr. John Maud, who waschairman of the committee of the Conference which dealt with the relation ofnational and international economic policies to agricultural problems, skilfullyguided his flock into the appropriate fold.The machinery to be constituted for carrying forward the work of theConference was another headache. There was a constant pull between those whowanted the permanent organisation to be little more than a statistical bureauand those who saw the International Food Office as the supreme World Authorityof the future. We, for our part, tended towards the more passive conception.It was not possible, in the event, to sterilise completely the continuing organisa-tion. Nor, in my judgment, would it have been desirable to do so. Unless weare to go straight back to the anarchy of the last twenty years it will be necessaryto contemplate a series of international organisations on the technical plane,and a United Nations Office of Food and Agriculture will have to be one. Thekind of continuing organisation which is outlined in Resolution II of the FinalAct of the Conference is not passive; nor is it proposed that it should haveexecutive powers. But it was certainly intended by the Conference that itshould be active, that it should be able to ,do research work in a number of fieldsand that it should make recommendations to governments or to other organisa-tions (e.g., an investment board) which may be set up under the auspices of theUnited Nations. No doubt our representative on the Interim Commission willhave to be wide awake to ensure that the nutrition addicts and their producerallies do not take too much control. But I can see greater dangers in our beingtoo cautious than I can in our being too rash.The Hot Springs Conference is generally thought to have been a success,but it is a little difficult to define the term. When account is taken of the atmosphere in which the Conference assembled a measure of success may indeed be assumed from the fact that it did not dissolve in a welkin-shattering howl ofderision. It was certainly a pronounced diplomatic success for the UnitedKingdom Delegation: the spectacle of a British delegation to an international
conference having a positive programme of its own, which it supported with enthusiasm and imagination as well as ability and knowledge, clearly came asa shock to our colleagues at Hot Springs. But it was a pleasurable shock which made things easy for us, and enabled us to give (and the others to accept) thekind of leadership which, God willing, we always shall give to a bewildered and &apos;politically incompetent world. It may be said, too, that the Conference wasa success inasmuch as no vital British interest was put in irretrievable jeopardy.But looking back upon our experiences at Hot Springs I am inclined tothink that the most hopeful thing about the Conference was the fact that thevarious delegations, which had arrived each with its own particular axe andits own grindstone neatly packed in its suitcase, very soon put them away. the brazilian and the Colombian talked less about coffee, and the need for restrictingits production and putting up its price. The Cuban became less obsessed withsugar as the Conference proceeded. The Americans seemed to be less conscious of the farm lobby, and even the British, I think, were less haunted by the balanceof payments problem. There was a tendency, which was most marked, fordelegates to adopt a point of view somewhat wider than that which was dictated by the immediate interests of their own country. And I think that manyGovernments are likely to adopt a more sympathetic attitude towards proposalsfor international monetary arrangements&apos;, commodity control, revision of trade barriers, &amp;c, than they would have been if the Food Conference had not takenplace.Be that as it may, there are, I believe, some lessons for our future guidancewhich may profitably be drawn from the Hot Springs Conference. Mostobvious is the desirability of our sending to an international conference a delegation which is carefully selected, adequately staffed and, perhaps mostimportant of all, fully prepared- In each of these respects, we were mostadmirably served at Hot Springs.The second reflection that comes to my mind is that there are greatpossibilities in the method of procedure which was evolved by the President andwhich was expressed by the conference at Hot Springs. The Food conference had a number of characteristics which are worth thinking about. It was a con-ference of technicians. It was exploratory rather than executive. The delegates,representing their Governments, indeed, yet had no plenipotentiary powers.From these facts there seemed to flow certain consequences. The delegatesundoubtedly took a wider view of the problems under discussion than they wouldhave doile if they had been politicians, about to commit their Governments andthinking mainly of the consequences of their action upon an uninstructed publicopinion at home. Because no one felt himself to be committed irrevocably therewas a remarkably wide measure of agreement. And yet the agreement whichwas reached was far more than academic, and I have very little doubt that when we come to the stage of commitments it will be found that there is a basis ofagreement which would never have existed without the preliminary and non-committal discussions at Hot Springs.I wonder, therefore, whether it may not be possible and desirable to develop the Food Conference technique to cover other problems. It is true that food is a subject which lends itself particularly well to treatment on the technical plane.But it is not altogether true. There were latent at Hot Springs all kinds ofpolitical issues which, if they had been treated differently, might well havewrecked the Conference. There is, indeed, scarcely one of the problems withwhich we shall be faced after the war, which cannot be- considered either on thetechnical or on the political plane. It is a matter of choice. There is much to besaid for the technical approach. There is much to be said, too, for getting ageneral and &apos;&apos; non-committal&apos;&apos; agreement on the whole range of problems before we are compelled to commit ourselves finally on any of them.I do not think that we need fear that our interests will be swamped in a fullconference where they would be protected in a more limited context; or that the leadership of the Great Powers will necessarily be weakened by the principle ofone nation one vote. At Hot Springs, certainly, the leadership of the great powers was real enough. That it was acceptable was due to the fact that it didnot seem to be imposed or dictated, and that each one of the delegations felt thatthey had some influence upon it.From the point of view of ensuring American co-operation in world affairs there is no doubt that the Hot Springs method has definite advantages. There isno doubt that the Americans feel that there is safety in numbers; and I have little doubt in my own mind, after our experiences at Flot Springs, that they
are much easier to handle in a crowd than they are in bilateral discussions,and that they lean more readily in these circumstances upon our experience andjudgment. I am inclined to think, too, that the American public is less frightenedby a concrete approach to a particular problem than by general political discus-sions. They accepted food as a suitable subject for discussion because, despite itsgenerality, food is something tangible and understandable about which it seemsto them reasonable to do a deal with other countries. And at a later stage we arelikely to find that matters, such as the control of&apos; Germany or Japan and theinstitution of international policing arrangements, will be acceptable to them assubjects for discussion, not because they will be keen to participate in the politicsof international security, but because it will seem to them sensible and reasonable to keep disturbers of the peace in check in some concrete and definite way.My final reflection upon the Hot Springs Conference is this. In our dealings with the Americans we shall find it very much easier to protect British interests ifwe are able, occasionally, to forget about British interests. At an early stage ofthe Conference a senior official of the State Department, an agreeable andcultivated man who is notorious for his pro-British sympathies, came down toHot Springs for a couple of days. Just before he left I met him in the corrid )rof the hotel. He was, as a I discovered later, well primed with vodka, cockta Isand the wine of the country. He approached me and slipped his arm throu hmine. &quot; My dear fellow,&quot; he said, &quot; I hope you will be able to relax during enext ten days.&quot; I said that I hoped so too; but had he any particular form ofrelaxation in mind? &quot; We all know,&quot; he replied, &quot; that Great Britain is thegreatest country in the world. We all know that the interests of Great Britainmust come first, last and all the time. We all know that the purpose of this conference is to register the decrees of the British. But, if you would try some-times to remember that there are forty-three other nations represented here andthat some of them may have their own views, too, it would be a great help although, of course, we would never expect you to accept their views.&quot;This incident disturbed us all very much. It became clear, however, that thissurprising outburst was not related to any act of omission or commission at HotSprings; it was.rather the sudden welling-up of a long-standing irritation, theexpression of a deep feeling that in our international relationsihps we areincapable of seeing anything except our own most immediate interests. this feeling is not uncommon among Americans, however unjustifiable it may be, and unless it is countered it is difficult to get any response from them except stubborn-ness, suspicion, and sometimes an almost pathological lack of reason. There isonly one way that I know of to counter it: it is to convince them that we stand for something wider than purely British interests. Once they are convinced of that,you can be as tough as you please, but until you have convinced them toughnesswill only expose your flank.Throughout the Conference the United Kingdom Delegation was conscious that there were certain British interests which must not be abandoned and which,indeed, were in some danger. These interests were secured in the main, becauseat no stage in the Confernce did we allow it to be supposed that we were troubledabout them. I am conscious that in many quarters it&apos; is thought to be a mean andpaltry act of weakness to consider American susceptibilities. I have alwaysthought that this was a mistaken view. After my experience at Hot Springs, Iam more than ever convinced of it. Our relationship to the Americans, when allis said and done, is very much that of a father to an undergraduate son. He is afoolish father who seeks to control or guide his son by trampling upon his fondand foolish fancies.(Initialled) R, K. L.
