Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.SECRET.Cop? No./W.P. (43) 251.18th June, 1943.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR CIVILIAN AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio.THE international aspect of post-war civilian air transport was consideredby an inter-departmental Committee under the chairmanship of Sir FrancisShelmerdine, which reported in January 1942 in favour of the complete inter-nationalisation of all civilian air transport (including internal services) after thewar, under a single international organisation.2. The Committee on Reconstruction Problems referred to Lord Finlay,with Sir Orme Sargent and Sir Francis Shelmerdine as assessors, this questionof internationalisation, and in December 1942 Lord Finlay reported strongly infavour of internationalisation, under a single authority, of all air services,including internal services. Since then a Ministerial Committee assisted by officials has examined the problem, and consultations have taken place with theHigh Commissioners and the representative of India. , The Shelmerdine andFinlay Reports and a report by the Committee of Officials have been communicated to the Dominion and Indian Governments.3. On the 11th March last, the Secretary of State for Air, in accordancewith a decision of the War Cabinet (W.M. (43) 38th Conclusions, Minute 5),announced in the House of Commons that &quot; in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment some form of international collaboration will be essential if the air is tobe developed in the interests of mankind as a whole, trade served, internationalunderstanding fostered, and some measure of international security gained.&quot;(W.P. (43) 91, paragraph 10.) He added that our exploratory work was in hand,and we were now in preliminary consultation with the Dominions and India.Consultation with other members of the United Nations would follow. (O.R.,the 11th March, 1943, Col. 997.)4. Subsequently it was decided, subject to later reference to the WarCabinet, that the Dominion and Indian Governments should be asked to statewhether in their opinion an approach should be made forthwith to the Govern-ments of the United States and the U.S.S.R. on the question of fullinternationalisation of post-war civilian air transport. (The telegram to theDominions and India and subsequent correspondence with them are reproduced in Annex A.)5. The replies from the Dominion Governments agreed that international discussion was desirable, but deprecated the proposal for complete inter-nationalisation, both on the ground that it might be misunderstood by theUnited States and on the ground that it was in itself impracticable. It is clearthat the Dominion Governments desire to reserve their own internal services from control by an international authority, and it is not likely that any post-warGovernment in India will take a different line.6. It appeared desirable, therefore, to clear up the position as between themembers of the British Commonwealth. On the 27th May, therefore, a telegram(Annex A, No. VI) was despatched to the Dominion and Indian governments which suggested that with the object of making rapid progress in the matter andfollowing up the suggestion made by the Canadian Government (that when their examination of the problem was completed they would be glad to beginpreliminary talks with the officials of the Governments of others of the United[25593]b
Nations, especially the United Kingdom and the other INations of the Common-wealth, as well as the United States and the U.S.S.R. see Annex A, No. JV),officials representing the Governments of the British Commonwealth (alone)should meet in London on a purely informal and exploratory basis.The reply of the Canadian Government (Annex A, No. N) of the 6th Junedisagrees with this and suggests that the United States should be asked toparticipate from the beginning in exploratory conversations at Ottawa.7. The latest information we have as to the attitude of the United StatesGovernment is given in Washington Telegram No. 2758 of the 15th June(Annex B). This indicates that the. United States Government is opposed tointernationalisation, but is willing to participate in a conference in Canada towork out an agreement for discussion later with other United Nations. certain items (such as a convention governing meteorology, standards of safety, rules ofair travel, &amp;c, the rights of innocent passage and of landing in emergency andrefuelling) would be acceptable to us, but the proposal that certain airfieldsshould be developed jointly by the United Nations and possibly converted intointernational air-ports requires the closest scrutiny.8. There is no need, however, to go into this question in detail at themoment. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador supports the proposal for a conference between the Dominions, the United States and ourselves on the ground that weshall do better by adopting this procedure, as otherwise we shall risk oppositionboth from the United States and from Canada.9.   There are, therefore, the following issues for decision : -(1) Should we accept the proposal for a conference at Ottawa limited tothe members of the British Commonwealth and the United States 1(2) If a conference is held, what proposals should the United Kingdomput forward or be prepared to support ?(3) Tn&apos; view of the Canadian attitude, is a further attempt to be made tosecure inter-Commonwealth agreement beforehand?10. The Ministerial Sub-Committee desire to recommend the following lineof action to the War Cabinet: &apos;(1) We should accept the proposal for a conference at Ottawa, at which theUnited Kingdom would be represented by a Minister or Ministers.We should, however, make it clear that, in our opinion, an inter-national conference of this importance cannot be held withoutrepresentation of the U.S.S.R. and, possibly. China. As regards theU.S.S.R., an approach was made to the Foreign Secretary by theirAmbassador earlier in the year, who was informed that when we were ready for international discussions the U.S.S.R. would be consulted.(2) The proposals which the United Kingdom might support at the conference are set out in Annex C. There is no doubt that for a large numberof these such as the prescription of safety regulations, the standardisation-tion of radio equipment, &amp;c, there will be general consent. Theproposals suggest that &quot;: freedom of the air&quot; should include onlythe following (i) the right of innocent passage;(ii) the right to land for non-traffic purposes (refuelling, repair,emergency, &amp;c.);(iii) the right to land.passengers, mails and freight embarked in theaircraffs own country of origin.The Convention should not preclude its signatories from dealing&quot;with other varieties of air transport by direct negotiation betweenany two or more countries concerned.Under these proposals it will be open to members of the.BritishCommonwealth to enter into mutual arrangements and equally opento any member of the British Commonwealth to enter into similar arrangements with foreign countries. The latter possibility should be helpful in the case of Canada, which is particularly concerned in. regard to her relationship in these matters with the United States.Without, therefore, having to assert in terms the claim for the British
Commonwealth as a whole to treat services between different parts ofthe- Commonwealth as internal (a claim which may well be resisted byother countries), it would be possible for the members of the Common-wealth to obtain the same results by reciprocal arrangements.(3) It seems most desirable that before any international conference is held a further attempt should be made to secure agreement on principlesbetween members of the Commonwealth. It is therefore suggested- thatthe proposals in Annex C should be telegraphed to the Dominion and indian Governments for their approval before the holding of aconference.(Initialled) W. A.

It seems to us that time has now come when it would bedesirable for us to take the lead in approaching other Governments, and inparticular the United States Government, in the matter. As you are aware, therehas been considerable discussion in the United States, in which divergent viewshave been expressed ranging from advocacy of &quot; free air &quot; policy to policy ofinternationalisation under United Nations control adumbrated by Vice-PresidentWallace.2. We have now had two preliminary meetings on the subject with DominionHigh Commissioners in London, to whom .we have communicated reports of theofficial Committees whose advice we have received. As a result, we have reachedconclusion that best course is for us now to put forward proposal of full inter-nationalisation after the war of all air transport services. By this we understanda system in which all such services throughout the world would be controlled byone central authority.&apos; Such a system should prove most economical owing toadvantages of rationalisation and large-scale operation, and also, by securingabandonment of air transport as an instrument of national policy, contribute substantially to the security and harmony of the world.3. If it is generally agreed that this procedure should be adopted,. it wouldseem to be desirable that the first approach should be made to the United StatesGovernment, and we should hope that you would agree also to join with us incommending the proposal to United States Government.4. If, as is quite possible, the plan is rejected by United States or otherGovernments, the question arises what alternative plan would be most advan-tageous from our point of view and at the same time most likely to command general acceptance. We have, without reaching any final conclusions, given some preliminary Consideration to this point, and, as indicated above, have communi-cated to Dominion High Commissioners in London the results of the,work doneon this by our advisers. But we think, and trust you will agree, that the bestprocedure will be to put forward as our proposal the system of complete inter-nationalisation and to invite those who reject that plan to propound theiralternative plan for making adequate provision for the necessary development ofair transport without imperilling security or provoking a serious clash of national interests. * -[25593]

Civil Aviation.We will consider Commonwealth Government&apos;s observations most carefully.Meanwhile I am repeating it to Canada and Union of South Africa.Telegram from, Australia [Government) to Dominions Office.

No. 206.   Post-war aviation.Commonwealth Government has carefully considered questions raised by you and agrees that it is desirable for an approach to be made to United StatesGovernment on this matter. We assume that if response is favourable, earlyapproach will also be made to U.S.S.R. and United Nations.2. Our view is that the starting point should be an affirmation that civilaviation is subject to those principles of international collaboration which we also hope to see applied to the related problems of a world system of security and post-war economic reorganisation. Peel that if any major post-war issuesuch as civil aviation is decided and ad hoc along the lines merely of national interest the general hopes for the settlement of other issues on the internationalplane will be undermined.3. As regards the actual content of the approach, we fear that the presentation to the United States of a simple proposal for full internationalisationmight arouse suspicion that it is aimed at limiting their undoubted potentialadvantage in air transportation and might immediately lead to the presentation of an alternative plan designed to conserve purely American interests. We would prefer a more general approach on the issue whether or not the principles andspirit of international collaboration which United States spokesmen have affirmedapply to civil aviation and. if so, whether the United States would co-operate in considering ways and means by which such collaboration may be brought aboutfor mutual,benefit.4. For its own part the Commonwealth Government holds the preliminaryview that international collaboration in civil aviation for mutual benefit might best be secured through -(a) general inclusion of all air transport services within the terms of aconvention which would supersede and take over the powers of theInternational Convention on Aerial Navigation with powers revised and extended to control all international air transport;(&amp;) actual operation of certain services (i.e., main international routes) by aninternational air transport authority. Such a system should, weconsider, be framed to allow (a) devolution by the international authority of its management eitherwithin regions or of particular routes;(b) special arrangements for the conduct of international services andthe conduct of short local services between neighbouring countries under bilateral or multilateral agreements subject tosupervision by the international authority.5. We would emphasise that these are preliminary general ideas only, andwould hope to be able to make a contribution to practical details of such a scheme at the appropriate time. It seems evident that the settlement of such detailswill depend partly on the parallel elaboration of a general, system of security.
Letter from the High Commissioner for Canada to the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.(Most Secret.) 24tth May, 1943.My dear Secretary of State,I HAVE now received, for transmission to the United Kingdom Govern-nient, the view of my Government with regard to Dominions Office telegram D,No. 206, of the 7th April, which, as you will recall, dealt with the subject of post-War Civil Aviation.The Canadian Government have for some time been examining the questionof post-war international air transport and, as you will be aware, my PrimeMinister made a general statement on the subject on the 2nd April last, the text of which I sent to you under cover of my note of the 3rd April.* The Inter-Departmental . Committee on International Civil Aviation in Ottawa has nowdrafted its Report and hope to be able to submit it to the War Committee by themiddle of June. Until the Government have received and considered this Reportthey are not likely to be able to elaborate the Prime Minister&apos;s statement of the2nd April.Meanwhile, the Canadian authorities have studied&apos;with interest the Reportsof the three Advisory bodies which the United Kingdom Government have set upto deal with various aspects of post-war air transport. These Reports have been of great assistance to the Canadian Government, who wish to express their appre-ciation of the co-operative action of the United Kingdom authorities in making these documents available to them.With regard to the proposal contained in Dominions Office telegram D No. 206of the 7th April for an approach to the United States Government concerningfull internationalisation after the war of all air transport services, the canadian government doubt the wisdom of putting forward to the United States Govern-ment at this stage &quot;proposals&quot; about air transport. Their impression is. thatto put forward proposals now, and especially proposals for full internationalisa-tion, would be to court rejection on the part of the United States. The canadian authorities think that there is much more likelihood of substantial agreement being reached among the United Nations on this important subject if the presenta-tion of specific proposals is deferred for the time being. Moreover, they have notyet completed their own examination of the question. When that examination is completed they will be glad to begin preliminary talks with the officials of theGovernments of others of the United Nations, especially the United Kingdom andthe other Nations of the Commonwealth, as well as the United States and theU.S.S.R. .The Canadian Government believe that discussions of this character are anessential preliminary to the making of proposals. It may be that, as a result ofthese informal discussions between officials, a number of the Governments con-cerned will find that they are in substantial agreement, and they can then putforward generally agreed proposals for the consideration of other Governments.Yours sincerely,(Signed)      -  VINCENT MASSEY.The Right Hon. C. R. Attlee, M.P.,Dominions Office, S.W. 1.v.(Referred to in IV above.)My dear Secretary of State, 3rd April, 1943.1 am sending you, enclosed, the full text of a statement on Canadian policy regarding air transport which was made by Mr. Mackenzie King in the Houseof Commons at Ottawa yesterday. You will be particularly interested, I think,in the final paragraph, in which the Prime Minister spoke strongly in favour ofa policy of international collaboration in air transport.Yours sincerely&apos;.(Signed).        VINCENT MASSEY.The Right Hon. C. R. Attlee, M.P.* See V, below.
Statement on Air Transport Policy made by the Prime Minister of Canada inthe House of Commons on 2nd April, 1943.Domestic Aviation.1, During the war a remarkable expansion of Canadian aviation has takenplace in the training of air and ground personnel, in the construction ofairports and air navigation facilities, in the manufacture of aircraft, and in theextension of air transport services. Details of this expansion in aviation cannotbe revealed at present, and therefore its magnitude is not generally appreciated.The Canadian Government is aware of the importance of the developments inaviation now in progress and intends that the people of Canada shall benefit from them to the fullest possible extent.2. The expansion of air transport services during the period of the war hasbeen confined to war requirements. Canada has concentrated on the develop-ment of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and on combat flying,and, as a result of agreement with our Allies, military air transport in thenorth-west has largely been undertaken by the United States Army and on theNorth-East Ferry routes by the Ferry Commands. When war necessities permitand suitable equipment can be obtained, the Government will encourage thefurther development within Canada of air transport services to supplement and form part of an up-to-date transportation system for Canada by land, water andair. Transport by air requires close supervision on the part of the Government.The Board of Transport Commissioners will be responsible for regulating trafficmatters and for allocating new routes apart from the lines brought under the trans-Canada Air Lines Act. The Civil Aviation Branch of the Department ofTransport will be responsible for the administration of traffic and safety regula-tions and for the physical development of airways. The Government intends to plan a number of routes suitable for post-war air services and offering trafficpossibilities that will warrant a service. These routes will make use of aerodromes that have been developed for war purposes. The Government willalso continue to develop airports and other facilities for weather reporting and communications which will contribute to the expansion of Canadian air transport.3. While the employment in a peace-time air transport service of all the air and ground personnel of the R.C.A.F. and A.L.T. men and women now employedin the aircraft industry in Canada will be impossible, a considerable number willbe absorbed into the peace-time aviation industry. To this end the Governmenthas undertaken the design of distinctive Canadian types of transport aircraft-suitable for post-war industry in the hope that when the war ends a part atleast of the equipment for Canadian air transport will be furnished by Canadianfactories.4. Trans-Canada Air Lines will1 continue to be the instrument: of theGovernment in maintaining all Trans-Continental Air Transport Services andin operating services across International Boundary Lines and outside Canada.The Government will encourage the company to obtain modern aircraft whichwill keep present services up to modern standards and will expand these services to the fullest extent that post-war conditions permit. The development of supple-mentary routes will continue to be left to private enterprise unless considerations of public interest indicate that certain of these routes should be designated bythe Government as routes to be operated by Trans-Canada Airways. Theoperations of T.C.A. will continue to be limited to important services of a main-line character where the volume of passenger and mail traffic would justify it.International A aviation.5. Canada has a geographical position that will enable it to play animportant part in the development of International air transport routes. Duringthe war the development of international civil air routes must be deferred infavour of military aviation. Canada to-day is the fourth greatest military poweramong the United Nations and in the post-war period Canada can make an equally, great contribution to civilian air transport.6. The future of international air transport, will be determined in large measure by negotiations between the Governments of the United Nations. Thepolicy of the Government at the moment in dealing with all questions which affectinternational air transport is to make temporary arrangements, leaving the issuesopen so that Canada may be able to support in international negotiations when
they take place, whatever policy appears best at that time. The Government,however, intends to press vigorously for a place in international air transporta-tion consistent with Canada&apos;s geographical position and progress in aviation.All concessions and privileges that have been granted by Canada to other countries as part of the war effort will terminate at the end of the war or almost immediately thereafter.. 7. T.C.A. has by its charter the right to operate international air transport services and has already been designated as the instrument of the canadian government in air transport service across the North Atlantic and in Canadianservices to the United States. The fact that international negotiations of greatimportance must shortly take place confirms the wisdom of Government policyunder which its freedom of action in international negotiations is not limited bythe existence of private interests in international air transport services.8. The Government has established an Inter-Departmental Committee on international Civil Aviation to advise it on all matters of international air.trans-port which affect Canada and particularly on the attitude which Canada should adopt towards post-war developments. This Committee has already been atwork for a considerable time.9. The problems of international air transport are, of course, immense and cannot be solved by one country. We are-determined, however, that our influence on the course of events will be in the direction of international co-operation and collaboration. The Canadian Government is in complete agreement with theUnited Kingdom Government that &quot;some form of international collaborationwill be essential if the air is to be developed in the interests of mankind as awhole, trade served, international understanding fostered, and internationalsecurity gained.&quot;Conclusion.10. The policy of the Canadian Government on air transport may be summed up as follows : (a) The Government sees no good reason for changing its policy that Trans-Canada Air Lines is the sole Canadian agency which may operateinternational air services.(b) Within Canada, Trans-Canada Air Lines will continue to operate alltrans-continental systems and such other services of a mainlinecharacter as may from time to time be designated by the Government.Competition between air services over the same route will not be per-mitted, whether between a publicly-owned service and a privately-owned service or between two privately-owned services. There willremain a large field for the development of air transport in whichprivate Canadian companies may participate and, while preventingduplication of services, the Government will continue to encourageprivate companies to develop services as traffic possibilities mayindicate.(c) In order to prepare for forthcoming international negotiations on air transport the . Government is studying carefully the problems whichwill have to be dealt with in the negotiations.. (d) The Canadian Government, strongly favours a policy of international collaboration and co-operation in air transport and is prepared tosupport in international negotiations whatever international air transport policy can be demonstrated as being best calculated to servenot only the immediate national interests of Canada but also our over-riding interest in the establishment of an international order whichwill prevent the outbreak of another world war..

have been able to obtain as to the probable attitude of the United States autho-rities on the subject.The United States authorities have suggested that they would like soon to begin preliminary discussions with us, and clearly it is very desirable that anysuch discussions with the United States should take place, if possible while ideasm the United States are still fluid, and before any definite line has been decided upon. We are disposed to agree with the views expressed, that it might be inadvisable to put forward directly to the United States authorities a plan for complete internationalisation on the lines set out in paragraph 4 of my telegram.At the same time, we feel that, before we enter into informal discussions with united States representatives, we should have attempted to reach some general conclusions as to the scheme of post-war air transport which would be generally acceptable to and best serve the interests of the members of the BritishCommonwealth.With the object of making rapid progress in the matter and following upthe suggestion made by the Canadian Government, we should like to propose thatat the earliest convenient date arrangements should be made for a meeting whichmight be in London, if that is convenient to other Governments, of officialsrepresenting the several Governments on a purely informal and exploratory basis with a view to attempting to work out in greater detail the general ideas suchas those set out in paragraph 4 of the Commonwealth Governments telegram ofthe 15th May, which could afford the basis for useful informal discussions with united States representatives. In the meantime we shall continue our ownexamination of the problem. We shall hope, to have some suggestions ready toput before such a meeting and we should welcome any suggestions which you may feel .able to contribute.

We do not feel,, however, thatpreliminary Commonwealth discussions preparatory to United Kingdomdiscussions with the United States will provide the best approach to mutuallysatisfactory general arrangements. The suggested analogy with the procedureagreed on for preliminary Commonwealth talks in the field of commercial policyis not very close.Having in mind that our connexions in the civil aviation field with theUnited States are as close and numerous as our connexions with any of theCommonwealth countries, we see obvious objections to a course of preliminaryconsultation in London which might be construed as an attempt to formulate a concerted Commonwealth policy before we had had an opportunity of exchangingviews direct with the United States.In the circumstances we think there is much to be said for inviting the UnitedStates to participate from the beginning in the exploratory conversations aboutcivil aviation policy and would be glad to have such talks take place in Ottawaas soon as the other countries concerned could arrange to be represented here. Ifthis suggestion commends itself to the United Kingdom Government, we wouldbe glad to ascertain whether the other Commonwealth Governments and theUnited States would be ready to take part in such an informal exploratorymeeting.XI.[116/90/17]My dear Secretary of State, .      14:th June, 1943.  .Attached is a statement which General Smuts telegraphed to me over theweek-end containing an expression of the preliminary views of the Union Govern-ment on the questions related to the future of Air Transport which have beenbroached in telegrams and reports sent from Dominions Office, and which havealso been the subject of messages exchanged between the Prime.

J. du TOIT,(In the ahsence of the High Commissioner).The Right Hon. C. R. Attlee, P.C., M.P.,Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,Downing Street, S.W. 1.XII.(Enclosure to XI.)Future of Air Transport.Preliminary Views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the Union of South Africa.1. The Union Government have given preliminary consideration to theproblem of civil aviation after the war, and to the communications on the subjectthat have since March been received from and through the British Government.The ideas expressed herein are general and tentative. They are intended as a contribution to the discussions now taking place in London and not as a substantive or final statement of Union Government policy.2. -We should, if necessary, be willing to nominate a representative toattend the meeting of Officials proposed in the telegram of the 29th May, 1943,received from Dominions Office. At the same time it is felt that the contemplatedinformal discussions would necessarily be concerned with details of lesserimportance than the larger questions of policy that remain to be explored on amore authoritative level.3. It appears to us to be exceedingly doubtful whether a plan of completeinternationalisation is either practicable or possesses a chance of general acceptance. We do not favour the idea of putting it forward directly as a considered plan to the United States, by whom its motive might easily bemisconceived. In any event, we are not prepared to go so far as to identifyourselves with it as a major principle of practical policy. The Finlay report,which primarily advocates complete internationalisation, contains the cogentstatement that if the U.S.S.R. and the United States &quot;were required toparticipate in a scheme that involved interference with internal air lines, this fact might well decide them to refuse their collaboration in any form of inter-nationalisation. The same consideration might weigh with the Dominion and indian Governments. The Official Committee, in a subsequent report, says :&apos; The fundamental difficulty inherent. in a scheme of complete internationalisa-tion is that in our view large territorial units like the United States, theU.S.S.R., &amp;c, would be unwilling to resign their internal services to aninternational authority.&apos; &quot; &apos;4. The first step in our opinion is the step now being taken that of elicitingthe tentative views of the Commonwealth countries and trying to see by discussion to what exent they can be harmonised. When that has been accomplished so faras may be feasible, the earliest exploratory conversations with the United states might well be undertaken. The object would be to discover what adherence in keeping with those principles in general concerning post-war organisation towhich the United Nations have subscribed ^would be forthcoming to the principleof international collaboration in the sphere of civil aviation, and for that purpose it does not appear to us to be necessary that Commonwealth policy should havebeen precisely or completely formulated beforehand. It might well in fact prove to be a positive advantage in this difficult and specially susceptible field to engage in preliminary United States conversations without any cut-and-dried schemesallowing positive ideas to emerge from an initial acceptance of the need for collaboration.
5. Discussion with the United States might be expected to result at the least in agreement that would (a) Affirm the necessity for a form of International collaboration having as its aim a scope and authority beyond anything hitherto achieved.&quot;(b) Accept the principle of an International Convention and regulation.(c) Reiterate present understandings that air communications set up in furtherance of the war effort shall be without prejudice to post-wararrangements, and, possibly (d) Extend standstill undertakings to the immediate post-war period.From some such basis of agreement exploratory examination could proceed as tothe length to which practicable collaboration could be carried.6. We have no knowledge of the possible official reactions of the UnitedStates. It will no doubt have been noted that the Chairman of the American CivilAeronautics Board stated in April that the tentative policy of the Administra-tion was a world agreement permitting the aircraft of any country to fly over any other country and land for refuelling and repair. He at the same timeinferred that the American Government could rely on the support of Britishopinion for its policy of air freedom because both Governments had urged sucha policy on the Paris Convention of 1919. That the United States will, in any event require the reservation of widely defined internal services may, we think,be taken for granted. The Finlay report indicated that certainty of a similarstipulation by the U.S.S.R. and the same ultimate ambition on the part of China.7. Believing anything approaching complete internationalisation to be impracticable at the present stage, and in the light of the probable attitude ofother States, we think that on our part there is a strong case on grounds of meritand of policy for holding that Empire Services are internal and should be looked upon as a single entity in any scheme of International collaboration.8.   The Union Government would regard as a necessity the full control of.South African internal air services and would expect to have scope to makeexternal links for mutual benefit with adjacent and other African territories.9. The preliminary views expressed in this communication may be looked upon as favouring reservations to a degree that would unduly limit the scope foruseful International co-operation. It is, however, felt that at this stage of thewar, and on this subject in particular, there is possibly a greater danger in attempting too much as a start than in seeming to accomplish too little. As is recognised, the future of civil aviation has to be considered in parallel with security measures in general and in its relation to the form and degree of disarmament. There should be large scope short of full internationalisation forStates and related national units to work out their own plans and operate themin conformity with the principles and regulations of an air convention.10. Consideration of the many outstanding questions of essential detailshould, we think, be deferred pending an indication of the official ideas andlines of thought of the United States, on whose willingness to agree to measuresof practical collaboration so much admittedly depends.. &apos; ANNEX B.jPjW&apos;  jTim&apos;[&apos;ii iSVui/it n/i Awcrim     Viscount Hali fax ;/\ vepumad. toForeign Office, 15th June, 1943.(No. 2758.)Repeated to Ottawa No. 132 by bag.(Important.)Your telegram No. 3731 and my telegram No. 2612.Mr. Berle told a member of my staff to-day that he hopes to leave for Londonnext week. His idea was to pay the visit before the forthcoming discussions on civil aviation. He was looking forward to seeing Lord Knollys, who is due from21st to 23rd June, if he were still here.  But he might have left before then.2. Mr. Berle spoke quite freely about civil aviation. He emphasised thatthey were only his personal views, but gave the impression that they representedapproximately the probable line that United States Government would take.  He[25593] . p
thought that any form of internationalisation was unrealisable at this stage-He could foresee no likelihood of general agreement upon it. But he believed asensible agreement between United States, Great Britain and the Dominionscould be reached. He had seldom seen such nervous hesitation among allconcerned to tackle a question, but thought there was no reason to be so scaredand that there were the elements of possible agreement between us. Asked where he favoured holding the meeting he enquired what we thought of Ottawa or,failing that, somewhere like Mont Tremblant (near Montreal). It would notbe possible to avoid publicity, but there was no reason to be afraid of it. Sensiblepublicity played down was the right thing (the Daily Express correspondent hasalready asked when the meeting is to take place and there is an article about itin to-day&apos;s Philadelphia Enquirer).3. Mr. Berle was asked whether an agreement between United States,Great Britain and the Dominions might not be represented by other united nations as an attempt to monopolise the pool. He thought the answer was toreach an agreement which would be discussed as soon as possible afterwards withother United Nations with the object of their adhering to it. Main outlinesmight be as follows : firstly, there might be a United Nations convention govern-ing meteorology, standards of safety and rules of air travel including quarantine.Then those airfields which had been developed jointly by the United Nations(principally, of course, by the United States and ourselves) and perhaps othersmight perhaps be turned into International airports.. If they proved practicableseadromes might be established on the same basis. While in some ways the UnitedStates would be the principal gainer by this (since the fields were mot hers), thiswould not be so in others, e.g., seadromes in the Pacific would largely diminish the importance of Hawaiian islands. There should at least be agreement onright of innocent passage together with right of landing in emergency or forrefuelling in national territory everywhere. He himself favoured adding to this right of disembarking or picking up passengers or freight, but without rights ofcabotage.. Thus, for example, a British aircraft bound for a destination beyondUnited States could disembark passengers or freight in United States or pickthem up there for carriage to another country, but could not pick them up forcarriage purely within United States.4. Mr. Berle said that Congressional civilian and military committeesconcerned had devoted much attention to special position of Great Britain afterthe war. They recognised that we should be handicapped because by agreementwith us we were producing few transport aircraft and concentrating, for instance,on fighters. A partial solution would be that no one proposed to forbid GreatBritain to buy aircraft from United States (the military authorities had alreadyallotted us several hundred transport aircraft for war purposes). Further, the- plan sketched above would present many more advantages than free-for-allcompetition, but he admitted that question whether domestic American airlineswere to be unified or to remain in competitive hands was still unsettled. Inaddition, he suggested that while limitation of subsidies as a means of limitingcut-throat international competition would probably prove impracticable, thereshould be international agreement on the model of shipping conferences asto minimum rates which would be supervised and adjusted at given intervals.In this way rate-cutting competition which would benefit a company such asPan-American Airways, would be prevented. He hoped that there would be nolimitation on rights of countries to buy and sell aircraft freely.5.   In all the foregoing special measures that might be taken against&quot; aggressor &quot; States were excluded. V-6. Asked^about Latin America, TSftfrfierfe-^dr^at&apos; &apos;*F n^.&amp;ifiierican had acquired certain subsidiary companies there. The United States Government didnot wish to see the capital of any such companies remain in American hands, butbe turned over to nationals of the countries concerned. He presumed that GreatBritain would wish to have air services to Latin America, and this was natural.His idea was that United States and ourselves should secure by negotiation against-reciprocal agreement terminal or landing rights in Latin American countries.Brazil, for instance, would certainly welcome this.
. ANNEX &apos;C.Post-War Air Transport.Proposed Statement for Communication to the Dominions.It is now clear that the full internationalisation of post-war air transport will not meet with general acceptance and it is important that, in preparation forany forthcoming international Conference, the members of the British Common-wealth should reach agreement among themselves on certain general principles asa.basis for discussion with the United States and other nations. The following principles are suggested : 1. The members of the Commonwealth will endeavour to achieve themaximum degree of international co-operation in the development, operation and regulation of air transport in the interests of mankind as a whole.2. They will support the establishment of an International Air TransportAuthority to administer a Convention which would (i) define whatever doctrine of the freedom of the air is accepted and require its acceptance by ratifying States (see 4, below);(ii) prescribe safety regulations, such as those contained in the 1919 Con-vention, e.g., rules of the air, air worthiness, licensing of personnel and aircraft, ground signals, meteorological procedure, prohibition ofcarriage of dangerous goods, &amp;c;(iii) provide for the standardisation so far as possible of radio equipment and technique, ground services and meteorological facilities;(iv) deal with customs and immigration procedure together with sanitaryregulations;(v) lay down conditions for the exemption of fuel and oil from Customs and excise duties;(vi) provide for control by States over the operating agencies which theyselect through a system of licensing and for acceptance of the principlethat States would license only those agencies which undertook to observe the International Convention;(vii) provide for the collection and review of information about servicesmaintained, operational costs, nature and extent of subsidies, rates ofcarriage, landing fees, &amp;c.;(viii) secure recognition of the principle that all States should be responsiblefor the provision in accordance with the specifications laid down inthe Convention of the ground facilities needed in their territories.(In the case of countries unable or unwilling to provide the necessary facilities, special arrangements involving financial assistance wouldprobably be necessary);(ix) establish the Authority as an appellate tribunal against the impositionof unreasonable landing charges and servicing charges.3. The members of the Commonwealth will support the establishment ofinternational operating agencies on particular routes or in particular areas,especially in the case of services now operated by enemy air lines in Europe andin the Far East.4. &apos;&apos; Freedom of the air &apos;&apos; is understood by the United Kingdom Governmentto mean the following (i) the right of innocent passage;(ii) the right to land for non-traffic purposes (e.g., refuelling, repair,emergency, &amp;c.);(iii) the right to land passengers, mails and freight embarked in the aircraffsown country of origin;5. The Convention should not preclude its signatories from dealing withthe following rights by direct negotiations between any two or more countries concerned : (i) the right to embark passengers, mails and freight destined- for theaircraft&apos;s own country of origin;(ii) the right to convey passengers, mails and freight between two countriesneither being the aircrafts own country of origin;(iii) the right to convey passengers, mails and freight between two points in.any one country not being the aircrafts own country of origin.
These last three questions appear to be appropriate for negotiation between individual signatories to the general Convention, and this would give the fullestscope for members of the Commonwealth to make individual arrangements bothamongst themselves and also with foreign countries.6. The members of the Commonwealth will, subject to the above principles,seek to develop intra-imperial services on a co-operative basis to the fullest extent,either by the creation of a Commonwealth Air Transport operating corporation,or by joint arrangements between the chosen instruments of the United Kingdomand Dominion Governments respectively, or by any of these methods.7. The members of the Commonwealth will combine to develop aeronauticaleducation, research, and technical developments to the fullest extent.8. In order to eliminate uneconomic competition as far as possible, and tokeep subsidies within reasonable bounds, it would be desirable to regulate byagreement the frequency of services, the standards of passenger accommodation,the rates of carriage, &amp;c. Some of these questions are perhaps not best handled by governmental negotiation and it might be preferable to leave them to be agreed by the operating agencies concerned through some machinery similar to thatof a Shipping Conference. Agreement on rates, frequencies, &amp;c, combined withthe provision of adequate ground services by the countries concerned, should help to limit the scale of cash subsidies. But it might be desirable to make provisionfor arbitration on disputes (which the Conference proved unable to resolve)about rate cutting, &amp;c. It should probably be the responsibility of the inter-national authority administering the Convention to provide machinery for thispurpose.9. The problem of Europe is a particularly difficult one in which considera-tions of security must necessarily play a primary part. It will probably have tobe settled in principle (in conjunction with the United States and the U.S.S.P.)within the framework of post-war security before it can be discussed with theother United Nations. Provision will have to be made for the various trunkroutes which will necessarily pass through Europe, but, as regards theContinent&apos;s internal services, it might be desirable to constitute a singleinternational operating organisation to undertake the operation of all services inEurope, the whole of the Continent being regarded as one unit for this purpose.It would, however, be necessary to take account of the desire of certain countries,e.g., France, the Netherlands, &amp;c, to operate services of their own from theirEuropean territories to their overseas possessions.
