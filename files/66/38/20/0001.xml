NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. H.M. and Allied submarines have been active in the Mediterranean.Four ships are reported to have been sunk during the week.   : .One U-boat has been sunk, two probably sunk and one possibly damaged.Home Waters.2. On the 22nd H.M.S. A chilles (cruiser), refitting at Portsmouth, was damaged by an explosion in an oil fuel tank. Thirteen dockyard men were killed and 43 injured.H.M.C.S. Athabaskan (destroyer) was damaged in collision on the 18th.Mediterranean.3. The following attacks have been reported by H.M. and Alliedsubmarines :  ...The French Arethuse on the 4th torpedoed a 6,000-ton ship at anchor offthe north-east coast of Sardinia; the----vessel was later seen aground. Uproaron the 5th torpedoed a 15,000-ton northbound tanker off the south-east coast ofItaly. Safari on: the 10th, off the east coast of Sardinia, sank a 1,000-ton shipcarrying motor transport and petrol. Tactician sank a schooner and damaged the escort vessel by gunfire off Bari (S.E. Italy) on the 12th, and on the 14thtorpedoed a 7,600-ton ship off Corfu. Off the Strait of Messina United sank a7,000-ton armed merchant cruiser and a medium-sized ship; Ultor shelled the wireless station on Salina, one of the Lipari Islands, on the 13th, sank a1,200-ton ship and torpedoed a small Italian destroyer on the 15th; and Unrulytorpedoed a 5,000-ton ship on the 14th.4. A naval party from H.M.S. Ttoubridge (destroyer) landed on LampionIsland on the 14th. They found it uninhabited and re-embarked. H.M. ships have embarked a total of 4,000 service prisoners from Lampedusa and over;10,000from Pantelleria.The harbour of - Pantelleria is now in use by our light craft.The French destroyer Leopard, which ran aground off Benghazi on the27th May, is now a total loss.H.M.S. Zingarella (schooner) ran ashore on the 20th north of El Agheila;salvage is being attempted.5. The French battleship Lorraine and the cruisers Suffren, Duguay-Trouinand Tourville, left Alexandria for the Suez Canal on the 22nd, escorted by destroyers.Australia.6. H.M.A.S. Wallaroo (minesweeper) was sunk in collision with an Alliedmerchant ship off the west coast of Australia.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. Twenty-nine attacks on U-boats have been reported during the week;19 by aircraft (four .in the Mediterranean), two by submarines (one in theMediterranean), and eight by ships.. On the 16th a Hudson (A. 29) sank a U-boat off Haifa, probably the onewhich had sunk a British tanker on the previous evening. Thirty survivors were seen in the water, 21 of whom were later rescued.On the 4th H.M. Submarine Truculent probably sank a U-boat north-east ofthe Faeroes. On the 20th a U.S. Catalina (PBY) attacked a U-boat south-west of Iceland (C). German wreckage found later showed that the attack, was probably successful.On the 19th a U-boat was possibly damaged north of Madeira by a U.S.Army Liberator (B. 24).
Enemy Intelligence.German.8. Apart from making good the losses of merchant shipping tonnage andescort vessels German naval construction is now confined to destroyers, U-boats,and &quot; M &quot; class minesweepers. Of these, three or four destroyers, about 20minesweepers, and up to 150 U-boats are expected to be completed between now and January 1944.There is some evidence that in their urgent need of U-boat personnel theGermans may have decided to make heavy drafts from some of their surface ships, which would produce a temporary loss of efficiency until the new drafthad been worked up by intensive exercises.Italian.9. The 6&quot; cruiser reported last week to have left Taranto has been located in Spezia. The 6&quot; cruiser Luigi Cadorna, last reported at Pola, was seen atBrindisi on the 18th.Japanese.10. Some units of the Japanese main fleet are believed to have returned tothe mandated islands, but the principal force is still in Home Waters.The Japanese have established a small base on Choiseul Island (Solomons).U-boats.11. Some 90 U-boats are estimated to be operating in the Atlantic and indian Oceans, the main force, totalling about 40, being in the area between the azores and the West Indies. Four or five are off the U.S. coast and two or threeoff Brazil. About six are believed to be still in South African waters, but theyhave made no attacks since the beginning of the month and may have withdrawn to refuel. ,The group sailing of U-boats in and out of the Bay of Biscay has resultedin a reduction in the proportion of attacks to sightings. Similar tactics arenow being adopted by U-boats south of Iceland (C).One Japanese U-boat was reported during the week off Addu Atoll, andthere is probably another in the Gulf of Aden.Enemy Attack on Shipping.12. Three ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during theweek. A French tanker bound for Dakar was sunk east of Bermuda. One ship in an eastbound convoy was sunk off Algiers. The s.s. Yoma (8,131 tons), in convoy from Gibraltar to Alexandria, was sunk north of Cyrene (Cyrenaica). Ofa total of 1,670 service personnel on board, 1,353 were rescued.One ship was sunk and a second seriously damaged by aircraft in a smallescorted convoy southbound off Cape St. Vincent. A straggler from a homeboundconvoy from Gibraltar was damaged by air attack off Lisbon. An eastboundconvoy was subjected to a prolonged but unsuccessful attack by aircraft offBizerta.A U.S. ship was mined off Dakar but reached the port.-Protection of Seaborne Trade.13. During the week ending the 20th 829 ships were convoyed. Of these,208 were in ocean convoys and 621 in British coastal convoys. Seventy-two destroyers (including 14 U.S. destroyers), 104 sloops, frigates, cutters and corvettes(including two French sloops and four U.S. corvettes), one escort carrier and oneocean boarding vessel were employed on escort duties.Three ocean convoys consisting of 121 ships arrived in Home Waters duringthe week without loss.. 14. During the week ending the 19th, imports into the United Kingdom by ships in convoy totalled 867,000 tons, compared with 691,000 tons during theprevious seven days and an average of 808,000 tons during the past ten weeks. &apos; Ofthe week&apos;s imports, 352,000 tons were mineral oil of various grades.British Minelaying.15. During the week aircraft laid mines off the Frisian Islands *TVd in the bay of Biscay.[25622]    ,
Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.16. No minelaying in Home Waters by enemy surface craft or aircraft was reported during the week. Fifteen ground and seven moored mines were destroyed,the majority in the Outer Thames Estuary and west of Portland respectively.The mine totals are : 4,383 ground and 2,929 moored.In the Mediterranean minelaying by aircraft was suspected off Pantelleria.Sweeping has continued off Halifax (Nova Scotia), where 53 mines have been destroyed since the beginning of the month.Enemy Merchant Shipping.17. A transfer of 350-ton tanker barges from Northern France to theMediterranean has recently taken place, probably entirely by inland waterways asthe limitation of the length of these barges to 125 feet enables them to pass throug hall sections of the canals.These barges might assist the enemy in the following ways : &apos;(a) In obtaining a greater measure of dispersal of his bulk supplies in transit, which has been hindered by the shortage of the smaller-sizedtanker.(b) In distributing petroleum products from heavily bombed ports.(c) In supplying Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily at small landing places.Eleven arrivals and nine sailings of ore ships have been reported from Bilbaoduring the week. It is stated that all the ships carrying ore between Bilbao andBayonne have been degaussed.Spanish Intelligence.18. Alp Spanish submarines are to be painted white as a distinguishingfeature.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.19. There has been local fighting N.E. of Orel and in the Taman area, but nothing of importance has happened during the week.Mediterranean Area.North A frica.- 20. On the night of the 17th/18th some of the parachutists who had been landed in the Benghazi area on the night of the 13th/14th succeeded in destroyingfive aircraft.Up to the 18th a further 66 Italian parachutists, some of whom werejound inpossession of maps showing airfields, had been captured at various points in north africa.   This brings the total captured up to 105; the search continues.Burma.Chin Hills.21. On the 18th a Commando party surprised a detachment of Japanese east of Fort White and inflicted casualties without loss to themselves.Sumprabum.22. The Japanese are making attempts to cross to the west side of the MalaKha river which is a tributary of the Irrawaddy in N.E. Burma.South-West Pacific Area.New Guinea,.23. Australian troops are continuing to patrol in the Mubo area. TheJapanese attacked their positions on the Lubabia ridge two miles N.E. of Muboand were driven off suffering 100 casualties.
AIR SITUATION.General Review.24.   By day, U.S. heavy bombers effectively attacked a rubber works at Huls;and, by night, aircraft of Bomber Command operated in force against Krefeldand Mulheim and, on a smaller scale, against the Schneider Works at Le Creusot.Attacks were made on Naples, the ferry termini between Sicily and Italy andon Sicilian airfields.In the Pacific Zone, 94 enemy aircraft were destroyed over Guadalcanal.United Kingdom.25.   In daylight no enemy aircraft were reported overland.At night a total of 37 long-range bombers and 35 fighter-bombers crossedour coast. A short sharp attack by 15 bombers was made on Hull; other raids were scattered over south and south-east England and about six aircraft flew over London. One F.W. 190 landed at Manston and another was shot down bya Mosquito.  -Coastal Operations.26. Escorted Beaufighters, of which two are missing, sank five escort vessels and, probably sank a merchantman in an attack on a convoy off the Dutch Islands.Three Hampdens torpedoed a 2,500-ton ship and possibly hit another, offNorway.four Mosquitoes attacked the sea7plane base at Lake Biscarosse (50 miles.W. of Bordeaux); a hangar was set on fire, a minesweeper damaged and foursea-planes destroyed.Twenty-one small ships were damaged by fighters and fighter bombers, mostlyoff the Dutch coast.Bomber Command aircraft, of which 109 were despatched, laid 367 sea mines in enemy waters.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.27. Heavy bombers of the U.S. VIIIth  Air Force made their firstattack on the Ruhr when 237 Fortresses (B. 17) were despatched against the synthetic rubber works at Huls (near Recklinghausen). The target, which is thesecond largest works of its kind in Germany, was attacked in&apos; good weather by169 aircraft and these dropped 382 tons of bombs. Bombing was reported tohave been &apos;&apos; good &apos;&apos; and this is confirmed by photographs taken during the raidwhich show bursts distributed over the whole of the plant, with probable hits onthe power station and the three gas holders; several fires due to hits on oil andother pipe lines are visible. Diversionary attacks were made by 36 escortedFortresses (B. 17) on the General Motors assembly works at Antwerp and by12 escorted Mitchells (B. 25) on the Wilton shipbuilding yards at Rotterdam.From these operations, 20 Fortresses (B. 17) and four fighters are missing; 53enemy aircraft were destroyed, 32 probably destroyed and 32 damaged..Escorted medium, light and fighter bombers attacked airfields at Poix,Abbeville/Drucat and Maupertus, the airframe factory at Meaulte and amaintenance unit at St. Omer. In these operations and on fighter sweeps, 12 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of six Allied fighters.Attacks on enemy transport resulted in damage to five trains, eightlocomotives and six small craft.Night.28.   Aircraft of Bomber Command attacked the following targets: Aircraft AttackedDes-    Primary   TonnageDate.     patched. Target,   of bombs. Missing.

The Schneider works at Le Creusot, which have been largely restored to production since the daylight raid on the 17th October, 1942, and the nearbyMontchanin transformer station were bombed in bright moonlight. At the latter,several direct hits are claimed with resultant blue flashes. Damage at Le Creusotand from the attack on the R.D.F. components factory at Friedrichshaven (onLake Constance) is referred to in Appendix VI. The aircraft on Friedrichshavenflew on and landed in North Africa.Favourable weather conditions were experienced, over Krefeld and Mulheim,with bombing well concentrated round accurately placed markers, and it isprobable that the attack on the former was an outstanding success.Mosquitoes operated on six nights of the week making small-scale raids on berlin, Duisburg, Cologne, Dusseldorf and Hamborn.Intruder operations, by aircraft of Fighter Command and of the tactical air Force, resulted in the destruction of six enemy aircraft and damage to23 locomotives, 17 trains and four E-bqats; three aircraft are missing. -Mediterranean.Italy and Sicily.29. Heavy attacks were made on the ferry termini at Messina, San Giovanniand Reggio Di Calabria.On the 18th 84 Fortresses (B. 17) released over 150 tons of bombs at Messina,and two nights later a further 150 tons were dropped by Wellingtons. bursts were seen on ferry ships, and warehouses and many fires were started in therailway marshalling yards and terminus area. Liberators (B. 24) and Halifaxesmade three raids on Reggio Di Calabria and San Giovanni and dropped a totalof nearly 260 tons of bombs; the ferry berth area was believed to be seriously damaged and a westbound &quot;ferry was hit and capsized. A reconnaissance on the21st reported that in the harbour of Messina was one damaged tanker, twobeached 1-ihers and two vessels of 200/400 feet which were either beached or damaged; the ferry service was still operating, but only part of the railway line was in use. In the course of these operations one force of 20 U.S. Liberators(B. 24) was intercepted by about 40 enemy fighters and shot down 20 of them without loss.Naples was bombed in daylight by 49 Fortresses (B. 17) and on two occasionsat night by Wellingtons. Considerable damage to the railway centre, the torpedofactory, and an oil refinery was reported and a large part of the Royal Arsenal wasgutted. Other targets bombed in the same area were the air stores depot and railway centre at Cancello, the railway centre at Salerno, both of which were wellcovered, and at the latter hits were made on a large railway bridge and therailway centre and repair sheds at Battipaglia.Forty-nine Lancasters, constituting part of a force which had landed in north Africa after bombing Friedrichshaven, attacked Spezia at night on their return flight to this country. An effective smoke-screen obscured the battleshipsand the bombing was somewhat scattered.The airfield at Comiso was successfully attacked on three occasions and raids were also made on Trapani/Milo and Biscari airfields.Mosquito intruders from Malta attacked railway targets in Sicily and southern Italy and caused a considerable amount of damage.Sardinia. . ,30. Eighty-seven Marauders (B. 26) with an escort of Lightnings (P. 38)made three attacks on the harbour at Olbia. Hits were obtained on several ships;one exploded, two others were set on fire a,nd small craft in-the inner harbour were left in flames. Golfo Aranci was bombed by 36 escorted Mitchells (B. 25) and damage was caused to the jetty, warehouses and railway tracks. These raids were heavily engaged by enemy fighters, 34 of which were shot down for the loss . ,of three Marauders (B. 26) and two Lightnings (P. 38). A formation of JWarhawks (P. 40 F) destroyed or damaged eight enemy aircraft on Vallicidrolanding ground.A tanker of 7,000 tons N.E. of Sardinia was torpedoed by a Wellington and later reported to be sinking.North-West Africa.31. Enemy attacks were made on Philippeville, Djidjelli, Bizerta, Bone,Tunis, and on one of our convoys off Bone, but no damage of any importance hasbeen reported.
aegean Sea and West Coast of Greece.32.   Long-range fighters destroyed or damaged eight sailing vessels.Battle Casualties and Sorties.33. During the week ended the 22nd &quot;June, 124 enemy aircraft were shot down; 11 Allied bombers and 14 fighters are missing. A total of 5,705 sorties were flown.Russia.34. The Russians continued to make night attacks with long-range bombers,chiefly against enemy airfields; railway junctions at Unecha and Roslavl were also attacked. Day attacks were made on railway targets near Balakleya and on airfields in the Leningrad area.Strategic night bombing by the German Air Force on industrial targets farbehind the front was continued. Many of these attacks were carried out atranges exceeding 500 miles from operational bases. In addition, railways,airfields and strategic targets immediately behind the front were constantlyattacked both by day and night over the whole front between Orel and the black sea.   It would that the enemy is at pains to dislocate or hinder any possible Soviet preparations for attack.It is estimated that there are at present some 1,900 aircraft available to theGerman Air Force for operations in Russia. This compares with an estimateof 2,500 at the corresponding date last year, and the reduced strength is a reflec-tion of increased commitments on the Western Front and in the Mediterranean.Burma.35. In the Upper Chindwin, two attacks were made on both Indainggyiand Kalemyo; at the latter a bridge was hit.Liberators (B. 24) attacked Lashio (Burma/China frontier) and inflictedconsiderable damage.In Central Burma, medium bombers made seven attacks on targets in theMandalay area. Apart from hits on the approaches to the bridges at Myinmuand Myitnge, no specific results are reported. Medium bombers also attackedYenangyuang, where oik cisterns were set on fire.In the Mayu Peninsula, escorted Vengeances (A. 31) attacked enemy-occupiedvillages.In the South, Liberators (B. 24) bombed W/T installations on DiamondIsland and railway targets at Thanbyuzayat (near Moulmein) and Yamethin.No enemy activity has been reported.China.36. Escorted Mitchells (B. 25) attacked Shihshow-hsien (160 miles S.WV&quot;of Hankow) in support of Chinese land forces.Allied.fighters destroyed seven aircraft of an enemy formation operating overthe Kanchow area (200 miles N.N.E. of Hongkong).Pacific Zone.New Guinea.37. Allied air activity was mainly directed against enemy positions in theLae/Salamoa area. Lightnings (P. 38) intercepted 36 enemy aircraft over Laeand, without loss, destroyed 14 and probably destroyed nine.In the Huon Gulf, Allied bombers sank five barges and damaged others.The airfield at Madang was raided by ten Mitchells (B. 25).Enemy aircraft were more active and made nine attacks, mostly ineffective.Three of these were directed against Beha-Bena (100 miles W.N.W. of Lae),where some buildings and stores were destroyed; and, at Guadagazal (42 miles. of Lae), an ammunition dump was hit.New Britain.38. A total of 53 heavy bombers made three night attacks on airfields inthe Rabaul area.
Amboina Archipelago.39. Night attacks were made on Koepang, Laha and Penfoei airfield inTimor, and on Langgoer in the Kai Islands. The seaplane base at Taberfane(Aru Islands) was bombed by escorted Liberators (B. 24); a float-plane was destroyed and six others damaged.Solomon Islands.40. Escorted Allied dive- and torpedo-bombers attacked a supply centre at Dairong (New Georgia) and an enemy base at Sagigar (Choiseul Island),. Twonight attacks by heavy bombers were made on Kahili (Bougainville Island).On the 16th, a force of 60 enemy bombers, escorted by 60 fighters, was intercepted by U.S. fighters in the Guadalcanal area; 77 aircraft were destroyed for the loss of six U.S. aircraft and a further 17 of the enemy were destroyedby A.A. fire from U.S. ships and the ground.Australia.41. On the 21st, 28 escorted enemy bombers attacked Darwin causing only slight damage; Spitfires, of which two are missing, destroyed 12 of the enemy and probably destroyed or damaged a further 12.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.42. Enemy raids on this country have occurred on five nights. For thesecond successive week there have been no incidents during daylight. On eachnight bombs were dropped at a.number of scattered points near the South Coastor in the Home Counties; on four nights incidents also occurred in London.On the 17th/18th bombs dropped in the Portsmouth area caused 75 casualtiesat H.M.S. Collingwood (R.N. shore establishment). The parcel section of theMount Pleasant Post Office in London was hit and destroyed by fire, but much ofthe contents were salvaged. On the 23rd/24th there was rather more concen-trated bombing at Hull; some 20 H.E. and numerous LBs., including explosivetype, were dropped, seriously damaging several factories. Casualties so farreported include 19 killed.Elsewhere damage, which was mostly limited to house property, was slightand casualties were light.In the early part of the week there was still a diversion of traffic, and temporary evacuation at Grimsby (bombed on the&apos;13th/14th), where the disposalof a large number of U.X.Bs., mostly of anti-personnel type, continued.Casualties.43. The estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 hours onthe 23rd were 10 killed and 20 seriously injured.

APPENDIX VI.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports have been received during the week : Germany.dusseldorf. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the18th June, and covering the centre of the city, shows that well over a thousandacres have been devastated. The damage, which has mainly been caused by fire,is by far the most extensive yet seen. No estimate of the total effect can yet begiven, but between the railway and the river the devastation is such that interest is focussed upon those few buildings which still remain unaffected.The industrial district of Oberbilk was covered by photographs taken on the20th June. An immediate interpretation shows that the extremely heavy damagepreviously seen on photographs of the centre of the city is repeated in this district.Many important buildings and factories have been affected and there is a hundredacres of devastation in the business residential area.Wwppertal. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the20th June shows very heavy damage in the Barmen area where a thousand acreshave been devastated. In the interval considerable clearance work has been undertaken, but there is little activity to be seen.Bochum. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the18th June shows heavy damage in the town and to the east and west. The two principle&apos;steelworks have received further damage. Direct hits are seen on theCentral Station and tramway centre, and in the old town there is a devastatedarea of 40 acres.Oberhausen.-Limited cover obtained on the 18th June shows that very heavy damage has been caused in the parts seen. The railway repair shops are morethan half destroyed and the electricity works and tramways depot damaged.Wilhelmshaven. A final interpretation of the photographs taken on the13th June after the U.SA.A.F. daylight attack on the 11th June confirms that most of the damage has been caused in and about the harbour. In the area north of Ausrustungshafen, two long barrack buildings in Moltke Strasse have been severely damaged and two naval barrack blocks near Ostfriesen Strasse have been partly, destroyed; many other buildings and sheds in this area have also been destroyed or seriously damaged.A direct hit has damaged one side of Hafenthor Bridge and a building(210 feet x 100 feet) of the seaplane station has been gutted over an area of775 square yards.Two oil storage cisterns at the south-west corner of Scheerhafen have beenburnt out and two more in Seydlitz Briicke have been damaged. Several buildings in the vicinity of the main railway station have been destroyed or damaged, andtwo small buildings at the torpedo-boat station severely damaged.Bremen. Photographs taken during the attack by. the U.S.A.A.F. on the13th June show that the main weight fell in the area around Basin I. Severaldirect hits are seen on the Atlas shipyards, among warehouses on the quay andon sidings and engine sheds to the north. . Other bombs have fallen in the districts of Woltmerhausen, Neustadt and Gropelingen. An interesting feature is the elaborate and intensive smoke screen seen in operation. On these photographsthe ejectors are seen to extend 12 miles east/west and 11 miles north/south.Flensburg. It is learnt from the Press that after the U.S.A.A.F. attackon the 19th May, no trams ran for five days, but it was hoped thereafter to resumea restricted service, to be used only by passengers going for a minimum journeyof eight stopping places.Friedrichshafen. Photographs taken on the 21st June show that in thesouth-east part of the Zeppelin works three- acres have been devastated andother buildings in the works have suffered some damage by blast. Blast damage has.also been caused to the engine works of Maybach Motorenbau.
France.Le Creusot. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the20th June shows that the armament and locomotive works have suffered consider-able damage particularly in the steel works section.St. Nazaire. An final interpretation of the photographs taken after theU.S.A.A.F.. daylight attack on the 29th May shows that approximately 3^ acreson the Quai Demange were devastated. In this area seven dockside buildings were destroyed or severely damaged by fire and H.E.A large shed on the Quai de Commerce was damaged, and one building andone shed of the munitions storage depot at Trignac were respectively damaged and part destroyed.A 520-ft. M/V on the slipways in the Chantier et Atelier de Penhouet hasbeen damaged by blast.Belgium.Antwerp. In the attack by the U.S.A.A.F. on the Erla works on the5th April at least 50 aircraft were destroyed or rendered useless and 20Q aircraftengines were destroyed, or severely damaged.Italy.Leghorn. Photographs taken on the 31st May show that the main weight ofthe attack fell on the dock area, where severe damage has been caused and is mostconcentrated in the Mediceo Dock and the Cappelini. and Firenze Docks. Anumber of warehouses and dockside buildings have been destroyed or badly damaged, including the bonded stores covering 192,000 sq. ft., which are seen to be half destroyed and still burning in two places at the time of photographing,three days after the attack.
