Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 263.22nd June, 1943.WAR CABINET.YUGOSLAV GOVERNMENT CRISIS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed theCabinet on the 31st May (see War Cabinet Conclusions 79 (43) of the 31st May,1943) that another crisis in the Yugoslav Government seemed imminent.Sir Alexander Cadogan also stated that my view was that the best solution wouldbe for King Peter to install himself in the Middle East with three or fourMinisters and to leave the remainder of the Government in this country.2. The crisis developed last week, although not quite in the mannerexpected, and the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Government were obliged to resign. On the morning of the 17th June, shortly before the Prime Ministertendered his resignation, King Peter came to inform me of the- position. HisMajesty explained that M. Yovanovic had with great difficulty got all themembers of the Government to agree to the terms of the declaration of policy regarding the political future of Yugoslavia. A few days later, however, theCroat members of the Government precipitated a crisis by what amounted to a vote of non-confidence in the Prime Minister. King Peter read me extracts fromspeeches made at a Cabinet meeting which showed that this lack of confidencewas shared by the majority of the Government; and King Peter himself felt thatthe best thing would be for M. Yovanovic to resign.3. I took this opportunity of telling King Peter that I did not feel thatany re-shuffle of the Government would be likely to solve the problem, but thatsome more drastic step was now required. I suggested, therefore, that King Petershould install himself in the Middle East for the duration of the war and take with him the four or five principal members of his Government. King Peter said he had been considering something of the kind himself and appeared to like theproposal.4. King Peter is now trying to form a new Government, and I know thathe is considering acting on my advice.*        g       J A. E.Foreign Office, 22nd June, 1943.12068   [25611]
