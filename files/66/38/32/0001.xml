SPEECH ON THE TRADE DISPUTES BILL BY Mr. CHURCHILL ASCHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER ON MAY 30, 1927.(Hansard, Vol. CCVII, Columns 60-74.)Mr. Churchill: Everyone will recognise the peculiar right and the peculiarqualifications of the hon. Member for North Camber well (Mr. Ammon) to speak on this subject, and I would congratulate him upon the doughty stand he hasmade on behalf of those interests which have been committed to his care, and thefull and careful manner in which he has placed before us a very large numberof considerations which are urged by those members of the Civil Service who are opposed to the legislation which we now have under consideration. At the sametime, I should hardly think it was appropriate for the hon. Gentleman to reproachthe Government with having made up their minds to drive this Bill through, andto pay no attention to argument of any kind, because, after all, the party withwhich the hon. Member is associated, and on whose Front Bench he sits, declared their intention of opposing this Bill long before it was introduced. One of thereproaches made, on the other hand, against the Government and my right hon.friend the Attorney-General, has been that we, in the course of the long period during which this measure has been before the country, have shown ourselveswilling to accept a great many changes, to such an extent that we have even beentaunted with re-writing some of the clauses of our Bill.I am very glad that the discussion of this clause should be conducted in thesame cool and restrained atmosphere which has characterised so many days of the debates on this measure. I do not believe there is any clause in the whole of theBill which is more likely to gather to itself an overwhelming preponderance ofpublic opinion throughout the country than this clause dealing with the CivilService. It is an extremely modest and moderate clause. It is no use making outthat it is a clause which creates some vast revolutionary change in the life of theaverage civil servant. I, myself, believe that, if no word of these debates onthis legislation could ever be published outside this House, 99 civil servantsout of 100 would, in their ordinary conduct of life, their ordinary principlesof life, have been unconscious that this Bill was passed or that any changewhatever had taken place. I believe they will be able to live exactly the same kind of lives after this Bill has passed, and to have the same effective protection and the same rights as they have enjoyed for a great many years.This Bill is not intended to make sweeping changes affecting the CivilService. It is not intended to cause a violent overthrow of the principles whichhave guided the Civil Service. On the contrary, it is intended to preserve theprinciples that have for a great many years been the credit and the distinctionof the British Civil Service, and, by timely action, to correct unwholesome growthswhich in the last few years have been steadily creeping in, and of which we had certain evidence, to which I will come presently, a year ago at the time of thegeneral strike. The clause was very effectively and compendiously described bythe Attorney-General in his opening speech on the Bill, and I do not wish to repeat what was then said, but the effect of the clause is limited to establishedcivil servants. That is very important, because the position of the established civil servant is a coveted position. I think that, for the Civil Service as a whole, thereare between two and three candidates for every vacancy, and the status of an established civil servant is a greatly desired status. To be permanently employed,,to be employed all your working life and to be pensionable at the end of yourservice, and to have these advantages guaranteed, not by a private, employer, who may rise or fall owing to the competitive accidents of the world of business, butby a strong, stable State and nation these are conditions which are greatlydesired and greatly valued and cherished by a very large number of people inthe country. It is only to this class of established civil servants, permanent andpensionable, that the special provisions of this clause apply. We consider that,,in view of their special permanent and pensionable position, the State is entitled,to demand from them a particular relationship; and the object of the State, in giving these special conditions, is to secure faithful service in all circumstances in the hour of need.[25629]B
The hon. Member who moved this amendment, as a peg upon which our -general discussion, by the ruling of the Chair, is to hang, dwelt particularly on thecase of the dockyards, and he suggested that dockyard men, among others, shouldbe outside the scope of the Bill. I remember that before the war, in 1912 and1913, when I was First Lord of the Admiralty, I increased the proportion of established men in the dockyards, greatly to the satisfaction of the dockyards, butnot entirely to the satisfaction of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in those days.I made that increase with what object? With the express object that we shouldhave a solid body of men in the dockyards upon whom we could count in all circumstances, no matter what labour disputes might be in progress, for thenecessary upkeep and running repairs of the fighting fleet. Supposing that wewere going to make exceptions in this clause, if there were any class who shouldnot be excluded from the scope of such a clause, it would be the class for which special exception is now asked. The whole-object of that high proportion of established men in the dockyards is to make quite sure that, whatever happens,the main safeguard of the country will not be affected by some temporary internaldomestic dispute on an altogether inferior plane to that of the safety of thecountry.I have heard some remarks in the debates already which seem to suggestthat civil servants who occupy permanent pensionable positions have to suffer verymuch through having no means whereby they can voice their grievances. If,however, there be any class of employees from one end of this country to the otherwho have effective means of voicing their grievances, or who do effectively voicetheir grievances, it is the civil servants. This is not the time for us to discussthe question of Whitley Councils, which has been mentioned; this is not the timeto discuss the subject of the resort to arbitration. All these matters are unafftcted by the Bill. They have nothing whatever to do with the Bill. The Bill does nottouch them in any respect, and Parliament can at any time-either now, next year,the year after, or at any time devote careful attention to the question of the relationship between the State and its civil servants, and can devote careful attention to the machinery whereby grievances and disputed matters are adjusted.We close no doors upon any improvements that may be effected in themachinery-Mr. Duncan: You cannot close any doors.Mr Churchill: I say we close no such doors by this Bill. After all. when I amtold that civil servants will have absolutely no means of voicing their grievancesafter this Bill is passed, I am bound to say, first of all, that every civil servanthas the right of appealing to the ministerial head of his Department.Associations of civil servants are entitled to bring forward, and to be heard inregard to, any questions arising out of the conditions of service of those whobelong to them. Throughout the Service there is a complete network of WhitleyCouncils, at the centre there is a National Whitley Council, and, above and beyond all that, the Government have accepted the principle of compulsory arbitration with regard to the Civil Service. For instance, an arbitration claimmay be proceeding in regard to the Post Office, which would add  6,000,000 or 7,000,000 to the annual budget, affording hon. Gentleman opposite anotherreason for abusing me for allowing the expenditure of the country to increase.The Government take up the general position that if an arbitration goes against them, they will come forward and use their powers to present the measure tothe House of Commons. I agree that this is a matter which must be considered in relation to all the circumstances of each particular case, but this resort to compulsory arbitration, and the acceptance of the principle by the Government, iscertainly a most tremendous provision.Quite apart from that, civil servants have effective means of bringing their influence to bear upon Members of Parliament, both in the lobbies of this house and in their constituences, and those means are not affected in any way by this bill. . It has always been understood in the Service that it is wrong for a civil servant to approach his Member, or any Member, of Parliament, about his ownparticular case; that has always been considered to be contrary to the traditions of the Service; but there is not the slightest reason why any civil servant in anyMember&apos;s constituency should not approach that Member about the interests ofhis class of the Civil Service, or of the Civil Service as a whole, and, judging froma number of amendments which appear on the paper, they have shown noindisposition to avail themselves of that privilege. Civil servants are, of course,expected not to take a prominent part individually in politics -they are not expected to sit on platforms, or to deliver speeches from the tails of wagons, or
to attend large demonstrations in favour of particular parties or particularcandidates; but they have their influence as citizens, and they are not hamperedin any way in the slightest degree, either before or after this Bill, in the exerciseof their reasonable influence as citizens. But there is an element of discretionwhich has always been required of civil servants, and I was very glad to hearfrom some of their leaders, when they came to me in deputation, that they fully recognise that that element of discretion must govern the actions of civil servants,even as individuals, in regard to political matters. It would be a scandal if wehad members of the Civil Service taking a prominent part in controversial politics.I agree entirely that that line has been observed with peculiar skill, and with apeculiarly British common sense and spirit of compromise. It is not a line whichwe can draw absolutely clear-cut, because this is a question of what is proper,,and in our rough-and-ready island manner we usually manage to arrive at a good and harmonious procedure in regard to these matters. All that is going on at thepresent time in the ordinary life of the Civil Service that is my point willbe able to go on after this Bill has been passed into law. I think it is a completedelusion to suggest that the Civil Service of this country will either feel themselveshampered in putting forward their views after the passing of this Bill or thatthey have not ample and convenient methods for the expression of their views to the Government. The hon. Member for North Camberwell asked metwelve questions, and I will answer all those questions, of which he has given menotice. He asked : &quot; Will the Civil Service organisations be consulted withregard to the proposed Regulations, and will the Civil Service Regulationsconcerning political activities, now in force, be revised 1&apos;&apos; The answer is : &quot; Wedo not intend to refer the Regulations under this clause to Civil Serviceorganisations. These Regulations will not involve any revision of the existingCivil Service Regulations concerning political activities.&quot; The second questionis : &quot; When will the Regulations be issued ? Will they be laid on the table ofthe House before they are put into force ?&apos;&apos; The answer is : &quot; The regulations will be issued as soon as possible after the Bill becomes law. In order that parliament may be aware of their provisions, we are quite content that they shallbe laid upon the table of the House.&quot; I give that definite assurance. We cannotsay that they will be laid in draft, but that Parliament shall be fully informed of what is going on and shall be seized formally and officially of the Regulations,we consider entirely proper, and I take this opportunity of saying that thatwill be done.  .Mr. A mmon: Shall we have an opportunity of discussing them in the House mr. Churchill: How can the hon. Gentleman use that argument&apos;? Thevarious Members of the official Opposition have the right to choose the subjectsfor discussion on every Supply day, quite apart from all the other oppertuinities which are afforded by parliamentary procedure. It is farcical to suggest thatif the official Opposition wished to discuss this matter, they would not get time inwhich to do so. Many hon. Members, composing the large majority, and who sit on this side of the House, have felt a sense of grievance because they are neverable to choose the subject of discussion on any Supply day. The object ofparliamentary procedure has been to give every facility to the Opposition, and ofthat special privilege and advantage the hon. Gentleman and his leaders will beable to avail themselves to the utmost.     - .The third question is: &quot; Will the Government allow time for the organisations to recast their rules and constitution and make other necessary amendments arising out of the new legislation?&quot; The answer is : &quot; Yes, theGovernment propose that the regulations to be made under clause 5 should take effect from the 1st January, 1928.  That will give ample time for any changes.&quot;The hon. Gentleman then asks : &quot; Will provisions be made for an appeal toan independent arbitrator to be heard before civil servants are dismissed underthe provisions of this Bill?&quot;   The answer to that is : &quot; Certainly not.&quot;Mr. J. Jones: You will be dismissed before then.Mr. Churchill: A.&quot;hopeful disposition..is..not,-the.sole qualification to be aprophet.   The hon. Gentleman has asked me about the regulations &quot;in respect to&quot;The Whitley Council.   We are not touching that in this Bill at all.   That will bea matter for discussion in Parliament on any other occasion.Then the hon Member asks me: &quot; Will civil servants be permitted to seek the assistance of Members of Parliament on questions of pay and conditions ofservice?&quot; The answer is: &quot;They are perfectly free to do so except on their personal claims.&quot;[25629] - &apos; b 2
The next question is : &quot; Will civil servants be eligible to stand for election to municipal authorities under the auspices of a political party?&quot; The answer is that that is already dealt with by the departmental regulations and it is not affected by this clause. In some cases they are permitted to do so now, and in others it would be inappropriate. It would be inappropriate, for instance, for officials of the Ministry of Health to stand for election on local authorities, andit might well be inappropriate for members of the Excise Department to stand for election on local public bodies.Mr. J. Jones: On a point of order. Is the right hon. Gentleman not aware that a large number of officials are&apos;already members of such bodies?The Chairman: That is really not a point of order.Mr. Churchill: The rule at present is that various Departments concernedexercise a discretionary power.Mr. Jones: Will they be allowed to do so in future?Mr. Churchill: Certainly there will be no change in this respect. Then the hon. Member for North Camberwell asks me whether individual membership ofpolitical parties will be permitted. Of course, there is no reason why a civil servant should not be a Socialist, or a Conservative, or a Liberal in his individualcapacity, but that is governed by the general principle of his not taking a prominent part in politics.Mr. Jones: You have not answered the question.The Chairman: I must ask the hon Member to refrain from interrupting.Mr. Jones: We have had enough of this kind of thing.The Chairman: I must ask the hon. Gentleman to listen and not to interrupt.Mr. Churchill: The hon. Gentleman (Mr. Ammon) then asked me a question in which-a great many of his constituents, in the larger sense, are interested. Iam going to give a clear answer to this point, because I am very anxious that thereshould be no misunderstanding.The question is: &quot; Will civil servants be permitted to form politicalorganisations within the Civil Service? &quot;   The answer is &quot; No.&quot;The next question is : &quot; Will civil servants&apos; organisations be entitled toaffiliate themselves to the Post Office Workers&apos; International and the CivilService International?&quot; The answer is: &quot;If these organisations are politicalorganisations, or if their prime object is to influence or affect the remuneration and conditions of service of the members of their constituent element, the answer is that affiliation would not not be allowed. Each case must be judged on its merits.Now I come to the last question of which the hon. Gentleman has given menotice. It is in these terms : &quot; Can Civil Service associations affiliate to theWorkers&apos; Educational Trade Union Committee?&quot; The answer is: &quot;If the objects of this body are simply educational, there is nothing in clause 5 to preventaffiliation. If the committee referred to is a political organisation, or if its primeobject is to influence or affect the remuneration and conditions of service of its members, the answer is tha.t affiliation would not be allowed.&quot;There remains the thirteenth question which the hon. Gentleman asked me,namely, whether a body of civil servants would be entitled to band themselvestogether to subscribe for the maintenance of a Member of Parliament, or morethan one Member of Parliament? Of course, it is no part of my business toexplain any loopholes that there may be in the Government legislation on thispoint. Our legislation must conform to the following principles : First, that civil servants must not take collective political action. Secondly, we hold very strongly to the view that a Member of Parliament ought to represent a constituency. If the House of Commons is to preserve its historic character, andmeet the many dangers that menace it and that menace all parliamentaryinstitutions, I am sure that the less we have of Members representing particular interests, or particular groups, and the more we have of Members who come hereto represent the Commons of Britain, the better, more efficient and more respectedour parliamentary institutions will be. Subject to those general observations,nothing in clause 5 prevents any Civil Service union from having a secretaryChosen from outside the Civil Service, and from paying to that secretary any salarythat they think fit. Nothing prevents that secretary spending that salary in anyway he likes, and if he chooses to devote a part&quot; of it to obtaining the privileges
and pleasures of Membership of this House, nothing in clause 5 will in the slightest degree obstruct his ambition.I have now dealt with all the questions which were asked me by the hon.Member, and I will only address myself, before sitting down, to the somewhatcontroversial topic of why this clause should be included in the present Bill.I am asked why it is necessary to make a change by legislation in the rules whichhave hitherto governed the Civil Service. A great many things have changedwithin the last few years, and there is no doubt whatever that on general principles the Civil Service trade unions ought not to be affiliated to outsideunions. Nevertheless, for a great many years this has continued, and has notbeen much troubled about; but the increasing politicalisation of the trade unions and their increasing intermixture with controversial party politics, has emphasised the position, and for some years there has been a great deal of anxietynot only outside the Civil Service but amongst very powerful sections inside theCivil Service at the increasing extent to which civil servants seem to be associatedWith controversial party politics, and identify themselves with the fortunes ofone particular political party. Those civil servants have an absolute right to be identified as such in their individual capacity as citizens, but we cannot allow theCivil Service of this country to be drawn into the party arena, because that wouldbe fatal to the Civil Service.Among my advisers are men of the highest ability who may be Socialists intheir opinions, or Conservative, or Liberal, in their private opinions, and theyare men about whom in this connection their departmental chief would neverthink of inquiring, because he knows they will faithfully discharge their duty to the Government in office or the Government which comes into office. But if weare going to have party politics introduced into the Civil Service and organisedaction deliberately taken by civil servants, not to push their own particular interests, but to sway national and political issues, then you will introduce thatsort of poison that has discredited the Civil Service of some important countries , I am not going to mention names, but some of them are very unpopular amongsthon. Members opposite, and some of them are very popular. The result of sucha policy would be that those who got into power would employ around them agentswho share their own political and party views, and that would be absolutely fatal to the whole traditions of the Civil Service.I agree with what has been said by the hon. Member opposite about the CivilService and the general strike, and I would like to point out that out of220,000 established civil servants, I think only 40 were guilty of activelyparticipating in the strike. Therefore, we are not dealing with evils which have yet come into the field of practical politics to any great extent. Nevertheless, weare legislating in good time before that impartial loyalty which is now given toall parties has been perverted and a situation created where each party has itsown friends and favourites and enemies in the Civil Service. We are legislatingin good time, but it is high time. We have been told what occurred a year ago.There is no doubt whatever that the fact that these Civil Service associations wereaffiliated to the Trade Unions Congress was used by the leaders to influence thecivil servants. It was used in the sense of saying : &quot; We must be mindful ofour obligations towards the Trade Unions Congress.&quot; It is quite true that theywere not actually called upon to strike, and it is pretty clear that if they hadbeen, that call would . have been refused by an overwhelming majority.Nevertheless, we do not know what is in store for us. We do know that, accordingto a circular issued on the 4th May last year by the Association of Officers of taxes, at a session of the Trade Unions Congress held on Saturday, the 1st May,the general secretaries of all affiliated trade unions were called upon to givepublic replies to two questions. The first was, whether the association was prepared to place the power in the hands&apos;of the General Council as regards callinga strike of its members; and, secondly, financial aid. The reply given on behalfof the Association of Officers of Taxes was to the effect that the Association hadno provision in its constitution for the withdrawal of labour, but that asub-committee of the executive committee was prepared to recommend theexecutive committee to give financial assistance, not to relieve the people sufferingdistress, but to give assistance to the trade union committee in actually fighting the strike.The circular of the Association of Officers of Taxes goes on to state that theCivil Service Clerical Association, the Association of Civil Service SortingAssistants and the Union of Post Office Workers gave an affirmative reply to both those questions. I agree that they did not in fact join in the strike, but what aposition the State would have been placed in if they had been called upon to carry
out the obligations into which they had entered. Here they had their obligations to the Trade Unions Congress, and civil servants ought not to be put into a positionof divided allegiance, or into a position in which they can be asked questions of thekind which were put to them a year ago. It is perfectly clear that, while you would endanger the Civil Service if it became affected with the virus of party politics, it would also endanger the State to an extent which you can hardlymeasure if it were to be suggested that the established permanent pensionablecivil servants, on whom we rely for the maintenance of the public services, couldsuddenly have their loyalty perverted or allegiance withdrawn. We could not tolerate that, and it is far better for the civil servant, before any lamentableincident has occurred and before any disaster has occurred to the Civil Service ofthis country, to make it perfectly clear that the obligations of an established civil servant in his capacity as a civil servant is whole-heartedly to the State, and thatno outside interference can be tolerated.I will read a quotation from a speech to show the Committee, not what civilservants had assented to, but the kind of temptation and evil counsels to whichthey might be subjected. I will quote from a speech which was made by one of theleaders of the Civil Service Trade Unions, Mr. Brown. It is only fair, before Igive this quotation, that I should say, when I quoted it to Mr. Brown in his presence, he said it was a garbled report, but he did not furnish any alternativeversion of what he said, and we all know how trouble sometimes arises between public speakers and reporters, and there is a general feeling that the publicspeaker is not always in the right in these matters. At any rate, this, or some-thing like it, is what he is reported to have said by the Manchester Guardian,which, I am sure, would be the last paper to misrepresent his views. This is what mr. Brown said at Woolwich on the 20th February, 1927 : &quot; Whether the last general strike was an industrial failure or not, it was an enormous political success, and had brought appreciably nearer the timewhen the weapon of the general strike would be used to prevent war. - TheGovernment, he thought, realised this, and feared the incidence of a general strike in the military Departments in the event of another war.&quot;Mr. Kirkwood: Surely you know that is true.Mr. Churchill: I am justifying the Government for inserting clause 5 in this bill. Here you have a most dangerous claim put forward by a man who is veryprominent and active in the counsels of the Civil Service Trade Unions. Here isa claim that an extensive number of persons of no representative responsibilityhave a right to gather together in committees or conclaves and decide over the headof Parliament, and apart from the Government of the day and the House ofCommons on which it rests, whether in fact this or that great act of policy shouldbe done. It is a deliberate attempt to substitute, the &quot;power of external bodies,wholly wihout competence, for the representative authority of this House, and ofthe Government responsible to it. For instance, according to this doctrine which mr. Brown put forward, if he had his way with the unions of civil servants, he andhis friends would have been entitled to have formed their own opinion in regardto the sending of troops to Shanghai, as to whether or not the necessary order should be transmitted from the Government and. as to whether that order shouldbe cairied out.   [Interruption.&apos;]Mr. Lansbury: Read the Sunday Times.Mr. Churchill: It is very unusual for the hon. Gentleman to take refuge inobscurity.- Mr. Lansbury: The right hon. Gentleman has no right to charge me withcowardice or with doing things in obscurity. I ask him to read the late Sir henry wilson&apos;s biography in the Sunday Times which has proved that military men haveshown the workers exactly where their&apos; devoted allegiance will lead them.[Interruption. ]The Chairman: The right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Exchequergave way to the hon. Member for Bow and Bromley (Mr. Lansbury), and I must ask hon. Members to allow the. Chancellor of the Exchequer to proceed with hisargument.Mr. Kirkwood: Our interruptions are perfectly in order, and Members oppo-site have no right to shout &quot; Order, order !,&apos;.&apos; My point is that our interruptionsare perfectly parliamentary, and people have no right to shout &quot; Order &quot; at us when we rise
The Chairman: I would point out to the hon. Member that continuousinterruption--Mr. Kirkwood: They were not continuous. [Hon Members: &quot;Order! &quot;]But they can be continuous if there is any more of that.The Chairman: I was about to point out to the hon. Member that no inter-ruption is parliamentary if it is so continuous as to prevent the hon Member whois in possession from delivering his argument.Mr. Churchill: I had practically finished my argument.Mr. J. Jones: You never began an argument yet on this question.Mr. Churchill: I never charged the hon Member for Bow and Bromley(Mr. Lansbury) with being cowardly. On the contrary, I said it was veryunusual to see him taking refuge in obscurity, when his natural bent is to seekpublicity in its most extravagant form.Mr. Kirkwood: We accept the apology.Mr. Churchill: To conclude the observations which I venture to address to theCommittee on this matter and to sum them up, I would say that we are acting so asto prevent a change taking place in the character of our Civil Service which wouldbe detrimental to all parties and to every party. We are doing so, I believe, insuch a way as not to injure or inconvenience the mass of civil servants or to deprive them in any way of the real means of representing gievances on which theyrely, or of the protection of Parliament which is their greatest assurance. We are doing this in order to safeguard their reputation, to prevent them from being putinto a position of divided loyalty and to make sure, at all events, that the Govern-ment can take effective action in any crisis at home or abroad which it may feelnecessary for the safety of the country and for which it has the plenary authorityof Parliament.
