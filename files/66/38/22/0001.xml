(43) 272.2%th June, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY/ - -jIt is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy o?f this document war CABINET.MAN-POWER REQUIREMENTS OF THE ARMY FROM 1st JUNE,1943.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War.1. The basis for the Army requirements remains as set out in Misc. 36 (42) lrin which a demand for 1943 for 441,000 men and 110,000 women was put forward.This demand was cut by the Minister of Defence (W.P. (42) 556 of. the28th November, 1942) by 300,000 men and 80,000 women.2. The actual intake of men allowed for 1943, after adding a balance of13,000 still due from 1942, was 154,000, of which 125,000 were to be providedbetween January and May.  The position was to be reviewed before May.3. In Part II of W.P. (42) 570 it was stated that a saving of 150,000 men might be found towards the cut of (the equivalent of) 364,000 men. In the event it is now proposed to count on saving 200,000 men on certain assumptions.4.   The most important of these assumptions are :-(i) that the B.E.F. will only need to be produced at full establishmentsd3ythe 1st April, 1944, and(ii) that the wastage rates could be taken at- ,Normal   ...       ...       ...      9,000 a,monthBattle     ......      ...      6,000 a month the first of these figures is based on the actual experience of the; last14 months and the second is based in the actual casualties of the First and EighthArmies between October 1942 and early April 1943. The second figure isprobably too low for future experience and it. would be safer to take it as9,000 a month.   However, for the present it is assumed to be 6,000.    .^ h5. Taking into account these savings plus certain changes (such as theproposed addition of 36 men to the Infantry Battalion and the creation ofBrigade Support Croups) and allowing for (i) intakes of 25,000 a month for thefirst five months of 1943 and of 4,000 a month for the rest, of the year and(ii) the output from the training centres up to the 1st April, 1944, the deficit intrained effectives on that date will be 74,000. Moreover, the training establish-ments will have been almost completely cleared out.6. To fill the gap, the absolute minimum required is that the intakes shouldbe increased so as to provide an extra 74,000 trained men by the 1st April, 1944,and each month thereafter 15,000 trained men to balance the minimum monthlywastage figure. This result can just be produced by prolonging the monthlyintakes of 25,000 for the four months June to September inclusive and byassigning a steady monthly intake of 15,000 thereafter.[25631]   &quot;
It is very desirable, however, that an entry of 25,000 should also be allocatedin the month of October in order to give some margin against contingencies suchas greater battle wastage and to give time for a further review of the positionin the light of experience.7. If these intakes are not possible, or if the allowance for battle wastagehas been pitched too low, a reduction in the number of formations becomesinevitable, and once it is clear that it is inevitable the sooner it takes place the better.8. A substantial number of men are still serving in lieu of women owingto the cut in the allocation of the latter. The Army could absorb and place, from june onwards, 1,200 women per week, and this would help to improve the position regarding men and offset to some extent certain factors mentioned below. Butthe replacement of men by women yields a very small proportion of fit men, mostof whom have already been combed out from positions in which women can beplaced.   Moreover, the normal monthly wastage of women is 1,600.9. No account has been taken of the following factors which will inevitablyaffect our ability to make available trained men by the dates required for thevarious Army commitments : (a) The dead loss figure of 9,000 per month now assumed for normal wastagetakes no account of the continuous drain on fighting arms throughmedical down-gradings and unsuitability in battle training. these have to&apos; be replaced immediately by fit men, and the reabsorption ofthe men displaced takes some. time. This drain averages 3,000 per month.(b) The saving from home commitments only yields men over a considerable period. These have to be retrained, and many are not suitable for medical or other reasons to fill the new role required of them.(c) The Army is no longer capable of producing many men for tradesmen.A high proportion of the intakes have therefore to be put towardsproviding the technical units required for the Expeditionary Force,leaving an insufficient number to meet wastage in the fighting arms.This wastage has, therefore, to be covered by drawing on the homeand Expeditionary Force divisions for some time to come.(d) The despatch overseas of over one million men has resulted in a steadily increasing proportion of the lower medical categories in the total athome. Yet it is from home that we have to find the fit men tomaintain our overseas armies and to build up the B.E.F.; and theposition is becoming increasingly difficult.Summary of Requirements.10. The immediate minimum intakes required, until a further review can bemade in October 1943 are therefore : Men (June to October inclusive)   ......      25,000 per month.Women (June to October inclusive) ...        1,200 per week.and thereafter a minimum of 15,000 men and 1,600 women a month.P.
