Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.secret.P. (43) 259.22nd June, 1943.WAR CABINET.POST-WAR CIVIL AIR TRANSPORT.Memorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Air.I circulate herewith, by direction of the Prime Minister, a Note onAnnex &quot; C &quot; to the Memorandum by the Minister without Portfolio of the18th June (W.P. (43) 251).H. H. BALFOUR.Air Ministry,22nd June, 1943.NOTE.There are three points arising on Annex &quot; C &quot; to the Memorandum by theMinister without Portfolio, to which I should draw attention.Freedom of the A ir.In my view, we should be making a tactical mistake if we put forward theproposals in paragraph 4 for a greater measure of &quot; freedom of the air,&quot; without making it clear that they are. conditional upon the general acceptance of anenlightened international settlement, such as that proposed in Annex &quot; C.&quot;If this is not done, &quot; freedom of the air &quot; might come up and be settled at theforthcoming talks with the United States and. the Dominions as a separate and self-contained issue. This would suit the Americans very well. We, on the otherhand, should have played our trump card, i.e., the control of bases, without any kind of assurance that the Americans were prepared to accept our other proposals.The point is the more important because there have been signs that the americans may argue that we should throw in the use of bases in exchange forthe gift of transport aircraft after the war. I submit that this is an argument which we cannot accept. The United States owe us many times over any numberof transport aircraft that they may give us. The exchange is not bases for aircraft, but bases for progressive and constructive collaboration all round.Rate Fixing.Paragraph 8 suggests that agreement on rates, frequencies, &amp;c, might beleft to the Conference of the operating agencies, subject to arbitration (probably by the International x\uthority) in cases of dispute on rate-cutting, &amp;c. I do not feel that this is adequate.Thus, the Operators&apos; Conference might agree among themselves on rates which would fleece the travelling public, or, relying on State subsidies, they mightfix such low freight charges and passenger rates that traffic which ought properlyto go by surface transport would be unfairly attracted.Again, on frequencies, the founder-members of the operators&apos; conference might refuse to give a square deal to newcomers, or might in other ways adoptan unduly rigid policy which would screen the inefficient operator and check that.[25608]Copy No.
organic development, based ,on ^efficiency, whicb,.,is ...yitai.,to this young andbuoyant industry.I suggest that any agreement on rates, frequencies, &amp;c, which may be reached by the operators&apos; Conference should be subject to endorsement by the international authority. -,       .San,actions.As I read Annex &quot; C,&quot; the sanction behind the decisions of the operators,&apos;Conference and of the International Authority will be that each State will licenseits own operating agency (or agencies), and will pledge itself only to license thoseagencies which undertake to observe the.&quot;Convention. Accordingly, if an airlineignored the rules, the State concerned would be expected to withdraw its licenceBut if the State Lacked the will or the power to do this, the other participatingStates must surely seek their own remedy and deny facilities to the airlineconcerned, otherwise the whole system would collapse. It would be as well tj*introduce a sentence to cover this point.H. H. B.
