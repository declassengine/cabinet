Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1943.Copy No.WAR CABINET.   jPOST-WAR SETTLEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.- I-THE paper circulated by the Prime Minister (W.P, (43) 233) is particularlyvaluable in that it seems to show that the Prime Minister was successful ininducing prominent Americans, and notably Mr. Sumner Welles, to agree on thedesirability of the United States, together with her three major Allies, signingtwo protocols during the war, the first laying down the joint responsibility ofthe four major Powers in keeping the peace, and the second declaring that theywould agree to co-operate in its preservation. If we can get anything like thispassed by the United States Senate it will be of immense significance and a goodaugury for the peace of the world. .2. The Prime Minister is also, I think, to be congratulated on persuadinghis American hearers to agree to a Supreme World Council consisting of theFour Powers, plus certain other members to be selected by various Regions. and here I feel that we ought to accept generally Mr. Sumner Welles&apos;s elaboration ofthese proposals contained in. Lord Halifax&apos;s telegram No. 2688 (see Annex).More especially would it be to our advantage if (as proposed by Mr. Welles) one member of the British Commonwealth of Nations other than the United Kingdom.had a permanent seat on the Council. I am certain, too, that action of theSupreme World Council should, as Mr. Welles suggests, be dependent onunanimity between the Four Great Powers. Clearly, one of the main functionsof any world political machinery we may establish after the war will be toharmonise the policies of the British Commonwealth, the United States, the soviet union and China, if China really develops into a Great Power, which remains tobe seen. Unless, indeed, we get unanimity between at any rate the three great powers, no machine will work.3. I further strongly endorse the following points made by the PrimeMinister : (i) The necessity for a strong France;(ii) Proposals for some kind of joint Anglo-American citizenship;(iii) The desirability of our &quot; pooling&quot; bases at any. rate with the UnitedStates;(iv) Learning from the experience of the League of Nations;(v) The desirability of the national forces of any country being put at thedisposal of the Regional Councils, under the direction of the SupremeWorld Council, for the purpose of combating aggression.At the same time, there are a few points of detail in the new proposals inregard to which I confess to entertaining doubts. These I summarise asfollows :  -1. I see certain difficulties in Mr. Welles&apos;s suggestion that certain membersof the Supreme World Council should be selected from a panel of accepted names.In the first place, I am not clear whether this method of selection applies to(6) only, or whether it applies also to (c), (d) and (e) (see Lord Halifax&apos;s telegramNo. 2688). Next, I do not know how names are to be &quot; accepted.&quot; Who is to12093   [25684],.&apos; bSECRET.W.P. (43) 292.1st July, 1943.
certificate the candidates, and how ? And on the general principle, while I agreethat, ideally, it would be best to choose from an elite of individuals particularlysuited to discharge these high functions, we must remember that we have had some experience of this, and it does not always work out as. intended. Forinstance,.the Judges of the Permanent Court were supposed to be chosen for their personal eminence and integrity. In point of fact there was as much nationalisticand political lobbying round the election to the Court as there was on any otherGeneva occasion.Moreover, I think that it is very likely that, if we really succeed in restoring the greatness of France, which is declared to be our object, she will demand apermanent seat of her own on the Council, and we might find it difficult, even ifwe wished, to resist this demand.2. But it is more particularly in regard to Europe that there are certain difficulties that require further consideration.(a) So far as Germany, is concerned, it seems to be implied that we shoulddivide it into two halves, one roughly north of the Main and the other south of it.With this southern section Austria should be encouraged to associate herself.The North Germans or &quot; Prussians &quot; should, it seems, be treated severely and theSouth Germans relatively well.I fear that there is no real reason to suppose that the Nazi virus is confined to North Germany or to &quot; Prussia.&quot; The headquarters of the Nazi Party is, after all, in Munich. Nuremberg is the centre for the tribal rites, and one of the worst of the German Gauleiters, Streicher, himself a South German, used to brutalisethe population of Franconia. Moreover, the Germans north of the Main are by nomeans all geographical, still less ethnic, Prussians. Prussia as a geographicalentity extends from Aachen eastwards to the Polish frontier, but there are con-siderable enclaves in the shape of Mecklenburg, Hanover, Thuringia and Saxony.There are many million Catholic Rhinelanders in geographical Prussia and manyWest Germans, also to a large extent Catholic, who are the reverse of the conven-tional Prussian type.But, quite apart from these facts, we cannot get over the circumstance thatthe bulk of German industry would be in North Germany and that as soon as anyAllied occupation ceased there would be an almost-irresistible urge to reunify the reich. If this took place and if Austria was then associated with South Germany,Austria would fall into the German maw, and we would get the GrossdeutschesReich of 1937, and the position of Czechoslovakia would again become precariousin the extreme. There would be an even greater likelihood of creating such a situation if, as is suggested elsewhere, Hungary, and even Roumania, bothex-enemy States, were associated with a South German Federation. Indeed, sucha set-up would seem to ensure German economic predominance in South-eastern europe and there would, as I see it, be hardly any chance of our inducing our european Allies, to say nothing of Soviet Russia, to accept it as a suitable basis for a European settlement.For these reasons I should prefer to see Austria associated with Czecho-slovakia and maybe Hungary and Yugoslavia in a Danube Federation. I havespoken to Dr. Benes on this subject and he seems very ready to consider closer association between Czechoslovakia and Austria than existed before the present war. He maintains that at the time when Dollfuss was murdered there was an offer from Dr. Benes to him on his table offering close association between thecountries and he says he would be willing to make .such an offer again, butthat the first step to this end is Austrian independence., My ideas on this subjecthave been further developed in my paper &quot; Austria,&quot; W.P. (43) 218, recentlybefore the Cabinet.(b) The other Confederations proposed will be valuable if they can berealised, but the chances of their maturing are slight.(i)&apos; So far as the Balkans are concerned, we are doing our best toencourage the Greco-Yugoslav confederation, but it is difficult tomake much progress in this direction while the Governments of thesecountries are exiled and we cannot say what the position will, bewhen the Axis collapses. Much will depend on whether we ourselvesare in occupation of that area,(ii) The difficulties attending the Polish-Czech confederation are knownto all my colleagues. At the moment the prospects are bleak, and inany event discussion of this problem can have little meaning unless&apos; and until we can improve the relations of Soviet Russia with Poland.
(iii) A Scandinavian confederation might conceivably come, about, but I doubt whether the Soviets would allow Finland to join it and relationsbetween Norway and Sweden are at the moment bad.(iv) Holland and Belgium might, I suppose, come together, though I should regard this as most unlikely. Both look now more than ever towards us, and neither, at present at any rate, wish to be closely associatedwith France. Still less is Denmark likely to agree to associate herselfwith them rather than with her northern neighbours.(v) Spain and Italy I frankly do not see coming together in any circum-stances. There is immense latent animosity between these two nations and it is quite possible that after this war they will have different kinds of regimes. At any rate it is not evident what part Portugalcould play in such an arrangement.(vi) Finally,- we must remember that any Balkan bloc that included Ttirkeymight arouse the suspicions of the Soviet Government. None the less the Balkan League was founded on Greco-Turkish rapprochement.and I continue to regard this as the only solid basis for the structure. &apos;(c) In pointing out these difficulties I continue none the less to believe thatwe must work towards confederations in Europe. Such associations must beessentially spontaneous, though we should encourage them by all means. Theyare unlikely to come about except under pressure of fear of aggression. I assume that even after an &quot; unconditional surrender &quot; of Germany there will be fear ofrenewed German aggression in the twenty or thirty years that succeed this war.It is on this assumption that we have to draw up our plans. It may be, of course,that after this war is over the fear of Russian aggression may be uppermost, butwe cannot plan on that assumption now.3. On a more general point, I feel there is perhaps insufficient emphasis inthe present proposals on the cardinal necessity of the United Kingdom, theUnited States and Soviet Russia working together if peace is to be preserved.To this end I should myself welcome some suggestion to the effect that one of themain functions of the World Council, if established, would be to iron out any difficulties that may arise between the Great Powers themselves and perhap seven more important to reach agreement, as soon as may be, on their respectiverights and obligations, and, aims, during the &apos;&apos; tutelary period &apos;&apos; when they will assume the duty of policing and reconstructing the Continent.4. While I agree that in principle the various nations should make their forces available to act as part of an International Police Force, I am not at allcertain that we could get agreement as to &quot; minimum and maximum armed forces,&quot; at any rate immediately after the war. Nor do I think that the principleof the &apos;&apos; two contingents &apos;&apos; is one on which we could get other States, and notably the Russians, to agree. The whole question of armaments is enormously compli-cated and difficult and is bound up with that of security systems. It is goingto be a very difficult matter to decide, for instance, on the amount of armamentsfor our smaller Exiropean allies, and it seems to me that it can only be settledsatisfactorily by&apos;giving them some definite role to play in a security system andby so far as possible integrating their national forces with those of the great powers with whom they are most nearly associated. The whole conception. of&quot; security systems &apos;&apos; needs to be thought out in consultation with our military advisers.5. The Dominions aspect is naturally one on which the Dominions secretary will no doubt be circulating a paper; but at first glance it seems to me to be unlikely that the Canadians will wish to join the Pan-American Union.i&apos;    HI.      &apos; - :It will be seen that my major doubts relate to the suggestions for thereoonstitution of Europe. Whether they are valid or not, I am sure that weshould do well not to raise contentious European issues in any scheme for a world organisation which we, in conjunction with our major Allies, may decide on andpublish before the conclusion of hostilities. - It will be difficult enough to getinter-allied agreement on the various important and urgent questions connectedwith the armistice; and it would probably, therefore, so far as Europe isconcerned, be more practical to work towards the United Nations Commission
for Europe, which the Cabinet have agreed I should suggest to the American and soviet Ambassadors. If we can get agreement on that, then we shall have gonesome way towards reorganising Europe on the lines that may seem best in thelight of circumstances as yet unknown.I remain, however, convinced that we should aim at some plan such as thePrime Minister has indicated in broad. outline. I am therefore circulatinganother paper of my own in which an attempt is made to see the picture as awhole. The substance of this paper, which embodies the Prime Ministers majorproposals, might possibly, if the Cabinet agree, be communicated to the americans and the Russians after the Dominions have had their say. It replaces the originalUnited Nations Plan (W.P. (43) 31), which, as I stated at the time, was to beregarded as a preliminary indication of the way my mind was working.A. E.Foreign Office, 1st July, 1943.-   . ANNEX.Viscount Halifax to Mr. Eden.(No. 2688.   Most Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, 10th June, 1943.PERSONAL for yourself and the Prime Minister.Sumner Welles dined two nights ago to meet Law and we had a long and very frank talk. He reverted to the questions discussed at the Prime Ministersluncheon, of which I sent you record,^) concerning the possibility of-getting thefour major Powers and all the United Nations to bind themselves by suitableprotocols to take action for post-war security system. He again emphasised his view of the urgency, partly for reasons previously stated, of greater promise of getting this sort of thing through while the war was on and also for the reasonof taking advantage of the present good atmosphere with the Soviets. Hedeveloped his ideas of supreme world council and regional councils in greater detail than he had done to the Prime Minister, and hoped to be able to get the presidents approval of his plans so that he could let us have it all on paper.Shortly, his idea for the composition of the supreme world council is (a) four major Powers^(b) two members elected by European and American regional councilsrespectively from panel of accepted names;(c) one elected by the Pacific regional council;(d) one elected by Middle East and North African independent countries;(e) one elected by the British Commonwealth of Nations.Eleven in all.2. He would make it a condition of action by supreme world council thatthere should be unanimity between the four great Powers. This, in his view,would only be recognising realities but would also be valuable from the point ofview of United States opinion.3. He expressed strongly the view that we need not be greatly afraid ofUnited States public opinion seeking to pull out of responsibility for taking action at some later date on a commitment so assumed, if we got so far.American opinion would [group undecypherable] be unwilling to go back onengagements once made and also the feeling of responsibility for making a showthat was largely American work would pull more powerfully in the right direction.&quot;fr *X* 4f*0) See W.P.
