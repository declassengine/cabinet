WAR CABINET.THE ORGANISATION OF COMMAND IN EAST ASIA.Memorandum by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.THE vigorous and effective prosecution of large-scale operations against japan in East Asia and the rapid development of the air route through burma to China necessitate the reorganisation of the High Command in the Indiantheatre.2. The functions of supreme operational command combined with those ofWar Member of the Government of India and Commander-in-Chief, India,responsible for all military administration, training and internal security, are more than one man can discharge. I therefore propose that the statutorycommand in India and the operational command in East Asia shall be split andreorganised into two commands as follows :- Command in India.3. The administration of India as a base for the forces in East Asia willremain under the control of a statutory Commander-in-Chief, India, responsible to the Government of India and the Viceroy. Co-ordination of movement,maintenance of personnel and provision of stores and equipment to meet the needs,both of the operational forces based on India and of the internal garrison, canbe carried out efficiently only by one Staff responsible in the last resort to one authority with power to decide priorities.   This machinery exists to-day in the[25590] b----.------- ^MOST SECRET. Copy No.   8W.P.

Government of India and in G.H.Q., India. It is the only machinery which can carry out the dual tasks of meeting the internal requirements of India as wellas the requirements of operations in the East Asia theatre.Command in East Asia.4. From a study of the command systems in other theatres, particularly those where Allied as well as British forces are operating, I have reached theconclusion that the appointment of an Allied Supreme Commander-in-Chief,responsible for the conduct of operations against Japan in East Asia and for thedevelopment of the air route to China, is the best arrangement. Subordinateto the Supreme Allied Commander would be a Naval Commander, an ArmyCommander and an Air Commander.The Naval Commander would be subordinate to the Allied supreme commander in all matters connected with operations against Japan in East Asia,but in all matters connected with the control of sea communications in the indian ocean, both outside and inside the area of the East Asia Command, he will beresponsible to the Admiralty.5. I therefore propose that the commands in India and in East Asia shallbe organised as follows : A. The Commander-in-Chief, India, to be responsible for (i) Discipline, administration and training in conformity with the operational requirements of the Supreme Commander of theEast Asia front.(ii) Indian operational tasks such as internal order, the security ofthe North-West Frontier and that of the Indian coast line. and.frontiers outside the immediate area of the forces concernedin the East Asia operations.&apos; -* (iii) Control of the agencies necessary for the provision of personnel and material, assembly, despatch and maintenance of the forcesbased on India and for issue of executive orders in thisconnection, in accordance with the requirements of the supreme commander and for placing the necessary demands on UnitedKingdom, United States, India or pCP.O. Eastern GroupSupply Council for these forces.        CB. The Allied Supreme Command in East Asia to be set up as follows : (i) The Command and Staff to be a combined British and Americanone on the lines of the North Africa Command.(ii) The Supreme Commander, as India is an agreed British sphere of operations, to be British, with an American deputy. Heshould have under him Naval, Army and Air Commanders-in-Chief and also a Principal Administrative Officer to co-coordinate the planning of all three Services and of the Allied forces.
(iii) The Commanders of the three Services mentioned above, acting under the orders of the Supreme Commander, to control alloperations and have under their command such naval, militaryand air forces as may be assigned to the East Asia theatre fromtime to time.(iv) The Combined Administrative staffs of the three Services, con-trolled by a Principal Administrative Officer, to plan alladministrative requirements for operations, in concert withG.H.Q., India.Limits of the East A sia Command.6. I propose that the East Asia Command should be identical with the area at present allocated to the India Command, excepting India itself and territorywestward up to the present boundary with the Persia-Iraq Command. the boundaries are defined in Annex I. All operations in Burma, including thecontrol of Chinese forces operating in that country, and in the rest of the areadefined, will be under East Asia Command, and, for operational purposes, therewill be included in the Command of the Supreme Commander a zone of Assam and eastern Bengal, the limits of which will be fixed after consultation between theSupreme Commander and the Commander-in-Chief, India. This system of operational responsibility may be applied in other areas as necessary. The Com-mander of the United States Air Forces in China, however, must remain under theGeneralissimo.Establishment of the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander.7. The Headquarters of the East Asia Command should be formed inthe first instance at Delhi, since it will take over elements of the present general headquarters, India, e.g., the Planning Staff. But once it is formed it would bewell to get it out of Delhi, which is overcrowded, and where the supreme commander might tend to become absorbed with Indian problems. The supreme commander will submit his recommendations as to the ultimate location of his headquarters as soon as he has had time to study the problem.Division of Responsibilities in India and East Asia.8. The Commander-in-Chief, India, and his Staff will deal with problemsinternal to India, and will meet the requirements of the Supreme Commander,who must use India as a base. Both Commanders will have access to London,but, whereas the Commander-in-Chief, India, will only deal with internal security problems, the North-West Frontier, and administrative questions, theSupreme Allied Commander will deal with the broader strategical and operationalmatters arising out of the general war.9. Conflicts of opinion over priorities in connexion with administrationmust be anticipated.   It will, therefore, be necessary for someone on the spot to[25590] .   - b 2
resolve these differences day by day as they occur. From the constitutionalpoint of view this authority should be the Viceroy, acting on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, but his responsibilities are already so great that it willbe necessary to appoint under him an Assistant of Ministerial status with asuitable staff in order to settle on his behalf the day to day problems which arise between the Supreme Commander and the Indian authorities. This Minister willalso manage, under the Viceroy, the munitions plants and other kindredestablishments in India.10. Thus, the normal responsibilities within India of the Commander-in-Chief, India, are safeguarded; for operational purposes outside India,Commander-in-Chief, India, will meet the requirements of the supreme commander.Supreme Commanders Relations tvith Higher Authority.11. Following the MacArthur model, it is proposed that the combined chiefs of Staff should exercise general jurisdiction over grand strategic policyin the East Asia theatre and over such relating factors as are necessary for implementing this policy, including the allocation of forces and raw materials.The British Chiefs of Staff will exercise jurisdiction over all matters pertainingto operational strategy and all instructions to the Supreme Commander will beissued through them.12. Finally, I propose that the number of American agencies in India,such as the Office of Strategical Services (O.S.S.), the Office of War Information(O.W.I.), the Federal Communication Combine (F.C.C.) and the Bureau ofEconomic Warfare (B.E.W.), shall be taken into the orbit of the supreme commander. The integration with the corresponding British organisations willbe arranged in India.W. S. C.10 Bowning Street,21si June, 1943.Note.-A Summary of a Report by the Principal Administrative OfficersCommittee on the Administrative aspects of the proposed organisation is attached (Annex II).r
ANNEX I.Proposed Boundaries of East Asia Command.1. Eastern Boundary .*Prom the point where the frontier between China and Indo-China reaches theGulf of Tonkin, southwards along the coasts of Indo-China, Thailand and Malayato Singapore; from Singapore south to the North coast of Sumatra; thence round the East coast of Sumatra (leaving the Sunda Strait to the Eastward of the line)to a point on the coast of Sumatra at longitude 104 degrees East; thence South tolatitude 08 degrees South; thence South-Easterly towards Onslow, Australia, and,on reaching longitude 110 degrees East, due South along that meridian.2. Northern Boundary. .From the point where the frontier between China and Indo-China reachesthe Gulf of Tonkin, westwards along the Chinese frontier to a point on theAssam/Tibet frontier to be settled between the Supreme Commander, East Asia,and Commander-in-Chief, India; thence to the coast of Bengal along the westernboundary of a zone in Assam and Eastern Bengal which is to be mutually decided by the Supreme Commander and Commander-in-Chief, India. Thence around the coasts of India and Persia to meridian 60 degrees East.3. Western Boundary.Southward along meridian 60 degrees Eastf to Albatross Island, thenceSouth-Eastward to exclude Rodriguez Islandt. and thence due southward,* Dividing line between Indian theatre and Pacific theatre (J.S.M. 165 4th April, 1942).j- Boundary between India Command and Persia-Iraq Command (Directive to C.-in-C,P.A.I.C., dated the 14th March, 1943).% Transferred to Command of G.O.C.-in-C, East Africa, on the 1st September, 1942(telegram No. C.O.S. (India) 65-9th July, 1942).
ANNEX II.Summary   of   Principal   Administrative   Officers&apos;   Comments   on   theAdministrative Aspects of the Proposed Organisation.The Principal Administrative Officers&apos; views are as follows : (a) The movement and maintenance of forces in South-East Asia depend on many civil as well as military agencies. These are co-ordinated byG.H.Q., India, and by the War Resources Committee of the Viceroy&apos; executive Council.(b) For this reason the Supreme Commander must use G.H.Q., India, as hisadministrative agent for the Army and Air Force.(c) Nevertheless,   the   Supreme   Commander   will   require   a   PrincipalAdministrative Officer with sufficient staff to keep him informed of administrative possibilities, to regulate administrative matters within his command, and to represent his views to G.H.Q., India.(d) To provide a physical link between the Supreme Command headquarters and G.H.Q., this Principal Administrative Officer must have a deputyattached to G.H.Q., India.(e) Demands for equipment and stores for the Army and Air Forces undercommand of the Supreme Commander will as far as possible follow the present channels; but a system requires to be laid down whichwill also cover the needs of the United States and Chinese forces.2. The Principal Administrative Officers conclude that the division of command will entail very thorny administrative problems. They think that these can be solved, given goodwill not only between the two Headquarters, but rightdown the scale.
