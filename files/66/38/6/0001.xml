Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1948.SECRET.W.P. (43) 256.21st June, 1943.WAR CABINET.REBUILDING OF STALINGRAD.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may like to see the annexed copy of a letter which I havereceived from the Soviet Ambassador, together with a copy of my reply.THE heroic stand made by the people of Stalingrad last year in defence oftheir city has made such a great impression on many people in this country thatthey have expressed their desire to show their appreciation in a tangible form ofcontributing towards the restoration of this famous city. Already a considerableamount of money for this purpose has been received at the Embassy from all overthe country, and funds are still being raised and sent in.As the contributions are so numerous I asked the Chairman of theStalingrad Soviet what were the most urgent needs of the city in its recohstruc-tion programme on which this money could be spent in this country. I have now received his reply stating that the following items are the most important, andexpressing the hope that these can be supplied from Great Britain : (1) An automatic telephone exchange with the capacity of 10,000 lines.(2) Five Mobile Power Stations,, of 60 kilowatts each.(3) Plain bare copper conductor, insulated lined cables, and control electricalequipment.(4) Two Hospitals each to accommodate 500 beds.With the money already collected and with the promise given by a numberof bodies and organisations here it is possible immediately to start placing ordersfor these requirements of Stalingrad, but, as you will realise, to do this we need,the necessary permission of the respective British authorities. I have not the slightest doubt that permission will be granted it cannot be otherwise for such agallant city but in order to give proper form to this request I would ask you tobe good, enough to take the necessary steps to obtain what is required. The actualplacing of the orders for all the equipment connected with the above items willbe carried out by the Trade Delegation of the U.S.S.R. in this country.A. E.Foreign Office, 21st June, 1943.M. Maisky to Mr. Eden.My dear Foreign Secretary,25th May, 1943.Yours sincerely,J. MAISKY.12064   [25602]
.-- /&apos;   : . Mr. Eden to M.. Maisky.Mj dear Ambassador, 17th June, 1943.I AM glad to learn that the British public are showing a desire to contributefunds for the rebuilding of Stalingrad. The difficulty lies, however, not so muchin the provision of funds but in the provision of man-power and materials to makethe necessary equipment, and His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that, so long as theindustry of this country is completely harnessed to the production of materialdirectly required for the prosecution of the war, there will be little scope forthe actual placing of orders for the items required for the reconstructionprogramme. As you will appreciate, the manufacture Of many of the itemscovered by the suggested programme could only be&apos;undertaken at the expense of essential war production, and, great though we recognise the needs of Stalingrad,to be, you will certainly agree that war production must come first.The programme mentioned in your letter is a very large one and you will no d,doubt agree that a good deal of exploratory work therefore requires to be done.It would certainly be useful if this preliminary work could be started immediately,and, if you agree, I would suggest that plans should be prepared and specificationsdrawn up so that the actual production can be put in hand as soon as the necessary labour, materials and productive capacity are available. For this purposeMr. Donaldson will be glad to arrange for these matters to be discussed in more detail with the Soviet Trade Delegation.I can give you my assurance that the orders which your Government wishto place in this country will receive a high priority as soon as the need for war materials becomes less pressing.Yours sincerely,ANTHONY EDEN.
