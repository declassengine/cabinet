Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943. ICopy No.WAR CABINET.THE NEED FOR DECISIONS.Memorandum by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Labour and national Service, and the Home Secretary.1. The most urgent need in the immediate post-war period will be to finda home and employment for all those who have served the country. Employersand workers in industry and agriculture will want to know where they stand.Builders of houses, schools and hospitals will be waiting to get to work. All this involves taking definite decisions of policy. But no real progress can be madein shaping Government policy for the post-war period so long as we adhere tothe principle that decisions involving financial commitments cannot be made until our post-war financial position is definitely known. Without a firm decision by the War Cabinet on the subjects which must be dealt with as matters of urgency for the reconstruction period, our plans must remain uncertain andnothing can be brought to the point of legislative enactment.2. It is doubtful whether we shall, when hostilities end, be better placedthan we are now to forecast financial burdens which the Government is capableof assuming. The uncertainties of world trade and military security will inevitably make the financial picture as much a matter of conjecture as it isto-day, but we cannot postpone definite action on internal reconstruction until these have been resolved. We refused to make definite decisions on the beveridge report without having considered other demands. The principle of refusing tomake piecemeal decisions is sound,, but the moral cannot possibly be to make no decisions at all.3. Only one course remains and it is a reasonable one. It is for the Govern-ment to make now the best forecast it can of the financial and economic positionof the country after the war and on that basis to.take a major decision as to the items which it is prepared to carry through into law before the end of the war.We may of course make wrong assumptions but clearly.an assumption that mayturn out faulty is better than none at all. The country will expect us to begin on physical reconstruction immediately hostilities are over, but we shall behopelessly impeded if no decisions have been reached on the use of land, develop-ment rights, compensation, water supply, the financing of the building programme, reorganisation of transport, heat and. power &quot;and the budgetaryimplications of all those and related matters. Some of these other matters likesocial security, education and agriculture, have been before the Cabinet; others are still to come, notably fiscal policies designed to secure full employment, thefuture of industry at home and the export trade and health and colonial policy.4.   Official plans are not enough, nor js the taking of decisions upon them&quot; in principle.&quot;   The subsequent work of preparing legislation takes consider-able time, as the experience of the Beveridge Report is proving, and requires[25635]SECRET.W.P. (43) 255.26th June, 1943.
detailed decisions of policy. Parliamentary time is also needed. We urge,therefore, the taking of early decisions on reconstruction planning intended forwartime legislative implementation where necessary.5. Unless this course is adopted, we are gravely concerned at the situationwhich will arise, particularly if hostilities end suddenly in Europe. It is hard to see how chaos and confusion will be avoided, with all the multifarious problemsof the peace and world re-settlement pressing upon the Government and uponParliament if no firm foundation has been laid for our policy at home. Decisionsthat are taken and laws that are passed in such conditions of extreme pressureare not likely to be well founded, and we think it wrong to allow ourselves or theGovernment which may follow us to be forced into that position. It seems wiser to accept the risks of acting upon our convictions and to bid for the advantages which normally accrue to the man or nation who faces the future with mind madeTipy6n fundamentals.C. R.
