Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 269.(Also W.S. (43) 15.)24iA June, 1943.WAR CABINET.REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE WOMEN&apos;S  SERVICES.ON the 20th January, 1943, the Cabinet decided (W.M. (43) 12th Conclusions)that a Committee should be appointed with Terms of Reference to be settled bythe Deputy Prime Minister, to consider the general question of the future of theWomen&apos;s Services after the war, and in particular the possibility of usingmembers of these services for Reconstruction work in Europe.2. After discussion with the Ministers concerned, the Deputy PrimeMinister settled our Terms of Reference as follows : (a) To consider the future of the three Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services and tomake recommendations.(b) To enquire into the possibilities of utilising for post-war reconstruction in Europe (whether in units or individually) the personnel of those services and women employed whole-time in Civil Defence; and toreport whether any preparatory action to this end is called for.3. The composition of our Committee was settled on the 31st March, 1943,as follows : Mr. Ralph Assheton, Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Chairman).Mrs. M. A. Hamilton, Reconstruction Secretariat (Vice-Chairman).Rear-Admiral H. T. C. Walker, Admiralty.Mr. T. Fry, Admiralty.Major-General D. G. Watson, War Office.Mr. T. J. Cash, War Office.Air Commodore J. W. Cordingley, Air Ministry.Mr. R. C. Richards, Air Ministry.Miss M. Smieton, Ministry of Labour and National Service.Miss J. M. Bowie, Ministry of Home Security.Mr. M. Huxley, Board of Trade, Post-War Commodity and ReliefDepartment.Miss Bowie and Mr. Huxley took part in our discussions on the second butnot on the first part of our Terms of Reference and are only responsible for our recommendations on the second part. The two problems are vj.istinct, and we dealfirst with the more general enquiry into the future of the Women&apos;s Services.I.The Future of the Women&apos;s Services.Evidence.4. Through the Service members of the Committee we obtained the officialviews of the three Service Departments. In addition, we took personal evidence from the Directors of the three Women&apos;s Services. We also saw Miss VioletMarkham, the Chairman of the Committee of enquiry into the amenities and welfare conditions of the Women &apos;s Services, whose report (Cmd. 6384) did muchto create the present interest in the future of these services. &quot;In the following paragraphs we set out the main points which emerged from these enquiries.f255591 -   b
The Service Departments&apos; views.5. Under our terms of reference we were &quot; to consider the future of the threeWomen5s Auxiliary Services.&quot; We have held this to cover not only the post-war period, but the period between the end or partial cessation of hostilities andgeneral demobilisation. We find general agreement that in this earlier phase nopremature disbanding of the Women&apos;s Services ought to be contemplated.Changes will no doubt occur both as regards numbers and organisation,e.g., women will no longer be required on the anti-aircraft defence of GreatBritain, but in general the intention is that the Women&apos;s Services will remainin active employment. In particular, they will take their normal place in anyforces of occupation as soon as conditions permit.6. It is far harder for the Service Departments to forecast their policyafter general demobilisation, when the Services as a whole will have to be reorganised on a peace footing. All three Departments recognise that in any future war similar to the present, the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services will once morehave to be mobilised on a large scale, and neither the Service Departments northe Ministry of Labour wish to contemplate the delays and difficulties experiencedat the start of the present war, which would be bound to recur if, once again,the Women&apos;s Services had to be started from scratch. Plans for the peace-timeorganisation of the Women&apos;s Services must be made with this in mind. But thethree Women&apos;s Services have different functions to fulfil, and the views of thethree Departments as to the organisation required in peace differ accordingly.The W.R.N.S.7. Up to general demobilisation, the W.R.N.S. will still be required.Thereafter the Admiralty are reasonably sure that whatever the size of the Navythere will be no room for any permanent organisation comparable to the existingW.R.N.S. The reasons for this arise from the special circumstances of theNaval Service. The Navy has to maintain a steady flow between the three categories of service (Home Shore, Home Sea, and Foreign Service) which a manhas to undertake, and it is most important to ensure that an individual&apos;s service is fairly divided between the three. A W.R.N.S. organisation of any size would reduce appreciably the number of shore posts available at home, and wouldconflict with this essential feature of the Naval Service. A further reason isthat every Wren so employed would mean one less active service ratingimmediately available for the mobilisation of the Fleet in an emergency.8. On the other hand, the Admiralty, in common with the other service departments, realise that in war the W.R.N.S. may need to be speedilyre-established. Such re-establishment can only take place if there is available a trained reserve, particularly of officers. The Admiralty accordingly plan&apos; themaintenance of a reserve organised to secure such a reserve of trained personnelwithout incurring the loss to the Navy of any large number of posts ashore. Suchan organisation will obviously require some Headquarters&apos; nucleus, but the time is not yet ripe to plan the form which this or the body of the Reserve should take.Something on the lines of the R.N.V.R. may be suitable.The A.T.S.9.   War Office policy after the war will depend upon (i) the budgetary provision and the establishments which are allowed forthe Army in post-war years;(ii) decisions of high policy which have yet to be taken as to future Armyorganization, in particular the continuance of compulsory service inpeace and the existence of the Territorial Army.If army estimates and establishments are stringently reduced, the provisionof an A.T.S., even in the form of a nucleus for further expansion, might haveto be dropped in favour of other services with prior claims.Assuming, however, that financial considerations do not prevent it, the WarOffice favour the maintenance in peace of the framework of Women&apos;s services to provide a basis for future expansion when required.   This would involve (a) a permanent nucleus for administration, training and mobilisation.(b) a reserve either on the lines of the A.T.S. before this war or on those ofthe mens Militia as organised in 1939, though on a voluntary basis..The . choice between the two alternatives will depend on whether theTerritorial Army is reconstituted, or whether compulsory service&apos; for men onMilitia lines is continued after the war.
The W.A.A.F.10. The relation of the W.A.A.F. to the R.A.F. differs in one importantrespect from that of the other Auxiliary Forces to their fighting Services. TheW.A.A.F. serve side by side with the R.A.F. in operational stations, and in orderto ensure that a women&apos;s reserve is admitted to its full share in the work of unitsas a matter of course immediately mobilisation occurs, it is very desirable that a regular women&apos;s service should be maintained in peace time. It is true that inthis war the A.T.S. have also served in operational posts, at anti-aircraft stations,but these duties will disappear in peace, and the War Office are satisfied that theproper organisation for a peace-time service is that set out in the preceding paragraph.Having regard to the functions of .the W.A.A.F., the Air Ministry will wish,assuming that financial and other considerations permit, to maintain a permanent,if small, W.A.A.F. as well as a reserve in peace. If this proved impracticable,they would require, at any rate, a reserve force with the necessary H.Q.organisation so as to ensure an experienced nucleus to train and organise thelarge force to be mobilised in the event of war.The View of the Directors of the Women&apos;s Services.11. Generally speaking, the Directors of the three Women&apos;s Servicesexpressed views in line with the official view of their Departments. The main features in their evidence which call for mention are the following : (a) each Director expressed the personal view that a high proportion of the personnel hoped that the Women&apos;s Services would remain a permanentinstitution and provide them with an opportunity for a permanentcareer.(b) each Director laid special stress on the importance of maintaining their service as a living organisation in peacetime if wartime expansionwas to be achieved in the best conditions. The Director of theW.R.N.S. and the Chief Controller of the A.T.S. recognised that other considerations might rule this out, but they suggested that a permanentservice might be secured without detriment to the peacetime organisa-tion of the armed forces if the Women&apos;s Services undertook certainPay and Record Office work as a permanent commitment, or if theywere given certain positions in Service Establishments which would otherwise be staffed by civilians. The Director of the W.A.A.F.stressed the importance of the permanent existence of her service inorder to maintain the necessary sense of trust amongst the membersof the R.A.F. in the capacity of women to undertake work of a technical nature with .the Air Force. The need to create this trusthad been a hampering feature in the present war at the beginning.She felt it to be of great importance that the peacetime W.A.A.F.should be employed on the full range of duties which would be performed by women in war.(c) The Women&apos;s Services assumed that automatically they would have a partin the forces of occupation, and there would be great disappointmentif this expectation were to be unfulfilled.Miss Markham&apos;s Views.12. Miss Markham in her helpful evidence made it clear at the outset thatthe intention behind the Report of her Committee was to ensure the continued existence of the Women&apos;s Services up to general demobilisation. Sheappreciated that the long-term future of the Women&apos;s Services could only besettled in the future.In the interim period, when forces of occupation would be sent to the liberated countries, Miss Markham urged most strongly that the Women&apos;s Services shouldbe retained. Women wanted to share the men&apos;s work after the Armistice andin particular to accompany the forces of occupation and to play their part inthe liberation of Europe. It was not only a question of what the women deserved,their presence in the forces of occupation would be of benefit to the troops, whowould be less inclined to turn to local populations for feminine companionship.Miss Markham agreed most emphatically that the Women&apos;s Services oughtto accompany the forces of occupation and, as a part of them, share in the relief work incidental to the occupation of liberated or enemy territory.   But. they[25559] b 2
should only operate as part of and under the protection of these forces. She doubted whether, in any case, the personnel of the Women&apos;s Services had the qualifications for independent reconstruction and relief work. She was quite sure that it wouldbe exposing them to unwarrantable risks to let them work outside the protectionof the army.Comments of individual members of the Committee.13. The representatives of the Service Departments maintained the officialviews of their Departments. Other members drew attention to arguments infavour of permanent Women&apos;s Services. There were a number of spheres in theServices for which women have a special aptitude. In addition, it is suggestedthat the presence of Service women in Service Establishments is advantageousfrom the point of view of morale. Finally, there is the consideration thathowever efficient a reserve system, a permanent and living organisation will exercise a continuous educative effect on Service and public opinion and willbetter ensure an adequate supply of trained women to be mobilised for the enlarged Women&apos;s Services which would be needed in time of war.It was also pointed out that the maintenance of standing Women&apos;s services would provide additional opportunities for the employment of women afterthe war.Recommendations. _14. Our recommendations under this part of our terms of reference are set out in paragraph 18 (a) to (/).II.The Possibilities of using for Post-War Reconstruction in Europe, whether inunits or individually, the personnel of the Women&apos;s Services and women employed whole-time in Civil Defence.15.   Our Terms of Reference are &quot; To enquire into the possibilities of using for post-war reconstruction in Europe (whether in Units or individually) the personnel of the Women&apos;auxiliary Services and women employed whole-time in Civil Defence : andto report whether any preparatory action to this end is called for.&quot;. We have recommended, in Part I of our Report that the Women&apos;s services should accompany the Forces of Occupation, once conditions permit. Under thispart of our Terms of Reference we have to consider whether there are any oppor-tunities for members of those services and for women in the Civil Defence services to engage in reconstruction work outside the control of the Occupation Forces.Although it might be considered strictly outside our Terms of Reference, it is so closely linked with them, that we have felt bound, to consider the period whenthe Civil Administration of the liberated territories, including assistance to thelocal population, will be under the control of the Commander-in-Chief. some members of the Women&apos;s Services and of the Civil Defence Services, includingwomen who are nominally part-time workers, may well have qualifications for appointments on- the staff of the Chief Civil Affairs Officer. On theother hand, this staff must be small and the great majority will, no doubt,be men, either specially selected from the Army or specially commissionedcivilians with the required qualifications. Secondly, the question as to whetherand at what stage women can be allowed in an operational area must rest withthe Commander-in-Chief and it is no use training women if they cannot be used.Finally, it is doubtful whether the Women&apos;s Services or the Civil defence services will be able to spare many of their best candidates during this period.16. We now turn to the period envisaged in our Terms of Reference whenmilitary operations are assumed to have moved away from a substantial part of liberated territory and the civil power has resumed administration. Duringthis phase, the United Nations will still have both a moral and a practicalinterest in the sphere of relief. In general, however, it is expected, that the localcivil power will be able to provide for its own administration. The sphere of theproposed United Nations&apos; relief organisation will accordingly be limited andthis country will only be providing a proportion of its staff. The number ofappointments for British candidates is likely to be small and in such circum-
stances there will not be much scope for members of the Women&apos;s Services orfor Civil Defence workers. At the same time, some of the tasks to be performedwill be of a kind for which women have natural aptitude, and have, in the civil defence Services, acquired the necessary experience and training.17.   Our recommendations under this part of our Terms of Reference are setout in paragraph 18 (g) to (i).Recommendations,Part I.18.   We make the following recommendations :  (a) In any future war similar to the present the Women&apos;s Services will again be required on something like their present basis, and we regard it as important that the Service Departments should be able to ensure thatthese Services can be mobilised and built up promptly and efficiently.(b) The Women&apos;s Services will be needed up to general demobilisation, and can play a useful part if they accompany the Forces of Occupationonce conditions warrant their being sent abroad. We recommendthat plans should be made by the Service Departments on this basis.(c) After general demobilisation, the aim should be to maintain Women&apos;services on the following lines, the detailed organisation being, ofcourse, a matter for the respective Departments :  (i) The W.R.N.S. There are practical objections to a permanentservice on an active footing. A Headquarters nucleus shouldbe maintained and a reserve, possibly on R.N.V.R. lines.(ii) The A.T.S.-H would be desirable to maintain a permanent&apos; .        nucleus for administration training and mobilisation with areserve either on the lines of the A.T.S. before the war, or onthe basis of the 1939 Militia (but with voluntary enlistment).(iii) The W.A .A .F. A permanent service on the lines of the existingW.A.A.F. is desirable, though it would no doubt be smaller.(d) Some members of the Committee recommend that the maintenance in being of a small permanent A.T.S. undertaking specific duties (notonly training) would be desirable if funds and establishments permit.(e) We do not feel that detailed plans for the organisation of the Women&apos;services after general demobilisation can be made until the generalplan has been made for the organisation of our armed forces afterthe war and until financial and other conditions are known.(/) Since the future of the Women&apos;s Services must at this stage remain toa large extent undecided, no useful announcement can be made on thelongrterm policy to be adopted. We recommend, however, that an indication of the position up to general demobilisation, with particular reference to the probability of the Women&apos;s Services accompanyingthe forces of Occupation should be given. Assuming that our recom-mendations under (b) are adopted, we suggest for consideration inthe Appendix to this report a form of words in which an announce-ment might be made.Part II.(g) We recommend that members of the Women&apos;s Services and of theCivil Defence Services should be included in the field of volunteersfrom which candidates for appointment under the Chief Civil AffairsOfficer will be selected and that, if appointed, they should take partin the training course which the War Office are preparing. Volunteer -ing must be subject to the requirements of their respective services.(h) We recommend that, if there is any question of sending to Europeorganised units of Civil Defence workers, women should be included among them if and when conditions warrant.(i) We recommend that a full opportunity should be given to the personnel of the Women&apos;s Services and of the Civil Defence Services to volunteer for any jobs which may be open to them, either under theUnited Nations relief organisation or under the voluntary societies.These opportunities to volunteer would be subject to its being possible
for the individuals concerned to be spared from their Service employ-ment. We suggest that the Post-War Commodity and ReliefDepartment of the Board of Trade, which is responsible for plansduring this phase and for the provision of the personnel required should, in consultation with the Service Departments and with theMinistry of Home Security, take the necessary steps to draw attentionto these limited opportunities for volunteering.Signed on behalf of the Committee :RALPH ASSHETON,Chairman.Treasury Chambers,Great George Street, S.W. 1.11th June, 1943.APPENDIX.Suggested Statement to be Made in Parliament.THE future organisation of the Women&apos;s Services after general demobilisa-tion cannot be considered apart from that of the armed forces as a whole, andthe time has not yet come to determine policy on this whole question. TheGovernment can, however, state that for some time after hostilities have ceasedin any area the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services will still be needed. In particular,members of the Auxiliary Services will be needed to accompany the Forces ofOccupation so soon as conditions permit of their being sent overseas.Members of the women&apos;s Auxiliary Services and of the Civil defence services, when and in so far as they can be spared, will be given opportunities to volunteer for . appointments in the administration of liberated territoriesduring the period of military control. In so far as opportunities may arise underthe proposed United Nations&apos; relief organisation, members of these Services, in common with suitable candidates from other sources, will be eligible to volunteerfor appointments provided that they can be spared from their Services. Thenumber of appointments, both during the period of military control and underthe proposed relief organisation, is likely to be very small.
