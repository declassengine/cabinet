Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1943SECRET.W.P. (43) 300.7th July, 1943.WAR CABINET.\ . - . .    :UNITED NATIONS   PLAN FOR ORGANISING PEACE.Memorandum by the -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AS foreshadowed in the last paragraph of my memorandum on thePost-War Settlement (W.P. (43) 292), I circulate to my colleagues herewith a paper which should be considered as replacing the original &apos;&apos; United NationsPlan &quot; contained in W.P. (43) 31 of the 16th January last.&apos; &apos; -; &apos; W^MS/m+m      a. e.Foreign Office, 7th July, 1943.UNITED NATIONS   PLAN FOR ORGANISING PEACE.A.-General Considerations.1. The Atlantic Charter.The principles embodied in the Charter will be the basis of any internationalworld order after the war. But they will need to be applied and interpreted soas to provide definitely both for a world security system and for world economic arrangements.&apos; .     2, Necessity for an International System and International Machinery.(i) It is improbable .that the League of Nations can be revived in its oldform, but it is highly desirable that some international machinery, embodyingmany of the good features of the League, should be established on the conclusionof hostilities.(ii) In any case, every effort should be made to preserve those technical and humanitarian services of the League which have been so conspicuouslysuccessful in the past, and for which there will be scope in the future.(iii) The International Labour Office should- also continue in existence, assuch, its functions being expanded as necessary.(v) But, quite apart from these existing machines, world opinion will undoubtedly demand with increasing insistence that some system should be devised for ensuring political co-operation, the sphere in which the League wasleast successful. The foundations upon which such a system must be bui.lt already exist in the idea of the United Nations.3. Position and Duties of the World Powers.International co-operation between the United Nations will not provide thenecessary cohesion and stability unless the World Powers are prepared to acceptthe responsibilities of leadership within the United Nations. For this purposethese Powers, before the war in Europe comes to an end, should agree between themselves on a common world policy and be prepared, as leaders of the united nations, to take joint action to enforce it. Failing this, we shall be confrontedby the prospect of a world in precarious balance, with the World Powers, each with its circle of client States, facing each other in a rivalry which may mergeimperceptibly into hostility.12095   [25708]        . b217Copy No. 2 8
4. What States should rank as World Potuers.(i) The Four Powers. .The leadership of the United Nations will have in some way to be sharedbetween the British Commonwealth (and more especially the United Kingdom),the United States and the Soviet Union, if only&quot; for the reason that the refusal of any one of these Powers to enter into a world system would render any worldsystem impracticable. In view of her vast area and population and her potentialdevelopment it would be desirable for China, too, to be included in the ranks ofthe World Powers, who between them would thus comprise about two-thirds ofthe population of the globe. We should therefore regard the conception of these four Powers, working within the framework of the United Nations, as the basisof any scheme for world organisation.   ,::(ii) France.The future of Prance is obscure, but it would seem essential that, when she has recovered a measure of her greatness, she should be given the same position asthe Four Powers, if only because without the willing assistance of a rejuvenatedFrance the problem of recreating a sound and free Europe would be much moredifficult.(iii) Germany, Japan and Italy not to be re-admitted as World Powers.It must be assumed that the policy of the United Nations towards the axis power will be to restrict the power for evil of Germany and Japan for as long aperiod as is necessary, and will not be based on the alternative theory that both these Powers should be readmitted in the foreseeable future to internationalsociety on the same footing as the Four (or Five) Powers mentioned above. Italy,on the other hand, has never been a world Power in any real sense, and, in addition,she probably went to war against the real wishes of a considerable proportion ofher population. It is therefore possible to contemplate a non-Fascist Italyadhering to the United Nations after the war (although not in any leadingcapacity) perhaps after some period of probation, and the same applies in varying degrees to the minor Axis allies.5. The World Council.(i) Composition.It follows that there should be a World Council, consisting in the first placeof the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America, Chinaand the United Kingdom, and possibly also of France. To these might be added the representatives of smaller Powers chosen on a regional basis (see para-graph 24), and with certain defined functions (see sub-paragraph (ii) below).Should it prove difficult to obtain the general agreement of the United Nations tothis or any other method of selection, or to these functions, the Four (or Five)Powers should, nevertheless, constitute themselves a Provisional World Counciluntil such time as general agreement can be obtained.(ii) Functions.The functions of any World Council would be two-fold, as follows : (a) Since all the World Powers would always be present, its primary andmost important task would be to smooth out any . frictions existing between them so as to achieve that unity of purpose without which noordered progress will be possible and the peace of the world is boundto be threatened. Where necessary, discussions on these subjects couldbe limited to the World Powers themselves.(&amp;) But, in addition, it would have to take such dispositions for the restraint of aggression and for ensuring the peaceful settlement of disputes asthe needs of a general security system may dictate. It may be hopedthat the other nations (whether numbered during this war among theUnited Nations or among the neutrals) will, as a result of their recent experience, consent to the assumption by the World Powers of leader-ship for that purpose. Naturally the decisions of the World Powerson all such subjects must be unanimous. The smaller Powers should,however^ be given adequate representation on the Council and allowedto influence its decisions. In addition, smaller Powers should always be summoned to sit on the Council when their special interests are under discussion.   If the smaller Powers accept this method there is
no reason why they should not play an important role in. the discus-,sions of the Council. But no opposition on their part should beallowed to prevent the World Powers from taking the necessary action for the restraint of aggression and for ensuring the peaceful settle-ment of disputes. In other words, the final decision on such questions should rest with the World Powers acting unanimously.6. Judicial and Arbitral Machinery.The experience of the League and other bodies has shown the advantage ofestablishing arbitral and fact-finding machines for the settlement of the various kinds of disputes that arise between nations. It will be the duty of the Councilto see that such machinery is used, and it may be hoped that only rarely will theCouncil itself be called upon to make the actual decisions.7. Armaments.An essential part of any future world order will be some agreement betweenthe World Powers as to the forces to be maintained by each of them for internal and external purposes, and also the adoption of some principle regulating the armament of smaller Powers. The armaments which the latter can claim tomaintain will in turn depend on (1) how far the policy and undertakings of theWorld Powers, together with the machinery instituted, guarantee the securityof the smaller Powers, and (2) on how far the latter are themselves prepared toplay their part, whether active or passive, in a general security system.National independence should no longer be considered as a natural right, but asa privilege entailing for the independent State such corresponding obligations and contributions as may be necessary to ensure the maintenance of inter-national well-being, security and peace. If a satisfactory solution of these pointsis achieved, the principle to be adopted might be that the armament of each country should be proportionate to the part it would be called upon to play inthat system. .8. Immediate Post-War Period.(i) For a period after the war, during which they will have a virtualmonopoly of armed strength, the World Powers will, however, have to undertakeby themselves the military responsibility for maintaining order and preventing the building up of aggressive forces in Europe and the Far East. This will entail the maintenance by them of a considerable measure of armaments throughout europe and in Asia; the complete disarmament of the defeated Powers; and theestablishment of a policing system towards the financing of which the defeatedPowers,&apos;relieved of the burden of armaments, should, if practicable, contributeheavily.(ii) For these immediate purposes the most suitable agencies would seemto be some such bodies as United Nations Commissions-which would have thetask, one in Europe, and one in the Far East, of co-ordinating the activities ofthe various Armistice Commissions, and those of other United Nations bodies(see paragraphs 14 and 18). In such Commissions the smaller Allied powers would co-operate.B. Economic and Social Considerations.9. Economic Aspects, of World Order.International friction and aggression frequently have their roots in economicand social disharmonies. Thus, if standards of living are too unequal, stresseswill be created leading to dangerous crises and even to war itself. Consequently,it will be of the highest importance for the United Nations, and in particular forthe World Powers, to concern themselves with world economic and social problems.10. Relief and Reconstruction.It will, for instance, be highly desirable, if not essential, to obtain generalconsent before the end of the war to schemes which will be proof that the combined United Nations can bring and intend to bring early relief to the peoples[25708] &apos; b 2
of disorganised countries. These should include schemes covering monetarycontrol, primary products (especially food-stuffs), &amp;c, so that an &quot;expansionistspiral&quot; of world trade can be initiated. Unless such an expansion of world trade takes place, the economic conditions of many countries may become com-pletely intolerable, and desperate solutions may be urged by desperate people.11. Development of Backward Countries.It will also be necessary to inaugurate steps to smooth out discrepancies in social standards by the encouragement of progressive policies in the less advancedcountries. This will require internationally concerted measures to assist thedevelopment of the more backward countries. It will also be necessary to utilise&apos;the International Labour Office to bring about progressive improvement in labour conditions in the industries of the less advanced countries.12. Role of Smaller States in World Economic Organisations.It is at this point that a reconciliation is possible between the military andpolitical realities underlying the conception of the role of the World Powers as defined above and the economic interest of smaller States. If the World Powersaccept the responsibilities of leadership as the only practicable means of maintain-ing the peace, they should be careful to see that schemes which deal with economicissues, so long as they do not endanger security, are handled by wider assemblies,whether on a world basis or on regional lines. In other words, the constructionof any world authority should be guided by considerations of function.Politically the World Powers, as alone possessing any considerable force, shouldnot hesitate to take the lead. Economically, on the other hand, many Powersother than the World Powers would have much to contribute, and, in so far asthey can contribute, they should have a real voice in the direction of affairs.C.-x\pplication of the plan to europe.13. A ction in regard to Germany.(i) It is likely that any United Nations plan will have to be applied in thefirst instance to Europe. Moreover, the European situation is potentially more dangerous than the Far Eastern as a cause of future wars. The major danger inEurope is the strong central position of Germany, with her large population,natural resources, and highly developed industries, which are the bases of her military power. The maintenance of peace in Europe will consequently dependon the economic as well as the military disarmament of Germany, and on anincrease in the relative economic status and power of Germany&apos;s neighbours.(ii) In order to secure this result, the joint occupation of Germany by thethree major Allies should be accompanied in the early stages by a very close controlover the German economic machine. If this control were successful it would represent an important large-scale experiment in European internationaladministration. h(iii) To prevent the re-emergence of anything like an aggressive German&apos;&apos; Unitary State &apos;&apos; it would probably in addition be desirable &apos;(a) to encourage &quot; particularist &quot; or federal tendencies in any local govern-ments which may set themselves up in Germany when the collapsetakes place, subject always to not allowing such Governments to escape the consequences of the war, and(b) so to organise the occupation of Germany as to foster any particularist,and even eventually separatist tendencies that may reveal themselves.(iv) If these political and economic precautions were taken, and germany was occupied for a considerable number of years, it might not be desirable at once and radically to alter the 1937 (i.e., pre-Anschluss) boundaries of the Reich, withthe exception of the transfer of East Prussia, Danzig, and certain districts of eastern Germany to Poland. If such transfers took place, however, they should in principle be accompanied by transfers of population. Finally, the Kiel Canalshould be internationalized and an international regime applied to the principalGerman waterways. .
521914. The United Nations Commission far Europe.(i) But the best safeguard of all against renewed German attempts to dominate the Continent would lie in the creation of a United Nations commission for Europe (see paragraph 8 (ii)) , consisting of representatives of the UnitedKingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States, with whom a French repre-sentative should, if practicable, be associated on an equal footing. Also associatedwith them, as might be required, would be representatives of the smaller european allies, and also of Canada and South Africa, if these Dominions so desired andwere prepared to make a military contribution to the European policing system.The Commission might be established at some central point in Europe (e.g., Copen-. hagen or Vienna), and would have wide powers. It might well, for instance, inaddition to the functions described in paragraph 8 (ii) above, co-ordinate certain essential services such as transport outside as well as inside the Axis territories.Apart from that it would be the organ for exercising all the powers of the united nations necessary to cope with civil disturbances and any minor hostilitiesthat may flare up after major hostilities have been abandoned.(ii) It is to be hoped that the European neutrals (if any, in fact, remain atthe end of the war) would agree to work in with this Commission. If they did not do so agree, however, the United Nations should not shrink from exercisingpressure on them.(iii) Further, the Allied Forces which would be under the higher control ofthe Commission would, in fact, if not in name, constitute an International PolicePower, which might at a later stage have a more formal international constitution.15. European Confederations.(i) In some cases, particularly in Eastern Europe, we may hope to see the amalgamation of the smaller Powers into Confederations. The base for two suchConfederations already exist and others might be formed elsewhere. But it is evident that any durable grouping in Eastern Europe can only come about as aresult of complete co-operation between the Soviet Government and other leading members of the United Nations.(ii) It is also assumed that it will not be the intention of the World Powersto attempt to force European nations into unions against their will. Subject tothis, it might be possible for the United Nations Commission for Europe, forinstance, to encourage &quot; regional &quot; tendencies by centralizing certain services incertain specified areas.16. The Future of Europe.The measures taken by the United Nations to pacify the peoples of europe and to restore their means of livelihood and of production will, if they are wellconceived and executed, go far towards creating the conditions under whichEuropean co-operation may eventually become a reality. To provide a politicalframework for the various military and economic measures contemplated, it isto be hoped that the United Nations Commission for Europe (see paragraph 14)may at some stage become a &quot; Council of Europe,&quot; on which all European states should be represented, including the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, withthe addition, it is to be hoped, of the United States. Neutrals (and Austria)should be admitted to the Council as soon as practicable, and at a fairly early stage Italy and the lesser enemy States; but the admission of Germany must be(delayed until at any rate after the occupation has ended and could only then take place as a result of some unanimous decision of the World Council. a council of Europe in which the United Kingdom, the United States of America,and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics did not play an active part might become, in course of time, an instrument through which Germany could recoverpeacefully that hegemony over Europe which she has momentarily establishedby force of arms during the present war.D. Application to the Far East.17. Security Measures in respect of Japan.(1) Disarmament.The Far Eastern situation will differ from the European in several important respects. It will be necessary to disarm Japan and for that purpose an armistice commission on the lines of that proposed for Germany should be set up.   In
order to achieve its purpose it must insist on the abolition of fortified zones in japan and other internal arrangements designed to preserve secrecy as to herintentions. But once these measures have been carried out a prolonged military occupation of Japan may be neither necessary nor desirable, for, in contra-distinction to Germany, it should be possible to control Japan&apos;s armaments by economic means provided adequate naval and air forces are available in the background.(ii) Control of Japan&apos;s armaments by indirect means.It is assumed that Japan will be deprived of her Empire; including korea and Formosa. This would mean in effect the confinement of the Japanese people to the islands of Japan proper. In such circumstances they will scarcely be ableto feed themselves, let alone carry on their industries, without a considerable: international trade. Moreover, Japan has only one primary product with an export surplus, silk, and after the war this will lose much of its economic importance owing to the development of Nylon. Unless, therefore, it is proposedto allow a large number of Japanese to starve, it will be necessary to permit theJapanese to develop their imports and exports. But this can be done in sucha manner as to allow them to exist but at the same time prevent them from becoming a danger to other countries. The Japanese, it is true,, are a unitedand highly disciplined people who are likely to seek to evade the controls imposed on them. But in order to build up aggressive armaments Japan would have to import the necessary raw materials. If these materials are rationed by aninternational authority commanding wide control she will be helpless. such machinery must, therefore, be set up in the first place under the armistice commission, but perhaps later developing into a more permanent economic body.(iii) Permanent Defence System for the Far East.It will also be necessary to construct a permanent defence system, as a furtherprecaution against Japanese aggression and to make possible the economic controlof Japan suggested in sub-paragraph (ii) above. For this purpose all suitablebases in the Western Pacific and in Eastern Asia might be put at the disposalof a United Nations Pacific Council of Defence, composed of the United States ofAmerica, United Kingdom, Union of Soviet Socialist republics, China,Canada, (possibly France), Australia, New Zealand, (possibly Portugal) and theNetherlands, which would command the necessary air and naval forces.18. Economic and Political Measures.There will have to be a Relief and Rehabilitation Commission to assist Chinaand other countries, including Japan. Both this body and the armistice commission might be co-ordinated by a United Nations Far Eastern Commission,and this might some day develop into a &quot; Council of the Far East,&quot; which coulddeal in the first instance with the economic and political problems of that area.Representation of the smaller Far Eastern countries on the World Council (Chinabeing in any case a member ex officio) might also be arranged by means of&apos;this body.19. India.The immediate future of India is too uncertain for her place in the worldsystem to be very exactly defined. It is to be hoped that she will find it as a dominion. She might immediately be associated in some wa,y with the PermanentDefence System of the Far East (see paragraph 17 (iii)) and/or the South-EasternAsiatic regional system (see paragraph 24). Communal difficulties might possibly stand, in the way of her association with the Middle East regional system(paragraph 22) in spite of her interest in the defence of that area.E.-Eventual World Organisation.20. Principles governing &quot;Regionalism.&quot;Generally speaking, tendencies towards regional groupings should be encouraged, subject always to the principle that no one World Power by itself should be given the task of maintaining order in any particular region. For thecontrary principle, if admitted, would give rise to rivalries as between one group and another and hence sow the seeds of future war.  In discussing &quot; regionalism,&quot;
therefore, we must assume that all the World Powers are in principle equallyinterested in maintaining the peace, and that they will speak with one voice and act together whenever and wherever it may be threatened.&apos; 21. Regional Institutions.To enable the Great Powers to exercise effective control - and to associate thesmaller Powers to the greatest possible extent in a world system it may be foundconvenient to set up regional institutions. Such institutions would have severaldifferent objects. They might be used for security, for political and economiccollaboration, or for the development and control of dependencies. It has alreadybeen mentioned (paragraphs 16 and 18) that a &quot;Council of Europe&quot; and a&quot;Council of the Far East &quot; may eventually result from the immediate measureswhich must be taken in these two areas. But such developments will take time,and meanwhile regions of smaller extent may be used to obtain the objectsmentioned above.22. Regional Defence Systems (Atlantic and Pacific).Thus there might come into existence two regional systems whose main object was to maintain security against Germany and Japan, (i) There might be an atlantic System which associated the United Kingdom, the Union of soviet socialist Republics and the United States with the countries of the Westernsea-board of Europe (including Denmark) and Canada for purposes of common defence, including the provision of air and sea bases in, e.g., Bergen or the atlantic Islands. It might well be necessary to sub-divide this system into aNorthern and Southern Atlantic system. The latter, if formed, would of courseinclude certain South American States, and notably Brazil and the Argentine,(ii) A similar system could, as contemplated in paragraph 17 (iii), be set up inthe Pacific. Here again it might be found desirable to associate with this systemsome South American State with a Pacific sea-board, such as Mexico, Chile, orPeru.23. Miaied System (Eastern Europe and Middle East).A Confederation or Confederations in Eastern Europe might form the nucleus, with the assistance of the World Powers (other than China) of a regionalsystem not only for military, but also for political and economic defence againstGermany. The Middle East is in a special position, since it contains neither enemy states nor (except to a very limited extent) colonial areas; but here also there might be a system which should enable the World Powers concerned to some extentto share the responsibility for its defence and provide the leadership necessaryto overcome obstacles in the way of political and economic collaboration. such arrangements, however, should not conflict with the treaty position of GreatBritain,, under which the independent sovereignty of many of the nationscomprised in the area at present rests.24. Colonial Systems.Three regional systems might be set up for colonial dependencies consistingin the first instance of the &quot; Parent States &quot; concerned, together with other Stateshaving a major economic or strategic interest in the area. Thus, dependenciesin SouthJEasjtarn, Asia might be associated together not only for economic collabor-ation but also in order to establish the responsibility of the Powers administeringthem and to encourage the gradual development of self-government. The Tropicaldependencies in, Africa might also be combined in one or more regional groupsfor similar purposes, while the Caribbean^CpJbnies (and the Guineas) might fall into another group.. 25. Regional Representation in the World Council.In addition to the functions mentioned above, regions might be used asthe means of selecting representatives to sit on the World Council with those ofthe World Powers. The Pa,n-American System would naturally be one region and might elect two representatives. Europe might also choose two representa-tives, possibly one from Western and. one from Eastern Europe if the systemssuggested in paras. 22 and 23 came into existence. The Far Eastern region, theMiddle East and the British Commonwealth of Nations (other than the UnitedKingdom) might each select one representative.
26. Functions of the Council and Assembly.Such a Council of 11 or 12 members, meeting at regular intervals, would notbe too large for effective business under the leadership of the World Powers,while it would link all parts of the world together and serve as a final Courtof Appeal for all political or economic issues capable of threatening the peace.But an Assembly of all the United Nations might in addition be summonedat fairly long intervals (say every two years) to receive and discuss reports fromthe Council and the economic bodies described in para. 10.27. Alternative Methods of Representation.On the other hand (as already stated in para. 5 (i)), it must be recognised thatit may be difficult or impossible to establish such a system of regional repre-sentation. If this should prove to be the case it might be possible to fall back onelection of seven representatives by an annual Assembly. Failing this, the only alternative would be the Four (Five)-Power Council referred to in para. 5 (i).28. Where should all this International Machinery betHow far the Council (and consequently the Assembly) should have a regularmeeting place is primarily a matter for consideration by the World Powers.But the Council, like the League Council in its earlier stages, could, if desired,meet at different places according to convenience. The international economicand social bodies would., however, certainly need a permanent centre, which it issuggested might be in the Western Hemisphere, as well as a permanent secretariatin which the existing staffs of the League and the I.L.O. should be incorporated.It might well be that the Council would often in practice find it convenient tomeet at that centre.&quot; 29. Secretariat.It might be better not to form any elaborate international political secretariatuntil it is seen how the Council and Assembly are going to work and where the headquarters of the new organisation is likely to be. But it would obviously be necessary to have some &quot; Secretary-General :&apos; or &quot; Moderator &quot; with a smallstaff to produce the agenda, conduct correspondence with the economic and regional organisations and generally make arrangements for the meetings of the Counciland Assembly.
