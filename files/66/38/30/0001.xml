The following Motion on Post-War Agricultural Policy has been placed upon the Order Paper : &quot; Mr. Tree,- Mr. Quibell- Mr. Wilfrid Roberts,- Mr. Butcher-Major York,- Mr. Price,- Colonel Sir George Courthope, Viscount Hinchinbrooke- Mrs. Tate,  Mr. Lambert, Mr. Turton,  Mr. Spearman,- Captain Thorneycroft, Major Sir Derrick Gunston,- Mr. Story,- Mr. Linstead, Lieutenant-Colonel Lancaster,  Captain Gammans,  Mr. Emmott, Earl Winterton,- &apos; Sir Joseph Lamb,  Mr. Bower, Mr. Wedderburn,  Lieutenant-Colonel Marlow,  Sir Alfred Beit, Mr. Wootton Davies- Sir Cyril Entwistle,  Mr. Lipson, -Major Gates,  Mrs. Cazalet Keir,- Sir Ralph Glyn,  Mr. Hogg, Mr. Molsom,  Mr. Hamilton Kerr,  Major Sir Jocelyn Lucas,- Mr. Colegate,  Commander King-Hall,  Mr. Driberg, Lady Apsley, &apos;    Mr. De La Bere,     Mr. Snadden, -Agricultural Policy, That in the opinion of the House a vigorous and efficient home agriculture, allied to constructive planning for international control of the marketing and distribution of the world&apos;s primary products isessential to the well-being of the nation; and that to this end the government policy should, be directed to maintaining the fertility of the soil,- the satis-fying of the needs of nutrition, guaranteeing fair prices and a stable market to the producers and securing conditions for rural workers not less favourable than those enjoyed by town dwellers.&quot;No date has yet been fixed for this Motion but it is understood that it islikely.to be taken about the middle of July.2. We wish to seek the guidance of the War Cabinet on the line whichshould be taken in the Debate on this Motion. We suggest that the Governmentshould, accept the Motion. Indeed, in our view, it would be extremely difficult for the Government to reject it or seek to move any amendment without givingthe appearance of departing from the previous statements made by the Goyern-ment on post-war agricultural policy.*3. If it is decided to accept the Motion it would then be possible to avoid the necessity of the Government Spokesman explaining again the reasons why we have not yet entered upon the promised discussions with the industry. in accepting the-Motion the Minister of Agriculture would propose to confine his speech to general observations and also to refer to the agricultural aspects of theFood Conference recently held at Hot Springs.\        4.   We ask for the authority of the War Cabinet to proceed along these lines.R. S. H.T.
