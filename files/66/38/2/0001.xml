Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 252.ISth June, 1943. \\TO BE KEPT UNDER  LOCK ANli KEY, It is requested that special care may beNtaken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.MORALE AND THE WAR AGAINST JAPAN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.THE Secretary of State for India, in his Paper W.P. (43) 232, has drawn attention to the tendency among the British troops in India to assume that when germany and Italy have been beaten the war will virtually be over and they willbe able to return home. Similar views may be prevalent among members of theForces elsewhere as well as among civilians.Propaganda.2. Although, as the Minister of Information points out (W.P. (43) 238),the Prime Minister has made it clear that it will be a public duty to tackleJapan when the time comes, there will be a clear need, when Germany has been defeated, for a vigorous propaganda campaign explaining the reasons for thecontinued prosecution of the war. Meanwhile, there should be some preparationof the ground.3. The lines of the propaganda might well follow those suggested inparagraphs 3 and 4 of W.P. (43) 232. The points which it would be desirable to stress are : (a) The Dominions helped us in our hour of need; so we must &quot;help themin theirs.(b) The Japanese attacked us when we were weak and inflicted on us ahumiliating defeat; so we must wipe off the score.Practical Measures for sustaining Morale of Troops.4. Between the cessation of hostilities in Europe and the defeat of Japan,the R.A.F. like the other two Services -will have to face difficult problems fromthe standpoint of morale: The size of the Force needed both for waging war on japan and supporting * the occupying forces of Europe will be incomparablygreater than the pre-war air force. Many eyes will be turned to the morecomfortable conditions of civil life. There must not only be an understanding and acceptance of the need to go on with the war, but the men will need to be assured that the Government are taking practical steps to safeguard their interests while on extended active service.Demobilisation.5. It is suggested that, so far as practicable, the Minister of Labour should endeavour to ensure that a due proportion of the good jobs are kept availablefor those who are retained for service against Japan; and that the Governmentshould announce that this is their policy.Relief for Personnel serving Overseas.6. It is further suggested that arrangements should be made, so far as shipping facilities allow, for an exchange of personnel serving overseas and at[25594]
home; otherwise, the home-service men might seem to be getting the best of bothworlds, having served during the war with Germany near their own homes andreaped the additional advantage of being demobilised first. The three Servicesand the Ministry of War Transport will have to consult together on this problem.Conscription.7. A major question which arises is whether or not the.National service acts should continue to be applied to the younger age groups after Germany is out of the war. The continuance of conscription would reassure those retained in the Services that measures were being taken for their gradual replacement,and would make them feel that the burden was being more evenly shared. Thisis, however, a controversial issue, and there is something to be said for manningthe Services during the Japanese war on a volunteer basis if the man-power position allows. The problem should be explored now and an announcement madeat an opportune moment.Pay and Allowances.8. Finally, the nation will be under a special obligation to those men who,while others are returning to civil life, will have to continue in the Services andendure the dangers and hardships of the war in the East. Accordingly, I suggestthat the rates of pay and conditions of service should again be reviewed to ensurethat, so far as our resources permit, they compare not unfavourably with thoseobtaining in civil life. Improvements held to be justifiable on these groundswould be brought into effect immediately the European war comes to an end.Inter-Departmental Committee.9. The points in paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 above will require further exploration by the three Service Departments in consultation with the otherDepartments concerned. I therefore support the proposal in the India OfficePaper (WP. (43) 232) that the War Cabinet should set up an Inter-DepartmentalCommittee&apos;to thrash out the problems and make recommendations. I do not feel strongly on the point whether the Committee should have a Ministerial Chairman,as suggested in W.P. (43) 232, or should be entirely composed of officials as suggested in W.P. (43) 239. As the chief function of the Committee will be to formulate proposals, I am inclined to favour the latter alternative.Air Ministry, 18th June, 1943.A. H. M. S.
