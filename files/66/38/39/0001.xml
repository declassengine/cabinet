Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.SECEET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 289.2nd July. 1943.WAR CABINET.POLITICAL AFFAIRS IN THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a despatch of the 4th June,1943^ from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in the Union of SouthAfrica.C. R. A,Dominions Office, 2nd July, 1943.Office of the High Commissionerfor the United Kingdom,Sir, Pretoria, Ath June, 1943.I have the honour to report that the final session of the eighth Parliament ofthe Union ended on the 27th April, and that preparations are now well advancedfor the general election which is to take place on the 7th July. The Governor-General&apos;s proclamation dissolving Parliament will have been issued by the endof May or early in June and. official nominations will be made on the 14th June.In telegrams sent at frequent intervals during the session I reported the maindevelopments of. interest to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.In this despatch it is my aim to present a rather more coherent picture of politicalevents and tendencies than is possible in a series of telegrams. :,2. The session opened on the 16th January in the atmosphere of mistrustand irritation which commonly surrounds a dying Parliament. The victory atEl Alamein and the Allied landing in North Africa had marked a turning pointin the war, and the inauguration of the Allied offensive on land. government supporters for two and a half years had been on the defensive against the gibesand sometimes pro-German tendencies of the Opposition groups. In that long period a series of setbacks to the Allied cause had imposed well-understoodrestraints on pro-war critics of the Government. More recently, however, whilethe Opposition was rent by ideological confusion and the ambitions of rivalleaders, the Allies had set their feet on the long road to victory; and government supporters, released at last from the inhibitions imposed by adversity, couldsavour the satisfaction of indulging their own grievances against the executive,and even their private feuds within the Government coalition.3. The opening of Parliament was the signal for a remarkably outspokendiscussion in the Pro-Government press of the place which Parliament now- occupies in the national life, of the deficiencies of members and the faults of thepresent Government. The Natal Mercury, for example, expressed the hope that members &apos;&apos; would not forget that they are not elected and paid  700 a year merely for the purpose of dutifully voting as the Party whips direct.&quot; There was atime, not so long ago, it continued, &quot; when the majority commanded by general smuts was so delicately poised that normal criticism by his supporters had neces-sarily to be dropped. Those days are past. General Smuts&apos;s Government is nowfirmly established, and the Opposition is at such sixes and sevens, that constructivecriticism of certain aspects of the Government^ activities can do nothing butgood. Tame acquiescence in the view of some members of the Cabinet that Govern-ment Departments can do no wrong is&apos; thoroughly unhealthy and reducesParliament to a state which does much to justify the cry that it is nothing but anuisance and a waste of time.&quot; The same paper a few days later accused theGovernment of being &quot; an inveterate breeder of bureaucratic bodies,&quot; which were doing much to undermine the authority of Parliament.   The East London[25674] b
Despatch declared that &quot; there is much criticism of the Government m thecountry, even among General Smuts&apos;s most loyal supporters, but when con-stituents pass on their grievances to their members of Parliament the latter find it impossible to pass them on to the Government.&quot;4. The Natal Witness complained of the &quot; benevolent dictatorial attitude ofthe present Ministerial executive &apos;&apos; and suggested that the Prime Minister &apos;&apos; hadusurped powers far beyond the limits needful for the efficient running of the warmachine. In other words,&quot; it said, &apos;&apos; he has far outstripped Mr. Churchill, who hasalways insisted that he is a servant of Parliament, in gathering the reins of powerinto his hands.&quot; The weekly Forum which, oddly enough, is closely connectedwith Mr. Hofmeyr, the most bureaucratic of Ministers, declared that &apos;&apos; Parliamentprovides the Government but cannot be said to exert very much influence either in the direction of inspiring State policy or as a check on Government action.&quot;In the early weeks of the session Mr. Burnside of the Labour Party, one of theablest and most independent of the younger members, expressed the general sense of frustration among Government supporters in the House of Assembly when hecomplained that the Government, in its appointment of boards and committees to deal with problems of reconstruction, consistently ignored the claims ofMembers of Parliament. Parliament, he said, was fast developing into thestatus of a rubber stamp. &quot; We are being consistently lowered in our status andbecoming more and more nonentities. Apart from venturing now and againinto a debate we have no real say in the Government of the country.&quot;5. These are significant complaints and. not to be dismissed as merely thereflection of trends inherent in the wartime growth of executive power. Govern-ment back-benchers in recent sessions have, it is true, been deprived of theirfair share of time in debate by the determination of the Government to keepthe sessions short; but complaints go deeper, than that. In South Africa, as inso many other countries governed by Parlamentary constitutions, the emergence of great national leaders has tended to shift the balance of forces in the State.Even before the war the prestige and authority of Parliaments and of congress were declining in the face of the growing power of Prime Ministers andPresidents. This process has inevitably been stimulated by the necessities of war.To-day in the Union the figure of the Prime Minister dominates the wholepolitical scene to the exclusion of any rival. On the Government side his authority is unchallenged and unchallengeable. In his shade other trees appear stuntedand puny growths. Members of the Cabinet seem to have no. independentexistence; it is from him that they derive their authority and it is in his will thattheir actions find support. General Smuts as Prime Minister is not merely thefirst among equals. With the great increase in his personal authority and powerthere has ensued a corresponding decline in the doctrine of collective responsi-bility : when Mr. Hofmeyr actively opposed the Government measure to control the penetration of Indians into European areas in Durban he made only a formalgesture of resignation. It was clear that the opposition of even a leading memberof the administration to a Government measure was of such minor significancethat he was permitted to remain in the Cabinet despite his disagreement withits considered policy. *6. Individual members of the Cabinet have declined in power vis-a-vis the Prime Minister, but the Cabinet as a whole has increased its authority and functions as against the general body of Parliament. It is the realisation of this tendency that provoked such a sense of frustration among many pro-government supporters in the House of Assembly during the recent session that at one stagemore than a handful of the abler back-benchers on the Government side were&apos;openly declaring their intention not to stand for Parliament in the comingelections. The remark quoted above from Mr. Burnside&apos;s speech found an echoin many corners of the House. There is a general feeling that the. private memberhas a negligible share in the formulation of policy. His interventions in debateare frowned upon as holding up the rapid progress of the business of the house and severely discouraged by the Whips; even in the United Party caucusdiscussions were perfunctory and unreal, and attempts to deal with broad mattersof future policy were received with some impatience by General Smuts. Outsidethe House, and remote from its control, the ordinary member watched themultiplication of commissions and controllers, all thriving under the aegis of executive power. A vast structure of bureaucratic control had spread itself overalmost every area of the national life. Much of its activities had given rise towidespread criticism. Members of Parliament, bombarded with complaints byconstituents,  found themselves powerless to intervene; yet inevitably they
attracted to themselves a share of the unpopularity for policies which they were unable to influence and over which they&apos; had no control.7. On the Opposition side this feeling of frustration was not so widespread.Here, Members could not be blamed for unpopular policies or the faults ofadministration; they were not subject to the same restrictions on speech as their colleagues of the Government side, and they could enjoy the excitements ofirresponsible opposition. Moreover, it was part of the Nationalist Party&apos;s policy to exalt the functions of Parliament and to stress its own importance as thepolitical front of Afrikanerdom, as against its rivals of the Ossewa Brandwagand the New Order who were busy decrying the value of Parliamentaryinstitutions : much had happened since the uncertain days of two years beforewhen the Nationalist Party appeared to be forsaking the paths of Parliamentarydemocracy in deference to an apparently triumphant totalitarian Germany.8. Although the Prime Minister waited until the middle of the sessionbefore confirming the general expectation that a general election would take placethis year as prescribed by the Constitution, the thoughts of all parties were clearlydominated throughout by the coming ordeal by ballot. Thus, on the Governmentside there were strains in the coalition as the two minor partners, the Labourand the Dominion Parties, entered into a bitter rivalry between themselves andsought to strengthen their bargaining position as against the United Party. TheLabour Party&apos;s confidence that it would be able to administer the final blow tothe declining fortunes of Colonel Stailard&apos;s followers and its determination to invade the Dominion Party&apos;s constituencies in Natal had from the outsetremoved any probability of an election arrangement between these junior partners in the Government coalition. It wTas this conflict that introduced politicalcomplications into the problem caused by the accelerated purchase of Europeanproperties in Durban by Indian investors. Had the elections still been a distantprospect the problem might well have yielded to compromise and administrative action; as it was, the Dominion Party recklessly exploited the European agitation in Durban for drastic remedies as a means of bolstering up its declining politicalfortunes. In the process it imported a new bitterness into the dispute and sought to-blackmail the Government into legislative discrimination against the Indianpopulation. It was clear that with the Dominion Party, despite all its pastdemonstrations of loyalty to the British Commonwealth, considerations ofImperial unity counted as nothing against the temptation of opportunistelectioneering in Natal. An incisive speech by Mr. Burnside effectively exposedthis contrast between profession and practice in the present policy ofColonel Stallard and his friends. The House of Assembly witnessed thesignificant spectacle of the Dominion Party and the Nationalists in cordialco-operation trying by amendments to extend the restrictive provisions of the Bill:the circle was complete and the two extremes could meet on the common ground of racial prejudice.9. The Labour group, for its part, made a demonstration of its Socialistprinciples in a debate which was specially introduced for this purpose; but mr. Madeley, acutely conscious as he was of the advantage which the Labour party would gain from entering the elections with the support of General Smuts&apos;s greatprestige, succeeded in defeating the pressure of the left-wing section of his partyfor withdrawal from the coalition. General Smuts has since arranged an electoralagreement with the Labour Party on the basis of granting to it the united party&apos;s support in five constituencies additional to the four already held by labour; and he has maintained the alliance with the Dominion Party by a&quot; standstill &quot;agreement as far as the United Party are concerned.10. The Governments principal concession to election necessities, apartfrom the introduction and translation into law of the Bill dealing with Indianpenetration, was the decision to remove the principal source of soldiers&apos; discontentby raising the pay and allowances of the lower ranks at a total additional costof  5-1 millions a year. Some indication of the effect of the improvement inscales is to be gained from the fact that a married private soldier with two children will now receive  27 a month as against  18 5s. under the old scales.This is a considerable increase, and it is significant that since it was announced the soldiers&apos; grievances, which attracted so much attention on the return of theFirst Division to the Union some months ago, appear to have largely evaporated.These increases were generally welcomed, even by the Nationalist Party, whichis eager to conciliate the soldiers&apos; vote. But among the more far-sighted membersof the United Party there was some criticism of the Governments failure to[25674] b 2
mitigate the inflationary effects of the new scales by &quot; freezing &quot; some part atleast of the increases in the form of compulsory savings. Mrs. Ballinger and theother natives&apos; representatives, for their part, bitterly complained about theGovernment&apos;s decision to raise the pay of the Native Military Corps by no morethan threepence a day. They drew an uncomfortable contrast between the  2 15s.a month which is now paid to the dependants of native soldiers and the  7 10s.which the Smit Committee have declared to be the minimum income necessaryfor a native family in the towns. The Prime Minister, replying to a vigorousspeech by Mrs. Ballinger on this subject, justified the failure to make a larger increase in the case of the Native Military Corps by emphasising that the originalpay had been based on the wages paid by the gold mines and that, in any case,80 per cent, of the men in this branch of the army came from the rural areas,where the allowance was alleged to be adequate.11. In the first weeks of the session the Prime Minister piloted through bothHouses his resolution removing the restriction on the employment of South african troops beyond the shores of the African continent. This restriction was part ofthe resolution accepted by Parliament at the instance of General Smuts at theoutbreak of war. The Opposition took the line that the undertaking in that resolution not to send South African forces &quot; overseas, as in the last war,&quot; was,in effect, the basis of a contract which the Prime Minister had made withParliament, and that it had been instrumental in winning the support of many members who otherwise would have voted against South Africa&apos;s&quot;entry into war.They complained that, in the case of the Madagascar expedition at least, thePrime Minister had acted in violation of this undertaking. The Prime Minister,in reply, argued that this resolution was the responsibility of Parliament, andthat, although it had been accepted on his initiative, it did not tie him personallyand irrevocably to the policy of &quot;limited belligerency.&quot; General Smuts wouldhave been more effective in his defence had he relied frankly on the indisputablecontention that circumstances had changed in the intervening period in a way which &quot;none could have foreseen; and that the policy which he now askedParliament to accept was merely the logical continuation of a policy which had developed to meet new needs as they had appeared during the past three years..12. An important feature of the session was the continued, and indeedaccelerated, decline in the political fortunes and Parliamentary reputation ofMr. Hofmeyr. He had produced a Budget which maintained the Union&apos;financial sacrifices for the war at a level much lower than those of any of theother active&apos;participants; but by the complexity of his taxation measures andhis unwillingness to remove their numerous well-known anomalies he had arousedthe outspoken antagonism of large sections of commerce and industry. His replyto the Budget debate was merely a display of academic virtuosity; its verybrilliance and self-complacency provoked the resentment of a House of assembly which objected to being lectured like the dunces of the Lower Fifth. Mr. Hofmeyrcontinues a lonely and unsympathetic figure, contemptuous of the amenities of friendly intercourse and altogether lacking a personal following. Outside theHouse, he was conscious of mounting unpopularity in the country and the press.In the depths of the platteland he was still known as a &quot; kafferboetie &apos;&apos; (theepithet applied to anyone of even the most mildly liberal attitude towards the natives), but in university and other circles, where he had first gained support as the advocate of a more enlightened policy, it was generally admitted that hehad in fact abdicated the leadership of liberal opinion. Certainly in his Budgethe had shown little appreciation of the function which taxation is made to perform in advanced States of mitigating the extremes of poverty and of wealth;still less had he made any adequate financial contribution to the war effort ofthe United Nations. In his provision for social welfare and for specifically nativeservices he had made, in more than three years at the Treasury (admittedly yearsof war), only a negligible advance. Only in the Capitalist ranks of the miningcircles of the Witwatersrand did he still preserve some remnants of popularity :the leaders of the mining industry were grateful for his action at the outbreakof war in substituting the &quot;Special Contribution&quot; (which everyone connectedwith the gold-mining industry ostentatiously assumes is limited to the war period)for the more dangerous tax of Mr. Havenga (which appropriated all the incre-ment in the gold price beyond the fixed margin). But even they had not altogetherlost their long-standing liking for Mr. Havenga, who might, they considered; stillbe able to bring a useful body-of Afrikaner, support into a reconstructed united party after the war.
*13. The &quot; Laingsburg incident&quot; half-way through the session proved a disastrous test of Mr. Hofmeyr&apos;s capacity for leadership in a moment ofParliamentary crisis. A body of Cape Coloured soldiers returning to Pretoriafrom leave in Cape Town had got out of control and done damage at stationsthrough which they passed by train. At the small Karroo town of Laingsburgtheir wild career was finally checked by a group of local military volunteers, whoafter some confusion fired on them, killing three. These events were given greatprominence in the Cape Town Nationalist newspaper, Die Btorger, and it was clear that the authorities had been negligent in not providing any adequate escortfor the train or in taking effective steps to prevent drunkenness and unseemlybehaviour. When the House of Assembly met the following morning, Dr. Malanmoved the adjournment on a matter of urgent public importance and proceeded to lay the blame at the Governments door for its policy of arming non-europeans and of generally failing to keep non-Europeans &quot; in their place.&quot; He alsodropped some dark hints about the activity of &quot; Communist agitators.&quot; It was unfortunate that the Prime Minister was not present; at that moment he wasreturning by air from Pretoria. Mr. Hofmeyr, as leader of the House, had to reply for the Government. He had been fully supplied with particulars of the disturbances before the House met; but in reply to Dr. Malan he chose to make.a petulant debating speech denying the accuracy of the account in Die Burger(although that now appears to have been substantially correct) and tactlesslysuggesting that the Nationalists were merely out to turn the incident to politicaluse. General Smuts, when he arrived in Cape Town later in the morning, was told of the lamentable tenor of the debate in Parliament and is reported to haveexpressed some irritation at Mr. Hofmeyr&apos;s handling of the issue. In the House,after the luncheon adjournment, he made a statement which was a clearrepudiation of Mr. Hofmeyr&apos;s defence. He frankly admitted the main facts ofthe occurrence and said that he had been &apos;&apos; badly let down &apos;&apos; by his troops. he intended to institute a most rigorous public enquiry and to punish those who were held responsible. This effectively took the wind out of the Opposition^ sails; butthe Malanites exploited the opportunity of pointing out the contrast between mr. Hofmeyr&apos;s and General Smuts&apos;s handling of the House to the detriment of the former. In this their feelings were shared by the back benchers on theGovernment side.14. . I have fully reported to you as it developed the situation in regard tothe Indian &quot; penetration &quot; Act. Here it is enough to say that, in the view, ofmany competent observers, the manner in which Mr. Hofmeyr conducted hisopposition to the Bill has finally dissipated what probabilities there might havebeen of his ultimate succession to General Smuts in the leadership of the united party. For a week after his offer of resignation in the first Cabinet meeting held to discuss the Bill he made no attempt to check the inflated rumours about aCabinet &quot; crisis,&quot; which were seized upon with avidity by the Opposition press and found support even in the pro-Government papers.. When in the end he made his statement in the House, it was clear that he was taking his stand ona matter of merely technical significance while giving away the whole principleof legislative discrimination against Indians in Natal. He gave general offenceby the high moral tone in which he expressed the minutiae of his disagreement with the Government; and it was significant that the Prime Minister, speakingin the debate, made only a passing reference to the &apos;&apos; sincerity&apos;&apos; ofMr. Hofmeyr&apos;s speech and did not attempt to traverse his ingenious argument.15. The difficulty over the Indian penetration Bill demonstrated thatMr, Hofmeyr was without any personal support either in the United Party caucusor in the Cabinet. Dr. Steyn was careful not to intervene in the controversy; but no one was in doubt about its effect on the rivalry between the two ministers for the ultimate succession to General Smuts. In the wrestling match which had long been the subject of lively cartoons in the Nationalist press Dr. Steyn was nowalways depicted on,top; their contest became the subject of open jibes by Membersof Parliament and of widespread speculation in the country. Dr. Steyn has doneeverything which political ingenuity could devise to strengthen his position. Hehas gone out of his way to propitiate the most diverse sections of opinion on theGovernment side and in his attitude towards the Opposition he has pushed thepolicy of appeasement &quot; to its possible limit. If a vote were held in theUnited Party caucus at this moment he would no doubt obtain an overwhelming majority; but since General Smuts, attheage of 73, has more physical vigour anclintellectual grasp than most men twenty or thirty years his junior, there is ageneral hope and expectation that he will continue as leader of the United Party
and head of the Government for many years to come. Many who had succumbedto Dr. Steyn&apos;s persuasiveness and agreeable salesmanship are now beginning to doubt his strength of character or his real capacity for a. post so difficult as thatof Prime Minister in the anxious post-war years.16. The session saw the return to Parliament of Mr. Waterson, who sincethe outbreak of war had been in London as the Union&apos;s High Commissioner.He entered the Cabinet as Mr. Stuttaford&apos;s successor at the Ministry of commerce and Industries. He was obviously feeling his feet and was careful to keep in the background. He took no part in general debates but handled competently thebusiness of his Department in the House. There are some who hope that he mayin time emerge as the leader of whom the &quot;English-speaking section has so long been in need, and that he may even develop, given favourable circumstances, intothe first Prime Minister of British descent. That, of course, is speculation ofthe long-distance kind. Mr. Waterson is clearly popular with Afrikaans aswell as English-speaking South Africans.17. I am pleased to report that Mr. Lawrence, whose political stock had lastyear been declining, has made a striking recovery. He was guilty of an errorof judgment in his decision to constitute a Coloured Advisory Council, which thecoloured people, influenced by a somewhat factitious agitation, interpreted as asegregationist move; but he mitigated the effect of his mistake with some agilityby reducing the scope and functions of the Council and by a strenuous denialthat his plan was anything but what it seemed, namely, an attempt to establish anofficial. channel of communication between the Cape Coloured people and theGovernment. As Minister of the Interior it fell to him to pilot the Indianpenetration Bill through Parliament; this he did with real ability, restraint and tact. His handling of the Bill was conciliatory and he was careful not togive offence to the local Indians or to the Government of India in what was avery difficult situation. He also fully held his own against Mr. Hofmeyr in both caucus and Cabinet, much to the latter&apos;s chagrin.18. It is hardly too much to say that the progress of the session confirmedmost people&apos;s worst fears about the appointment of Major van der Byl as Ministerof Native Affairs, in the place of Colonel Deneys Reitz. In his reply toMrs. Ballingets motion urging fundamental changes in the Union&apos;s native policy,he showed himself quite incapable of understanding the implications of policy :even pro-Government papers remarked that his speech was &quot; inadequate.&quot;More than once he foolishly played up to the race prejudice of the Opposition;and he gratuitously confirmed the Governments adherence to the general policyof &apos;&apos; segregation &apos;&apos; which General Smuts himself only a year before had declared to be hopelessly out of date. Major van der Byl has had no previous contact with or knowledge of native affairs, the environment of his farm at Bredasdorpbeing exclusively Cape Coloured. As Minister for Native Affairs he made a badbeginning.19. Of the other Ministers it need only be said that Mr. Sturrock, theMinister of Railways and Harbours, confirmed his reputation as an able andsound administrator; and that Colonel Collins, the Minister of Agriculture and food Controller, made such a muddle of the Union&apos;s food policy that at one time it was. believed that he had been prevailed upon to retire after the generalelection; but he has now receded from that beneficent intention. Senator Conroy,the Minister of Lands, gave the Opposition some useful election ammunition byhis attacks on the administration of the Kakamas, settlement scheme by theDutch Reformed Church, though there was much substance in his accusation ofvenality on the part of the august hierarchy. Mr. Madeley, the Minister OfLabour, was hardly heard of at all, and, indeed, spent much of the session inJohannesburg in winning over the support of his leftTwing followers to theelection agreement with the United Party. Colonel Stallard&apos;s only notable inter-vention in debate was a deplorable attempt to exploit race prejudice against theIndian population of Natal, a lead inevitably followed by his small band ofstalwart reactionaries.20. Of the private members of the Government coalition, none wasdistinguished by any special contribution to the business of the House. Mr. LeslieBlackwell, K.C., who for many years has performed useful work as chairman ofthe Public Accounts Committee and has been effective in debate on financial measures, has at last received the reward for faithful service of appointment tothe Transvaal Bench. It was unfortunate that his last weeks in the house should have been marred by an outburst when he strongly criticised those soldiers
who took their complaints to Opposition members as &quot;skunks in uniform.&quot;Mr. Long, a former editor of the Cape Times, who has made several useful contri-butions to debates on matters of constitutional significance, has been refused theUnited Party nomination for the Gardens division of Cape Town, which he hasrepresented since the general election of 1938. While he had done much less than had been expected of him, his loss to Parliament is a serious one, for it means yet another reduction in the diminishing group of members competent to representthe views of a large section of South Africans of British descent.21. It is generally admitted that the outstandingly successful private member of the session was Mrs. Ballinger, one of the three natives&apos; representa-tives. Her Parliamentary style has matured and her speeches are attractivelypresented, lucid, pointful and well-reasoned. General Smuts himself, in private conversation, has declared that she is the best speaker in the House. Sheintroduced one of the most important debates of the session with an urgent pleafor a recasting of the official native policy of the Union frankly to accept, and tomake provision for, the rapid, rise of a permanently urbanised native populationbased on industry. She and her colleagues were the only members to cast theirvotes against the Indian Penetration Bill; and their stout defence of liberalprinciple in racial matters throughout the session received a striking tribute whenDr. Malan Mr. Louw and other leaders of the Opposition parties singled them out for embittered personal attack and warned them that.the Nationalist Party,when it comes to power, will seriously consider the abolition of the exiguousspecial native representation as an &quot; experiment that had failed.&quot; Mrs. Ballingeris conspicuous and exceptional among back-benchers in her realisation of the major problems confronting the Union of South Africa after the war, and in the courage and moderation with which she has lost no opportunity of endeavouringto educate public opinion. Her ideas and policy are objective and her own.Emphatically, she is a principal rather than an agent. In knowledge and abilityshe outdistances the other native representatives in both Houses of Parliament.She is a valuable figure of light in the public life of South Africa.22. In the absence of any very controversial legislation, it was not surprising that Dr. Malan and the official Nationalist Opjjosition found their chief interest during the session in preparing the way, by judicious propaganda,for their election appeal to the country. Dr. Malan, forsaking the familiarground of political and constitutional questions, introduced a long motionsetting out the Nationalist Party&apos;s policy on economic and social matters. this included State control of key industries and of the banking system, a Statehousing scheme and medical service and the acceptance by the State of responsi-bility for providing work for the European unemployed. Two years before,, theofficial Opposition motion of the session had pressed for withdrawal from thewar. Last year Dr. Malan laid down the Party&apos;s programme for the achievement of a republic. It is significant of the change that has come over the war prospects of the Allies that this year the Opposition should tacitly accept the certainty of an allied victory, and frame a policy which by implication envisages the continuance,in the forseeable future at least,, of the present system of Government in theUnion. In view of the Governments apparent inability to come forward with&apos;any well-considered and comprehensive plans of social and economic progress, andof the. intense conservatism of Mr. Hofmeyr&apos;s financial dictatorship, it was undoubtedly a shrewd decision on the part of the Nationalists to concentrate on social issues. But long absorption in the commonplaces of political and consti-tutional debate has not been a good training for the discussion of social andeconomic problems; and it was clear from the speeches in the ensuing debate thatthe Nationalist.leaders were on unfamiliar ground..23. The other principal Opposition demonstration of the session took placeon Mr. Eric Louw&apos;s motion calling attention to the dangers of Communist activity in the Union.and demanding the suppression of the.Communist Party and the deportation of its leading members. This was a patent attempt to dress up-ina new guise the old bogy of a black revolution in South Africa and to use it tostampede the more ignorant part of the electorate into the Nationalist kraal atthe general election. It was fully dealt with in my despatch No. 144 of the16th April.24. Released by the certain prospect of Allied victory from the necessity ofplacating Germany, Dr. Malan and his friends were able to re-affirm their demo-cratic standpoint, and to intensify their attacks on the forlorn groups of Nazisympathisers in the Union. Mr. Pirow made infrequent and gloomy appearancesin the House, and his only remark of consequence was to the effect that he was
&quot; sick of the whole business,&quot; and had no intention of returning to Parliamentafter the election. He is now an embittered and frustrated lawyer politician,whose gamble on a German victory has led him to disaster. His personal hold onhis exiguous group of followers in the New Order group in Parliament has notice-ably relaxed. Even his personal appearance has changed. Instead of the rathercocky Mr. Pirow of pre-war years an older shrunken figure, resembling a huntedfox, haunts the lobbies and dining room of the House of Assembly. Many mem-bers of the New Order group are in open revolt against his fiat, that no membersof the New Order should stand for re-election : his chief lieutenant, the ReverendC. W. M. du Toit, has left the group and is standing as a &quot; people&apos;s unity &quot; candi-date against Mr. Strydom, leader of the Transvaal Nationalists, at Waterberg.Another. Mr. Grobler, is standing for re-election in his present constituency ofBrits.25. The Afrikaner Party also made an ineffective showing. One of its members, the representative in the House of Assembly of Johannesburg West,made a recantation of his opposition to the war and crossed the floor to an incon-spicuous seat on the Government side. Mr. Havenga, the Party&apos;s extra-Parlia-mentary leader, was in Cape Town for a large part of the session trying to stop the process of disintegration. His influence was sufficient to prevent anyfurther defections, but not enough to inject renewed spirit into his disconsolatefollowers. He made a tentative approach to Dr. Malan for an election agreement which would have ensured Nationalist support for Afrikaner Party members inthe seats they now hold; but this was summarily rejected by the Nationalists,who were not concerned to bolster up the fortunes of a declining group, andwould not consider anything but unconditional surrender by Mr. Havenga andhis friends. It was clear from Dr. Malan&apos;s attitude that his object was not somuch the formation of a united Opposition front for the coming elections as thecomplete elimination of rival groups and the establishment of the nationalist party under his own leadership as the &quot; political front &quot; of Afrikanerdom. Theposition on the eve of the election is that the Afrikaner Party has already put upcandidates against the Nationalists in thirteen constituencies in the Orange PfeeState and about five in the Transvaal; and that the Ossewa Brandwag is backingrebellious members, of Mr. Pirow&apos;s group as &quot;national unity&quot; candidatesagainst Malanites in two or three Transvaal constituencies, or is even openlyputting up its own anti-war candidates in potentially Nationalist seats.26. The main legislative business of the session was confined to the financial measures connected with the Budget. The only other legislation of interest wastwo measures piloted without much grace through Parliament by Mr. Hofmeyr,designed to increase State supervision of insurance companies and building societies.27. An interesting position has arisen with regard to the Speaker&apos;s seat.Mr. Jansen won the Vryheid seat in Natal at the last election as a member of thepre-war &apos;&apos; Pusion &apos;&apos; Party; but his antecedents are Nationalist, and if he were forced by United Party opposition to contest the seat he would have to declarehimself a member of Dr. Malan&apos;s party. He has been an excellent Speaker-probably the best to have presided over the House of Assembly since Union; andat the close of the session tributes were paid to his impartiality and integrity byleaders of all parties in the House. It would.be a calamity if his services were lost to the House as a result of party defeat in  he election; at the same timesympathy can be felt with the United Party&apos;s reluctance to let a seat go bydefault to the anti-war Opposition, even if there is only the most remotepossibility of the Speaker having to give a casting vote in a matter of vitalprinciple. Many remedies for the difficulty are being discussed; but the UnionParliament seems no nearer than the House of Commons to finding a solution whichwill both remove the anomalies from the Speaker&apos;s position and safeguard the democratic rights of electors in his constituency.28. I am sending copies of this despatch to the High Commissioners for theUnited Kingdom in Ottawa, Canberra and Wellington.I have the honour to be,Sir,Your most obedient, humble servant,HARLECH, High Commissioner.
