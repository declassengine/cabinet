(43) 246-and theResolutions of the Middle Eastern War Council W.P. (43) 247 emphasize the seriousness of the position in Palestine which has already been exposed in the memoranda of the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and for Foreign Affairs W.P. (43) 192 and 200. In these papers, although proposals are made forcertain immediate action in relation to security measures in Palestine and Zionistpropaganda in the United States, the adoption of any positive and long-term policy is deprecated mainly owing to our preoccupation with the war. I do notthink that we can afford to leave the position where it is. The evidence seems toshow that there is every probability of our being faced with violent action by either or both Jews and Arabs. We shall have the thankless task of keeping order and will be blamed by both sides.2. It appears that the Zionist movement in Palestine has fallen under thecontrol of reckless fanatics. If they attempt to gain their ends by violence theresults will be disastrous to the Jews all over the world. No one but a visionaryimagines that Palestine can absorb all the Jews, even if they were willing to go.Millions will desire and be obliged to live in Gentile lands in Europe, Americaand other &quot;continents. They will depend for their restoration to their old&apos;homes,for their continuance in their present or for their settlement in new homes on the goodwill of the United Nations, especially of Britain, the United States and russia. We should, I think, endeavour to bring to bear on the Zionists theinfluence of those Jews who intend to live in Gentile lands.3. But we ought to endeavour to arrive now at a definite policy forPalestine, not only as concerns the relationship between Jews and Arabs in thatcountry, but as part of the larger question of the future of the Jewish and Arabraces. We should, I think, as soon as possible, discuss the whole problem with, theUnited States. As a first step I suggest that a Cabinet Committee should be setup to consider and report on the Palestine problem and the interconnected Jewishand Arab problems.C. R. A.23rd June, 1943.[25616]
