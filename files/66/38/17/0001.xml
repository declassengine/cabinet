Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.SECRET.W.P. (43) 267.23rd June, 1943.WAR CABINET,STATUS OF TIBET.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and . Secretaryof State for India. . ATHERE have been several recent indications that the Chinese government intend to press their claim that Tibet is part of China,, and the point is likely tocome up whenever any question affecting Tibet is under discussion with theChinese Government.We accordingly feel it desirable that those of His Majesty&apos;s representatives who may be concerned should have guidance as to the line which they shouldtake regarding the status of Tibet. Subject to the approval of the War Cabinet,we propose to instruct them to deal with the matter if necessary on the basisoutlined in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of the appended note. It will be seen that theline proposed will avoid committing us to recognition of Chinese suzerainty overTibet unconditionally and independently of Chinese acceptance of Tibetanautonomy. Authority is also sought for the proposal that if the Chinese doattempt to upset Tibetan autonomy we should warn them that perseverance inthat course would cause us to consider withdrawal of our recognition of Chinesesuzerainty.A. e;l. S. A.23rd June, 1943.UNTIL the Chinese Revolution of 1911, Tibet acknowledged the suzeraintyof the Manchu Emperors and a measure of control from Peking which fluctuatedfrom military occupation to a mere nominal link. Since 1911 Tibet has enjoyedde facto independence. His Majesty ^Government made repeated attempts after1911 to bring the Chinese Republic and the Tibetan Government together on thebasis that Tibet should be autonomous under the nominal suzerainty of China,but these attempts always broke down on the question of the boundary betweenChina and Tibet, and eventually in 1921 His Majesty&apos;s Government presented the Chinese Government with a declaration to the effect that they did not feel justified in withholding any longer their recognition of the status of Tibet as an autonomous State under the suzerainty of China, and that they intended dealingon that basis with Tibet in the future.2, The Chinese Government have since 1921 attempted to an increasing extent to import some substance into their suzerainty over Tibet, while theTibetans repudiate any measure of Chinese control. Recent references of theChinese Government to the subject come near to a claim that they are entitledto treat Tibet much like any Chinese province. Thus, last year they proposed,contrary to the wishes of the Tibetan Government, to post officials in Tibet to supervise the organisation of a supply route to China, and when Mr. Eden wasin Washington in March Dr. T. V. Soong said in connexion with this route thathis Government had always regarded Tibet as part of the Republic. Early inMay the Chinese Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs replied to an enquiry by12069   [25615]
Sir H. Seymour regarding reported Chinese troop movements against Tibet by saying that in Chinese eyes Tibet is part of China and that the Chinese Govern-ment would probably feel that a foreign Government had no more right to interestthemselves in Tibetan affairs than in those of the Provinces of China proper. Ata meeting of the Pacific Council on the 20th May, Dr. T.. V. Soong again contended that Tibet is part of China, to which the Prime Minister replied that no onecontested Chinese suzerainty.3. We have promised the Tibetan Government to support them in main-taining the practical autonomy of Tibet, which is of importance to the securityof India and to the tranquillity of India&apos;s north-east frontier. On the other hand,our alliance with China makes it difficult to give effective material support toTibet. It is therefore desirable so far as possible to prevent the dispute betweenChina and Tibet regarding the latter&apos;s status coming to a head at present.4. Nevertheless, at some stage discussion between ourselves and the ChineseGovernment regarding Tibefs status is probably inevitable. In this discussionour recognition of China&apos;s suzerainty over Tibet is a handicap, in that theChinese Government can argue that suzerainty involves some degree of control.It is therefore suggested that we should in any such discussions take the followingline in so far as their circumstances render it necessary : i    (a.) We should point out that Tibet has in practice regarded herself asautonomous and has maintained her autonomy for over 30 years.(b) We should state categorically that neither His Majesty&apos;s Government northe Government of India have any ambitions in Tibet other than themaintenance of friendly relations.(c) We should recall that our attitude has always been that we recogniseChinese suzerainty, but&apos; that this is on the understanding that Tibetis regarded as autonomous. We should avoid any unconditionaladmission of Chinese suzerainty.(d\ We should state that this is still our position; and any amicable arrange-ment which China felt disposed to make with Tibet whereby thelatter recognised Chinese suzerainty in return for an agreed frontier and an undertaking to recognise Tibetan autonomy would be welcomed by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India. The two latter Governments would be glad to offer any help desired by both parties to this end.5. The foregoing would make it clear that we do not feel ourselvescommitted to regard China as the suzerain unless she in turn agrees to Tibetanautonomy. If possible, for the present, it would be better to leave it at that, eventhough the Chinese may try to get round it in some way. But at a later stageit may prove necessary to add that: (e) If the Chinese Government contemplate the withdrawal of Tibetanautonomy, His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Government of Indiamust ask themselves whether in the changed circumstances of to-dayit would be right for them to continue to recognise even a &quot;theoreticalstatus of subservience for a people who desire to be free and have, infact, maintained their freedom for more than 30 years.. 6. It is proposed to embody the proposals in this note in a telegram toflir H. Seymour in order to provide him in connexion with the reported Chinesetroop movements on the Tibetan border with guidance regarding our view ofthe status of Tibet..
