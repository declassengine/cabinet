Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.Copy No.WAR CABINET.IMMIGRATION INTO PALESTINE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN accordance with the conclusions reached by the War Cabinet in December1942 (W.M. (42) 168th) regarding the immigration into Palestine of Jews fromthe Balkans, I announced in the House of Commons on the 3rd. February, 1943,that the Bulgarian Government had agreed to allow 4,000 Jewish children with500 adults to leave that country for Palestine. I added that his Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment Would be prepared, provided the necessary transport facilities could bemade available, to continue to admit into Palestine Jewish children with a propor-tion of adults up to the limits permissible for the five-year immigration period ending the 31st March, 1944. . The numbers involved amounted to approximately29,000.2. Since that date negotiations have been in progress on the question oftransport and on the method which should be adopted in Bulgaria for the nomina-tion of these immigrants. On the 27th May we learnt from the Protecting Powerthat the Bulgarian Government, clearly under German pressure, had closed, the bulgarian-Turkish frontier to all Jews. The Swiss Government has been asked toleave the Bulgarian Government in no doubt that if they persist in refusing toallow the 4,000 Jewish children and. the 500 adults to leave it would be regardedas a flagrant breach of an undertaking. The Bulgarian Government have alsobeen asked whether it is their intention to deny passage to all Jews whatsoeveror only to those not covered by an approved scheme. No satisfactory reply hasbeen received, and I can only regard it as doubtful whether they will keep theirpromise. They have said that they will compile lists themselves and that whencomplete they will inform the Swiss Government. The Bulgarian Governmentis now being asked to state categorically how many women and children theywill be prepared to allow to leave and when. The Swiss Charge d&apos;Affaires inSofia has, however, reported that German police turn back ail Jews .who attemptto cross Bulgarian frontiers into Turkey. The Jewish Agency in the meantimehave suggested that if the Bulgarian scheme collapses we should try to get theRoumanian Government to let a similar number of Jewish women and childrenleave their country. Ah approach was made accordingly through the swiss government on the 11th June, but no reply has so far been received, fromBucharest. I doubt whether this scheme will have any better chance of success,for it is clear that the German policy is to refuse to allow any Jews to leavecountries under their control except for a qtoid pro quo by way of exchange oftheir nationals, to which His Majesty&apos;s Government could not agree. This wouldmean, in effect, there could now be no legal immigration to Palestine direct from bulgaria or other enemy-occupied countries.3. The existing policy approved by the Cabinet (W.M. (42) 64th Conclusions)is (a) that all practical steps shall be taken to discourage illegal immigration into palestine and no steps whatever shall be taken to facilitate the arrival of jewish refugees in Palestine, (b) future shiploads of illegal immigrants who neverthe-less succeed in reaching Palestine shall be landed, placed in detainment camosand those who pass security and. economic absorption checks shall gradually loereleased against the current half-yearly immigration quotas.In practice any Jewish refugees escaping over&apos; the frontier into turkey and who do not attempt to go to Palestine by sea have been sent to Cyprus.  This[25630] &quot;SECRET,W.P. (43) 277.2Qth June, 1943.
is unsatisfactory because of transport difficulties and the fact there is onlyaccommodation for 400 refugees there.4. As under present conditions it seems likely that there can now be no legal immigration from Balkan countries, I think that a change of policy to meetthe new situation is essential and my proposals are :--(a) In future all Jews, whether adults or children, who may succeed inescaping to Turkey will be eligible (after a preliminary security checkin Turkey, which I hope can be arranged) for onward transport to palestine where they will be placed in camps, go through a furthersecurity check, and if found satisfactory will be gradually releasedas legal immigrants against the current half-yearly immigrationquotas.(&amp;) This policy will also apply to Jews who manage to escape to other neutral countries; but where they have escaped to countries in which they aresafe they will normally remain there. Thus, the Jews at present inMauritius, Cyprus and Spain would remain there (unless, as is hoped,arrangements can be made in the case of Spain to remove them for the duration of hostilities to Allied territory in North Africa) and onlyin very special cases and for very special reasons would authoritybe given for any onward transport to Palestine.(c) The numbers to be admitted under these new proposals will not entailany increase in the total number of immigrants permissible for theperiod ending the 31st March, 1944.(d) NO public announcement of this policy will be made as secrecy isessential in the interests of the refugees themselves; but I should tell the Agency in confidence of these proposals.\e) These new arrangements are necessitated by the new situation which has, arisen in the Balkans and must be regarded as subject to reconsider a-&quot; tion at once if any serious change takes place, such as. for example,any collapse of the Balkan States.5. It may be argued that by the adoption of these proposals, we should beencouraging illegal immigration, but, when all possibilities of legal immigrationhave been destroyed by the Nazi ukase, this must be accepted- if we are not torefuse all refuge to those escaping from Nazi cruelties.Certainly immigration being uncontrolled will be on less orderly lines, butI doubt whether the number of refugees, who manage to escape, will be large enough to make this a serious problem.In any case I do not think that we can do less than I propose, in view of thenew situation which will be created in the likely event of the collapse of the bulgarian scheme. I have consulted the Minister of State and the HighCommissioner, who see no alternative to those proposals.6.   I ask my colleagues to approve the proposals in paragraph 4.O. S.Colonial Office,2Qth June, 1943.
