Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 1943.CONFIDENTIAL.W.P. (43) 293.5th July, 1943.Copy No.WAR CABINET.WARNING TO NEUTRALS NOT TO GRANT ASYLUM to enemy LEADERS AND WAR CRIMINALS.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.I HOPE that I shall not be suspected of any sentimental tenderness for eitherHerr Hitler or Signer Mussolini (I make use of these two names only, since theyare the arch-criminals and all others are only their subordinate accomplices) if i venture to question the wisdom of circulating at the present time a threat to neutral countries against the reception of war criminals as suggested in w.P. (43) 286 of the 29th June.2. In the first place, I would suggest that, as it is rash to count chickensbefore hatching, so it is dangerous to argue about the disposal of criminals before they are caught.3. In the second place, ought we to insist upon the delivery of the bodiesbefore we have ourselves decided what we are going to do with them ? I am not aware that the United Nations have agreed upon any policy as to the fate of herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini, if these two individuals should becomeprisoners of State as the result of unconditional surrender. Surely we should decide what we are going to do with them before we insist upon their being handedover to us ?4. If we have learnt very little from our mistakes in the past, let us at least be guided by our successes., I should say, remembering Chinese Slavery and theZinoviev letter, and not forgetting Jenkins&apos;s ear, that &quot; Hang the Kaiser &quot; wasthe &quot;stupidest slogan that ever won a general election. Fortunately, the stubbornrefusal of the Dutch to deliver the goods prevented Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s post-warAdministration from implementing their election pledge. I do not know howclosely they had examined the embarrassments that they might otherwise haveencountered.5. There &quot;exists a reluctance in this country to condemn a man without trial a reluctance which would doubtless prove weak in the intoxication of victory,but which would certainly grow stronger in the sombre sobriety of post-warenvironment. But by what code and before what tribunal can the Head of aconquered State be tried by his victorious opponents? Who would draw theindictment? Who would answer the defence based upon the principle ofsalus reipublicm. suprema lex and supported by the plea that, according to hisown lights, mistaken as they may have been, the accused had done his best for hisnative*land ?6. A fair trial, involving the presence of international lawyers andconducted under the auspices of that nebulous figment, international law, woulddrag on interminably until it became a farce, in which the only sympatheticfigure would be the prisoner. The dock is a most advantageous position and hasoften shed glamour over the commonest criminals.7. Hitler himself has shown by his treatment of Schussnig that he properlyappreciates the difficulties of bringing a Head of a State to trial..8. If, therefore, trial be abandoned, there remains only the alternative of punishment without trial.   This would certainly shock the consciences of many[25685]
people at the time and many more in retrospect. There is, however, one classicprecedent, namely, the treatment accorded to Napoleon Bonaparte by the victorious Allies in 1815. For a century and a half England has borne the blame for the decision unanimously accepted by all the Allies, and by none moreenthusiastically than France, to send Napoleon to St. Helena. As a matter of fact, there is no reason why he should not have passed a far pleasanter time therethan that which Kaiser Wilhelm II spent at Doom his liberty was lessrestricted and the climate was superior. But with an eye to the future he pre-ferred to play the part of a martyr and upon those six years of captivity are basedthe Napoleonic legend, the Second Empire, and, to some extent, the latent hostilitywhich still exists between the French and English peoples. To confer upon hitler and Mussolini the honour of a similar captivity would not only elevate them in the eyes of their fellow countrymen, but would also incur the risk of their escape,which would be far more easily affected at the present time than in the nineteenth century.9. Nor would comfortable captivity satisfy the natural desire for vengeancewhich must be prevalent on the morrow of victory.10. The only alternative is capital punishment. There would probably befound some difficulty in discovering in any statute book a crime for which theHead of a State can be sent to the gallows. But, apart from legal difficulties,what is likely to be the effect of carrying out in cold blood, months after the war was over, the execution of Hitler and Mussolini ? They would possibly, I should say probably, meet their deaths with dignity, and their memories would beenshrined for ever in the hearts of their people.11. : Here again we can turn to history for guidance. Charles I wasexecuted; in eleven years Charles II was restored to the throne. James II was allowed to spend the remainder of his life as an honoured exile in a foreign country, and the cause of the Stuarts was lost for ever. Louis XVI was executed,and in ]twenty-one years his brother succeeded him; but Charles X and LouisPhilippe were allowed to die in exile and we have not yet seen the return of theBourbons. Wilhelm II was superficially an attractive personality. Had he facedhis accusers in a court of law and met his death before a firing squad he wouldhave become a legendary figure and inspired lasting affection. The knowledge,that he was cosily ensconced at Doom knocked the romance out of the story, andthe last thing that is likely in Germany to-day is a restoration of theHohenzollerns.12. Nor, surely, do we wish by punishing the arch-criminals to excuse theiraccomplices? Nothing could be more foolish, or more dangerous, than to thinkthat after we had punished the more prominent Nazis and Fascists we could takethe German and Italian peoples to our hearts and trust them never to do it again.13. But what, it may be asked, should be our policy with regard to thesebad men who have done so much evil to the world ? &apos;&apos; Wait and see &apos;&apos; is more often than not sound advice. There are three things that may happen -all ofwhich are worth waiting for and seeing and, in my submission, preferable tothreatening neutrals now with penalties which we should probably never impose.Should we, in fact, if the neutrals stood firm, be prepared to invade Switzerlandor Sweden in order to dig out some miserable Nazi rat ?14. The following are three possibilities : First,- these men may solve ailour difficulties by taking their own lives. Secondly, they may be torn in piecesby their own people, or fall, as Darlan did, at the hands of a courageous assassin.Thirdly, they may creep into some neutral country and drag out despised anddishonoured existences until their deaths hardly furnish an item of news.Disappointing as this last solution may appear to their contemporaries, it-wouldprobably prove the best from the point of view of posterity.15. There is one further consideration. Could we, as Allies of marshal stalin, go into court with clear consciences and spotless hands ?W --1 i M ; &apos; -;- I        &apos; &apos; &apos;. ;     -   D.
