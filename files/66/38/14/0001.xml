THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT -Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.SECRET. Copy No.    33W.P. (43) 264.23rd June, 1943.WAR CABINET.AFFAIRS ON THE COPPERBELT, NORTHERN RHODESIA.THE CASE OF Mr. MAYBANK.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. In view of possible political repercussions in this country, I feel I oughtto let my colleagues in the Cabinet know some recent developments with regardto the detention and deportation of Mr. Mayba,nk, late General Secretary of theNorthern Rhodesia Mine Workers&apos; Union.2. In September of last year the Governor, with the full support of his advisers, recommended that Mr. Maybank should be detained and subsequentlydeported. My predecessor, Lord Cranborne, after consultation with the PrimeMinister (and, I think, the Defence Committee), agreed to this course and thenecessary action was taken on the 5th October. It was then found that he hadbeen born here and not in New Zealand, as had been supposed, and the Governorrecommended that he should be deported to this country. After consultation onthe trades union aspect of the case with the Minister of Labour, I agreed to theaction proposed, and Mr. Maybank was deported in December and reached thiscountry at the beginning of March. Telegraphic correspondence with theGovernor leading up to Mr. Maybank&apos;s detention was circulated to members ofthe War Cabinet at the time, but a brief statement of the facts is included as an appendix.3. Immediately after Mr. Maybank&apos;s deportation I received a protest fromSir Walter Citrine, and recently, after hearing a statement by Mr. Maybank, he asked to be given an opportunity of getting the other side of the case from theColonial Office and was given full information, although, of course, in confidence.I had hoped, from previous indications, that this would satisfy him, but he remained unconvinced and reported the matter to the General Council of theTrades Union Congress. I have now received a letter from Sir Walter Citrinein which he says that the General Council feel very strongly that the case against mr.. Maybank has been deliberately worked up for the purpose of getting himdeported. They regard the action of the Governor as high-handed in the extreme;they are convinced that Mr. Maybank was deported on account of his TradeUnion activities; and they are not prepared to let the matter rest where it is atpresent. Sir Walter therefore asks me to reopen the matter with a view to justicebeing done to Mr. Maybank. It is clear that the Council have taken their decisionon an uncorroborated statement made by Mr. Maybank and Sir Walter Citrine&apos;personal opinion.   No new facts have been produced to me.4. The two main points made by Sir Walter Citrine and the Trades union council are that the Governor acted in a high-handed manner, and thatMr. Maybank was deported because of his Trade Union activities. The facts donot bear out either of these contentions. The Governor acted not only with theapproval of His Majesty&apos;s Government, but also with the full concurrence ofhis official and unofficial advisers, including Mr. Welensky of the northern rhodesia Railwaymen&apos;s Union, the leader of the local Labour party. The sugges-tion that Mr. Maybank was victimised because of his Trade Union activities isequally unjustified. The Mine Workers&apos; Union has always been given every facility by the Northern Rhodesia Government, a fact which is ensured by the[25613]
position as Director of Manpower of so prominent a local Trade Unionist as mr. Welensky. Moreover, the General Secretary of the South African MineWorkers&apos; Union,, after visiting the Copperbelt last year, stated that he did notconsider that the action taken by the Government was an attempt to break theTrade Union movement. The deportation was decided upon solely because ofthe paramount need for maintaining copper production and the danger thatMr. Maybank&apos;s activities, by deliberately fomenting agitation in an area whereracial tension makes industrial disturbances more dangerous, might seriouslyinterfere with that production. Mr. Maybank&apos;s&quot; deportation has eased thesituation on the Copperbelt, and as far as I am aware there is no local demandfor the decision to be reversed.5. There can be no question of altering the decisions which have been taken,and I should like to obtain the agreement of my colleagues to informing Sir WalterCitrine that in detaining and deporting Mr. Maybank the Governor acted withthe full support of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and that in the absence of any newfacts I can see no ground for reconsidering the decision then taken.O. S.Colonial Office,23rd June, 1943.
APPENDIX.       -     , - &apos;   &apos;   &apos;In September last, the Governor reported that there had been a serious deterioration in the situation on the Copperbelt. A strike had previously broken,out in the Katanga Province of the Belgian Congo on the 7th August, apparentlyas a protest against the arrest by the Congo Government of the President and secretary of the Katanga Mine Workers&apos; Union. (There was evidence that thePresident had made a wager that Germany would win the war and expressedthe hope that there would be a German victory.) Work was resumed on the10th August. There was a further partial strike on-the 3rd September, but allthe men had returned, to work by the 19th September. Representatives of theNorthern Rhodesia Mine Workers&apos; Union were in touch with the Katanga Union,and there is evidence to suggest that the Northern Rhodesia, delegates gave anundertaking that they would be prepared to stage a strike if necessary to demon-strate solidarity with the Belgian workers. There was also evidence thatMr. Maybank was endeavouring to seduce the railwaymen of Northern and southern Rhodesia from the discharge of their duties. He sent a telegram tothe Governor-General of the Belgian Congo stating that, unless the difficulties inthe Katanga were settled in favour of the Katanga Union, he would open negotiations with the Rhodesia Railwaymen&apos;s Union with a view to holding upall railway traffic to the Congo. At the same time, he sent a telegram to the railwaymen&apos;s Union asking them to support his telegram to the Governor-General of the Congo and to agree that if necessary the railway would refuse to handle Congo passengers or goods. Mr. Maybank had also repeatedly hinted thathe had armed commandos organised in the background; and during a. visit to Lusaka he made a statement to Government representatives that a strike now on the Copperbelt would be a far more serious matter than on any previous occasion, as the workers were armed. He added the remark that 1,500 workers were in possession of arms. It had become clear that Maybank and certain of his supporters were deliberately fomenting agitation directed against the war effort,and the Governor, with the full support of his advisers, strongly recommendedthat Mr. Maybank should be detained under the Emergency Powers regulations and subsequently deported to the country of his birth.2. After his detention on the 5th October, Mr. Maybank lodged objectionsto the Advisory Committee, but the Advisory Committee, having heard them,confirmed the action taken by the Governor. The Governor then recommendedthat Mr. Maybank should be deported to this country as it was found that hehad been born here and not in New Zealand as had been thought. The Governor&apos;proposal was approved and Mr. Maybank was deported in December and reached this country at the beginning of March. The public reactions, both in northern rhodesia and South Africa, have not been unfavourable. There was no trouble in Northern Rhodesia itself and the Governor has recently reported that thingson the Copperbelt are much quieter since the. deportation. With regard to south Africa, the General Secretary of the South African Mine Workers&apos; Union,to which the Northern Rhodesia Mine Workers&apos; Union is affiliated, visited theCopperbelt in 1942 to make an investigation. On his return to South Africahe stated at an interview with the press that he did not consider that the action taken by the Government of Northern Rhodesia was an attempt to break thetrade union movement, that the miners seemed to be satisfied and that the action taken by the Governor was in the public interest. Recently it has been reportedthat the Conference of South African Trades and Labour Councils rejected,though by a narrow majority, a resolution protesting against the deportationand requesting the appointment of a Royal Commission.
