Printed for the War Cabinet.   July 19,43SECRET.W.P. (43) 297.6th July, 1943.WAR CABINET,WAR PENSIONS.Memorandum by the Lord President of the uouncil.I. Introduction.THE Minister of Pensions recently submitted to the Lord presidents committee a review of war pensions which he had carried out in the light bothof the recent Debates in the House of Commons and of representations receivedby him from his. Central Advisory Committee, from the British Legion and theBritish Legion (Scotland), as well as from many other sources.2. In the view of the Lord Presidents Committee, changes, in war pensions,as in other social services, should only be made when they can be shown, oh merits,to he justified. My Committee are, nevertheless, satisfied that the time has come when a number of changes must be made in the present system of. war pensionswith a view to correcting anomalies and to. meeting legitimate grievances. Havingconsidered the review of the Minister of Pensions from this standpoint, my committee have asked me to submit to the War Cabinet the recommendations which are set out in the following paragraphs.Il.-Fit for Service, Fit for Pension; Onus o,f Proof.3. The &quot; fit for service, fit for pension &quot; claim rejects any causal connec-tion between the invaliding disability and war service. Its acceptance wouldmean that a normal ailment pf civil life, which occurred whilst a man was in the armed Forces., though in np way caused or aggravated by war service, wouldentitle, him to compensation on the scale proper for a war disability. No doubt in course of time the claim would extend to cover the case of the man who broke-down in health for any reason at some period after the termination pf his war-service. .4: The view of the Committee is that the principle &apos;&apos; fit for service, fit for pension &quot; should pot be adopted and that the fact that a man had been accepted as medically fit for service should not be accepted as conclusive proof that,, in theevent of his subsequently leaving the Service on medical grounds, his disability hadbeen caused by his service.5. The Committee are also reluctant to recommend the adoption of anyprinciple, which implies that the function of the Minister pf Pensions is other th.anto review all the evidence impartially. This would, be the result of any amendmentof the Royal Warrant which put the Minister in the position of having an especialduty to produce evidence opposing the grant of war pensions in particular pases.s The Committee feel, however, that the fact that a man is accepted for service in a certain medical category can properly he accepted as presumptiveevidence that (a) at the time of acceptance he was fit for the kind of servicedemanded of men in that medical category, and (fo) in the event of his beingsubsequently discharged on medical grounds the deterioration which had takenplace imhis health was due to. his service. The adoption of this principle will notalter the position whereby the onus of proof lies, neither with the Minister ofPensions nor with, the ex-service man. Mprepy-er, ^ reaching his decision theMinister of Pensions will not be precluded from paying due regard to any otherevidence, including considered general medical opinion with regard to a[25702] copy No, ^
particular disease or class of diseases, which throws doubt on the presumptiveevidence of the medical category in which a man was placed at the time of his acceptance for service, or on the general presumption that service had played apart in the onset or development of the disability.If this view is accepted, effect could be given to it by the incorporation in theRoyal Warrant of a provision on the following lines which would replace theexisting entitlement provisions for both disablement and death : &quot; Entitlement. (1) The disablement or death of a member of themilitary forces shall not be accepted as due to war service for the purposesof this Our Warrant unless it is certified that (a) the disablement is due to a wound, injury or disease which (i) is attributable to war service; or(ii) existed before or arose during war service and has been and.remains aggravated thereby; or(b) the death was due to or hastened by (i) a wound, injury or disease which was attributable to war service; or(ii) the aggravation by war service of a wound, injury or diseasewhich existed before or arose during war service.(2) In no case shall there be an onus on any claimant under this OurWarrant to prove the fulfilment of the conditions set out in paragraph (1)and the benefit of any reasonable doubt shall be given to the claimant.(3) Where there is no note in contemporary official records of a materialfact on which the claim is based other reliable corroborative evidence of thatfact may be accepted.(4) Where an injury or disease which has led to a member&apos;s dischargeor death during war service was not noted in the medical report made on that member on his enlistment, a certificate under paragraph (1) shall be given- unless the evidence shows that the conditions set out in that paragraph arenot fulfilled.&quot;III. Rates of Pension.6. It is proposed that the rates of pension for death and disablementsustained in the present war should generally be assimilated to those in respect &apos;of the war 1914-18. This principle would be slightly modified in regard to therates paid to the widow in respect of her children. The 1919 rates were 10s.for the first, 7s. 6d. for the second and 6s. for the third and succeeding children.The comparable present rates are 9s. Qd.. 7s. and 5s. Qd. The rates paid by.theService Departments during the man&apos;s lifetime are 9s. 6^., 8s. Qd. and 7s. 6d.,and there has been considerable criticism of minor differences between the ratespaid during a man&apos;s lifetime and after his death to his widow. The committee epropose that, in future, the allowances paid to widows in respect of children should be the Service rates. This will remove a cause of constant friction andwill, on balance, be more advantageous, particularly to the hardest case of the widow with a large family.It is proposed that, to meet administrative convenience, the new rates should operate as from the first pay day in the week beginning the 16th August, 1943.IV. Accidents.7. Most accidents sustained by a man during service are accepted asattributable to service. If, however, an accident is sustained under the followingcircumstances, it is not at present accepted as being so attributable : (a) &quot; Walking out,&quot; cycling or motoring in his spare time.(b) Travelling to or from his home on leave of not more than 48 hours&apos;duration, unless the leave is of a compassionate nature.(c) At the place where he is spending his leave (other than injuries by enemy action).(d) Travelling to or from duty when living in accommodation privatelyarranged.(e) Travelling to or from meals outside the precincts of service premises.8. It is the Committee&apos;s opinion that the principle which should.be adoptedin this matter is that the State should accept liability for accidents occurring at
any time when the man is at the disposal of the State. In the case of service personnel it would follow from this principle that accidents would be accepted asattributable to service if sustained by a man under all the circumstances set out above with the exception of (c).9. If this principle is accepted in the case of Service personnel, its applica-tion to members of the Home Guard and of the Civil Defence Services will also have to be considered. The circumstances of these persons are, however, in some respects different from those of serving personnel and the application to them ofthe same principle would not, therefore, necessarily lead to the same results.V. Supplementation of Widow&apos;s Pensions.10.   With the revised rates of pension proposed under III s. d.A widow with one child, will receive ...      ...      ...      36 2A widow with two children will receive      .....    ...       44 8A widow with three children will receive    ...      ...       52 2A widow with four children will receive      ....      ...       59 8These rates are in certain circumstances difficult to defend, particularly in those cases where, during the man&apos;s lifetime, the regulated Service allowances havebeen supplemented by a War Service Grant. Various suggestions have beenconsidered with a view to improving the position. In the opinion of the Ministerof Pensions the case where the new rates will be most open to criticism will bewhere the widow has no option but to remain in occupation of accommodation forwhich she is paying a substantial rent and where during the man&apos;s lifetime herregulated allowances have commonly been supplemented by a War Service Grant.There is no easy solution to the problem and any proposal is open to objection on some grounds or may have embarrassing repercussions.11. In all the circumstances the Committee propose that the standardpensions of widows of Other Ranks should be supplemented by a sum equivalentto the excess of rent, including rates, over 8s. a week, the maximum supplementbeing 12s. a week which would be paid in the case of a rent of 20s. a week or over.The Committee are aware of the fact that the Reconstruction priorities committee have agreed in principle not to include in the Social Security Schemeany provision for the. variation of benefit, according to the rent payable by theindividual. They feel, however, that the special circumstances of these warwidows justify exceptional treatment and that any suggestion that it creates a precedent to be followed in the Social Security Scheme can be successfully resisted.12. The adoption of the proposal now recommended will mean that, on asimpler basis and one not involving a means test, the widow will in effect have extended to her the principle of the 18s. minimum unit standard adopted in the assessment of a War Service Granf. The effect of this principle is- that, aftermeeting certain standing charges (in the main rent), the wife of the serving manis guaranteed an 18s. minimum standard to clothe and feed each unit in herfamily.   Children for this purpose: count as a half unit.The. following table shows the improvement which would result in the case ofa widow with a rent of, say, 15s. a week.Present    Proposedrate. rate., &apos;       - &apos; -    .  - .\        ,    s\ d. s: d.Widow-i-one child ...      ...      ...      34 6 43 2Widow-i-two children      ...      ...      ...      41 6 51 8JWidow-I-three children    ...      ...&quot;    ...      47 ft 59 2Widow-I-four children     ...      ...      ...      52 6 66 8VI.- The Position of the Seriously, Disabled Pensioner xvko is - Unemployable.13. Most disabled; men are able to return to normal employment. There are,however, a small number of seriously disabled men who are unemployable onaccount of their pensionable, disability. The Committee consider that the special needs- of these men should be recognised, and that their standard rate of pension&apos;should be- supplemented to the extent of 10s. a week, bringing the total pension of the unemployable disabled man with a pension atTOO per cent, rate up to 60s.[25702] B
a week for a married man (including a man who has married since his injury-see Section VII below) and to 50s. for a single man. *VII. Post-Injury Marriage.14. At present a man receives an additional allowance for a wife andchildren only if the marriage took place before the date when the disability wassustained or aggravated. The widow&apos;s position is similar. (There is one mainexception : allowances are normally paid in respect of a wife and children whilsta man is undergoing treatment whatever the date of marriage.) This practicehas been maintained since the last War by successive Governments.The arguments adduced in favour of admitting post-injury marriage are : (i) The principle of admitting post-injury marriage has been accepted byall Dominion Governments.(ii) The fortuitous date of marriage, i.e., pre- or post-injury, should not affect the man&apos;s entitlement to a wife&apos;s allowance,(iii) The present arrangement discourages marriage and children. ;,Against this change it can be contended, that : (a) The State accepts and compensates for the family position as at the timewhen the disability was sustained.(&amp;) As pension is not related to earning capacity, the man normally inemployment draws his pension in addition to wages or unemploymentbenefit. His position is more favourable now than it was 25 yearsago owing to the wider and more generous scope of social servicebenefits.(c) In the case of the man who married before being disabled it can be saidthat he and his wife suffer a joint loss and that some additional allowance in respect of the wife is therefore reasonable. This doesnot apply to a marriage contracted after the loss has been sustained.(d) For some years to come the main beneficiaries from a reversal of thepresent practice would be the disabled men of the last war who havemarried in the last twenty years or so, have never drawn wife&apos;s orchildren&apos;s allowances, and have no anticipation of an unexpectedbenefit of this kind.15. The Committee recommend that the full claim for recognition of allpost-injury marriages should be resisted. On the other hand they feel that, inthis matter also, the special circumstances of the disabled man who is unemploy-able deserve special treatment. They accordingly propose that in future adisabled, unemployable man, who marries after the date of his disablement, should,in addition to the supplementation of 10s. referred to in the preceding section,draw the same allowances in respect of his wife as are payable in respect of a man who marries before the date of his injury.16. A further change which the Committee wish to recommend concernschildren&apos;s allowances. At present these allowances are only paid, even in the caseof pre-injury marriages, in respect of children born within nine months of thedate of the man&apos;s discharge from the Service. It is proposed that, henceforth,children&apos;s allowances should be payable to all disabled men, unemployable onaccount of their pension disability, in respect of all their children whatever thedate of their birth.r17. If these proposals are accepted there is one&apos; consequential change which,in the opinion of the Committee, must also be made. It is, in the view of theCommittee, impossible, in cases where a man dies of his pensionable disability,to deny a war pension to a widow who was eligible for a wife&apos;s allowance at thetime of his death. The Committee accordingly recommend that a pension shouldbe paid to the widow of an unemployable man who dies of his pensionabledisability.18. The Committee propose that these additional benefits should be independent of any special allowances made for &quot; Constant Attendance.&quot; Theyshould be related to the principle that additional payments are justified onlywhile the man remains unemployable and he and his dependants are ineligiblefor benefits under the social security scheme. While, therefore, casual earnings up to, say, 20s. per week might be disregarded, eligibility for these additional payments should cease if the man again becomes employable. Such cases wouldprobably be very few in number.
VIII. The Disabled Re-employed Service Pensioner.19. A Service pensioner, who is re-employed and becomes disabled, atpresent has the option of being treated as a war entrant without previous service or (if more favourable) of drawing the combined pension payable under peace-time regulations. The latter is made up of a service pension element and adisability pension element, and the peace-time rule, which has existed since 1921,is that the greater element is drawn in full and the lesser as to one-half (hence the term &quot; halving rule&quot;).The operation of this arrangement has caused considerable dissatisfaction.Owing to the fact that pension as a war entrant without previous service iscommonly more favourable than the pension payable under peace-time regulations,a man with long regular service who is re-employed and disabled frequentlyreceives the same rate of pension as a similarly disabled war entrant. Moreover,if such a man instead of being re-employed in the Armed Forces suffers a.warinjury as an ordinary civilian, or a war service injury as a member of a civil defence Force, he receives the war-time pension appropriate to a private soldieron top of his service pension.20. The Committee accordingly recommend that the &apos;&apos; halving rule &apos;&apos; shouldbe abolished and that the necessary consequential adjustments should be made inthe case of the still-serving regular (officer and other rank).It has been suggested that, if the &quot; halving rule &quot; were abolished, correspond-ing adj ustments would have to be made in the rates at which pensioners both inthe fighting services and in the civil service are re-employed. The general viewof the Committee is, however, that these cases are not analogous, since they involve no question of disability.IX. Parents&apos; Pensions.21. The Committee recommend that the present basis of the award ofParents&apos; Pensions should be maintained. They are opposed to the re-institution of a 55. flat rate of pension in respect of the loss of a son or daughter, irrespective of the circumstances of the parents. (A pension of this kind, though subject to various limitations, such as the age of the dead son, was awarded&apos; during and immediately after the last war. It was, however, condemned by the SelectCommittee of 1921, and no further, awards were made after 1924, althoughpensions already awarded were continued in payment.)22. The Committee do, however, recommend that the present maximum ratesof pension should be raised from 10s. for one parent, and 12s. Qd. for two parentsin normal cases, with an additional 6s. Qd. in exceptional cases, to 15s. for oneparent and 22s. Qd. for two parents, with an additional 7s. Qd. a week in exceptional cases-thus providing upper maxima of 22s. Qd. for one parent, and30s. for two parents, as against the present maxima of 16s. 6d. and 19s.respectively.The Committee also recommend that the extent of need should be moregenerously assessed... . X. Officers&apos; Family Allowances.23. The Committee recommend that the need qualification for the award of family Allowances with an officer&apos;s Disability Retired Pay should be abolished-..XI. Treatment Allowances.24. The Committee recommend that the &apos;&apos; normally employed &apos;&apos; qualifica-tion for the award of Treatment Allowances (the allowances paid whilst the manis under treatment, usually in hospital) should be abolished; and. that, after allowing for Health Insurance Benefit, a married man should be guaranteed aminimum cash allowance of 50s. a week, and a single man of 30s. a week, inaddition to free treatment.They also recommend that the arrangements which apply in those neurosiscases where the condition is not attributable to, or aggravated by, service,regarding the payment of allowances under the continuity of treatment procedure,should, with suitable safeguards, be extended to all cases regardless of the natureof the disability.They further recommend that, in the case of married men, certain increases should be made in the rates to be paid.
XII. AIternative Pensions.25. For some years, there has been a limited demand for some system of alternative Pensions, such as the provision contained in the 1914-18 WarWarrants -? ^e grant of considerably higher rates of pension, both to disabledmen and widows, where the pre-war earnings of the disabled or deceased menexceeded a certain figure.The Committee recommend that Alternative Pensions, based on pre-servieeearnings, should not be re-introduced.XIII. Summary of Recommendations.26.   The recommendations of the Lord President&apos;s Committee may besummarised as follows : (i) The principle &apos;&apos; fit for service, fit for pension &apos;&apos; should not be adopted(paragraph 4).(ii) The conditions regarding entitlement to pension should, however, be revised as proposed in paragraph 5 and the Royal Warrant should be amended accordingly (paragraph 5).(iii) The rates of pension for death and disablement sustained in the present war should generally be assimilated to those, in respect of the war1914-18 (paragraph 6).- (iv) In regard to accidents the principle should be that the State should accept liability for accidents occurring while the member of the forces is at the disposal of the State (paragraph 8).(v) The standard pensions for widows of other ranks should be supple-mented by a sum equivalent to the excess of rent- (including rates) over8s. a week, the maximum supplement being 12s. a week (para-graphs 10-12).(vi) The seriously disabled man who is unemployable on account of hispensionable disability should receive a special supplement of 10s. aweek (paragraph 13).(vii) The full claim for recognition of all post-injury marriages should be resisted (paragraph 15).(viii) The seriously disabled unemployable man who marries after the dateof his disablement should, however, draw a wife&apos;s allowance (para-graph 15).(ix) In the case of the unemployable man. children&apos;s allowances should be^paid in respect of all children including those horn more than 9 monthsafter discharge (paragraph 16).(x) A pension should be paid to. the widow of an unemployable map whodies of his pensionable disability (paragraph 17).(xi) In the case of the disabled re-employed service pensioner, the present-&apos; halving rule &apos;&apos; should he aholished and the necessary consequentialadjustments should be made in the case of the still serving regular(officers and other ranks) (paragraphs 19-20).(xii) The flat rate 5s. a week pension to parents should not be re-instituted.   ^     (paragraph,(xiii) The maxirn^m rates of pension for parents, should be increased, and theextent of need should be more generously assessed (paragraph 22).(xiv) The &quot; need &quot; qualification for the award&apos;of family allowances with anofficer&apos;s disability retired pay should be abolished (paragraph 23).(xy) The arrangements regarding the payment of treatment allowances shouldbe improved (paragraph 24).(xvi) Alternative pensions based pn pre-service earnings should not be re-introduced (paragraph 25).&apos;XIV. Conclusion.27. If the proposals summarised, above, are approved by the War Cabinet,it is propose,^ th^t they should be incorporated in, a&apos; White Paper to be presented to Parliament duririg the course of next week and. at any rate, some d^ays beforethe&apos;Debate&apos;on the Ministry of Pensions, Estimates, which it is, understood willtake place on or about the 20th Julv.J.
