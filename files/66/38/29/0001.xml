Printed for the War Cabinet.  June 1943.SECRET. - Copy No-W.P. (43) 279.28th June, 1943.WAR CABINET.CONSTITUTION OF MALTA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.FROM 1921 until 1933 (with an interval of about eighteen months in 1931-32).Malta enjoyed responsible government in all matters of purely local interest,Imperial interests being retained under the control of His Majesty&apos;s Government.This form of government was withdrawn in 1933, when the Nationalist party,then in power, refused, during a period of intensive Italian intrigue and propa-ganda in Malta, to give the Governor satisfactory assurances regarding theirpolicy towards the propagation of Italian culture and the teaching of the Italianlanguage in the schools.2. The present Constitution was introduced in 1939. It follows normal&quot; Crown Colony &quot; lines, and provides for a legislature with the Governor as president, eight official members, and two nominated and ten elected members.The withdrawal of responsible government, though in the circumstancesrecognised as inevitable, was a humiliating blow to the Maltese people, and theyhave always assumed that, after a suitable interval, they would again be allowedto manage their own affairs.3. The necessity for prolonging the life of the present Legislature, which isdue for dissolution in July, has led to a demand from all political parties.in Maltafor a statement of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government regarding thefuture constitutional status of the Colony. There are clear indications that,failing a declaration of intention to restore responsible government after the war(subject, of course, to suitable safeguards in respect of Imperial interests, the needfor which is fully recognised in Malta), a critical political situation will develop in the next few weeks.5. The Governor urges, and I strongly support him in this yiew, that such adeclaration should be made at an early moment by His Majesty&apos;s Government.On the one hand, the political situation in Malta, which led to the suspension ofthe old Constitution, has been wholly transformed by the war. The Italians arenow regarded with universal hatred and contempt and the pro-Italian influences,which were at the root of the political crisis in 1933, are no longer a seriousfactor in Maltese politics. On the other hand, in face of their achievementsduring the war and their great service to the Allied cause, it would be impossiblefor us now to contest the fitness of the Maltese people to manage their own internal affairs.6. I am strengthened in my view by reports I have received, both from theGovernor and from Miss Mabel Strickland, who is now back in this country, thatthere are signs that responsible people, who in the old days were unwilling totake part in politics, being now -prepared to play their part. There is, however,great danger that if the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government are not made clear in the near future, they will lose interest and relapse into their previouslethargy.7.   I should propose, therefore, that a public announcement should, be madeby His Majesty&apos;s Government at an early date in the form which appears in theappendix to this paper.   It will be seen that all matters of detail are left over[25642]
until after the war and that the detailed settlement of the difficult question offinance, which will then have to be made, is not prejudiced by this statement.Full reservation is made for all Imperial interests such as defence, &amp;c, and this reservation would also cover the language question.8. I therefore seek the approval of the War Cabinet for an announcement inthe terms set out in the appendix.O. fe.Colonial Office,28th June, 1943.APPENDIX.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have had under consideration certain representa-tions which have been made by the Elected Members of the Council of Governmentin Malta, who have asked for an announcement regarding their intentions inrelation to further constitutional development. Since the present Constitution of malta was&apos; inaugurated in 1939 the Fortress has successfully withstood a siege oftwo and a half years. During the siege the Island was subjected to heavy and sustained attacks from the air and to a food shortage of increasing gravity. Bytheir steadfastness and fortitude under the severe hardships thus occasioned thepeople of&apos; Malta, together with its gallant garrison, rendered services ofincalculable value to the Allied cause. His Majesty&apos;s Government have noted with particular satisfaction that throughout the whole of this period the Councilof Government continued to discharge its normal functions in relation to legisla-tion and the discussion of public affairs.For more than ten years, between 1921 and 1933, the people of Malta enjoyedfull legislative and administrative responsibility under the Crown in the conductof their internal affairs, the control of Naval and Military Services and of all matters appertaining to the position of Malta as an Imperial Fortress, ortother-wise affecting Imperial interests or policy, being reserved to the Imperial Govern-ment. It is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government that responsible governmentin the same sphere should again be granted to Malta after the war.It will not be possible while the war continues for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to undertake a detailed examination of the various constitutional,financial and administrative questions which must be resolved before responsible government can be introduced, nor can some of these questions, in particular thosewhich arise in connection with finance, be defined until the Malta Government are able to visualise more clearly the extent and the cost of the plans for reconstruc-tion and development with which they will be faced after the war. But it is theintention of His Majesty&apos;s Government, as soon as hostilities are brought to anend, that these matters should be pursued without delay, and that steps should betaken to consult responsible opinion in Malta with a view to giving expression asfar as possible to the wishes of the Maltese people regarding the form which thenew Constitution might take.
