Thedestruction is so extensive that only a superficial analysis of it has yet beenpossible and the cover is not complete. It is, however, immediately obvious thatthis city of over half a million inhabitants has suffered devastation on a scale which no previous bombing raid has ever approached. The entire central area iswrecked, and well over 1,000 acres are almost completely devastated. Manybuildings throughout the city have been disintegrated by H.E. and entiredistricts have been burnt out. In the area between the Rhine and the main railway, which suffered severely in the attacks of September 1942, at least 80 percent, of the built-up area has now been gutted. Smoke from fires still smoulderingwas visible in many parts of the city seven days after the attack.Damage to 21 identified factories within the city has already been established.The marshalling yards at Derendorf, the main railway station (badly hit inSeptember 1942), the goods station at Oberkassel, and the railway station buildings at Bilk have all been badly hit, so that transportation and relief are necessarilypresenting serious problems.  Prints Nos. 1-5 show some of the damage.[25643] &apos; b
Munster (11th/12th June).On the same night as the raid on dusseldorf 72 aircraft were sent to Minister,now of great importance as one of the main transportation centres through whichrelief to the Ruhr can come. Both night plots and day cover show that this com-paratively light attack was highly successful. Heavy damage has been^ done to both stations as well as to railway tracks and the surrounding industrial area.Print No. 6 refers.Bochum (12th/13th June).Day photographs show that extensive damage was caused by this attack.This was not on the same scale as that achieved in dusseldorf, but the centralcity area is destroyed and there is heavy devastation to the N.E. The factoryarea to the west has not yet been eliminated. Print No. 7 gives some details of damage.Oberhausen (14th/15th June).Cloud, height conditions were such that only Lancasters could be employedin this attack. Preliminary reports suggested that a good concentration was achieved and the German Communique admitted that considerable damage hadbeen done in Oberhausen.Cologne.This attack was also restricted by cloud height to Lancasters. It seems probable that the attack was somewhat scattered, but photographic evidence isstill lacking.Le Creusot (19th/20th June).It was known that production at the Schneider Works, Le Creusot, had been largely restored since the daylight raid of the 17th October, 1942, and wastherefore an important factor in Germany&apos;s diminished resources for theproduction both of armaments and locomotives. The Schneider Works were attacked by 196 aircraft; at the same time 26 aircraft attacked the TransformerStation at Montchanin. Preliminary reports indicate that both attacks weremade in excellent weather conditions and were highly successful.Results of Previous Raids.The Ruhr.There is abundant circumstantial evidence to show that the cities of the ruhr are now for the most part unfit for human habitation by civilised peacetime standards. In some areas water supplies have been drastically restricted by rationing. As Gelsenkirchen, which has not been heavily bombed, is includedin these, it may be assumed that the pollution of filter beds by the Moehne floodshas contributed largely to the production of the shortage.Travel to and from Dortmund has been suspended until the 1st July exceptfor those holding special permits, and the tram services, particularly in Essen,have been largely disrupted.Nazi propaganda is now designed to stress the fact that front-line, existencein the Ruhr can still be maintained, and no measures are being omitted whichwill tend to hold as much of the population as is indispensable to keep upproduction in the many plants and workshops which have so far escaped direct and heavy damage. Makeshift repairs to houses and public utilities would stillsuffice to provide the minimum standards necessary for physical subsistence, andthe tone of&apos; the German press leaves no room for doubt that these are being planned and carried out.The battle has therefore reached the point at which it is of extremeI importance for us to maintain destruction at a greater pace than the enemy canj  carry out even such reconstruction as will enable the bare physical needs of largenumbers of workers to be met:   This, coupled with the progressive wrecking of plants and factories, will break down the resistance of the Ruhr, which is probably the toughest in Germany.The Volkischer Beobachter on the 9th June carried the following : &quot; With terrible certainty the clear aims of the British and americans to destroy German dwellings and break the hearts of the population are becoming evident. The people of the bomb-scarred and threatened areas havetriumphed over everyday trivialities like soldiers. In them there is the willnot to capitulate even when faced with life in all its bitterness.&quot;This may be an exaggeration, but it is clear that to some extent at least Nazipropaganda has successfully produced a iront-line mentality in the Ruhr.   This
will be overcome by producing conditions under which a front line is no longertenable.Dortmund.Final assessment of the devastation revealed by photographs after the attackon 23rd/24th May confirms the view that success on a vast scale, was.achieved.Only two-thirds of the works of Hoesch A.G. are covered, but in this section22 buildings have been destroyed and a further 22 damaged. In the VereinigteStahlwerke 11 buildings have been hit. Three subsidiaries of Hoesch A.G. have suffered. In addition to the damage already reported in the main station, goodssheds, repair shops, rolling-stock and tracks in four other stations have been hit.Ground sources now report that the less successful attack on 4th / 5th May causedsuch damage to the track and signal boxes at the main station as to prevent anytrain from leaving on the following day. Two trains were then burnt out in thestation and heavy casualties caused. Further damage was done on 23rd/24th may to the municipal power station, the gas works, the main fire station, and the municipal car park.The most spectacular housing destruction is the gutting of at least 115 acres in the centre of the town. Large numbers of houses, including 53 workers&apos; huts,have been destroyed by fire and H.E. elsewhere. The most conservative estimate is that some 800 buildings and at least 1,250 houses have been completely destroyed or severely damaged. 1It is learnt that in the Hoesch Works the finished parts of 30 tanks of thelatest type (said to be over 50 tons) were severely damaged.Wuppertal.Photographic evidence of the overwhelming effect of the raid carried out onthe 29th/30th May is now available. Results will be dealt with in detail in thenext summary.Essen.Final assessment of the damage caused in Essen by the attack on the 27th/28th May reveals that in Krupps 6 machine shops were severely damaged and alarge part of the power plant serving the steam hammer sheds was destroyed.Other buildings hit included a foundry, a rolling mill, the Diesel motor shop andthe administrative offices. At Stoppenberg, a N.E. suburb of Essen, threecollieries and a factory producing nuts and bolts were hit, and further severe damage was done in Altenessen to the north. At Delwig, to the N.W. of Essen,a road bridge over the railway has been broken and there is considerable damage to the tracks.Jena.In the daylight attack on the 27th May on the Zeiss Works, a buildingproducing aircraft instruments was severely dainaged and another engaged inthe production of field glasses and stereo telescopes was damaged. Sixty-five ofthe workers in the factory were killed.Mining Results.The following successes are reported : During the second week of April a U-boat struck a mine and sank offLorient.   Attempts at salvage were not successful.On the 6th May the Danish commodities, 492 tons, was mined and sunk nearKattegat Syd Lightship.On the 7th May the cutter No. 164 Bodil was mined and sunk in thex Fehmarn Belt.On the 13th May the motor ship Svalen was mined and sunk north ofBrandso (Little Belt).On the 15th May the German motor ship A rusa was mined 15 miles off Hals.On the 15th May a German schooner was mined and sunk in theNorth Sea.&quot;  A.
