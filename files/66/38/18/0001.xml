MOST SECRET.W.P. (43) 268,23rd June, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.THE ORGANISATION OF COMMAND IN EAST ASIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.SUBJECT to a few comments which follow and to the concurrence of theViceroy, which will now presumably be sought, I am in whole-hearted agreementwith the scheme set out in the Prime Ministers Memorandum, W.P. (43) 253,&quot;dated the 2lst June. This scheme will, I am sure, result in a great and much-needed improvement in the arrangements of the United Nations for conductingthe war against Japan.2. My comments, with reference to the paragraphs of W.P. (43) 253, areas follows :. o.B. (iii). I think words should be added at the end of this sentence inorder to bring in the idea of consultation with the Government of India, so faras concerns forces which would normally be serving under their authority. the concluding phrase might run : &quot; forces as may be assigned to the East Asia theatrefrom time to time by arrangement with the Government of India so far as mayconcern them.&apos;&apos;&apos; In the last resort, of course, objections raised by the Governmentof India to the transfer of forces from the authority of the Commander-in-Chief,India, to that of the Supreme Commander would have to be over-ridden. Butthe Government of India have always so far taken the reasonable view and theyhave, indeed, been consistently helpful. There is no reason to suppose that this attitude will not continue and it would, be a mistake to offend their amour proprewhen there is no real necessity for doing so. .Paragraph 6.-For similar reasons of avoiding any appearance of short-circuiting the civil authority in matters in which it is directly concerned, I would^suggest the insertion in line 9 after &quot; Commander-in-Chief, India &quot; of the words&quot; and the Government of India.&quot; There might well result grave inconveniencesif the line were drawn without regard to considerations of civil administration.Paragraph 8. To avoid any unnecessary queries from India it would be well to insert in line 5, after &apos;&apos; North-West Frontier,&quot; the words &quot;including his present responsibilities in respect of the East Persia Supply route.&quot;Paragraph 9. The suggestion that the Viceroy&apos;s Ministerial Assistant willmanage under the Viceroy the munitions plants and other kindred establishments in India requires reconsideration. It appears to conflict with the principle laidclown in paragraph 3, namely, that the machinery for co-ordinating the provisionof stores and equipment to meet the needs both of the operational forces based on india and of the internal garrison already exists in the Government of India andin General Headquarters, India, and is, indeed, the only machinery which can carry out the dual task. The same principle appears in another form in (a) of the summary of the Principal Administration Officers&apos; views set out in Annex II.The munitions plants in India are managed by the Indian Supply DepartmentT25617]  &quot; &quot; 65...... *Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.
under the orders of the Supply Member of the Viceroy&apos;s Executive Council, andit would be constitutionally impossible for the Viceroy&apos;s Ministerial Assistant to share with the Supply Member this responsibility. Whether it would be comstitutionally possible or not to effect a transfer of the management of these plantsto His Majesty&apos;s Government for the duration of the war, this would be intoler-ably,clumsy from the practical point of view, as the work of the factories isinterlocked with the work of trade workshops; and, politically, any diminution of the responsibility of the Supply Member would be very undesirable. I am not aware of any practical reason for disturbing the present arrangement, which is working reasonably well, and would not Avork better if the organisation for theproduction of munitions in India were disintegrated. For all practical purposes,the Indian ordnance factories work to programmes communicated to them by theMinistry of Supply and/or the General Staff in India, and there is a branch ofthe London Munitions Assignment Board already operating in New Delhi to dealwith competing claims upon the supplies that come forward. The Viceroy&apos;sMinisterial Assistant will be in a position to make recommendations for anyimprovements in the present arrangements for the administration of munitions production in India, if he sees fit, whether on his own initiative or that of theSupreme Commander, and any such recommendations will receive due and promptconsideration. But I consider that anything bej^ond this would be a step in the wrong direction and only create confusion and friction.Paragraph 10. Apart from this particular point I am somewhat concernedby the possible implications of the phrases used in paragraph 9, &apos;&apos; Assistant of ministerial status&quot; and &quot;this Minister.&quot; If no more is implied than the advisability of giving the Viceroy the help of some person who has had experience in this country as a Minister, well and good. But I submit that it is not consti-tutionally possible, and would, lead to innumerable difficulties, to try to importinto the Indian hierarchy any person other than the Viceroy himself holdingthe position of a Minister in the United Kingdom Government. The assistantto the Governor-General for the disposal of points of controversy arising betweenthe Supreme Commander and the Indian Administration must surely derive his authority from the Governor-General, though, to the same extent as the Governor-General himself, and indeed under the Governor-General, he will be amenable to instructions from and guidance by His Majesty&apos;s Government conveyed by thestatutorily established channel.This involves consideration of the question of defining the relationshipbetwee^a the Supreme Commander (so long as he is located in India, at any rate)and IndiaiLA^chministration.Presumably a corollary to the adoption of the proposals in W.P. (43) 253will be the formulation of a directive to the Supreme Commander. Withoujtattempting to suggest the content of such a directive which falls more in theprovince of the Service Ministers than in mine I would suggest that, as it willhave to include some reference to the relations between himself and the Govern-ment of India and the Governments of other British territories which fall withinthe area of his Command in respect pi matters of political significance, it will benecessary to devise simultaneously corresponding instructions to those authorities as to the relations they should have towards the Supreme Commander..-This will lead up to the questions of the necessity of vesting some authority with the powers of a Minister of State in the Far Eastern area, and of the extentto which such powers should be vested in the Viceroy while the supreme commander is located in India.India Office, 23rd June, 1943.L.
