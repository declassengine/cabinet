Copy No.WAR CABINET;MAN-POWER.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AT the end of last year the War Cabinet determined, subject to review inMay 1943,- the distribution of the additional man-power likely to be available during the eighteen months ending the 31st December, 1943, for the Forces, the munitions industries, and certain other essential. industries and services. Thefollowing Table shows the distribution then authorised, and the progress made towards achieving it in the first nine months of the period, i.e., up to the31st March, 1943 :-Table I.Services.Royal Navy Men     ...      ......Women...Army Men     .........Women...R.A.F.-Men     .........Women ...Total-Men ...WomenIndustry.Admiralty ...Ministry of SupplyM.A.P. &apos;    ...      ... .    ...Other   essential   industries and servicesTotalGrand totalIntake orNet IncreaseAuthorised.(a)287363498018067816183111- 785031166521,651AchievedJuly 1942-March 1943.(Thousands.)130-218-9296-66914565-5Balance RequiredApril-December1943.156-817 152-411351-5571-8153-4244-229-66020-143-85050-- 98-359-66274-8OLOoo377-2651(a) The figures shown in this Table and throughout the calculations relate to gross intakefor the Forces and net increases in munitions and other industries.(b) In addition, about 130,000 workers have had to be found for the expansion of certain industries and services for which specific provision was not made in the War Cabinetprogramme (see paragraph 2 (c) below-). This demand has been met out of the total supply of 1,600,000 estimated to be available over the eighteen months up to the endof 1943.[25599]b
2.   The significant facts disclosed by this Table are :  (a) The Navy have called for less than half of their allocation during thefirst half of the period; but the bulk of the numbers allocated to the other two services over the. whole period have been supplied during the first nine months.The present allocation to the Army and R.A.F. (both men and women) will havebeen completed by the end of June&apos; and, if no further allocation is made to them,these Services will then begin to run down.(5) The changes contemplated in the munitions industries have proceededless rapidly.The labour force on aircraft production has increased during the first half ofthe period by only 143.800, as compared with the planned increase of 235,000.The labour force on the Ministry of .Supply programme increased by 20,500up to the end of March; and the total reduction to be achieved in the second halfof the period thus becomes 98,500.(c) It was contemplated that over the whole period of eighteen months therewould be an increase of 116,000 in certain essential industries and services otherthan munitions. It is now known that during the first half of the period certain other industries and services which were not expected to expand have, in fact,increased by about 130,000. The significant increases have been in the staffs ofGovernment Departments (including industrial staffs) and in the iron and steel industries. This group includes such important services as R.A.F. MaintenanceUnits and R.E.M.E. civilian workshops; and it represents a vital part of thenational war effort. This additional demand has had to be met, however, out ofthe supply of 1,600,000 men and women which was assumed to be available tomeet the authorised requirements of the Services and industry.3. Account must now be taken of certain changes in requirements whichhave been notified, and discussed with the Departments concerned, since theMinister of Labour furnished his report (L.P. (43) 115) on the progress made upto the 31st March, 1943, towards achieving the redistribution planned by the WarCabinet at*the end of last year.4. The Service Ministers have put forward additional demands, asfollows : Table II.Men. Women.Navy         .........         30,000 10,000Army         ...      ...       ....        155,000 28,000R.A.F..........        126,000 19,000Combined Operations     ...           3,300 2,000Total      ...      ....        314,300 59,000The basis of the additional Service demands is explained in the Memorandacirculated by the three Service Ministers (W.P. (43) 221, 272 and 273). Thedemand for Combined Operations is to cover certain requirements which couldnot be met by.the Services even if they received their new demands in full. this demand is made up as follows :  Table III.Men. Women.Additional intake into the Navy     ...      3,300Additional intake into the Army    ... ... 1,000Additional intake into the RA.F    ... ... 1,0003,300 2,000The total demand for the Forces is thus raised from 273,800 to 647,100.5.   Adjustments have also to be made in the requirements for industry.Admiralty. -A further 6,000 workers are required for merchant ship--building, to make good the loss resulting from the.transfer of certain slips tothe building of escort vessels, as recently approved by the Anti-U-boat WarfareCommittee. For this programme 8,000 men are required in addition to theexisting Admiralty allocation; but the total liability in 1943 is only 6,000.Ministry of Su-pply. The approved reduction in the labour force on Ministryof Supply work is 98,500; and, by the War Cabinet decision of the 21st April,
1943, this is now to be achieved by the end of September. The Ministry ofSupply have estimated that it should be possible, without any further reduction in programmes, to release an additional 7,000 workers during the last three monthsof the year, giving a total reduction of 105,500.. M.A.P.- The expansion authorised by the War Cabinet at the end of lastyear was 503,000. The net increase achieved during the first half of the period was only 143,800; and the Minister of Aircraft Production no longer asks thatthe whole of the balance of 359,200 should be provided. So many incalculablefactors are involved that it is impossible to give a precise forecast of the numbers required to achieve the full production programme; but the Minister considersthat at the peak the labour force should be something like 200,000 more thanthat employed on the 1st June, 1943. If this peak were to be reached by theend of 1943, it would be necessary to provide an additional 212,000 between 1st April and 31st December, 1943.Other Industries and Services. The balance of the allocation for these industries, &amp;c, made by the War Cabinet at the end of 1942 is 66,000. It isnot now expected that the whole of this will, in fact, be required for theindustries, &amp;c, then under consideration; but a. further allowance must now bemade for increases in certain other essential industries and services which atthe time of the earlier review were not expected to expand. The revised estimateof the total increase, from 1st April to 31st December, 1943, in all these industries, &amp;o, is 102,000.   A detailed estimate is given in the Appendix.6. Thus, on the basis of the latest estimates provided by the Departments,the total additional numbers to be supplied in the period from 1st April to31st December, 1943, are as follows u Table IV.Services.Royal Navy-men women .Army - % MenWomenR.A.F.-MenWomenTotal-Men ...Women(Thousands.)Balance ofAuthorisedIntake or net increase.156-817152-411-0-   -3501-5244-229-new-Demands.33-3*10 0155 029-0*126 020-0*314-359-0RevisedTotalDemand.190 1*27-1207-440-0*161 021-5*553-588-6Industry.Admiralty ....Ministry of SupplyM.A.P.&apos;Other   essential   industries and services total      ......Grand Total50-5-98-5359-266-0377-2651-056-5-105-5212-0102-0265-0912 1* This includes the additional demand for Combined Operations shown in Table III.7. The aggregate demand for the Services and essential industry is, there-fore, 912,100 men and women. In addition to this, however, we must on this occasion make specific provision for the replacement of normal wastage from-industry through death, retirements, &amp;c. Up to the present, the numbersentering full-time employment fronTyoung people leaving school, the unoccupied[25599] 2
classes; immigrants, and men and women discharged from the Forces, have been sufficient to offset this normal wastage and effect a net increase in the. total labour force. The progressive mobilisation of man-power was bound, however,to result, in the end, in conditions in which normal wastage from industryexceeded new intake. This stage has now been reached; and (for the purpose ofthese global calculations) the new man-power supply which remains to be drawn from outside industry is now needed to offset this additional industrial wastageand cannot be regarded as available for the Services&apos; intake or for a further netexpansion of essential industry. The number required to make - good thedifference between wastage and intake in industry in the period from 1st april to 31st December, 1943, is estimated at 191,000.8. The following Table shows the man-power supply during that period interms of the net reductions to be made in the various industries and services from which men and women can be withdrawn to meet the demands of the forces and essential industry, and to make good industrial wastageTable V.*Civil Defence ...Certain essential industries and servicesBuilding and civil engineeringLess essential industries and servicesUnoccupiedLess numbers required to replace net industrialwastage      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...Balance available for Forces and essential industry* Part-time women to the equivalent of 175,000 full-time workers; and 15,000 for theServices.&apos;9. The men and women included in this total supply of 414,000 are notequally available for either the Forces or industry. The conditions under which men and women are recruited for the Forces and those governing the supply oflabour to industry are very different. Not only are the administrative processesinvolved in transferring labour to the munitions industries necessarily slowerand more difficult than the call-up for the Forces, but also, in the absence of changes in existing policy which would involve great political difficulties, somemen and women who can be taken for the Forces cannot be directed into industry or transferred to the munitions industries. Moreover, the supply of men for theForces is limited by the availability of fit men of military age. The only largepool of these now available is in the munitions industries, and to get even the global supply of 414,000 it will be necessary to withdraw some men (and women)from munitions, replacing them by women from other sources.Account must be taken of these factors in estimating the supply which canbe made available. The estimate of 414,000 is, in fact, based on providing theForces with the balance of their present authorised intakes, totalling 274,000,in which case it would be possible to provide an expansion of 140,000 workers in munitions and other essential industries. It does not follow that, if the forces were given less than 274,000 men and women, industry could be given a correb-correspondingly greater number. It is, however, the case that the Forces could beprovided with more men and women at the expense of essential industry. Indeed,if the munitions industries were to be allowed actually to decrease, the forces could be provided with even more than the 414,000 which is the global supply for both the Forces and essential industry.10. This estimate of supply assumes that it will be possible before the endof the year to withdraw a further 125,000 workers from building and civil engineering. Recent discussions of the Government building programme suggestthat it may not, after all, be possible to withdraw from building the full numbershitherto assumed. Supply from this source may fall short of present expectations,possibly by about 30,000 to 40,000 men.On the other hand, the supply assumes the withdrawal of a further 240,000from the less essential industries. Under the original plan 500,000 were to be withdrawn from this group by the end of 1943. The measures adopted for thispurpose have resulted in a yield of 361,000 in the first nine months of the period.25,00025,000125,000240,000190,000*605,000191,000414,000
This substantially exceeds the numbers which those measures were expected toproduce in those months; and the Ministry of Labour feel justified in assuming that the policies adopted at the end of 1942 will have the result that by the end of1943 a total of 600,000 (instead of 500,0Q0) will have been withdrawn from this group. In the light of experience during the first half of the period, this may bea somewhat conservative estimate, and slightly larger numbers may in the event be forthcoming from this source to offset any shortfall in the supply from thebuilding industry.&apos; II.11. Globally, therefore, the minimum numbers required before the end cfthe year for the present military and munitions programmes total 912,100 menand women. The available supply, for both the Services and essential. industry,is about 414,000.  In round figures, there is a deficit of half a million.There are no practicable means by which additional man-power, in excessof the present estimate of supply, could be made available before the end of 1943.The War Cabinet must, therefore, determine the broad proportions in which thevarious demands should be cut in order to reduce the aggregate demand to match the available supply. In this connection attention is drawn to the recommenda-tions made in paragraphs 4 and 5 of the Appendix regarding the claims of theessential industries and services other than munitions.12. The problems of man-power supply cannot, however, be finally solved bya purely statistical distribution of the total supplies estimated to be available.This broad review, which is necessarily based on global figures, tends to obscurethe practical difficulties of the problem.(a) First, reference has already been made to the fact that the available supplies of man-power are not completely interchangeable as between the forces and munitions. By no means all the men and women who could be called up forthe Forces could in practice be transferred to munitions.(&amp;) Global figures also fail to bring out the practical difficulties arising fromthe geographical distribution of the demand for, and supply of, labour for the munitions industries. Much of the expansion required is in Regions which arealready congested, particularly the North-West and the Midlands. Thus, about40 per cent, of the total M.A.P. requirement of 212,000 workers are required inthese two Regions; and over another 20 per cent, are required in London andthe South-East, where labour supply is by no means easy. There is littlepossibility of achieving any of the necessary expansion by further recruitmentfrom the population already in these areas, so that any increase must come fromthe transfer of mobile workers (mainly women) from other areas. At present thesupply of mobile women is not adequate to meet these demands. Failing other measures, such as further adjustment of production programmes so as to divertother work from these areas to places where immobile labour is available, it willprobably prove impossible to achieve the necessary expansion, even though thetotal number of workers required might seem statistically to be available.(c) The needs of the munitions industries for mobile women are now greaterthan those of the Women&apos;s Services. Under existing policy, however, as set outin the White Paper (Cmd. 6324) presented to Parliament when the NationalService Acts were extended to women in December 1941, women who have optedfor the Women&apos;s Services may not be directed to employment in industry. Therewould be political difficulties in withdrawing this right to opt for the uniformedServices; and the Minister of Labour has stated that, until it is clear that no more women are required for the Women&apos;s Services, he would be strongly opposedto any alteration of the present policy. It may be thought inexpedient formally to withdraw the right of option until the supply of mobile women exceeds theminimum essential needs of the Women&apos;s Services. Meanwhile, however, it maybe desirable that every practicable step should be taken, by administrative actionsupported by publicity, to reduce the numbers exercising that option and toencourage a larger proportion of the young women called up under the NationalService Acts to undertake employment in the munitions industries.(d) It is clear that the labour requirements of the aircraft programme must,to an increasing extent, be met by transfer of labour from Ministry of Supplywork. Experience has shown, however, that the labour actually released by a programme cut may fall short of estimate, and that not all the labour which isreleased becomes available to meet the needs of other programmes. For example,to take an extreme case, a put in Ministry of Supply programmes which releasedimmobile women working part-time in the North-East would be of little assistance
in meeting M.A.P. requirements in the Midlands. Short of this extreme, thereare various ways in which workers may be lost in the process of transfer, even when this appears to take the most simple and direct form. Thus, for example,in the North-West Region, up to the end of May 1943, Supply Departmentestimates indicated that about 17,800 workers would be made available as a resultof cuts in programmes. In fact, the number of workers who could be identified for release amounted to 11,700; and it is estimated that about 5 per cent, of these,chiefly non-directable women, would be lost to industry.III.13. While our immediate problem is to determine the distribution of man-power up to the end of this year, it is desirable that we should keep in mind theproblems which will confront us in 1944.To prevent the Forces from running down we shall then need, merely toreplace normal wastage and battle casualties at rates calculated on the basis ofrecent experience, a supply of about 275,000 men. To meet this, the only certainsource of supply is the eighteen-year-olds, who will provide about 185,000. these will come very largely from munitions and the essential and less essential industries. We cannot, however, count on any further large supplies from the less essential industries. These will have been cut to the bone; and, as the war drawsnearer to its end and greater emphasis is laid on the problems of providing relief to countries liberated from enemy occupation and putting our industries in abetter position to recover their export markets, it will be even more difficult towithdraw labour from these industries. We must assume that the balance of thedemand for the Forces will have to be met in 1944 by withdrawals from the munitions industries and that at a time when ordinary wastage from those industries will greatly exceed the normal intake.It may be that by then the war will have reached a stage at which we can accept a substantial fall in our munitions production. If this is not the case,however; the withdrawal of fit men of military age from the munitions industries will have to be made good (a) by drawing a larger proportion of our supplies from the United States;and(&amp;) by seeking fresh sources of man-power supply  for  the munitions industries.14. In 1944 there should be a surplus of war production in the UnitedStates; and the shipping shortage should be eased to an extent which will make it possible for us to take fuller advantage of the increased American production.YiTe ought, therefore, to be planning now munitions assignments which will enable us to release from our munitions industries in 1944 the maximum number of fit men of military age.15. Early consideration ought also to be given to the possibility of reducingto the minimum the prospective shrinkage of our industrial labour force.   the increasing wastage is probably due, in the main, to the changed character of thelabour force, and it may be that little can be done to check the increase. If so, it becomes the more necessary to be sure that no means have been left untried ofincreasing the intake from the unoccupied classes.Could not more be done, for example, to bring it home to the unoccupied thatthey are making a valuable contribution to the nation&apos;s war effort if, not havingworked before, they now take any employment? Many of them now believe thatthey are not helping unless they take up work which is clearly &quot; war work.&quot;Many could, however, take work in some less essential industry, particularly retail distribution, and thus set free others who could be directed into munitions.16. Final estimates of requirements and supply of man-power up to the endof 1944 cannot be made until the Ministry of Labour have completed the annualsurvey based on the exchange of unemployment books in July. departments should, however, estimate their requirements for 1944, and should be ready todiscuss provisional plans before the final details of the man-power survey areavailable. It is understood that the Ministry of Labour hope to be able to provideprovisional estimates, in advance of the completion of the detailed survey, so thatthe discussions preliminary to the War Cabinefs annual man-power review could being early in September.J. A.30th June, 1943.
APPENDIX.Essential Industries and Services.WHEN they &quot;reviewed the man-power position at the end of 1942, the WarCabinet made an allowance of 116,000 for the expansion during the eighteen months from the 1st July, 1942, to the 31st December, 1943, of certain of theessential industries and services other than munitions.It is estimated, that these have increased by about 50,000 in the first half ofthat period, leaving a balance of 66,000 on the basis of the original estimate. It isnow expected, however, that during the second half of the period their further expansion will not, in fact, exceed 39,000.2. During the nine months ended the 31st March, however, some of theessential industries and services which were not expected to expand have, in fact,increased by about 130,000. Moreover, it is expected that many of them willcontinue to expand during the second, half of the period. They include suchimportant services as R.A.F. Maintenance Units and R.E.M.E. civilian work-shops.3. The following Table relates to the industries, &amp;c, in which further expansion is necessary. It shows the numbers engaged in each of these industries,&amp;c, at the 30th June, 1942, the net increase in each up to the 31st March, 1943,and the latest estimate of the further expansion likely to take place between the1st April and the 31st December, 1943. The industries, &amp;c, for which specificallowance was made in the 1942 review (see paragraph 1 above),, are indicated by an asterisk.Table VI.Industry or Service.	Number employed 30th June, 1942.

This Table shows that, while there will be little further expansion in theindustries under this heading, there will be further increases in establishments and services controlled by Government Departments.As regards the non-industrial staffs of Government Departments, the figureof 12,500 is the best estimate that can be framed of the net increase during this
period, continued growth in the staffs of the Service and Supply Departmentsbeing offset by some decrease in other Departments. The estimate does not containany margin for the expansion which would result from changes in policyinvolving increased administrative work. ,The greater part of the prospective increase in this group is, however, in theindustrial staffs and miscellaneous women&apos;s services. Hitherto the War cabinet has set no limit to the expansion of these establishments and services. Now thatthe shortage of man-power is acute, it would be unreasonable that any demands on the common pool should be exempt from the cuts which will have to be imposed on the demands of the Forces and the munitions industries.It is therefore recommended that, when the War Cabinet decide how the man-power available up to the end of 1943 should be distributed, they should decide what over-all cut must be imposed on the total requirements of men and womenfor the industries and services listed in Table VI. The total thus allocated to this group should thereafter be distributed between the various establishments and services in the group; and an obligation should then be placed on the department responsible for each to ensure that none absorbs before the end of 1943 man-power in excess of the numbers assigned to it under this allocation.5. This arrangement should suffice to hold the position until the end of theyear. For the purpose of future reviews of man-power, however, it seems desirable that the requirements of these miscellaneous services should be includedso far as practicable in the demands put forward on behalf of the Forces and munitions.Thus, the needs of the Supply Departments (including the Admiralty) for expansion of their industrial staffs and for storage depots and other miscellaneousestablishments should be included in the global estimate of their labour require-ments as a whole. Any unexpected expansion of these miscellaneous services would then fall to be met out of the general allocation made for the purposes ofthat Department.Similarly, the requirements of the War Office and the Air Ministry for civilian labour in depots, civilian workshops, &amp;c, should in future be included aspart of the man-power demands for the Army and the R.A.F. Though these arecivil staffs, it is logical that, for the purposes of a man-power review, they shouldbe included with the Service intake; for, if civilian labour cannot be.obtained,the work would in practice be taken over by Service men and women.For such of these services as do not fall within the control of the Service and supply Departments there should in future be a specific allocation; and a clearobligation should be laid on the responsible Department to see that numbers inexcess of the authorised allocation are not, in fact, absorbed.
