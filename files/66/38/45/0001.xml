MAN-POWER.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.I am circulating again to my colleagues my W.P. (42) 556 of the28th November, 1942 (see W.P. (43) 296), to which this further Note is directly related. Reference should also be made to the Table at Annex II of w.P. (43) 296.2. A satisfactory advance has been made in coping with the TJ-boat peril.It is too early to relax the highest priority accorded to vessels and weapons foruse against the U-boat. Having regard to the increasing part played by the air in anti-U-boat war, the future programme of anti-U-boat vessels not yet begunmust be reviewed and may fall into a lower priority. No construction of merchantship building below 1,106,000 tons or slowing down of repair work can be accepted.The enormous assistance which the Admiralty is receiving from the Air make sit all the more indispensable that they should save labour in every direction even at the cost of some retardation of their programmes, particularly in the construe -tion of men-of-war of the larger categories (battleships and cruisers). It hasbecome imperative that the R. Battleships should be placed in care and main-tenance as material reserves. The fact of their being unmanned should becamouflaged from the enemy, and they should be strategically disposed to the best advantage.2. (a) Upwards of 30,000 men are now maintained or demanded by theAdmiralty for Landing-craft of all kinds and their ancillary organizations.  This25691-1Printed for the War Cabinet.  July 1948. &quot; 16)0k.   mThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited, it is issued for the personal use of .r4&amp;fkt^^r??fo .(S^rf^r^T.t..f &apos; MOST SECRET.

great force is wholly additional to the Navy proper, which has not drawn upon its own resources to any large extent. The personnel of the Landing-craft Fleetcannot be regarded as a permanent addition to our war-time naval burdens. once we have secured effective bridgeheads in Europe, both from the mediterranean and the Atlantic, the ordinary methods of disembarkation will be resumed. TheNavy should therefore look upon this force as a potential reserve against, futurewastage after the weather breaks in 1943. Alternatively, if the Landing-craftFleet is required at a later date for action against Japan, as it probably will be,the Navy by that time relieved of the European War -will be able to find fromits own personnel the necessary complements for remanning the Landing-craftagainst Japan.2. (b) The above does not affect our immediate problem, which is for themoment limited to the end of 1943. It should however be realized that we cannot possibly keep a large Landing-craft Fleet in existence apart from the major operations for which it is designed, and that the bulk of it must be absorbed intothe Navy in lieu of other intakes, and budded out from them again should newtasks arise.2. Between the 1st July, 1942, and the 1st April, 1943, the Navy hasreceived 149,000 men and women. On their old allocation up to the31st December, 1943, they had still due 174,000. They now ask for 43,000 more,making a total of 217,000. I am of opinion that this is altogether excessive and cannot possibly be met. The old allocation cannot be increased, it must even bereduced,&apos;and new services must be met by internal economies and substitutions.3. Para. 3 of W.P. (42) 556 retains its full validity especially in view ofour ever-increasing Air predominance. Further reductions should therefore bemade in Civil Defence and A.D.G.B., and still greater use should be made of theHome Guard for duties with the latter. In the unlikely event, which howevercannot be wholly excluded, of some serious novel attack being brought to bear upon us, emergency measures would have to be taken and the Army would have toassist Civil Defence temporarily.4. Para. 4 holds good in an even stronger form. Our ever-growingsuperiority in the Air should enable the R.A.F. Regiment and Coast Defencesto be further reduced..5. The assumption in the first sentence of para. 5 of W.P. (42) 556 has proved true; It may now be assumed, that, with the exception of the forces in theMediterranean, the British Armies will not be engaged on a large scale with heavy casualties and expenditure of ammunition before the end of April 1944. WhenW.P. (42) 556 was written, the War Office had estimated their wastage bybattle casualties up till the end of June 1943 at 11,000 a month,, and fromordinary causes at 13,000 a month. In fact, the figures are 6,000 a month and,700 a month, showing a saving of 11,300 a month, -Le., 90.000 between November1942 and to-day.   These proved reductions should govern future forecasts.
5. (a) The War Office now demand an increase of 184,000 on their previousallocation, making a total demand up to the end of the year of 247,000. this cannot be met. Plans must be submitted for a reduction of at least 100,000. Atthe same time the drastic pruning of the staffs, also of ancillary units and estab-lishments, and a definite reduction in the establishment of Corps, Army, and lineof communication units, should proceed. The organisation set out in my W.P.(42) 504 should be maintained and, in addition, the establishment of battalionsshould be raised by 72 riflemen. Efficient organisation and good housekeepingshould enable these results to be achieved.6.   Para. 6 retains its full validity and is indeed emphasized.7.   Para. 7 also stands.7. (a) The RAP. had on the 1st April under their old allocation 36,000men and women to come. They ask for an increase of 146,000, making 182,000 inall. Although we are building up the number of Squadrons and expect an increaseof one-sixth by the middle of next year, we are confronted with the fact that this number of men and women cannot be found. The maximum allocation which canbe considered is 100,000 men and women up to the end of the year. By reducingoverheads, the R.A.P. must endeavour to fulfil its programme with no more than this intake of man-power.7. (b) Here however a new salient emerges. A falling off in the plannedsupply of aircraft and consequent grievous contraction of our war effort, is thegreatest shortcoming now threatening us in the sphere of man-power. It can besaid of aircraft more than of any other form of war munitions, that up till the endof the war they will all be certainly used against the enemy or in indispensabletraining. MA.P. is 359,000 short of its old allocation, and it has now demandedonly a reduced total of 212,000, having abated its previous claim by 147,000. Iam of opinion that the reduced figure of 212.000 ought to be accepted. Havingregard however to the slow rate of absorption which has characterized pastmonths, I cannot tell whether the full 212,000 could be worked in by the end of theyear. At the very least the Minister of Labour should do his utmost to satisfyMA.P.&apos;s claims up to 175,000 before the end of the year, M.A.P. to supply a monthly list of factories at which vacancies were to be filled.8.   Para. 8 retains its full validity.9. The allocation suggested to me by the Lord President of the Council as aresult of discussions with the Minister of Labour and National Service and theMinister of Production (see column 9 of Annex II of W.P. (43) 296), contemplatesa deficit of 96,000. There seems very little hope that the supply will be increased.It is a serious thing to budget for so large a deficit which may well in fact be greater. As however it is wasteful to change too sharply departmental schemes,we may accept some deficit as a cushion, provided that any realised deficit istaken from all Services except M.A.P. pro rata to the revised allocation. Tofacilitate this the allocated intake into the Services should be at a uniform rate.
10. I therefore propose that Departments and others concerned should bedirected to conform to the following revised table of allocations between the 1stApril and the 31st December, 1943 : Thousand.160     laNavy......Army......R.A.F..........Admiralty (shipbuilding, &amp;c.)Supply       .........M.A.P..........Other essential industries and servicesSupply14510050-21517570485414rT8f--Deficit       ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...       71 /,11. In future a monthly report should be submitted to the Cabinet showingthe progress made in fulfilling these allocations.12. Once we have dealt with the problems up to December 31, 1943, wemust immediately study the forecast up to June 30, 1944, and so far as possibleto December 31, 1944.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1.Qth July, 1943.
