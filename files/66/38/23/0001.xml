Printed for the War Cabinet.   June 1943.MOST SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (43) 273.26 th June, 1943.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND key it is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document war CABINET.ADDITIONAL   MAN-POWER   REQUIREMENTS   OF   THEROYAL  AIR  FORCE   FOR   1943.Memorandum by&apos; the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Air.(Circulated by permission of the Prime Minister.)THE personnel requirements of the Royal Air Force for 1943 were originallyassessed at a total of 297,000 (W.P. (42) 539). Shortly before this assessmentwas made R.A.F. establishments had been voluntarily reduced, as,a result of an.extensive review in the interests of economy in man-power, to the extent of100,000. The War Cabinet decided,to reduce the allocation which the Secretaryof State for Air proposed by 225,000, with the result that the total intake for theR.A.F. for the current year, subject to review in May 1943, became 72,500.2. In reaching this decision the War Cabinet were influenced by the con-siderations that expansion of R.A.F. personnel might run ahead of the aircraft which were likely to be available, and that it was more important to increase theoutput of aircraft than the number of officers and other ranks in the Royal AirForce.3. A revised expansion programme was subsequently prepared, when theprospects in regard to the production of aircraft were more stabilised. this programme is based on : (a) the Production Programme accepted by the Defence Committee (Supply)and issued by the Ministry of Aircraft.Production in January 1943(as revised up to the 19th March, 1943);(b) the allocations of American aircraft set out in the Arnold-EvillAgreement of the 15th December, 1942, and the provision for subsequent replacement.4. A new British Production Programme has since been issued by theMinistry of Aircraft Production, and negotiations for revised allocations of american aircraft are now in progress in Washington. As a result there maybe certain variations in the numbers of aircraft of different classes which will beavailable to the Royal Air Force; but these variations as a whole are not likelyto have any significant effect on the Expansion Programme and the consequentialrequirements of men and women for the Royal Air Force.5. The additional intake Required for the remainder of the year 1943 to implement this Expansion Programme amounts to 126,000 men and 19,000women. The provision for wastage included in this figure amounts to 41,000 menand 16,000 women, divided as between ground personnel and crews as follows :--(i) Ground personnel ...      ...      ......      ...      48,000(ii) Crews    ..........,      .        ...      ...        9,000(i) is assessed in relation to the strength in ground personnel as a constantbased on experience and reviewed &quot;regularly.   It represents that part of the[25636] /
wastage up to June 1944 for which untrained replacements must be enteredin 1943.(ii) is assessed in relation to expansion and effort in 1944 and early in 1945.It has no relation to the anticipated wastage of crews in 1943 for which it wasnecessary to enter untrained entrants in 1942 and earlier. It represents,therefore, the anticipated wastage (after 1943) for which men must be placed under training in 1943.6. The reductions in Home Establishments, in Balloon Command and in theRA.F. Regiment, amounting in all to 70,000 men and women, to which mySecretary of State referred in his Memorandum W.P. (42) 570, have now been implemented, and full allowance has been made for them in assessing the intakenow proposed.7. These reductions, however, have been more than counter-balanced by increases in establishments necessitated by changes in the organisation of theRoyal Air Force as a whole consequent on the transition from a defensive to an offensive role, and the opening - up of new theatres of war. The number of squadrons to be equipped on a mobile basis for overseas operations has increased,necessitating the creation of self-contained Wing formations, which includeRepair and Salvage Units, and Air Stores Parks, and a large number of miscellaneous ancillary units such as Servicing Commandos, Airfield Head-quarters and Motor Transport Companies. The effect of this has already been reflected in the establishments of formations for the conduct of operations in north Africa, and with the formation of the Tactical Air Force, for cross-Channel operations, many squadrons in the Metropolitan Air Force which havehitherto been supported by static repair and equipment depots will now be reorganised.8. The requirements of the Mediterranean theatre, with extended lines ofcommunication, and of the Tactical Air Force similarly affect the Signalsorganisation, and more personnel are needed for mobile and transportable signalsand R.D.F. Units. Moreover, the progress of invention is constantly increasingthe variety and complexity of Signals equipment, which thus requires a greater number of personnel for its operation and maintenance.9. Aircrew requirements have also increased, owing to the intensification of operations, and to the need for repatriating, on the completion of their firstoperational tour, certain Dominion personnel previously earmarked for service in other Commands.10. The personnel economies which have been achieved in the course of thelast 12 months with the co-operation of Air Officers Commanding-in-Chief havebeen possible only on the assumption that reduced establishments would bemaintained at full strength. Deficiencies are now serious, and operational efficiency is being impaired.11. The additional Royal Air Force personnel requirements for the current year are therefore as follows : Men ...............      126,000Women       ...       ...       ...      ...       ...        19,000145,00012. If additional personnel cannot be provided, the estimated deficiency of trained airmen and airwomen on the 1st January, 1944, after allowing fullprovision for aircrew requirements, will be 16 per cent, of the total establish-ment already seriously reduced for ground personnel. The effect could only be,a reduction in the scale of effort of all types of squadrons. Lower standards ofmaintenance and fewer radio aids available to assist aircraft would result in anincreased wastage and a general lowering of the efficiency and morale of theforce. Moreover, the capacity for further expansion of the heavy bomber forceand the preparation and training of air forces for Continental operations would inevitably be curtailed.EL H. BALFOUR.A ir Ministry, 26th June, 1943.
