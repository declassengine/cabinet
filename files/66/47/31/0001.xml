NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.(1) US. carrier-borne aircraft have inflicted heavy casualties on Japanesewarships and shipping at Truk.1.   H.M.S. Penelope (cruiser) has been sunk by a U-boat off Naples.H.M. submarines have successfully attacked enemy shipping off theNorwegian coast and in the East Indies.German U-boats have been active in the Gulf of Aden and in the indian ocean.Three U-boats have been sunk and two possibly sunk.Northern Waters.2. H.M. S/M Taku, on patrol north of Stavanger, sank a 6,000-ton ship onthe 7th, and possibly torpedoed a 3,000-ton ship on the 12th and another of similarsize on the 13th. --Home Waters.3. H.M. S/M Stubborn, damaged by depth charges off the Norwegian coaston the 14th, has arrived safely at her base.- 4. H.M.S. Warwick (destroyer) was sunk on the 20th off Trevose Head,probably by U-boat.  There were 93 survivors, including the captain.Mediterranean.5. At Anzio, during the week ending the 22nd, 24,300 tons of stores andammunition were unloaded in favourable weather, making a total of 100,000 tonsin four weeks. The port was twice temporarily closed owing to mines. Enemyshellfire on the beaches and shipping, though heavy and accurate on the 16th, wasnot seriously troublesome on other days. There have been many air raids,including one on the 19th with torpedoes and rocket bombs, which was foiled byan efficient smoke screen. Little damage has been caused to shipping, but an ammunition dump was blown up. Five E-boats approached the anchorage on the night of the 20th/21st and several on the 23rd/24th, but were driven off by .S. patrol craft, which sank one E-boat.6. H.M.S. Mauritius bombarded the Formia area on two occasions duringthe week, and H.M. ships Penelope and Dido. and the U.S.S. Philadelphia(cruisers) bombarded in the Anzio area. On the 17th Dido was in collision withan LCI. (L) and was damaged above the water-line. On the following dayPenelope was torpedoed and sunk by U-boat off Naples : there are some 250.survivors.7. On the night of the 19th/20th Allied coastal craft from Bastia attacked a northbound convoy S.E. of Elba; the enemy were last seen firing at each other.In the Adriatic on the following night M.G.Bs. entered Primosten harbour(25 miles west of Split) and shelled the town.8. H.M. S/M Ultor, on patrol off the south coast of France, sank an escort vessel on the 8th and an auxiliary schooner by gunfire on the 15th. Upstart sank a 3,000-ton ship off Toulon.French, Dutch and Italian cruisers have continued to serve as fast transportsin the Mediterranean.East Indies.9. H.M. S/M Stonehenge, on patrol north of Sumatra, sank a 700-ton shipby gunfire on the 5th and a 7,000-ton escorted ship, possibly a warship, on the 12th.Pacific.Marshalls.10. On the 17th a force composed of Marines and elements of a US.infantry division landed on Eniwetok atoll, 330 miles N.W. of Kwajalein. Coverwas provided by warships and by aircraft from carriers&apos;.
The occupation of the northern airfield on Engebi Island and the western halfof Eniwetok Island, containing the other airfield, had been secured by the 20th.By the 21st the whole atoll was in U.S. hands.Carolines.11. On the 17th an attack by carrier-borne aircraft was made on theJapanese Fleet based on Truk, and 19 Japanese ships in the harbour were sunk.This number included two light cruisers, three destroyers, one seaplane carrier,one ammunition carrier, eight cargo ships and one tanker.During this operation the U.S. task force lost 17 aircraft, but 201 enemy aircraft were shot down. One U.S. ship sustained moderate damage. TheJapanese admitted on this occasion the loss of two cruisers, three destroyers and13 transports.New Britain and New Ireland.12. In the S.W. Pacific the Japanese are finding that the cost of main-taining their bases at Rabaul and Kavieng is very high in terms of shipping, and during the week very considerable damage has been done to Japanese shipping of all sorts. One important attack was that made on two north-bound convoys,totalling eight cargo ships and six escort vessels, which were sighted nearMussau Island on the 15th. The next morning 32 escorted U.S. bombers attackedfrom mast-head height, and claimed to have destroyed five ships, including a tanker. Further attacks made on the following day resulted in one more tankerand one more cargo ship being sunk. On this occasion it is claimed that a direct hit was made on a Japanese U-boat.On the 18th Rabaul and Kavieng were each bombarded by five U.S.destroyers. At Rabaul the destroyers attacked under cover of smoke in the early morning and silenced batteries and obtained torpedo hits on ships in the southernwaters of the harbour. At the same time the other five destroyers bombardedKavieng harbour, destroying one tanker and obtaining hits on the jetty.marinas.13. Aircraft from a U.S. task force attacked Saipan and palestinian in theMariana Islands on the 22nd.Solomons.14. M.T.Bs. on the 16th damaged a coaster and five barges in BougainvilleStrait and on the 19th and 20th sank 11 barges and damaged five off New Britain.Anti-Submarine Operations.15. Nineteen attacks have been reported, of which nine were by shore-based aircraft, one by carrier-borne aircraft, one by submarine and the rest by surface craft.In the S.W. Approaches H.M.S. Spey (frigate) sank a U-boat on the 18th,and another on the 19th. Forty-five survivors were picked up. H.M.S. Starling(sloop) on the 19th sank a U-boat in the same area, making the sixth sunk by the2nd Escort Group during their patrol. Many survivors were rescued.H.M.S. Woodpecker (sloop), of this group, was torpedoed on the 20th and takenin tow.Aircraft from the U.S.S. Croaten (escort carrier) possibly sank a U-boatS.W. of the Azores on the 15th, and S.W. of Ireland (R) a Halifax on the,18thattacked a U-boat, which was possibly sunk.16. A report has now been received that while H.M. destroyers Paladin andPetard both attacked the U-boat which sank the s.s. Khedive Ismail on the 12th,in the Indian Ocean, it was a torpedo from Petard which finally sank the U-boat.Enemy Intelligence.17. Photographic reconnaissance on the 19th showed the Koln at.Konigsberg; Hipper at Gdynia; Prinz Eugen and lutzow not at Gdynia, as lastreported. Evidence shows that, with the exception of the Graf Zeppelin andGneisenau, the German heavy ships are all being made ready for service.[26985] ^ b
U-boats.18. There has been increased activity in the Indian Ocean, and little changein the dispositions elsewhere.The U-boat which entered Ferrol on the 10th, and was reported damaged,sailed again on the 19th.Enemy Attack on Shipping.19. U-boats are reported to have attacked six ships, of which two are knownto have sunk.Two U.S. ships in a westbound Mediterranean convoy were torpedoed offPhilippeville. In the Gulf of Aden two laden tankers were sunk, and onetorpedoed, in convoy from the Persian Gulf. One Norwegian tanker was torpedoed S.E. of Seychelles.One ship was damaged, probably by a mine, off Brindisi, but reached port.Several convoys in the S.W. Approaches were shadowed by enemy aircraft from Bordeaux.Protection of Seaborne Trade.20. During the week ending the 13th. 964 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these. 329 were in ocean convoys and 635 in British coastal convoys. Five escort carriers, one anti-aircraft ship, 63 destroyers (including18 U.S. destroyers), and 104 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes, were employedon escort duties.Four homeward-bound convoys, consisting of 160 ships, and six outward-bound convoys, consisting of 169 ships, reached their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying..21. Aircraft have laid mines off Kiel, in the Heligoland Bight, off the frisian Islands, off the north coast of France, and in the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.22.   There have been no reports of minelaying by enemy aircraft.Early on the 23rd, about 15 E-boats, probably minelaying off the East Coast,were driven off by H.M. destroyers; one E-boat was sunk by H.M.S. Garth.During the week 27 ground mines and one moored mine have been destroyed,making the totals 4,682 ground and 4,176 moored.23. In the Mediterranean an acoustic mine was destroyed off Anzio and theport was closed on the 21st following suspected minelaying by aircraft on the two previous nights.   Dangerous areas have been declared off the east coast of Italy.Enemy Merchant Shipping.24. During the period 16th to 31st January, nine enemy ships totalling16,009 tons were sunk and three ships totalling 6,000 tons seriously damaged.This makes a total during January of 21 German or German-controlled ships totalling 74,437 tons sunk or captured, ten of them (24,705 tons) in theMediterranean.25. Two German ships sunk by aircraft off the Norwegian coast in Januaryhave now been identified as the Wittekind (4,029 tons), with a cargo of 6,600 tonsof ore, and the Entrerios (5,179 tons), with 9,000 tons of ore. Both were boundfrom Narvik for Germany.26. The s.s. Brunhiide (1,810 tons) sailed from Istanbul for Constanza onthe 18th.  She had arrived on the 12th from Piraeus.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)   -Northern Sector.27. The Russians have continued to advance towards Pskov from the north-east. South of Lake Ilmen they captured the stronghold of Staraya Russa onthe 18th and are now advancing westwards astride the railway to Dno and Pskov
aOn the 21st they took Kholm and have since made progress west and S.W. ofthe town. Both Staraya Russa and Kholm had been in German hands since August 1941 and had been strongly fortified. It would appear that the Germans,faced by the possibility of losing Pskov, have decided to pull out of the StarayaRussa salient.Central Sector.28. German references to Russian attacks at Vitebsk culminated in theclaim that a second defensive battle in that area had been successfully concludedon the 16th. The Germans stated that from the 2nd-16th February they repulsedattacks by more than 50 rifle divisions and many armoured formations. Thereis no confirmation of these reports from the Russians, and they may be largelyGerman propaganda.Dnieper Bend. . -29. Strong German forces, which probably contained four or five armoured divisions, continued their attempts to relieve the troops encircled west of Smela.They gained a little ground at the expense of heavy casualties, but failed intheir main purpose, and on the 17th, the Russians announced the completedestruction of the ten German divisions which had been surrounded. Germanlosses were later estimated at 55,000 killed and 18,000 prisoners. The Germans,however, claim that some of their forces fought their way out and rejoined themain body.After attacking for some days north and S.E. of Krivoi Rog the Russiansfinally captured the town on the 22nd, and are continuing their offensive N.W.and west of the town.General.30. Although the Russians have not made any extensive territorial gainsduring the week they have had notable successes. Not only have they destroyedat least the bulk of the German forces encircled west of Smela, but they have captured two strongholds in the north, Staraya Russa and Kholm, which theGermans have held for some 2% years, and another in the south, Krivoi Rog,where they have been held up by stubborn German resistance since October oflast year.Italy.31. Operations throughout the week have again been confined to the Cassinosector and the Anzio bridgehead.Elsewhere activities nave been confined, mostly to patrols although the enemy has shown signs of increased activity in the Castelforte area where a counter-attack was repulsed on the 19th at the cost to the Germans of heavy casualties and over 100 prisoners.The Allied attack to reduce the Cassino defences was resumed on the 18thby Indian and New Zealand troops. An advance on the Monastery feature made some ground but was halted by determined counter-attacks and heavy artilleryfire. Similarly to the south, after crossing the River Rapido, Allied troopsoccupied the railway station only to be forced back after holding the objectivefor a day.  Since then our divisions have been regrouping.At Anzio the enemy made his second attempt to pierce our defences with a heavy attack which started on the 17th down the Anzio road. Elements of five divisions were used with armoured support and. the main thrust was deliveredagainst the junction of the leading British and U.S. divisions. After two days&apos;heavy fighting the Allied troops, while preventing a break-through, were forcedback to positions astride the main road some 800 yards north of Cantoniera.Contact between the British and U.S. divisions was. lost, but this was regainedand the situation restored on the 19th by a counter-attack by a U.S. task forceof infantry and tanks. Throughout the following two days the enemy mountedno new attack but brought down heavy artillery fire on to the forward areas.During this period of comparative quiet the Allied positions were improved and the forward troops relieved by fresh units. Further attacks and attempts at infiltration started on the 22nd but on a smaller scale and still directed onthe Cantoniera defences. These made no headway and small groups of the[26985] - b 2
enemy which had penetrated the forward positions are being engaged andbroken up. On the right flank the enemy has made various small attacks all ofwhich have been repulsed without loss of ground.Yugoslavia.32. In Bosnia the Partisans have continued their attacks upon the enemy in the Tuzla-Sarajevo area. Farther west they have recaptured the towns ofBos Grahovo and Cazin (50 miles S.W. and 60 miles west respectively ofBanjaluka).In Slavonia the Germans have taken Koprivnica (45 miles N.E. of Zagreb).      )Elsewhere in Yugoslavia sporadic attacks upon the enemy and his com-munications have been maintained.Greece.33. Negotiations for the conclusion of the civil war started on the 15thbetween E.A.M., E.L.A.S., Zervas and E.K.K.A. representatives under theaBgis of the Senior British Liaison Officer. Very little progress has so far beenmade.Burma.    (An outline map of Burma is included as an inset.)34. Considerable progress has been made by our troops in clearing theNgakyedauk Pass, in which there have been a number of demolitions. It is nowopen up to f-mile of its eastern exit. Further contact has been made with ourdetachments who had established themselves into defensive boxes after theoriginal Japanese outflanking movement. A number of Japanese attacks havebeen made on these boxes, which, however, have held their ground. The mainBawli-Maungdaw road has now been cleared of the enemy and mopping-up inthis area-is in progress. Five miles S.E. of Taung Bazaar our troops attacked and are now mopping-up 200 Japanese who had been withdrawing southwards.Since the beginning of February, Japanese casualties in the Arakan are estimated at 2,500 to 3,000 with a minimum of 850 killed.New Britain.35. Allied patrols from Cape Gloucester have made a further advance ofabout 15 miles eastward along the coastal track. Patrols from Arawe haveregained contact with the enemy east of Arawe airfield.Green Islands (N.W. Solomons).36.   Operations are proceeding satisfactorily, and only a small body of enemy troops remain on the islands.   Their elimination is expected shortly.AIR SITUATION.General Review.37. Bomber Command and the Eighth United States Air Force dropped8,000 tons of bombs, the majority within 36 hours, on targets in Germany. a target at Regensburg was heavily attacked by aircraft of the MediterraneanAllied Air Forces.-   Enemy attacks were made on London on a scale not equalled since 1941.A concentrated effort was made in support of the Anzio beachhead.United Kingdom.38. Four night attacks in appreciable force were made on this country with london as the primary target and a further small raid was made over S.E.England. The attacks which were all carried but with some skill were the heaviest made on London since the night of the 10th/11th May, 1941. Flares were dropped with fair accuracy, and the bombing was completed in a short space oftime, although no great concentration was obtained. An anti-radiolocation devicewas freely used.The first raid on the night of the 18th/19th was carried out by the bulk of theWestern Front &quot;striking force, and 120 enemy aircraft were overland, the majorityof which succeeded in reaching Greater London. In the second attack about60 out of a total of 95 aircraft reported overland reached the Capital and carried
out a. sharp HE. and LB. attack. In the third raid approximately 120 enemy aircraft crossed the coast, but it is not certain how many bombed London, althoughit was the main target. The fourth attack was made by 90 enemy aircraft, 15 ofwhich were estimated to be over the Greater London area.A total of 23 enemy aircraft was destroyed, nine by night fighters, five byA.A. fire, three by unknown causes and six by Intruders over enemy-occupied territory. -Home Waters.39. Escorted Beaufighters (one missing) of Coastal Command attacked a convoy turning into Den Holder; a 2,000-ton ship, two minesweepers and fourR-boats were damaged.  Off Boulogne, two R-boats were damaged by an Albacore.A total of 113 Bomber Command aircraft laid 362 sea-mines in enemy waters;one Wellington is missing.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.40. On the 20th, Fortresses and Liberators of the Eighth U.S. Air Force,supported by 1,125 fighters, flew 952 sorties. On the following day, 859 heavy bombers and 741 fighters were despatched. Industrial targets and airparks atthe following places in Central and North-Western Germany were bombed : Leipzig* (569 tons), Brunswick* (313), Diepholz (263), Tutow (215), Achmer (215)and Gotha (202 tons). An additional 790 tons of bombs were dropped on 19 other objectives, including Rostock.* Casualties inflicted on enemy fighters during these operations were 109 destroyed, 27 probably destroyed and 65 damaged.Thirty-six bombers and nine fighters are missing. -Strong forces of Fortresses and Liberators were again despatched, with fighter support, on the 22nd. The Fortresses, which dropped a total of 220 tonsof bombs at Aschersleben, Bernberg and Halberstadt, encountered fierce opposition from enemy fighters. Liberators released 192 tons on unidentified targets-in central Germany. Thirty-eight Fortresses, three Liberators and 12 of theescorting fighters did not return. Provisional enemy casualties by fighters andbombers are 88 destroyed, 23 probably destroyed and 41 damaged.On the 22nd, the Messerschmitt aircraft factory at Regensburg, Bavaria, was attacked by Fortresses and Liberators of the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces.The return journey was partly covered by fighter escort. Approximately 337 tonsof bombs were dropped through thick cloud; photographs taken subsequentlydisclose considerable damage at Obertraubling airfield. About 120 enemy fighters were encountered; 40 were destroyed and 18 probably destroyed. Our losses were20 bombers and two fighters.Marauders, with Spitfire escort, dropped a total of 146 tons of bombs on airfields at Gilze Rijen, Haamstede and Coxyde. Military objectives in northern france were attacked by 26 escorted Mosquitoes.Night.41. On the night of the 19th/20th, 539 aircraft of Bomber Commanddropped 2,564 tons of bombs in a blind-bombing attack on Leipzig.^&apos; Judged bythe glow reflected on the clouds, well-established fires were achieved over aconsiderable area. Enemy night fighters, four of which were destroyed, were very active.  Of the 598 aircraft despatched, 78 did not return and three crashed.On the night of the 20th/21st, Stuttgart*&apos; was the target for 598 aircraft,539 of which delivered a well-concentrated attack. Approximately 1,990 tons were released in 35 minutes; photographs taken seven hours later showed that many fires had taken hold and. were still out of control. Fighter opposition wascomparatively light. Nine of our bombers are missing and five crashed in thiscountry.Mosquitoes raided five towns in Germany, airfields in Holland and military objectives in Northern France.Italy.42. The main effort of our air forces was concentrated in the area of thebeach-head and the main front of the Fifth Army. A total of nearly 5,000 sortieswas flown in these operations.* Vide Raid Assessment Reports, Appendix VII.
The greatest weight of attack was to the north of the beach-head in the region of Campoleone, Carroceto and Cecchina, these operations being carried out by fighter-bombers and light and medium bombers, and on the 17th also by Fortresses.The targets bombed in close support of our land forces, included enemy troop andM.T. concentrations, tanks, communications and the railway station atCampoleone.In the area south of Rome, heavy attacks were made on enemy communications,troop concentrations and dumps, included in which was a raid by 182 Liberatorsin the region of Frascati and Grottaferrata. At night, roads and other targets were bombed by Wellingtons and Bostons.The enemy effort over the battle area consisted in the main of fighters and fighter-bombers, the number of sorties made daily being between 93 and 170.Allied patrols were flown by Spitfires and war hawks and in combat 49 enemy aircraft were shot down against Allied losses of 34.Railway centres in the Florence area were bombed by Liberators with results which were mostly good; they included Prato, Poggibonsi, Cecina, Pontassieve andSiena. Centres attacked nearer Rome were Orte and Foligno. The docks atImperia (62 miles S.W. of Genoa) were bombed by 24 Marauders and Porto SanStefano (80 miles N.W. of Rome) by 31 Wellingtons.Greece and TEgean.43. North of Heraklion a convoy comprising a ship of 5,000 tons (carrying a large deck cargo) and two destroyers, escorted by 16 aircraft, was attacked byeighteen Beaufighters and four Mitchells; the ship and one destroyer were torpedoed and the other destroyer was left smoking; three enemy aircraft were shot down and three Beaufighters are missing. In the course of other attacks on enemy shipping, nine caiques, six small vessels and a ship of 1,500 tons were sunk or seriously damaged.Yugoslavia.44. The harbours at Sibenik and Zara were bombed by 67 and 38 Liberatorsrespectively. The targets were well covered and several small vessels were probably sunk. Zagreb airfield was also attacked and Kittyhawks carried out a raid on Split and sank a barge at Uljan.Russia.45. The Russian Air Force carried out three large-scale night raids duringthe week. Helsinki was raided on the night of the 16th/17th; accordingto the Finns over 100 aircraft took part and damage was done to buildings andbuilt-up areas by H.E. and incendiary bombs. On the night of the 21st February,the Finnish port of Uleaborg (Oulu) on the Gulf of Bothnia was also attacked.A raid was also made on the important railway junction of Pskov in German-occupied Russia, in which the Russians claim to have done much damage to german supply-trains.Army Air Forces continued their close-support operations over the front asa whole particularly in the Luga area and south and west of Lake Ilmen and,prior to the final reduction of the encircled German forces, in the area of Korsun.There is little doubt that operations generally have been impeded by adverse weather conditions, particularly on the southern part of the front.In North Russia, on the Leningrad front, there is still no sign of effectiveopposition by the G.A.F. to the Russian advance. It is thought that, the G.A.F.is hampered by fighter weakness; this, no doubt, is the main explanation of itsinability to interfere with the severe Russian air attacks on Pskov, which are reported to have inflicted considerable damage, particularly to railways.Burma.46. Between the 16th and 22nd, over 2,000 offensive sorties, including750 by bombers, were flown. Objectives of all types and in nearly every district,were attacked. The major operations included raids, which had excellent results,on Japanese positions at Buthidaung by 74 escorted aircraft and, on two occasions, against similar targets at Maungdaw, in each instance by 24 aircraft with escorting fighters. Liberators dropped 46 tons of bombs on railway targets at Mandalay. An 80-foot steamer and about 50 rivercraft were destroyed andmore than 200 small craft were damaged.
Pacific Zone.New Britain.47. Between the 16th and 20th inclusive, during attacks on Vunakanati andLakunai airfields and shipping at Rabaul [vide &quot;Naval Situation&quot;), allied aircraft destroyed 37 intercepting fighters.New Guinea.48. On the 16th, Kittyhawks and Vengeances bombed and machine-gunnedenemy troops passing over mountain tracks in an attempt to by-pass Saidor. Onthe 18th, Kittyhawks scored six hits on a building in the Madang area, believed to be an enemy H.Q.Caroline I $lands.49. On the 15th, Liberators dropped 50 tons on Ponape. Other attacks are dealt with under &quot; Naval Situation.&quot;Bougainville.50. On the 19th, Mitchells, in a low-level attack, sank a 2,000-ton freighter,three smaller ships, three escort vessels and two sea-trucks. On the 20th, naval aircraft bombed buildings, bridges and bivouac areas, and other aircraft destroyed20 barges at Matchin Bay.Sevang.51.   On the night of the 19th/-20th, 18 Liberators bombed Laha airfield.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.52. Attacks were made on this country on five nights during the period under review. On four of these nights (18th/19th, 20th/21st, 22nd/23rd and23rd/24th) London was the chief target and the attacks were made in appreciableforce the heaviest on London since the lOth/llth May, 1941 on the fifth night(21st/22nd), operations were oil a small scale and almost wholly confined to partsof Southern and South-Eastern England.In the first two attacks on London most of the bombing was concentrated intoa period of about half an hour, and in both the latter into not more the fiftyminutes. In the first two there were over 500 and 650 fires respectively, in thethird some 270 and in the fourth the fire situation was never really serious. Inall four attacks many boroughs were affected, and it cannot be said that a particu-larly heavy concentration was made in any one area, although in the second attackFulham, Putney and Chiswick received a good deal of attention, as didHammersmith, Camber well and Feltham in the third and again Fulham in thefourth.The number of key points affected in the various attacks were 20, 26, 13and 7 respectively, including the following relatively serious incidents whereproduction was in each case suspended : On 20/21st, the Latimer Engineering Company, S.W., office and storeswrecked; Marconi W/T Company, Parson&apos;s Green, Fulham, premises gutted;Brand and Fitch, Ltd., Clerkenwell, severe damage by fire; Integral AuxiliaryEquipment, Ltd., The Vale, Acton, top floor gutted; Omes, Ltd., Willow Vale,Barnes, serious fire, bottom floor flooded.On the 22nd/23rd, Victoria Docks and Ranks Flour Mills, damaged by fire.On the 23rd/24th, Shell Mex and B.P. Company, Ltd., Fulham,, damage by fire; F. Burnerd and Company, Ltd., Ethelburga Street, S.W., factory badly damaged.The number of fatal civilian casualties in London so far reported for the fournights concerned totalled 180, 216, 29 and. 93.In the rest of the country damage and casualties were slight except on the night of the 22nd/23rd, when there were large fires in Queen Street and at . Botolph&apos;s railway station, Colchester, and damage at Egham and Weybridge.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Berlin. Photographs taken at various times since the 21st December togetherafford almost complete cover of the city and of damage caused in the last nineheavy attacks. Prints are mainly of good quality and scale but, in places, snowhas rendered detailed assessment difficult. An immediate interpretation shows the&quot; largest concentrations of damage, mainly due to fire, to be in the districts ofTiergarten, Mitte and Schoneberg, with other concentrations and incidents inWilmersdorf, Tempelhof, Johannisthal, Spandau, Kopenick, Treptow andLiebtenburg. Industrial damage includes the following items, many of whichhave previously been reported by ground sources : 	District.	Priority.Severely damaged  A.E.G.

(Neupetritor),which produces airframe components for Me. 110 and is a priority 2 target.Smoke makes assessment of damage impossible, but the main factory building and workshops and machine shops are seen to be on fire.Leipzig. Photographs taken on the 20th February do not cover the westernoutskirts of the town and snow and smoke render interpretation difficult. Itcan be seen, however, that as a result of the R.A.F. attack on 19/20 February,residential and commercial damage has been caused throughout the south of thecity, that a number of bombs have fallen close to the World Fair buildings(already severely damaged in the attack of 3rd/4th December) and KirchestrasseStation, and that the Paunsdorf railway workshops have been hit.The U.S.A.A.F. attack in daylight on the 20th February caused heavy damage to the three aircraft assembly factories at Mockau as follows  (i) Erla Maschinenwerk G.m.b.H., Me. 109 Assembly.   Priority 1.   Twoassembly shops severely damaged and two flight hangars damaged.(ii) Allgemeine  Transport   Anlagen   G.m.b.F .,   Junkers   88   Assembly.Priority 1. The three main assembly shops damaged, two of thembeing still on fire at the time of photography.(iii) Junkers Flugzeug Motorenwerke A.G., Junkers 88 Repairs.  Priority 2.Component and assembly shops badly damaged, and offices and work-shops partly gutted.   Fires still burning.In each of the above cases there is a heavy concentration of craters in thefactory area.
In addition, dense smoke is billowing from the Erla Maschinenwerk G.m.b.H.at Heiterblick Me. 109 components. Priority 1 while the Abtnaundorf works of the same concern, which are also engaged on Me. 109 components (Priority 2),appear to be damaged, but this factory too is partly obscured by smoke.Magdeburg. A covering of half-melted snow makes interpretation of photo-graphs taken after the attack on the 21st/22nd February very difficult, but it canbe seen that the most concentrated damage is in the south of the city. The follow-ing industrial concerns have been affected, the first two severely : - Priority.Maschinenfabrik Buckau (Salbke) P. Wolf A.G.....      ... 1Railway workshops ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 2Krupp Grusonwerk A.G. (Heavy engineering, &amp;c.)      ...      ... 1 +Maschinenfabrik Buckau ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 1In addition, a large hutted camp at Rothensee has been more than half destroyed.Stuttgart. On photographs taken after the attack on the 20th/21st February,heavy smoke obscured the central, south and south-west town areas and rendersinterpretation impossible. At Feuerbach, Bad Cannstadt and in the nearby suburbsin the north and north-east many fires are seen to be burning and damage due with.E. is heavy. The works of Robert Bosch A.G., Feuerbach (sparking-plugs,magnetos, &amp;c), has been very seriously damaged; the main foundries and the newsparking-plug factory are burning, and workshops, machine shops and stores havebeen severely damaged.Other items of industrial damage which can be seen include two importantmetal works and the railway repair shops at Bad Cannstadt.Rostock. An immediate interpretation of photographs taken after theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 20th February shows damage to several importanttargets in the town and immediate vicinity. In the Neptun Werft shipyard,which is building U-boats and M.T.Bs. and is a Priority 1 target, two largeshops have been severely damaged, a medium-sized building half-destroyed, andother buildings have received minor damage. There is a direct hit on Slip No. 2and the s.s. Schwerin (Train and Car Ferry) moored near Floating Dock No. 1is listing to starboard and down by the stern.The main building of the components factory of Ernst Heinkel Flugzeug-werke G.m.b.H. priority 2 immediately S.W. of the shipyard, has been almostone-third destroyed.At Marienhe the Heinkei assembly factory, a Priority 1 target assemblingHe. Ill, has had one pressing shop gutted and two more damaged, a group of four boiler houses partially destroyed and the experimental work building about two-thirds gutted; a small building has also been gutted. There is scatteredbusiness and residential damage south of the Neptun Werft, and a large gas-holder has been severely damaged.Bulgaria.Sofia. ^Photographs which cover the six raids between the 14th november and the 10th/11th January, show that damage is widespread, with the heaviestconcentration in the city centre, where business and residential premises have suffered severely. In this area, the Town Hall and adjoining buildings, the PoliceHeadquarters and the National Theatre have all been damaged. In theindustrial quarter, a number of factories have been destroyed and/or damaged,while, in the Prince Boris Garden, four sports stadiums have been affected. the infantry Barracks, the Engineers Barracks, the Artillery Barracks, the MilitarySchool and the School of Telegraphy have all been damaged.
