THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 117.2l6*  February, 1944.RECOVERY OF RAILWAY FARES BY PEERS ATTENDING sittings of THE HOUSE OF LORDS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.Lord Addison has raised with me the very real difficulties which theexpense of railway travel places in the way of many peers who desire to performtheir Parliamentary duties. I had from time to time previously receivedintimations from several Scottish peers that they were finding the cost of travel to and from London from their homes in Scotland a very serious burden, and a real bar to their being able to attend the House. I myself felt considerablesympathy with these representations, and having ascertained from the Chancellorof the Exchequer that he was not unfavourably disposed to the provision of some measure of relief, I called a meeting of the Leaders and Whips of the three-Parties, with the assistance of the Lord Chancellor and the Clerk of the parliaments, to obtain their views before proceeding any further.Sir Henry Badeley&apos;s note, which follows in the succeeding paragraph, gives avery succinct account of the outcome of our considerations.2. &apos;&apos; At a meeting of the Leaders of the three Parties in the House, the LordChancellor, the Whips of the three Parties and the Clerk of the Parliaments ascheme for the recovery of payments by peers for Railway fares to and from theirresidences and the House of Lords was approved.  The scheme is as follows : (1) Application forms for the recovery of payments made in respect ofrailway journeys for attendance on business at the House of Lordswill be obtained from the Accountants Department, Office of the clerk of the Parliaments, House of Lords, S.W. 1.(2) Such forms will only be available for journeys made between the residenceof the peer and London (i) they will not be available for journeys within the metropolitan area;(ii) they will apply only to peers making the journey and the ticketsissued will not be transferable.3. At the end of each month a peer who desires to claim repayment of themoney spent on railway tickets will be requested to forward the form with thedetails completed to the Assistant Accountant, Parliament Office, House of Lords,S.W. 1, who will send a warrant on the Paymaster-General&apos;s Office/a cheque, thereceipt of which should be acknowledged.It was suggested that the Leader of the House should take the matter beforethe Cabinet, and if Cabinet approval was obtained that questions should be asked :(a) in the House of Commons, to give the Chancellor of the Exchequer an oppor-tunity of expressing the views of the Government; (6) in the House of Lords, togive that House an opportunity of expressing their opinion.&quot;4. I would ask my colleagues for their approval (1) of the principle of thisrelief, and if approval is given, (2) of this matter now being raised in Parliament.C.House of Lords, S.W. 1,21st February, 1944.Copy No. ^ 5/WAR CABINET.[26975]
