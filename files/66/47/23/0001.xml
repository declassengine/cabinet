THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET. I Copy No.W.P. (44) 123.18th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION.Report by the Lord President of the Council.AT the meeting of the War Cabinet held on the 8th July * I was invited,together with the Lord Privy Seal (then Lord Cranborne) and the Attorney-General, to hold an immediate enquiry into certain recent cases of premature disclosure in the press of matters under discussion, or about to be discussed, bythe War Cabinet.The cases (in the order in which we propose to deal with them) relate todisclosures as to -  (1) War pensions.(2) Educational reform.(3) The decision of the Committee on the Reduction of National GovernmentStaffs as to the reduction of the Ministry of Labour staff.(4) Demobilisation.1. Pensions.Articles appeared in the Daily Herald on the 7th and 13th July purporting to forecast the pensions changes which the Government would make.A number of proposals as to pensions changes had been made by the british legion, and in the course of debates in the House of Commons on the PensionsTribunal Bill (held on the 24th June and the 1st July) there had been a gooddeal of discussion on this subject. When the first article was written it was known that, the Government were considering changes and it was obvious thatcertain concessions would be made.We have made careful enquiries as to whether there might have been aleakage. We have seen the Minister of Pensions and are satisfied that he tookvery special and proper steps to prevent any leakage from his office.We do not think that there is anything in the articles which an intelligentjournalist, without inside information, might not well have anticipated.2. Education.A statement appeared in the &apos;&apos; London Letter &apos;&apos; of the Western Mail andSouth Wales News, of the 6th July, to the effect that Mr. Butler was ready withthe White Paper on educational reform and giving an accurate and compre-hensive statement of the proposals which it contained. A further statement in the &quot; London Letter &quot; of the same paper appeared on the following day, butthis only elaborated and commented on the information previously ^revealed.Articles appeared in the Daily Mail, Daily Express and Daily Herald on the8tih Julv, but these were obviously based on the information revealed in theWestern Mail of the 6th July.We have seen Mr. Butler and compared the articles carefully with the white paper. .As Mr. Butler told us, there had been discussions over the last two years with the Churches and Education Authorities and no doubt other representative bodies.It is inevitable that, after discussions of this kind, some idea can be gatheredof the proposals likely to be accepted by the Government.* W.M. (43) 95th Conclusions, Minute 3.[26959]
2On the other hand, in this case we think there is evidence that Mr. James(the London Editor of the Western Mail, who had written the offending article)had some inside information. Indeed, he himself said, on being approached by the press officer of the Board of Education, that he had got the information from &quot; someone not very far from Westminster &quot; and boasted of his scoop.We think it unlikely that he had an actual copy of the White Paper; we thinkit more probable that he was told that the White Paper was ready and was given some information as to specific proposals in it.We have obtained information as to the number of those who would or mighthave seen the White Paper or been familiar with the proposals which it contains.The task of conducting an enquiry to discover who might have been responsiblefor the leakage would be very formidable indeed and might well produce no result.We do not think in those circumstances that the labour involved in such an enquiry would be justified, in view of the unlikelihood of getting any definiteresult.3. Reduction of Ministry of Labour Staff.In the Evening Netvs of the 7th July there appeared a statement by their political correspondent to the effect that Mr. Herbert Morrison, as Chairman ofthe Cabinet Committee appointed to effect staff cuts in Government Departments,had directed Mr. Bevin, Minister of Labour, to reduce his staff by 7-5 per cent.,with the result that the Ministry of Labour staff throughout the country wouldhave to be reduced by about 3,300, bringing down the number to 40,000.This correctly recorded the decision of the Morrison Committee, which washeld on the 13th May, as to the reduction in the Ministry of Labour staff.We find that there had been.a very wide circulation of this information.On the 24th June, 1943, a letter was addressed by the Ministry of Labour toall heads of departments and other headquarters&apos; officers down to and includingthe rank of staff clerk (or equivalent rank) and to Regional Controllers. Thatletter referred to the Morrison Committee and set out the number (3,300) of theproposed reduction in the Ministry of Labour staff. It did not refer to the per-centage given in the Evening News article.On the 10th June, 1943, the Morrison Committee&apos;s decision and the fact thatit had been given by the Morrison Committee was made known to a meeting ofthe Emergency Joint Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Labour Depart-mental Whitley Council. It is clear from the minutes of that meeting that notonly the number (3,300) but the percentage (7-5) of the cut was given. We under -stand that nothing was said at the meeting about the information given beingconfidential, though it would not, in the ordinary course, be proper to publish any information until the minutes had been circulated.The minutes were circulated on the 5th July and we understand that theywere available for publication as from the morning of the 7th July, the date onwhich the Evening News article appeared.We do not think that there is any ground for saying that there was animproper use of information in this instance. But, in view of the strict ruleagainst disclosing membership of Cabinet Committees, it is obvious that a mistakewas made in mentioning at the meeting that the Committee was presided over bythe Home Secretary and in circulating that information to grades who were not concerned.4. Demobilisation.In the r)any Mail of the 3rd July there appeared an article by the industrialCorrespondent on demobilisation. The article stated in the opening paragraphthat demobilisation was to be tackled anew by a Committee under mr. McCorquodale, Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour.We are&apos; told that no official or unofficial statement had been made that this procedure was under consideration; the suggestion had first appeared inparagraph 5 of the Minister of Labour&apos;s Memorandum on the two-stage ending of the war (W.P. (43) 284).With regard to the rest of the article, a good deal of it consists of suggestions and proposals which might have occurred to any intelligent student of the subject.A good deal of it is accurate, and, if the writer had had inside information aboutthe Committee, he might well have supplemented it by other information as towhat was being done on this subject, since the article mentions points which hadbeen dealt with in the papers by other Ministers on the two-stage ending of thewar (e.g., the question of extra pay to men who remain in the forces, the question
as to whether the armies necessary for the policing of Europe and fighting japan should be made up of volunteers, the question of reinstatement in former employ-ment and the control of engagement of labour).In view of these indications of a leakage, we thought that it would be useful to circularise the Departments who had received the Cabinet Papers concerned.These papers were : 1. W.P. (43) 284.   Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService for the War Cabinet on the two-stage ending of the war anddemobilisation, military and civil.2. W.P. (43) 232.   Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India for theWar Cabinet on morale and the war against Japan.3. W.P. (43) 252.   Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air for theWar Cabinet on morale and the war against Japan.4. L.P. (43) 143.  Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and NationalService for the Lord Presidents Committee on questions relating to post-war employment.The Chairman therefore wrote to the Minister in charge of each department concerned asking the Minister 1(1) to let him know what officers in his Department saw the copies of theabove-mentioned documents which were received in the Department;(2) to make enquiries as to whether any of those who had seen the documentshad discussed them with any outside person; and(3) to check up to see if all the copies of the documents which were received in the Department were still in the possession of those to whom theywere issued.The answers to these enquiries have not revealed any leakage. The officers who saw the documents have given assurances that they have not discussed themwith any outside persons and the copies are all in their appointed places.In the circumstances, we do not feel that we can usefully carry our investiga-tions on this leakage any further.General.From time to time minutes and circular letters have been sent to ministers from No. 10 Downing Street, enjoining on them to restrict very closely the numberof their advisers to whom Cabinet papers are shown.The most important of these was issued by the Prime Minister on the14th April, 1942, and contained the following : &quot; In particular, I ask my colleagues to see that the following precautionsare strictly observed : First, it is incumbent on them to ensure that papers of the War cabinet and of Ministerial Committees should not be seen by any save their immediate advisers concerned in the formulation of policy.&quot;It is, of course, clear that discretion on this matter must remain with individual Ministers, save in the very limited class of papers which are issuedby the Prime Minister on the understanding that they, are for the eyes ofMinisters only. It is also evident that differences in organisation in Depart-ments, or in the extent to which Departments are affected by particular questions,must be reflected in the number of officers to whom particular papers have to be shown.Nevertheless, after taking all these circumstances into account, we areimpressed by the very wide variation in the number of officers in Departmentswho saw particular papers. As might be expected it was in the Service Depart-ments that these papers were seen by largest numbers of officers. The fact,however, that a particular Cabinet paper was seen by between 50 and 60 officersin a single Department shows, in our view, the need for a tightening up ofthe present procedure.We suggest that the Prime Minister should consider the issue of a furtherinstruction to Ministers on the following lines : (1) Ministers are reminded that, while it is within their discretion to decide which of their advisers or subordinates should be shown cabinet papers, the normal rule is that such papers should not be seen by anysave their immediate advisers concerned in the formulation of policy.
(2) Ministers are expected to exercise a real measure of control in thismatter, and must satisfy themselves from time to time that their instructions are being carried out.&quot;(3) If occasions arise on which it is necessary that any considerable numberof officers should be consulted in particular issues arising out ofCabinet papers, this should be done by means of minutes addressedto the officers concerned, confined to the particular points on whichthey are required to advise, thus avoiding a wide circulation of memoranda setting out the views of particular Ministers on mattersof policy which are under discussion in the Cabinet or in a ministerial committee.In dealing with leakages of this kind, it must be remembered that it is thebusiness of newspaper men to get news and that they are highly skilled at puttingtwo and two together, and it is therefore extremely difficult to prevent theseleakages altogether. But we think that an instruction on the lines suggested above would go some way towards diminishing the risk of such leakages.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,18th February, 1944.
