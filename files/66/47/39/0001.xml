Results January operations: 2 E/Adestroyed, 3 coastal vessels destroyed out of total 18 attacked, 67 tonssupplies and 5 personnel dropped in enemy territory, 28 wounded evacuated from Yugoslavia. 463 hours flown on escort and A/S activities. Service-ability improvement expected during February, as fighter, -bomber andseaplane MUs are just getting into stride and salvage material becoming-      available to alleviate scarcity of spares.(c) Total 7,700 skilled and unskilled personnel committed to R.A.F. andU.S.A.A.F., of which 2,070 allocated and 836 immediately available. Expectfurther 1,120 ready by end of February.-: ANNEX II. .....-Telegram from Air Marshal Slessor dated 21st February, 1944.Following are additional details of I.A.F activities. Immediately after theconclusion of the armistice Italian Air Force activity was confined to defensivefighter patrols over Taranto and Brindisi. As further aircraft were collectedtogether and organised these activities were extended and shortly afterwardsbomber transport aircraft were proving most useful for conveying R.A.F. personnel and equipment and stores from Sicily to the Italian mainland and thisundoubtedly enabled our units to operate much more quickly than would otherwise have been the case. Then followed the battle for Corfu, when Italian fighters tried to provide some protection to their ground forces attempting to hold the island.
During this operation the I.A.F. scored their first successes against the G.A.F., andalso suffered their first losses at German hands. Early October saw the I.A.F.starting to play its part in the protection of our convoys and also the first rescue ofAllied crews by Italian air-sea rescue aircraft. When the Venzibo (?) Divisionfailed to escape from the Balkans the bomber transports were used to carrysupplies to this area and from this time their activities were gradually extendedto include the S.O.E. supply-dropping activities they are now undertaking.2. During the period from 14th September to 18th February the Italian AirForce has made over 2,200 sorties. The division of this work can be outlined asfollows :  (a) Fighters. These have been employed primarily on escort of bomber and bomber transport aircraft, but, in addition;, have made a number of offensivesweeps. Ground attack missions and attacks on enemy airfield and radarstations. Approximately 840 operational sorties have been flown and 18enemy aircraft are claimed to have been destroyed in the air, 11 destroyed onthe ground and 19 damaged.(b) Coastal and Air-Sea Rescue Aircraft.-Anti-submarine sweepsconvoy escort and air-sea rescue missions have steadily increased and. theI.A.F. are now averaging 400 hours per month on coastal operations and arereleasing a corresponding Allied effort for employment elsewhere. SeveralAllied airmen have been rescued by Italian air-sea rescue aircraft which are well fitted for this work. Attacks on shipping in the Adriatic have assisted in the reduction of German coastal traffic and to date 11 barges and small craft are claimed as destroyed and 32 damaged.(c) Bombers and Bomber Transport. 121 tons of supplies have been dropped in the Balkans, in all over 850 transport missions of all typeshave been flown. A proportion of the Balkan supply operations have beendone by day with fighter escort and, on some of the missions when transportshave landed, they have brought out seriously wounded. So far 46 have beentransported back to Italy in this way. On the present planning we areanticipating a monthly effort of 100 sorties of which at least 50 per cent,should be successful. In addition, the transport aircraft which are not suitable for supply dropping have done and are doing most useful work ina normal transport role.(d) Ground Personnel other than those employed on duties outlined above. Large numbers of I.A.F. tradesmen are employed in R.A.F.maintenance and repair organisations. The programme for the formationfrom surplus I.A.F. personnel of specialist aeronautical tradesmen companies and guard companies for use by the Allies involves 12,000 men. this represents a very large contribution to the Allied cause and is particularly important in view of the present shortage of Allied man-power.3. There is no doubt that the small amount of Allied assistance given has paid very valuable dividends.
