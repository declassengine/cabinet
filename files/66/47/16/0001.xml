This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s government secret .P. (44) 11618th February, 1944Copy No.    35WAR CABINETARMY BENEVOLENT FUNDMEMORANDUM  BY THE  SECRETARY  OF STATE  FOR WARI. At the request of the Prime Minister I circulate, for the information of mycolleagues, the outline of a scheme which has been worked out by the Army Council,with advice from the Charity Commissioners, for the formation of an Army BenevolentFund. The object of the Fund is to facilitate the provision and administration ofcharitable assistance for the soldier and his dependants. The new Fund will not in anyway compete with existing Service charities that help Army personnel, past and present,and their dependants.2. It will be noticed that it is not proposed that the Fund should deal withindividuals in the administration of individual relief as does the R.A.F. BenevolentFund. Instead, it will deal in block grants to existing charities, and endeavour to co-ordinate their activities. This is the practice followed by the leading Naval charity(King George&apos;s Fund for Sailors) whose objects are principally:  (a) to secure more efficient aid and support for approved Marine BenevolentInstitutions and to obtain from the public subscriptions, donations, bequests,etc.;(6) to apply any moneys so obtained to making grants to Institutions and tocreating a capital fund;(c) to inspect individual Institutions making applications for aid;(d) to require all Institutions making applications for grants to keep their accounts and statistics in a uniform way.3. Before the formation of the Army Benevolent Fund is announced, I should likemy colleagues to be aware of the scheme.P. J. G.The War Office, .18th February, 1944.Printed for the War Cabinet, February, 1944
annex . Existing charitable funds for the Array fall into three categories: -(a) Those administered by the War Office and generally known as &quot; Central- Funds &quot;.(b) Regimental and Corps Associations and Funds.  They are for the members and ex-members of individual Corps and Regiments and are entirely independent of the War Office.(c) Independent charities.   The larger organizations, such as the Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos;and Airmen&apos;s Families Association, and the Incorporated Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos;and Airmen&apos;s Help Society, cater for all three Services.But there is at present no central charitable organization which covers the whole ofthe above field, so far as the Army is concerned. It has recently become evident thatthe absence of such an organization is a serious disadvantage to the Army in comparisonwith the other two Services. It is understood, for example, that in connection with the&quot; Wings for Victory &quot; campaign alone, the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund benefitedto a very considerable extent. The fact that Army charities are not organized on a nation-wide basis has meant that they have not been able to take advantage of similaropportunities. Appeals on behalf of individual regiments are necessarily limited to those interested in that regiment. Moreover regiments and corps such as the Royal artillery and Royal Engineers are not connected with any particular locality to which they canlook for subscriptions.2. In order to overcome these limitations of the present system it is desired to setup an Army Benevolent Fund with the following objects:  (a) To secure more efficient aid and financial support for approved military charitieswhich directly or indirectly benefit the persons (male or female) ordependants of persons who are serving or have served in H.M. Army.- (Note. These &quot;military charities&quot; will include Regimental Associations and, also charities such as the Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Families Associa-tion, the Incorporated Soldiers&apos;, Sailors&apos; and Airmen&apos;s Help Society, theOfficers&apos; Association and the Officers&apos; Families Fund.)(b) To obtain by public appeals or otherwise, subscriptions, donations, bequestsor gifts of money or property.(c) To create a capital fund.(Note. Unlike the R.A.F. Benevolent Fund it is not proposed that theArmy Fund should deal with individuals in the administration of relief.1      The reasons for this are-(i) that it would need elaborate machinery which would duplicate that already in existence in Voluntary and Regimental Associations, and(ii) that there would be danger of relief being duplicated from two sources.The fund would therefore deal in block grants to existing charities, but would do what it could to co-ordinate their activities.)3. The Fund will be administered by a Control Board which will consist of aPresident, three ex-officio members (the Adjutant-General, one of the Permanent Under-Secretaries of State and the Chaplain-General), fourteen nominated members (appointedby the Army Council and representative generally of the Corps and Regimental interestsof the Army), three nominated members (representatives of Voluntary Associationsapproved by the Army Council and nominated by the Associations) and ten co-opted,members (elected by the Board themselves without restriction).Members will be appointed for three years and there is power to re-elect for afurther period.4. The.Board may also invite distinguished persons to become patrons and vice-patrons of the Fund.(b43/181)   120   2/44   W.O.P.   16796
