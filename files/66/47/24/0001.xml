THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 124.lSth February, 1944WAR CABINET.APPLICATION   OF   ALLIED   POWERS   (MARITIME   COURTS)ACT,  1941,  TO FRANCE.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AT their meeting on the 18th February, 1944, the Lord presidents committee considered a proposal to make an Order-in-Council authorising theestablishment of a French Maritime Court in this country. Such an order wouldbe made under Section 1 (2) of the Allied Powers (Maritime Courts) Act, 1941,under the terms of which His Majesty may, by Order-in-Council, direct that theAct shall apply to any Power allied, with His Majesty or to any Power for thetime being at war with any Power with which his Majesty is for the time being at war.The reasons for this proposal, together with the views of the interested departments, are set out in a joint memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, the Secretary of State for the Home Department and theMinister of War Transport, which was before the Lord Presidents Committee(L.P. (44) 32).2. The Lord Presidents Committee are satisfied that, for the reasons setout in paragraph 2A of L.P. (44) 32, the establishment of a French MaritimeCourt in this country is required in order to ensure the fullest use being madein the interests of the war effort of French and ex-French ships, and of the servicesof French seamen. But the proposal gives rise to certain questions of principle which, in the opinion of the Committee, should receive the consideration of theWar Cabinet before it is finally approved.3. The first question concerns the liabilities which the Secretary of State forthe Home Department would, assume if the proposed Order-in-Council were made.The French Committee of National Liberation have no facilities in this countryfor effecting the arrest of French seamen or for inflicting any penalties whichmight be imposed upon, them by a French Maritime Court. The effect of makingthe Order would, therefore, be not only to give the French Committee criminal jurisdiction in this country over a limited class of French civilians, but also to involve the Secretary of State for the Home Department in responsibility forarresting French seamen who committed offences and for inflicting upon thempenalties imposed by the French Maritime Court.The Secretary of State for the Home Department has, of course, alreadyassumed similar liabilities in the case of the merchant seamen of other Powersto whom the Act has been applied. In the unlikely event of a successful applica-tion- for a writ of Habeas Corpus being made by a merchant seaman, either ofFrance or of any of the other countries concerned, who was detained under theAct, the position would, have to be met by a Bill of Indemnity. It is, however,possible to argue that a*n application for a writ of Habeas Corpus by a Frenchseaman might be more likely to succeed, because it might be held that the status of the French Committee of National Liberation was such that the Act could not properly be applied to it.4. This leads to the question of the position of the French Committee ofNational Liberation itself. Last summer the Solicitor1-General expressed theopinion that the functions and status of the Committee made it possible to regard[26958]Copy No.
it as a Government of an Allied Power (France) within the meaning of therelative Sections of the Allied Forces Act, 1940, the Allied Powers (War Service)Act, 1942, and the Allied Powers (Maritime Courts) Act, 1941, without extendingby conduct the degree of recognition afforded to the Committee by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. Orders-in-council were subsequently made under Section 1 (1) ofthe Allied Forces Act securing the jurisdiction of the Committee over french forces in this country and the Colonies, and the French Delegation were informedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government were, in principle, prepared to apply the AlliedPowers (War Service) Act to Frenchmen in this country.5. The present proposal is also based on. this opinion of the Solicitor-General;and the Foreign Office are satisfied that the establishment of a French MaritimeCourt in this country would not amount to an innovation or in any way extend the degree of recognition already granted to the Committee. The Lord presidents committee recognise, however, that, in present circumstances, it is necessary toproceed with great caution in any matter involving the position of the french committee of National Liberation, and accordingly consider that the point is oneto which they should draw the attention of the War Cabinet.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,18th February, 1944.
