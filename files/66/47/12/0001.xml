(44) 112.17th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.ALTJMINIZED EXPLOSIVES.Note by the Prime Minister.AT the end of September 1943, during discussions about the German long-range rocket, doubts were expressed about the efficiency of our high explosives ascompared with those of the Germans. The Paymaster-General immediatelydiscussed the matter with the Chief of the Air Staff and the latter proposed to theChiefs of Staff Committee, who supported his proposals strongly, (a) that urgent action should be taken to establish the true facts, and(b) that if a substantial inferiority was revealed, the competent authoritiesshould be called upon to give an explanation and a proposed remedy.2. At the suggestion of the Chiefs of Staff Committee the Paymaster-General undertook the enquiry suggested at (a), and on the 6th October submitted a report to the Chiefs of Staff Committee which clearly established that ourexplosives were inferior to the Germans&apos; and that an improvement estimated by various authorities of between 40 per cent, and 100 per cent, could be made ifaluminized explosives were used instead of the existing types. Lord Cherwellrecommended that the most urgent possible preparations to change over should bemade without waiting for the result of further trials. With this recommendation the Chiefs of Staff Committee and I agreed, and immediate action was taken to effect the change over.3. I also appointed a Committee consisting of Sir Walter Monckton(Chairman), Sir Alan Barlow and Sir Robert Robertson &quot; to consider the report
on the efficiency of our blast bombs, to examine the course of our experimentaland development work on this subject ^during .the ^present war and to report whether, and if so why, there has been any failure to prosecute research to a successful conclusion or to apply the results of that research in practice.55Briefly, an unfortunate experiment in 1941 gave a misleading result, chieflyowing to the unsatisfactory methods of measuring blast pressures in use at thattime. In addition, the impression that in any event no aluminium could beobtained discouraged those in charge from repeating the experiment until mid-summer, 1943. It was only when the Paymaster-General&apos;s attention was drawn to an alleged superiority of German explosives, as stated above, that the necessaryimpetus was given to turn the lessons of fresh experiments to account.4. There is no doubt that the power of aluminized explosives is very muchgreater than that of the types which were being used earlier, and ?I have -thoughtit right to bring to the notice of my colleagues the important service rendered bythe Paymaster-General in calling attention to a most unsatisfactory state totaffairs which might have continued for some time, with serious detriment to our war effort, unless he had intervened.W.
