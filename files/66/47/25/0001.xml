J &apos;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET Copy No.W.P. (44) 125.19th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.        \jUNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.AS indicated in paragraph 3 of C.O.S. (44) 58 (Of of the 26th January,Marshal Stalin was understood to have expressed the view at Tehran thatunconditional surrender was bad tactics vis-a-vis Germany, and to have suggestedthat terms of surrender should be worked out and made generally known to theGerman people.2. The preparation of a draft declaration was at once taken in hand in theForeign Office and on the 17th December it was suggested to the Soviet and united States Governments, through the diplomatic channel, that the matter might be examined urgently by the European Advisory Commission. There hasbeen no response to this approach from the Soviet Government and in a telegram to the Prime Minister President Roosevelt has suggested that his statement ofthe 24th December, 1943, quoted in the Prime Ministers paper W.P. (44) 33 ofthe 15th January, would be sufficient for the present.3. In his paper the Prime Minister raises the question whether, in viewof what is in fact likely to happen to Germany, it is possible to take the matterany further and he suggests that a frank statement would not necessarily havea reassuring effect upon the German people.4. I should like to say in the first place that I agree with the view expressedin paragraph 8 of the C.O.S. paper that it is neither possible nor desirable toabandon at this stage the &apos;&apos; unconditional surrender &apos;&apos; formula, though I shouldmyself see some advantage in not overstressing it in our propaganda.5. As regards a pronouncement by the three Heads of Governments, I amconscious of the difficulties set out by the Prime Minister. I think none the lessthat such a pronouncement would be helpful if reserved for a suitable psycho-logical moment, and provided the contents do not expose us to a charge of bad faith later. The use made by Nazi propaganda of the alleged repudiation by theAllies of President Wilson&apos;s 14 Points is sufficient warning of the long-termdangers involved, whatever the short-term advantages may be.6. The draft declaration annexed to this paper is the best that we havebeen able to do. I think it covers, in their broadest aspect, all the pointsadvanced by the Prime Minister, avoids any commitment which might prove embarrassing for the future, and might yet be expected to encourage the germans to feel that even in defeat there was some hope for their future.7. If my colleagues share this view, I should be in favour of trying to persuade President Roosevelt and Marshal Stalin to agree to the issue at asuitable moment of a joint pronouncement on these lines.A.
