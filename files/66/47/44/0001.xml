THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT   (9Printed for the War Cabinet.  March 1944.W.P. (44) 144..Srd March, 1944.SECRET.Copy No.3 5152WAR CABINET.AUSTRALIA-NEW ZEALAND AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.WITH reference to my Cabinet paper W.P. (44) 108 and the foreign secretary&apos;s paper W.P. (44) 107, I have now received from the Australian HighCommissioner in London, and circulate herewith, a copy of the reply returned byDr. Evatt to the United States Minister at Canberra.It will be seen that in this reply Dr. Evatt adheres firmly to his proposalfor the holding of an International Conference in the Pacific this summer for thediscussion of regional defence questions. We had taken the line, in replying tothe Australian Government, that this was a matter which had best be discussed at the forthcoming meeting of Prime Ministers, and I assume that we should adhere to this line.  In that case no further action by us is called for at present.I have the honour to inform you that careful consideration has been given tothe recent message of the Secretary of State to the Prime Minister, dated the3rd February, and relating in the main to the time of calling the conference-contemplated in Clause 34 of the Australia-New Zealand Agreement, 1944.I note the important suggestion of the Secretary of State that the AustralianPrime Minister should discuss the matter at Washingon while en route to theforthcoming talks in London between the Prime Ministers of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations. It was agreed between Australia and New Zealandduring the recent Canberra Conference that the proposed international conference should not take place before the London talks, and we readily acceptthe suggestion of an informal discussion at Washington.:,While this answers the main suggestion of the Secretary of State, there are other observations in his message which require comment so that there shall beno misunderstanding of Australia^ general policy.The general tenor of his message is that the holding of a &quot; formalised &apos;&apos; or&quot; formal &quot; conference may not be desirable at the present time. However, the degree of form or formality which might attach to the proposed conference is.amatter on which prior agreement should easily be obtained. Of course we are more interested in the substance than, in the form of the &quot;frank exchange of views &quot; envisaged in Article 34 of the Australia-New Zealand Agreement.-;It is the opinion of the Australian Government that the prosecution of thewar, especially in the Pacific, would be aided by such a frank and friendlyexchange of views. If it appeared that the Powers with territorial interests inthe South Pacific were determined to safeguard the future welfare and good government of all native peoples, it is certain that the joint war effort against japan would be aided; something of positive value could be presented to theworld as an answer to Japanese political and economic propaganda within greatareas not yet liberated.The message under reply rather assumes that Australia and New Zealandwished the problems of regional defence to be dealt with prior to, and irrespectiveC.Dominions Office, 3rd March, 1944.Sir,24tth February, 1944.F270361
of! arrangements for a general international security system. This is not-so. &apos;The Agreement between Australia and New Zealand makes the position very clear. ; Article 13 speaks of a regional zone defence&quot; within the framework of ageneral system of world security.&quot; Further, the obvious intention both ofAustralia and New Zealand was that any discussions of regional defence shouldbe:&apos;related at all times to the plans for a general international organisationreferred to in the Moscow Declaration of October 1943. With that organisation .Australia and New Zealand desire to be associated&apos;at the planning stages aridbefore any definite proposals are formulated vide Article 14.&apos;,-The Australian Government finds it difficult to appreciate the suggestion thata conference in Australia of the representatives of every Allied Power without;,exception interested in the South Pacific area, whether held formally or inform- aally, could create any reasonable ground whatsoever for objection or suspicion. Onthe contrary such a federation should, in our view, be a helpful contribution to themaintenance of harmonious action amongst the United Nations.   All the matters ;covered by the Australia-New Zealand Agreement have post-war relevance andsome.matters will form the content of post-war settlement in this part of theworld.   The purpose of the conference is to ensure that the discussion of thesegreat matters is set on foot in good time so as to avert the grave risk ofinsufficiently considered decisions which, through the great pressure of events at ortowards close of hostilities, may prejudice a final peace settlement.Even in the midst of war every principal Government of the United Nationshas found it necessary to concern itself with these vital post-war problems, aridnearly all have established agencies for the purpose of making suitable plans andarrangements. In this connexion it is appropriate to emphasise that no country has more frequently taken the initiative than the United States, and that in all such matters the United States has received the fullest possible support both frondAustralia and New Zealand.We feel strongly that Australia and New Zealand are entitled to the fullestdegree of preliminary consultation, especially in relation to Pacific matters. Atthe recent Cairo Conference decisions affecting the future of certain portions ofthe Pacific, and vitally affecting both Australia and New Zealand, were not onlymade but publicly announced, without any prior reference either to Australia or new Zealand. Actually the first news the Australian Government received ofthe Cairo decisions was through the medium of the press.Further, it is gradually becoming clear that certain Governments, includingthe United States Government, are tending to indicate their policy, though notpublicly, on important phases of the Pacific settlement. For instance at the pacific Council on the 31st March, 1943, the President said he had discussed with;Mr. Eden different island territories in the Pacific. The President expressed.opinions not only as to sovereignty but as to proposed provisions for co-ordination.The President added that he had also discussed with Mr. Eden the question of japanese mandated islands and of Timor.Subsequently on the 29th September, 1943, also at the Pacific Council, thePresident referred to the Marshall and Caroline and other islands east of the philippines. He indicated the existence of plans to determine what post-war policy should be adopted for the maintenance of peace in that part of the Pacific;Very recently at the meeting of the Pacific Council on the 12th January last,the President communicated his views regarding the future of the Pacific islandsboth north and south of the equator. With reference to the latter he spoke of thepossibility of &quot; some arrangement &quot; for their future allocation.In the course of the meeting on the 12th January the President referred tothe special question of what should be done with the French islands. The-President stated that he had told Mr. Churchill that the French should not have-New Caledonia back under any conditions, and that he believed in this viewAustralia and New Zealand would back him up.It is realised that the President may not have been speaking definitively onthese matters, but they are cited as illustrations of the fact that in matters oftremendous consequence to Australia and New Zealand post-war arrangements are under consideration by the United States Government.We fear that they may be dealt with in a way which can be prejudicial toa harmonious Pacific settlement. For instance, I should mention that Australiais under a deep obligation to Fighting France. It is publicly pledged to do itsutmost to maintain the sovereignty of France in its present South Pacificpossessions.  Similar pledges have been given by other (? Governments)&apos;.We trust the United States Governfnent will appreciate that our reference&apos;to France is intended merely to indicate in our view the danger of postponing a
frank exchange of views which is the purpose of the conference referred to inarticle 34 of the Australia-New Zealand Agreement.It is also pointed out that Australia^ proposal to call an international conference was announced in a speech delivered by myself as long ago as the12th October of last year.It is the hope &quot;of the Australian Government that the proposed conference should be held about July of the present year. Therefore we request that whenthe time comes for a decisi6n the United States Government will give theconference such active and vigorous support as will help to secure its success.As I have already mentioned, the United States has, during the present war,frequently taken the initiative in matters designed to secure closer collaborationamong groups of the United Nations in matters of common interest. this initiative has extended to matters of regional co-operation, e.g., the CaribbeanCommission. Now, when Australia and New Zealand have taken the initiative in relation to an important aspect of future international collaboration in their part of the world, we confidently ask the United States for understanding and sympathy commensurate with that which has always been extended by bothAustralia and New Zealand.I have, &amp;cH. V. EVATT.i
