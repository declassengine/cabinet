Z if.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 130.24:th February, 1944APPLICATION OF ALLIED POWERS (MARITIME COURTS)ACT, 1941, TO FRANCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department.I have been considering, in the light of the Memorandum of the lord president of the Council (W.P. (44) 124), what responsibilities and liabilitieswould fall on me as Home Secretary in the event of the establishment of a FrenchMaritime Court in this country. So far as I understand it, the position appearsto be as follows : 2. A French Maritime Court, if established in pursuance of an Order inCouncil under Section 1 (2) of the Allied Powers (Maritime Courts) Act, 1941,would be in the same position as the Maritime Courts of the Allied Powers, andFrench seamen would have the same rights and liabilities in respect of arrest,detention and. trial as other seamen of Allied Powers who are subject to thejurisdiction of their National Maritime Courts.These rights and liabilities are regulated by the Act, which provides(Section 5) that process, whether by warrant or summons, can be issued only bya British Justice of the Peace on a sworn information. Section 8 provides thata certificate of a Maritime Court in the prescribed form shall be a sufficientwarrant for the detention of any person, and that while so detained in any BritishPrison such person is to be treated in accordance with the Prison Rules. MaritimeCourts have no jurisdiction to try British subjects (Section 2) and the Actcontains provisions for enabling claims to British nationality to be determinedby local tribunals appointed by the Lord Chancellor (Section 9 and, the first schedule).3. Section 11 of the Act provides for the finality of the decisions of MaritimeCourts save that the High Court may consider applications for a declaration that the Maritime Court has exceeded the jurisdiction conferred by the Act.Section 12 gives an express indemnity to any person in respect of acts done in good faith and in purported exercise of the powers conferred by the Act inconnection with the trial or punishment of any person by the Maritime Court if-it subsequently appears that such person was not subject to the jurisdiction of theCourt, or that the jurisdiction of the Court was exceeded.4. It may also be relevant to call attention to the provisions of Section 1 (4)of the Act which provides that after the gazetting of a Notice of the establishmentof any Maritime Court any proceeding of that Court shall be presumed to be aproceeding of a lawfully constituted court having the jurisdiction conferred onsuch courts by the Act.5. In my view, the Home Secretary appears to have no liability for anythingdone in connection with the arrest, trial or punishment of persons dealt with bya Maritime Court, and these provisions seem satisfactorily to safeguard theposition of the police and prison officials who may be concerned in carryingout the decisions of a French Maritime Court if it were decided as a matterof policy that one should be established in this country.J H.
