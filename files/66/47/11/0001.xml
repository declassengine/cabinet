THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited/ it is issued for the personal use of most SECRET \ / Copy No. 3W.P. (44) 111.IQth February, 1944.WAR CABINET.THE FUTURE OF INDO-CHINA AND OTHER FRENCH PACIFICPOSSESSIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.President Roosevelt has recently made it clear that, in his opinion, Indo-China should not revert to France.2. I circulate, for consideration by my colleagues, a digest of a ForeignOffice memorandum on the future of Indo-China and French possessions in the pacific (Annex 1), together with a minute by the Post Hostilities planning committee (Annex 2), commenting on the memorandum. These two papers reach the same conclusions in regard to the continuance of French sovereignty overFrench possessions in the Pacific area. If they are accepted by the Cabinet itappears desirable to consult the Dominion Governments at the earliest opportunitywith a view to forming an Imperial policy.3. I would point out that this is not simply a long-term issue, but oneaffecting our day-to-day relations with the French and. our political warfarepolicy towards Indo-China. In recent months the French Committee of national liberation have indicated that they desire to participate in the Allied operations in the Far East and that they are preparing forces for this purpose. They have put forward certain requests such as that they should be allowed to attach aliaison mission to Headquarters, South-East Asia Command, and also that they shall be allowed to co-operate in propaganda to Indo-China. It will only bepossible to deal with these and other connected problems relating to the prosecution of the war in the Far East when a decision on the major question of policy raised in the attached memoranda has been reached.4. Finally, if the Cabinet favour the continuance of French sovereignty itwill be desirable to take the matter up with the United States Government witha view to avoiding a conflict of policy in an area which is likely to become the scene of active Allied operations.A. E.Foreign Office,Wth February, 1944.ANNEX 1.Indo-China and French Possessions in the Pacific.IN spite of the pledges of various kinds which the United States Governmenthave given to the French, President Roosevelt has recently declared that Indo-China should be placed under a United Nations trusteeship, the duty of whichwould be to educate the people towards self-government.12281   [26946]
22. This is a question of high policy on which an early decision is necessaryfor the following reasons :- (1) The President^ views will probably soon be known to the French, whowill react violently.(2) Until a decision is reached we cannot decide whether or not to grant the French requests for permission to attach a liaison mission toS.E.A.C. for representation on the Pacific Council and for a say in propaganda to Indo-China. These requests are long-standing and failure to meet them must create suspicion and ill-feeling.(3) There is a risk indeed a probability that the Americans will at any moment start a line of propaganda to Indo-China conflicting withour own.3. It is suggested that our policy should be governed by the followingprincipal considerations : 1(a) It should be an Imperial policy agreed with the Dominions.(b) It should be designed to promote the strategic security of the Common-wealth and Empire as a whole.(c) The menace of a rearmed Germany being greater than the menace of arearmed Japan, a friendly and prosperous France is a strategicnecessity to the Commonwealth and Empire as a whole.id) It should be of a nature to encourage the United States to the fullestparticipation in collective security.4. Our failure to defend Singapore, and consequently Australia and NewZealand, and the fact that their defence has been undertaken by the Americans,has profoundly affected the attitude of these two Dominions. Canada, too, isnow much more closely attached to the United States. It is therefore essentialto discuss Pacific affairs with the Dominions at every stage and try to agreewith them&apos; on a common policy. They will probably pay great attention to anyviews expressed by the United States, and will welcome eagerly anything thatlooks like American willingness to accept a strategic commitment in the Pacific development which we, too, desire.5. It is suggested that we should approach the Dominions on the following lines : (A) We should inform them fully of our plans for a system of securitycomprising all colonial areas in the Pacific, and explain that we arenow considering how far we are prepared to apply in our own coloniesarrangements for international consultation, joint use of bases, &amp;c.This closely concerns Australia and New Zealand, who have colonialresponsibilities in the Pacific, as well as Canada and South Africa,who are similarly interested in British colonies in the Caribbean and africa.(B) We are ready to co-operate with the United States in insisting thatany measures which we agree to apply to our colonies should be applied by the French to theirs. If the French agree to this, they should retain their Pacific colonies for the following reasons : (a) To deprive France of her economic stake in Indo-China would weaken her severely.(&amp;) Any such deprivation would be passionately resented, with theresult that the possibilities of friendly collaboration with france in post-war Europe would be jeopardised, and france would be encouraged to form a bloc, possibly with the Russians,opposed to an Anglo-American bloc.(C) We should be ready, if necessary, to put pressure on France to take partin international arrangements, including, if found desirable, some system of United Nations bases in Indo-China, by telling her plainlythat she need not otherwise expect any support from us in maintainingher control over Indo-China or her other Pacific colonies. If sheagreed, we could hardly, in decency, deprive her of any of her colonies.(D) The alternatives to French control are -(a) International control. This we do not believe would work. Itwould open the door to Chinese intrigues, and would providepossibilities for Japanese exploitation.
(b) Control by some other Power. Neither we nor the Dutch would want to take this on. The Russians are unlikely to be interested.Chinese control would be worse than international control.American control might appeal to Australia and New Zealand.It would have the advantage of making it harder for the americans to point their fingers at our colonies. It would bedifficult to oppose it without ranging the Pacific Dominionsagainst us, which would be a&apos; greater evil. But the wholeAmerican tradition makes it extremely unlikely that they would want to take on any such commitments. -French  control   remains,   therefore,   the  most  tenableproposition.(E) If the Dominions agree that France should retain Indo-China subject tothe application of any measures applied to our colonies, they should agree that she should also retain her position, on the same conditions,,in New Caledonia, the New Hebrides, Tahiti and other Frenchpossessions.6.   Conclusions: (a) Our policy regarding French Pacific possessions should be framed inconsultation with the Dominions.(b) It should aim at allowing French sovereignty to continue on thecondition (1) that France accepts the same international arrange-ments for mutual consultation and security that are accepted by theBritish Empire; (2) that she agrees to the establishment ofinternational bases at strategic points (under United States controller otherwise); (3) that she gives the necessary guarantees to enablesuch bases to function properly.(c) We should endeavour, with the support of the Dominions, to persuade the United States to agree to (b). ,C^ P*uJ yvdvANNEX 2.P.H.P. (44) 2 (O).   (Final.)22nd January, 1944.WAR CABINET.Post-Hostilities Planning Sub-Committee.FRENCH POSSESSIONS IN THE PACIFIC.Comments by the Sub-Committee on Draft Note by the Foreign Office.1. The potential threat to India, and to Australia and New Zealand andBritish possessions in the South Pacific, resulting from Indo-China being in thehands of a weak or unfriendly Power has been sufficiently demonstrated by theaction of Japan in this war. Further, without American aid we have found our-selves unable to counter the development of this threat.2. Even if Japan is reduced to the status of a fourth-class Power after thewar, the possibility of a renewed threat in the Far East in course of time cannotbe entirely ruled out.  We should, therefore, insure against it.3. France is unlikely, for some time at least, to be strong enough to defendIndo-China by herself, and it is therefore important to the future security ofIndia, Burma and Malaya and of the British Commonwealth and Empire in theSouthern Pacific that the United States should be directly involved in the event ofan attack on Indo-China.4. President roosevelt&apos;s proposal would appear to ensure United Statesparticipation in the defence of Indo-China, but any suggestion that we would
support the United States in depriving France wholesale of such an importantpossession as Indo-China would be most strongly resented by the French, andwould seriously endanger our post-war co-operation with them. It is necessary,therefore, to consider the effect of an unfriendly France on our security elsewhere.5. The physical and economic obstacles to the re-emergence of Japan as a threat to our interests, once she has been defeated and deprived of her overseas and conquered territories, are enormous. Germany, by reasons of her own resources and her easy access to other European resources, could rearm comparativelyquickly once actual physical supervision had been removed. Geographically, arearmed Germany would constitute a more immediate menace to the Heart of theEmpire than a rearmed Japan to the security of the British Commonwealth and empire in the Far East. Therefore, the risk in Europe can be considered to be greater and relatively closer in time than that in the Far East.6. In view of her geographical position relative to the United Kingdom,we consider it strategically essential, so long as there is any threat of aggression6y a European Power, that our policy should aim at maintaining a strong and friendly France, or that even if she remains weak she should at least be friendly.7. In order to provide a greater measure of security in the Far East it isessential to have United States participation; but we should try to secure this without antagonising France, since to do so would be to insure against one dangerat the cost of exposing ourselves to another more immediate and vital to theEmpire       whole.8. We conclude, therefore, that our policy for Indo-China should be toencourage American co-operation in its defence, without prejudicing our friendly relations with France by laying ourselves open to the charge of conniving at an infringement of her sovereignty on the mainland of Asia. This might best beachieved by the establishment of some system of United Nations bases in Indo-China, rather than by depriving France of her possessions.
