Aircraft Carriers Dispositions and Movements(to 18th February, 1944).1. Fleet Carriers.H.M.S. Furious On the 12th February, H.M.S. Furious, covered by a detachment of the Home Fleet, including the BattleshipsAnson and Richelieu, returned to Scapa after a sweepof the Norwegian Leads directed against enemy shipping.No convoys were found, and the aircraft attacked abeached merchant vessel under repair which was being prepared for towing to harbour. The ship was hit eighttimes during the course of a dive-bombing attack by tenBarracudas.The striking force, which had left H.M.S. Furiousstanding out to sea, was covered by twelve Seafireswhich dealt with opposition from F.W. 190&apos;s andMe 109&apos;s and enabled &quot;the Barracudas to get back to the parent ship without loss. One Me. 109 was destroyed and. two others damaged at the cost of one Seafire.Operating with the Eastern Fleet equipped withBarracudas and Corsairs and supported by H.M.S.Unicorn as?aircraft repair ship.In the United States for repairs, after damage bytorpedo attack off Sicily in August 1943. Is now-expected to be ready for service at the end of May, when she is to join the Eastern Fleet.Completing refit at Liverpool. Due to join the EasternFleet in May.Completing refit at Belfast.

Expected to start trials, &amp;c.in June.The opportunity which has been taken to refit and modernise the FleetCarriers will enable a powerful carrier force to be assembled in the EasternTheatre in the latter half of 1944.[27058] bH.M.S.

2. Escort Carriers.(i) The Escort Carriers have continued successfully to give cover to theNorth Atlantic and. Gibraltar convoys against attacks by TT-Boat and long-rangeaircraft, and one escort carrier is operating in the Indian Ocean. Owing to theenemy&apos;s reluctance to surface or attack by day, night flying has been added tothe Escort Carriers roles. Losses in convoy have been negligible but contacts with the enemy have been few.The following incidents are typical of the work of these ships : On the 1st December, about 200 miles to the S.W. of Ireland, H.M.S.Fencer, with Convoy OS.60, sighted a F.W. 200 crossing ahead of the convoy.The weather conditions were poor, with low cloud and indifferent visibility.Two Wildcats did well to make a successful interception and shoot theenemy into the sea in flames.The same carrier made contact with a U-Boat on the 10th February alittle further to the north. The submarine was caught by a Swordfish4 miles on the port quarter of the convoy (ON.223) and was straddled inthe ensuing attack: provisional assessment &quot;probably sunk/&apos;An unusual, though indecisive, action arose on the 16th January out ofthe visual sighting from the Bridge of H.M.S. Striker of a Ju. 290 at theunprecedented distance of 32 miles. Two Hurricanes were ranged and tookoff with a wind speed, over the deck of only twenty-two knots. In theconditions of extreme visibility existing, the enemy was sighted by the aircraft at 20 miles and the chase continued up to a distance of 70 miles from the convoy, where the enemy escaped into a bank of cloud after an indecisiveaction.On the 12th February H.M.S. Pursuer, with convoy MKS.40, flew offfour Wildcats half an hour after sunset. In the gathering darkness theysuccessfully intercepted three of a force of seven enemy aircraft which hadbeen plotted in the vicinity of the convoy. The attack on the convoy wasfrustrated and one He. 117 and one F.W 200 were destroyed, and anotherF.W. 200 damaged before the Wildcats landed on again in total darkness.On the morning of the 16th February a Ju. 290 made an unsuccessfulglider bomb attack on convoy OS.68 escorted by Biter and Tracker. Twoof Biter&apos;s Wildcat&apos;s made a successful interception and shot one engine outof the enemy aircraft, which crashed, into the sea in flames. Simultaneouslya Coastal Command Beaufighter was directed by H.M.S. Tracker on to asecond Ju. 290, which shared a similar fate.(ii) A total of six Escort Carriers have so far been specially equipped with fighter aircraft for the support of amphibious operations. Some have beenemployed on convoy defence and training continues pending decision on future operations.(iii) H.M.S. Sling er, a new Escort Carrier, was mined in the North sea on the 5th February. The ship was towed into harbour and will be out of action for some months.. (iv) Other Escort Carriers have been employed in ferrying reserve and replacement aircraft from the United States to the United, Kingdom and to theFar East. As transports these ships can carry about 65 aircraft in closely stowedconditions and are ideal for this important service for which carriers are inconstant use by the United States and ourselves as well as by the Japanese (seephotographs Nos. 1 and 2).(v) The two deck landing training carriers working in the Clyde havequalified 217 pupils and given refresher courses to 65 others in addition to training other carriers&apos; deck handling parties.(vi) The trials Carrier Pretoria Castle continues to give valuable service intesting new apparatus and conducting experiments and research. A feature ofthe work during this period has been a protracted visit by the Supermarinerepresentatives in connection with investigations into the possibility of improving the deck landing capabilities of the Seafire aircraft and its derivatives.3. M.A.C. Ships.(i) The M.A.C. Ships, with their small complements of aircraft, continue tosail the North Atlantic and have given protection to 45 Convoys. Fourteen ofthese ships are now operating and the excellent preliminary results achieved bythem and reported in&quot; the summary for the last quarter have been maintained.Some astonishing feats of flying have been achieved in these ships; on one occasion
an aircraft was landed on in mid-Atlantic in fog with visibility only about50 yards and on another an aircraft landed on safely in a 60-mile-an-hour gale.They have earned many tributes from Commodores of convoys and others. Theair contingents of two of these ships are to be manned by the Royal NetherlandsNavy.(ii) Owing to the present large demand on shipping space for the transportof all types of aircraft from the United States to the United Kingdom,&quot; theM.A.C. Ships are to be used as aircraft transports on their return trips from theUnited States until transport requirements can again be met by normal means.Section II. Detached Naval Squadrons Operating from Shore Bases.4. No. 841 Squadron (Albacores and Swordfish) which for sixteen monthswas lent to operate under R.A.F. control in conjunction with Naval Light SurfaceForces in the Channel area, handed over its aircraft to No. 415 Royal CanadianAir Force Squadron in November, prior to re-equipping with Barracudas for service afloat.Tributes have been paid to the keenness and efficiency of this squadron, whichhas accounted for a substantial number of enemy light craft, mostly E- andR-boats, in night attacks, for the loss of only one aircraft.There are now no Naval Air Squadrons on operational duty at shore bases.Section III. Aircraft.5. British Aircraft.(i) Two Firefly Squadrons are now working up for service in Fleet Carriers.The first is to be embarked in H.M.S. Indefatigable and the second in H.M.S.Implacable. They will operate initially as fighter and reconnaissance aircraft;later versions will be equipped as fighter bombers and, others as night fighters.(ii) The Seafire Mk. Ill the first of the Seafire family to be fitted withfolding wings is now in production and squadrons are re-equipping with this type.   The first will embark in H.M.S. Implacable.(iii) The prototypes of the Seafire XV which is a considerable advance onthe Seafire III are now flying and production should begin at the end ofthis year.6. American Aircraft.(i) It has been decided to adopt the American name Avenger for the torpedoaircraft supplied to us by the United. States which we had previously called theTarpon-this was done in deference to the wishes of the American manufacturers.(ii) The American aircraft continue to give satisfactory service.   There are.now twelve squadrons of Avengers, six squadrons of Corsairs and six of Hellcats.Difficulties have arisen with the United States over further assignments of these and other types, except the Corsairs, and unless these difficulties are satisfactorilyresolved we shall be unable to form the additional squadrons which we need.[27058]
