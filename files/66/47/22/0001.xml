THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1944.SECRET. ^Copy No.W.P. (44) 122.18th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.HOUSING IN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.IN W.P. (44) 110 the Minister of Reconstruction has recommended that legislation should be enacted conferring on Public Authorities statutory powersto purchase land compulsorily at 1939 prices.2. I hope my colleagues will consider carefully whether this would reallybe equitable. Public opinion will readily endorse the principle that landownersshould not make any profit out of the war, but that is a very different principle to the recommendation referred to.3. I am not aware of any commodity that can now be purchased at 1939prices, whether it be labour, raw materials, manufactured goods, unsubsidisedfood or what not. It is surely indisputable that the purchasing power of ourcurrency has depreciated since 1939. To pay a man, therefore, the 1939 sterlingprice for a commodity acquired in 1944 is to pay him in depreciated currency.4. I suggest that in all the circumstances of the case the equitable price topay for land compulsorily acquired is the 1939 price plus the difference in the purchasing power of the currency during the interval. Unless this is done theGovernment will be discriminating against landowners.5. It is of fundamental importance that all our reconstruction plans shouldbe based on equity. No inequitable settlement is likely to command general assent.aMinistry of Economic Warfare,18th February, 1944.[26956]
