0 c.t.^i.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT       f ^ C,Printed for the War Cabinet.   February 1944. 2&apos;QSECRET. , Copy No,W.P. (44) 108.15th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.- AUSTRALIA-NEW ZEALAND AGREEMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State- for Dominion Affairs.I circulate, for the information.-of my colleagues, the following telegrams from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in New Zealand regarding there actions of the United States Government to the recent Australia-New ZealandAgreement.C.Dominions Office, 15th February, 1944.(No. 62.)Addressed to Dominions Office, No. 62. Repeated to the High Commissioner,Canberra, No. 8, Secret.The Prime Minister has communicated to me&apos; the text of a Note from theUnited States Charge d&apos;Affaires Containing a message from Mr. Cordeli Hullas set out in my immediately following telegram.* &quot; -The Prime Minister told the Charge d&apos;Affaires orally that he was glad toreceive Mr. HuLTs message, that there was no intention of calling the conferenceuntil after the Prime Ministers&apos; meeting in London, and that for his part he agreed to full discussion in Washington when Curtin and he were there on their way to London. He subsequently sent the Charge d Affaires a short noteconfirming the above and adding that a formal reply as to the other matters inthe Note would he sent later.The Prime Minister has subsequently told me that Curtin desired that australia and New Zealand should send identical replies. This would, in hisopinion, be a mistake and, so far as New Zealand was concerned, he did not wishhis formal reply to go beyond an offer to discuss in Washington.I enquired whether he proposed to send to you officially the text of Mr. Hull&apos;message together with the terms of his proposed reply. I pointed out thatMr. HiriTs message related to a proposed conference to which the UnitedKingdom was to be invited and dealing with matters of close interest to theUnited Kingdom Government, and that it would seem proper, therefore, thatthey should be consulted before any reply was sent. He said he did not proposeto send you an official telegram,- but I was entirely at liberty to communicate toyou the text of Mr. Hull&apos;s message, together with the lines of his proposed reply.I understand that the New Zealand High Commissioner in Canberra has beeninformed that the text of the message has been communicated to me, and hasbeen asked to suggest to Evatt that a copy should be given by the commonwealth government to Cross.Speaking Confidentially the Prime Minister said that he was rather glad thatthe incident had occurred as ;&apos; it brought matters into the open.&quot; He is, I think,secretly pleased that the Americans have immediately reacted, as he warnedCurtin and Evatt that they, would. He is also, I suspect, not entirely displeasedthat the practical difficulties of the provisions for consultation in the agreement are already being.shown up.* Not reproduced. The text of the United States Note quoted in telegram No. Go hasalready been reproduced in W.P; (44) 107.&apos; [26928]-
(No. 66.)To Dominions Office, No. 66. Repeated to High Commissioner, CanberraNo. 9, Secret. .    .My telegram No. 68.* The whole conversation was of the most frank and friendly nature.The Prime Minister spoke in terms of warm gratitude of the manner, inwhich you had publicly referred to the Agreement. &quot;To have shown any sign ofsoreness (and I think that he realises that there is some ground&apos;:f Or such a feeling)would have been a great mistake. It was most important to do nothing toantagonise Evatt, who was now &quot;On Our side.&quot;&apos;. WHe spoke again of the importance which he attached to the United Kingdomremaining in the Pacific and of the pleasure which it would give him to see UnitedKingdom Forces coming out here in the near future.The. Prime Minister evidently regards himself as precluded by the termsof the Agreement from communicating with you officially on a question such as has arisen without prior consultation with Curtin. He does not, however,regard himself as precluded from communicating information and news to meon the understanding that 1 am at liberty to pass them on to you.It does not appear to have occurred to the Prime Minister that in factClause 2 of the Agreement relates only to the expression of views to a third party and does not preclude the communication of information without consultation,but I doubt whether it is wise to take up this point with him at the moment/* See footnote on preceding page.
