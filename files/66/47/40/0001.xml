THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  Marsh 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 140.1st March, 1944.WAR CABINET. &apos; /REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF JANUARY 1944 FOR THE DOMINIONS,INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES AND mandated territories.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.CANADA.MUCH discussion has taken place in Canada over Lord Halifax&apos;s address atthe centenary dinner of the Toronto Board of Trade. Lord Halifax expressed his belief that it was &quot; both desirable and necessary in all the fields of interests-common to every part of the Commonwealth in foreign policy, in defence, in economic affairs, in colonial questions and in communications, that nothing shouldbe left undone to bring our people into closer unity of thought and action.&quot;2. Newspapers with a &quot; nationalist&quot; outlook at once suggested comparisonwith Field-Marshal Smuts&apos;s speech of November last. Many newspapers carriedleading articles claiming that the speech represented an official declaration ofthe policy of the United Kingdom Government and, as such, should be vigorouslyresisted, if Canada were to maintain her independence. With regard to thesepress criticisms, it must be remembered that the appropriate machinery for ensuring Commonwealth co-operation has become a matter of party politics inCanada, with the Progressive Conservatives generally supporting the proposalsof Mr. Curtin, the Australian Prime Minister, and the Liberals and C.C.F.,supporting the traditional policy of Mr. Mackenzie King of leaving the machineryof consultation on its present informal basis. The French Canadian press wouldhave been more bitter in its attack if it had been made by anyone other than lord halifax, for whom French Canadians have a high regard.3. In addressing the House of Commons, on this matter, the Prime Ministertook occasion to point out that Lord Halifax was simply expressing his own opinion, and that his speech was not in any sense a declaration of British policy.He himself welcomed co-operation and discussion on all matters of concernbetween the nations of the Commonwealth. Mr. Mackenzie King said that aconcrete issue in external policy had been raised both by Lord Halifax and field-Marshal Smuts. They expressed the view that the future peace of theworld depended upon the attainment of equal partnership in strength and influence between the Great Powers among the United Nations. They took theline that the resources and man-power of the British Islands were too small toenable the United Kingdom to compete with the United States and the soviet union in power and authority after the war. Both, therefore, argued that it wasnecessary that the United Kingdom should have the constant support of othercountries in order to preserve a proper balance. &quot; With what is implied in this argument by both these eminent public men,&quot; said Mr. Mackenzie King, &quot;I amunable to agree.&quot; &quot; What we must strive for is the closest co-operation among those great States themselves and all other like-minded countries.&quot; &amp;4.   The speech from the Throne at the opening of the Canadian parliament on the 27th January foreshadowed the establishment of three new Departments,[27000]      &quot; jj
each, with its own Minister and responsible for carrying out post-war planning.The Department of Veterans&apos; Affairs will deal with the questions of rehabihta-tion; the Department of Reconstruction will promote and co-ordinate planning for national development and post-war employment, and the Department of social welfare will organise and assist in administering the activities of the federal government in the fields of Health and Social Insurance.5. The National Council of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation held a conference at Regina, at which it was suggested that a uniform labour standardshould be established, and that greater educational assistance should be given.The Conference further recommended adequate minimum and fair wage legisla-tion covering all workers, including farm workers and domestics. This partysuffered a very heavy defeat in both the New Year provincial by-elections inAlberta and the Toronto Municipality. In the latter their twelve candidates for the City Council were all defeated. The Liberal and Conservative press claim that this result has proved that the Co-operative Commonwealth Federationsuccess in the Ontario provincial elections was due to divisions between itsopponents.6. Colonel Drew, Premier of Ontario, has now returned to Ontario fromthe United Kingdom. It is thought that he will seek a dissolution of the OntarioLegislature in order to obtain an absolute majority for his party. TheCo-operative Commonwealth Federation now constitute the official Opposition,with the Liberals holding the balance of power.7. The production capacity of Canada is now double that of the pre-war level, and with an increase in her export trade the national income shows afurther substantial rise. Half of all Canadian production is devoted to war purposes. Exports of Canadian food-stuffs have increased over three times sincethe war began.8. The Belgian Legation in Ottawa has been raised to the status of anEmbassy, with Baron Silvercruys, the present Minister, as Belgium&apos;s firstAmbassador to Canada. M. Cito Freitas Vale has been appointed BrazilianAmbassador to Canada. The Canadian High Commissioner in Newfoundland,Mr. C. J. Burchell, has been appointed High Commissioner in South Africa.Mr. Justice Rinfret has been appointed Chief Justice of Canada in succession to Sir Lyman Duff.   The new Chief Justice is of French-Canadian extraction.9. There has been much outspoken comment on a reported disagreement between General McNaughton and General Montgomery. It is generally thoughtthat the former&apos;s retirement was connected with the collapse of an original plan for a separate Canadian Army. There has been much speculation over general mcnaughton&apos;s return to Canada at this stage of the war, and Mr. mackenzie king felt compelled to say that it would not be in the public interest to discuss it at present.*   Service Activities.10. Vice-Admiral Percy W. Nelles, C.B., R.C.N., has been appointedSenior Canadian Flag Officer, Overseas. He will supervise the affairs of theRoyal Canadian Navy in the United Kingdom or elsewhere overseas, and will maintain close liaison with the Admiralty, but will not exercise any operationalcommand.11. H.M.C. Destroyer A thabaskan helped to escort King George V, withthe Prime Minister on board, from Gibraltar to the United Kingdom.12. H.M.C. Destroyer Huron assisted in escorting a convoy from NorthernRussia.13. H.M.C.S. Mahone, Fleet Minesweeper, was badly damaged in collisionwith a merchant ship south of Nova Scotia on the 29th, but reached port safely.14. A Canadian Corps has now been formed in Italy, under the command of Lieut-General Crerar, as part of the Eighth Army.15. Operations during January in the Adriatic coastal sector held by the canadians were considerably influenced by weather. Severe winter conditions were experienced with snow on the high ground and rain and gales on the coast.At the beginning of the month the Canadians fought off one or two heavy counter-attacks against their positions about 2 miles north-west of Ortona. After this,no operations or positional changes of importance took place until the 17th, whenthe Canadians launched an attack with limited objectives.   The attack had some
initial success, but by the evening of the .18th, following heavy German counter-attacks, a withdrawal to the original positions was carried out. For the restof the month operations were confined to active patrolling by both sides.16. Bomber Squadrons of the R.C.A.F. attacked Berlin on five occasionsand also Brunswick, Stettin and Magdeburg.   Thirty-seven bombers were lost.17. Fighter Squadrons were less active than in December; seven Germansingle-engine fighters and one twin-engine fighter were destroyed.18. * Coastal Command Squadrons badly damaged an enemy destroyer andhit with rocket projectiles and cannon fire eight other ships and two escort vessels during the month; five of these vessels were left on fire.AUSTRALIA.19. The Australian and New Zealand Conference opened at Canberra onthe 17th January. At Mr. Curtin&apos;s opening speech, he explained that the objectof the Australian Government was to ensure that Australia and New Zealandshould take the lead in applying to the countries of the South and South-west pacific the principles of freedom from fear, want and repression. This objective of Australian and New Zealand foreign policy has since been embodied in theAustralian-New Zealand Agreement signed at the Conference. The agreement was regarded by Mr. Curtin as marking an important step in the working out of improved methods of consultation within the British Commonwealth. He addedthat the aim of the two Southern Dominions was simply the assumption ofresponsibility proper to themselves in its relation to the wider international field.Australia and New Zealand had every reason to welcome the co-operation of otherGovernments in the handling of regional matters in the Pacific. Mr. Fraser,the New Zealand Prime Minister, endorsed this view, and pointed out that new Zealand regarded her membership of the British Commonwealth of nations as the fundamental principle of her external policy. New Zealand would like tosee the machinery for co-operation within the British Commonwealth improved,and they looked forward also to- the institution of some universal organisation which would be empowered to preserve peace. Dr. Evatt, Minister of external affairs, said that there might well be a precedent of considerable value to othermembers of the British Commonwealth, especially in the provision for alternatemeetings of Ministers in the respective capitals, and in the setting up of apermanent Australian-New Zealand Secretariat, functioning in both countries.He described the Agreement as &quot; A Pacific Charter for permanent collaborationand co-operation.&quot; The Agreement is subject to ratification by the full cabinet of each country.20. Speaking at a meeting of the Australian Institute of Political Science,Mr. Menzies, the former Commonwealth Prime Minister, expressed his idealofone main foreign policy for the Empire. He suggested a. Committee of ImperialForeign-Policy, composed of the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of eachBritish country, and exchanges between officers of the Australian external affairs Department and senior officers of the United Kingdom Foreign Office, tosecure a common understanding, &quot; not possible by a few cables.&quot;21. The New South Wales Communist Party and the New South WalesLabour Party have now amalgamated, and this is a step towards the ultimateachievement of a single Australian working-class party. The party will seekaffiliation with the Federal Labour Party which is under Mr. Curtin&apos;s leadership.22. The Federal Executive Labour party has asked the Prime Minister tocarry out the party&apos;s post-war programme of ensuring a high standard of living,improved nutritional, health and education benefits, and the introduction of amaximum 40-hour working week, within six months after the end of the war..The Executive also demanded that the Government should appoint a specialMinister to be in charge of a new Department of Post-War Planning and construction, to replace the present Ministry of Post-War Reconstruction.23. In reviewing Australia^ man-power, a Government statement shows&apos;that of the male population of 2,830,000 over 14 years, 2 5 0 000 are in the forces or in employment. Of those in the Fighting Services, 7i oer cent, volunteered tofight &quot;anywhere.&quot; 30-1 per cent, of the women r in f-^-e Forces, or inemployment.[27000] -   n 2
24. Coal strikes continue to cause considerable concern, and already muchproduction has been lost in the first week of the New Year, a loss which is equalto one-quarter of the average weekly production in the Newcastle field.25. Mr. Makin, the Minister of the Navy, announced that during 1943Australia&apos;s shipyards repaired and manufactured merchant ships totalling13,815,000 tons:26. The Minister of Post-War Reconstruction, Mr. Chifley, has stated thatthe Government is determined to do everything possible to assist secondaryindustry in Australia to become an even more important factor in the economic life of the Commonwealth after the war than it had been hitherto. the secondary Industries Commission has undertaken the task of investigatingpossible uses to which munition plants could be put in peace time, in such a way as to fit them into the structure of Australia&apos;s economic life.27. Anxiety over the delays in obtaining the release of man-power fromthe factories for work on the land still continues. 11,903 persons were releasedduring the period March to November 1943.28. The &quot;White Australia&quot; policy has been widely discussed. TheMinister of Labour, Mr. Ward, in defending this policy, said that Labour support for the policy was not based on any claim of racial superiority, but was adopted on account of economic reasons.29. A &quot; first victory loan of  150 million &quot; has been launched by the PrimeMinister, who said that the emphasis should be on &quot;first&quot; rather than on&quot;victory.&quot;30. The award of the Victoria Cross to Private Kelliher brings the totalnumber of V.Cs. won by Australians in the present war to thirteen.31. Great bush fires which swept through certain country districts ofVictoria - caused enormous damage, over a million sheep alone having been destroyed, while many thousands of square miles of highly productive farming and pastoral lands have been rendered useless for a long period.32. General Sir John Lavarack, who commanded the main field forces inthe Syrian campaign, has succeeded Lieutenent-General Vernon Sturdee as headof the Australian Military Mission to Washington.Service A activities.33.   H.M.A.S. Barcoo, frigate, and H.M.A.S. Kiama, minesweeper, werecommissioned during the month and H.M.A.S. Batan, a Tribal class destroyer,.  was launched.34. A further shipment of over 500 Italian prisoners of war has arrived from india for agricultural employ; about 3,000 prisoners of war have now reachedAustralia from India.35. It has been decided to replace Australian Military Forces personnelmanning static Anti-Aircraft and Coast Artillery with full-time VolunteerDefence Corps. This will release a large number of A.M.F. troops for more active employment.36. The total United States forces (Army and Air Corps) in the South-west pacific area was 329,847 at the end of January.NEW ZEALAND.37. All sections of the press have been reserved in their comments on theAustralia-New Zealand agreement. (See under Australia.) Although fullapproval is given of the principles of closer collaboration in domestic matters,scepticism is expressed on harmonious, co-operation, remembering the &apos;&apos; long andimplacable battles fought by the Australian and New Zealand Government onsuch issues as potato blight and citrus fruit.&quot; While recognising that a united front by the two Dominions on matters of external policy will be necessary if theyare to participate fully in post-war planning, fear is expressed that NewZealand&apos;s own policy is in danger of becoming subordinate and that her freedom in her relations with the United Kingdom will be lost. Some measure of consulta-tion on matters of common concern is, however, generally recognised as desirable,on the ground that more heed will be paid to the two antipodean Dominions if
they are able to speak with one voice. No objection is seen to the clauses of theagreement which deal with the Armistice and subsequent arrangements, though itis thought that formal publication that the two Dominions wish to be represented at the highest level in all planning is inappropriate, and liable to give offence inother Allied countries. The declaration of Dominion readiness to share theresponsibility of post-war security, and of the close collaboration with Australiais welcomed. The suggested South Seas Regional Commission (paragraph 30 and31 of the Agreement) is thought to be generally in line with the United Kingdomviews on this problem. The argument in this case is that the -two southern dominions are entitled to a voice in the supervision of the Pacific Islands onaccount of the importance of the latter to the defence of the two Dominions. Theproposals in paragraphs 17-23 regarding Civil Aviation, in connexion with whichthe Australian-New Zealand Agreement states that the two Governments supportthe principles that Full control of the international trunk routes and the ownership of all aircraft and equipment should be vested in an International air transportauthority, and that the routes themselves should be specified in an inter-national agreement,&quot; were not well received, as doubt was felt whether eitherAustralia or New Zealand had yet sufficient information to warrant decisions on an International aviation policy.Service Activities.Navy.38. H.M.S. Gambia, partly New Zealand manned, has been operating underthe Admiralty.39, H.M.N.Z.S. Leander is still undergoing repairs and re-arming in theUnited States.40.   H.M.N.Z.S. Achilles is refitting and re-arming in the United Kingdom.41. An anti-submarine and minesweeping flotilla composed of H.M.N.Z.S.Matai, Kiwi and Tui is operating in the Solomon Islands area under the orders of Commander, South Pacific Area.42. Naval defence measures in New Zealand are being maintained on thebasis that threat of invasion and air attack is considered remote, but that anti-submarine measures are still necessary. It is proposed to close down a number of controlled mine and observation minefields. Those forming part of the defencesof Auckland and Wellington will remain in commission.43. Nineteen Minesweeping Trawlers, mostly fitted for anti-submarineduties, twelve Fairmile motor launches and eight FT arbour Defence motor launchesare employed at the four main ports where anti-submarine defences are also being maintained.44. Buildings and Works. Auckland. The Calliope Dock has beenlengthened and will now take any United States Cruiser. A motor launch baseis being built. To relieve congestion in the Dockyard and to provide adequatestorage, the Naval and Victualling Store Departments are being moved to ShoalBay.45. Wellington. Shelley Bay Base is expected to be completed early thisyear. A second 12,000-ton naval oil fuel storage tank has been completed and isin use.46. Lyttelton. The underground storage for 12,000 tons of oil fuel is proceeding slowly owing to shortage of man-power. The naval barracks are completed.47. Since the beginning of the war with Japan nearly 600 United Statesvessels have been repaired and, when necessary, docked in New Zealand undersupervision of the organisation controlled from the Navy Office, Wellington.Army.48. After the severe fighting in the Orsogna area during December, opera-tions quietened down in this sector, and consequently the 2nd New Zealand Divisiononly figured in a minor degree in the situation reports from Eighth Army. Onthe 8th January elements of the New Zealand Division annihilated a Germanpatrol in the Orsogna area, and on the night of the 11th/12th elements of the 5th
New Zealand Brigade, in conjunction with the 2nd Parachute Brigade, made aslight advance. Towards the middle of the month the 2nd New Zealand division was withdrawn from the line upon relief by the 4th Indian Division.49. On the 1st December, 1943, there were in New Zealand approximately14,000 all ranks of the United States forces (Army, Navy and Marines).50. Army reductions in New Zealand. Armoured Regiments have beenreduced to three, one each being located in the northern, central and southernMilitary Districts. The new organisation of anti-aircraft artillery in NewZealand provides for one composite anti-aircraft regiment, each at Auckland,Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin, and for one light anti-aircraft battery,less one mobile troop, in each of the three Military Districts, all on a mobile basis.All other anti-aircraft units in New Zealand are in the process of beingdisbanded.Air Force.51. Air Commodore A. de T. Neville, C.B.E., has returned to New Zealandfor air duty in the Air Department. Sis successor as Air Officer CommandingRoyal New Zealand Air Force Headquarters, London, will be Group CaptainE. G. Olson, D.S.O.52. The R.N.Z.A.F. is now forming four more Warhawk Squadrons in new Zealand for service in the Pacific; this will bring the strength of numberone R.N.Z.A.F. Islands Group to the following : &apos; Fighter Squadrons   ...       ....      ... ... ... ... 9Bomber Reconnaissance Squadrons ... ... ... 6Flying Boat Squadrons       ...       ... ... ... ... transport Squadrons         ...       ... ... ... ... 1In-addition one Squadron of Dive Bombers and one Squadron of torpedo bombers are completing training for overseas service.SOUTH AFRICA.53. The Union Parliament opened on the 22nd January with 56 new members, and the prospect of enough important legislation to keep it busy, it isexpected, until May. The political alignment of the House is virtually two party,with the Coalition Party, led by the Prime Minister, holding 105 seats, and an absolute majority of 57 in a House of 153 members, apart from the two Indepen-dents and three native representatives who are expected to support the Govern-ment on most issues. The Nationalist Party, shorn of the Afrikander Party andthe Pirow Group members, has diminished to 43. This, in fact, has given riseto misgivings in some quarters that the Governmenfs huge majority will affectthe efficiency of the Parliamentary machine.54. Much of the forthcoming legislation will be of a Social order,.and thiswill cause the Government to reckon with an unusually critical group of private members. The speech from the Throne did not contain any reference to concreteproposals for many post-war problems, but the Prime Minister has sinceannounced the order of priority of his legislative programme as (a) the War;(b) the demobilisation and rehabilitation of the returned soldier; and(c) the&apos; Union Government^ ideas of post-war world reconstruction as itwould affect South Africa.55. The Opposition did not raise any question of no confidence, but attacked the Government in a speech made by the leader Dr. Malan, who raised once again the issue of an independent South African Republic, anti-Communist, anti-capitalist, and separate from the Crown and the British Commonwealth ofNations. Dr. Malan argued that an Allied victory would mean the rapid spread of Communism, and not any restoration of Democracy on Western lines.56. General Smuts replied by repeating many of the views he had expressedwhile in Great Britain. He added that the Allies were fighting to eliminate anideology which has proved destructive, and that there was nothing in the atlantic charter implying a spirit to annihilate the enemy Powers. Dr. Malan based hisargument for a Republic on the belief that Great Britain&apos;s international position has radically changed, and that she is exhausted.   General Smuts refused,
however, to take this seriously, and retorted : &quot; With that weak and exhaustedally we are going forward towards one of the greatest victories in history. lneDebate, which is expected to continue for some time, was adjourned.57. The Van Eck Plan, the South African equivalent of the &quot; BeveridgePlan,&quot; is babied in Parliament as a White Paper. It represents the reports of theSocial Security Committee and the Social and Economic Planning Committee,to which will subsequently be added the report of the National Health services commission. The Minister of Finance, Mr. Hofmeyr, has warned parliament that, if this plan is to be carried out, the Union taxpayer must expect heaviertaxation in the next Budget, which is expected to be presented in March.58. The annual conference of the Labour Party held at the beginning ofthe month fell rather flat, the only resolution of public interest being one callingon the Government to pass the promised Social and Economic Security Act duringthe next session. Afrikaans Opposition newspapers bitterly attacked the LabourParty, possibly because they expected industrial trouble, particularly in the mines,and wish to capitalise this by winning over any dissatisfied workers to theOpposition.59. The Nationalist newspaper Die Burger has published a series of articlesby Mr. Jansen, the former Speaker of the House of Assembly, putting forward a programme for the attainment of a republic by constitutional means. these articles are interesting since they seem to indicate that the fiery brand ofTransvaal Nationalism is losing influence in the Opposition Party and that the powerful Cape Conservatives in the Nationalist Party are dissatisfied withMalan&apos;s leadership and are moving towards a revival of a more moderate policy.60. The Minister of Finance has stated that the increase in the cost ofliving had been slowed up in 1943. The Research Department of the SouthAfrican Trade and Labour, however, state that unless the spiralling of pricesof essential commodities is further checked, there will be demands for increases in wages from all industries. The Governments anti-inflation measures were notproving adequate in controlling goods manufactured in the Union, as muchinferior material, imported at high prices from the Argentine, Brazil and portugal, was being used, and greater co-operation between those responsible for price control and import control was accordingly urged.61. The Rand strike in the Crown Mine, Johannesburg, has ended with theappointment of an arbitrator, and the strike of native workers at the victoria falls Power Company has been settled after the management had agreed toconsider grievances. These strikes are thought by many members of the Govern-ment to be the prelude to widespread labour troubles in the Rand this year.62. A recruiting drive has been started in the Union. At least 10,000recruits would be needed in 1944 to keep the South African &quot; Invasion &quot; Forcesup to strength.EIRE.63. About 160 German survivors from the naval engagement which tookplace at the end of December in the Bay of Biscay were picked up by the Eireship Kerlogue and landed in Eire. They have been interned by the Eireauthorities.64. Two parachutists of Irish origin were dropped from German aircraft over Eire in the middle of December for espionage purposes. Both men were arrested at once and have been held in custody since. The first man, named0&apos;Reilly, was dropped from a German plane on the 16th December about 3 milesfrom his father&apos;s house at Kilkee, where he was arrested. Kenny, the second man,bailed out some three days later near the same place, but was severely injured inhis fall. 0&apos;Reilly left Ireland for this country before the outbreak of Avar andwas in Jersey when the Germans invaded the Channel Islands. Since then he. hasbeen broadcasting regularly on the German radio from Berlin.65. It was announced on the 19th January that Mr. Cosgrave, first Presidentof the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, has resigned from both the leadership and the Presidency of the Fine Gael party. This decision, which isthe result of ill-health, was announced after a prolonged meeting of members ofthe party, when Dr. 0&apos;Higgins was elected his successor as Leader of the partyin the Dail. Mr. Cosgrave does not for the moment intend to resign his seat inthe Dail.
66. His successor as President of the party is General Mulcahy, who was unanimously elected on Mr. Cosgrave&apos;s retirement. Outlining his party&apos;international policy after his election General Mulcahy declared &quot; foreign policy will be the framework inside of which our internal policies will be carried on andmay well have important effects on our economic well-being. We standunequivocally for membership of the British Commonwealth; we believe that thesolution of the problem of partition must be brought about by agreement betweenIrishmen; and that closer co-operation and consultation between ourselves andall classes of people in the North, including the Government there, will be urgently needed in the immediate future.&quot;67. The flour milling standard of extraction from wheat, which had been raised, on account of grain shortage, to the full 100 per cent., has now been brought down to the previous 85 per cent. It is stated that, as a result of the widespreadpractice of &quot; screening &quot; adopted by Eire housewives, the lower rate of extractionwill not, in fact, involve increased consumption of wheat.INDIA.Report by the Secretary of State for India.68. General, For the past month of January there is once again very little change to report in the internal situation. Public opinion remains optimisticwith regard to the course of the war, and interest in the Burma region has beenrevived by the local advances in Arakan and North Burma. The absence of anyreports of political or communal disturbances testifies to the general peacefulnessof the country. The political scene remains unchanged; demands continue to bemade from Hindu.quarters for the release of the Congress leaders and Mr. Gandhibut without any evidence that a political settlement would be facilitated thereby.69. On the 22nd January Mr. Casey assumed office as Governor of Bengal.On the same date the Government of India announced their intention to appoint a High Commissioner for India in Australia, in reciprocation of the decision bythe Commonwealth Government last autumn to appoint an Australian HighCommissioner in India.70. Indian States. In the report for last April reference was made to theintroduction of an important scheme in Western India for the attachment ofgroups of small States to larger States in order to remedy the administrative difficulties and confusion caused by the perpetuation as units of some 400 pettyStates. The initiation of the scheme has been adversely affected by the decision in December of a local court that in introducing it the Crown representative had acted beyond his powers as defined in the Government of India Act and inhis Letters Patent. The immediate local repercussions have been very unfortunatebut it remains the intention to proceed with the scheme. Parliamentary legisla-tion is being introduced to place beyond doubt the legality of the arrangementscontemplated.Foreign and Frontier Relations.71. Afghanistan. The Prime Minister continued to make satisfactory progress towards recovery from his illness. In his absence the King was reportedto be taking a greater interest in administration. Developments in the war situation, and in particular the Tehran Conference, did much to relieve Afghananxieties, but the Russian attitude over the Soviet-Polish frontier situationcoining so soon after the Tehran declaration came as a shock to the AfghanGovernment. Internally the situation remains satisfactory, though trouble was reported to be threatening again in the Southern Province.72. Both the Afghans and the Russians were much pleased at the successful conclusion of the negotiations for the purchase of Afghan wool, and expressedwarm appreciation of the patience and skill in negotiation of Mr. Dawkins, theU.K.C.C. representative.73. A welcome indication of the Afghan Governments desire for closer relations with His Majesty&apos;s Government was given by their request to HisMajesty&apos;s Minister that we should provide three English professors for theGhazi College, Kabul, to teach English, physics and chemistry. Hitherto theyhave steadily refused to consider any suggestion made to them of this kind. Thematter is being taken up with the British Council.
74. Less satisfactory has been the encouragement by the Afghan Governmentof the re-export on a considerable scale to Persia of commodities, such as tea andpiece-goods, which the Government of India have permitted to be exported from india to Afghanistan as a concession designed, to meet the internal needs of thecountry. Llis Majesty&apos;s Minister was instructed to convey an oral warning tothe Afghan Government in the matter. The arrival through Russia of a consign-ment of 2,000 tons of Java quinine was reported, presumably as the result of adeal with the Japanese.75. North-West Frontier. Generally the frontier situation remained unchanged, but in North Waziristan in the middle of the month there was somerenewed hostile activity and a hostile lashkar, under some of the Faqir of Ipi&apos;slieutenants, was reported to be preparing for action in the Kurram.76. Nepal. The Maharaja has given his oral agreement to the appointmentof Lieutenant-Colonel G. A. Falconer, who has been nominated to succeedLieutenant-Colonel G. Betham as His Majesty&apos;s Minister in April next. the maharaja said that he would not think of questioning His Majesty&apos;s choice, buthe was somewhat surprised that an officer of somewhat higher seniority had. notbeen selected.77. The Persian Gulf. The supply of cereals and dates to the Persian GulfSheikhdoms gave cause for some anxiety. Since the end of 1942 the supplyof cereals has been undertaken by the M.E.S.C. in place of India. At the endof last year stocks were for a time reduced,to a very low level, but the situationis now more satisfactory. As regards dates, v/hich all the States except Muscatare accustomed to import, great difficulty has been experienced in obtainingsufficient quantities from Basrah under the scheme worked out by the Ministryof Food, The Political Resident left for a visit to Cairo at the end of themonth to discuss his difficulties with Dr. Murrav, the Food Controller of theM.E.S.C.78. The strike among the Arab employees at the Bahrein Oil Refinery,which was referred to in last month&apos;s report, proved short-lived, though at onetime about 600 men were out At the beginning of January all the strikers had returned to work.Financial.79. Silver. After six months&apos; active negotiation the United states authorities have agreed in principle to lend India 100 million ounces of silver forsale, if necessary, on the market as an anti-inflationary measure. The exactconditions as to the period after the war within which the silver must be replaced,the limit of price below which the Government of India must not sell and theobligations, if any, to be assumed by His Majesty&apos;s Government in this connectionare still under discussion. The Americans are also using the fact that the supplyof this silver has been approved as one reason for delay in meeting the Governmentof Inda&apos;s separate request for silver for coinage purposes.Economic.80. Bengal Health situation. Cholera, although still serious, is declining.The death rate from this disease in December averaged 4,016 per week as against4,864 in November and 5,349 in October. For the first fortnight of January itdropped further to an average of 2,547 per week. Smallpox, on the other hand,is increasing and malaria, although improving in some districts, is still prevalent.There is great difficulty in obtaining doctors, subordinate public health staff and nurses and this has been increased, by the insistence of the Provincial Governmenton maintaining the normal communal ratio for recruitment. This shortage of. staff has resulted in the mass cholera inoculation campaign being very muchbehind schedule.81. Railway Locomotives. The position of the supply of locomotives forthe Indian Railways shows improvement. It would, however, be unsafe to say,so far as the broad-gauge locomotives position is concerned, that the crisis hasbeen passed. The enormously increased strain on broad-gauge engine power is such that it may be necessary to seek the provision, by the end of 1945, of at least a further 200 broad-gauge locomotives over and above the present supplyprogrammes.   This problem is being closely pursued.[27000] c
82. Railway Wagons-The wagon position is not so promising. Theproblem does not arise in respect of metre-gauge wagons. 12,000 of which arebeing supplied from America in 1944. It is the broad-gauge wagon position which gives cause for anxiety. India has been endeavouring to meet her require-ment of broad-gauge wagons from domestic production, which, however, is dependent to a considerable extent on the import of wagon components.Considerable quantities of wagon components are being supplied from Americaand this country, and negotiations are now being conducted in respect of largerequirements of components for India&apos;s 1945 wagon production programme. Thedifficulties encountered in releasing indigenous fabrication capacity and in securing a steady flow of deliveries of components have been such, however, thatthe Government of India recently telegraphed that their production during 1944will be 5,000 broad-gauge wagons short of their immediate requirements, and asked whether this number could be supplied from this country or United States.Enquiries are now proceeding.Naval, Military and Air Force Activities.83. Royal Indian Navy. II.M.I. Sloop Kistna sailed for Indian waters inDecember 1943.84. At the beginning of the month Japanese positions on Ramree Island offthe Burma coast, and 120 miles from the Indian Frontier, were bombarded byLight Coastal craft. The attack, which lasted about 20 minutes, was made by night and was a complete surprise. The Japanese Air Force attacked our force as it was returning to base the following morning. This attack was intercepted by the R.A.F. Out of 29 enemy aircraft, 13 were destroyed, 3 probably destroyed and 7 damaged.85. Military: Italy. The 8 Indian Division has been actively engagedthroughout the month on the 8th Army Front.86. Burma. The Japanese have continued to carry out small-scale counter-attacks West of the Mayu Ridge, all of which were repulsed. Our troops havemade slight advances south-east of Maungdaw and have captured positionscommanding the Maungdaw-Buthidaung Road. The advance down the KaladanValley has continued and Paletwa has been occupied. On the Chindwin frontKyaukchaw has been occupied. In a patrol action in this area with 60 Japanesethe latter suffered 25 casualties. Our casualties were 5. Chinese troops continueto make some progress in the Hukawng Valley.87. In North Burma several successful ambushes have been carried out byLevies assisted on occasion by Gurkhas. In one 40 Japanese moving Northtowards Sumprabum lost 15 killed and 10 wounded.88. Air. Flying was hampered by bad weather. R.A.F. medium bombersmainly attacked railway targets and also laid mines in the Rangoon Estuary.In the Arakan and Chin Hills areas direct support was continued to our troops and attacks were made on the enemy&apos;s Lines of Communication.89. U.S.A.A.F. successfully attacked oil installations at Yenangyaung,railway installations and the Mu River bridge. Troops in North Burma were also given support and fighter cover was maintained over the China air supplyroute.  Enemy activity was only on a small scale.90. General: Famine Relief. Over 38,000 tons of food grains have beendistributed by the Army, and over 225,000 miles have been covered by Armyvehicles. The distribution of clothing and blankets has increased, but is not yetadequate. Up to the end of December military hospitals and mobile treatmentcentres had dealt with 127,934 cases and had administered 67,700 cholerainoculations and 45,000 vaccinations. It cannot yet be said when troops onfamine relief duty can be withdrawn.91. Works Services and Transportation. Progress on all main projects is reasonably satisfactory, but shortages of transport and coal are still obstacles toany acceleration of effort. Important recommendations for the development ofthe port of Bombay are being implemented.92. Welfare. Important developments in welfare education of Britishtroops have been taking place. Text books are being imported and a roster of personnel with teaching experience is being compiled. Current affairs pamphletsfor British and Indian troops are now to be issued monthly, and preparations for the regular issue of A.B.C.A. map reviews are in hand.
93. Morale. This remains high, especially amongst forward troops. Tourscarried out by the Commander-in-Chief, India, the Supreme Allied Commander,South-East Asia, and the Adjutant-General, War Office, were welcomed and hadbeneficial results. British troops are still interested in repatriation and post-war reconstruction problems. There are no indications of any harmful effect on indian troops being caused by increased Japanese front line propaganda, while our anti-Japanese propaganda is widely reported to be doing good. west african troops in India are reported to be cheerful and friendly.BURMA.Report by the Secretary of State for Burma.94. Occupied Burma. There is a certain amount of information pointingto popular discontent with Japanese domination. Ba Maw has reintroduced theold Burmese system of communal (village and family) responsibility for crimes.95. A Central Bank of Burma which is to handle public finance and issuecurrency was formally opened on the 15th January with a capital of 10 millionrupees.  Two Japanese representatives are to advise the Burmese directors.96. Frontier Administration. The Supreme Allied Commander, S.E.A.C.,has issued a Proclamation assuming to himself with effect from the 1st Januaryall civil powers in such parts of Burma as are, or may be, occupied by his forces.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note, In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &quot; Colonial Governors &quot; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.East A frica.97. I reported last month that a further deterioration had occurred in thefood situation in East Africa as a result of which prospective import deficiencyhad been tentatively put at 145,000 tons, but that the East African authoritiesproposed to review the situation again in February before entering a firm demandfor their total requirements.98. Unfortunately, the deterioration in the situation has been confirmed bya further report received at the end of January, and the East African authoritieshave now had to enter a firm demand for a total import deficiency of 130,000 tons which is required by the end of June or at latest by July.N. Rhodesia.99. The Governor has reported a serious shortage of meat supplies as aresult of which it has been necessary to make an overall cut in meat supplies to both European and African consumers of one-quarter.Ceylon.100. The problem of providing future supplies of rice for Ceylon is nowcausing considerable anxiety. The Island requires an immediate import of10,000 tons- a month in order to maintain the existing ration scale, which represents only l/6th of the pre-war rice ration, the balance having to be made up in other cereals which are much less acceptable to the consumers. All adviceis to the effect that this very much reduced rice ration could not be still further reduced without immediate serious effects on production of rubber, tea, &amp;c.101.   Ceylon had been allocated from purchases which it was expected tomake from the current season&apos;s Egyptian rice crop, a total of 50,000 tons.   Thelatest reports show, however, that purchases will almost certainly be much lessthan was expected and Ceylon&apos;s allocation has in consequence itself had to be[27000] D
greatly reduced. Apart from Egypt, the only sources known from which Ceyloncould obtain rice are India and Brazil. The Government of India are unwilling to permit the export of any rice at all in view of the food situation in India.The Minister of War Transport, however, has agreed to see that shipping forCeylon&apos;s minimum import requirements of 10,000 tons of rice a month isprovided, either from Egypt or from Brazil.Mauritius.102. The maintenance of food supplies to Mauritius, particularly meat andedible oil, has continued to present difficulty mainly owing to the lack of localshipping. The Minister of War Transport has now agreed that the vessel referredto at the end of the paragraph on Mauritius food supplies in my report for November may be allocated to Mauritius for a limited period.Textile Supplies.Northern Rhodesia.103. The Financial Secretary of Northern Rhodesia, Mr Tucker, andDirector of Civil Supplies, Mr. McKee, have come to London on a flying visit todiscuss the possibility of improving the arrangements for maintaining supplies to northern Rhodesia especially of textiles. Owing to the fact that northern rhodesia normally obtains its imports of such goods through wholesale houses in southern Rhodesia, there are no wholesale stocks within the territory, and this has given rise to difficulties in the present time of short supplies. Discussions arebeing arranged between them and the supply authorities in this country.Northern Rhodesia Copper.104. The recently announced decision to effect some reduction in theproduction of copper in Northern Rhodesia is the result of the fact that united nations&apos; Copper stocks are now fully satisfactory in relation to demands, and thatif production were to be continued at previous levels, there would be created a veryserious stock problem at the end of the war.105. Some apprehension has been felt at the probable reception of the news of the cut, particularly among the European mine-workers of Northern Rhodesia,and indeed for the first few days after the announcement the situation was tensewith a possibility of strike action by the Europeans which would almost certainly have been followed by . strikes among the native workers. There are signs,however, that wiser counsels have prevailed and that a programme of consultation and discussion will be followed, but this situation is always liable to be altered at short notice on the copper belt, where tempers are apt to be short. The situation will not be made easier if it does not prove possible simultaneously to effect some reduction in His Majesty&apos;s Governments purchases of copper from the neigh-bouring Belgian Congo mining areas.Ceylon Copra.106. Ceylon sells all its copra and coconut oil to the Ministry of Food, anda substantial allocation is made out of this purchase to India. Hitherto, thisIndian allocation has been turned over by Ceylon at the Ministry of Food price, toa nominee of the Government of India, and Ceylon has had no share in the substantial profits made on the re-sale of this copra by that nominee. This hasconstituted a chronic grievance in Ceylon, but it has now been possible to arrange with the Government of India that Ceylon will be repaid the net surplusesarising in consequence of the re-sale of Ceylon copra in India.Defence.West Indies.107. December 1943 report, paragraph 91. The West Indian contingentwhich is to be moved to serve with the* Mediterranean Forces as soon as possible after April 1944 will be organised as one infantry battalion.108. July 1943 report, paragraph 81. The United States militaryauthorities have now removed all coloured troops from Trinidad. These troops had on several occasions disturbed public order in Port of Spain and the american authorities have for some time been pressed to remove them.
Mauritius.109. December 1943 report, paragraph 93. All ring-leaders of the mutinyat Diego Suarez have now been tried and their sentences promulgated. Over500 offenders have been dealt with summarily on minor charges. Variousreforms in the organisation of the Mauritius Regiment are now being carriedout and a proposal&quot; urged by the Governor, to remove one white Mauritian batteryout of Mauritius is being examined. The purpose of this proposal is to silenceunjustified local criticism to the effect that only coloured Mauritians are being-sent overseas while white Mauritian troops remain at home. It has beenagreed that the Governor may make a confidential statement on the whole incidentto his Council in order to anticipate leakage from other sources.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.110. There were no outstanding events in Arab politics. In Jewish affairsthe main political event was a five-day conference of the Mapai (Jewish LabourParty). Its avowed object was to secure a united front on the vital issuesfacing the Yishuv, but it was clear that a breakaway of the group opposed toMr. Ben Gurion was only narrowly averted by the postponement of a decisionto a later meeting.111. The selection of Mr. M. Shertok, Dr. E. Schmorak and Rabbi J. L.Eishman, all of the Jewish Agency Executive, to form the delegation (mentionedlast month) to meet Dr. Weizmann in London, was finally endorsed by the InnerZionist Council on the 28th December. Their discussion of the directive on policyconcluded with a reaffirmation of the Biltmore programme.112. Following the conviction and sentence of the Muktar and six membersof the Hulda Settlement Committee, mentioned in last month&apos;s report, the Mapaiof the Ffistadruth-controlled settlements held protest meetings and adoptedresolutions threatening to resign. It is considered, however, that these threatsare merely a symbolic gesture.113. Cases of armed banditry continued to occur, but police counter-measures were pursued energetically and public security, in general, was satisfactory.114.   Both Jewish and Arab recruiting was at the usual low level.115. There was no change in the cost of living index for December, which remained at 230. Supplies of many commodities, particularly meat, remainvery short. The new War Economic Advisory Council have been getting into their stride and their discussions have covered a wide field, including mostaspects of food control.   Substantial rains relieved anxiety over crop prospects.Kenya.116. Substantial assistance from the Colonial Development and WelfareVote has been approved towards meeting the cost of the development programme to which reference was made in the report for September 1943. Some scheme shave been approved outright, while others, with which progress cannot be made until men and materials are available, have been approved in principle.117. The latter include a scheme for African Urban housing, for which the kenya Government expect that  500,000 will be required as a first instalment;a soil conservation scheme, for which approximately  439,000 will probably bemet from the Colonial Development and Welfare Vote over a 6-year period; and various schemes for improving water supplies, both in the European and African areas.Fiji.Sugar Dispute.118. The Governor reported on the 11th January that there wereunmistakable evidences of a general anxiety on the farmers&apos; part to resumeplanting, and of a last-minute rush to get cane to the mills. Extremist leaders have indicated in secret negotiations that they are prepared to give way on allmajor issues provided that they can publicly announce (as a means of saving faceand living to fight another day) that they have established the growers&apos; claimto &quot; a fair price,&quot; and that the Government would be the guarantor of that price.
119. The Fiji Government have refused to accept this solution, as it wouldmislead farmers into the erroneous belief that in consequence of Government inter-vention the existing cane agreement with the Company has been terminated.120. Resentment against the extremist leaders is rising, and some Indianshave even petitioned the Government to act on the suggestion made in theLegislative Council that strike leaders not born in the Colony should be deported.121. Meanwhile, negotiations between the Secretary of State and theCompany&apos;s representative in London continue.West Indies.West Indian Conference.122. The setting up of a regular system of Anglo-United States west indian Conferences was announced on the 5th January. These Conferences willbe inaugurated under the auspices of the Anglo-American Caribbean Commissionto discuss matters of common interest and especially of social and economicsignificance to Caribbean countries. Each British and United States territory in the area will be entitled to send two delegates and in the British Colonies oneof these will normally be an unofficial. Representation will be confined to theBritish and American countries at present, but there is provision for othercountries being invited to participate.123. The Conferences will be purely advisory and will have no executive powers unless these are specifically entrusted to it by the Governments of territories and Colonies which participate. It is proposed that the firstConference should be convened at Barbados in the second half of March.Higher Education.124. The Commission on Higher Education in the Colonies have with myapproval appointed a Committee of their members to visit the West Indies and consider the problem of higher education in that area On the spot. Sir JamesIrvine, Vice-Chancellor, St. Andrews University, will be Chairman of theCommittee and two West Indians have been appointed full members.A aviation.British West Indian Airways.125. Mr. Yerex left Trinidad on the 6th January without any decision being reached on the questions at issue between him and the Board of Directors of theCompany. He assured the Governor that he would do his utmost to reach agreement on his return.Education.126. A Report by the Advisory Committee on Education in the Colonies,on the subject of &quot; Mass Education in African Society,&quot; was published on the12th January and received a good reception and considerable prominence in thePress. I have sent copies of the Report to the African Governments andwarmly commended it to them for their consideration.
