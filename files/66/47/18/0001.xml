THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET. . . Copy No.W.P. (44) 118.19th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.Committee on Indian Food Grain Requirements.REPORT.THE War Cabinet at their meeting on the 17th February, 1944 (W.M. (44)22nd Conclusions, Minute 1), instructed the Committee on Indian Food GrainRequirements to consider telegram No. 332-S from the Viceroy to the Secretaryof State for India on the Indian food situation, and to submit a report for their consideration on Monday, the 21st February.2. The Committee met on the 18th February. They are impressed by theinsistence with which the Viceroy urges the case for some further degree ofassistance to the Indian food-grains position. It is clear to them, however, thatthe essential difficulty in this matter is the provision of the requisite shipping,and that this holds good whether the requisite tonnage is found by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment or whether one of the Viceroy&apos;s alternative suggestions is pursued,namely, that a minimum of 500,000 tons should be obtained from the UnitedStates over the next 6 months or that India should directly approach U.N.R.R.A.3. They were informed by the Minister of War Transport that, so far ashe could judge, it would be out of the question to make shipping available on thescale necessary for imports of the order desired by the Viceroy, since shippingcould be made available in fact, only at the cost of (a) a further serious inroadinto the British import programme, or (&amp;) an interference with operational plans.4: The Minister of War Transport indicated his readiness to assist in thefinal consideration of this problem by analysing the effect on United kingdom imports of the diversion of shipping that would be necessary, and. to see that this analysis would be made available to those responsible for the respective aspects.5. The Committee, impressed as they are by the importance of giving somesupplementary assistance if possible to the Government of India, even ifassistance on the scale desired by the Viceroy should not be practicable, have considered alternative methods of securing this. They are of opinion that theonly way of continuing assistance lies in a further diversion to India of shipments of food grains destined for the Balkan stock pile in the Middle East; this might amount to 50,000 tons. The Committee realise that this is a matter which mustbe left for consideration by the War Cabinet, in the light of earlier cabinet conclusions on this subject, and that United States reactions to the proposal would have to be ascertained.6. They also think that there would be advantage if ships carrying military or civil cargo from Australia and the United States to India could also take a quantity of bagged wheat, having regard to the psychological effect of theunloading of bagged wheat from such cargoes at the various ports.7. The Committee endorse the suggestion of the Paymaster-General thatthe Viceroy should be invited to consider to what extent skilful publicity can beused to magnify the effect of such supplies of food grains including barley as canbe made available.8. They recommend that the. Government of India should be asked to givethe fullest consideration to the utilisation to the utmost advantage of such supplies of barley as will be made available from Iraq.[26960]
29. Consideration was given to the Viceroy&apos;s proposal to make an appealto U.N.R.R.A. It was agreed that the policy of.His Majesty&apos;s Government hashitherto been that the British Empire should not come within the sphere of u.N.R.R.A. activities. Moreover, since U.N.R.R.A. is not in a position toprovide shipping, such an appeal could only be useful or otherwise by its indirecteffect.10. The Chairman stated that any diversion of shipping from operationalpurposes did not lie within the competence of the Committee, but it was clearthat that possibility must be considered elsewhere.11. The India Office, while welcoming any continuation of shipments of grain to India on whatever scale, feel it necessary to emphasise that the above proposals can only go a small way towards meeting the urgent requests of theViceroy and of the Government of India.(Signed on behalf of the Committee),R. A. B.India Office, S.W. 1,19th February, 1944.
