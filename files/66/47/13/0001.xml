THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet,  February 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 113.17th February, 1944.FOOD PROBLEMS LIKELY TO ARISE IN LIBERATED EUROPE.Memorandum by the Minister of Economic Warfare.IN my memorandum, W.P. (43) 401, I called attention to the serious food situation that would arise in Europe on the collapse of German resistance. TheCabinet decided* that in our propaganda we should cease advising occupied countries to destroy crops and not to sow corn, and that the question of whether our propaganda should actually encourage food production in Europe should bere considered before the Spring sowings. That time has now come, as any propa-ganda on the Spring sowings must start before the end of February.2. Since my previous memorandum the world food situation has shown no improvement. Indeed, in certain respects (e.g., cereals) the position has deteriorated. The latest information suggests that supplies will be totally inadequate to meet the demands of the Allied Governments, excluding Russianrequirements. When Russian requirements are added, the deficit will be veryserious indeed.3. While the enemy may resist for a long time, and even after the 1944harvest has been reaped over the greater part of Europe, the amount of food he might actually obtain from it would be determined chiefly by the degree of localresistance to collection. Moreover, in view of Germany&apos;s relatively smalldependence upon imports from other European countries, the loss or gain to theenemy*s own supplies, which propaganda might achieve, could not be reckoneda strategic factor of importance.4. The risk of potential benefit to the enemy would therefore seem to beoutweighed by the greater likelihood of embarrassment to the armies of liberation by semi-famine conditions and by considerations of future world-supply.5. I therefore suggest that our propaganda should now encourage Springsowings while continuing to urge peasants not to market their food through Nazi-controlled channels.S.Ministry of Economic Warfare,17th February, 1944.* W.M.
