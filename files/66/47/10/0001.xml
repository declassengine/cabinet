THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 110.15th February, 1944.     -   - WAK  CABINET.HOUSING IN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.THE problem of housing in &quot;the transition period &quot; will be to meet the urgent needs of those who have no homes of their own; and for this immediatepurpose well over half a million new homes will be needed.This need cannot be fully met by new houses of normal construction becausethe labour will not be available. We shall have to undertake a substantial amountof emergency housing, by adapting existing buildings and&quot;b3&apos; providing temporary accommodation of various-kinds. Much progress has been made in planningtemporary expedients of this kind.At the same time we must be ready -to make an early start with theconstruction of new houses of a permanent type, widely spread throughout theareas where the need is greatest. For this purpose we must look primarily to thelocal authorities who already have the statutory powers and duties, theorganisation for house-building and, to a large extent, the land required for this first instalment of the housing programme. In Scotland their work can be supplemented by the Scottish Special Housing Association.The Reconstruction Committee have, therefore, been considering what measures are required to enable local authorities to make an early start, as soonas conditions permit, with the construction of new houses of permanent type.This memorandum is concerned only with the measures required for that purpose.It does not purport to deal either with the supplementary programme of emergencyhousing or with the construction of houses by private enterprise.2. We have not as yet all the data required for a firm estimate of the total volume of house-building which it will be practicable to undertake in the transitional period. It is, however, clear that the total number of new housescompleted or in course of construction by the end of the first two years after theend of war with Germany cannot exceed 300,000 over Great Britain as a whole 100,000 by the end of the first year, and 200,000 by the end of the second year(including in Scotland 20,000 in the first year and 30,000 in the second). Thesefigures &quot;make allowance for the new houses likely to be built by private owners,with the assistance of the War Damage Commission, in replacement of housescompletely destroyed by enemy action; but it is assumed that during this periodvirtually all other house-building will be undertaken by public authorities.3. We therefore recommend that the Minister of Flealth and the Secretary ofState for Scotland should now be authorised to urge local authorities to make allpreliminary preparations and plans to ensure that, if the war in Europe were over by the end of 1944, they could make an immediate start on a two-year programme of this magnitude.These discussions with the local authorities should proceed on the following basis : The total volume of house-building in this period will necessarily dependon the labour available, and this cannot yet be estimated with precision. we ought, however, to have our plans ready, and all the preliminary preparationsmade, to ensure that, if building resources permit, we could have completed, orunder construction, a maximum of 100,000 houses by the end of 1945 and a further200,000 by the end of 1946. This total of 300,000 contains an allowance for about 40,000 in replacement of houses completely destroyed by enemy action.  The[26935]&quot;fI Copy No.
local authorities throughout Great Britain should, however, be ready to undertake,if sufficient labour can be made available, the whole of the balance of this programme-for the first two years.4. The statutory powers of local authorities are wide enough to enable themto undertake this programme; but by the Housing Acts of 1938 Exchequerassistance is limited broadly to houses required for slum clearance, for the abatement of overcrowding and for agricultural workers.We therefore recommend the early introduction of legislation to provide thatduring this two-year period Exchequer assistance may also be made available for houses built by local authorities, with the approval of the Health Ministers, forthe general needs of the working classes.Housing subsidy is normally reviewed at intervals of three years; and, onthe assumption that the proposed Bill will become law by the end of the summer of 1944, it will be convenient that the period of the extended subsidy should be expressed as three years from the passing of the Bill. (Alternatively, the bill could provide that the extended subsidy should be available for two years fromian appointed day, and the Government could announce their intention to bring this provision into operation at the end of the war with Germany.)5. We consider that the basis and ratio of the Exchequer subsidy shouldbe broadly as in existing legislation i.e., an Exchequer contribution of a fixedamount in respect of houses of all sizes built and administered by looalauthorities, and a ratio of  2 from the Exchequer to  1 from the rates, subjectto special arrangements for exceptional cases. In Scotland, because, amongst other things, of the need for stouter building to meet the rigours of climate, the ratio is slightl^higher and should be maintained.The actual amount of the subsidy to be paid during the first two years afterthe war with Germany will have to be reviewed in the light of changes in thelevel of building costs and rents; and further legislation will be required if it isfound necessary to increase the amount fixed by existing legislation. We think,however, that it would be preferable and the local authorities may share thisview that the fixing of the actual amount of the subsidy should be postponed until a better estimate can be made of the cost of building during this period.We suggest that the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State should discussthe matter on this basis with the representatives of the local authorities; andthat they should be authorised to give an assurance that, if this course is adopted and subsidy at the existing rates is paid at the outset, the Government will propose to Parliament that any increased rates subsequently determined shouldbe paid retrospectively in respect of houses approved under these arrangements.6.   Certain other measures must be taken to enable local authorities to makea prompt start with building operations as soon as conditions permit.(a) Land. Local authorities throughout Great Britain already possess sites .for about 135,000 houses.   Most of these were acquired before the war; and in1939 sanction for the purchase of further sites was withheld, as part of thefeneral Government policy of restricting capital expenditure. This restriction as since been relaxed to the extent of allowing local authorities to buy such additional sites as are required for a first year&apos;s programme. It is, however,uneconomical to buy land in small parcels; and at this stage of the war themaintenance of a restrictive attitude on the purchase of land by local authorities is likely to give the impression that the Government are half-hearted about theirpost-war housing programme. We therefore recommend that these restrictions should now be removed.The need for ensuring that new sites selected by local authorities are properlychosen will be met by co-operation with the Planning authority.Where necessary, special arrangements should be made, in consultation withthe Agricultural Departments, to enable local authorities to get possession, when required for building, of sites now under cultivation.(b) Compulsory purchase. The procedure for the compulsory acquisitionof land by local authorities is cumbrous. The Uthwatt Committee made recom-mendations for its improvement; but it may be some time before permanent legislation can be passed on this subject. In order to expedite the procedure for the purpose of houses to be built during the two years after the end of thewar in Europe, we recommend that temporary legislation should be introducedgiving the Health Ministers power during a period of two years to confirmopposed compulsory purchase orders without holding a public enquiry. (Asimilar temporary power was obtained at the end of the last war.)
(c) Prices. The Uthwatt Committee recommended that land required by public authorities should be bought at prices not exceeding those ruling at the31st March, 1939. This recommendation has been accepted by the Government,and it is the present policy not to sanction the purchase of land for housingpurposes at prices above the 1939 ceiling.There may be some cases in which local authorities will not be able to acquirenew sites needed for this programme until they have statutory powers to purchasecompulsorily at 1939 prices. It is, therefore, important that legislative effect should be given as soon as possible to this part of the Uthwatt Committee&apos;srecommendations, and the Reconstruction Committee is engaged on the formula-tion of proposals to deal with this.(d) Advance preparation of sites. While it will probably be impracticable to start building houses before the end of the war with Germany, an opportunity haspresented itself of constructing the roads, sewers, &amp;c, on some of the largersites already acquired for the early stages of the post-war housing programme.The Reconstruction Committee have approved a scheme for taking in hand this advance preparation of housing sites by using the organised labour and plantof a number of large contractors who will shortly complete their work on theprogramme of airfield construction.. By carrying out this preliminary workin advance, we shall ensure that the building labour, when it becomes available,can be employed at once in the construction of the houses.7. It is, of course, of vital importance that local authorities should be givenproper guidance regarding the type of house to be built. Reports on standards and design will be available very soon; and the Reconstruction Committee hope to be able, within the next few weeks, to formulate their recommendations to theWar Cabinet on these questions. Local authorities can, therefore, be assured that guidance on this matter will be made available very soon.Meanwhile, I ask, with the approval of the Reconstruction Committee, thatthe War Cabinet should authorise the Minister of Health and the Secretary ofState for Scotland (a) to open discussions with representatives of the localauthorities on the basis indicated in paragraphs 3 to 6 of this memorandum;and (b) to arrange for the early introduction of the legislation mentioned inparagraphs 4 and 6 (b) of this memorandum.W., nicnmona i err ace, o.
