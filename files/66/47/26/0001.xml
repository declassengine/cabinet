Cp &amp;ftvr^......THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENTSECRET 77W.P.   (kk)  126 COPY NO. . ****lgth February, 19kh.WAR CABINETOIL CONFERSNCb/iTH THE U.S.A.Memorandum by the First Lord of theAdmiralty.I have seen the paper prepared by the Lord privy Seal(W.P.  (kk) 102) and recent Foreign Office telegrams,  and in case it should, be decided to hold discussions with the Americansconcerning oil in the Middle East I wish to point out the special interest which the Admiralty has in these discussions.2. The general strategic importance of our oil concessions in &quot;the Middle East to the Commonwealth and Empire is too obviousto require emphasis,  and it is for this reason that the Admiraltywish to be assured that in the discussions there will be nocompromising on the following points3. There will,  I hope, be no question whatever of trans-ferring concession rights to the Americans.      After the last warprovision was made for the admission of American interests into theMiddle East oilfields, and it was hoped that this provision would settle the extent of American competition for concessions.Unfortunately, however, by a piece of chicanery,  an Americancompany was successful in obtaining the. concessions in Bahrein andEl Hasa outside the agreed arrangements.      The Americans now holdextensive concessions in the Middle East, and in view of theirlarge holdings in other parts of the world, have no justification for asking us to part with any of our concessions in their favour.k. I hope, also that there will be no weakening of thespecial rights we have obtained in connection with some of the concessions.    It has been our policy, whenever possible, to insist that concessions granted to any company in territories under British/influence.....

F1QAdmiralty,  S.W.1.19th February, 19ij4.influence should include the following conditions  t-(i) that the exploiting company should Toe a british company with a specified proportion of British .directors;(ii) that the senior staff employed should,  as far aspossible, he British;(iii) that a local, refinery should be established capableof producing oil fuel to Admiralty specification;(iv) that His Majesty&apos;s Government should have a rightof pre-emption in time of war or emergency.These conditions have been inserted chiefly for the purpose of safeguarding our military interests, particularly those of theAdmiralty,      I consider it important that nothing should be done at the Oil Conference which would in any way weaken the specialrights which we have under these clauses,  and,   in particular,  therights of pre-emption such as we obtained at Koweit and Quatar..5. I appreciate that the new pipeline proposed by the americans,  which will link the head of the Persian Gulf with theEastern Mediterranean, may bring strategic and commercial advantages.I should, however, be strongly oxoposed to bartering away any.- of ourconcessions or our special rights under paragraph k above,  to obtaincommon carrier privileges on the pipeline.6. Doubtless,  if the oil discussions take place,  other points affecting the Admiralty&apos;s interests will be ventilated,  andI hope that we shall be fully consulted at all stages,  if not actually associated with the discussions.A.V.A.
