THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1944.SECRET.Copy No. ej \y87W.P. (44) 129.23rd February, 1944.WAR CABINET.(The Washington Conversations.AN ALTERNATIVE POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.IN his memorandum W.P. (44) 81 the Minister of State admits that &quot; on acool calculation of the probabilities&quot; American acceptance of the schemesworked out in the Washington discussions is unlikely. Whatever the merits ofthe policy so far endorsed by the War Cabinet, there is, therefore, an obviousjustification for considering an alternative course. In the present paper the attempt is made to suggest the main economic principles on which such analternative policy should be based, as well as to indicate some of the specificmethods by which it can be carried out. But before doing this it may be worthwhile considering for a moment the principles and assumptions on which theWashington scheme is based.The policy advocated by the Minister of State is described by him as &quot;apolicy of expansionism and the removal of impediments to trade.&quot; The assump-tion throughout is that these two things are identical and that the minimum oftrade &quot;barriers&quot; involves the maximum of expansion. For this assumptionthere is not the slightest warrant in fact. The most conspicuous examples of expansion in our time have been the United States and Russia. In each case thatexpansion could not have taken place but for the effective insulation of thesecountries from outside economic competition. Nor is there any justification forsuggesting that this expansion has been at the expense of world prosperity. Ithas been new wealth created by concentration of effort on the human and material sources of a particular area. The fact is that international trade and expansionare not synonymous terms. External trade may be an essential element in an expanding national production, providing always that it is so controlled as tomake its effective contribution to the proper balance of that production.Uncontrolled promiscuous external trade is just as likely as not to be prejudicial to the healthy and stable expansion not only of individual nations, but of theworld as a whole.Still less warranted is the assumption that uncontrolled &quot; automatic&quot;international trade can secure the one great desideratum of our time, namely,stability of employment. Everybody nowadays is ready to admit that some measure of national control of investment and expenditure in the internal economic field is desirable in order to correct the fluctuations of the &apos;&apos; tradecycle.&quot; It is at least as necessary in the external field. We have only to go back to the disastrous consequences between the two wars of the adoption ofsubstantially the same policy as that on which the present proposals are based.Sir Hubert Henderson in his memorandum W.P. (44) 41 has shown conclusivelythe topsy-turvyness of the legend that the world depression of 1930 was causedby tariffs, quotas, exchange restrictions, &amp;c. It was the misguided re-establish-ment of the old laisser faire international economy with its automatic goldstandard, its free international investment and its Most-Favoured-Nation clausewhich converted an American speculative slump into a world deflationarydepression. From that disaster the nations saved themselves as best they couldby their quotas and restrictions. We were able to get off more easily by jettison-ing the gold standard and by our freedom to make mutually beneficial trade agreements within the Empire unhampered by the Most-Favoured-Nation clause.To say that these remedial measures caused the depression is on a par with blamingthe umbrellas in the street for causing the rain.To these sJjpshod,.asjuni^igns as to what is best for the world at large, theMinister of Staf^aws&apos;&quot; certain others affecting our own particular national interest.   The first is that the only thing that matters is the expansion of our[26978]
export trade. But our export trade is not an end in itself. It is the means for securing those imports of food-stuffs and raw materials which are essentialto the balancing of our economic system. A policy which deprives us of fulland effective selective control of our imports means that a large part of our exports will be wasted in paying for imports that are unnecessary or evenprejudicial to the stability and expansion of our industries. We may havebeen able to afford that extravagance in the past. We shall be very far indeedfrom being able to afford it in future. It is only by the most drastic selectivecontrol of our imports that we can ever hope in the present generation to pay our way bv our exports.There is the further assumption that all that is required to secure themaximum expansion of our export trade is that we should compete on equal terms with all our competitors in a low tariff world. That assumption is a good fifty years out of date. Over the greater part of the field of industrial production wehave for a long time past, and in ever! increasing degree, ceased to be able to holdour own on sheer price competitive terms with foreign industries based on cheaper-labour or a vastly larger scale of production. One indication of that change is thefact that between 1901 and 1937 our exports to British countries, in most of whichwe have enjoyed some measure of preference, for that period, went up from 32-5of our total exports to 48 - 3 (and to over 50 per cent, of our manufactured exports).In actual volume our exports to the Empire more than doubled (from 113-2 to251-9 million pounds.) while those to foreign countries increased by less than12 per cent, (from 234-7 to 289-5 million pounds).This expansion of our Empire exports took place in spite of the tremendousshrinkage of our cotton exports to India, due in part to the protection of theIndian industry, but also to Japanese competition which would have been evenworse but for a certain modicum of preference we have enjoyed, under the Indiantariff since Ottawa. In our African colonies we have only been able to keep ourend up against Japanese competition by. the sheer brutal imposition of quota restrictions. Again in all our most recent trade agreements the really worthwhile part has been, not the reduction of duties which we may have secured, butthe specific quota and barter arrangements by which we have defeated the most favoured Nation clause. The value of our Treaty with Denmark, which formed the model for a number of others, lay almost entirely in the quantitative bilateralarrangements by which we successfully circumvented the Germans whom we couldnot beat in open price competition. It is not only Imperial Preference, butcolonial quotas and. treaties of the Danish type that we should have to jettisonif we are to be committed to the Washington proposals. Whatever the general level of world tariffs, I cannot conceive that those exports in which we can holdour own in open international competition can ever again in our generation evenremotely approximate to the total required to meet our minimum balance of pay-ments. It is only by the fullest use of the bargaining power of our splendidconsumers&apos; market, whether within the Empire or with foreign countries, in orderto secure special terms for ourselves, as well as by the firm control of our imports,that we can possibly hope to survive.This brings me to the last and not least dangerous principle upon which theseproposals are based. And that is that in a period of exceptional stress and difficulty in the world, a period of economic as well as political revolution, weshould abdicate all control over our national and imperial economic life, whether directly exercised or secured by special agreements, in favour of mechanical&quot; automatic &quot; schemes by which we are to be tied hand and foot, subject onlyto some slight permissive concessions to be adjudicated, in the light of &quot;objective&quot;standards, by international committees on which we shall always be a minority.I do not believe that we really wish ourselves or the British Empire to be solddown the river &quot; in that fashion.That leads on to the first principle that I would lay down for any alternative policy, namely, that we should retain full control over our external trade and ourmonetary and investment policy in the interests of our own economic prosperityand stability and, so far as we can, that of the British Empire and commonwealth as a whole. We must be free to take whatever measures we think necessary to safe-guard our own production, to develop Imperial Preference, to use our bargaining power with foreign countries, and to strengthen that wonderful monetaryinstrument the sterling system. We must enter into no internatipnal^qmmi^mejitswhich in any way limit that freedom. - &quot;&apos;&quot;&quot;The next principle I would lay down is that we mustinake iull^s^i^^^theland of this country intrinsically one of the richest in tne world.  We nuastdo&quot;&quot;^^n^sr^r&quot;s^&apos;\^or&amp;Q,r to create a better balanced national life, both irom theeconomic and social point of view.   Secondly, to build up a new home market for
our industries, Thirdly, tg ease the strain on our balance of payments by cuttingout all imports of agricultural produce that can be covered by domestic production.The third principle should be to retammir home,rnaKketin,lhe main for ourown industries in order to conserve exchange, fcTstabilise employment and to afford a secure basis for the export trade. This need not conflict with such limitedadmission of foreign manufactures as may result from specific negotiations orserve to stimulate efficiency.These main ends can be achieved by various alternative methods. In thecase of agriculture it will be necessary, on the one hand, to secure to the farmers return that will adequately cover his permanent charges for the- maintenanceof his land and equipment in good condition, as well as his current costs, and,on the other hand, to keep down prices to the consumer at a reasonable level.This can be done by bulk purchase of imports by a State agency, the profits onthe purchase price being utilised to subsidise the home producer. It can be equallywell done on individualist lines by the method of levy-subsidy. It can be doneby quantitative limitation whether with or without the imposition of a duty.All these methods might, indeed, be used concurrently according to theparticular product concerned. State purchase is most easily applied to staplearticles imported in large volume like wheat, maize, meat, dairy produce, cattlefood and fertilisers. Quantitative restriction has the advantage of securingdefinite figures to which the home producer can work, though this object can alsobe secured with very fair accuracy by a duty combined with a subsidy taperingoff, as in the Wheat Act, after a prescribed volume of production is attained.Quantitative limitation is essential as a provision against a glut resulting in aprice fall which no ordinary duty can cope with. On the other hand, it involvesfor the individual the necessity of applying for a licence and tends to favourvested importing interests. The method that interferes least with individualfreedom and enterprise, while incidentally also providing a useful revenuecontributed in varying degree by the foreign producer, is the simple duty,preferably specific rather than ad valorem. Over a great part of the field of miscellaneous production, it is obviously the simplest method to apply, whatever may be decided as regards the great staple products.Similarly, in the field of industry, State purchase can be most easily applied in the case of staple raw materials or semi-manufactures like oil and pig-iron.Over the infinitely varied range of fully-manufactured imports the necessity for allowing the maximum freedom to the individual purchaser to meet his special requierements, while at the same time effectively limiting the total volume of such imports, makes the tariff the only appropriate method, so long at any rate asproductive industry is carried on by individual enterprise.In the export field here again short of complete socialisation the detailedtask of developing our trade will presumably be left to individual firms or to export agencies acting on behalf of specific industries or of all British exportsto particular markets. The task of the State will lie mainly in the promotion of research, in the services of its foreign representatives and, above all, in the negotiation of trade agreements. That task is enormously facilitated withinthe Empire by the fact that we are not hampered by the Most-Favoured-nation clause. The concessions we give each other have a definite value for valuereceived and are not merely a right of admission to jostle with others in a queue.In negotiating with foreign countries we have hitherto only secured good valueby circumventing the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, whether by highly elaborateclassification or more crudely by quota and barter. It should be our objectiveto get rid of the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause, either altogether or byannouncing that in future it will only apply to our &quot; general&quot; or maximum tariff,and not to such specific concessions as we may give as the outcome of bilateral negotiations.An essential element both in our internal and external economic policy is thecontrol of our own monetary and investment policy. In dealing with monetary policy the Minister of State&apos;s memorandum lays all its stress on exchange parityand. makes much of the dangers of competitive depreciation. This seems to me aserious error in perspective. There is no real advantage on balance in depreciatingone&apos;s currency unless it is overvalued and unless the depreciation is necessary to counteract deflation. In any case the important thing to aim at is not exchangeparity but stability of the price level. The absence of the former is a mere incon-venience. Violent changes in the price level can have immeasurable social andpolitical as well as economic consequences.We have developed in sterling a monetary system which not only gives uscontrol over our own price level but which has created such confidence as to betreated as the anchorage and even as the actual basis of the local currency systems

In dealing with monetary policy the Minister of State&apos;s memorandum lays all its stress on exchange parityand makes much of the dangers of competitive depreciation. This seems to me aserious error in perspective. There is no real advantage on balance in depreciatingone&apos;s currency unless it is overvalued and unless the depreciation is necessary to counteract deflation. In any case the important thing to aim at is not exchangeparity but stability of the price level. The absence of the former is a mere incon-venience. Violent changes in the price level can have immeasurable social andpolitical as well as economic consequences.We have developed in sterling a monetary system which, not only gives uscontrol over our own price level but which has created such confidence as to betreated as the anchorage and even as the actual basis of the local currency systems
of most of the British Empire, and of many other countries as well. In this way we have secured parity of exchange over a vast area without sacrificing our owncontrol. What is more, we have paid our way during the present war on a giganticscale without involving ourselves in debt in other currencies as we did in the last war. By the time this war is over the countries of the sterling area will be holdinganything from  3,000 million to  4,000 million of sterling credits and securities.These will in large part remain locked up in the reserve of their currencies orcirculate among them in the course of mutual trade. In so far as they may be utilised after the war to purchase capital goods from this country they will atany rate act as a measure of preference and prime the pump for our more per-manent export trade. It is only in so far as there is a danger of their being thrown on the outside market and depreciating the value of sterling that they constitute a real danger. That danger would be enormously enhanced, as the Bank ofEngland memorandum indicates, by the creation of a new monetary union inwhich the several countries of the sterling area would cease to regard sterling any longer as the real unit and basis of value. The policy recommended by the Bank,namely,, that of building up and strengthening the sterling system, provisionallyestablishing parity with the dollar at some such reasonable figure as 4 dollars tothe pound, but retaining our full freedom to change the rate if our circumstancesrequire it, is clearly the right one.So, too, in regard to investment. Investment policy must be regarded as awhole from the point of view of expansion and of stability of employment whether in the domestic or in the external field. To divide it into a domestic investmentpolicy under national control and an external investment policy conducted by aninternational body, cannot be reconciled with any systematic policy of domesticor Empire development and can only lead to confusion and misunderstanding.To sum up. I would, lay down the following main principles of an economic policy which I believe to be sound in itself and calculated to make the best contri-bution to our own welfare, to that of the Empire and of the world.1. The building up of a balanced economic life in this country by therestoration of agriculture and by the fullest development of all our resources.2. The effective and unfettered selective control of our imports to contribute to that object.3. The fullest possible development of Imperial Preference regarded, notonly as the most fruitful source of an export trade capable of continous expansion, but also as the foundation of Imperial defence.4. The negotiation of specific trade agreements with foreign countries basedon the effective elimination of the Most-Favoured-Nation Clause.5. The fullest development of the monetary system of the sterling area.6. The full control of investment in the interest of national and Imperialexpansion and stability.The detailed methods by which these principles are to be applied in practicemay well be matters for discussion and difference. Socialists will apply themwith a bias towards directly State-controlled machinery. Conservatives witha bias towards indirect control through fiscal policy. These are matters that can be settled as we go along and can be varied without injury to our general purpose. What is important is that now, during the life-time of a coalition government, we should agree upon the main principles. The full working outof these principles may well take two or three generations and may be left tothe political trends of the day and to the development of our economic environ-ment.    What is needed now is to set the.course Avith a definite goal in view.So far as the American reaction is concerned, the policy I have put forwardwill not commend itself to Mr. Cordell Hull or Mr. Wallace. But there is noreason why American opinion generally should object to our looking after ourown interests, and to talk of a &quot; declaration of war &quot; in this context seems tome frankly ridiculous. - I should be much more afraid of the outburst of anti-American feeling that would inevitably be aroused in this country if it became known that we had committed ourselves to restricting our economic independence and had gone back on Imperial Preference in order to please the State Depart-ment. In practice, the chief result would be that American capital would seize the opportunity of getting in here or in the Dominions in order to secure ashare in our expansion. We should, in fact, get the American help we needwithout begging for it.L. S. A.India Office, 23rd February, 1944.
