THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1944.WAR CABINET.OIL.UNITED STATES AND MIDDLE EAST.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.THE United States Administration is asking for a Conference on middle eastern oil.  This request should be put in a pigeon hole.Public opinion in America is claiming that we should divide our oil resourceswith the United States. At any Conference, pressure will be brought to bear onto us to agree to this proposal. We should therefore delay the issue until the waris over.The basis of this American claim is the belief that the United States oilreserves have been depleted for our benefit. It is said that American interests have been providing a disproportionate share of the oil needed for the war effort,and that American oil reserves are down to 14 years&apos; expectancy.But this is not so. The Americans complained to me in 1941 that britain was deriving too much oil from British sources. And the same complaint wasmade to Lord Leathers in 1942.Before the war, between 60 and 70 per cent, of the world&apos;s oil consumption was taken from American sources in the United States. The oil-fields in theUnited States supply similar quantities to-day. American oil reserves wouldhave been just as much depleted if peace had prevailed.The calculation of 14 years&apos; expectancy for American oil reserves leavesout of consideration altogether the vast American interests in the oil depositsof the Caribbean area and of the Middle East.Oil is the greatest single post-war asset remaining to us. We should refuseto divide our last asset with the Americans. ^B.SECEET. Copy No.   35W.P.(M)102. /11th February, 1944.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S. W. 1,11th February, 1944.[26919]
