THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET. Copy No. ^ r&apos;\W.P. (44) 106.loth February, 1944.WAR CABINET.RE-ALLOCATION OF MAN-POWER POSITION OF THE colonial service.Note by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN the absence of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, I have been askedto place the attached Colonial Office memorandum before my colleagues.&apos; - C.Dominions Office,15th February, 1944.Memorandum by the Colonial Office.The Colonial Office has a particular interest in the question of re-allocation of man-power during the transition period. During the course of the war thesupply of man-power in the Colonial Service has been progressively weakenedin relation to the tasks imposed on the Service until the stage has now beenreached in which it is no exaggeration to say that many Colonial Administrationsare on the verge of a serious breakdown. In the Colonies there are no adequatelocal reserves on which to draw so as to supplement temporarily the regularService. Nor is it just a&quot;question of maintaining the pre-war level of services,but of planning and executing new developments in accordance with the forwardpolicy which His Majesty&apos;S&apos; Government have adopted for the Colonial Empire.There-is also the special problem of the reoccupation and rehabilitation of theFar Eastern territories over-run by Japan.2. The restricted recruitment into the Colonial Service during the war hasbeen quite insufficient to supply the gaps left by normal wastage. immediately on the cessation of hostilities in Europe it will be essential to carry out recruit-ment on a substantial scale for the higher grades of the administrative,professional and technical branches of the Colonial Service.3. There are already several hundred prospective candidates who are now serving with the Forces noted for consideration, and with the approval of theTreasury and the co-operation of the Service Departments, arrangements arebeing made for these and other suitable candidates to be considered during the transitional period. For the reasons given above, it is a matter of serious concern that candidates who are selected under these arrangements, and whoseretention with the Forces is not essential on military grounds, should be released to take up their Colonial work with the minimum of delay.4. These candidates will not as a general rule come into Class A, since they will in almost all cases be young men. Nor will they normally be coveredby Class B, unless they can be considered as &quot;specialists.&quot;5. The total number of candidates likely to be drawn from the fighting-services for the higher grades of the Colonial Service during the transition period may be of the order of 2,000.   It is emphasised that the candidates[26929]
selected will not be getting out of the Forces to take soft jobs at home. their position will rather he &quot;that of men transferred from,one form-of national service to another of vital importance away from home and often in very exactingconditions, for which&apos;they have been judged to be &quot;particularly qualified.6. It is of the highest importance that candidates selected for the colonial service should be made available for employment in that Service at the earliestpossible date, subject only to overriding military considerations. It is suggestedtherefore that a definite ruling should be given that such candidates are to beregarded as &quot;specialists&quot; under the proposed arrangements and that instructions should be given to the Inter-Departmental Committee -to considerfavourably such applications as the Colonial Office may make, with the consentof the fighting services, for the re-allocation of individuals selected for theColonial Service.Colonial Office,15th February, 1944.
