THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1944. \ 0 \SECRET.W.P. (44) 134.25th February, 1944.WAR GABINET.DEPARTMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR CIVIL AVIATION.Report by the Chairman of the Committee on the Machinery of Government.THE Committee on the Machinery of Government are conducting a generalsurvey of the distribution of Government functions among Departments, theresults of which will be reported to the War Cabinet in due course. They desire,however, to make available to the War Cabinet an immediate interim report onthe subject of civil aviation.2. The Committee have considered the subject at length* in consultationwith the Lord Privy Seal, the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister ofWar Transport, in the general context of the responsibilities which will or mayfall to the Ministry of Transport after the war. In that connection they formed the view that the functions in respect of docks, harbours and merchant shipping,which before the war fell to the Board of Trade and are now discharged by theMinistry of War Transport, ought after the war to be added to the responsibilities of the Ministry of Transport.3. The Committee do not favour the creation of a separate Ministry ofCivil Aviation. The choice, in their view, lies between leaving the responsibilitywith the Secretary of State for Air and transferring it to the Minister ofTransport; the Committee found no good reason for transferring it to any other minister. They were satisfied that, for operational reasons, the current day-to-day control of civil aviation must remain in the hands-of the Air Ministry forthe whole of the war period.4. The main arguments in favour of leaving responsibility permanently withthe Secretary of State for Air are, briefly, that very close liaison is called for atall levels between the staff responsible for civil aviation and the staff (both civilianand uniformed) responsible for military aviation; that the problems of research,design and to some extent development are much the same for civilian as formilitary types; that after the war civil aviation and the R.A.F. (particularlyTransport Command) will be sharing airfields and ground facilities of all kindsand operating largely on the same routes; that the necessary co-operation can best be achieved through allegiance to a single Minister and, in particular, that civil aviation is likely to suffer if a departmental barrier is erected between itand the Royal Air Force.5. The Committee do not underestimate these arguments, but they feel thatthey are decidedly outweighed by the arguments in favour of transfer to the Minister of Transport, particularly if he is also responsible for shipping.The question is whether civil aviation policy is to be regarded primarily as partof the Governments air policy (a subdivision of defence policy) or as part of theGovernments transport policy (a subdivision of economic policy) : the secondseems obviously the proper view. Civil aviation is essentially a form of transport and its interests require to be co-ordinated with those of other forms of transport,both inland and overseas; there is no good ground for dividing the responsibilityfor this between different Ministers. (It was suggested to the Committee thatif civil aviation were transferred to the Minister of Transport there would be,or appear to be, a danger that its development would be undesirably affected by* M.G. (44) 2nd and 3rd Meetings.[26993]Copy *Nd.   Ci D
the strong pressure on that Minister of the older established transport interests.The Committee felt that a strong Minister with an efficient department couldbe trusted to avoid this danger.) Moreover, the Committee considered that,however excellent the administrative arrangements within the Air Ministry, itis in principle wrong that the Secretary of State for Air, whose major interestmust always be the P.A.F., should in peace-time also be responsible for a civilianinterest. It is much better that, like his two Service colleagues, he should be ableto concentrate on his defence responsibilities.6. The Committee consider that the transfer need not be fatal to the very necessary liaison between military and civil aviation interests, includinginterchange of technical information and operational experience. Carefuladministrative arrangements to this end will be necessary, and it is not too soonfor the Departments concerned to be working them out.7. There remains the question of the responsibility for forward planning of civil aviation matters during the period when current control must remain withthe Air Ministry. This has hitherto been the responsibility of the Secretary ofState for Air, the necessary co-ordination with other aspects of Government policybeing secured through the Cabinet Committee on Civil Air Transport under thechairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal. As to the effect on these arrangements ofthe suggested transfer to the Minister of Transport after the war, the committee feel it is not for them to make a recommendation. They were informed, however,that the Minister of War Transport does not feel able to assume this responsibility in the near future; that a transfer of part of the present staff of the CivilAviation Department would be necessary, and that, since the same personnel are engaged on current and future problems, such transfer, at any rate in theimmediate future, would be difficult if not impossible.8.   The Committee&apos;s recommendations therefore are : (a) that current control of civil aviation must remain with the Air ministry for the duration of the war with Japan;(b) that a decision should be recorded in favour of ultimate transfer of thewhole responsibility for civil aviation from the Air Ministry to theMinistry of Transport (the Secretary of State for Air, who informed the Committee that the Air Staff are opposed to transfer, asked thathis emphatic dissent from this recommendation should be placed on record);(c) that the Ministers concerned should be invited to arrange for animmediate investigation on the official level into the action that isnecessary to facilitate ultimate transfer;(d) that the decision in favour of ultimate transfer should not be made public at this stage;(e) that the proper assignment of the responsibility for forward planningduring the period until the transfer takes place should be determinedby the War Cabinet.(Initialled) J. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,25th February, 1944.
