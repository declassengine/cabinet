THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1944.SECRET.Copy No.W.P. (44) 138.1st March, 1944.WAR CABINET.IMPERIAL PREFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.IN a previous memorandum (W.P. (44) 129) I pointed out that the most striking recent instances of economic expansion have occurred where a nation,occupying a vast territory with a wide range of natural resources, has concen-trated upon the complementary development of those resources, and with that object in view has insulated itself from outside price competition which couldinterfere with that development. The essential features of the process have beenthe same whether in ultra-individualist America or in ultra-Socialist Russia.Even more remarkable in some ways, however, was the economic expansionon similar lines of the first British Empire in the Eighteenth Century. Thatexpansion was based on. the planned and controlled development of our thenColonial Empire. Of the success of that policy there can be no doubt. under it Britain built up for herself a position in trade and shipping that convertedher from the poor and backward country, described by Macaulay in a strikingchapter in his History, at the end of the seventeenth century, to the prosperousGreat Power that held its own for a generation against revolutionary andNapoleonic France. Burke notes that the exports to the West Indian and north american Colonies went up from under  500,000 in 1704 to nearly  5,000,000in 1772, and even these figures hardly do justice to the transformation of ourinternal economic structure brought about by a purely complementary trade which added so greatly to the resources at our disposal. Yet the developmentof the American Colonies themselves was even more amazing. When oneconsiders the means of transportation of those days, and then reflects that thepopulation of the Colonies grew in a little over a century to nearly three million,as large a population relative to that of the Mother Country as the whole whitepopulation of all the Dominions is to-day, one realises what a powerful enginefor the creation of prosperity and population our old imperial economic policyproved itself.In a sense the policy was too successful, for the growth of the Colonies in allthat constituted a prosperous self-confident national life outstripped the capacityof our Constitution and of our national temper at home to adapt themselves tothe new situation. But the policy was not itself the cause of the Americansecession, as Burke was never weary of pointing out. What caused the revolutionwas not the regulation of colonial trade, but the attempt to invade what was regarded as the rightful sphere of the colonial legislatures by the imposition of direct taxation.The old colonial economic policy was not abandoned after the AmericanSecession, but was, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, gradually modifiedinto a policy of mutual preference. In 1823 Huskisson opened the colonial tradeto foreign countries, subject to the imposition of moderate duties, ranging from per cent, to 15 per cent., from which British goods were exempt. As against these, the colonies enjoyed substantial preferences on their products, such astimber, wheat, sugar and wine. Under that policy Britain&apos;s new Colonial Empirebegan to make rapid strides. In spite of its much later start, Canada, up to 1845,was fully holding its own in comparison with the United States, and in the period1815-1840 actually attracted 532,000 British immigrants as compared with458,000 who went to the United States.It is an interesting speculation to think what might have been the progressof the Empire under Ffuskisson&apos;s policy of practically free trade within the[27007]b
Empire and moderate duties against the outside world, if it had only been given a few more years&apos; trial, and so had had the credit, which so undeservedly went to free Trade, for the great expansion which followed the Californian and australian gold disc over ics.In the case of British and Irish agriculture the destructive effects of free trade were postponed by the fact that Wheat prices remained high for a wholegeneration after the Repeal of the Corn Laws. The &quot; cheap loaf,&quot; in fact, had nothing to do with the period of our greatest prosperity, but only came in withthe world slump of the later seventies. The unfortunate Colonies, on the otherhand, had to bear the immediate consequences of the new economic gospel. Thiswas more than a mere incidental hardship inflicted for the sake of an economictheory. It should never be forgotten that Cobden and his associates were deliberately out to break up the Empire, and that Free Trade was, as indeed itstill is, a policy of Imperial disintegration. &quot; The Colonial system,&quot; so wroteCobden in 1842, &quot; with all its dazzling appeals to the passions of the people, can never be got rid off except by the indirect process of free trade which will graduallyand imperceptibly loose the bonds which unite our colonies to us by a mistakennotion of self-interest.&quot;As a matter of fact there was nothing very gradual or imperceptible in the strain imposed on colonial loyalty. The promising development of the coloniesreceived a sudden and disastrous check. For Canada the abolition of theCorn Laws was an absolute catastrophe, and for some years the entire financial,agricultural and industrial interests of Canada were paralysed, while theUnited States took full advantage of the new opening afforded to them. It wasin vain that the Governor, Lord Elgin, protested : &quot; All the prosperity of which canada is robbed is transplanted to the other side of the line, as if to make theCanadian feel more bitterly how much kinder England is to the children whodesert her than to those who remain faithful.&quot; The only thing that saved theNorth American colonies and all but lost them to the Empire was a reciprocitytreaty with the United States which the British Government arranged in 1854,and which practically put them inside the American fiscal system. Theflourishing.wine industry of the Cape was allowed to survive a while, but waskilled by the Cobden Treaty with France in 1880. The West Indies lost theirsugar preference in 1854. The duties which protected British exports to thecolonies were swept away in 1848.Gradually the various scattered members of the British Empire recovered from the blow inflicted upon them. But the recovery was cramped and restrictedall the time by the small scale on which each - colony, or later Dominion, hadseparately to work. Compared with the United States, which, with more than a century&apos;s start, had already developed a substantial and well-protected home market, they had no chance of securing either capital for further development, orimmigrants to help convert that capital into production and prosperity, or meansof transport to convey their products cheaply to the British market. Free Trade,in fact, meant an immense concentration of British creative energy upon building up the United States. Between 1841 and 1866, 2,640,000 British immigrants went to the United States, as compared with only 677,000 who went to Canada. In allsome 10 millions of our people, and thousands of millions of our capital, went tobuild up. not the Empire, but the Republic, and by their very going enabled theUnited States to absorb tens of millions more of immigrants of other Europeannationalities.Throughout these difficult years opinion in the Colonies adhered consistentlyto the belief that, sooner or later, Britain would come back to a policy of Empireeconomic expansion. The Colonial point of view was emphasised at the firstColonial Conference of 1887. In 1894 the first Ottawa Conference passedresolutions in favour of inter-Imperial Preference, only the United Kingdom andNew South Wales dissenting. In the following year the first reciprocalpreferential agreements were made by New Zealand with South Australia and canada. In 1897 the Empire&apos;s point of view was again strongly pressed onthe British Government on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee Conference.More particularly the Empire-representatives &quot;unanimously and urgently&quot;recommended the denunciation of the treaties of 1862 and 1865 with Belgium andGermany by which we had pledged ourselves not to allow the Colonies to givepreferential terms to the United Kingdom. The treaties were accordinglydenounced and the British Empire freed from a foreign stranglehold against any policy of mutual development. It is this same stranglehold which the UnitedStates is now seeking to reimpose.
The urgency of this issue arose because of the new policy announced bySir Wilfrid Laurier earlier in the year. Up till then Empire statesmen had always urged Imperial Preference on a reciprocal basis, and had not envisaged the possibility1 of any progress until the United Kingdom was prepared toco-operate. Sir Wilfrid Laurier decided to make a beginning by grantingpreference unilaterally to British goods, not only as a demonstration of Empiresolidarity and in order to give a lead to this country, but also basing himself onthe sound economic argument that increased Canadian purchases from theUnited Kingdom would result in increased purchases by the United kingdom from Canada. In this his forecast was justified by the result. United kingdom exports to Canada, which had been falling steadily, increased by 100 per cent,(from  5,172,000 to  10,345,000) over the next five years, and to  23,795,000in 1913, while imports into this country from Canada increased over the sameperiod from  19,218.000 to  22,965,000, and to  30,488,000 in 1913.So far as the lead to this country was concerned, Laurier&apos;s action and the earnest representations of the Colonial Premiers both in 1897 and again in 1902convinced Joseph Chamberlain that economic co-operation was essential to any effective policy of Empire development and Empire unity. But he failed to carry the country with him, and the great issue which he raised was overlaid by ourdomestic contentions and then by the first world war. On the other hand, theCanadian lead was taken up in rapid succession by the other Dominions,New Zealand introduced a preferential tariff in 1903, and our exports to new Zealand increased from  6,905,000 in that year to  10,838,000 in 1913.South Africa followed suit in 1904 with a resultant increase in our exports from 17,819,000 in that vear to  22,185,000 in 1913. Australia came into line in1907, and our exports grew from  24,096,000 in that year to  34,470,000 in 1913,Our imports from these three Dominions showed a corresponding increase from 45,920,000 to  70,640,000 between 1905 and 1913.After the last war, following up a resolution of the Imperial War Conferenceof 1917, Dominion preferences to British imports were further increased. Therewas also a considerable development- of inter-Empire preference apart from theUnited Kingdom. A special trade agreement was concluded between Canada and australia, subsequently extended to include New Zealand. Canada in 1920 nego-tiated a series of far-reaching preferential arrangements with the various West-Indian Colonies, the advantages of which also inured to the United Kingdom.The very substantial Canadian sugar preference was also extended to-Fiji, whichColony, as well as Cyprus and Mauritius, also independently establishedpreferential duties in favour of the United Kingdom. The proportion-of our exports which went to British countries increased from 37-18 per cent, in 1913 to41 - 95 per cent, in 1928 to the same countries and to 45-3 per cent, to the wholepost-war Empire.Meanwhile the first partial response on the part of...the United Kingdom wasmade in the budget of 1919 under which a preference of a sixth of the duty wasgiven on existing highly dutiable imports, such as tea, coffee, cocoa, sugar, driedfruits and tobacco, and of a third of the duty on the McKenna duties. The effecteven of these limited preferences was considerable. Most striking, indeed, was theeffect of the- 11 per cent, preference given to the Canadian motor-car industry,which became the centre of supply for American-type cars for the British andother Empire markets as well as for her own market. With the help of Americancapital poured into Canada the industry rapidly expanded. The immensecontribution which that expansion has since enabled Canada to make in the war effort should serve as a reminder that Imperial Preference is a policy not merely of mutual economic benefit but of defence and security&apos;. It also indicates that themost effective way. of securing American capital for our own post-war reconstruction will be to create the conditions of United Kingdom and .Empireexpansion by adequate local tariffs supported by adequate Empire Preferences.A considerable extension of these preferences was agreed to by the UnitedKingdom at the 1923 Economic Conference. The agreement was torn up byMr, Ramsay MacDonald&apos;s Government, but its terms were carried out, so far aspreferential remissions of existing duties were concerned, in Mr. Churchill&apos;s firstbudget in 1925. So far as certain new duties were concerned their place was takenby the allocation of  1 million a year to the Empire Marketing Board for thepurpose of stimulating the sale of Empire products in this country. A renewedeffort by the Dominions at the 1930 Conference to persuade the United kingdom to reciprocate more effectively was rejected. The main obstacle, then as previously,to any extension of Preference was that it involved the imposition of new duties.   [27007] . b 2
and consequently a departure from the traditional Free Trade policy of thiscountry.That objection disappeared when the great world depression of 1931 forced &apos;this country to adopt a protective tariff. For the principle that where there wereduties there should be preference had by then become generally recognised. At the ottawa Conference of 1932 the principle of mutual preference was embodied in aseries of agreements. While these agreements were of a tentative character andthe preferential margins established very moderate in their range, it was generallyunderstood that a generation of controversy had been closed and what Lord Baldwincalled &apos;&apos; the first step &apos;&apos; taken in a policy destined to be progressively developed and made increasingly effective. As a matter of fact these expectations of further, advance were not fulfilled in the next seven years. There was even some going back on the spirit, if not in the letter, of the Ottawa agreements in subsequenttrade agreements with foreign countries, more particularly with the Argentine.Nevertheless, there can be no doubt as to the positive effects of the Ottawatreaties. The years that followed were years of general recovery and our tradeexpanded in evey direction, foreign as well as Empire. The important fact is the marked rise in the proportion of Empire trade to total trade. Between 1932 and1937 our exports to foreign countries rose from  200 millions to  269 millions, anincrease of 35 per cent. Our exports to British countries, on the other hand, rose from  166 millions to  252 millions, an increase of 52 per cent., bringing our exports to the Empire up to 48 - 3 per cent, of our total export trade. The change was even more marked in our imports, very naturally as our exports had already-long enjoyed substantial preference in the dominions. Between 1932 and 1937our imports from foreign countries rose fr a  454 millions to  624 millions, anincrease of 37 per cent. Our imports from British countries rose from  248millions to  405 millions, an increase of 64 per cent., bringing Empire importsup from 35 - 3 per cent, to 39 - 4 per cent, of our total imports.Gross export and import figures are, however, of less importance than thecharacter, of these figures as bearing upon our total volume of production. Forthat purpose the really significant figures are those of our imports of rawmaterials. Between 1931 and 1937 our imports of food, drink and tobaccoincreased from  416 millions to  432 millions, i.e., by  16 millions. Our importsof manufactures from  261 millions to  275 millions, i.e., by  14 millions. Onthe other hand, our imports of raw materials rose from  173 millions to 315 millions, an increase of  142 millions, or 82 per cent. Of this increase over  65 millions came from British countries. There could be no more convincingproof of the expansionist effect of our domestic tariff and of the ottawa agreements taken in conjunction.The Ottawa agreements were, however, not confined to bilateral agreements between this country and the several Dominions and India. They included aconsiderable development of inter-Imperial preference between the Dominionsand India (now for the first time included in the preferential system) and between these and various parts of the Colonial Empire. Between 1932 and 1937 the totaltrade between British countries other than the United Kingdom increased from 70 millions to  157 millions, an increase of 124 per cent.An incidental, but immensely important consequence of the development of inter-Imperial trade even before Ottawa was the building up, under the nominalcover of the gold standard, of the sterling monetary system.&apos; When we were forced off gold, sterling not only showed its ability to stand by itself, but toeverybody&apos;s surprise remained perfectly steady, making nonsense of all theprophecies of a headlong, career of depreciation indulged in by the exponents ofthe old economic orthodoxy.&quot; The fact was that so high a proportion of our essential imports of foodstuffs and raw materials came from within the sterling area that they, and not the products of countries outside the sterling area,governed the price situation. In 1932 our imports of foodstuffs from the Empireamounted to over  160 millions as against  213 millions from foreign countries,and of raw materials to  58^ millions as against  106^ millions. By 1937 importsof foodstuffs, from the Empire had risen to  214 millions as against  217 millions from foreign countries, and of raw materials to  124 millions as against 191 millions. The Empire proportion of the two classes taken together amountedto 36-6 per cent, in 1932 and 45 per cent, in 1937. In 1901, on the other hand,our imports of foodstuffs and raw materials together only amounted to 105 - 7 millions, or 23 per cent, of the whole, a figure which clearly could nothave exercised the same effect on the situation.There can be no doubt as to the enormous contribution the developmentof inter-Empire trade in the last thirty years, and more particularly since Ottawa,
has made to the capacity both of this country and of every part of the Empire to sustain the war effort as well as to our own capacity to finance that effort. Itseems incredible that, instead of being encouraged to develop that policy on bolderand more comprehensive lines, we should now contemplate abandoning it orwhittling away its effectiveness in pursuit of the will-o&apos;-the-wisp of a revival ofthe mid-Victorian economic world.In this connexion there is yet another current legend which deservesexamination. It is that the Ottawa policy, even if it benefited the British Empire,did so at the expense of the rest of the world. That leaves out of account the factthat, if it had not been for the safety-valve of expanding mutual trade opened upby Ottawa and facilitated by the sterling system, we and every other Empirecountry would have been driven to much more drastic measures to protect ourseveral economic lives, with much greater consequential interference with international trade. As it was the trade of this country and of the whole Empirewith the outside world increased substantially after Ottawa, though not in thesame degree as our Empire trade. There can be little doubt that, if the countries of the European continent had not been precluded by the Mbst-Favoured-nation clause and by their terror of inflation from coming to similar agreements among themselves, they could have made a more rapid recovery and have secured theirown position with less detriment to world trade. It was their helplessness in that direction which opened the way for Dr. Schachfs ingenious policies for utilising the urgent needs of the lesser European countries to establish a German economicstranglehold on them.The post-war situation will offer to all the partners in the British Common-wealth and Empire an unequalled opportunity for an expansion which shouldexceed even that of the United States or of Russia in view of the greateradvantages with which we start, both in the extent and diversity of our resources and in the organised ability and enterprise at our disposal. That expansion neednot follow the American principle of capitalist individualism and unrestrictedfree trade within a single tariff; Still less is it likely to follow the rigid Statecollectivism of the Soviet system. It would naturally be far more decentralised,affording scope in each part for such measure of local protection as may bedesirable in order to create a full and balanced development of local resources,as well as for such free choice between socialist and individualist methods asmay suit the needs or political outlook of each community. Such a decentralisation-tion, indeed, is essential, as this war has shown, in order to afford a correspondingdecentralisation of defensive strength. We can be only too grateful for whatDominion industrial tariffs have done to save the situation in this war. And weare no less bound in duty to the common interest to give effective protection afterthe war to our own agriculture even against Empire competition. What isessential is that the preferential system of the future should provide a co-ordina-tion and concentration of the surplus purchasing and investing power of eachpart upon the development of the rest. And it can do so without prejudice to eachpart also developing its trade relations outside the Empire. The question is one,not of exclusion, but of priorities, of planned concentration of purpose, not ofunco-ordinated diffusion and dissipation of economic energy.It may not be easy to persuade every part of the Empire of the wisdom and ofthe immense opportunities of such a policy. It is not only here that long defunctpolicies exercise their influence or that statesmen are attracted by the speciousgeneralities of ready-made theoretical schemes for world regeneration. That isno reason why we in this country should not give the lead in proclaiming andinitiating a real policy of Empire expansion. The response to our initiative willnot fail to be forthcoming.On the other hand, whatever may be said by Dominion Governments at this moment in acquiescence in the line which we have so far taken in the washington disscusions, nothing can be more certain than that, if we and other empire governments should become committed to going back on the whole conception of a positive policy of Empire economic co-operation, there would be a wave ofindignant protest and resentment throughout the Empire. In this country at anyrate such a step would create the most passionate domestic controversy as well asarouse the most bitter anti-American feeling. We are still technicallyuncommitted. But we have gone dangerously far and are apparently stilldisposed to drift.L. S. A.India Office, 1st March, 1944.   ,
