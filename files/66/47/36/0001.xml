When the conference met in Sydney on the 13th December, the PrimeMinister (who was a delegate from the Western Australian State Labour Party)asked that the venue should be changed to Canberra on the grounds that he wasrecovering from an indisposition and that it was necessary for him to be inCanberra to deal with urgent war cables. In spite of some protests from Labourexecutives that they also had urgent matters to attend to which required their presence in Sydney, the mountain in this case decided to come to Mahomet andthe conference assembled, in Canberra on the following morning. There seemslittle doubt that this was a move on the part of the Prime Minister to have theconference held away from the influence of the Sydney Trades Hall and thathe felt that the conference would be more amenable in the atmosphere of Canberra.There was comment by some delegates on arrival in Canberra at the particularlyhealthy appearance of the Prime Minister. He had, however, described to meon the previous day the discomfort and lack of sleep from which he was sufferingas a consequence of what he believed to be an attack of shingles.3. The outstanding feature of the conference was the Prime Ministers,speech which was devoted, to an appeal to the Labour Party to abandon its policyof isolationism and the development of his suggestions for closer Empirecollaboration. The Prime Minister has repeatedly pointed out in connection withinvitations extended to him to visit the United Kingdom that it was useless for him to take part in discussions regarding Australian post-war international and empire relations until the policy of his Party had been modified. The objectof the Prime Minister at the recent conference was to secure a modification ofthis policy and in this he has been completely successful. In the field of external affairs the Prime Minister asked for and was given a free hand.4.   The first part of the Prime Minister&apos;s speech consisted of a somewhatpedestrian review of the war to date, but this served only to introduce a document&quot;which he had prepared for the purpose of indicating to the world at large[27002] B
the views of the Australian Government upon the problem of internationalassociation of countries.&quot; This document stressed the need for &quot; the establish -ment of a method which will guarantee the maintenance of peace and security.&quot;&quot; The history of the British race,&quot; said the Prime Minister, &quot; recordsthe evolution of the Parliamentary system of government under which manhas been able to make his greatest progress as a political, social, andeconomic individual .... The British Commonwealth has exemplified tothe world how autonomous nations can collaborate on matters of mutualinterest. It has given to the world a notable demonstration of the workingof an international democracy. The British Commonwealth, which embracessuch a large part of the territory and people of the world, can render agreat service to civilisation by the development of the fullest co-operationamong its members. From this experience as units in a greater unity theycan make a notable contribution to the wider circle of international co--operation.&quot;The Prime Minister then went on to suggest that &apos;&apos; the third British Empirewas in course of transition to the fourth &quot; in which the trend is to &quot; augmentan association of independent sovereign peoples by a common policy in matters that concern the Empire as a whole.&quot; In what directions, he asked, couldmeasures be suggested for improving the machinery of Empire co-opjeratjpn ?The aim must be to provide for &apos;Tun&quot;lah&quot;d&apos;continuous consultation, which mustbe consistent with the sovereign control of its policy by each Government.Nothing could be more satisfactory than the periodical conferences of PrimeMinisters since no one else could speak for their respective Governments withthe same authority, and in normal times conferences should be possible at fairlyfrequent intervals. The place of meeting should not necessarily be in London;meetings in other parts of the Empire would &apos;&apos; emphasise to the various partsthe reality of the&apos; interrelation of the Governments and the peoples of theEmpire in the same way that the King&apos;s Representative in each Dominion andColony typifies their loyalty to a common Sovereign.&quot; An Imperial War cabinet was, he thought, impossible, as Prime Ministers could not remain constantly inLondon, and the best interim arrangement is the presence of an accreditedrepresentative in the British War Cabinet.5. The Prime Minister then went on to set down the principles which, inhis view, should govern consultations on common policy. This portion of thePrime Minister&apos;s speech is attached as an enclosure.8. The Prime Minister quoted Lord Balfour&apos;s statement at the ImperialConference of 1926, that &quot; the Empire in its modern shape is a bold experimentand a very novel one. On its success hangs the assurance of peace, happiness,and prosperity over no small portion of the world,&quot; and said that it behovedAustralia to &quot; develop the free association of British nations to ensure that theBritish peoples make the maximum contribution of which they are capable tothe common good of themselves and the world at large. &quot;The responsibilities of citizenship to-day transcend national limits, and carry wider obligations assubjects of the British Commonwealth and the inhabitants of a world communityat large. The full expression of these responsibilities is to be a good Australian,a good British subject, and a good world citizen. They are complementary to each other.&quot;7. The Prime Minister then turned to international relations and, afterdealing with the causes of the failure of the League of Nations (which heattributed to the composition and machinery of the League and the advantage thatwas taken of these defects by the Axis countries), enquired what was the broaddirection in which Australia should proceed in the light of the two great experi-ments in co-operation between sovereign States the British Commonwealth, andthe League of Nations and the declared aims of the United Nations for theestablishment of a new world order. The nucleus of the machinery must be theFour Great Powers, but the smaller Powers had parts to play and contributions to make. &quot; Where, as in the case of Australia and New Zealand, they are auto-nomous nations in proximity to the Colonies of Powers whose seats of Governmentare situated in other continents, they are in a pre-eminent position to speak with authority on the problems of the Pacific and have a primary interest in theirsolution. The geographical location of Australia has determined her destiny tobe that of a Pacific Power.&quot; He suggested that if Britain, Australia, Canada,and New Zealand were to develop an understanding about a common policy in the
Pacific it was logical that they should co-operate in a regional organisation withthe other nations with parallel interests in this region. &quot; Regional arrangements are an essential component of a world organisation.&quot;8. The Prime Minister concluded his speech with an appeal to the LabourParty, which had &quot; a great tradition in organising co-operation for the welfare of the mass of the people,&quot; to do its part in this momentous opportunity to bringnearer to achievement the fellowship and welfare of all the peace-loving peoples,and moved the following motion : (1) &quot; The evolution of the British Commonwealth has exemplified the mannerin which autonomous nations can co-operate on matters of mutualinterest.(2) &quot;Participation in the further development of co-operation among themembers of the British Commonwealth, the nations of the world at large, and the Pacific nations in particular, should be subject to the sovereign control of the policy of Australia by its own people, Parlia-ment and Government.&quot;9. Although the proceedings of the conference were private, the full text ofthe Prime Minister&apos;s speech was issued to the Press by which it was hailed in mostappreciative terms. The Sydney Morning Herald, of the 15th December, com-mented on the fact that the Prime Minister&apos;s thinking on Australia&apos;s externalrelationships &quot;has advanced rapidly during the critical years of his nationalleadership,&quot; and that there was not a trace left of the old isolationism which had for so long coloured.the attitude of his party to Imperial and foreign affairs. Theproposals were &quot;practical and concrete&quot; and marked, &quot;especially as coming from a Labour Prime Minister, a valuable step forward in Imperial evolution.&quot;Mr. Curtin&apos;s stipulation that in the increased co-operation in international affairs which he advocated &quot;Commonwealth sovereignty must remain unimpaired&quot;required clarification, but it may well be that &apos;&apos; if world co-operation is to be built up on an enduring basis there will have to be some abatement of national-sovereignty by all the countries concerned.&quot; The Daily Telegraph of the16th December, whilst regarding the speech as a first step &quot; towards a more realistic world policy for his party,&quot; thought some of the phraseology extremelyambiguous and instanced his remark that Australia could not be governed in theyears to come &quot;without being harnessed to other nations.&quot; Since one of thoseneighbour nations was China, Mr. Curtin assumed that one-third of &quot; Asia&apos;steeming millions will be with us,&quot; but how was Australia to recast her traditionalpolicy of trade and racial exclusion to ensure a friendly rather than a resentfuland potentially hostile China 1 Since Australia could rely on neither GreatBritain nor America for perfect security the alternative was a policy to avoidfrictions which might make Asia hostile. &quot; How are we to reconcile ourselves, asgeography demands we must, with vast populations awakening from a millennialsleep to a new era of industrial development and national expansion&apos;?&quot; TheMelbourne A rgus considered the statement &apos;&apos; an admirable mixture of politicalrealism and sound historic doctrine.&quot; The Prime Minister had made it clear thatthere was no need to seek methods of world co-operation &quot;inside the framework of untested ideologies,&quot; while there was the successful example of the BritishCommonwealth. The concept of a stronger British Commonwealthwas not at all incompatible with that of the &quot; Big Pour&quot; nucleus.On the contrary, the parts must be robust if the whole is to be strong, and eachconstituent nation of the Commonwealth must do its best to ensure that &quot; thattotality to which it belongs .... shall enter the years of peace with co-operative machinery functioning smoothly.&quot; The corollary to this was the easierand more frequent means of consultation which Mr. Curtin advocated when hepostulated frequent meetings of Dominion Prime Ministers. The &quot;FourthEmpire&apos;&apos; of which he spoke contained no suggestion of imperialism, for he made it clear that this federative nucleus would only be a part of a still greater federa-tion which would include all peace-loving nations. Mr. Curtin&apos;s proposals were based on concrete realities and though they might not provide Utopia, they didpresent a &apos;&apos; structure built on solid human foundations that have stood the test oftime.&quot;10. The only dissentient voice in the chorus of praise from all quarters wasthat of Mr. Menzies, who caustically described the statement as &quot;a completedisappointment&apos;&apos; and a mere restatement of the principles on which Empirerelations have been based for years.   Other Prime Ministers, he remarked, had[27002] b 2
established and maintained very frequent contacts with Great Britain and theother Dominions. It had been left to Mr. Curtin to theorise about them, and itwas &apos;&apos; superb irony &apos;&apos; that the stay-at-home Mr. Curtin should now announce thatthat there could be no substitute for conferences of Prime Ministers on Empirepolicy. Mr. Menzies did, however, admit that the speech was none the lesswelcome because it involved a complete reversal of the traditional point of viewof the Australian Labour Party. This, indeed, summarises informed comment on the speech; it was not remarkable for anything novel in its content but forthe place in which it was made and the reception which it thei&apos;e received.11. The remainder of the proceedings of the Conference, whilstovershadowed by the Prime Minister&apos;s statement, resulted in decisions on allcontroversial topics of a nature least likely to embarrass the Government and a moderate line of policy was favoured throughout. A colourless resolution waspassed on financial policy, viz. : -&quot; That in order to implement the party&apos;s financial policy, the Common-wealth Government be requested to take appropriate action to give effect tothe principles embodied in Labour&apos;s banking policy.&quot;It is noted that the word &apos;&apos; requested &apos;&apos; is not mandatory, and it is not expected that the Government will feel it necessary to take any action.There was complete ratification of the Full Federal Cabinet&apos;s decision to seekby referendum in 1944 only the temporary powers recommended by the 1942Constitutional Convention, and to leave till after the war the wider constitutional reforms which are in the party platform.The appointment by the Commonwealth of a general constructive authorityfor housing was recommended, and a recommendation for an increase in invalidand old age pensions was made. A motion to recognise the Jewish people as a nation was .rejected.&apos; The Conference approved of a nation-wide campaign forsocialism, but opinion was freely expressed that little would be heard on this issuetill the next conference.12. The result of the Conference must be regarded as another personaltriumph for the Prime Minister, who has greatly enhanced his reputation by his speech to the Conference. The moderate line adopted on domestic issues was a tribute to the good sense of the delegates and is evidence of the confidence of theParty in the Prime Minister. The Empire and international policy which theParty has approved will permit the Prime Minister to go overseas with the freehand to speak for Australia on Empire and world affairs, which he has throughoutinsisted was necessary before he could usefully undertake such a visit. the bearing of the Prime Minister after the Conference was regarded as an indication of his elation with the results achieved, whilst in reply to a private congratulatoryletter from myself he evinced considerable gratification at the Conference results,and said that he looked forward with keen interest to the successful developmentof his policy.13. I am sending copies of this despatch to the United Kingdom high commissioners in Canada, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa.I have the honour to be,My Lord,Your most obedient,humble Servant,W. GARNETT(For the High Commissioner).
Extract from Mr. Curtin&apos;s Speech at the Triennial Conference of theAustralian Labour Party, 14th December, 1943.In my opinion, the following principles should govern consultations&quot; oncommon policy : (1) The Australian and other Dominion Governments should have full knowledge of all essential facts, developments and trends of policy.(2) They should obtain this knowledge in time to express their views before decisions are taken.(3) They should have the opportunity, through their accredited repre-sentative, of presenting to and discussing with the War Cabinet,important committees, the Prime Minister and other Ministers, any suggestions as to the new policy or views on the policy under jconsideration that the Government may from time to time desire tosubmit.The High Commissioners in London and the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should normally be a standing sub-committee of the Imperial conference to handle matters in the intervals when they cannot be dealt with by PrimeMinisters or Ministers. It should be presided over by the British PrimeMinister or his deputy. It would co-opt, where necessary, British Ministers, orDominion Ministers visiting London.Corresponding to meetings of Prime Ministers, there should be meetings ofother Ministers as occasion may require, to deal with important questions of mutual interest, such as trade and communications. Again, such conferencesneed not necessarily be held always in the one place. On occasions, the questionsmay only affect certain parts of the Empire.In addition to periodical meetings of Prime Ministers and Ministers, thereis also the permanent accredited representation of the Governments to each other in the form of High Commissioners. These constitute a continuous personal linkto supplement the direct correspondence between Governments. The high commissioners are also able to represent their Governments on bodies created forthe consideration of special aspects of Empire interests and relations. an illustration is the Committee of Imperial Defence, which is usually presided overby the British Prime Minister. On a lower plane are the staffs of high commissioners, who should be regularly rotated with other members of theservices of the part of the Empire from which they are drawn. This arrange-ment should be supplemented by attachments and exchanges between the staffs of corresponding departments throughout the Empire. Dominion officers serving in London can be used by the accredited representative of the Government as a valuable adjunct in liaison with British departments.Of primary importance on the staff level is the secretariat of the ImperialConference. This would normally be located in London, but it would be anambulatory body, and function for conferences at the place of meeting. AllDominions would be represented on the secretariat. It would be responsible forseeing to the preparation and presentation of information on subjects to beconsidered by the conference from time to time. It would follow up the decisionsof the conference in regard to the completion of action or re-submissions to theconference. It would provide the conference with an agency for continuity in itsdetailed work, which is important, in view of changes which occur in Govern-ments and Prime Ministers. The secretariat would not supersede the presentestablished direct channels of communication between Governments, though its members would be directly responsible to their respective Prime Ministers.Outside the scope of Governmental machinery, great benefits are to beobtained by regular visits between representatives of Parliamentary Associations,the press, trades unions, cultural, professional and commercial organisations.
