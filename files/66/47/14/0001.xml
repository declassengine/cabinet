NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.I. H.M. submarines and Norwegian light craft have successfully attacked enemy shipping off the Norwegian coast.A U-boat supply ship has been sunk in the Indian Ocean.A Japanese.cruiser has been torpedoed off Sumatra.Aircraft from escort carriers have provided efficient cover for convoys in theS.W. Approaches.Two U-boats have been sunk, three probably sunk and two possibly sunk.Norwegian Waters.2. On the night of the 10th/11th four Russian aircraft bombed the Tirpitzin Altenfiord.   One near miss with a 1,000-lb. bomb is claimed.3. On the 11th aircraft from H.M.S. Furious attacked shipping in theNorwegian leads. A large northbound laden convoy previously reported was notsighted, and the only target seen was a cargo.ship, probably the Germans.s. Emsland (5,170 tons), which was beached and under repair. Many bomb hits were claimed on this ship. Five enemy aircraft were airborne at the time of the attack, of which one was destroyed, one probably destroyed and two damaged.One Seafire was lost. Ships of the Home Fleet, including the French battleshipRichelieu and three Canadian destroyers, covered the operation.4. H.M. S/M Stubborn sank or damaged five ships in the Kya area. Shewas herself damaged by depth charges, and naval and air escort have been sentto her assistance.On the 10th H.M. S/M Satyr, patrolling N. of Egersund, scored possiblehits on a cargo ship and two trawlers.5. On the evening of the 13th the Norwegian M.T.Bs. 627 and 653 sank two German ships, the Irma (1,392 tons) and the Henri (622 tons), carrying passengersfrom Aalsund to Kristiansund.6. On the 14th Russian aircraft raided Hammerfest (N. of Altenfiord) and sank two small ships.Home Waters.7. A convoy of 37 ships from N. Russia, escorted and covered by H.M.cruisers and destroyers, arrived in Home Waters on the 11th.8. Early on the loth five M.T.Bs. intercepted three enemy trawlers off theDutch coast. One trawler was torpedoed and probably sunk, and the other two were damaged by gunfire. Later a number of E-boats were engaged, five ofwhich were damaged. Our force sustained minor damage and there were tourfatal casualties, including the senior officer of the unit.Mediterranean.9. On the 10th H.M. cruisers Dido and Mauritius with two destroyers bombarded off Anzio and H.M. cruiser Penelope off Formia. On the 12th and 13thH.M. cruiser Phosbe with three destroyers operated off Anzio, and Dido, offFormia, made seven bombardments in daylight and five during the night. Onthe 14th the U.S. cruiser Philadelphia bombarded off Anzio. Shelling from landartillery and raids by enemy aircraft have persisted throughout the week.On the 15th the US. destroyer H. C. Jones was near-missed by two gliderbombs off Anzio and was slightly damaged. Two L.C.Ts. have been salvagedfrom the beaches at Anzio.10. On the afternoon of the 10th and throughout the 11th unloading was stopped due to heavy weather. Some unloading took place on the 12th, sincewhen fine weather has persisted and unloading has proceeded rapidly. Onthe 14th, 4,178 tons were unloaded, and on the 15th, 5,830 tons, making a totalof 81,000 tons unloaded in the Anzio area.On the night of the 13th/14th our coastal forces damaged an escorted south-bound convoy of lighters south of Leghorn.II. In the Adriatic H.M. destroyers Troubridge and Tenacious, sweepingbetween Ancona and Benedetto on the night of the 10th/l 1th, shelled two trainsand hit one of them.On the night of the 12th/13th H.M. destroyers bombarded Korcula Island.

S/M Torbay sank a caique off Lemnos.Black Sea,13. Between the 26th January and the 3rd February Russian forces sank two cargo ships, a barge and a lighter, and damaged two cargo ships, two barges and an F-boat.East Indies.14. On the 26th January H.M. S/M Tally-Ho torpedoed a southboundJapanese cruiser off the north coast of Sumatra. H.M. S/M Taurus sank aschooner and a tug by gunfire in the same area on the 6th February. On thefollowing day Taurus was bombed and slightly damaged.15. On the 12th H.M. destroyer Relentless sank the German tankerCharlotte Schliemann (7,747 tons), which was acting as a U-boat supply ship,960 miles S.E. of Mauritius.   There were 41 survivors.The R.F.A. Salviking (1,121 tons) was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat off theMaldives on the 14th.   There were 30 survivors.Pacific.16. The Japanese fleet, which is now inferior in every class of ship to theU.S. force in the central Pacific, has not interfered in any way with US.operations in the Marshalls.17. In the Solomons concentrations of enemy ,troops reported in the N.E.end of Bougainville Island have been shelled by destroyers. At night M.T.Bs.have shelled enemy positions in the Buka Passage and on Bougainville, wheregunboats have bombarded shore installations. M.T.Bs. also effectively interceptedbarges leaving Choiseul Bay.18. In New Guinea U.S. destroyers bombarded gun emplacements west ofSaidor and M.T.Bs. machine-gunned a floating dock south of&apos; Madang.Anti-Submarine Operations,19. Twenty-seven attacks have been reported, of which 11 were made by shore-based aircraft, one by carrier-borne aircraft, and the rest by surface craft,Two of the attacks were made in the Indian Ocean and one in the Mediterranean.On the 11th H.M. sloops Wild Goose and Woodpecker sank a U-boat in theS.W. Approaches. This was the fifth U-boat sunk by this escort group during their patrol. On the 12th IT.M. destroyer Paladin sank the Japanese U-boatwhich had previously torpedoed and sunk the s.s. Khedive Ismail N.W. of AdduAtoll. Paladin was seriously damaged and was taken in tow. Aircraft from.M.S. Fencer (escort carrier) probably sank a U-boat on the 10th in theS.W. Approaches^- and a Wellington probably sank another on the following dayoff Rockall.. H.M. Australian minesweepers Launceston and Ipswich with .M. Indian sloop Jumna probably sank a Japanese U-boat off Vizagapatam.Two U-boats were possibly sunk by aircraft in the N.W. and S.W, Approacheson the 10th and 11th respectively.Enemy Intelligence.20. The floating crane reported last week to have been stranded en route toAltenfjord, has been located at Trondheim in a damaged condition.It is reported that during the air raid on Toulon on the 4th the battle-cruiserBunkerque received a direct hit, and a large destroyer and a minelayer were sunk. Eighteen submarines (at least six of which were German) were seen atToulon on the 14th.At Leghorn on the 14th a petroleum and oil storage depot had been blown up.At Suda Bay (Crete) the ex-Greek destroyer Leon was being salvaged::    [,26953]      - .  , &apos; :     b .
4U-boats.21. Apart from some activity in the Bay of Bengal and to the west of Ceylonthere has been no change in U.-boat dispositions during the week.It is apparent that co-operation is taking place between enemy aircraft andU-boats in detecting and shadowing convoys as they leave the North Channel.It is estimated from photographic reconnaissance that not more than 200U-boats are now building and fitting out in German shipyards as compared with270 in October 1943.On the 10th a damaged U-boat entered Ferrol and has since been dry-docked.Enemy Attack on Shipping.22. The British s.s. Khedive Ismail (7,513 tons) with troops fromE. Africa in convoy to Ceylon was torpedoed and sunk N.W. of Addu Atoll.Out of a total complement of 1,506 on board, 200 were rescued.A ship in a northbound convoy was torpedoed off the east coast of Indiabut reached port.On the 10th a British tanker was sunk during an attack by three F.W. 200on Seidisfiord harbour on the east coast of Iceland (C). On the 12th an out-ward-bound convoy, when west of Cape Finisterre, was unsuccessfully attacked by seven enemy aircraft, two of which were destroyed and another damaged by aircraft from H.M.S. Pursuer (escort carrier). On the 16th aircraft from.M.S. Biter (escort carrier), escorting a convoy off the west coast of Ireland (R).shot down a Ju. 290 which had previously released a glider bomb which fell intothe sea. Later another Ju. 290 was destroyed by a Beaufighter. A U.S. ship was bombed and seriously damaged off Anzio.A French ship was mined and sunk in the Gulf of Naples and a small british ship was damaged by a mine off Ajaccio.Protection of Seaborne Trade.23. During the week ending the 13th, 927 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 287 were in ocean convoys and 640 in British coastal convoys. Five escort carriers, 67 destroyers (including 24 U.S. destroyers) and106 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes, were employed on escort duties.Five homeward-bound convoys, consisting of 197 ships, and four outward-boiuid convoys, consisting of 90 ships, reached their destinations without loss.24. H.M. trawler Strathella, missing since the 13th January while escortinga convoy to Iceland (C), was sighted by U.S. aircraft on the 13th February off cape Farewell. The trawler has now reached port in tow and the crew are reported to be safe and well.Allied Minelaying.25. Surface craft laid mines off the Dutch coast and the north coast ofFrance.During a minelaying operation in the Channel on the night of the 15th/16tha Norwegian M.L. was sunk and another was damaged, probably by enemy moored mines.  Two officers and three ratings are missing and 10 ratings were wounded.Aircraft laid mines off Oslo, in Kiel Bay, off the Frisian Islands, and off thenorth coast of France and Biscay ports.In the iEgean aircraft laid mines off Milo and Heraklion.Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.26.   No minelaying by enemy aircraft has been reported during the week.A number of E-boats were probably minelaying off the Humber early on the14th^ An M/S trawler on patrol in the war channel was sunk. On the same nightsix E-boats which were operating off Southwold were driven off by two ofH.M. corvettes and are thought to have jettisoned their mines. Three groundmines were destroyed in this area shortly afterwards.Minelaying by a U-boat is suspected in the western Channel approaches.Seven ground mines have been destroyed during the week, and the mine totalsare : 4,655 ground and 4,150 moored.27. In the Mediterranean two mines were destroyed in the approaches tothe Anzio beaches, where a dangerous area has now been declared.
5In the Adriatic dangerous areas have been declared off Ancona, Venice,Trieste, Pola and Fiume, probably as a result of information supplied bythe Italian Naval authorities.Enemy Merchant Shipping.28. In a review of the Hansa shipbuilding programme in German yards itis reported that in the five months ending the 30th April, 1943, ten cargo vessels of the standard 3,000-ton design were laid down. By December 1943 three ofthese vessels had been&apos;commissioned and four had reached the fitting-out stage.Since May 1943 work has been started on an additional 14 hulls, also of the3,000-ton design. At the present time 21 hulls, representing some 63,000 tons, arein varying stages of construction. Commissionings during the first six months of1944 are unlikely to exceed 30,000 tons. Evidence of the intensification of this programme is shown by the fact that the number of shipyards appropriated for ithas increased from seven to ten. Only two of the vessels (with an aggregatetonnage of 9,000 tons) laid down before 1940 were completed. There still remainsome 76,000 tons on which work is more or less suspended. In the yards of the occupied Territories it is more difficult to distinguish between Hansa and pre-Hansa building activities. Between August 1942 and the end of 1943, 52 vessels of approximately 167,000 tons have been laid down, and 37 of 168,000 tons, mostof which were laid down in 1939 or 1940, have been brought into service.It is also reported that after many changes a final schedule of cargo shipconstruction to be undertaken by Dutch and Belgian yards as a part of the Hansaprogramme has been decided. In the 3,000-ton class 65 vessels are to be built in Holland and 10 in Belgium; and in the 5,000-ton class Belgium will construct12 and Holland five. It appears that while two 3,000-tonners have been launched in Belgium none have yet reached that stage in Holland. The delay in delivery of structural components and in the manufacture of propulsive machinery hasseriously retarded the programme.29. Four of the larger ships engaged in the ore trade have been reportedbetween Bilbao and Bayonne.The German-controlled Vichy s.s. Saumur (2,955 tons) sailed from Barcelonaon the 12th with German and Spanish passengers for Marseilles.The tanker Celeno (3,741 tons) and the s.s. Bacchus (1,810 tons), which hasbeen renamed Brunhilde, sailed from Piraeus on the 9th for ports in Rumania.The Brunhilde arrived at Istanbul three days later. The s.s. Peter Hoos,ex-Vichy P.L.M. 16, (3,754 tons) entered the ^aegean from Istanbul on the 10thwith a cargo of 4,000 tons of coal, and has since arrived at Salonika.Japanese Merchant Shipping.30. During the last six months there has been a further decline in thetonnage of the Japanese mercantile marine, and it is estimated that up to the15th January, 1944, a total of about 2,802,500 tons had been lost. Owing tothe shortage of tankers a number of cargo ships have been converted to supplement the tanker fleet. After meeting the current requirements of the armed forces there is insufficient tonnage to transport all the raw materials available andrequired. Japanese steel cargo shipbuilding, inclusive of tankers, is estimatedduring the last six months to have been at the rate of 600,000 tons per annum.A further increase to 800,000 tons per annum is expected in 1944. It is estimatedthat not more than 60-70,000 tons of wooden ships were launched in 1943 ascompared with the plan for 400,000 tons. Some increase in 1944 must be expected,but taking everything into consideration it would appear that Japanese ship-building is inadequate to offset sinkings, which have been at the rate of at least\ million tons per annum.Italian Merchant Ships in Spanish Ports.31. The final negotiations regarding the release of the Italian ships in spanish ports proceed very slowly, and of the six ships which were interned in thePeninsular ports at the time of the capitulation of Italy only three have as yet reached Gibraltar. The tanker Fulgor (6,504 tons) and the s.s. Gaeta (4,457 tons)were towed there in November and January respectively, and the Lucia C.(6,123 tons) arrived from Vigo on the 14th. The Edera (5,254 tons) left Ferrolon the 16th for Lisbon, where she will bunker before proceeding to Gibraltar; the[26953] . b 2
6tanker Lavoro (7,886 tons) is still undergoing repairs at Cartagena; and thes.s. Cesena (1,570 tons) has not yet left Barcelona. With regard to the six shipsinterned in the Canaries, and, the Isonzo (5,441 tons)&apos;at Bio de Oro, there is atpresent no information.MILITARY SITUATION.Russo-German Campaign.Northern Sector.32. The Germans are still holding the Russians on the River Narva, butRussian forces have pushed southwards and cleared the whole eastern bank of lake Peipus. The Germans were gradually forced from their salient east of Lugaand the town itself fell to the Russians on the 12th. There is no confirmation ofa German report that on the 14th the Russians unsuccessfully attempted to landon the coast of the Gulf of Finland west of Narva.Central Sector.33. Once again the Germans have reported strong Russian attacks at Vitebskand south of the Beresina, claiming great defensive successes for their forces, butthere is no evidence of more than local fighting in these areas.Kiev Sector.34. After some days&apos; heavy fighting the Russians captured Shepetovka onthe 11th, while east of Vinnitsa the Germans claim to have surrounded and destroyed a Russian battle group in the course of their counter-attacks.German attempts to relieve the forces surrounded west of Smela have gainedsome ground but have not succeeded in breaking through the Russian ring, and meanwhile the Russians have compressed the area held by the encircled forces.Dnieper Bend.35.   The Russians have made a slight advance south of Krivoi Rog.General.36. The Russians&apos; main territorial gain during the week has been in thenorthern sector, where their southward drive has brought them within some30 miles of Pskov, an important railway junction, the capture of which would gravely disrupt German communications west and south of Lake Ilmen.It is a considerable success for the Russians that the Germans have not succeeded in relieving their formations west of Smela. Further attempts may still be made either from within or without to force a passage of escape for theseformations, but they have now been cut off for nearly a fortnight and must alreadybe suffering from serious supply difficulties.Italy.37. Activity on the Eighth Army front continues to be severely hampered,by heavy snow and rain. Throughout the week regrouping and reliefs have continued, and patrol activity on both sides has been active. A. Polish formationis now in the line, holding the central patrol area between Casoli and Alfedena.On the 15th the enemy mounted a large-scale raid from the Orsogna area,supported by tanks and machine guns, but this was broken up by our artillery.The situation around Cassino has changed very little. On the 10th, U.S.troops were, reported to have captured five more nouses within the northernoutskirts of the town, though later that day the enemy launched a strong counter-attack against the high ground west of Cassino. On the 11th, the U.S. formationwhich has hitherto borne most of the brunt of the fighting, after completingreliefs and regrouping, started a new attack on the position. This pressure was kept up throughout the next few days until on the 15th the formation was relieved by other Allied troops. Elements of the U.S. troops, however, still remain inthe outskirts of the town. The latest news is that the relieving troops were held up immediately east of the town by difficult terrain and strong enemy resistance.South of Cassino the low ground along the Rapido is reported to be badlywater-logged; our artillery in this sector fired throughout the night 13th/14thto give cover to our engineer working parties.
Along the lower reaches of the Garigliano there was only normal patrolactivity and reorganisation and reliefs. - * -In the bridgehead area the period which has passed has been marked bythe determined efforts of the enemy to break through our forward positions, none of which have succeeded to any degree. On the 10th some enemy infiltration tothe railway bridge at Carroceto, south of Campoleone, was reported, but armouredelements restored the situation during the afternoon. U.S. forces west ofCisterna have also been under heavy pressure, and several enemy counter-attacks have been repulsed. On the afternoon of the 11th U.S. forces occupied a factoryjust east of Carroceto, but lost it again in face of a heavy enemy counter-attack;early the next day they fought their way back to possess the factory again, onlyto lose it once more to the enemy. On the 14th an attempt by the enemy toconstruct a bridge across the river Molletta, near the coast, was frustrated by .S. forces. Enemy air activity and artillery fire increased during the early morning of the 16th and later a strong attack developed from the direction ofCampoleone against the Carroceto position; this was co-ordinated with a similarattack against the U.S. forces south of Cisterna.Yugoslavia.38. In West Bosnia fighting has continued in the Jajce area. The Partisanshave taken three towns south of Jajce and repulsed an enemy counter-attack.Farther west, Kulen Vakuf (40 miles north of Knin) and Bos Grahovo (15 miles north of Knin) have been captured by the Germans. Heavy fighting for thelatter town lasted for three days; some 500 Cetnik troops were included in theGerman force.   Fighting in the area continues.In Croatia the Partisans have recaptured Otocac and are continuing their attacks upon the enemy.Greece.Enemy Operations.39. German activity in the Yanina and Pieria (north of Mount Olympus)areas continues.Civil War.40. The Zervas delegates failed to arrive at the meeting arranged for the5th. A new rendezvous was subsequently agreed at which all parties were expected to be represented on the 13th.Burma.Arakan.   (An outline map is included as am inset.)41. The Japanese force which moved round our left flank emerged in thearea of Taung Bazaar, about eight miles north of our front line. From here theJapanese struck south and west, attacking the rear of our forward troops and establishing themselves across our lines of communication. Our forwardpositions have held against repeated Japanese attacks from north and southand progress has been made by fresh troops moving down from the north inclearing the area of the main north to south road from Bawli Bazaar toMaungdaw. Contact has been re-established with certain isolated detachments.The main concentration of Japanese behind our forward positions has been northand east of Sinzweya, To the west they established a position astride theNgakyedauk Pass, from part of which they were dislodged on the night 14th/15th.From time to time they have raided the main road further north towardsNgangyaung. During this period most of our forward troops were supplied by air.Pacific Theatre.New Guinea.42. In the coastal sector, on the 8th, Australian forces advancing from theeast made contact with the U.S. troops from Saidor, at a point about 12 miles east, of Saidor.New Britain.43. U.S. patrols moving east from Cape Gloucester have reached CapeMensing, 20 miles east of Cape Gloucester.   Patrols from both Cape Gloucester
and Arawe have reached the Itne River (on the south-west coast about half-waybetween the two) without encountering Japanese, but it is not known if the twoforces have made contact.More than 1,200 Japanese dead have been found on the trails in WesternNew Britain, having died as a result of starvation, disease and wounds.About the 11th, U.S. Marines landed unopposed on Rooke (Umboi) and SakarIslands (in the straits between New Britain and New Guinea).Solomons.44. New Zealand and U.S. troops landed on Nissan Island, the largest ofthe Green Islands (60 miles north-west of Bougainville), on the night 14th/ 15th,and successfully established two beach-heads. Any Japanese garrison on&apos;the island is thought not to be large.AIR SITUATION.General Review.45. Berlin was attacked by the largest force which has so far bombed the city.In Italy, a heavy scale of attack was maintained on enemy targets behind theAnzio battle lines.Heavy attacks were made on Kavieng (New Ireland) and on airfields in NewBritain. .United Kingdom.46. On the night of the 13th/14th, about 150 long-range bombers approached the East and South-East coasts; about 100 made landfall, with 15 reaching theGreater London area. Mosquitoes destroyed four enemy bombers, of which one was shot down over Belgium, and A A. a further three. On the two precedingnights, a total of about 30 enemy aircraft, largely fighter-bombers, attackedSouth-Eastern England, seven reaching the Greater London area; one Me. 410was shot down by fighters. On one other night, two enemy aircraft flew recon-reconnaissances over Northern Scotland.Home Waters.47. Typhoons, Beaufighters and Albacores attacked enemy shipping off theFrench and Dutch coasts; two ships, of 7,000 tons and 3,000 tons, five coasters,an E-boat and a trawler were damaged and a 5,000-ton ship was probablytorpedoed.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 157 were despatched, laid 466 sea-mines.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.48. Four hundred and seventy-three U.S. heavy bombers were despatched toattack the following targets : Date.	Target.	Attacked by.	Tonnage.	Results.10th 11th	Brunswick ... Gilze-Bijen airfield Frankfurt   .......       ... Ludwig8hafen      ... Saarbrucken	141 Fortresses 27 Liberators 157 Fortresses 34 Fortresses 19 Fortresses	312 63 265 88 35	Unobserved. Unobserved. Unobserved. Unobserved. Good.In these operations, in which nearly 2,000 fighters co-operated, 120 enemy aircraft were destroyed, 26 were probably destroyed and 104 were damaged, forthe loss of 34 Fortresses and 21 fighters.Military Objectives in Northern France were again heavily attacked on sixdavs of the week by aircraft of the Allied Expeditionary Air Force and theEigMh U S Air Force.   Of the 2,014 heavy, medium, light and fighter-bombers
despatched, 1,591 attacked the primary targets, dropping 2,731 tons of bombswith varying results. Some of the remaining aircraft bombed other targets,including coastal defences and three airfields in Northern France. &apos; In addition,a total of .81 fighter-bombers attacked two airfields in the Low Countries. Inthese operations, fighters (which flew about 1,500 sorties) and bombers destroyed18 enemy aircraft and damaged 17; one heavy, one medium, one light and11 fighter-bombers and fighters are missing.Night.49. On the night of the 15th/16th, 891 aircraft of Bomber Command were despatched to bomb Berlin; 796 aircraft carried out a blind-bombing attack,dropping 2,610 tons the heaviest tonnage yet dropped on any target in one opera-tion. The attack opened a little early with marker bombs and sky marker flares.The former were soon lost in cloud, but the latter achieved a good concentrationwhich was maintained throughout the attack. Mosquitoes, which attacked afterthe main force, reported a huge pall of smoke over the city rising to 20,000 feet.A diversionary attack was made on Frankfurt-on-Oder, 50 miles east of Berlin,by 24 Lancasters which dropped 94 tons of bombs with fair results. In addition,15 Mosquitoes attacked five airfields in Holland.  Forty-three aircraft are missing..On six nights of the week, a total of 134 Mosquitoes made small-scaleattacks on Berlin, Kiel, towns in N.W. Germany and airfields and other targets in France and the Low Countries. Two enemy aircraft were destroyed for theloss of two Mosquitoes. Leaflets were dropped on towns in France and Belgiumby 21 aircraft.Italy.50. Adverse weather conditions in the early part of the week materiallyrestricted operations, particularly of - the strategic bomber force; however, aconsiderable scale of effort was maintained by aircraft engaged in tacticaloperations.. About 270 sorties were flown by heavy bombers, and over 600 tons of bombs dropped on enemy communication centres and troop concentrations immediatelybehind the Anzio battle line; the principal attacks were directed against Albano,Cisterna, Cecchina, Velietri and Campoleone. Six heavy bombers were lost fromthese operations. At Monte Cassino, the Benedictine Monastery was attacked by143 Fortresses; 256 tons of bombs were dropped, resulting in the completedestruction of the monastery and adjacent buildings.On three nights Wellingtons systematically attacked roads in the vicinity ofthe Anzio battle front, special concentration being directed upon the roadsrunning through Cecchina and Albano to Rome; about 330 tons of bombs were dropped in these operations. Further night operations were carried out byBostons, when transport vehicles, railway wagons, and road junctions wereefiecuiveiy atucieKea.Medium, light and fighter-bombers provided support for our land forces,and fighters protected the beachhead and carried out offensive reconnaissances andpatrols. During these supporting operations in the Anzio and Cassino battleareas, heavy attacks were made on enemy assembly areas, troop and armouredconcentrations, gun positions, supply dumps and M.T. In the same areas, heavy and effective attacks were made on railways, roads, bridges, locomotives and buildings. The principal districts attacked behind the Anzio battle front wereCampoleone, Cisterna, Littoria, Albano and Sezze, and, behind the Cassino front,at Atina, Piedimonte, Frosinone and south of Avezzano. Although in many instances results could not be observed, it is known that a considerable numberof M.T. were destroyed or damaged, an ammunition dump set on fire, cars and railway wagons destroyed, and much damage done. On the 8th Army front,during an attack by fighter bombers, 46 snowbound M.T. were destroyed and afurther 50 damaged. In these operations fighters, medium, light and fighter-bombers flew 4,494 sorties.In the later part of the week, strategic&apos;bombing of railway centres north of rome was carried out by 250 escorted heavy and about 110 medium bombers. InNorthern Italy, the most important rail centres attacked were at Verona, Modena,Mantua and Ferrara, and further south in the areas around Spezia, Leghorn,Florence, Pisa, Arezzo and Perugia. In addition to other considerable damageresulting from these attacks, the northern end of the viaduct at Bucine (near
10Arezzo) is believed to have been hit. In the Verona area, the heavy bombers were attacked by enemy fighters, of which 19 were destroyed for the loss of four heaviesand two fighters. Other railway and road targets nearer Rome were attacked byLightnings and Invaders, and the latter also bombed the airfield at Barbara(22 miles W.N.W. of Rome).Enemy activity was on a most moderate scale; only on one day were as many as 100 enemy aircraft seen in the battle areas. Some night attacks by enemy bombers were made on our shipping at Anzio. During the week, 32 enemy aircraft were destroyed, and 47 aircraft were lost by the Mediterranean Allied Air Force.South of France.51. The Antheor Viaduct near Cannes was bombed by 10 Lancasters basedon the United Kingdom; 50 tons of bombs were dropped, including nine of12,000-lbs.   Severe light flak and searchlights made results impossible to assess.Yugoslavia and Albania.52. Sixteen miles S.E. of Split, Kittyhawks bombed and hit a 5,000-tonvessel which was later seen beached and on fire.
