THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT  Printed for the War Cabinet.   Mdrch 1944. 150-XI_*5 C-SECRET. &apos; Copy No. d 3W.P. (44) 143.2%d March, 1944.WAR GABINET.EMPIRE ECONOMIC POLICY.THE Prime Minister has asked me to circulate to my colleagues a statement on Empire economic policy which I have, as Leader of the House of Lords, receivedfrom Lord Croft.C. .Dominions Office, 2nd March, 1944.&apos;&apos; I feel most strongly that when the Prime Ministers meet we should impressthe following facts : (a) That Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement, in referring to &apos; the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in internationalmatters,&apos; was never understood in Great Britain, and certainly not by the Conservative Party, to refer to domestic Preference within theambit of the British Commonwealth and Empire; that thesePreferences are not discriminatory as between one foreign country andanother, but were, in fact, taking a great step forward towards freer-exchange in one quarter of the world, following the example of theCustoms Union of the United States, if not so complete.A principle which is sound in the United States is no less soundin the Commonwealth and Empire merely because the component partsare joined by water rather than by land.(b) That we are opposed to any abandonment of the system .of imperial preference of which Sir Wilfrid Laurier was one of the originators,and which has provided Great Britain with sure markets for hermanufactures, and the Empire a more stable market for their primary products, unless there is overwhelming evidence that great and permanent advantages to the Commonwealth and Empire will result,of which we see no sign.(c) That if the Dominions are not of opinion that a secure market for their primary products in Great Britain is of value to them and decide ,toabandon the policy which has proved so fruitful over forty-seven years,and desire to discontinue their Preference in favour of British goods,which we very much doubt, we will bow to their wishes with profoundregret, but we must reserve for ourselves the right to continue to grantpreference to all Dominion and Empire products in this purely familyaffair amongst the subjects of His Majesty.(d) That we are not of opinion that an American tariff lowered to 25 percent, can in any way compensate us for the loss of preferential entry into the whole Empire, and we very much doubt if the United Statesagriculturalists will be prepared to agree to the absorption of thosesurplus agricultural products from the Empire which we &apos; prefer &apos;to import into this country.* (e) That as a long-term policy we deplore any proposals which demand thepermanent total abolition of the right of the nations of theCommonwealth and Empire to trade with each other on a family basis,and, further, Great Britain cannot ignore the fact that more thanone-half of her manufactures were being sold to Empire countries[27031]
prior to the war, and any hope of replacing these markets in theUnited States or elsewhere is vain and contrary to all economicexperience. That if the United States persists in demanding theabolition of Imperial Preference it seems conclusively to point to herbelief that British trade and British Empire trade will be transferredto herself.(/) That there is a great body of public opinion in Great Britain whichregards Imperial Preference as the touchstone of unity and friendshipbetween the various countries of the Commonwealth and Empire. Itis not regarded as a transient measure but as a permanent faith anda policy of proved benefit, in time of prosperity as of economicdepression.(g) That the Empire should disarm economically would be just as fatal as military disarmament after the last war, and the abandonment of thepermanent substance of Preference for the transitory shadow of entry into the United States markets, which country will reverse her decision at the first change of Government, is economic suicide.(h) That the present Parliament was returned with a definite mandate forthe safeguarding of British industry and agriculture and imperial preference.It is impossible to abandon that policy from the British angleunless the electorate reverse the decision of the last election.&quot;
