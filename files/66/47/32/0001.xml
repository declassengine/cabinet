NIGHT ENDING 13th FEBRUARY, 1944.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air. -A heavy attack was made on Berlin; a small number of Lancasters made a successful attack on the Gnome and Rhone aero-engine factory at Limoges.Summary of Operations.Target.BerlinLimogesAntheor ViaductDate.30/31 January8/9 February12/13Aircraft ,Despatched.5401211In addition, 251 aircraft were despatched on small harassing raids on berlin and other German towns, and 585 mines were laid.Operations.Berlin (30th/31st January).Reports from crews state that this attack was well concentrated. reports from Intelligence sources indicate that it was probably a very damaging attack,the main weight of it falling in the central, western and southern districts;neutral reports refer to it as even heavier than the heaviest attacks in November.Daylight photographs have jusjt been obtained, but a full analysis of theresults of this and other recent attacks on the city has not yet been completed.Limoges (8th/9th February).A precision night attack by a specialist squadron of Lancasters was madeon the Gnome and Rhone aero-engine factory at Limoges. This factory had recently been re-equipped by the enemy and was about to come into full productionof engines intended for German transport aircraft. It was thus of appreciableimportance. Photographs, though of poor quality, show that severe damage hasbeen caused. Most of the south-west part of the works has been destroyed, andmore than half the main machine shops have been wrecked. In addition, several other buildings, some containing stores, have been damaged.Mining.New equipment in bombing aircraft has now made high-altitude minelaying.possible. It is no longer necessary for aircraft to fly low over heavily defendedareas searching for pin points before running up to the laying positions; nor does it matter, within limits, whether areas are covered by cloud.High-altitude minelaying was first started during. January 1944.   Aftertrials off the French West Coast U-Boat Bases and a Baltic Port, the new[26984]
technique was put into practice on .a considerable scale. Mines have now been dropped in this way in the following areas : Brest: Inner Harbour.St. Nazaire : Inner Approaches.La Pallice : Inner Approaches.Bayonne :&apos; Inner Harbour and Approaches.Heligoland Bight: Off the estuaries of the Jade, Weser and Elbe.Kiel Bay, Swinemunde : Approaches.Oslo : Inner Harbour.Frederikstad : Inner Approaches.The mines were dropped in the course of 289 sorties at the cost of two aircraftlost. Had the minelaying been undertaken by aircraft flying low, the heavy scale of light flak defences in these localities might have rendered the operations muchmore expensive. It is not yet possible to give a detailed statement of the losses sustained by enemy shipping as a consequence of this mining activity, but it isknown that the losses, both in merchant vessels and war vessels, have beenappreciable. There have also been indications that the enemy&apos;s sea-borne traffichas been dislocated in important areas, and that he is having to take emergency measures to deal with the situation.A. H. M, S. &apos;Air Ministry,24th February, 1944.
