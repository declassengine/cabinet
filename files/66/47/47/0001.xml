THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   March 1944. -_   159SECRET.        &apos; Copy No. 3 6W.P. (44) 147.6th March, 1944.WAR CABINET.COMMONWEALTH AND EMPIRE  CONFERENCE  ON RADIO  for civil AVIATION.Memorandum by the Minister of Aircraft Production (Chairman of theConference).THE Lord Privy Seal held British Commonwealth Conversations on civil air Transport during October 1943, the findings* of which were in generalapproved by the War Cabinet on the 27th October, 1943.t2. The Lord Privy Seal then asked me to deal with the problems of radiofor Civil Aviation, and the Radio Board agreed to issue invitations for a commonwealth and Empire Conference sin the matter. This Conference, whichwas held between the 1st and 15th February, 1944, was attended by the lord privy Seal and other Ministers concerned, and by Delegates from the UnitedKingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, and SouthernRhodesia.   A list of the Delegates appears in the Annex.3. The Conference confined itself strictly to recommendations in its technical field, without prejudice to their political aspects. Thanks to theenthusiastic work of the Delegates, applied to a series of papers provided for their assistance by the United Kingdom Departments concerned, the Conference was able to reach unanimous agreement and to put forward recommendations forconsideration by the Commonwealth and Empire Governments.4. In my view the Conference has been thoroughly successful and has fully justified the comparatively small diversion of effort which it entailed. Thepreliminary consideration by the Air Ministry and Ministry of aircraft production of the peace-time applications of the many war-time advances inradio, including radar, did much to clear our minds, and the overseas delegates were able to make most valuable contributions, based on world-wide experienceof widely differing climatic and geographical conditions. The representatives ofthe overseas Civil Aviation Departments were able to see for the first time the striking war-time advances in military radio, and exceedingly friendly relationswere established between all the Delegates.5. The following basic recommendations of the Conference arising fromtheir consideration of problems of Commonwealth, Empire and international co--operation, appear to be for decision by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and i accordingly submit them to the War Cabinet: 1&quot;,(i) We recommend that the establishment of a world authority for air trans-port embracing all nations is essential to the achievement of generalstandardisation of radio for international air transport. Unless anduntil world-wide agreement is reached on the wider questions of civil air routes and aircraft it will not be possible to reach final agreement on the radio services required,(ii) We consider that the present technical Conference has proved of great value, but the present Conference, fruitful though it has been, cannotcover the whole of its very large and important technical field. Wehave reached a stage where technical considerations demand an earlyexchange of views with the United States and others of the united nations.* W.P. (43) 462.[27046]f W.M. (43), 146th Conclusions, Minute 3.
(iii) We consider that further Commonwealth and Empire consideration will be required before it is- possible to summon a world-wide Conrference on Radio for Civil Aviation. The subject calls for continuousCommonwealth and Empire consultation and consideration bothduring and after the present war, in addition to the United Nationsdiscussions recommended in the foregoing paragraph.&quot;6. The Conference put forward recommendations for a complete series of standard radio systems which will be available in the immediate post-war period,including communications, navigational aids, aids to final approach, airway andairport control, collision warning and distress services.7. The Conference also put forward recommendations in considerable detailfor longer term plans for standard post-war systems. In a number of cases it wasnot possible to make final recommendations pending further experiments. TheConference specified these experiments, suggesting where and how they shouldbe carried out, and considered it essential that the technical results should bediscussed at a further meeting before final Commonwealth and Empire agreement could be reached.8. The full report of the Conference, much of which is of a highly technicalnature, will be communicated to all the Departments concerned, and will be avail-able to any Minister who cares to see it, but I do not propose to trouble the WarCabinet with so much detail. It is for decision by the War Cabinet as to whether,before any further steps are taken to proceed with these matters on a Common-wealth and Empire basis, immediate technical discussions, preferably on an informal and exploratory basis, should take place with the United States andwith others of the United Nations, based on the recommendations of the Con-ference. In this matter His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom mayfirst wish to consult&apos;the Dominion and Indian Governments. So far as the purelytechnical recommendatioDS of the Conference are concerned, I suggest that theymight suitably be remitted to the Radio Board.(Initialled) R. S. C.143.
