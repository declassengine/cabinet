THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   February 1944.SECRET. . Copy No.W.P. (44) 119.l$th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.OIL.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will have seen the Lord Privy SeaTs memorandum of the11th February (W.P. (44) 102) on the proposal of the United States Governmentfor an exchange of views with this country on the subject of oil policy. It may therefore be of value to furnish them with some account of the events which led up to the present situation.2. Following the indiscretions of the Five Senators in the autumn of 1943,reports began to circulate in Washington that a newly-formed organ of theUnited States Government, the Petroleum Reserves Corporation, was intendedto engage in oil production and distribution and in the acquisition of newconcessions in the foreign field, particularly in the Middle East. This createdconcern in commercial circles on both sides of the Atlantic, and in this countryserious doubts were felt about the possibility of competing effectively against aGovernment agency with the unlimited resources of the United States Exchequerbehind it. It was considered essential to find some means of heading Mr. Ickes,the Oil Administrator, off the project and our Petroleum Adviser in Washington,who was doing his best to hold the position by his direct personal relations withthe Administrator, expressed the view that the spectre of P.R.C. would notbe laid until there had been an exchange of views between the two Governments.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, the Foreign Office and the Petroleum Departmentshared this view and were considering how to broach the matter with the UnitedStates Government when, early in December, Lord Halifax received amemorandum from the State Department, inviting His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto participate in informal and preliminary discussions (Annex I).3. About this time, however, it became evident that opposition to P.R.C.in the United States &quot;was gaining ground and in consequence the need fortalks seemed from our point of view to.be less urgent. The possibility ofprocrastinating or returning an evasive reply to the American invitation wasconsidered, but as time went on the State Department began to press with increasing insistence for a reply, and there were even signs of a revival of activityby P.R.C., including reports of a project for the construction under its auspices of a pipe-line in Saudi Arabia. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador reported that anyfurther delay in replying to the State Department would weaken the hands ofour friends in the Administration, and it became clear that the issue had to be faced. At the beginning of February Lord Halifax was instructed (Annex II)to inform the State Department that His Majesty&apos;s Government welcomed thesuggestion for an informal discussion of petroleum problems on a world-widebasis and were prepared to. fall in with the suggestion (made by the President)that they should at the outset deal with the Middle East. The United StatesGovernment were also asked to indicate the points which they particularlywished to discuss.12282   [26962]B
4. The reply of the United States Government (Annex III) made it clearthat they were still anxious to concentrate on Middle Eastern petroleum questions.In reply to our enquiry about the scope of the discussions they put forward thefollowing &quot; tentative list of general topics &quot; : (1) Interests  of  producing  and  consuming  countries   in  Middle  Eastpetroleum.(2) The quantity of Middle East oil that should flow into post-war world markets.(3) Existing impediments to proposed production.(4) Transport problems.(5) Concession rights.(6) Price and marketing policies.It has been suggested that this list proves that the United States government intend to demand a large share of our oil interests in the Middle East. It maybe so, but it is on the face of it not certain that this interpretation applies to theproposed topics of discussion. Even item 5 (concession rights) which appearsto touch on dangerous ground, may well relate to the negotiation of newconcessions. It is, however, a matter of cardinal importance that there shouldbe no ground for misunderstanding on this point and that we should make itperfectly clear that we do not propose to discuss the transfer of rights in any form. Y/e must also remove any ambiguity there may be concerning theimportance we attach to the talks being world-wide in scope and not in any senseconfined to the Middle East. Provided we can secure the ^agreement of theUnited States Government on both these points in advance of the discussionsit is felt that any possibility of assets being surrendered under pressure can be countered.5. It cannot be denied that such pressure is likely to be formidable, and recent developments suggest that it is increasing. Mr. Ickes has admitted thathis recent announcement of the United States Government^ intention toconstruct a pipe-line from the Arabian oilfields to the Eastern Mediterraneanwas in the nature of a &quot; blunderbuss shot&apos;&apos; designed to accelerate the openingof international discussion, Moreover, on the 11th February the New York Timespublished a report to the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government were sending a delegation to Washington within a week or two to discuss the details of a programme for developing the oil resources of the Middle East. It was also stated that a Russian Mission was expected in Washington. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were informed that Mr. Stettinius proposed to issue that same days &quot; corrective statement &quot; to the press which would have committed us to aconference on Middle Eastern oil with all producing and consuming countries concerned &quot; in accordance with the principles enumerated in the atlantic charter.&apos;&quot;&apos; His Majesty&apos;s Government replied that they would not be preparedto agree to more than a statement in the following terms : -&quot; The Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom areundertaking preliminary and exploratory discussions on petroleum questions.These conversations will embrace first of all Middle Eastern questions.&apos;&apos; Should these preliminary discussions lead to conclusions, no decisionaffecting producing areas would be taken without consultation with the Govern-ments of the countries concerned.&quot;6. The State Department intimated that they would give the matter furtherconsideration and on the 15th February they informed His Majesty&apos;s ambassador that they would like to issue the above statement at noon on the following day and at the same time to announce the composition of the United States delegation which would include Mr. Ickes and other United States Ministers and wouldbe led by Mr. Hull. This would have created a completely new situation in thatit would have committed His Majesty&apos;s Government to conversations at the ministerial level instead of the official level previously contemplated. Moreover,as Mr. Hull and Mr. Ickes would certainly not be able to go abroad for a meeting,it also pre-judged the question of venue which had been left open. The state department were therefore informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government would haveto give further consideration to the whole matter and in the meantime could not agree to the issue of any statement, but a reply has now been returned to the latest.United States note in the sense that His Majesty&apos;s Government can only agreeto conversations at the official level as originally proposed and that the conversa-tions must be world-wide in scope (Annex IV). Lord Halifax has been instructed
when communicating this note to seek an assurance, in writing if possible, thatthe discussions will not be concerned with existing rights over oil property orproducts of any kind. Subject to the above conditions His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave agreed to the issue of the short statement quoted above. It is, moreover, tobe clearly understood that if Mr. Stettinius feels obliged to make any further statement at this stage he will not refer to any individuals by name or. by officebut will confine himself to mentioning the United States departments which areto take part in the discussions.7. The uninformed American views referred to in Lord Beaverbrook&apos;smemorandum and criticism of Great Britain generated by the Senators have undoubtedly contributed much to the pressure which is now being developed andto the anxiety of the United States Government -to start conversations as soonas possible. They have, however, been effectively disposed of in Chapter 7 of the presidents latest report on Lend.-Lease and are unlikely to be ventilated in thecourse of serious international discussion. The Americans would have no justi-fication for asking us to cede oil resources to them and Article 7 of the mutual aid Agreement protects us from being asked to do so in return for Lend-Lease,since to reduce our earning capacity would inevitably &apos;&apos; burden our commerce&apos;&apos;with the United States and postpone the possibility of unrestricted economic expansion. We must not, however, forget that we have hitherto received andare still receiving a far greater volume of oil products from the United Statesthan we ourselves are at present able to supply. We are, moreover, greatlydependent on the United States for the release of equipment for production,refining and distribution, including pipe-lines and tanker tonnage. without this equipment the development of our oil resources in the Middle East, whichwill be of great importance after the war, would soon be brought to a stand-still. In these circumstances, to deny to the United States Government anopportunity even to discuss oil problems would almost certainly prejudice thedevelopment of our oil industry after the war.&quot; Such a refusal would also playinto the hands of all enemies of Anglo-American cO-operation, notable amongwhom are the members of the Senate Committee now investigating the activitiesof P.R.C. It would, at the same time, alienate many of our proved friends,such as Mr... Ickes and Mr. Davies, of the War Petroleum Administration.Indeed, the disadvantages of creating an issue with the United States over oil in this way hardly require elaboration. There is, on the other hand, every advantage in meeting their wish to establish the basis of a satisfactoryunderstanding while the war provides an incentive to co-operation, if this cani.- j___A. E.Foreign Office, 19th February, 1944.ANNEX I.Viscount Halifax to Mr. Eden.(No. 5511.) Washington, 5th December, 1943.Following is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram in view of the great and world-wide importance of petroleum from long-rangeas well as immediate war-time view point, and of the fact that nationals of our two countries hold, to a substantial extent jointly, rights to develop extensive oil resources in the Middle East, this Government would welcome informal and pre-liminary discussions between our two Governments regarding petroleum problemsof mutual interest in that area for the purpose of formulating appropriaterecommendations to the two Governments.Immediate war requirements necessitate current considerations of measuresrelative to development of supplies in the Near East area for war and other essential purposes, involving increased production and expansion of facilities.These matters have implications of great consequence for the future. Accordingly,in order that these present questions and the continuing problems in the plan maybe brought into proper relation with a view to reaching conclusions on a basis of close co-operation, it is strongly believed that discussions should be undertaken[26962] b 2
promptly. If your Excellency&apos;s Government is of the same opinion, it is suggestedthat the two Governments proceed at once to designate representatives to meetwithout delay for the purpose of initiating these conversations.Because of the urgency and importance of this subject, it is requested that Ibe informed at the earliest possible moment of the views of your Government.ANNEX II.Mr. Eden, to Viscount Halifax.(No. 930.) Foreign Of/ice, 2nd February, 1944.Following is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram : His Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the suggestion of the United StatesGovernment for an informal discussion of petroleum problems. As the UnitedStates Government are already aware they would wish these discussions to beworld-wide in scope and not limited to any particular area. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, however, readily accept the suggestion that they should at the outset deal with the Middle Eastern aspect of petroleum and should thereafter be extended to cover the subject in its general aspect. They share the StateDepartments desire to reach conclusions on the basis of close co-operation.2. - In order to avoid unnecessary delay and to ensure that the conversationstake place under the most favourable possible circumstances, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would welcome some indication of those aspects of the subject whichthe United States Government particularly wish to discuss, and also of the preciselevel at,which they consider the discussions should be held.ANNEX III.Viscount Halifax to Mr. Eden.(No. 696.) Washington, 12th February, 1944.My telegram No. 666.Following is text of note from State Department, dated 10th February, and received to-day, about oil conversations : &apos;The Secretary of State presents his compliments to the British ambassador and refers to the Ambassadors note of 7th February, 1944, stating that theBritish Government welcomes the suggestion of United States Government thatinformal exploratory discussions concerning petroleum be initiated.It is noted that, while the British Government agree that these conversations at the outset should deal with problems of mutual interest regarding middle east petroleum, they should at a later period be extended to cover general subjectof petroleum. This Government believes that it may be found desirable to extend the scope of conversations beyond a discussion of problems concerning middle east oil, but that a determination of whether that should be done, and to what extent, can be made best in the light of progress of its discussions on middle east oil.In compliance with British Governments desire for some indication of theaspects of the question which this Government believes should be discussed, therefollows a tentative list of general topics which it is believed could be profitablycovered in the conversations : (1) Interests of  producing  and  consuming countries  in. Middle  Eastpetroleum.(2) The quantity of Middle East oil that should flow into post-war world markets.(3) Existing impediments to proposed production.(4) Transport problems.(5) Concession rights.(6) Price and marketing policies.
It is contemplated that a group of not more than five staff members willconduct conversations for this Government. The group will be headed byPetroleum Adviser of State Department as chairman and will include deputy director of Office of Eastern and African Affairs of the Department. It isbelieved to be auspicious for the outcome of conversations that both Governmentsdesire to reach conclusions on basis of close co-operation. This Governmentstrongly hopes that in this atmosphere the conversations can be initiated withoutdelay.2. May I have your observations for information of United StatesGovernment?3. It is now clear (see paragraph 6 of my telegram under reference) that weshall not get an American delegation to London, partly because of Departmentrivalries and difficulties in Washington, and partly because, while talks in washington will probably be well viewed by Congress and public here, talkselsewhere would be viewed with suspicion and their chances of success corres-correspondingly prejudiced. However much we may regret this, I am sure we shall be wise in our own interests to agree to talks here as soon as may be possible.ANNEX IV.Text of Note Communicated to the State Department by His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington on 18th February.His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom were about to reply to theState Departments note of the 11th February setting forth the views of the UnitedStates Government regarding the scope of the proposed discussions on oil whenthey were informed by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador on the 16th February that theUnited States Government proposed to announce forthwith their intention to convene a conference at Ministerial level in the near future.2. It had previously been understood that exploratory conversations at theofficial and technical level were contemplated and this impression was confirmed by the State Departments note under reply. It was on this understanding thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government agreed to the issue of the joint statement communi-cated to the State Department on the 11th February. In the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment a conference of Ministers should not take place until the groundhas been cleared in the preliminary discussions which have hitherto been contemplated.3. Provided that the preliminary conversations are at the official andtechnical level and are of an exploratory nature His Majesty&apos;s Government will beglad to meet the wishes of the United States Government by concentrating in theopening stage of the discussions on the Middle East, subject to the understandingthat the conversations will be world wide in their general scope and will not be specifically confined to any particular oil-bearing region.4. As regards the topics indicated in the State Departments note of the11th February, His Majesty&apos;s Government are preparing their comments.
