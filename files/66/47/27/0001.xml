(44) 127.21st February, 1944.WAR CABINET.POLITICAL AFFAIRS IN NEW ZEALAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.&apos;I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the following despatch from the United Kingdom High Commissioner in New Zealand.-    o: -Dominions Office, ..21st February, 1944.Office of the High Commissionerfor the United Kingdom,(Not 6.) Wellington, New Zealand,My Lord, 10th January, 1944...I have the honour to submit the following observations on the recentgeneral election, in the light of the final returns, which, owing to delays incounting the service votes, have only recently been completed.2. Election Results.The results of the general election compared with those of 1938 may besummarised, as follows : Voting.1943. .    1938.447,507 (47-6%) 528,290 (55-8%)409,577 (43-5%) 381,081 (40-3%)&apos;40,711 ( 4-3%) ... ...       .  ,,43,118 ( 4-6%) 36,942 ( 3-9%) ...940,913 946,313 ,&apos;Party Strengths. .,.1943. 1938.45 5334 26Labour ...NationalDemocratic LabourOthers ;..       ...Labour ...NationalDemocratic LabourIndependent   ...These results correspond with the forecast contained in my telegram No. 367of the 7th September, stating that it was expected that Labour would be returned, Ibut that their majority would be reduced owing partly to the swing of thependulum and partly to the split in the Labour vote caused by the new DemocraticLabour Party. It will be noted that the decline of 80,000 in the Labour vote(equivalent to, 2,400,000 in the United Kingdom) appears to have been due less to; an increase in that of the National Party than to the vote for DemocraticLabour, which: also turned the scale in four out of the eight seats won fromLabour by the National Party. As the Democratic Labour is politically to the[26973] b
left of official Labour, the swing to the right was smaller than might be inferredfrom the reduction in the Government majority.3. Service Vote.Though the Labour Government have emerged from the election with anadequate majority, they escaped defeat only by a narrow margin and thanks to a somewhat unexpected factor. On the civilian vote alone the election would&apos;, have resulted in a tie between the Labour and National parties, with 40 memberseach. The situation was saved for the Government by the service vote, whichturned the scale against the National Party by majorities ranging from only14 to 212 in six closely contested constituencies. The following table shows thedivergence between the civilian and the service vote : Civilian. Service.Labour.........      ... 47-0% 53-0%National         ......... 44-5% 35-4%Democratic Labour    ...... 4-0% 6-7%Others............ 4-5% 4-7%It will be seen that whereas the civilian vote shows a marked swing towardsthe right as represented by the National Party, the service vote shows an evenStronger swing in the opposite direction.4. Country Quota.Labour&apos;s. narrow escape, notwithstanding its substantial lead in votes, was partly due to a peculiarity in New Zealand&apos;s electoral system. This is the&quot; country quota,&quot; under which in the allocation of the 76 European electoratesa 28 per cent, addition is made to rural populations, with the result that the rural areas, though comprising only 40 per cent, of the European electorate, at presentreturn the same number of members of Parliament, viz., 38, as the urban areas with 60 per cent, of the electorate. The following table shows the number ofLabour and National members returned by these two types of constituency, and.also by the 4 Maori constituencies, at the last two general elections : 1938. 19AS.Labour.    National.    Labour.    National.Urban.........      35* 3 31* 7Rural.........      16 22t 11 27Maori.........        3 1 454 26 46 34* Including one Independent supported by Labour.f Including one Independent supported by the National Party.Since an overwhelming majority of the urban electorate return labour members, while the National Party hold most of the rural electorates, the countryquota is equivalent to weighting the electoral system in favour of the NationalParty. After the election of 1938 the Labour Party felt strong enough to carrythis handicap, but under present circumstances, as has already been hinted bytheir official organ, it would not be surprising if they were to take steps to reduce,if not to abolish, it while there is still time.5. Maori Constituencies.  .Apart from the services, the only section of the community among whomLabour did not lose ground was the Maori nation. Here Labour scored its onlygain at the expense of Sir Apirana Ngata. the veteran Maori leader, who lost aseat which he had held uninterruptedly since 1906. There seems to be no doubtthat his defeat is entirely due to the effects of Social Security, whose benefits, fixed on a scale appropriate for European with an unusually high standard ofliving, represent comparative affluence to the average Maori; so much so, in fact,that there have grown up among them a new type of profession, a kind of social security consultant, who makes a living by advising his clients how to secure allthe-various benefits to which they are entitled under the Act: The political consequences of this systematic pauperisation of the Maori people are&apos;reflected in the return of Labour members for all four Maori constituencies, none of whichwas held by Labour before the passing of the Social Security Act before thegeneral election in 1938.
6. Other Parties. VThe election was contested by a record number of 291 candidates, or gettingon for an average of 4 per constituency. Of these, 135 were fancy party or freakcandidates, standing under no less than eleven different labels, mostly for some form of social credit, with which New Zealand is widely infected. Thoughpolling about 9 per cent, of the votes recorded, in the event not one of the 135 waselected and all but 9 lost their deposits, which in New Zealand are fixed at theinadequate sum of  10. On the other hand, as will be seen from the followingtable, which compares the actual parliamentary representation. of the various parties with that which,they would have received if it had been in proportion totheir electoral strengths, under a strict system of proportional representationthis fringe of the electorate would have held the parliamentary balance :-  &apos;&apos;&quot; !:!Proportion.   Returned.Labour     ............. 38 45National   .........       ... 35 34Democratic Labour       -...       ... 3 0Independents      ...      ...      ... 3 1*Others      ......       ...       ... 1 0* Supported by Labour and therefore not included in the &quot; freak &quot; candidate category.- ; ;;:7. Broadcasting.The predominance of the two-party system, which was so marked a feature of the campaign, seems likely to be strengthened by the practice of broadcastingimportant election speeches. On this occasion, by agreement between the Labourand National parties, an election speech, usually delivered from a public platform,was broadcast each night (except Sunday) of the campaign from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.by a selected parliamentary candidate. The 22 broadcasts available were allocatedas follows among the various parties :  ; v;Labour      ...    ....      ... ... ... ... 11National   ...      ...      ... ... ... ... 8Democratic Labour       ... ... ... ... 1Real Democracy Movement ... ... ... 1Independent       ...      ... ... ... ... 1With 19 out of 22 broadcasts, or 20 including the Independent, who for practical purposes may be regarded as Labour, the two older parties under these arrangements enjoy what amounts to command of the air. As the National Partyalso control the press, any new party must depend for a hearing almost entirely on election meetings, which, except as a background for a broadcast, seems bound -as a result of this development to decline in importance, and were, in fact, onthis occasion very poorly attended. .^8. Composition of House of Representatives.Owing mainly to the replacement of a number of elderly Nationalists byyounger members, the present House of Representatives is younger than its predecessor, averaging 53J in age compared with over 57; and the average ageof the National party has been reduced to 51 compared with Labour&apos;s 55. as usual, the predominant elements in the House are ex-trade union officials,1 whocompose 20 out of the 41 European Labour members; and farmers, who compose20 out of 35 National members. Only three Labour members are or have beenconnected with the land and no Labour member now sits for a predominantlyfarming constituency. The elderly, urban and trade unionist character of theLabour party is reflected in the Ministers, most of whom are on the wrong sideof 60, and. nine of whom have at one time been trade union officials. Taken inconjunction with the extra-parliamentary influence exercised, not alwaysdiscreetly, over the Ministry by a group of powerful trade union leaders,^ it iseasy to understand the accusation which is constantly made, that the Labourparty stands for the government of the country by the towns, and largely by a trade union oligarchy, without understanding of or sympathy for the greatprimary industries, on which not only the prosperity but the whole economic structure of New Zealand depends. -:i -[26973] .     b 2
9. Character of Election Campaign. &apos; * .n.*Apart from a somewhat half-hearted and wholly unsuccessful attempt by theNational party to win votes by criticising the Government for having &quot; over-committed &quot; New Zealand militarily, and by offering to allow the men on furloughfrom the Middle East to return to civil life instead Of to the army on theexpiration of their leave, neither the war nor the war effort played much partin the election. Not blood, toil, tears and sweat, but prosperity, security and social services were the order of the day. In the words of a commentator in aNew Zealand weekly : 1&quot;Engaged (as we are supposed to be) in an heroic struggle, this is perhaps the most unheroic election that New Zealand has ever experienced.All candidates, so far as I know, are agreed that the fleshpots&apos; appeal is theonly thing that really counts with the New Zealand elector. I did hear onecandidate referring in terms of admiration to &apos; blood, and tears, and sweat.&apos;But, genuine though his admiration was, he admired these things at a healthydistance; and ultimately he subscribed, with his party, to the sacred andall-dominating objective of the full belly.&quot;A case in point is the attitude of both parties to the question of butter rationing:the Government not daring to introduce it till after the election and theOpposition not venturing to say one word in criticism of the delay; both actuatedby fear of the political consequences.10. Post-War-Policies.I enclose a comparative synopsis of the main features of the Labour and national post-war policies as set out in the statements of policy issued by both parties before the election. It will be noted that Labour&apos;s is very like a newedition of the policy of guaranteed prices, housing and public works, largelyfinanced by. Reserve Bank credit, Avhich, as you know, brought New Zealandnearto a financial crisis shortly before the outbreak of the present war. That of theNational party is very similar to the Labour programme; so much so, in fact,that the Prime Minister declared in his election address that he found little to quarrel with in Mr. Holland&apos;s statement of policy, which he described as atypical example of the traditional Tory practice of stealing other people&apos;s clothes.For the rest, Labour relied on the old story that the National party, by itsdeflationary policy, was responsible for the sufferings of the people of NewZealand during the slump of 1931-35; while the National part)&apos; made play withthe war-time inconveniences at present experienced by the civilian population,which is attributed to the &quot;intolerable system of State dictation, bureaucraticinterference, and departmental inefficiency&quot; imposed on the country by theLabour Government. In short, the main theme of the Labour party in 1943, asin 1938 and 1935, was that the National Government were responsible for thelocal consequences of the world depression; and that of the National party wasthat the Labour Government were responsible for the local consequences of theworld war. The effectiveness of the former may perhaps be estimated by the substantial majority of the total votes polled by Labour; and of the latter bythe divergence already referred to between the civilian vote, to which it was primarily directed, and the service vote, which was less accessible and susceptible to this type of propaganda,11. FuUire Outlook.The election presented the familiar spectacle of both parties submitting-competitive tenders to the electorate, who in awarding a further three years&apos;contract to Labour have, I think, been mainly influenced not by the promises of the parties, between which there was little to choose, but by recollection of past performance. The National party leaders profess, I think sincerely, to be relieved that it is Labour and not themselves that will be faced with theresponsibility for the job of post-war reconstruction. They confidently anticipate that this will speedily lead to a recurrence of the financial difficulties from whichthey believe that Labour was only extricated by the war, and that the next general election will see the end of Labour&apos;s long reign. But how they will dealwith the situation in which they expect Labour to have left the country&apos;s financesthey appear to have no very clear idea. The truth seems to be that both parties are caught in an irresistible current of ever-increasing State expenditure on social
security, and that both are gambling on a series of good years to. see them through their own term of office.12.
