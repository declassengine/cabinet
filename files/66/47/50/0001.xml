THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  March 1944.SECRET. / Copy No. 2W.P. (44) 150.6th March, 1944.WAR CABINET.INFORMATION FROM THE SOVIET UNION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues may be interested to see the annexed extracts from a report,dated the 31st January, recently received from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in moscow.A. E.Foreign Office, 6th March, 1944.ANNEX.1. The Pravda Rumour. As reported in Embassy telegram No. 169 of the21st January, the Pravda rumour about the British separate peace move was widely broadcast on the local Soviet radio on the 17th January, the day of its publication, spreading alarm and despondency amongst the populace. School-children returned home saying that their teachers had told them that GreatBritain bad abandoned the Soviets in favour of Poland. Servants of the british embassy and the Military Mission staffs expressed their fears that Anglo-soviet relations were about to be severed and that they would thereupon be sent toconcentration camps in Siberia. Some intelligent Russians, connecting the storywith, the news in late December of Sir Oswald Mosley&apos;s release, which hadunfavourably impressed them at the time, persuaded themselves that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, supposedly under the influence of &quot; defeatist&quot; and &quot; Fascist&quot;elements, must in fact be contemplating some deal with Germany; others crediteda fantastic report that separate peace negotiations were on foot to prepare theway for Polish troops in Great Britain to go through Germany to reinforce theGerman-Polish frontier against the Soviet Union; others again advanced the theory that the Soviet Government had deliberately put out the rumour in orderto obtain some positive assurance from His Majesty&apos;s Government which wouldallay lingering doubts about the date for the opening of a second front. It wasalso argued by Russians that the Soviet Government would not be averse tocreating tension between themselves and His Majesty&apos;s Government as a meansof enabling them to settle the Polish question as they wished.The net result of the above-mentioned fevered speculation about the rumour,which appeared to be universally believed owing to its publication in the partyorgan, was seriously to cloud the atmosphere of popular goodwill towards GreatBritain resulting from the Moscow and Tehran Conferences, and to revive second front gossip in many quarters. The harm thus produced was partially undoneby the publication in the newspapers on the 19th January of the official denialbroadcast on the B.B.C. The effect was, however, somewhat spoilt by the omission of the last sentence of our denial, and by the fact that the newspapers also reported on the same page extracts from a message on German peace feelers telegraphedfrom Angora by the local correspondent of the Sunday Times. Furtherreassurance was given to the general public by the friendly reference to allied co-operation in the address which M. Shcherbakov delivered on the 21st Januaryin the Hall of the Supreme Soviets before a meeting there of dignitaries assembledto commemorate the 20th anniversary of Lenin&apos;s death. It was also gratifyingto hear from an Intourist worker that, on the day ,of the appearance of the Pravddrumour, a party representative had declared, in a speech before a current meetingof the Intowrist staff, that the rumour was, of course, a German provocation andunworthy of credence, not only because of the assistance which the British were12299   [27055]
giving to the Soviet war effort in the way of supplies and R.A.F. raids on germany, but also because of the fact that joint operations against the enemy had been decided at Tehran.The latest indications are that public anxiety aroused by the Pravda storyhas now subsided. On the other hand, the average Russian, to the extent to whichhe is interested in political questions, continues to harbour serious suspicions ofour good faith and is inclined to be apprehensive about our attitude on thePolish question. In particular, it is thought that we wish to see a settlementof the Soviet-Polish frontier on lines which conflict with the Soviet standpoint.As an illustration of the nervous excitement which the rumour provokedmention may be made of the fact that on the 21st January members of the Pravdaand Izvestiya editorial staffs telephoned to the secretary of The Times correspon-dent to enquire whether there was any truth in the report that the Second front had opened in Western Europe. When answered in the negative they insisted on calling at the office of The Times correspondent to listen in person to B.B.C.broadcasts on his wireless set. Lastly, two amusing footnotes may be relatedon the Pravda story : (a) The joke is now current in Moscow that Great Britain and the soviet union are about to negotiate a separate peace between themselves.(b) On the 17th January an old woman on a tram was overheard toexclaim : &quot;So the British and Germans are now negotiating peace and the war will soon be over.&quot;2. A Russian General voices his hatred of the Germans. A. Russian general who bad recently visited various sectors of the front discoursed on the30th January about atrocities perpetrated by German soldiers on Soviet citizensand their wanton destruction of towns and villages. He then exclaimed : &quot; AllGermans are alike, and prisoners we have captured have the effrontery to say &apos; weare making war on the Soviet Union because it is allied with England.&apos; &quot;3. Conditions at Kiev. The New York Times correspondent said thatduring his visit to Kiev at the end of November he was struck by the comparativelack of damaged buildings. He bad gained the impression that such damage ashad occurred was not of recent date and might well have been due to demolitionscarried out by the Russians themselves after evacuating the city in 1941. Themain buildings destroyed were hotels which had served as German Headquartersduring the early days of the occupation.He incidentally related that when the correspondents visited a nunnery inthe neighbourhood of Kiev, which had been occupied by German officers, the negrocorrespondent of the Daily Worker hopefully enquired of one of the nuns whether there had been any cases of raping. He appeared somewhat crestfallen when thenun replied : &apos;&apos; Oh, no; nothing like that. The Germans here were very wellmannered; they even took their hats off when entering the chapel.&quot;4. A Russian woman&apos;s views on the Red Army&apos;s plan of compaign. Inrecent talk with American correspondents an intelligent Russian womanremarked that although &apos;&apos; not in the confidence of the authorities &apos;&apos; she thoughtit possible that the Red Army would halt when it reached the 1939/41 frontiersand that it would be left to the British and the Americans to settle what shouldbe done with the Germans in Germany itself. She also remarked that letters ofGerman soldiers which came into the hands of the authorities, no less than theadmissions of prisoners whom they captured, showed that our bombing was having a very lowering effect on enemy morale.5. Pride in Soviet achievements. A young woman of bourgeoise originremarked that before the war she had been proud of all that the authorities had done to build up heavy industry and had been ready for patriotic reasons to bear the resulting privations. She had lost faith during the early phase of the war when the Germans had advanced to the outskirts of Moscow. Her confidence hadrevived however with the successes of the Red Army, and she was now exceedinglyproud of being a Soviet citizen.6. In talk with a member of the Embassy, Mr. Maurice Hindus, thebilingual correspondent of the New York Herald Tribune and the Toronto Star,remarked that Russians of his acquaintance were filled with confidence at theircountry&apos;s successes, and determined that after the war the Germans should bekept in a permanent state of subjection. He foresaw, thanks to their new foundconsciousness of strength, that the Soviet Government would adopt an increasinglyuncompromising line in their dealings with the allies.
