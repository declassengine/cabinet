United. States Demands for Australian Meat.Minute,   py the Minister of Food. -   ,-..;1. At a recent meeting of the Far Cabinet you asked.me toreport on.;the&apos;.extent and scale of U.S. demands for Australian meat.2.    &apos; Australia and New Zealand&apos; must be considered together for &quot;this purpose;. . .The Combined Food Board is at present trying to obtain &apos; ;&quot;firm estimates of U.-S. Army -requirements of meat in the southern dominions.   &quot;The-size of &quot;requirements&quot; has ,constantly increased,, buthitherto we have never been able to obtain-firrav-figures agreed between, General MacArthur. and the. Far Department&quot; in-Washington..&quot;  ,&apos;; . Although; ^the Australian . Government has at presentallocated. only v some 100,000 tons of. meat, to the American;. Farces,.&apos;-.,the American, requirements which -&apos; are put forward for the .&apos;y.ea.t 1944 -are as follows: - &quot;;. &quot; -     ,     J . L. -.       -r Australia : /    ..-    208,000 tons- New Zealand.    ..&apos;   &apos;   92^000 tons-   ,- &apos;    300,000 tons ;This would be sufficient for more than 3,000,000- British soldiersin an overseas theatre.    It would be sufficient to feedeachAmerican in the Pacific areas (assuming their numbers not   to exceed500,000) with some 4 lbs.  of meat a day. -3.      .  .&quot;&apos; General-Marshall once admitted to me..unofficially in washington that the&apos;-American. Army-meat.! ration/was too large.    Hewas not himself prepared to face&quot; the.; issue, of;: reducing it, as ithad been approved by Congress; but he promised&apos;to take steps tosee that.the full ration&apos;Was not issued if it were not reallyneeded.    If this.is being done, rthe War Department must be amassingvery large&apos; stocks.;.of; meat.    The:::American civilian agencies arepowerless . to curb, this or even-obtain accurate;: information about its fextienifv!&apos;    tj&apos;1  -Vv \ . &apos;\  ,&quot; &quot; * &apos;:  &apos;It &apos; In the U.K. we&apos; shall --require in 1944 &quot;1,1.45,000 tons of imported meat if-we.are to maintain our present service rations andthe civil one of l/2dV per person per week. &apos;,&apos;&apos;If the above mentionedrequirements of the American Army are fully met out of southern dominions - supplies-j + v/ith.. a . corresponding reduction in the supplies available for the U. K. - from that area;,,- we shall need, at least360,000 tons of frozen meat, from the United States - about 75%more than we received .from the U.S.A. in 1943* &apos;. rThe, Americans haveprovisionally allocated 320,&apos;QOO. tons -against&quot; these -requirements.-?\ .       .. From the attached &apos; table of &quot;imports&quot; in &quot;&quot;recent years (Annexit is&quot; clear:- )(a)--that- our:-supplies, from- australian ^ia^-and New -Zealand havefallen off rap idly.-&apos; : &quot;&quot;This? - is largely&apos;-.&apos;&quot;.P-ue to the presenceof the American soldiers;/(b)
(b)    that our dependence on the United States has increased  .substantially.6. The table attached as Annex B shows that the Americansoldier fares a good deal better than the British for meat..    Ibelieve that at home in. the United States the American soldierreceives 13. 6 ounces per clay including bone, which is almost exactly half as much again as the British soldier in the UnitedKingdom.    As is apparent from the table-the Australians are notin a good position to criticise the size of the American ration. -7. Such meat as the American Army really needs, in the pacific should of course be obtained from local sources.    Thealternative would involve gross misuse of refrigerated shipping.But the present requirements appear to be absurdly inflated.My experience in Washington showed me that no one belowthe President has  any&quot; control over the U. S.  soldiers; and the chance of the President being persuaded to insist upon a formalreduction in U. S. Army ration scales at the present time is nodoubt slight.   ,But it must surely be possible to reduce the amountof neat that the United States Authorities are apparently demandingin addition to the quantities required to&apos; meet the ration scales.It was daily brought to my notice in Washington what precise andintricate detail (especially as to end .use) the American agenciesdemand of any applications made by us or. by the Dominions forarticles under&apos;Lend Lease.    There is therefore no reason why theAustralian and New&apos; Zealand Governments ^should not make similarrequests in regard to the demands made on them for Reciprocal Aidby the American Services, and if they were to do so in the case of meat supplies they, would I am convinced find that the U.S. Army isdemanding meat far in. excess of the quantities needed to maintain their present forces in that area even on the existing ration scales. . ,&apos;&quot;   &apos; - 1        &apos; &apos;i i&quot;.... * * :   * &apos;8. Conclusions(a). &quot;As the next step, I&quot; suggest, that we-and the-       &quot;Australians should now tell the Americans that weare bound to act on the following principle, and weshould ask them to agree its palpable good sense:-The quantity of meat (and dairy products too)-.k     that can be made available for the U. S.  Army in the pacific areas must depend on the quantity that theUnited States actually make available for export tothe United Kingdom.in order to maintain the presentU.K. army and civilian rations.    To the extent thatthe United States fail to supply us with the requiredquantity, we must take more from the Southern Dominions-and if necessary reduce proportionately the quantitysupplied to their Army.,&apos; &apos;      &apos;V For example, to the extent that the U.S.  fail tosupply the U. K.. with the required 360,000 tons of meat.   - in 13kk,&apos; we must draw additional quantities of meat from the Southern Dominions, leaving for the Americans,&apos;) proportionately smaller quantities than the 300,000 tons at present demanded by them. * ;I should;instruct Brand (the U.K. representative on the Combined Pood Board) to explain this principle to the Americans forthwith and if possible secure their/agreement
