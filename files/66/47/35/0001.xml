(i^Lv tx&amp;ji  $Lljs-li&amp;ib&apos; ( fST-fy^JJ*iTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY5 S GOVERNMENT--   109The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of........i//^r^^ipi...............&apos;TjofSSSL^BESSEL copy no.V/.p.(UH-) 1352 6TH FEBRUARY,  19kkWAR CABINET&apos; BEEP TUBE SHELTERSMemorandum by the Home Secretary and Ministerof Home SecurityEight of these shelters have been constructed, four north of the River (Goodge Street, Chancery Lane, Camel en Town andBelsize Park)  and four south (Stockwell, Clapham North,Clapham Common and Clapham South).      Each shelter consists oftwo main parallel tunnels which are below the level of the Tuberailway and which are linked at five points by cross passages.Each tunnel is designed to accommodate about 8,000 people.Of these eight shelters one (Goodge Street) is in theoccupation of military staffs  (one half by the United states army,  the other by the Supreme Allied Command).      Two others(Chancery Lane and clapham Common) are being adapted as citadelaccommodation for essential operational staffs of GovernmentDepartments in the event of &quot;CROSSBOW&quot;;    in these two cases,the upper floors have been cleared of bunks and work on the installation of communications and the fitting up of the topfloors for office purposes is in hand.The remaining five shelters are fully bunked, to accommodate about d0,000 in all.      A section of the Stockwellshelter (1,000 bunks) is occuoiel nightly as a hostel-bymembers of the United States Forces and a section (500 bunks)of each of the other four is similarly occupied by members ofour own Forces at week ends owing to difficulties in gettinglodgings.Up till last May the Tube station platforms were equipped with bunks which provided sleeping accommodation for 19,000people, but in consequence of representations made by the .London Passenger Transport Board, which were supported by theMinistry of War Transport,  to the effect that in some casesthe presence of bunks caused serious obstruction to passenger .traffic, the Civil Defence Committee instructed the SeniorRegional Commissioner for London to consider the removal, inorder to improve traffic conditions, of any bunks not in regular use.      As a result of discussions between  the region and the Board a number of bunks were removed and this reduced the bunked capacity of the Tube Station shelters to about17,000.

During the long period of lull,  the resident populationof the station shelters was about 1-1,000, but the recentresumption of - raiding&apos;has resulted in the influx into a few of the Tube Stations of shelterers far in excess of the bunking-capacity.      The number of people resorting to them soon afterblackout and remaining all night has increased to about 25,000and in the case of an &quot;alert&quot; an additional 25,000 seekadmittance.      Most of these leave at the &quot;all clear&quot;.At some of the Tube&apos;Stations, particularly in the southand south-west, congestion has been of such dimensions that many would-be shelterers have had to be excluded and not unnaturally a clamour has arisenP which&apos; has been encouraged bysome sections of the Press, for the opening of the deep sheltersin the same neighbourhood.      The public know of the existenceof these shelters and they cannot understand why, even if theysucceed in gaining admittance to a Tube Station,they have inmany cases to sleep on the floor of the platform whilst thereare thousands of unused bunks in comfortable surroundings inthe deep shelters.      In their anxiety to obtain accommodation in the stations many people have appropriated bunks allotted to ticket holders and not only has friction developed betweenthe new comers and the ticket holders, but ticket holders have in some instances found it impossible to gain entry to thestation.      The presence outside stations, in large numbers, of people unable to get either into the station or into a neighbouring deep shelter known to them to be unoccupied has created an awkward problem for the police and the situationis giving cause for considerable anxiety.      Efforts have beenmade to relieve the congestion at the points concerned by   ,   -transferring people by train to other stations,  the accommodation in-which is not severely taxed, but, apart fromthe fact that shelterers are loath to respond to appeals tothis end, this expedient is not possible if an &quot;alert&quot; occursafter traffic has ceased for the nightsHitherto requests for the opening of the deep sheltershave been refused on the ground that they were constructed toserve as a reserve to be taken into use only when, by reasonof the. intensity and frequency of enemy raiding, pressure on other shelter accommodation made such a step necessary.     -The    .accommodation in the deep shelters &apos;was provided in anticipation of a continuance of the need felt at the end of 19^4-0 for sheltersin which people could spend the whole of the night.      The recentraiding has been of an entirely different type, and the deepshelters do not provide suitable t^rotection for the short sharptype of raid which has been experienced during the last ten days. ;-&apos;P;More recently .a fresh factor has arisen in the shape of thenecessity to ensure the maintenance of the machinery of   &apos;AgGovernment in the event of the materialisation of &quot;CROSSBOW&quot;.As already indicated, two of the shelters are in process ofbeing adapted for the accommodation of operational staffs, butllilthe Civil Defence Committee agreed at its meeting on the 31stDecember lasti that, at any rate for the time being, it would,,be desirable to reserve all the deep shelters and.not&apos;onlythe two which it was then thought might be required;      theDefence Committee (Operations) at their meeting on the 22ndDecember, 191+3.,  (D,0. (1+3)  1+th Meeting) decided that in theallocation of accommodation in deep tube shelters priority-must be given to the maintenance of the machinery ofGovernment.      If it were decided to open one or two of the

Illshelters in connection with the raiding new being experiencedthere is little doubt that there would be such a demand forthe opening of all the shelters  that it would then be necessaryto give some explanation of the discrimination.      the uncertainty as to the materialisation of an attack by rocketsmakes it difficult to give convincing reasons to &quot;the public in this country, without materially assisting the enemy.      If,after the shelters,  or some of them, had been opened to thepublic,, operational needs arose for protected accommodation of this kind, it would be impossible to deny the use of themto the public.From the point of view of the shelter accommodation available in the London Region,  there is no need to take theseshelters into use.      Publicly provised shelter has been madefor nearly 7-,000&apos;,000 people, of which five and a half million is domestic shelter (Anderson shelters, domestic surface &apos;.&quot;shelters, bo.sements, Morrison shelters and closes or passages).Acquiescence in the doctrine that the public are entitled to expect the most comfortable form of shelter possible, under present short term raiding conditions, will encourage the.argument prevalent in some quarters that people cannot reasonably be expected to go out to Anderson shelters,  surface shelters ontheir own-premises or communal shelters in the streets, in which&quot;they have been allocated places.The spreading of the -deep shelter mentality is a thing tobe avoided.      Fire Guards and other Civil Defence workers are doing magnificent work and in my view it would be wrong thatcurrency should be given to the doctrine that the government recognised that it is a proper thing that people should goto deep shelter and are -prepared to cater for.those who areprone to seek this form of protection.      But if it is decided not to open the deep shelters, it is, in my view, essentialthat the public should be given some explanation of the reasons which have prompted this decision.      I feel sure that such an explanation -would remove the feelings of puzzlement and evenresentment    which.are being exhibited by considerable numbersof London residents.I recommend, therefore,  that^the deep shelters should not he opened to the public and request authority to issue astatement to the effee  &quot;That^ the Government&quot;&quot;nave come to&quot; thisdecision on the ground that the shelters may be needed for essential operational purposes in connection with the forth-coming offensive.It is, of course, open to the Cabinet to decide that three, four or five deep shelters should be opened forthwith,if we feel satisfied that the accommodation which is being held in reserve v/ill not be required for operational purposes.But we must face the fact that, if we -so decide and unexpecteddevelopments of &quot;CROSSBOW&quot; or in other directions create a newdemand for specially protected accornmodat%o\\, it will not bepossible to meet it by removing the existing occupants who willhave acquired squatters&apos; rights.      Nor will there be anyreserve to meet still stronger demands from possibly moredeserving sections of the public in the event of such-developments or if raiding increases or creates the conditions to meet which the deep shelters were constructed.(Intlld.)
