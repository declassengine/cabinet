THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 137.29th February, 1944NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN FOR A FURTHER EXCHANGEOF CIVILIANS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I regret to report that a deadlock has been reached in our negotiations, with japan for a second exchange of civilians, following on that of 1942.2. The numbers affected in this exchange are 1,600 British and Alliedcivilians out of a total of some 17,000 remaining in the Far East. In the caseof Hong Kong, where food conditions are extremely bad and are rapidlydeteriorating, 600 persons were to be repatriated out of some 2,500.3. If the negotiations break down, these British and Allied civilians will suffer, no relief will be brought to the serious Hong Kong situation, and theprospects of sending by exchange ship further supplies of medicines, food and clothing for British and Allied prisoners of war and civilian internees in theFar East will- be seriously prejudiced. This latter fact is perhaps the mostimportant, for in the absence, as matters at present stand, of Japanese agreement to relief supplies from outside being sent to prisoners of war and internees in anyother way, exchange ships represent the sole opportunity of carrying such supplies.From this point of view the United States Government have expressed theirdirect interest in the British exchange operations, and in this they are justified,since at the Red Cross Conference held in Washington towards the end of 1943,agreement was reached for the pooling, as between the British commonwealth and the United States, of all arrangements for the despatch of relief supplies to the Far East, and a projected third American civilian exchange operation hasbeen held up by Japanese insistence on prior satisfaction in regard to certain matters, particularly alleged attacks by the American forces upon Japanesehospital ships.4. The reason for the present deadlock in regard to the British exchangeis as follows : At the end of July 1943 the Australian Government reported that among the 1,600 Japanese civilian internees selected by the Japanese Governmentfor repatriation were some 330 pilots and pearl divers who had been resident inAustralia up to the outbreak of the Far Eastern war and had been employed on ships (not necessarily Japanese ships) around the Australian coast. These menthe Australian Government claimed to be merchant seamen who should thereforebe treated as if they were prisoners of war and as such ineligible for a civilianexchange. The British Commonwealth treat merchant seamen as if they wereprisoners of war (except in certain minor respects) and a notification to that effecthad already been conveyed to the Japanese Government; the latter, however, neveraccepted this view, and when faced with the Australian Governments interpreta-tion of it, as applied to the 330 Japanese in question, contested the right of theAustralian Government to act in this way.5. Since this difference of view threatened to bring about a deadlock in theexchange negotiations, the Australian Government were asked, through the HighCommissioner for Australia, whether they would not agree to disregard the classification of these 330 seamen as prisoners of war and include them in there patriation. The Australian Government replied that they could not do this,on account of the specialised knowledge possessed by these men of * operationalwaters, and also because of their value in salvaging operations. This decision12292   [27010]/ . &apos;        - - f\   / Copy No. tVWAR CABINET.
was later emphatically endorsed by General Mac Arthur. The australian government view therefore was, after further consideration by the departments in London, accepted and the Japanese Government were invited to replace the330 men by an equal number of Japanese civilians held in the BritishCommonwealth.6. Towards the end of the year, the Japanese Government replied maintain-ing their claim for the 330 seamen and stating that this question constituted forthem an essential condition of the exchange. In reporting this the Swiss ForeignOffice added that in their opinion nothing would make the Japanese change their minds on this point. Further correspondence with the Australian&apos; Governmenthas shown that they, too, will not alter their own view, the more so since it has again been strongly endorsed by General MacArthur, who has represented thatthe 330 men would, if released, prove to be of the greatest value to Japanesenaval forces now conducting operations in the waters of the South-West Pacific,and indeed that, in the absence of adequate hydrographic charts, the totalinformation in their possession which would be made available to the JapaneseNavy if they returned to Japan would be superior to that possessed by theAllied naval forces. The State Department in Washington have indicated toHis Majesty&apos;s Embassy there that they may ask General MacArthur to reconsiderhis view.7. Meanwhile, the Swiss representative in Tokyo has been informed by theJapanese Minister for Foreign Affairs that the question of a civilian exchange isno longer regarded as urgent, since the Japanese exchange ship has had to bereturned to the Japanese Navy. A reply has also been received to the australian government- s latest communication to the Japanese Government, but this replymerely restates, in effect, the Japanese view and makes no concrete suggestionseither for continuing or breaking off the negotiations.8. I have considered whether any further step could usefully be taken byHis Majesty&apos;s Government in order to bring the parties to these negotiationsnearer to agreement. We are undoubtedly in a weak position. Our need for an exchange is urgent, since conditions in the Far East are worsening and, as hasbeen explained, this is the only method by which it is at present open to us tosend relief supplies to our prisoners of war and civilians there. The JapaneseGovernment on the other hand demand a high price, namely the surrender of seamen who in the opinion of the highest military authorities on the spot would prove to be of the greatest value to the Japanese Navy. Our motives are primarilvhumanitarian; the Japanese are influenced solely by military considerations. Itis worth mentioning here that suggestions, made to the Japanese some time ago,for an exchange of sick and wounded prisoners were rejected.9. The only proposal which appears to have any chance of acceptance byall the parties concerned is the following : An exchange on a head for head basis of 1,270 persons in place of 1,600.In order to arrive at the new total, the Japanese Government would relinquishtheir claim to the 330 Japanese in Australia classed as merchant seamen,and His Majesty&apos;s Governments and the Allies for whom they are actingwould, relinquish their claim to 300 British or Allied civilians in Japanesehands, to be selected by the Japanese authorities. It is probable that, if they accepted this solution, the Japanese Government would choose to exclude the 330 from the British internees in Hong Kong, since they know of our special interest in Hong Kong. But the Japanese Government are ratherunlikely to accept any arrangement which does not give them the 330 Japanesepilots and pearl divers for whom they have asked. Even if, however, theydo in fact reject it, His Majesty&apos;s Government will at least have made everyeffort in their power.10    I therefore recommend that I be authorised to seek the concurrence ofHis Majesty&apos;s Governments and the Allied Governments concerned, in proposing. the above solution to the Japanese Government.A.
