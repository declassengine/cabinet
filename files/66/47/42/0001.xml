(44) 41)2nd March, 1944WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 235)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 24th February, to0700 2nd March,1944[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Room.
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Adverse weather has hindered the unloading of supplies at Anzio andhas caused casualties among landing craft.The US. Fleet has continued its offensive against Japanese positions in theCentral Pacific without any naval opposition.A large convoy has reached North Russia with the loss of one destroyer.Four U-boats have been sunk and one possibly sunk.Northern Waters.2. A convoy consisting of 49 ships which was escorted and covered by ships of the Home Fleet (including the Polish cruiser Dragon) has arrived intact in north Russian ports. On the night of the 25th/26th, while the convoy was S.W.of Bear Island, H.M.S. Mahratta, one of the escorting destroyers, was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat.   There were only 16 survivors.Home Waters and North Atlantic.3. On the night of the 24th/25th our coastal forces, after engaging armed trawlers off the Dutch coast, attacked groups of E-boats and damaged two ofthem. On the night of the 26th/27th, coastal forces intercepted a small convoy off Jersey and probably sank a trawler. One M.T.B. attacked a convoy off theFrench coast.On the night of the 24th /25th, about 12 E-boats attacked a southbound convoy off Great Yarmouth. They were driven off by H.M. destroyers Vivien andEglinton. One E-boat was probably sunk and another damaged. On the following night E-boats again operated off the East Coast in the vicinity of a southboundconvoy.  H.M.S. Meynell drove them off and damaged one of them.4. H.M.S. Gould (frigate), while engaged in anti-submarine operations N.E.of the Azores, was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat on the 1st. There were34 survivors.H.M.S. Woodpecker (sloop) which, as reported in last week&apos;s Resume, was torpedoed by a U-boat in the S.W. Approaches, capsized and sank on the 27thwhile being towed to port.  There were 77 survivors.5. The Norwegian S/M Via probably sank two ships in an escorted convoy off the Naze (S. Norway) on the 20th and probably sank a 2,000-ton ship five days later.Mediterranean.6. At Anzio the unloading of supplies has been hampered by the weather and in addition by accurate shelling, which on the 24th caused the Liberty ships to move out of the harbour. During the week ending the 29th, a total of21,882 tons was discharged. In a gale on the 25th, H.M.S. Boxer and three othertank landing ships, 2 cargo ships, and a landing craft were driven ashore in theGulf of Naples; one U.S. L.S.T. became a total loss and Boxer was considerablydamaged. The weather has also caused a number of casualties among tanklanding craft.On the-25th H.M.S. Ingle field&apos; (destroyer) was sunk by a glider bomb: atleast 156 survivors, including the Captain, were rescued. On the 27th an L.S.T.was damaged by near misses during a heavy air raid. Shellfire on the 29th causeddamage to two L.S.Ts. while unloading stores. The U.S. cruiser Philadelphiacarried out a bombardment of enemy artillery on the 27th.7. The Italian cruiser Eugenio Di Savoia, while on passage from port said to Taranto, was mined off Cape Rizzuto (south coast of Italy) on the 29thbut reached port under her own steam.8. In the Adriatic, H.M. destroyers on the 27th shelled Korcula Island.On the 29th, the French destroyers Le Malin and Le Terrible attacked a convoy30 miles N.W. of Zara and sank two cargo ships, an escort vessel and two E-boats.No survivors were picked up.
Bast Indies.9. H.M. S/M Trespasser on the 18th sank an escorted ship of 3,000 tonsoff the Nicobar Islands. ; 1 :  &apos;H.M. S/M Tally-Ho, while on patrol in the Strait of Malacca, sank a cargo ship on the 21st. Three days later Tally-Ho was rammed by a Japanese destroyerbut sustained only slight damage.Pacific.New Guinea.10.   On the night of the 25th/26th M.T.Bs. sank six barges off Madang,New Britain and New Ireland.11. On the 22nd, five U.S. destroyers off Mussau Island (N. of New Hanover)sank a 3,500-ton ship which was carrying 400 air personnel from Rabaul:73 survivors were picked up. Three of the destroyers when S.W. of New Hanoversank a cargo ship, an escort vessel and several barges. They later shelled the airfield on Duke of York Island (off Rabaul). The other two destroyers shelledKavieng under heavy return fire from shore batteries. On the night of the 24th/25th, five destroyers sank a large ship north of New Hanover and subsequentlybombarded Kavieng, starting large fires and silencing gunfire from the shore.Preliminary air reports indicate that one ship was sunk, two others set on fire -and several small craft damaged in Kavieng Harbour. On the following nightfour destroyers operating in S.t. George&apos;s Channel (between New Britain andNew Ireland) shelled Vunapope and Cape Gazelle. Other destroyers sank two small ships S.W. of Kavieng.Reconnaissances of Rabaul show less shipping present than at any time sincethe Japanese occupation. On the 25th there were two U-boats,, three damagedanti-submarine craft, 14 small craft and 308 barges.Solomons.12.   On the night of the 26th/27th M.T.Bs. sank two southbound barges offS.W. Bougainville and probably sank 3 others.Marshalls.13. Since the U.S. attack on the Islands at the beginning of January therehave been no enemy, ships in the area and the movements of the US. Fleet havebeen unrestricted.marinas.14. In attacks by U.S. carrier-borne aircraft on the Japanese air bases onSaipan and palestinian between the 21st and 23rd, 135 aircraft were destroyed for theloss of six U.S. aircraft.  One enemy cargo ship and one patrol craft were sunk.Anti-Submarine Operations.15. Eighteen attacks have been reported, 12 of which were carried out by ships, five by shore-based aircraft and one by carrier-borne aircraft. One of the attacks was made in the Mediterranean, one in the Indian Ocean and one in theEast Indies.U-boats were sunk by a Catalina N.W. of the Lofoten Islands on the 25th andin the S.W. Approaches by H.M.C.S. Waskesiu (frigate) on the 24th, and by H.M.frigates A ffleck and Gore on the 26th. A U-boat was sunk by H.M. ships A nthpnyand Wishart (destroyers) in conjunction with two U.S. Catalinas in the Straitof Gibraltar on the 24th. H.M. S/M TallyrHo possibly sank a U-boat in theMalacca Strait on the 15th.Details have not yet been received of promising attacks in Northern Watersmade by the escorts of the convoy to North Russia.16. During February 82 attacks have been reported; 36 were made by shore-based aircraft, three by carrier-borne aircraft, two by submarines and 41 by surface craft. Twelve German U-boats and one Japanese have been sunk, fourGerman U-boats and one Japanese probably sunk and three German U-boats andone of unspecified nationality possibly sunk.127022] &apos; b
Enemy Intelligence.17. The Hipper is now considered to be effective. The koln appears to bemounting new guns. Further examination of photographs shows that thePrinz Eugen was at Gdynia on the 19th.U-boats.18. There are indications that there were about 12 U-boats south ofBear Island during the passage of the convoy to N. Russia. One or two others mayhave arrived in the Caribbean and about two are patrolling off the West african coast. In the Indian Ocean there are probably two German U-boatsoperating : one of them S.W. of Ceylon. Other German U-boats are thought tobe on passage in the southern Indian Ocean intending to return to theBiscay ports.U-boat construction in Germany up to June 1943 showed a steady increase.Since the summer of 1943 there has been a sharp decline : the total has fallenfrom 271 in June 1943 to 168 in February 1944. This decline is considered to be too general to be due to the effect either of bombing or the blockade, but isattributed to a deliberate policy of reduction.Enemy Attack on Shipping.19.   U-boats are reported to have sunk four ships.In the Mediterranean, a tanker was sunk off the northern Syrian coast. OffWest Africa, two ships in local convoy were sunk off of Takoradi. In the indian ocean, one ship was sunk south of Colombo.One ship in coastal convoy was sunk by E-boats off Great Yarmouth.A provisional figure for shipping losses from enemy action during Februaryis 67,000 tons.  Unconfirmed losses at present total 39,000 tons.Protection of Seaborne Trade.20. During the week ending the 27th, 848 ships in convoy arrived at their destinations. Of these, 257 were in ocean convoys and 591 in British coastal convoys. Six escort carriers, one anti-aircraft ship, 70 destroyers (including18 U.S. destroyers) and 107 sloops, cutters, frigates and corvettes were employedon escort duties.Four homeward-bound convoys, consisting of 97 ships, and four outward-bound convoys, consisting of 160 ships, arrived at their destinations without loss.Allied Minelaying.21.   Surface craft have laid mines off the Dutch and Belgian coasts.Aircraft have laid mines in Kiel Bay, in the Baltic, and off the Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Mines weeping.22. E-boats are suspected of minelaying off the East Coast on two nights ofthe week and off the South-West Coast on one night. No minelaying by enemy aircraft has been reported.The mine totals are 4,687 ground and 4,184 moored.23. In the Mediterranean magnetic mines have been destroyed off Tunisharbour. .Three dangerous areas, due to Italian moored mines, have been declared offthe west coast of Corsica.Enemy Merchant Shipping.24. In ports between Calais and Gibraltar there are now about 293.000 tonsof dry cargo shipping under enemy control, as compared with about 355,000 tons at the end of May 1943. The difference is due chiefly to the sinking of 29,000tons and the passage of 23,000 tons north through the Strait of Dover. Of thepresent total, 114,000 tons are serviceable and 179,000 tons are immobilised.There have been 13 arrivals in Spanish ports and 14 sailings of the small ships engaged in the ore trade.German shippers are finding the lack of suitable tonnage so acute that thetransport of copper from Turkey to Bulgaria is restricted.
Swedish Intelligence.- 25. Reports have been received that, in the middle of March, the normalshore training of the Swedish Navy is to be interrupted in order that the fleet maybe brought to a state of immediate readiness. Six new destroyers and a numberof submarines are, likely to be commissioned.MILITARY SITUATION.The Russo-German Campaign.     (An outline map is included as an inset.)Northern Sector.26. The Russians claim to have forced the River Narva south of the townon the 1st March, and to have formed a bridgehead 22 miles long by nine milesdeep, thus cutting the Narva-Tallinn railway at a point nine miles west of Narva.Towards Pskov they have made good progress astride the railways from north, N.E. and east; on the north they are within six miles of the town and onthe east 10 miles. Further south they advanced on a wide front west of Kholm,clearing the lateral railway Dno-Novo Sokolniki and pushing beyond it at oriepoint to within 10 miles of the railway Pskov-Polotsk. The Germans describethis as disengaging from the Russians in order to shorten their front.Central Sector.27. On the 25th the German News Agency broadcast (for foreign consump-tion only) that Vitebsk had been evacuated. This has not been confirmed byreports from any other source.Further south, in the Rogachev area, the Russians broke through towardsBobruisk on the 24th, capturing Rogachev and advancing- on a 30-mile front upto a depth of 16 miles.In the area just north of Luck the Germans have been attacking bridgeheadsheld by the Russians on the west bank of the River Styr. After some initial successthe German attacks were repulsed.Dnieper Bend.28. In spite of the elimination of the encircled divisions of theirEighth Army, the Germans have continued to attack west of Zvenigorodka;presumably in order to prevent the. Russians regrouping for a new southwardthrust.The Russians have announced that, in addition to the German casualtiesreported in last week&apos;s Resume, the Germans lost 27,000 killed and 1,500prisoners of war in the unsuccessful relieving attacks from the south-west. the fate of the encircled forces has been concealed from the German public, whichwas told that 90 per cent, of these troops had broken out. , -South and S.E. of Krivoi Rog the Russians have kept up their pressure andhave made advances of up to 15 miles south-westwards. Progress has also beenmade west of Nikopol, where the Germans have been forced back from theirsalient.Crimea.   ......29. On the 28th Russian attacks east of Kerch were reported for the first time since the 28th January.General.30. The Russians have had a successful week in the whole of the NorthernSector, where they have made rapid progress towards the Latvian border.Although the Germans have been disengaging under Russian pressure, theirresistance will probably stiffen at Pskov. In addition, a new attack launchedtowards Bobruisk had a good initial success, and remains a threat to the german forces in that area. In the South, the capture of Krivoi Rog has been followedby further progress which has cleared the area south, of Krivoi Rog and. west ofNikopol.&apos; [270221 B 2
Further Russian progress on the Eastern Front will depend to a large extent on the weather.   In a normal year the spring break-up occurs : Break-up begins. Ground dry.(a) Narva-River   Pripet End of March. Mid-May.(b) River     Pripet - linethrough Uman andKrivoi Rog ... End of March. End of April.(c) South of (b) ...       ....    Last week of February. Mid-April.The abnormally mild winter should mean a shorter spring thaw and enableoperations to; continue without much interruption, although frost during thethaw, even if not severe, may delay the break-up, while rain during and afterthe thaw would delay the drying-out process.Italy.31. The early part of the week was comparatively quiet in the two main battleareas, Cassino and the Allied bridgehead. The enemy, however, kept up constant pressure on the left flank of the bridgehead to cover his regrouping for anotherattempt at a break-through. This attack was delivered in considerable strengthearly on the 29th and succeeded in penetrating on a narrow front. The situation was restored by a counter-attack and our forward positions have, in the.main,stood firm.32. In the Eighth Army sector operations have been rather more activethan of late. On the 24th a Canadian Brigade advanced slightly towards Tolloand on the same day an Indian Division was heavily engaged near Arielli. this latter attack was held and finally driven off after casualties had been sustained by both sides. The following day another attack south of this village was broken up by our artillery fire. Since then bad weather has hampered operations andcontact has been maintained by patrols. Large fires were seen in Tollo and to thenorth during the night of the 29th February/1st March and there were signs ofconsiderable enemy movement.33. On the main Fifth Army front regrouping has been carried outthroughout the week. While no fresh attack has developed against the Cassinospur or Mt. Cairo, the enemy has been making continual attempts to infiltrateour forward positions without success. On the 24th the 78th Division, recently arrived from the Eighth Army, took over the sector along the River Rapido southof Cassino. The New Zealanders, who had been holding these positions, thenmoved round to the north of the town. The U.S. divisions, which had beenattacking in this area for over a month, were relieved and are now resting andregrouping near Alife. There have been heavy snowfalls throughout the weekand on the 29th the River Rapido overflowed its banks and the ground to the N.E.of Cassino is flooded for about a mile.34. In the Allied bridgehead the enemy, without developing a thrust of any great strength, kept up his pressure against the British positions north and N.W.of Cantoniera. Attacks were made along the line of the River Mollettathroughout the week and there was some bitter fighting, particularly for the possession of some houses to the west of Cantoniera which the enemy were usingas strong points. It was evident, however, that the enemy was preparing to makeanother determined attempt to break through the outer defences, and this wasborne out by air reports of heavy tank concentrations in and around Cisterna onthe 27th. The expected attack was launched early on the 29th, and this timeagainst the positions held by U.S. forces S.W. of Cisterna. Some ground was lost near Case Carano, but a counter-attack by a U.S. battalion forced theGermans back about a thousand yards and. contact between the forward positionsis being maintained.Continual attempts have been made throughout the week by bombing and long-range artillery to hamper the maintenance and build-up of our forcesthrough the port and beaches at Anzio. E-boats have also made attacks on theanchorage, but have in every case been driven away by our off-shore patrols.Yugoslavia.35. Recent operations in Yugoslavia have, in general, been somewhat,localised by heavy snow.
In Bosnia, fighting has continued east of Sarajevo, where the Partisans statethey have captured Rogatica. Farther west an enemy thrust west of. Banjalukahas been repulsed.On the 20th Tito&apos;s forces made a second attack-on the mercury mine at Idria(35 miles north of Trieste), putting it completely out of action.In Macedonia heavy fighting took place during the first three weeks ofFebruary in the area some 40 miles S.E. of Skoplje. The Partisans inflicted many casualties on the Germans. In the same area they have derailed several trains,including a seventeen-coach express, which overturned complete into the RiverVardar.An unconfirmed report has been received of a battle between Mihailovic forces and the Germans south of Belgrade.Greece.Operations against the enemy.36. A British Liaison Officer, ably assisted by E.L.A.S. forces, carried outthe successful derailment and destruction of a troop train in the Vale of Tempe(S.E. of Mount Olympus). The train is reported to have contained largenumbers of German officers and men on their way north. German casualties havebeen put as high as 900 : a more conservative estimate confirms a minimum of 200.In Macedonia, Bulgarian forces attacked an E.L.A.S. band west of Portolago,but were driven back with some 200 casualties.In the Peloponnese also, E.L.A.S. forces have engaged the Germans and security battalions. Fighting is in progress in the area 15 miles east ofKyparissia and the enemy&apos;s forces have been driven back.Civil War.37. Deadlock appears to have been reached in the negotiations between the opposing factions. Zervas himself met the E.A.M. central committee on the 27th,but preliminary reports show no cause for optimism regarding a settlement.Far East.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Burma.A arakan.38. Our troops have now cleared the Japanese from the Ngakyedauk Passand supplies are reaching the 7th Indian Division, from which all wounded havenow been evacuated.As a result of our strong pressure from the north and west the Japanese areattempting a withdrawal to their original starting positions. These attemptshave been severely harried by our forces and a number of sharp encounters havetaken place.   The mopping-up of enemy parties continues.To date, Japanese casualties in the Arakan battle are estimated at 4.500, ofwhich 1,500 were killed, out of a total force of 10,000 to 12,000.Kaladan.39. West African troops, advancing down the Kaladan River Valley havereached positions some seven miles south of Kyauktaw.Pacific.New Guinea.40. In the coastal sector, Allied, troops have advanced westwards and have secured a bridgehead across the Mot River.Solomons.41. Japanese resistance on Nissan, the largest of the Green Islands, ceasedon the 20th.
Marshall Islands.      i42. Japanese resistance on Eniwetok Atoll ceased on the 22nd; 48 prisoners were taken.Admiralty Islands.43. United States troops landed on Los Negros Island on the 29th after a naval bombardment, and captured the airfield at Momote on the east coast.AIR SITUATION.General Review.44. U.S. heavy bombers, operating from the United Kingdom and fromthe Middle East, maintained a heavy scale of attack on factories associated withthe German aircraft industry.Bomber Command operated in strength against Schweinfurt, Augsburg andStuttgart.Enemy attacks were made on this country.In Italy, support was provided for our land forces.United Kingdom. *45. Three night attacks were made on this country, the approach being over the south coast. In the first raid, 100 enemy aircraft were over land, lessthan half of which reached Greater London&apos;, but no concentration was obtained.In the second, six out of a total of 20 aircraft were over London. The thirdattack was made by 120. enemy aircraft, only ten of which penetrated to the capital and the bombing was widespread and generally ineffective. Fifteen enemy air-craft were shot down by night fighters, four more by Intruders, and three byA.A. guns.The scale of effort by the enemy Western Front bomber force was steadilymaintained, but the number reaching Greater London during recent raids has declined : Date.21/22 ...22/23 ...23/24 ...24/25 ...29/30 ...March 1/2TotalSorties.2515015014030110SortiesOver land.15110100100OA70Sorties overLondon Area.3706040610Home Waters.46. Beaufighters made two effective attacks on a convoy off the dutch coast; after being hit by eight rocket projectiles, a ship believed to be theMaasburg of 6,400 tons went aground off Den Helder where it was, later,torpedoed twice amidships. It is probably a total loss. Three of its escort vessels were damaged.Off Norway, Beaufighters torpedoed and set on fire a medium-sized ship and also attacked a tanker and two other ships.Albacores, patrolling at night, destroyed one minesweeper and damagedtwo others off the French coast.Aircraft of Bomber Command, of which 246 were despatched, laid 464 sea-mines in enemy waters; six bombers are missing and a seventh crashed in thiscountry.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.47. A total of 2,615 heavy bombers of the with U.S.A.A.F. based on theUnited Kingdom and of the XVth U.S.A.A.F. based on the Mediterranean were despatched against targets in Germany and Austria. The following were themore important attacks : 1

Not observed.In the above attacks, in which over 3,000 fighters co-operated, 319 enemy aircraft were destroyed, 61 were probably destroyed and 97 were damaged;133 heavy bombers, 5 per cent, of the total despatched, and 26 fighters are missing.It is probable that the week&apos;s combined effort by TJ.S. and R.A.F. heavy bombers against factories producing and assembling aircraft has had a serious effect upon the enemy&apos;s production; the attacks on the Messerschmitt assemblyfactories at Regensburg and Augsburg, the Daimler Puch aero-engine factory at Steyr, and the glider and fighter aircraft factories at Gotha would appearto have been particularly successful.Military Objectives in Northern France were bombed by a total of 876 aircraft which dropped 1,349 tons; good results are reported from a number of these attacks. The 110 squadrons of fighters, acting as escort and support, met withnegligible opposition. Six Fortresses, one Marauder and three Mosquitoes are missing from these operations and a further six aircraft crashed either in thiscountry or the sea.Attacks by escorted Marauders, of which four are missing, were made on airfields in Northern France and Holland; 432 tons of bombs were dropped onthese targets and at Gilze Rijen, Deelen and Leeuwarden good results are reported.Fighters, on offensive patrols over France, destroyed seven enemy aircraft and two gliders, either on the ground or in the air.Night.48. On three nights of the week, the 24th/25th, 25th/26th and lst/2nd,Bomber Command aircraft carried out heavy attacks on objectives in Germany,the targets being Schweinfurt, Augsburg and Stuttgart.At Schweinfurt, which had been bombed earlier in the day by U.S. heavy bombers, two separate attacks were delivered, the first by 331 aircraft and thesecond, two hours later, by 296 aircraft; a total of 2,152 tons of bombs was dropped. Visibility in the first operation was good and a concentration wouldappear to have&quot; covered the built-up area. Observation by the second force washampered by smoke but, towards the end of the a,attack, the whole town appearedwell covered with fires.. A similar technique, also following a daylight attack by U.S. bombers, was employed against Augsburg, the two night attacks (by 245 and 253 aircraft respectively) being separated by an interval of approximately 2\ hours. At this target, a total of 1,726 tons was dropped in conditions similar to those atSchweinfurt. A conflagration, started by the first attack, was visible to thesecond force over 200 miles away; the latter added to the existing fires.At Stuttgart, 1,675 tons of bombs were dropped by 468 aircraft in a blindbombing attack through thick cloud. No accurate assessment of results is possible,but the glow of many fires, spread over a wide area, could be seen reflected on theclouds.
From the above operations, which involved the despatch of 1,885 aircraft,63 bombers (or 3-46 per cent.) are missing and a further seven crashed in thiscountry.Mosquitoes, of which two are missing, attacked a number of targets inGermany, airfields in France and the Low Countries and, on intruder operations,destroyed three enemy aircraft.Italy,49. Weather conditions during the week were partially unfavourable and operations were considerably curtailed.In the area of the Fifth Army Front including that of the bridgehead, a totalof 1,453 sorties was flown on tactical missions; troops, gun positions and tankconcentrations were effectively attacked by fighter-bombers and light bombers.Enemy activity was on a comparatively small scale and was largely carried outby fighter-bombers operating against our land forces: in combat, 12 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of two Allied aircraft. At night, small numbers of bombers operated against our beachhead and against shipping, causing somecasualties and delay.In central Italy, communications and airfields were attacked. Offensivereconnaissance of the roads in the Aquino-Avezzano and the Palestrina areasresulted in the destruction of 37 M.T. vehicles, while others were damaged. Forty-eight Kittyhawks bombed the term -Teramo area, obtaining hits on railways andin the mouth of a tunnel; Ladispoli harbour (22 miles N.W. of Rome) was successfully attacked by 36 Invaders. Airfields in the Rome area and to thenorth of Rome were attacked, and aircraft on the ground were destroyed.Two heavy attacks on aircraft factories in south Germany were partiallyprevented by unfavourable weather, and Fiume a secondary target was bombed&quot;;the refinery was considerably damaged, the central buildings being burnt out, andthe torpedo factory received at least two hits. In combat, 12 enemy aircraft were destroyed.A force of 132 Fortresses was despatched to attack Pola and hits were obtained..on the Cement Works and in the Naval Yards; owing to cloud someof the aircraft bombed the docks at Zara, Vigorous enemy opposition was encountered and 60 enemy aircraft were destroyed for the loss of 19 Fortresses.Yugoslavia.50. Offensive reconnaissances by fighter-bombers were carried out against shipping off the Yugoslav coast. At least 14 small ships or barges and one vessel of 200 feet were destroyed or seriously damaged. In addition, against landtargets, damage was caused to five locos, 20 railway wagons, two trains, 14 M.T.vehicles and three grounded aircraft.iEgean Sea.51. Attacks on enemy shipping attempting to supply occupied islandsresulted in three small vessels being sunk or seriously damaged; bombs were dropped on the quay at Porto Lago Bay, Leros. Four enemy aircraft were destroyed and four Allied aircraft are missing.Russia.52. The Russian Air Force carried out further raids on Finnish ports thisweek. On the night of the 22nd/23rd February, Asbo was attacked by an unknownnumber of aircraft. The Russians state that many fires broke out and much damage was done. Helsinki was raided again on the night 26th/27th February.It appears that the duration of the attack was approximately ten hours; thereare grounds for supposing that 200-300 aircraft took part in the attack and it.is assumed that the operation was carried out by the Russian Long-range bomber force. The Finns claim to have destroyed 12 Russian aircraft during theoperation.According to the Finns, the port of Oulu was raided on the nights 26th/27thand 27th/28th February.The Russian Air Force continued to provide close-support to land forcesin the line, especially on the northern front, where, in the area of Pskov, much damage is claimed to have been inflicted on German lines of communication and
transport. About 48 enemy aircraft are claimed to have been destroyed on theground as a result of attacks on airfields on the Volkhov and second Baltic frontsduring the course of the week.The weather has Continued to be bad, and has hampered Russian operations,more particularly south of the Pripet Marshes.It is thought that the German Long-range Bomber strength is down to about300 aircraft. This is the lowest figure yet reported for this force and may, to agreat extent, be accounted for by the re-equipping and resting programme nowunder way after the exceptionally bad flying conditions which obtained duringthe winter. This figure should be compared with the estimated strength of500 L.R.B. in February 1943.Burma.53.

On photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on theMesserschmitt works, smoke &quot;Obscures the greater part of the target area, but,where visible, burning buildings are seen to include offices and hangars.In the southern part of the area, damage has been caused to hangars, aircraftshelters and workshops.   Several aircraft are also seen to be damaged.Brunswick. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the20th and 21st February, show severe damage to the M.I.A.G. Neupetritorfactory particularly to the central and S.E. end of the plant. A stores building,several workshops and machine shops, and about half the main factory have been destroyed, and the power station has been heavily damaged.

One building of the town lighting works has been severely,damaged and there are scattered incidents of business and residential damage.Diepholz A airfield.^-Photographs taken on the 24th February, after theU.S.A.A.F. attack on the 21st February, show extensive damage to buildings on thenorthern perimeter and a very heavy concentration of craters on the airfield,including a large number on the runway. Two large hangars, three mediumhangars, a number of storage buildings and some barrack buildings have been destroyed and/or damaged in varying degree. Two open shelters have receiveddirect hits.DusseldorfI Neuss. An immediate interruption of photographs taken onthe 25th February, show that as a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the5th January, the factory of Bauer u. Schaurte priority 2, the leading manu-facturers of bolts in Germany, has been severely damaged. Damage is concentrated round the railway station at the southern end of the marshalling yard, and railway property including one of the main station buildings and alocomotive shed has suffered.&apos;Gotha.  1 An immediate interpretation of photographs taken on the25th February, after the U.S.A.A.F. attacks on the 20th and 24th February,shows that the works of Gothaer Waggonfabrik A.G., a priority 1 target,assembling Messerschmitt twin-engined fighters, has been severely damaged overthe whole of its area.In the locomotive factory area, one large workshop has been destroyed andthree more very severely damaged, while two medium-sized workshops, the mainoffices and several small sheds have been damaged.In the airframe factory area, three large shops have been destroyed and several smaller shops severely damaged.On the airfield, two large and two medium hangars have been damaged -thetwo latter severely and several barrack and office buildings have been destroyed.There are many craters on the airfield and among aircraft parked on the northern and eastern taxi ranks.Leipzig. Photographs which cover the western part of the town but not thebuilt-up area immediately west of the World Fair, confirm that severe damage hasbeen done to the aircraft components factory of Erla Maschinenwerk G.m.b.H. atHeiterblich. The sub-assembly shop and despatch centre, the component erectingshop, two large machine shops, the workshop and the main offices have all been heavily damaged, and the power house and several unidentified buildings have alsobeen affected.In addition, considerable damage has been caused to several industrial premises in the Plagwitz area in the west of the city, and the following inparticular have suffered heavily :&apos; Stohr A.G. priority 2 the largest wool spinners in Europe.Schultz A.G. chemicals.Schelter u. Giesacke A.G. -printing. - .Smaller items of industrial damage have also been caused in the same area and there is more business and residential damage a little further south.Regensburg. Photographs taken after the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the22nd February from Italian bases, show severe damage to the Messerschmittfighter assembly factory at Ober-Traubling to which the assembly facilities hadtransferred after the attack on Regensburg/Prufering in August 1943 by theU.S.A.A.F. &apos; - &apos; ^ &apos;&quot;&apos;Two of the largest buildings of the plant, an assembly shop and asub-assembly shop have been completely destroyed, and one of the two new hangarsat the north-eastern end three-fourths destroyed. At the southern end of the plant another large sub-assembly shop, a stores building and several G.A.F.buildings and workers huts have been damaged in varying degree.Photographs taken on the 26th show the combined attack on the 25th on theMesserschmitt factory to have been extremely successful, resulting in very greatdamage to the plant. All primary and secondary targets are considereddestroyed. At least 22 single-engined fighters were destroyed on the ground andmany more were undoubtedly destroyed and burnt out among destroyed buildings.The surrounding railway, housing estates and flat installations are severely damaged.
Steyr. Photographs taken on the afternoon of the 24th, show the DaimlerPuch Plant to have been severely damaged. The assembly shop roof is partiallyobscured by smoke from a large fire at the east end of the building where the roof has collapsed. Roofing in other parts of this building is also damaged.The foundry of building No. 4 has not apparently received a direct hit but isprobably damaged by blast or near misses as smoke is seen escaping fromdamaged roofing. The main assembly shop is concealed by clouds of smoke fromat least two fires. The large machine-shop is believed to have sustained eightdirect hits and over one-third of the roofing has collapsed. Another machine-shop is partially concealed by smoke from fire at the west side as a result ofone direct hit. Building No. 13 (machine-shop) has received one direct hit andwas on fire. Building No. 14 (machine-shop) is partially concealed by smoke from a fire which has a good hold on the west side. The damaged roof is dimlyvisible through smoke. Building No. 16 (power plant) has been damaged inthe S.E. corner by a near miss. Building No. 17 has five direct hits in the areaof the coal yards.. Several small buildings between the coal yards and generalworkshops are demolished. Building No. 19 (timber workshops) are almostdemolished by five direct hits and three near misses. Several other small buildings are completely demolished and fires are still burning. No interpreta-tion is possible of some parts of the factory which are completely obscured bysmoke.Stuttgart. Additional photographic cover though still partly obscured bysmoke and haze now shows that two more important factories have been sub-stantially damaged. In Daimler-Benz A.G. at Unterturkheim, aero-engine and armaments (Priority 1) the power-house, and the new foundry have been damaged,one stores building has been destroyed and another damaged, and the repairs and inspection buildings and the foundry have been damaged or partly destroyed.In the ball-bearing works at Vereinigte Kugeliager Fabrik G.m.b.H. BadCannstadt (Priority 1), the main block of buildings has been damaged.Photographs of the Vereinigte Kugeliager Fabrik G.m.b.H. taken shortly after the attack by U.S.A.A.F. on the 25th February, are half-obscured by smoke from fires still burning, but damage to the works is seen to be severe, several large buildings having been wholly or partly destroyed.
