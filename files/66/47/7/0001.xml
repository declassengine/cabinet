(44) 70) of the 2nd February and to the War Cabinet Conclusionsof the 9th February (W.M.

E.Foreign Office, 14th February, 1944.Record of Conversation between United States Counsellor and Sir A. Cadogan.The Counsellor of the United States Embassy called on me this morning and left with me the annexed message from the United States Secretary of State to theAustralian and New Zealand Prime Ministers. Mr. Bucknell asked me whether could give him any guidance as to the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom.I told him that, while welcoming the conclusion of the Australian-NewZealand agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom had them-selves had misgivings about the advisability of calling an early conference ofPowers with territorial interests in the South and South-West Pacific to considerthe problem of regional security and related matters.I did not know whether His Majesty&apos;s Government would be expressing these doubts to the Australian and New Zealand Governments, but I thought it safe tosay to him that these doubts existed and that, therefore, we viewed the matter in very much the same way as the United States Government.A.

Annex.The following is text of a message dated the 1st February, 1944, from theSecretary of State to Prime Minister Curtin and to Prime Minister Fraser : . uvi/i v. I have read the text of the Australian-New Zealand agreement,of the21st January expressing the views of the two Governments on certain mattersof common interest relating particularly to the south and south-west Pacific-region. I am, of course, aware that this arrangement, in so far as it under-takes to deal with matters affecting territories other than those of the two.Governments, is wholly without prejudice to the interests of other countries.I am certain that both the Australian and New Zealand Governments arelikewise aware of this and that they have no desire to affect the interests ofother countries prejudicially.It is understandable that Australian and New Zealand governments should wish to reach agreement between themselves on matters of common, , .. concern and that they should wish to make their views known to other&apos;Kn governments.   I am frankly disturbed, however, at the proposal of the twoGovernments to call an early conference of powers with territorial interestsin the south and south-west Pacific to consider the problem of regionalsecurity and related matters.   I have discussed this with the President andt5 , while we agree that these matters must be given utmost attention we have^3onsiderable doubts that it is yet time for discussing them at a formal1     conference of interested powers.   Our doubts have, I believe, already beenHrn communicated informally to the Australian Government.   Despite all&apos; theV v. progress we have made the war in the Pacific has still to be won and in ourr.^, opinion it has not yet reached the stage which would warrant the type of&quot;formalised discussions which appear to be contemplated.There is also the question of approach which should be carefully considered,   In our opinion it is necessary to agree upon arrangements fora general international security system before attempting to deal with\ problems of regional security.   Any attempt to deal with regional security in the south-west Pacific in advance of - agreement on a general securitysystem might well give rise to efforts on the part of other regional groups to make endeavours in exclusive arrangements for security.   Thus such a&quot;&quot;^conference as is proposed might in the end result in a number of independentregional systems and seriously interfere with efforts to achieve a general V system of world security.!        We have also to consider the effect of such a conference upon our     immediate war effort.   The President and I have some fears that a formal:&apos;    conference of the interested Powers for the purpose contemplated would possibly do more harm than good to our united war effort.  Such a conference might well arouse suspicions and possibly bring into focus conflicting opinionson matters which do not require decision at this time.   We are sure you,   share our strong feeling that nothing should be done at this time to impairexisting harmony among all the United Nations fighting together against our common enemies.: We hope therefore that you will not take any steps toward calling such&apos;:     a conference until we have had an opportunity to discuss these matters fully\together&apos; personally.   I understand that you may be coming to Washington. within the next month or two.   The President and I look forward withpleasure to-seeing you at that time and believe that your visit will give us an excellent&apos; opportunity for a full and frank exchange of views on all these problems.&quot;In a further exchange of messages between the Secretary and the PrimeMinister of New Zealand regarding the suggestion that a conference be heldon questions affecting the south and. south-west Pacific, the Secretary expressed his pleasure over the Prime Minister&apos;s agreement with American views on thissubject but pointed out that the Prime Minister apparently believed that wewould agree to such a conference after discussions had been held in Washington.The Prime Minister was informed that in the view of the American Governmentno attempt to call a conference of the type contemplated should be made in thepresent year.
