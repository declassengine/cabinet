THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTYOF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet,  March 1944.. 36162SECRET.Copy JNpW.P. (44) 148.6th March, 1944.WAR CABINET.DISCUSSIONS UNDER ARTICLE VII OF THE MUTUAL aid agreement:  MONETARY POLICY.1. The Bank of England take the view that the Monetary Plan is, in fact,the Gold Standard, subject to the 10 per cent, spread and certain limitations asto capital movements.2. The Bank of England put forward, a memorandum (E.E.P. (44) 3) whichin section 3 provides for a provisional rate between sterling and the dollar. Ithas been said that this section, in effect, sets up a Gold Standard. Nothing ofthe sort. It is a working rate very much as at present, and at practically thesame price of 4 dollars.3. There is a vital distinction between the Monetary Plan put forward bythe Minister of State and. the proposal made by the Bank of England in their memorandum. Under the Plan, there is an obligation of convertibility. Underthe Bank&apos;s project, there is no such obligation.4. The Bank take the view that it is essential to sustain and strengthenfaith in sterling. To do so, the Sterling Area must be persuaded to believe in itsown currency. Any doubt or misgiving will result in a flight from sterling, withholders trying to sell for any other currency.5. If we keep faith in sterling, the Bank believe that it is possible, although not easy, to sustain the Sterling Area in future, in the face of the debit balances in India and Egypt.6. So it is right for me to say that I am entirely in agreement with theBank. I support their project. I look with horror on the alternative Planbecause it destroys the Sterling Area and results in the freezing of sterling balances throughout that Area. This is all to be done at the compulsion of a fund in Washington. Many consequences will flow, one of which will be a black market in sterling.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S. W. 1,6th March, 1944.[27051];v1
