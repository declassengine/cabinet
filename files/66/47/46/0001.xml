(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAH3SIIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERN1VIENT)SECRET COPY NO.     ^ UW.P.(44)146. jfith March,  1944. 1 157WAR GABInA.WAGE STRUCTURE OF THE COALMINING INDUSTRY.Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Fuel aiad Power.1.     This morning I submitted to the Lord President&apos;s Committeea memorandum (L.P,(44)47) asking for authority to lay certain proposals &quot;before representatives of the Mining Association andthe Kihe-workers&apos; Federation on Wednesday next, 8th March, whenthey meet me to discuss the overhaul of the wage structure of the coalmining industry.    My objects are:-(a) To bring about a closer relation between wages and output;  and(b) To give to the mineworkcrs a greater sense of security for the future.12,      To achieve these aims I propose that:-(i) The existing flat rates amounting to 4/6d. per &quot;shift,now payable to all classes of mineworkers, should be&apos;merged in the case of piece workers into the piece workrates by means of an appropriate percentage increase&apos; in tonnage or yardage rates in each district.(Note. This proposal, which is designed to increasethe incentive of men on piece rates, who are the productive workers, would take the place of earlier proposals for a personal attendance or pit outputbonus.)(ii) These revised rates and the existing minima should becontinued &quot;by an agreement between the two sides of theindustry until December, 1947, at which date it wouldbe possible for either side to give six months&apos; noticeof amendment or termination of the agreement.3.     These proposals will involve an undertaking by theGovernment to continue for the period stated (a) if the needarises, a system of financial pooling such as that now providedby the Coal Charges Account and (b)  in any event, continuedGovernment control of the price of coal at a level which would ensure a reasonable credit balance for the industry.4.      The implementation of the proposals in this paner involves thecontinuance of part of the present system of war-time control toa date when the Government&apos;s powers under the Emergency Powers(Defence) Acts may have expired.    The Lord President&apos;s Committee,which approved my proposals, accordingly invited me to ask theWar Cabinet for authority to give the required undertaking onbehalf of the Government.Ministry of Fuel and Power,7, Mi1lbank, S.W.1.G.li.
