IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  February 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 109.Copy No.15th February, 1944.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED OIL CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.Lord Halifax&apos;s telegram No. 696 shows that a most serious situation has developed.- 2. The American list of topics which they wish to discuss at the proposedOil Conference makes it plain that they intend to demand a large share of our 3. An inspired article in the American press indicates that the Americansmean to take of our Kuweit oil and to ask for a share of ourIraq supplies. It is their intention to demand from the Middle East the supply to their pipe-lines of equal parts of British and United States oil-300,000 barrelseach. (Lord Halifax in Washington telegram No. 701 tells us that Ickes issuggesting that we give up our holding in Kuweit to the Americans.)4. Moreover, the Americans are insisting that the Conference should be confined to Middle Eastern supplies, though they have as well valuable fields inVenezuela, and in Colombia others as yet scarcely developed.5. If the Conference is held in the United States we shall be subjected tointense pressure from American public opinion. For the United States OilAdministrator has been disseminating a false impression of the oil situation,which has gained acceptance throughout America. - &apos;6&apos;. It is pretended that 95 per cent, of Allied war supplies are derived fromthe United States, by quoting 100 octane figures only. Many other misleadingfigures are given for the purpose of spreading opinion hostile to our oil interests.7. And again, the Administrator claims that the Americans have sunk an oil well for every 3 miles of their oil-bearing territory in the United States,while Britain has sunk in the Middle East only one well per 500 miles. Butthey do not point out that we have more oil wells per mile in our Middle Easternarea than they have in theirs.8. Under these circumstances it will be quite impossible to carry on discussions in Washington with any hope of justice. If we go there, we must make up our minds either to part with a valuable portion of our oil interests or to quarrel with the Administrator. And if we quarrel the American public will blame us.9. Lord Halifax should be told that a Conference in Washington will provefatal to our interests.10. After the last wTar the Americans took half of our portion of Iraq oil,using President Wilson&apos;s &quot; open door policy &quot; for the purpose. And in 1932when Andrew Mellon was Ambassador here, he pushed his own Company into. a 50 per cent, share of the oil from.Kivweit, which was to have been a Britishmonopoly. On both, these occasions the Foreign Office gave way in order to buyAmerican friendship.  It will be fatal if we do it again.11. There is no reason, even if we are committed to this Conference, for theForeign Office to get into the position of agreeing that it should be held inoil interests in the Middle East.[26937]
2Washington. There are, on the contrary, most powerful arguments in favourof meeting elsewhere. These reasons can be supplied immediately by me on demand.12. If the Conference is not held in Washington many expedients can be devised for procrastination.  And delay may confer immense benefits upon us.&apos;J (i) If we delay, we may get a change in the general foreign policy of thiscountry which will give us a better prospect of defending our assetswherever they may be, against the Americans. 1    - &apos;   :   &apos;(ii) The President may form a new Cabinet after the November elections,dropping Ickes. A new &quot;Oil Czar&quot; would not be more difficultto deal with, and might be more reasonable.(iii) The Republicans  are  opposing  the  Administration^  scheme  forconstructing a new pipe-line from Saudi Arabia to the eastern mediterranean. If this project is defeated, the oil discussions canbe postponed on that account. This will give us another chance. Andwe may be able to refuse a Conference the next time it is suggested.(iv) All the American oil interests, apart from the two Companies concernedin the pipe-line project, are united against the Administration.  Andthis internal American controversy may enable us to escape from,,, ,   ,.       the1 fray. ^    , .13. It should be our object, if possible, to postpone this Conferencealtogether. But if we are too far committed, then we should make it plain tothe Americans that the Conference must be held elsewhere. .14. If we are too far committed to a Washington Conference, then we mustJind means of breaking down on lack of information and inadequate details, &amp;c.15..   We dare not yield our assets.- Gwydyr House, Whitehall, S.W.1,15th February, 1944.
