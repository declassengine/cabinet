Printed for the War Cabinet, March, 1944SECRETW.P. (44) 1412nd March, 1944.WAR CABINETEXTENT OF MILITARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR RELIEF and rehabilitation IN europe memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARIntroductory.1. During the course of the first session of the Council of U.N.R.R.A, atAtlantic City, President Roosevelt issued a directive to Mr. Stimson, Secretary for War,dated 10th November, 1943, charging the U.S. War Department and the U.S. Armywith large responsibilities for the relief and rehabilitation of liberated areas in theevent both of military operations leading to liberation, and of a German collapse. this responsibility was laid on the U.S. military to obtain &quot; prompt results &quot; and until such time &quot; as civilian agencies must be prepared to carry out the longer range pro-,gramme of relief &quot;.  The text of the directive is set out in full at Appendix &quot;A&quot;.2. I was aware of the existence of the Presidential directive, but not of its terms,at the end of November last, at the time of the circulation of W.P. (43) 547 military requirements of Food for Civil Affairs [see the last sentence of paragraph 4 of that memorandum). In view of the pressure from the U.S. War Department at that time,and in order that a start should be made in procuring food supplies for Europe overand above the small stock of iron rations which the War Office had been able toarrange mainly from U.K. resources, I had authorized the British Army Staff in washington to agree with the Americans that procurement should take place for theestimated needs of France, Belgium and Holland for six months. This procurementwas to be for the whole of these countries, whether they were liberated in the courseof military operations, or as the result of a German collapse, and regardless of whether Allied armies would enter the whole or only part of the territories evacuatedby the enemy. As then advised, however. I was not prepared to accept a militaryresponsibility for handling and distributing supplies outside areas where there wereAllied military forces.I had also authorized procurement of sufficient food:  [a) to establish in Cairo a six weeks&apos; stockpile (as part of a six months&apos; programme)for three Balkan countries (Greece, Jugoslavia and Albania), and(&amp;) to meet the requirements of the Theatre Commander for Italy (see.P. (43) 547, paras. 8 (a) and (&amp;)).In addition, certain necessary supplies (other than food) have been authorized for thedifferent European theatres.3. The War Cabinet on 16th December, 1943 (171st (43) Meeting, Conclusion II(5) and (6)) approved my decision as regards procurement, and deferred a decision asregards military responsibility for distribution outside areas of military occupation.Certain preliminary discussions on the Presidents directive took place between the quartermaster-General and General Somervell at the Cairo conference, and the whole subject was gone into at some length during Sir Frederick Bovenschen&apos;s visit to washington in January, when it was possible to obtain from the U.S. War department and fairly clear definition of how they proposed to interpret the directive. During thelatter conversations it was made clear that the Americans attached great importance to aceptance by the British Army of similar relief obligations to those of the american army. It is now, therefore, necessary to reach a decision on the question deferred at the171st (43) Meeting of the Cabinet, and on the extent of the. responsibility of the british army for relief and rehabilitation.Copy No.   35
Earlier British and American Military Relief Policy.4. Up to the time of the issue of the Presidents directive, the principles followedby the War Office as regards provision of supplies for liberated and conquered areashad been as follows:  (i) for planning purposes military responsibility should be for a yardstick periodof &quot;six months after the opening of operations in any country;(ii) the military would hand over responsibility for supply (as well as civil admmis-tration) to civil authorities, whether indigenous or U.N.R.R.A., as soonas operations permitted;(iii) civilian supplies should be the minimum necessary to prevent disease andunrest from prejudicing operations. There was no rigid catalogue of such supplies; we were prepared to consider each proposal on its merits. Asregards food, we aimed at the provision of sufficient to reach a standardof 2,000 calories a head a day, where local resources do not reach thatstandard;(iv) we were not prepared to accept any military responsibility for supplies (or civil administration) in hiatus areas, i.e., areas evacuated by the enemy,but which there was no operational justification for our troops to enter.5. The U.S. War Department agreed with the War Office on (i) and (ii) above,and on the general principle in (iii). They were, however, inclined to adopt a more limited and austere definition of what this principle meant when translated into com-modities, and limited themselves to food, medical and sanitary supplies, soap, coal and petroleum. They accepted the 2,000 calories standard for food. They were preparedthat &quot;civilian agencies&quot; whether U.N.R.R.A., the Office of Foreign EconomicAdministration (F.E.A.) or others should provide additional items, which the militarywould ship and distribute if resources of shipping and transportation and the operationalsituation permitted.   Their attitude on hiatus areas was uncertain.Present American Proposals under President&apos;s Directive.6. The present position of the U.S. War Department, and their definition of the presidents directive, are as follows:  (i) the military should prepare relief requirements for six months for all countriesin Europe, other than Russia and the neutrals, but including enemy countries,regardless of whether the whole of such countries are likely to be enteredby Allied armies;(ii) requirements should be prepared on alternative hypotheses of:  (a) German collapse without a scorched earth policy;(6) German collapse with a scorched earth policy;(c) successful but contested invasion with a scorched earth policy;(iii) requirements should include foodstuffs (2,000 calorie basis), clothing and footwear(five coupons a head for six months), and the following on a minimum basis : medical and sanitary supplies, soap, coal, petroleum, items needed for first aidrehabilitation of agriculture, items needed for first aid rehabilitation of industries(and there may be other items on which the Americans have not yet formulatedtheir views, such as transportation equipment);(iv) procurement for supplies to be provided by the United States should then be initiated by the U.S. War Department for all save the last two classes of requirements, which should be obtained on the U.S. side by F.E.A., or other appropriate American civilian agencies: they were undecided on which ofthe hypotheses in (ii) to base their requests for procurement to the supply authorities. This would be a matter for discussion and agreement. one possible basis for procurement would be the major figure for each com-commodity in whatever set of estimates it appeared;(v) such procurement should not take place for countries likely to be entered bythe Russian armies. The needs of these should be discussed with theRussians at an early date, but the estimates prepared help to give the combined Boards a complete picture of European needs and would be a useful check against Russian figures. (The War Department have not thought out how or where these discussions with the Russians should takeplace. The question of relief for territories in Eastern Europe likely to be entered by the Russian armies is under examination by the Foreign office with the other Departments concerned in accordance with Conclusion (8)of the 175th (43) meeting of the War Cabinet, held on 23rd December, 1943) ;(vi) in areas entered or occupied by Allied armies the distribution of supplies, sofar as operational exigencies permitted, would be undertaken initially by themilitary as a normal function of the military control of civil administration;
(vii) hiatus areas would fall into two categories:  (a) those where there is an indigenous government capable of administration and of the distribution of relief,(b) those where there is chaos or possibly revolution and no local govern-ment capable of relief distribution.In (a) the American policy is to ship supplies to the appropriate ports,but to leave subsequent distribution entirely to the indigenous authorities.They intend, however, to appoint a mission to the appropriate governments with inspectors or supervisors to ensure that U.S. assets are not exploitedand that the impact of relief on the U.S. economy is kept to the minimum.In (6) there would be no shipment of supplies by the military, thoughthe latter might be prepared to sell the supplies they had procured to anycivilian agency undertaking relief in such countries. If for political reasonsmilitary occupation of such countries took place, then the military would accept responsibility for relief as in (vi);(viii) early discussions with the various Allied Governments would be necessary sothat the latter might plan for the considerable problem of relief adminis-tration which would fall upon them.7. The U.S. War Department strongly urged that the War Office should associateitself with the above policy. In such case requirements should be agreed as quickly as possible and procurement initiated On a combined basis after consultation with theappropriate American and British supply authorities. &quot;Once procured the supplies would be available against the requisitions of the Supreme Allied Commander in thecase of a combined theatre, and of the American or British Commander in the case of american or British theatres.8. The U.S. War Department argued that the policy contained in the Presidentsdirective as interpreted above was the only really practicable one to follow, since themilitary authorities alone could say when and where hiatus areas were likely to be created and for security reasons this information could not be passed on to civilianauthorities, who could not therefore plan in advance for such areas. They also argued,and in this I think there is much force, that for the initial period of liberation, andparticularly for the event of a German collapse, the military authorities alone are in aposition to plan, procure and ship supplies on the scale likely to be required.9. The U.S. State Department supported the request of the U.S. War department that the War Office should adopt a similar relief responsibility, and went so far as tosay that it would be disastrous if they did not.10. It was made clear by Sir Frederick Bovenschen that the questions raised wouldrequire a Cabinet decision. In order, however, that there should be no loss of timewhilst the matter was under consideration in London, the British Army Staff wereauthorized to make a detailed study of the American requirement figures in conjunctionwith the War Department and to reach agreement on the figures as figures. In additionwe have recently, as the result of discussion with the Ministry of Food, been able toinform the British Army Staff, Washington, of the conditions as to replacement, review,etc., under which certain quantities of foodstuffs might be made available, if necessary,from stocks in this country in the immediate future. The Americans attached greatimportance to this point, and now that they have been notified of what can bedone and the figures of overall requirements have been agreed, the way is clear forspeedy action on a combined basis in preparation for European relief needs, providedthat it is decided that the War Office and the British Army should adopt the same policy as that of the U.S. War Department and U.S. Army.Discussion of the American Proposals.11. In W.P. (43) 547, I expressed my reluctance to accept any military responsibilityfor the distribution of relief outside areas in military occupation, since I thought thiswould impose a burden on our manpower and military resources which might beoverwhelming, and would adversely affect our military objectives. The U.S. war department have, however, interpreted the Presidents directive in a way which limitsmilitary responsibility to (a) procurement and (6) shipment to ports, except for areasof military occupation, for which in any case a military responsibility is inevitable,and had always been recognized. Whether the President intended so narrow a definition of his directive is another matter. When asked directly whether they planned to useU.S. Army transportation units outside areas of military occupation the War Departmentanswered emphatically in the negative. This being so, my main objections to our association with the policy in the directive are removed, though the position of Greecein relation to this policy may require special consideration.(16922)
12. On the other hand there are clearly good reasons why we should agree with the WarDepartments proposals as set out in paragraphs 6 and 7 above. It would clearly be most unsatisfactory, and in fact unworkable, for the British Army to follow one policy and theAmerican another in the course of operations under a Supreme Commander. Further, weshall be considerably dependent on American supplies for relief during the military periodeven if we limit our military responsibility to the principles we have hitherto followed. Wehave had little success up to date in obtaining such supplies : we are likely to have lessif our policy differs fundamentally from the American. Finally, in present circumstances, ifrelief supplies are to be forthcoming during the initial period after liberation it is unlikelythat any civilian or international authority will be able to provide them.13. The War Department were asked whether they thought that the necessary supplies could be made available should the War Office join in the policy proposed. Their answer was that no such assurance could be given, and that meeting the minimum standards in thecase of food would probably require the lowering of existing standards in the United States.14. The study made by the British Army Staff in Washington of the American figures(see paragraph 10) has resulted in substantial agreement being reached so far as figuresgo on the general basis of the prevention of disease and unrest, and a summary of thesefigures is given in Appendix &quot; B &quot; (for food) and Appendix &quot;C&quot; (for other agreedcommodities). It will be noted that except for medical supplies and seeds-no provision made for Germany and Austria, other than for displaced persons in those countries.The figures cover the alternative set out in paragraph 6 (ii) (a), namely, German collapsewithout a scorched earth policy. In view of the urgency of the situation, these figures,when approved by the Combined Civil Affairs Committee in Washington, will be referred tothe appropriate supply authorities of the two countries. When the views of the combined boards as to availability and source of supply have been received by the Combined civil affairs Committee, modification or the substitution of alternative commodities will be madewhere necessary in respect of commodities in short supply. It is proposed that procurementshould then be initiated, except for areas which may be entered by the Russian armies.:Proposals regarding the financial arrangements for provision of supplies are at present under discussion in Washington. Financial discussions with the recipient Allies will also benecessary.When figures have been agreed on the basis of the two other Irypotheses mentioned inparagraph 6 (ii) (b) and (c), further reference to the appropriate supply authorities will haveto be made in cases where these figures show a need for an increased quantity of any com-commodity or for the inclusion of a new commodity.The machinery described above has been devised so as to enable the combined supply authorities to indicate availability for particular areas in the light of total availability ascompared with the total requirements of Europe. British representation on the combined boards and on the Combined Civil Affairs Committee will ensure that the needs of theBritish civilian population, as well as those of the Army, are fully safeguarded. It should beemphasized that the agreed figures are based on the approved scales without final commit-ment as to availability on which the views of the respective supply authorities are awaited.Conclusion.15. In the light of the above explanation of the U.S. War Department proposals in interpretation of the Presidents directive, and of the clear advantages of the U.S.and British armies following similar policies as regards military responsibility for relief, Ifavour acceptance of the American proposals, and in this I have the concurrence of mycolleagues on the Ministerial Committee on Armistice Terms and Civil Administration.16. I therefore ask the War Cabinet :-to authorize me to accept on behalf of the War Office and Army a responsibility for relief and rehabilitation in liberated and conquered areas in Europe on theprinciples set out in paragraph 6 above (with the necessary changes consequent upon the differences between British and U.S. governmental machinery), and totake action in conjunction with the U.S. War Department, as in paragraph above, as regards agreement on requirements, procurement and allocation of relief supplies.P. J. G.The War Office,2nd March, 1944.
CopyAPPENDIX &quot;A&quot;SECURITYSECRETThe White House,Washington.November 10, 1943.Dear Mr. Secretary :Although other agencies of the Government are preparing themselves for the work that must be done in connection with the relief and rehabilitation of liberated areas, it is quite apparentif prompt results are to be obtained the Army will have to assume the initial burden of shipping and distributing relief supplies. This will not only be the case in the event that active militaryoperations are under way, but also in the event of a German collapse. I envisage that in the eventof a German collapse, the need for the Army to undertake this work will be all the more apparent.Therefore, I direct that you have the Army undertake the planning necessary to enable it tocarry out this task to the end that it shall be prepared to perform this function, pending such time as civilian agencies must be prepared to carry out the longer range programme of relief.You may take this letter as my authority to you to call upon all other agencies of theGovernment for such plans and assistance as you may need. For all matters of policy that haveto be determined in connection with this work, you will consult with the State Department forany political advice; and upon the Treasury for such economic and fiscal direction as you may need.Very sincerely yours,The Honorable , /s/      Franklin D.
