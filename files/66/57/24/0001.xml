THIS DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC JMAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. GoPy No-W.P. (44) 624.6th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.REINSTATEMENT IN THE CIVIL SERVICE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.FOLLOWING the Reinstatement in Civil Employment Act, 1944, it isnecessary to make an announcement about the position of Civil Servants who left the Service to join the Forces without the permission of their Departments. It isalso necessary to consider the position of Civil Servants who were called up butregistered as conscientious objectors. The Act, which came into operation onthe 1st August this year, does not apply to the Crown, but an undertaking hasbeen given that its provisions would be applied so far as possible as though theCrown were a private employer. Instructions on the application now have to beissued.I. Men and Wom,en who resigned to join the Forces, &amp;c.2. As regards Civil Servants who left the Service to join the Forces withoutthe permission of their Departments, it has always been clear that they would bereinstated when released from the Forces. On the other hand, no pledge has beengiven. Departments have up to date opposed the giving of any pledge, as they felt that to do so would strain still further the loyalty of the young men above the ages of reservation who have obeyed orders and stayed at their, desks even though they would much have preferred to join up. I think, however, that the pledgeshould now be given, and the necessity for making a statement about the applica-tion of the Reinstatement Act to Crown Servants offers a convenient opportunity.3. I propose that these men and women should be put into precisely thesame position when they are released from the Forces as those who were underthe ages of reservation and who, therefore, may be regarded as having enlistedwith the permission of their Departments. This will mean that their service with the Forces will count for pension under the Superannuation Acts and also for incremental progression up the salary scales. The only loss they incur willbe that, unlike those who enlisted with permission, they will not have receivedbalance of civil pay, if any, during their service with the Forces. It is probablethat legislation will be necessary before their service can count for pension, and,if so, I should propose to introduce it in due course.4. I have referred only to men and women who joined the Forces. Thereare some cases of officers who joined other forms of national service without permission, e.g., women who have become nurses. I think that these&quot; cases should be considered on their merits, in consultation between the employingDepartment and the Treasury, if and when the officers in question seekreinstatement.II. Conscientious Objectors.5. As regards conscientious objectors, there are several different types.First, there are those whose objection was only to combatant service and whohave served in non-combatant units -the R.A.M.C., &amp;c. Historically these men have always been treated exactly like the fighting men and no question, therefore,arises on them.[28543]
6. Secondly, there are the conscientious objectors who were directed into some form of national service -civil defence, agriculture, industry, &amp;c. and whoobeyed the direction. These men have received no balance of civil pay during their War service. They have not been dismissed from the Civil Service but are regarded as being in a state of suspense. Under the Reinstatement Act,employers are obliged to reinstate for a period men who have served in a civil defence force in consequence of an enrolment notice issued under the NationalService Acts, if it is reasonable and practicable to do so, and no exception ismade of conscientious objectors. Employers are not obliged to reinstate menwho have gone, whether by direction or not, into other forms of national service,such as agriculture. As the result of consultation between the Treasury and thelargest employing Departments, I propose that a promise should now be givento all of these officers that when they are released from national service they willbe reinstated. I do not think that their period of national service should countfor pension under the Superannuation Acts, but I do think that it should countfor incremental progression up the salary scales.7. Finally, there are conscientious objectors who refused to obey the directiongiven to them by the tribunal and were sent to prison. These men were dismissedfrom the Service because of their refusal to obey directions. I propose that their cases should be considered individually, by the employing Department and theTreasury in consultation, when application for reinstatement is made. In somecases the original decision of the tribunal was overruled on appeal and a directionwas given to the conscientious objector which he felt able to obey. I think thatin these cases the men should be treated in the same way as those who obeyed thefirst direction. In other cases refusal was maintained for a period, or may havebeen maintained throughout, and it will be for consideration in the circumstancesof each case whether the officer should be reinstated or not. I do not think it practicable to lay down in advance any general rule for dealing with these cases.8. I should add that, at the request of the three Service Departments, theTreasury &quot;has undertaken to arrange that they should not be asked to re-employtheir own conscientious objectors, but that these men, if due to be reinstated underthe above proposals, should be transferred to some other Department.9. I should be glad of the authority of the War Cabinet for the issue of instructions to Departments on the above lines.J. A.Treasury Chambers, Whitehall, S.W. 1,6th November, 1944.
