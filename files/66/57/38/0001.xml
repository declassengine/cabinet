THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 638.10th November, 1944REPAIR OF WAR DAMAGE AND WINTER accommodation in LONDON.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.MY colleagues may like to have the following summary of the progress made with the emergency repair of war-damaged houses in London.2. The labour force engaged by London local authorities on the repair ofwar damage to houses has been raised from 60,000 men in the middle ofSeptember to 112,500; and the Minister of Labour will endeavour to reach and keep to a stable figure of 117,500.3. Eighty-six local authorities in the London region, covering about 85 percent, of the work to be done, have sent in returns showing that in the six weeks sincethe middle of September they have repaired 20 per cent., of the houses includedin their programme for the winter. Last week these eighty-six authoritiesrepaired a total of 30,000 houses.The standard of repair is &apos;&apos; reasonable comfort,&apos;&apos; not complete reinstate-ment; and, as the object is to increase as rapidly as possible the number ofhabitable homes, there has naturally been a tendency to concentrate first on theless seriously damaged houses.4. There remain twenty-one weeks until the 31st March, 1945, by which time we hope that the repair work within the present programme will have been substantially completed. As the labour force has been growing and shouldshortly attain its maximum strength, and greater efficiency, the progress made sofar and the prospects for the future are reasonably satisfactory.5. The large influx of labour strained the task of supervision and manage-ment at the beginning : this aspect is well in hand although, inevitably, scratchlabour needs some time to get into a well organised routine.6. There were local shortages of some supplies at the beginning of theperiod : the Minister of Works now has this problem well in control.W.4, Richmond Terrace.10th November, 1944.Copy NOoWAR CABINET.tII[28578]
