BRIDGES.Of/ices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,8th November, 1944.ANNEX.Extract from a Letter from General Carton de Wiart to General Ismay,dated 18th September, 1944.* * *  - * * *YOU will have had my Amuse 23 and 24, as a result of my visit to Kweilin.To say I was shocked at what I found there is putting things very mildly.2.....Before I go on, I must tell you how very well Colonel Ride, ofthe British Army Aide Group, has done : he is really splendid and deserves verygreat credit, and so do some of those working with him. I told him that, as faras I was concerned, he was now simply a British Officer and must keep the flagflying till the last moment. There was no need for me to tell him this, he wouldhave done it anyhow, but I wanted him to know my views, and he has had a veryraw deal from the British Military Mission here.3. I went to the front, 78 miles in a truck, as Ride has nothing else, whichis scandalous, and when I got there I was appalled at the ignorance of military matters displayed by the Chinese; I thought our Allies had given them some military instruction on the subject, but I was wrong.4. There were two Chinese Divisions holding a gorge, which couldcomfortably have been held by a battalion, no protection on the flanks and in the rear; although there must be fifty good rear-guard positions between the front and Kweilin, there was not one soldier.5. The Chinese General was quite happy and said there was no Japaneseforce of any size within 20 miles. He pressed me to stay to lunch, but as thatis a lengthy business and I was very pressed for time, I declined. Within an hour of my leaving the Japanese attacked !&apos; Those two divisions are now making their way back to Kweilin, but I can get little information as to how they are getting on.   However, I told you enough for you to judge the form.6.   The Chinese can really only do two things -run like Hell if stronglyattacked, or get into the nearest,town and then fight well to defend it.  They have little idea of attacking; if their attack fails they merely dribble up more men,who at once get wiped out.  They have no idea of staging an attack.[28562]
7.   I was, however, very much impressed by the soldier, who looked well, was -cheerful and up to lots of work; officers very poor, in most cases, but I didn&apos;t have time, to really judge.8. When I got back to Kweilin, I went and saw Brigadier-General Vincent,CO. of the Air Force, a very fine man, and asked him if he wished for any information and he wanted all I could give him. When I had finished, he thankedme and said it was the first time he had ever had a picture of the situation ! i cannot understand it: the Americans have quite a number of officers, masses ofjeeps, but never seem to go up and see what is happening, but they work likeblacks in their offices-and were most helpful and are ditto to Ride.9. The Chinese at Kweilin were very nice. The Governor, G.O.C., &amp;c,came to meet me and see me off and were all over one, never having seen a senior officer of any sort before. I told the American CO. all this, as I know himwell, and he- took it very well and must have wired to Stilwell, as he turnedup the next day. I met him on his way, and he was very friendly, although Irepeated the whole story to him. I think he fully realises I do not wish to meddle,but only help.10. The Americans have four beautiful airfields there, fully equipped. Theywere preparing to evacuate and demolish, but will certainly not go before they need, for they are absolute tigers, I have never seen better.11.. The other Americans I believe have now left. Chennault very kindlyarranged for his Chief of Staff to pick me up, as I have no plane, and he took me toLuichow and Nanning. The former has a huge airfield, fully equipped, but I fearit will go, if the Japanese keep up their advance : Nanning is only a field forfighters and of no use for big stuff.12. Kweilin may hold out for weeks, so may Liuchow, but once the japanese are near/the airfields must be given up and we have nothing left. The Japanesecan then occupy South-East China in peace. Should a force of ours wish toland on that coast, they can have no land-based air support.13. The whole thing is appalling, it has been obvious for months that this might happen, and nothing has been done. I know you could do nothing about it, you told me so when I wrote to you in April. Had the Americans acted thenall this would never have happened.14. I saw the Generalissimo on my return, and wired you his attitude.He does not really realise what the loss of these airfields mean. But nor doeshe know anything of our plans, as you. will have gathered from my wires. he must know if we want him to co-operate. I am certain one can tell him and itwill go no further. I have tested him on small matters, and even his Staff knewnothing about the matters a fortnight after.15. But to tell him the ridiculous stories S.E.A.C. suggest : No, I oan&apos;tand won&apos;t. I am quite prepared to say I know nothing, and it is generally true. Iam of no value here unless I have the Generalissimo&apos;s confidence and I think I can say I have it pretty fully, but if I tell him childish stories, I shall lose it.16.   He should be told on broad lines what we propose to do he will not ask for secret details.17. He is very anxious we should take Rangoon and Moulmein, and refers to it every time I see him; I can tell him nothing, because I don&apos;t know. when told Mountbatten, before he went to England, that this was the Generalissimo&apos;swish, he was delighted, as he thought it might turn the balance in favour ofRangoon, when the Americans were so keen on a push from the North. since then I have heard nothing.18. I wired you his hopes about British troops being in the Allied Forceout here and there is no need for me to add more. I think his fear is, to be leftentirely in the hands of the Americans.19. I have seen Hurley and Nelson, they tell me they had been told tocontact me, I don&apos;t quite know why, except that Hurley spoke pretty freely aboutthe Command out here, but you know as much and a good deal more about thatthan I do.***** * .
