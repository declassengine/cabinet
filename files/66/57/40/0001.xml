THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOYEUMMSNTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.MS.P. (44) 640.10th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.LEGISLATION ON BALANCED DISTRIBUTION OE INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the President of the Board oe Trade.1. Legislation will be required next Session to give effect to a number of proposals contained in Chapter III (paragraph 20-30) of the White Paper on employment Policy. Following discussion between the Departments concerned,and in the Distribution of Industry Committee, I am now making recommenda-tions to the War Cabinet for the framing of this legislation. Powers conferred upon the Board of Trade by this legislation should, of course, be exercised inconsultation with the other appropriate Departments.2. The Bill must include provision for certain areas, in particular need of additional and more diversified employment, to be declared &quot; development areas&quot; from time to time. It will be the aim of the Government to anticipate the occurrence of depression rather than, as in the past, to attempt to remedyit after it has occurred, and it will, therefore, be essential to link up the adminis-tration of this policy with the man-power budget of the Ministry of Labour.Strategical conditions and the requirements of national defence should also betaken into account.3. Development Areas should be defined in a Schedule to the Bill, and pro-vision should be made for a review of the Schedule after a period of, say, threeyears. The Bill should provide that, following this review, any changes, whetherby addition or subtraction, in the Development Areas, should be made by Order,subject to affirmative Parliamentary Resolution.4. Power must be taken in the Bill to enable the Board of Trade, where this is necessary in order to create a better balanced distribution&apos;of industry, tobuild factories on individual or collective sites for sale or lease, to establish and finance trading estates, to acquire land compulsorily or by agreement, and to clear sites, for industrial development. These powers will &quot;be mainly exercisedwithin the Development Areas, but they should also be exercisable outside theAreas in appropriate cases.5. As regards financial facilities, generally speaking it is expected thatapproved undertakings will find their requirements of capital from non-Govern-ment sources. This process will be facilitated by the control over capital issues,which will favour applicants from Development Areas, coupled with the proposalsnow under consideration for the formation of new institutions to fill gaps in thecommercial financing system. In addition, however, some provision must be madefor Government finance to ensure&apos; that a firm, approved by the Board of trade on distribution of industry grounds and otherwise showing good prospects ofsuccess on a commercial basis, is able to proceed with its enterprise even though some special risk, arising out of the location of the undertaking in accordancewith the approved policy, prevents it from getting all the finance it requiresfrom commercial sources. A scheme of Government finance for this purpose,providing for grants in aid of interest on capital and, in exceptional cases, foradvances of secured and equity capital from Departmental Votes, is under discus-sion between the Board of Trade and the Treasury. These financial facilitieswill only be made available within Development Areas.[28579]
6. &quot; The Government,&quot; in the words of the White Paper, &quot;will take suchaction as may be necessary to secure the full development in these Areas of the basic services on which industry depends, and to stimulate the modernisation of their capital equipment, e.g., the improvement of communications (includingdocks and harbours, as well as roads and railways), the extension of powerservices, and the improvement of housing, other amenities and general public services.&quot; In the case of services for which no other Department is responsible,it is proposed that the Board of Trade should take power to make grants forthe above purpose. In the case of services for which another Department is responsible, it is proposed that the necessary grants should be provided by that department, which would, of course, work in close consultation with the Boardof Trade. In so far as Departments which normally supervise any of the above-mentioned services do not now possess the power to make grants in aid of these services for the purpose defined above in the White Paper, such power shouldbe conferred by the Bill.7. The Bill must also provide, in the words of the White Paper, for &quot; powerto be taken to prohibit the establishment of a new factory in a district whereserious disadvantage would arise from further industrial development.&quot; Heretoo strategical considerations and the requirements of national defence shouldbe taken into account.8. In the words of the White Paper, &quot; industrialists contemplating theestablishment of new factories, or the transfer of a factory from one area toanother, will be required to notify the Government before their plans reach an advanced stage. This will enable the Government to exercise substantialinfluence over the location of new industrial development, as contemplated bythe Barlow Report.&quot; The Bill must, therefore, empower the Board of Tradeto require firms to notify to it any proposal to build or extend a factory above a certain size.   This provision should be as simple as possible.I recommend a provision whereby no new building or extension can be begun,unless the&apos; Board of Trade have been notified, say, three months beforehand, or unless permission for the building has already been obtained from the Board.9. It must be decided whether firms are also to be required to notify their intention of starting a new business in an existing building. This is necessary if we are to carry out the provision of the White Paper that the &quot; transfer ofa factory&quot; (meaning, presumably, the transfer of a business) must be notified.On this point there is a difference of opinion among the Departments concerned.I recommend that the Bill, as introduced into Parliament, should contain sucha provision, in order to test Parliamentary opinion.10. As indicated in the White Paper, the Special Areas Acts should bebrought to an end by the Bill, and provision made for an appropriate transferof the commitments entered into by the Commissioners.11. I propose that the Bill should.apply to England, Wales and Scotland,but not to Northern Ireland. In Scotland, all the powers conferred by the Billshould be exercised in close association with the Secretary of State for Scotland.It is intended that a corresponding Bill covering Northern Ireland shall beintroduced in the Northern Ireland Parliament.12. I ask my colleagues to accept my recommendations, and to authorisethe drafting of a Bill for the Legislation Committee as soon as possible.Board of Trade, Millbank, S.W. 1,10th November, 1944.H. D.
