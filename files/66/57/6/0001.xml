THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET.opy. No.W.P. (44) 606.30th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.SPECIAL BROADCASTS AND LEAFLETS FOR THECHANNEL ISLANDS.Memorandum by the Minister of Information.AT a meeting of the War Cabinet on the 23rd October, 1944 (W.M. (44) 140thConclusions, Minute 12), the Political Warfare Executive was instructed to convey-to the Commander and principal officers of the German garrison of the channel islands, by means of broadcasts and leaflets, a message to the effect that they willbe held responsible for the well-being of the civilian population.2. This instruction follows the rejection by His Majesty&apos;s Government ofGerman proposals received through the Swiss Government to the effect that, inview of the exhaustion of food supplies for the civilian population of the Islands,arrangements should be made either (a) to evacuate the population, or(b) to allow the importation of food by means of Red Cross ships;the grounds for such rejection being that the feeding of the civilian population is the German Commander&apos;s responsibility, and that if he is unable to feed themhis proper course is to surrender.3. Apart from purely legal considerations, the case for such action does notappear to be a strong one. From the practical point of view, what is proposed issimply to tell the German Commander to do something which he is unable to do,namely, to feed the civilian population when he has no food for them on the islands and is unable to import any in other words to use the sufferings of the civilian population as a lever to compel surrender. Moreover, the GermanCommander would be in a position to make a telling reply by publicising the,proposals as regards evacuation and Red Cross food ships made by his Govern-ment and rejected by His Majesty&apos;s Government. He could also cite recentprecedents from Calais and Dunkirk for the evacuation of civilians under aflag of truce.4. The Political Warfare Executive has also received a request from theHome Office for a message to be conveyed by broadcast and/or leaflet to the civilians on the Islands in terms designed to maintain their morale. The onlykind of message to them,which could achieve this object would be either (a) a message holding out a prospect of liberation at an early date, or(b). a message holding out a prospect of food supplies at an early date,neither of which would be appropriate in the circumstances. -5.   I therefore invite my colleagues to reconsider this decision.B. B.Ministry of Information,30th October, 1944.[28495]
