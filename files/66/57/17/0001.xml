SECRET.Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.Copy No. 3W.F. (44) 617.with November, 1944.WAR CABINET.LOCAL ELECTIONS.report by the h-ome secretary, the lord privy seal, the secretary ofState for Scotland and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.1. At their meeting oil the 1st November (W.M. (44) 144th Conclusions,Minute 2) the ,War Cabinet invited us to discuss the proposals in the joint memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland -(W.P. (44) 588) on local elections. We held a meeting on the 2nd November atwhich We reached the conclusions set forth in the following paragraphs. TheSecretary of State for Scotland was unable to be present at the meeting, but was represented by the Lord Advocate.2. Assimilation of the Local Government Franchise with the ParliamentaryWe agree that the unanimous recommendation of the Speaker&apos;s Conference,that the local government franchise should be based on the same qualifications asthe Parliamentary franchise, should be accepted, on the understanding that,as proposed by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland,absentee owners in Scotland and occupiers of property in more than one electoralarea both in England and Wales and in Scotland should, subject to claim, retain the Ideal government franchise in those areas where they pay rates.3. Local Government Franchise for Service Voters.We recognise that there will be considerable difficulties in arranging for theexercise of the local government franchise by Service voters. In particular, whereService voters are serving abroad they will be unlikely to know what issue maybe dominating the local election, under they may have difficulty in identifying thecandid their party labels. Nevertheless, we think that arrangements shouldbe made to enable Service voters to vote at local elections by proxy in the same wayas1 at Parliamentary elections.4. Date at which Local Elections should be restarted.We approve the proposals made by the Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Scotland with regard to the dates at which elections should berestarted. In England the first borough elections will be held in the Autumn of1945 and the first county council and district council elections in the spring of 1946. In Scotland the burgh, county and district council elections will be.restarted in the Autumn of 1945.5. Retirement of Councillors,In the case of county councils and some district councils all councillors retiresimultaneously at the end of three years&apos; service and new councillors are elected.In the case, however, of municipal councils and some district councils in Englandand Wales and of town councils in Scotland the normal practice is for one-thirdof the councillors to retire annually. The suspension of elections during the war has meant that these councils now consist of members elected in 1936, 1937 or 1938and, in some councils, in 1939, together with a number, in some cases considerable,of members Co-opted in the place of elected councillors who have died or resigned.The memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland (W.P. (44) 588) proposes that the Bill should provide for the retirement of all councillors at the first local election to be held, and should, where necessary,contain transitional provisions to enable retirement by annual thirds to berestarted at the next ensuing local elections.In favour of this it can be argued that councillors who have been elected for three years ought not, if an election is possible^ to be continued in office fora period which would amount to nine years; and that co-opted members, whoFranchise.[28531]
have never been before the electorate at all, should go out of office as soon aspossible.On  he other hand, it is urged that continuity in local government is of greatimportance and that it is undesirable to make a clean sweep of the existingcouncillors at a time when the local government electorate is being changedthrough the assimilation proposals.The Association of Municipal Corporations and the Urban District CouncilAssociation in England are against a clean sweep and, although the convention of Royal Burghs and the Association of Counties of Cities in Scotland are on thewhole in favour, a substantial number of their members are against it.We are not in agreement on this matter. The Lord Privy Seal and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster are of opinion that the principle of retire-ment by annual thirds should be adhered to and that no distinction should be made between co-opted and elected members.The Home Secretary, although he holds that there is a strong case for theclean sweep, would be prepared to accept a scheme under which retirement shouldtake place by annual thirds, where that has hitherto been the practice, subjectto the proviso that in any ward where there was a co-opted member he shouldretire first. Where in any ward there was more than one co-opted member, the member with the longest service would retire first.The Lord Advocate reserved the position of the Secretary of State forScotland, who desires to press for the clean sweep.6. Aldermen.In the case of aldermen we are agreed that no change should be made in theprocedure under which half the number retire each three years.7. Preparation of the Register.Under the Parliamentary Electors (Wartime Registration) Acts, 1943 and1944, the electoral registration officer must prepare a new register for eachParliamentary election. This register ,is prepared from material supplied by national registration officers. It must be published on the 36th day from the initiation of the election, and the total interval between the initiation of theelection and the poll is 1\ weeks.If there were a general election and new registers had to be prepared inevery constituency, it would, in the view of the Stationery Office, be impossible,by the use of normal printing facilities, to print and publish the register in theprescribed period of 36 days.In view of the likelihood of a general election next year, we propose that theBill should provide that registration officers in all areas should be required toprepare registers to come into operation on the 15th May and the 15th October,1945. The qualifying dates for these registers would be 31st January and30th June respectively.Owing to the longer interval between the qualifying dates and the publicationof the registers, they would be less up-to-date than those prepared under theParliamentary Electors (Wartime Registration) Acts, 1943 and 1944, for particular elections. Since, however, there would be a longer interval in which to deal with claims and objections, they should be more accurate. A recentsample check has suggested that there is a considerable margin of error in thematerial from which the register will be compiled under the 1943 and 1944 Acts.Nevertheless, in the unlikely event of a general election before the 15th May,1945, an imperfect register would have to be produced to the timetable of the1943 and 1944 Acts and could be used.The Lord Privy Seal is of opinion that we should go still further than theproposal to prepare registers to come into operation on the 15th May and the15th October, and that a register ought to be available for a general electionheld before the 15th May. He has suggested that the enquiries which are beingmade into the possibility of using the newspaper presses, if necessary, for thispurpose should be pursued.The Lord Privy Seal also suggests that an attempt should be made to improve the accuracy of the material from which the registers under the 1943 and 1944Acts are compiled.H.
