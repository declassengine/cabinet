In preparing the draft of the Opening Speech the Committee had beforethem a list of the Bills suggested by Departments for inclusion in the legislative programme for the 1944-45 Session, and they proceeded on the principle ofreferring only to important Bills which seemed to have a reasonably good chanceof being passed in the coming Session. Since the Committee approved thedraft, the President of the Board of Trade has urged strongly that it should contain references to legislation on (i) the balanced distribution of industry, and(ii) the investigation and control of restrictive practices. The President of theBoard of Trade points out that legislation on both these subjects is essentialto the fulfilment of the policy laid down in the White Paper on employment policy; and that the work of settling,the principles of the necessary legislation has reached an advanced stage. He accordingly suggests that the following sentence should be inserted in the last paragraph but three of the opening speech :  &apos;&apos; You will be invited to pass legislation to secure a balanceddistribution of industry, and to investigate and control restrictive practices in industry.&quot;C.

1    to&apos;Draft King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of ParliamentTuesday, 28th November, 1944.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :THE past year has seen the intensification of the efforts of My peoples andof those of My Allies to free the world from German and Japanese oppression,and we are now reaping the reward of the long years of endurance and preparationthat have gone before.2. The victories achieved are the fruits of the close friendship which knitstogether My Governments and those of My Allies a. friendship fostered by the meetings between Allied leaders which have played such a notable part in the furtherance of our common purpose.3. Within the Commonwealth and Empire the ties that unite My peopleswere further strengthened by the meetings in London at which My PrimeMinisters from My Dominions and the Prime Minister of Southern rhodesia and representatives of My Empire of India conferred with My Prime Ministerof the United Kingdom. The declaration which they issued at the conclusion oftheir meetings expressed the common resolve of My peoples to devote their wholeenergies towards victory in the struggle in which we are engaged.4. In the wider sphere, the meeting at Teheran, where for the first timethe leaders of the United States and of the Soviet Union met in joint conference with My Prime Minister, settled the co-ordinated strategy which has unfoldeditself in the past year. In Cairo My Prime Minister and the President of theUnited States were able to confer with the leader of the Chinese people. Andthis autumn My Prime Minister has undertaken further arduous journeys, toQuebec to concert with the President of the United States plans for the conductof the war in the Far East, and to Moscow to co-ordinate with Marshal Stalinthe plans for achieving the final downfall of Hitlerite Germany and to reviewwith him the problems of Europe. More recently he has paid, at the invitation of the President of the French Provisional Government, a visit to Paris, whichhas demonstrated afresh the cordial friendship which unites the French andBritish peoples. In all these visits My Prime Minister was assisted by thepresence of My Foreign Secretary.5. In the theatres of war throughout the world, the Forces of all My peopleshave continued to fight in close comradeship with the gallant Forces of theUnited States and My other Allies.6. My Forces from the United Kingdom and from Canada, with theircomrades from the United States, successfully launched the long-prepared assault on the shores of Western Europe, established a foothold in the face of determined opposition, and, after destroying the German armies which opposed them, have advanced through France and Belgium to the gates of Germany.7. Never before in the history of the United Kingdom has a militaryenterprise so completely absorbed the energies of the whole nation. The successesof My Forces have been rendered possible only by the devotion with which theHome Guard, the Civil Defence Services and the Active Air Defences of GreatBritain have fulfilled their task of guarding this island base on which the wholeundertaking in Western Europe depends.8. In the Mediterranean, maintaining the advance which began atEl Alamein, the Forces of the United Nations have by Jrard and determinedfighting driven the enemy from Rome and reached the Northern plains of Italy.9. In Burma, My troops of the Fourteenth Army, including units of MyAfrican Colonial forces and helped by My Allies from the United States and china, have turned the attempted Japanese invasion of India into a disastrousiretreat. In this campaign My Indian Forces have contributed brilliantly to thedefence of their country.10. In all these victories My Air Forces, fighting in the closest association with the Air Forces of My Allies, have played a conspicuous part. They haveeverywhere engaged the enemy with confidence and courage and their sustained
and gallant attacks in Western Europe, in co-operation with the air forces ofMy American Ally, opened the way for the successful invasion of theContinent, ....y. My Navies have been heavily and continuously engaged throughout theworld. In conjunction with My Air Forces they have gained great successesagainst those enemy submarines and surface craft which have dared to show themselves. The safe passage of the vast invasion convoys for the assault onthe shores of Western Europe was successfully achieved and My Navies continueto maintain the flow of supplies to My Armies as well as to ensure the safe andtimely arrival of the food and material on which the life and work of My peopledepend. This would not have been accomplished without the splendid braveryof My merchant seamen and those of the United Nations and Denmark.12. It has given Me particular pleasure to have been able to visit My Navies,Armies and Air Forces both in Western Europe and in the Mediterranean.13. Resounding victories have continued to reward the skill and valourof My Russian Allies, whose advances have carried them into Eastern Germanyand brought to an end the German domination of South-Eastern Europe.14. In. the Pacific theatre of war My United States Allies, valiantlysupported by My Australian and New Zealand Forces, have rapidly advancedacross vast spaces of the ocean and have broken into the outer defences of Japan.15. The victories achieved and the successful invasion of the Continenthave been made possible by the tireless effort and inventive genius of all thosewho have planned, produced and transported the manifold types of equipment and munitions of war for My Forces and who have maintained the services essential to the prosecution of the war. Our farmers and agricultural workers and the courageous men of the fishing fleets have toiled without respite to providefood for My people, and, in the Forces, in trade and industry, in voluntary service and in the home, women have continued to make their invaluablecontribution to the war effort.16. The civil population and the Police, Fire and Civil Defence services have again shown those qualities of courage and fortitude which earned theadmiration of the world in 1940 and 1941. The sympathies of the Queen and myself extend .to all those who have suffered as a result of the enemy&apos;s attacks,and We are. thankful that the advance of My Forces on the Continent, has put an end to the shelling of the South-East Coast and reduced the enemy&apos;s capacity to launch attacks by flying-bombs.17. I rejoice at the freeing of the territory of My Allies in France, Belgium,Luxembourg, Greece and Yugoslavia, and My sympathy goes out to the Dutchpeople in their present ordeal. It is My earnest hope that before long deliverancewill have come to the whole of occupied Europe.18. In every occupied country the enemy has been increasingly harassedby the resistance of the oppressed peoples and I have&apos; watched with warmadmiration the great part which the French Forces of the Interior have playedin ridding their country of the invader.19. My Government have welcomed the establishment in France of a provisional Government, which will govern the country in accordance with the laws of the Republic until general elections can be held. It is their intentionto work in close co-operation with that Government in regard to the problemsof the future security and reconstruction of Europe.20. It is the earnest desire of My Government to promote peaceful co-operation among the nations of the world, and to this end my officials have hadimportant conversations with officials of the United States, the Soviet Union andthe Republic of China which have resulted in the submission to each of the four governments concerned of agreed suggestions for the formation of aninternational organisation designed to maintain peace and security.21. My Government were represented at the twenty-sixth session of theInternational Labour Conference and at the second council meeting of the united nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and My officials have taken part in the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference.22. My Government have concluded an agreement with the Governmentsof other maritime United Nations, ensuring through a United Maritime Authority
that their combined shipping resources shall continue to be &quot;available for the prosecution and completion of the war in Europe and the Far East and all thepurposes of the United Nations.23. The need for an enlightened international settlement under which civil air transport will flourish as an aid to prosperity and peace continues to engagethe attention of My Ministers. Further discussions have been held withrepresentatives from other parts of My Commonwealth and Empire, and theMinister for Civil Aviation has headed a delegation to&apos; an international conference convened by the United States of America.Members of the House of Commons :24. I thank you for the provision which you have made towards the costof the war. The heavy financial sacrifices which My people have continued tomake during the fifth year of the war have been an essential and outstandingfactor in our war effort.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons :25. Although the successful prosecution of the war has been first in thethoughts of My people and My Government, progress has been made with plans for the resettlement of the men and women who during the war have beenemployed in the various forms of national&apos;service, and for the reconversion ofindustry from war production to the production of goods for the needs of my people and for export.26. I have given My Assent to a number of measures which have beenbrought before you during the course of the year.27. A comprehensive Act has been passed to reform the law relating to education in England and Wales in all its aspects, and to promote its progressive development at all stages. This measure will open up new opportunities to theindividual, and will secure to the future service of the community the fullestadvantage from the resources that lie in the character and capacity of My people.28. Measures have been passed to provide for the rehabilitation and re-entry into employment of disabled persons and for the reinstatement in their civil employment of men and women in the Services, to facilitate the building ofhouses, to improve water supply and sewerage in rural- areas, and to provide forthe redevelopment of war damaged and obsolescent areas and regulate the priceof acquisition of land for public purposes.29. Legislation has also been passed to establish a Ministry of social insurance, to increase the rates of unemployment insurance benefit, to set up:permanent machinery for the redistribution of Parliamentary constituencies and provide for an immediate redistribution of abnormally large constituencies andto assist the herring industry.30. My Government have outlined the policy which they propose to followwith a view to the maintenance of a high and stable level of employment afterthe war. They have also published for examination and discussion proposalsfor a national health service, for a comprehensive system of social insurance and a new scheme of industrial injury insurance, and for a national water policy.31. With you, I thank Almighty God for the victories which have beengranted to us during the past year, and I pray that His blessing may attend youat all times.

In Western Europe My Forces from the United Kingdom and canada and their comrades from the United States, With the invaluable assistance of the peoples who have risen to meet them, have routed the enemy in a series ofdecisive battles and are now pressing him on the borders of his own country. in italy the Forces of the United Nations&apos;have, advanced to the northern plainsand in Greece and Yugoslavia the Germans are being driven from the countrieswhich they have oppressed for three long years. In the East the massiveachievements of My Russian Ally have deprived the Germans of vast stretchesof territory which they hoped would feed their armies and provide an impassablebarrier to prevent the soil of Germany from becoming a battle-ground. Both inthe East and in the West, Germany has been invaded. The plight in which herarmies now find themselves is a measure of the success which by God&apos;s grace hascrowned our arms. In the war against Japan the enemy has been thrown back from India and My American Ally continues to reduce the shrinking area still under Japanese control in the Pacific. My Government intend to reinforce as rapidly and powerfully as possible the United Kingdom Forces who are nowsharing with their comrades from all parts of the British Commonwealth and empire and from the United States, China, the Netherlands ano x) raiice theburden of the struggle against Japan. My Navies have continued to strengthen their hold upon the enemy and have achieved great successes, in which My AirForces have fully shared, in driving his surface and submarine forces from these as. My Air Forces, in concert with the Air Forces of My United States Ally,have delivered increasingly heavy blows against Germany and have maintained their support of military and naval operations in all theatres.2.
