THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.    /secret.P. (44) 632.10th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.INDIANS IN SOUTH AFRICA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I have circulated recent telegrams from the Government of India relatingto the dispute with South Africa over the recent anti-Asiatic legislation in Natal.I append a memorandum explanatory of the history of the dispute andof the retaliatory measures taken and proposed by the Government of India.I am consulting the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs to see whether any effective action can be taken from here to intervene in this unfortunate affair.A regrettable effect of the dispute is that it will stiffen the Governmentof India&apos;s objections to the operation from bases in India of the South AfricanAir Squadrons which, in response to an invitation from here, Field-marshal smuts has agreed to transfer to South-East Asia Command.L.S. A. .India Office, 10th November, 1944.Proposed Retaliation by Government of India against Union of&apos;South Africa in the Matter of Treatment of Indians.1. The present dispute primarily affects Natal, in which the Indianpopulation is approximately 202,000 and the European population about 200,000.According to the 1936 Census, approximately 80,500 of the Natal Indians livedin Durban, the European population of which in the same year was 88,000.2. In 1939 the late General Hertzog&apos;s Government proposed to introduce legislation of general application throughout the Union providing, for separateresidential areas for Europeans and Asiatics. (A similar measure, known as the asiatic or Areas Bill, had been introduced by General Hertzog&apos;s Governmentin 1925, but had been withdrawn as the result of a negotiated agreement, knownas the Cape Town Agreement, which governed the relations of Europeans andIndians in the Union from 1927 to 1938-39.) The Hertzog proposals of 1939 ledto a complete deadlock in India-Union relations, which was broken only by thefall of the Hertzog Government in September 1939. The main proposals werenot passed into law, but what came to be known as the Interim Act of 1939 (the transvaal Asiatic Land and Trading Act) was passed, the purpose of which wasto prohibit till 1941 the sale or hire of property and the issue of new trade licences to Indians in the Transvaal.3. On coming into power in September 1939 the Smuts government announced that they would not proceed with legislation for the segregation of indians during the war, and that a Commission of Enquiry would be appointedto ascertain the facts about Indian penetration into European areas. In themeantime, steps would be taken on a voluntary basis to prevent further Indianpenetration. In accordance with this policy, a Commission of Enquiry wasappointed in May 1940 under Justice Broome. This Commission reported inJuly 1941 that, while there was no substantial Indian penetration in the transvaal, there had been considerable penetration in the Durban municipal area.[28565]
4. After the publication of the Broome Report, anti-Indian sentiment inthe Union was fanned by widespread rumours that Indian penetration on a large scale had taken place in Durban since July 1941. As*a consequence, JusticeBroome was again called upon to conduct an Enquiry, and he reported, in March1943, that the allegations were true. The number of sites acquired during 1942was two and a half times greater than the highest previous yearly total, that for1939. During the first two months of 1943 Indians paid more for sites in european areas than during any complete year dealt with by the previousCommission, and the amount so paid by Indians during the twenty-nine monthscovered by Justice Broome&apos;s second report did not fail far short of the total amount so paid during the whole of the thirteen complete years covered by theprevious Commission. Following the second Broome Report, the Union Govern-ment immediately introduced a Bill with the twofold purpose of extending the interim Act of 1939 and preventing further transfers of property in Durban.This Bill became law on the 28th April, 1943, as the Trading and Occupationof Land (Transvaal and Natal) Restriction Act, usually known as the&apos;&apos; Pegging &apos;&apos; Act.5. The purpose of the Pegging Act, described by Field-Marshal Smuts asa &quot; standstill &quot; measure, was primarily to prevent further acquisitions of&quot;property by Asiatics in Durban for three years, pending an enquiry by a judicialCommission. This enquiry is at present being conducted under the chairmanship of Justice Broome. The Pegging Act caused widespread agitation in India and,as in 1939, insistent demands were made both in the Legislature and in the press for retaliatory measures against the Union.6. As it was clear that the enforcement of the Pegging Act would lead toa serious breach of relations between India and the Union, Field-Marshal Smutshimself intervened in the dispute prior to his visit to this country last April.At a meeting in Pretoria between himself, the Minister of the Interior, and adeputation from the Natal-Indian Congress, it was agreed that legislation should be &quot;introduced in the Natal Provincial Council to provide for a joint boardof five, composed of two Europeans, two Asiatics, with a European Chairman,the function of which would be to license the occupation of dwellings in Natalmunicipal areas. On the passing of this measure the Pegging Act would be withdrawn.7. A draft Natal Ordinance embodying the Pretoria Agreement was published on the 2nd June.. It purported to make provision &quot; for the licensing,regulation and control of the occupation for residential purposes of dwellings by persons of certain racial groups in boroughs and townships.&apos;.&apos; The Ordinancewas to apply to Durban, and to any other borough and township to which its provisions might be applied by the Administrator of Natal. The first reactions in India to the Pretoria Agreement were not unfavourable, but soon considerable opposition developed among Indians in South Africa to those who had partici-pated in the Agreement, and still greater opposition became evident on the partof the more extreme Europeans. This latter opposition has been so formidableas to make it impossible for the Ordinance to be passed as originally drafted.A Select Committee of the Natal Legislature has now amended it so as to make its provisions applicable to the acquisition as well as to the occupation of residential property, and to extend it to boroughs and townships generally inNatal, and the Ordinance as amended has passed a third reading. This draftOrdinance as amended has been denounced by Indians in the Union and by theGovernment of India as a breach of the Pretoria Agreement, The Union Govern-ment, however, contend that there has been no breach of the spirit of theAgreement. The contention appears to be true as regards the extension of the ordinance throughout Natal, for which provision was made in the first draft; butthe extension of the proposed legislation to acquisition as well as to occupationappears to go beyond the Agreement. The Union Government feel, however, thatthe Ordinance in this form represents the furthest extent to which it is possiblepolitically for them to go, in view of the attitude of European opinion in SouthAfrica. Meantime, the agitation in India has spread to all grievances of indians in the Union, including the franchise.8. In 1943, the Indian Legislature, influenced mainly by developments inSouth Africa, passed a Reciprocity Act, the purpose of which was to empower the Government of India to impose certain disabilities (in respect to entry travel,the possession of property, carrying on business, and the franchise) on persons in
India belonging to countries where similar disabilities are imposed on Indians.Under the Constitution, the Government of India cannot take action in respectto the franchise, and a request that the Act of 1935 should be amended to give them the necessary powers was refused by the Secretary of State for India inSeptember 1944, on the ground that as a matter of policy he was not preparedto promote legislation in Parliament for the express purpose of enabling theGovernment of India to discriminate in regard to the franchise against personsdomiciled in other parts of the Commonwealth. The Government of India have,however, by Gazette notification, taken power under the Reciprocity Act to(    proceed in other respects against South African nationals in India.9. The Government of India wish also to retaliate against the Union bydenouncing the existing non-discriminatory Trade Agreement between SouthAfrica and India and to use the freedom so given&apos; to prohibit trade between thetwo countries. Denunciation at three months&apos; notice is legally and conventionallywithin the power of the Government of India. Its immediate effects when thethree months&apos; notice expires are : (i) that Indian goods cease to be entitled tofavourable tariff rates in the Union, and (ii) that both sides are free to dis-criminate. If the second power were fully exercised by India it would deprive the war effort in India during the first half of 1945 of 26,000 tons of tanningmaterials, 4,650 tons of copper wire, 2,640 tons of calcium carbide, 1,300 tons offluorspar, 900 tons of civil explosives and 220 tons of copal. These items, allessential to the maintenance of India&apos;s war effort, comprise all but 3,000 tons(of which 1,200 tons are transhipment goods) of the provisional shipping pro-gramme for the first half of 1945. In the other direction, exports from India tothe Union for 1943-4 (the best figures available) were valued at 9-9 crores ofrupees, the main items being jute goods, cotton manufactures and oilseeds.Details of the trade are set out in an Appendix. It is difficult to estimate the degree of injury either to the war effort or to civil amenity in the Union includingthe welfare of resident Indians that would result from cessation of exports from india. It would clearly be substantial. It is, however, abundantly clear that the injury to the war effort in India resulting from cessation of imports from theUnion would be serious, for, even where alternative sources are available, it mayembarrass His Majesty&apos;s Government seriously to be obliged to find them for the express purpose of facilitating a trade war within the Empire.
