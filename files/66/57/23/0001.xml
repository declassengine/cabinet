THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT        /&apos;/Printed for the War Cabinet,  November 1944.    &apos; X/STOP SECRET.Copy. No.36W.P. (44) 623.6th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.CONTROLS IN THE TRANSITION.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.I suggest the following Question and Answer : -Q. To ask the Prime Minister if he can make a statement about thecontinuance of controls after the end of the German war.A. It is not possible to look beyond the end of the Japanese war, and myreply relates to the period between the defeat of Germany and the defeat of Japanor three years, whichever ends first.Until Japan has been defeated the war must have first call on our efforts.After the defeat of Germany it will be possible and necessary to turn over an increasing part of our resources to civilian production. There will also be a difficult stage after all the wars are over. Thus we must make exertions to restore our export trade and to re-equip our industry.. The shortage of houses,both permanent and emergency, must be grappled with as if it were a war-timemeasure. Active steps must be taken to make up the shortage of civilian goods.As stated in the White Paper published to-day. the existing system of allocating man-power to the Forces and to the various industries will be main-tained. Nevertheless, it is intended to mitigate so far as possible the rigidityof the existing controls over labour.Many of the war-time controls over raw materials, industrial capacity,agriculture, food and so forth will likewise be as necessary in this period as theyare to-day.   In these fields also, relaxations will be possible and will be made
whenever circumstances permit and in an orderly manner. Any other course would -result in violent disturbances which might well lead to inflation; would be harmfulto tjie economic life of the country; and would make it impossible to ensure thatthe Nation&apos;s resources are devoted to essential needs, and are fairly distributedduring periods in which demand will still be without any economic relation tosupply.It is too early to -forecast the stages by which control will be relaxed. Butthe House can rest assured that the whole matter will be dealt with in a severelypractical manner, each case being considered not only on its merits but as part )of an organised scheme. It is important in this phase that theoretical, ideologicalor partisan tendencies either way should be excluded, and the governingconsideration in every case should be the public interest.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S. W. 1,Qth November, 1944.
