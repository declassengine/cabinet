THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVEBNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 611.1st November, 1944.COMPARATIVE PERFORMANCES OF BRITISH AND AMERICANCIVIL  TRANSPORT  AIRCRAFTNote by the Secretary op State for Air and the Minister of aircraft Production.1. We were asked by the War Cabinet at their Meeting on the 1st September(W.M. (44) 114th Conclusions, Minute 3, Conclusion (4)) to submit a Reportcomparing the British and United States types of aircraft now being designed and manufactured for civil purposes. We were also asked to deal in the report with the question whether the British designs were adequate, and to embody init the considered views of B.O.A.C.The Complexity of the Problem.2. The compilation of a Report setting out the information asked for in areadily intelligible form is not easy. Thus, no true comparison can be drawn between one type of aircraft and another unless both types have been built to thesame specification. This hardly ever occurs in practice. Further, aircraft arecomplex mechanisms having complex functions. Speed cannot be compared withspeed without at the same time being related to operating height, range and operational cost. Similarly, range cannot be compared with range, nor payloadwith payload, without account being taken of other relevant factors. No systemof marking has yet been devised that would yield a quick and simple answer.Basis of the Comparison.3. In the circumstances it has seemed to us that tihe essential characteristics of representative American types as compared with the corresponding british types can most clearly be set out in five categories based on the following basicoperational requirements v (a) a still air range of 5,000 statute miles for a service from London to new york direct;(b) a still air range of 4,000 statute miles for a trans-Atlantic service witha stop in Newfoundland;(e) a still air range of 2,400 statute miles for medium-stage Empire services;(d) a still air range of 1,000 statute miles for European and feeder lineservices;(e) a still air range of 500 statute miles for short-stage services.The five comparative tables prepared on this basis and a short general summaryare reproduced at Appendix A to this Paper. (A more detailed Paper preparedby the technical staff at M.A.P. is also reproduced at Appendix C.)4. In general, these tables show that, subject to the comments in paragraph6 below, the Brabazon list of requirements, type by type, needs no revision. Itmust hot, however, be forgotten that the American types are considerably more advanced in time than ours. It is accordingly essential that work on the Brabazontypes should proceed as rapidly as possible. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that (i) there is no recognised official exchange of views between this countryand the United States about new civil types.   Consequently, informa-tion about American type&quot;s is difficult to come by and must be treated with reserve; and[28506] copy No.WAR CABINET.
(ii) none of the seven Brabazon types yet exists.   Accordingly, the figuresfor the British types repiesent the best attempt that can be made to forecast their performance, on the assumption that, when built, they0 will   at   least   meet   the   Brabazon   Committee&apos;s   list   of   users&apos;requirements.Comments of B.O.A.C.5. B.O.A.C. are represented on the Brabazon Committee. Their comments on the Brabazon types are set out in the note reproduced at Appendix B. Brieflythese are :  (i) The interior arrangements of the Brabazon type I should be modified,without structural alteration, so as to increase the passenger capacity and make it possible for the aircraft to accommodate the larger pay-load which will be available if a stop is made in Newfoundland onthe service between the United Kingdom and New York,(ii) Given (i) above, it will not be necessary for the Brabazon Type IIIato have the range to operate across the North Atlantic. Accordingly,Types IIIa and IIIb should be rolled into one, and a new Type IIIproduced with, inter alia, a cruising speed of 300 miles an hour.(iii) The Brabazon Type II which is not expected to be available until 1948is no . great improvement on the Curtiss-Wright Commando, largenumbers of which will be available at the end of the war.(iv) A British type in the class of the &apos;DC-3 is urgently required.(v) The Brabazon Type IV (jet propelled) should be developed as early aspossible, as a matter of prestige, and to establish a lead in this new field of development.Our Comments on the views of B.O.A .C.G.&apos;  Our comments on B.O.A.C.&apos;s views are as follows : (i) It is clearly desirable that the Brabazon Type I should be suitable both for the direct service, London-New York, and for a stopping serviceacross the North Atlantic.   This will be pursued,(ii) The thin Tudor will enable the B.O.A.C. to maintain a stopping serviceacross the Atlantic until the Brabazon Type I is ready.(iii) The effect of (i) and (ii) combined is to make less urgent the need for aBrabazon Type IIIa, the characteristics of which had primarily been determined by the range requirement for a North Atlantic servicecalling in Newfoundland.(iv) We recently agreed that as the Brabazon Type IIIb is no great improve-ment on the fat-bodied Tudor, a contract for its development should notbe placed now, but that the specification should be reviewed in thelight of progress in, say, a year&apos;s time.(v) It was our intention that a contract for the development of Type IIIashould be placed with Avros in some three months&apos; time when theirdesign shop had cleared the fat and thin Tudors. The BrabazonCommittee have considered as a matter of urgency whether they wishto change their previous recommendation about Type IIIa in the lightof the comments of B.O.A.C. They have accepted the B.O.A.C.recommendations and Avros have been instructed to go ahead on thenew - specification.(vi) It was the original view of the Brabazon Committee that as largenumbers of Dakotas (the military version of the D.C. 3) will be avail-able for sale at the end of the war at disposal prices and as no new typein this class would, at the present stage of development, mark a reallysubstantial advance on the D.C. 3 no British counterpart of the D.C. 3should be developed at present, but that we should concentrate insteadon an aircraft of the maximum size suitable for two available air-cooled engines. The question whether the Brabazon Type II on whichdesign work has started should be allowed to proceed has been exploredinterdepartmentally and by the Brabazon Committee. As this typeshows definite promise of superiority over the corresponding American. type it has been decided that it should be proceeded with,(vii) The need for an additional type midway between Types Va and Type IIis being closely investigated in the light of technical possibilities andof users&apos; expressed requirements.
(viii) We agree that a jet-propelled aircraft on the lines of the BrabazonType IV should be produced as soon as possible. De Havillands havealready been selected to undertake this work.Effect of the greater resources of the United States Aircraft Industry.7. There is one final point. Only one firm has so far been allotted to eachof the Brabazon types on which work has started. The Americans, on the otherhand, with the much larger resources at their disposal, have two or three, stringsto their bow in each of the categories referred to in paragraph 8 above. It is most unlikely that the design resources of the British industry, even whenreinforced by the 500 additional designers for whom we are asking, will be ableat present to undertake more than seven or eight Brabazon types, in additionto the converted transport types and the military programme. The wiser coursewould probably be not to duplicate work on the Brabazon types but to plan now for the design of additional Brabazon types as soon as war commitments will allow, without prejudice to making the best of the types now agreed.(a) Category by category, the Brabazon types compare well with those whichare now being developed in the United States of America.(b) The American types are, however, more advanced in time than ours andit is essential that work on the Brabazon types should proceed as quickly as our war commitments allow.(c) The proposal to merge Types IIIa and IIIb into a single Type III,which would have, inter alia, a cruising speed of 300 miles per hour,has been agreed in the light of the comments of B.O.A.C. It hasalso been decided to proceed on the Brabazon Type II. The need foran additional type midway between Types Va and II is beingconsidered.(d) It is must unlikely that, with the resources available, more than one.firmcan be allocated at present to each of the Brabazon types. The wisercourse would be to plan for work to start on additional Brabazontypes as soon as war commitments will allow, without prejudice to making the best of the types now agreed.8.Summary.To sum up, the position is that: A.

APPENDIX BRecommendations by British Overseas Airways Corporation for revision ofBrabazon Programme for design of Transport Aircraft.Because of the limited capacity of the British aircraft industry forthe design of transport aircraft, and the consequent delay in implementing therecommendations of the Second Brabazon Committee for the types most urgently required by B.O.A.C., the following general revision of the programme is recommended, having regard to the urgency of the situation revealed by the latest information about American competition.Brabazon I.North Atlantic Services: (Class I and II Routes).The interior arrangements to be modified without structural alteration,so as to increase passenger capacity and carry the larger payload, which willbecome available if the aircraft is operated on the North Atlantic route with afuelling stop at Gander. This type will thus serve both the London/New Yorknon-stop service and the London/New York service with a stopover at Gander, atthe same time being generally more economical.As the result, the present range requirement to enable Brabazon IIIa to operate the North Atlantic service can be deleted, but Tudor I will continue tobe the only British aircraft on this service until Brabazon I is introduced.Brabazon IIIa and IIIb.Empire and South Atlantic Services : (Class II and III Routes).Without one of these types the Corporation will have only the Tudor II tomeet impending competition on these routes from aircraft such as the DC-4,DC-6 and Constellation, and perhaps the DC-7.Because of the overwhelming importance of the Empire services, and in orderto concentrate our limited design facilities, the Corporation recommends mergingBrabazon IIIa and IIIb into one type, for which the following conditions mustbe imposed :: .(1) The aircraft must be ready for service at the earliest possible moment.(2) It will have to be of conventional design, but generally superior to its competitors. Its still air range requirement is now reduced from theoriginal figure of 4,100 to 3,500 still air miles, and the aircraft must also be able to operate efficiently on ranges downwards to 2,000 still airmiles.  (3) Its maximum cruising speed must be at least 300 miles an hour at20,000 feet.(4) Its payload capacity must include 25 passengers in sleeping berths tothe required dimensions. These will be stated, together with theother key dimensions such as numbers of crew, capacity for freightand mail, &amp;c.(5) The aircraft must be thoroughly up-to-date in every detail and have a.tricycle undercarriage.A suggested outline or requirements for a revised Brabazon III is attached here to.   (See Annex attached.)Brabazon Type II.Secondary or Short Stage Services : (Class IV Routes).The Corporation has already recorded its objections to Brabazon II, and it now appears that Airspeeds prototype will not fly until 1948. Meanwhile, largenumbers of Curtiss Wright &apos;&apos; &quot;Commandos &apos;&apos; are likely to come on the market at adisposal price, and such advanced conceptions as the Douglas DC-9 are reported,the aim in the United States being to find a replacement for the DC-3, whichshall be smaller, more economical and faster, and yet do the same job.The market for this type is world-wide and probably represents the biggestone of all for the British aircraft industry. Many British operators will have to fill this requirement, which in general terms should be for an aircraft to carry a
total payload of about 6,000 lbs., including 20 to 24 passengers within the DC-3standard of seating dimensions, over stages not exceeding 600 miles at a speed of.at least 200 m.p!h. at 10,000 ft.At the present time B.O.A.C. has no British aircraft in sight to fill the gap in its requirements between an aircraft of the size of Brabazon II and the VA.This gap is specially serious because (a) The Airspeed 57 will not be available until 1948, and even then, apartfrom certain other disadvantages, will have a performance littledifferent from that of the revised Commando, which is due in themiddle of 1945.(b) B.O.A.C. must remain dependent for its European and other short stageservices on Dakotas until either a 20/24-seater new type or the brabazon II is produced. Lease-Lend complications may make this position even more difficult.It is requested, therefore, that further consideration should be given to this problem and how it can be overcome, bearing in mind that the Airspeed 57 is stillin a very early stage of design.Brabazon Type IV.Jet and Gas Turbine Development.The Corporation recommends that a Type IV, embodying the very latestknowledge, be produced at the earliest possible moment as a matter of prestige,and to establish a lead in this development. Its commercial efficiency and operational range are of secondary importance.In the interests of all British air line operators and of the British aircraft industry the Corporation attaches the highest importance and urgency to theproduction of such an aircraft upon which its own success may well depend in theearly post-war years; it is therefore prepared to back this development to theutmost.Uth October, 1944.Annex.Brabazon III (Revised).Introduction.Draft Outline Requirements.1. An aircraft is required for any major overseas route other than the north atlantic, whose average stage can be operated with fuel for 2,750 still air statutemiles.2. When introduced on to service the aircraft must be superior in all generalrespects to its American competitors at that date, particularly in speed.3. Its accommodation will include sleeping berths, and shall offer comfortappropriate to continuous day and night travel between United Kingdom and NewZealand for 25 passengers together with a quantity of baggage, mail and freightwhich shall be stated. It is not intended that the crew, which shall be of the smallest number of officers feasible, will sleep on board. On such routes as UnitedKingdom-New Zealand crews will operate sections of the route in relays.4. Cruising speed shall be at least 300 m.p.h. at 20,000 ft. at an engineoutput which will permit a running life between overhauls of as much above700 hours as possible.5. The normal cruising height shall be 20,000 ft. where the cabin shall bepressurised to the equivalent of 8,000 ft. The pressurisation system shall be such that the equivalent rate of climb within the cabin shall not exceed 500 ft./minute while the aircraft is at its best operational rate of climb. Whilst climbingat such rate in tropical climates the cabin temperature shall not be excessive for passengers.6. Fuel and oil tankage shall be sufficient for a maximum still air range of3,500 statute miles at an engine output compatible with 4.7. The aircraft shall comply with British airworthiness regulations, andshall be designed expressly to suit the wide variety of operational conditions andairports which will be encountered on these routes.
Importance is attached to stalling speed (which shall be defined) and handlingqualities, both in approaching and landing as well as on the ground.8. Delivery to the Corporation of the aircraft in reasonable quantity and ina thoroughly proved and serviceable condition is required at the earliestpossible date. Because of its relative importance to the Corporation, and in viewof impending competition from foreign operators on the overseas routes thehighest priority should be given to the type.9. An appendix of key dimensions and weight allowances for passengers andcrew will be issued. Certain essential design features such as tricycle and under-carriages and duplicated wheels will be prescribed, and the makers, will be expectedto fit the most-up-to-date accessories and instruments available anywhere.Uth October, 1944.APPENDIX C.10th October, 1944.COMPARISON OE BRITISH AND AMERICAN AIR TRANSPORTSNOW BEING DESIGNED OR FLYING.Memorandum by the Director of Technical Development, Ministry of aircraft Production.Contents.Report, with conclusions.Appendix 1. Details of aircraft compared.Appendix 2. Comparison of loads and ranges.Appendix 3. Passenger comfort and accommodation.Appendix 4. Comparison of aircraft structure weights.Appendix 5. Efficiency of British and American engines for air transport purposes.Appendix 6. Modern developments.Comparison of British and American Air Transports now being Designedor Flying.1. For the purpose of this comparison all the information available on thelatest British and American transports has been analysed. Details of the aircraftcompared are at Appendix 1. From the operators point of view the salient features are the operating efficiency of the aircraft in terms, of payload, range,speed and operating cost in conjunction with ease of maintenance and service-ability. The passenger, on the other hand, apart from the fare question, is more interested in speed, comfort and accommodation, and the service and catering hemay expect. These aspects are discussed first and are followed by a comparison of the design features and technical quality of British and American transportsin &quot;terms of structure weights, engine efficiencies and modern developments. Themain results of the analysis are given below, and the figures and technical discussions on which these results are based are attached in the form of a seriesof appendices.2. Operating Efficiency over Specified Ranges.Detailed comparisons of British and American types over appropriate rangesas given at Appendix 2. Our knowledge of the Dominator (XC99) is not complete,but the evidence we have shows the Brabazon 1 to compare closely with it butto be much further frpm completion. The Constitution could operate over the5,000-miles routes, but the Brabazon 1 with its &quot;greater payload would be themore efficient. Over 4,000 miles range the Brabazon 1 would show high returnsin ton-miles per gallon of fuel. It would meet strong competition from theConstitution and DC7, but -as far as the North Atlantic route is concerned theAmerican aircraft would not be suitably powered. The Brabazon 3A can operate[28506] r.
with nearly 10,000 lb. payload over 4,000 miles, but its returns are higher onshorter routes. Over routes, of the order of 2,400 miles the Brabazon 3A, Tudor 2an/i H.P.68 show good returns in ton miles per gallon; the Constellation andDC4 would be competitors. Although the DC4 has larger payloads than the tudor 2, this results from inadequate provision for pressurisation and lighterpower units on the DC4. As a result the Tudor 2 can cruise 25 m.p.h. fasterand at heights at which the DC4 could not operate. The Brabazon 2 should easilymeet competition from the Curtiss Commando over any ranges appropriate tothis size. Information supplied by the Douglas Company on the Skybus (DC9)looks very optimistic and must be treated with considerable reserve. Brabazon 5A,well engineered, adequately covers this class at 17,000 lb. all-up weight. Againstthe Brabazon 5B would be set the Beechcraft Voyager, and on performanceestimations the 5B is superior. The Shetland flying-boat will compete well withthe Mars (JRM1) in payload and range, and is superior in speed, but the Mars(JRM2) will have increased power and weight and possibly increased speed.It is clear that British technical designs and specifications are up to date and compare well with the American, but unless adequate resources and prioritiesare allotted to implement, improve and extend our present proposals, it is fairlycertain that the existing position will not last into the future.3. Passenger A accommodation.British aircraft are on the whole a little ahead of American in theconsideration of passenger comfort and accommodation. For most aircraftAmerican operators have smaller cubic allowance for day and night passengersthan are shown in existing British layout. In view of the far greater commercialexperience of American operators this difference is significant, bearing in mind that comfort is costly in weight. On American aircraft day passengers havebetween 51 and 56 cubic feet, whilst British aircraft have an allowance of between51 and 65 cubic feet with an average of about 60 cubic feet. Our standards ofsleeper &quot;accommodation are higher than American and, in particular, information on the DC7 indicates that its sleeper allowance would not be acceptable in thiscountry. In airport facilities, steward services and catering, the existingAmerican standard is very high. For successful competition British Air Lineswill have to reach this standard.4. Maintenance and Serviceability.In engine maintenance and serviceability British aircraft will have animportant advantage over American resulting from the British policy of developing complete and easily interchangeable power units. This gives the rolls-Royce Merlin a notable advantage for transport purposes and was the main reason that Trans-Canada Airways chose Merlins for their Canadian-builtDC4&apos;s in preference to Pratt and Whitney engines. On detail design of the airframe and accessibility of ancillary equipment for maintenance purposes.the americans with their greater air line experience are ahead. On maintenanceaspects generally there is every reason to expect the British standard to beultimately as high as the American, since a great part of our accumulatedtechnical design on military aircraft can be applied directly to civil transports.The speed and skill of servicing and maintenance personnel in peace-timecompetition conditions will undoubtedly have to be higher than the existingR.A.F. standards. This, however, is a matter apart from the design problems ofmaintenance and serviceability. For example, British experience on maintenance and serviceability gained with the Lancaster bomber will be incorporated in the tudor 1, Tudor 2, Brabazon 3A, York and Lancaster civil conversion, all of whichare to be built by Avros.Information of the greatest value would be obtained from working mock-upsof transports embodying all maintenance features accurately and completelyworking. This has been done for the Constitution in America. Only by suchmeans can maintenance and servicing problems be met at the earliest design stage and aircraft kept in the air for the maximum possible number of hours fromcommencement of operation.  Our technical policy is directed towards this end.5. Technical Quality of Aircraft Structures and Engines.Analysis of the weights of the main components of the structures of the transports shows no systematic differences between British and Americandesigns. Resulting from their greater resources and fundamentally differentapproach to technical problems, American firms rely more on large-scale develop-
ment testing of actual structures and less on theoretical stressing than is Britishpractice. American firms devote far more attention and resources to weightcontrol and analysis during the design and build-up of the prototype than doBritish firms. In both these respects American methods are likely in the future to lead more quickly to structures of higher efficiency, but we can do muchourselves with greater man-power in the design side of our aircraft industry.These matters have already been given much attention by the Bristol aeroplane company.American engines^are not uniformly lighter than British for the completepower units in lbs./B.H.P., nor is there any systematic difference in specific fuelconsumptions. The range of engines available to American manufacturers is far greater than the British range, and there is particular need at present of aBritish engine of about 800 B.H.P. at take-off; this class of engine is being included in our programme for development engines. Evidence up to the presentshows generally that American civil engines have larger periods of trouble-freerunning than British civil engines, although this does not apply to certainengines, such as the Gipsy and Cheetah class. This may be due to the fact that american engines have been designed and developed for air transport purposes,whereas British engines have been primarily developed for high-performancemilitary aircraft. There is no reason, however, to suggest that British enginescannot be adapted to equal these longer-running periods under commercialrunning conditions.There is no evidence that American transports will incorporate any modernfeature that will not be found in the proposed British transports. Among suchfeatures are pressurisation, thermal de-icing, tricycle undercarriages, laminarflow wings, contra-rotating and reversible pitch propellers, radar aids.6. Conclusions.The following main conclusions result from the analysis, and a fullerdiscussion, together with figures and technical explanation where possible, willbe found in the attached appendices : (a) The British transports how being built or proposed compare well in operating efficiency with American transports flying, or under con-struction, of which we have knowledge. There is no evidence that the brabazon specifications are out of date, or likely to lead to aircraftinferior to the corresponding American types. It must be recognisedthat the Americans have a considerable lead in time (Appendix I),since they laid down their transports some years ago when we were completely occupied with vital war commitments. Unless, therefore,adequate resources and priorities are allotted to fulfil and developBritish proposals, this state of technical equality cannot be expectedto last into the future.(b) The list of American transports is greater than the present Britishprogramme. An obvious gap is between the Brabazon 5A at17,000 lb. and the Brabazon 2 at 45,000 lb. The DC 3 would occupythis gap, and consideration might well be given to a British aircraft of about 30,000 lb., powered with two well-developed Merlin engines.The other gap is between the Brabazon 3A at 120,000 lb. and the brabazon 1 at 250,000 lb. The Constitution at 184,000 lb. and theDC 7 at 145,000 lb. are within this region, and such sizes of aircraft can show high returns in ton/miles per gallon of fuel over ranges ofthe order of 4,000 miles. With our existing limited design capacitythe Type 3A and Type 1 strike the best compromise we can afford.(c) In technical design there is little to choose between British and Americanstructures. The aero-engines of both countries compare closely inefficiency, but British engines are ahead in installation and- inter-changeability of the complete power unit. American engines offer afar wider range of choice to aircraft manufacturers than do Britishengines. American civil engines generally have given longer periodsbetween overhaul than British civil engines in the past. Great efforts are being made to improve this position, and there is evidence thatwe have succeeded with the Merlin.(d) American resources are of such a scale that they are able to adoptmethods, particularly in respect of development testing, likely to givequicker  progress in  the  future  than existing  British  practice.[28506] &quot; c 2
American firms devote far more attention to weight control andanalysis during the build-up of the prototype than do British firms.In both these respects America is ahead of Britain. .* (e) There is considerable leeway to make up in this country in the develop-ment of automatic controls and radio equipment if we are to hold out-own with American equipment that already exists.Appendix 1.Details of Aircraft Compared.The above report is based on a survey of known modern British and Americantransports, and detailed analysis has been made of the following aircraft. TheD.C.3 is included in view of its outstanding success and its wide use. It will alsoserve to show the progress anticipated in American transport.British.			American.		Aircraft.	All-up wt. (lb.).

Flying.Information, particularly on the American types, is far from complete.Treasonable estimates have been made where necessary. All up weights are some-times quoted differing from the above, and the version has been chosen for analysison which we had the most reliable information. For example the D.C.4A willfly at 73,000 lb., and both Tudors will probably fly at 75,000 lb. Brabazon typenot brought into the comparison is Type 3B which was considered sufficientlycovered by Tudor 1, Tudor 2 and H.P.68 Aircraft powered by jet or gas turbineengines are not considered in the present report, and Type 4 is therefore not included.Appendix 2.Comparison of Loads and Ranges.The figures in the table overleaf show the performance of the aircraft for specified ranges. British and American aircraft that might be expected to operate over the same routes are grouped together and the pay loads shown overthe specified range. In order to obtain a measure of the operating efficiency of the aircraft the ton-miles per gallon of fuel have been calculated in all cases.It is of course difficult to estimate the ultimate efficiency of an aircraft until itsoperating all-up weight is, known, since aircraft generally &quot; mature &quot; to an all-upweight considerably above the prototype or design figure. The airworthinessregulations that will ultimately prevail in the two countries will influence this.It is evident that there is no systematic difference between American andBritish Aircraft in disposable load. The low figure of 32-8 per cent, for the tudor 2 arises from its heavy body and large allowance for furnishings. TheShetland is superior to the Mars (JBMl) in disposable load. The payloads overthe ranges stated differ widely and do not provide a firm basis of comparisonsince they are dependent not only on the available disposable load but also onthe assumed aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft. Comparing the DC4with the Tudor 2, the American aircraft has a payload more than 3,000 lb. greaterthan the British, although its all-up weight is less.   The difference is due to the
Tudor 2 having a heavy body, being pressurised, and having heavier allowances for furnishings, and to the lighter power units of the DG4. In any event theDC4 is under-powered and is not intended for high altitude operation. TheConstellation is regarded as the only serious American competitor to the DC4,and at an all-up weight of 82,000 lb., its relative performance is in no waysuperior to the Tudors or HP68, and both Tudor aircraft will ultimately operate at greater all-up weights than those quoted. There is to be an attempt to increasethe all-up weight of the Constellation to 93,000 lb., with consequent increasedpayload, but as far as our knowledge goes, this has not yet been achieved, andin any event corresponding weight increases are likely in due course for theBritish transports. The difference between the disposable load of the Skybusand Brabazon 5A is largely attributable to the power units quoted for the two aircrafts, that for the Skybus being about 1,200 lb. lighter.For the largest class of aircraft operating over 5,000 miles the Brabazon 1is superior in payload and ton-miles per gallon to the Constitution. our information on the Dominator payload and range is incomplete, but from the data we have this aircraft should be very comparable with the Brabazon 1. Overranges of 4,000 miles, of which the North Atlantic route is probably the mostimportant, the large aircraft such as the Brabazon 1, Constitution and DC 7show the best returns in ton-miles per gallon. The American aircraft are, how-ever, possibly not suitably powered for operating at heights up to 25,000 ft. whichthe North Atlantic route requires. The Tudor 1 was intended as a quickly-pro-duced aircraft to do the North Atlantic crossing, and its low payload has alwaysbeen realised. There is no landplane being considered at present in this countrybetween the Brabazon 3A at 120,000 lb. and the Brabazon 1 at 250,000 lb. Itis suggested that consideration is merited of an aircraft to fill the gap to givebest returns over ranges of the order of 4,000 miles. A weight of about 160,000 lb.appears suitable, but with existing rather restricted range of British .enginesthere may be difficulty in selecting the optimum power units.Over Empire routes of about 2,400 miles British Transports will be wellrepresented by the Brabazon 3A, the Tudor 2, and the HP.68, particularly whenthe two latter aircraft mature to greater all-up weights than those shown. TheConstellation would be a powerful competitor.The Brabazon 2 should show good return in ton miles per gallon over the shorter Empire and European routes, and it should surpass the obvious Americancompetitor in the Curtis Commando. The British programme has an appreciablegap between the Brabazon 2 at 45,000 lb. and the Brabazon 5A at 17,000 lb.,which the Americans could bridge by the DC 3 at 25,000 lb. An aircraft of about 30,000 lb. powered with two well-developed Merlin engines would fill the gap in the British range and give good returns in ton-miles per gallon forranges up to about 1,000 miles. At the same time it is appreciated that such an aircraft would meet most severe competition from any improved version ofthe DC.3.The smaller Brabazon Types 5A and 5B should be most successful com-mercial types, and if the expectations of the 5B are realised it should be wellahead of such American types as the Beechcraft Voyager.

Ton-miles per gall, for Brabazon 1 are good, but an aircraft of 140,000/ 180,000-lb. also gives high returns. The high figure for ton-miles per gall, for Brabazon 3A should be noted. Brabazon 2 gives excellent returns over this range. Brabazon 5B should be superior to Voyager to a marked extent.
Appendix 3.Passenger Comfort and Accommodation.A comparison of the Brabazon types with latest American aircraft, such asConstitution, Constellation, DC7, DC4, and the Skybus, indicates that we arenot behind America in the consideration given to passenger comfort and accommodation. The Americans have had by far the greater experience of passenger requirements for day and night travel, but we in this country have kept in touch with American practice and modified in specifying our own requirements.The cubic allowance per day passenger on the American aircraft quotedvaries between about 51 cu. ft. and 56 cu. ft. Generally, the corresponding Britishfigures for the Brabazon Types are higher. Thus, Brabazon 1 will have 65 cu. ft.per passenger, even when carrying 102 day passengers on such routes as london to Cairo. Brabazon 2 will have 61 cu. ft. per passenger in the first-class version,carrying 28; and 51 cu. ft. in the second-class version, carrying 39. The Tudor 2strikes a good standard at 60 cu. ft. per passenger when carrying 40.For night passengers the standard of comfort aimed at in the Brabazon Typesis generally higher than that in known American aircraft. In this country, wehave had no experience of operating regular sleeper services, and Americanexperience has, as far as we know, been confined chiefly to the Stratoliner, theDC3 and the Clipper. Post-war experience is necessary to prove whether theBritish standard is uneconomically and unnecessarily high, or whether theAmerican standard is not quite high enough. As far as can be ascertained, thestandard of the Brabazon 1, carrying 50 sleepers on the London-New York route,is the highest of all. The passengers are carried in two of four-berth cabinswith ample toilet and dressing accommodation. The cubic allowance perpassenger is about 130&apos; cu. ft., or 177 cu. ft. if promenade, lounge and toiletvolumes are included. Bristols are considering an alternative layout, by whichit is hoped to carry about 80 sleepers on the Trans-Atlantic route. Our informa-tion on the DC7 indicates that its accommodation standard is far below thatConsidered necessary by B.O.A.C., particularly for sleeping passengers who havean allowance of only 83 cu. ft. each. The day passenger allowance is 52 cu. ft.The Constellation carries 22 sleepers with an allowance of 140 cu. ft. each.Appendix 4.Comparison of Aircraft Structure Weights.In the following table, the weights are given of main components of the structure, to compare the efficiencies of transport structure building in Britainand America.

The above Table indicates that American wings, when fuel tank weights are -included, are, on the whole, lighter than British, due it is thought to theAmerican strength factors for wings being lower than the British, and to the moreextended use of integral tanks. Moreover the wings of American aircraft havehad in the past higher aspect ratios than British, but American experience hasshown the increase of weight with aspect ratio not to be necessarily as serious asusually supposed. Whether British designing skill will also bear this out in thefuture remains to be seen. It is to be noted that American practice generallyfollows the use of thick skins for the wings with lighter spars, although it isnot yet established that this leads to lighter wings. Thick skins are, however,more conducive than thin skins to surface smoothness and freedom from waviness;both essential conditions for laminar flow. Considerably more flight experience with civil transport, and also more strength testing, are necessary in this country before our strength factors could be lowered. Military strength factors are atpresent as follows, and it seems likely that civil transports may be built to thesame factors :Britain. A merica.Heavy Bomber    ...       ...       ...       ...      4/4-5 4Flying Boats       ...       .........      3-5/4 4In construction of transport bodies, British design does not appear behindAmerican and on the above showing British bodies are on the whole rather lighterthan American. For flying boats the Shetland body is notably lighter than theMars. Comparison of body weights cannot, however, be pushed very far withoutthe comparison of the cubic capacity, and the purpose for which the aircraft isto be used. British chassis weights are on the whole lighter than American. Inthe case of the Tudors and H.P. 68 this is due largely to the absence of the tricycleundercarriage, but it is also attributable to higher undercarriage strength require-ments called for by the Americans for large aircraft. It cannot, however, be claimed-that this British advantage will continue in the future, when under-carriage requirements in both countries are equalised.Comparison of weights on a percentage basis must be used cautiously untilthe final all-up &quot;weight, at which the aircraft will ultimately fly, is known. It is highly probable that nearly all the aircraft considered will be flown when built at higher all-up weights than those quoted.In America, aircraft structure design is based far more on extensive strengthtesting, and far less on theoretical calculations than is the case in Britain. InAmerica theory is used for the simple primary stress analysis, and the large amount of secondary stressing following this is covered by test. The Americanmethod demands a very large body of tests with comparatively large testing staffswhich need not have an extensive technical training. The answers are, however,likely to lead more quickly to lighter structures, particularly where novelty of construction is involved, than the theoretical -methods. It therefore seems that whilst, so far, American transport structures are not lighter than British, thereliance by the Americans on large-scale testing in place of complicated theory,is likely to be the more profitable in the future.The Fedden Commission reported that American aircraft firms are generallyfar ahead of British firms in assessment and control of weight during design and build-up of the prototype aircraft. Weight analysis sections in America are far more adequately staffed and have a much more authoritative voice than suchweight sections as exist in this country. There is considerable room for improve-ment in weight control in British firms.Appendix 5.Efficiency of British and American Engines for Air TransportPurposes.An exhaustive survey was recently made by Trans-Canada Airways to decide the best power unit to be installed in DC 4&apos;s for operation by T.C.A. on domestic and Trans-Atlantic routes. Pratt and Whitney, Wright, Bristol and Rolls royce engines were considered, with a final choice of the Rolls Royce Merlin RM-14-SM.
The power, specific fuel consumption and weight of the engines are given below.The Centaurus was not considered, but its power and specific consumption areadded for comparison.Engine.

Although the above figures showed the Pratt and Whitney engine to havea lower consumption and a lower weight per B.H.P., the Merlin RM 14 was chosenfor the following reasons :  (a) The high state of development of the complete power unit by Rolls Royce,with the advantages of interchangeability, and the acceptance of complete responsibility for the power unit by Rolls Royce.(b) The superior aerodynamic installation of the Merlin with its smallerfrontal area.(c) The lower weight of the Merlin installation and its lower drag leading to nearly a 1,000-lb. better pay-load on the Trans-Atlantic route.(d) The rated power of the Merlin is higher at altitude above 20,000 ft.,allowing a lower percentage of available power for cruising, to giveequal performance with the Pratt and Whitney.British policy has been to make development of the complete power unit theresponsibility of the engine firm with the great advantage of basicinterchangeability between similar types of aircraft. In America, the power plantsare not interchangeable between different types of aircraft, and in several cases on four-engined aircraft, the inboard and outboard power units have basicdifferences. As a result, the stress design and development work for the power plant installation has to be done for each aircraft, even when the same engine is used. This is a most important consideration for civil transports in which Britishpractice is ahead of American.It is an established fact that for engines of take-off power greater than about800 B.H.P., air-cooled engines have a greater dry weight in lb./B.H.P. thanliquid-cooled engines, and it was shown in Sir Roy Fedden&apos;s Wilbur WrightLecture that there was, on the average.ge, no appreciable difference between the specific dry weights of British and American air-cooled engines. In the presentcomparison we are concerned with the weights of the complete power plant, which to some extent is determined by the actual aircraft. The figures given above forthe power unit in the DC 4 show that the specific power unit weights for theliquid-cooled Rolls Royce engines compares very favourably with thecorresponding figures for the American air-cooled installations. The specificpower unit weight for the British RM-20-SM being the lowest of all.Considering the weight necessary in liquid-cooled engines, for coolers and coolant,this represents a remarkable achievement by Rolls Royce offering great possibilities for British liquid-cooled engines in civil transports.The consumption figures quoted are uneven between the two countries and show no systematic advantage for either. Recent flight tests at Boscombe Downhave given a consumption figure for the Centaurus considerably less than thatquoted above. It is understood that similar flight consumption figures are nowbeing claimed in America for corresponding engines. Such low consumptionsvitally affects the pay-load estimates for long-distance aircraft like the Brabazon 1,and stresses the need for far more instrumentation to allow accurate measurementof consumption figures in flight.[28506]    . rj
There is at present serious lack of a modern British engine with about750-850 B.H.P. at take-off. Lack of such an engine prejudices consideration oftwp power units for the Brabazon 5 A at about 17,000 lb. all-up weight. Thisgap in our range of engines also prejudices design of four-engined aircraft ofabout 35,000 lb. to 40,000 lb. Recently, steps have been taken by M.A.P. to fillthis gap by development of the requisite engine. The smaller number of modernBritish aero engines compared with the American range is likely to be a strongrestriction on freedom of aircraft design in the future. appendix 6.Modern Developments.No evidence can be found that modern American transports incorporate anyfeatures which are not covered in the proposed British transports.(a) Pressurising. The Brabazon Committee has stressed the necessity of- pressurising for passenger comfort over most routes, apart from theNorth Atlantic crossing, where it is essential. As a result, allBrabazon aircraft will be pressurised, except the small Type 5 B. Itshould be noted that the DC 4 is not yet pressurised, nor is the Constel-lation and, in fact, no American civil transports now flying arepressurised. The Douglas Company consider that they will be unableto produce a higher differential pressure than 4 lb./sq. in. for the DC 4,for the next year or so, which is far less than the 5\ lb./sq. in. required.It is considered that, if the programme of pressurising developmentnow initiated in British aircraft is carried on vigorously, this country will be adequately covered for this development.(b)/De-icing. Neither in Britain nor America has thermal de-icing been satisfactorily solved. We have a programme of experimental work,and are maintaining close liaison with America by personal visits onthe development work which is proceeding there. In this country wehave always considered the Goodrich method of rubber-bag inflation and deflation not satisfactory, and have developed liquid de-icing to ahigher state than has been done in America. Liquid de-icing will therefore be incorporated in British Air Transports until a satis-factory thermal system is produced. It is considered, at the moment,much sounder policy to incorporate the liquid de-icing which givesreasonable satisfaction than to attempt incorporating an undevelopedthermal system of de-icing.(c) Tricycle undercarriages and brakes. The advantages of this type ofchassis are fully appreciated in this country, and all Brabazon typeswill be so fitted. The Tudors and HP 68 will have tail wheels, since they are to be produced in the shortest possible time, making use of experience and resources of the Lancaster and Halifax.Wheel brakes on American aircraft are generally more efficientthan British brakes. This is due to the safe application of powerfulbrakes with tricycle undercarriages without nosing over, together withthe usejDf higher pressures in American tyres than in British.(d) Laminar Flow Wings. Low drag-wing sections, combined with smoothsurfaces, are to be incorporated in Brabazon types. This country iswell abreast of modern theoretical research, and has had the N.A.C.A.series of low drag wings made available. This American work hasbeen of very great value to this country. Adequate design data havebeen supplied to the firms. Since it has not yet been definitely established that laminar flow wings do achieve the desired low drag inflight, a certain amount of caution is being exercised in this countryin the degree of laminar flow aimed at. The basic form of construc-tion of American wings using thicker skins is more favourable tosmoothness and freedom from waviness than is British construction;both these features being essential to the achievement of laminar flow.(e) Automatic Controls. At present, operators and certain firms in thiscountry prefer to fit Sperry automatic controls. Reasons for thischoice, instead of the RAE Type, are the greater ease of maintenanceof the Sperry, the greater simplicity of installation in certain aircraft and, above all, the excellent world-wide servicing organisation ^f
Sperrys. Development contracts have been placed by MAP toproduce improved automatic controls suitable for civil transport work,out the present situation is far from satisfactory, and until it isremedied, British civil aircraft will, in many cases, be fitted withSperry automatic controls.(f) Radio Installation. The only suitable radio sets available immediatelyfor installation in the most urgent British civil transports, such as the tudor 1 and 2 and HP. 68, are of American manufacture. TheCommonwealth and Empire Conference on Radio for civil aviationwas held in February 1944, and the recommendations have made quite clear the radio requirements. When military requirements permit,sets will be manufactured in this country, but at present America iswell ahead of Britain in the provision of radio sets for civil aircraft.(g) Contra-rotating and reversible pitch propellers.- Whilst we have in thiscountry no propeller-changing pitch as rapidly as the Hamilton super-Hydromatic we have advanced development on contra-rotatingpropellers which will change pitch at a sufficient rate for all normalflight operation of civil transport aircraft. Furthermore, such pro-pellers, with further development, should be suitable for reversingpitch, after touch-down, to reduce the landing run. Development is proceeding on British types to attain the high rate of change of pitchof the Super-Hydromatic, and this propeller is also to be manufacturedunder licence in this country. Nevertheless, America has been able toput far more effort into advanced propeller designs than we have, andis correspondingly far ahead.
