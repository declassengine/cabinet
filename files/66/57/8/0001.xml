THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 60S.30th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.MEASURES TAKEN BY THE BRITISH COMMONWEALTH TOPROVIDE ASYLUM FOR REFUGEES.Memorandum by the Minister of State.MY colleagues will recall that in Conclusion (3) of the War Cabinet Meeting104 (44) of the 9th August last the Foreign Secretary was invited to arrange forthe preparation by the Departments concerned of a short statement, setting out what we had done to provide accommodation for refugees since the war, as a basis for a communication to the United States Government on this matter.I have consulted my colleagues concerned and the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs has consulted the Dominion Governments, who have authorised the communication to. the United States Government of the relevant figures inrespect of their territories.I accordingly circulate, for approval, the draft of a despatch to Lord Halifaxcovering, as Annex I a statement of the situation in respect of the UnitedKingdom, the Colonial Empire and United Kingdom Mandated Territories. Indiaand Southern Rhodesia and, as Annex II, a tabular statement of the situation inthe Dominions drawn up in a form to meet the wish of the Canadian Governmentthat any overall totals of such figures presented on behalf of the British Common-wealth  IS ct whole should be avoided.I should, perhaps, add that the statements are not in all cases confined to theperiod of the war and that, in respect of the Dominions and of certain other territories, figures are also given of evacuees, internees and prisoners of waraccommodated therein. I think that this is justifiable in that only thus is it possible to give a fair picture of the heavy burden which is at present being borneby these territories.R. L.Foreign Office, 30th October, 1944.Draft Despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Washington.(Confidential.)My Lord, Foreign Office,      October 1944.YOUR Lordship will recall that, in the course of discussion between his Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of theUnited States in August last regarding the so-called &apos;&apos; Horthy offer &apos;&apos; for therelease of Jews from Hungary, His&apos;Majesty&apos;s Government found it necessary toobtain privately from the United States Government an assurance regarding theextent of the commitment which would in fact fall upon them in the event of the hungarian Governments proposals being, as they in fact were, accepted by thetwo Governments.2. This assurance, which was given by the United States Ambassador in aletter dated the 16th August, prior to the issue of the joint declaration made byHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government on the 17th August,was in the following terms : &quot; In entering into the Joint Declaration attached, it is understoodbetween the United States and British Governments that the British capacity to accommodate refugees is limited, so that, while the British Government-12552   [28502] B
has accepted in principle an indefinite commitment, the British Governmentrely on the United States Government to assume its fair share of the burden -and not to face the British Government with a practical impossibility.&quot;*3. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have felt it desirable,in order, should the need arise, to substantiate the difficulties under which theywould labour, as they informed the United States Government in the circumstancesmentioned above, in receiving any further large influx of refugees in the territories in their possession or under their control, to compile on broad lines astatement of the commitments which they have undertaken on this score. I enclose,as Annex I.to this despatch, a statement showing the position as it arises inrespect of (a) The United Kingdom;(b) Colonial and United Kingdom mandated territories;(c) India;(d) Southern Rhodesia.This statement may be regarded as showing the situation existing at the endof September 1944.4. I shall be glad if your Lordship will communicate a copy of this statement to the United States Government. In doing so, I do not consider that it will be either desirable or necessary to link your communication specially with thesituation which arose in August last, as described in paragraphs 1 and 2 above.I should prefer that the statement should simply be communicated to the state department on the basis that it may be of general interest to them to have fortheir information an outline of the commitments of the territories concerned onthis particular score.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have also thoughtit desirable to secure from His Majesty&apos;s Governments in Canada, the Common-wealth of Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa information on similar lines in respect of their territories.6. I enclose, as Annex II to this despatch, a tabular statement containingthis information. Your Lordship should also communicate a copy of this statement to the United States Government, prefacing it by saying that HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom are authorised to say that, inaddition to what has been done in the way of accommodating refugees by theUnited Kingdom and the territories mentioned in Annex I, the followingnumbers have been admitted by Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Unionof South Africa; and that this information is communicated to the United StatesGovernment with the same aim in view as that described in paragraph 4 above.7. Your Lordship will observe that, as. regards the information supplied by His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the Dominions, and also in respect of certain other territories, figures are included of the commitments assumed by the territories in question in respect of other classes of persons, such as evacuees,internees and prisoners of war. It is thought that by so doing a clearer picturecan be presented of the overall burden, in many cases a very heavy one, assumed by these territories.8. While it is not, of course, intended that the statements annexed shouldbe communicated to the Press or otherwise published, your Lordship may findthem useful as background material with which to rebut any serious or sustainedcampaign which may develop on the part of the United States Press or publicopinion to the effect that a fair share of the burden of accommodating and otherwise promoting the welfare of refugees is not being assumed by the BritishCommonwealth. In this connection, and quite apart from the provision of accommodation for refugees in British territory, your Lordship is well aware, asdoubtless are the United States Government, of the continuous interest and activity displayed by His Majesty&apos;s Governments in the task of grappling withthe refugee problem, both through the medium of the Inter-governmental committee on Refugees and by themselves providing transport (in spite of very heavy war-time pressure) and arranging other similar facilities, including the finding of temporary places of refuge.
... ANNEX I.Statement of Accommodation for Refugees Provided by the United: Kingdom, Colonial and United Kingdom Mandated Territories, Indiaand Southern Rhodesia.(a) United Kingdom.At the outbreak of war the number of adult refugees from Germany and austria in this country was approximately 55,000. A large number of these had children and, further, there were more than 13,000 child refugees who hadbeen admitted without their parents. In addition, nearly 10,000 Czechoslovaknationals had found a refuge in this country during the twelve months preceding the war. From 1940 to December 1942 approximately 63,000 aliens who came asrefugees from enemy and enemy-occupied countries have been admitted into theUnited Kingdom. This total includes 20,000 seamen but is exclusive of the verylarge numbers who have come as members of Allied Forces. If all children who came with their parents are allowed for, the total of refugees who were here atthe beginning of the war or who have come here since is approximately 150,000and they are still being admitted.(b) Colonial and United Kingdom Mandated Territories.Cyprus.. Five thousand Greek refugees from Greece and 500 Greek refugees from the dodecanese are at present being maintained in the Colony. Approximately10,000 other refugees, some Greek refugees from the Dodecanese and some jewish refugees from the Balkans have been temporarily accommodated in Cyprus beforepassing on to other destinations.Mauritius.Approximately 1,500 refugees are being maintained and it has been.agreed in principle that a further number may be admitted.Jamaica.Approximately 500 refugees are being maintained. This is additional to1,500 evacuees from Gibraltar.East African Colonies.Additional population, including Italian prisoners of war and Polishrefugees, 90,964, nearly three times the normal white population. Some 17,000Polish refugees have been moved from Persia to East Africa and are distributed between Uganda, Tanganyika, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Camps in kenya and Tanganyika have accommodated 3,000 Greek refugees in transit fromthe Greek mainland via Turkey and Egypt to the Belgian Congo. In addition,Tanganyika has received 500 Greek refugees. 1Palestine. \From the 1st April, 1939, to the 31st March, 1944, 5l\l86 Jewish immigrantshave entered Palestine, the majority of whom were refugees who had beenstranded in neutral countries. The number of Jewish immigrants who enteredPalestine during the seven months ending the 31st July was 9,000 including some,000 Jewish refugees who reached Istanbul from Constanza in small ships andwere sent to Palestine.Refugees received in Palestine other than immigrants &apos; ,Poles (approximately) ... ...       ...     ,...       ... 12,000Greeks    ......      ...      ...      ...      ...... 9,000Refugees from neutral Europe received in 1940(40 per cent. Jews)        ............. 4,000Total...............      25,000[28502] b 2
(c) India.By the end of March 1944 India had provided accommodation and, where necessary, support for approximately 511,000 refugees. Of these, approximately507,000 were British or British-protected persons. The balance covers manynationalities, the largest group of which is composed of Poles from the soviet union. Approximately 3,500 Poles are at present accommodated in India, andthe Government of India have accepted liability for a total of 11,000. It isexpected that the advance of the Allied Armies into Burma will result in a renewed flow of refugees from Burma to India.India&apos;s refugee problem is probably greater than that of any other allied or neutral country, and in the light of the.present food and housing problems and the general economic situation the Government of India feel that despite theutmost goodwill they are not in a position to accept more refugees.(d) Southern Rhodesia.Refugees (11th September, 1944)Evacuees ;British (Far East).........Poles (Middle East)     .........Internees (11th September 1944)Prisoners of War (enemy subGermanItalianBulgarian.
