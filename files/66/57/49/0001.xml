v t.   i   t  ii       this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 649.16^A November, 1944.WAR CABINET.DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF CIVIL AIRCRAFT.Report by the Minister of Labour, Minister of Production, Secretary ofState for Air and Minister of Aircraft Production.AT their meeting on the 1st September, 1944, the War Cabinet stated(W.M. (44) 114th Meeting, Minutes 3 (1) and 3 (2) ) that they attached greatimportance to steps being taken to accelerate.design, development and productionof aircraft for civil use. We were asked to examine the steps needed for suchacceleration, on the basis that some diversion was now justified from the war effort, and to report back to the War Cabinet. We now present the following report.2. Although we were asked to consider the civil programme we have hadto take into account concurrent initial requirements of a five years&apos; programmeof military, naval and civil prototypes. The Secretary of State for Air andthe Minister of Aircraft Production ask that the attention of the War Cabinetbe invited to the existence and scope of this programme. The programme andexplanatory note are annexed.3.   The immediate steps proposed to secure acceleration were (a) supply of additional draughtsmen;(b) high priority for building work in certain drawing offices;(c) designation of labour in experimental shops;(d) placing of production orders.Item (a) is dealt with hereafter; on (b) and (c) the necessary steps have been taken;on (d), which is primarily for the Minister of Aircraft Production, we concurgenerally in production orders being placed without delay, and the programme which he had in mind has been accepted by the Treasury.4. The figure of 500 skilled draughtsmen, which M.A.P. wish to obtain from outside the aircraft industry, consists of 330 for current and pending civil work and 170 to balance up depleted design staffs of other firms. Entries arerequired at 100 per month.5. In support of the demand for the 170 men, the two Ministers draw attention to the five years&apos; provisional programme of prototypes. (Annex.) Theystress that the industry has done little new design work during the war andthat unless there is an intensive design programme this country will soon be seriously and irretrievably behind other Powers in aircraft design. They there-fore regard prosecution of this programme as of the utmost importance if airsupremacy in military and civil types is to be achieved.6. Industry generally has long been acutely short of draughtsmen and theM.A.P. demand presents great difficulty. Against the admitted urgency ofthe civil aircraft demands and the need to maintain supremacy in the aircraftdesign field generally, have to be set claims at least as urgent for military designwork and the reconversion of industry to peace-time work. In our reconversionpolicy even small numbers of draughtsmen are vital to the avoidance of anysubstantial measure of transitional unemployment. Any help from generalindustry must therefore be very limited.[28608] B
7. There is little hope of help from the current and pending programmecuts, which do not release many draughtsmen; this source of supply, however,will not be overlooked. The M.A.P. will also endeavour to reduce the amountof modification work, though little help can be expected from this. A proposal that draughtsmen in other branches of the engineering industry should beinvited to volunteer was agreed to be open to the objections (a) that it wouldconflict with the policy of stimulating preparatory work for reconversion and(6) that it would entail unacceptable publicity. We see no objection, however,to the Ministry of Labour tapping this source unobtrusively, e.g., through theTrade Union concerned, with a view to arranging transfers wherever these are possible without serious damage to reconversion work or important militarydesign work. The Board of Trade and other Departments concerned would be consulted where necessary.8. Certain alternative expedients, which should go some way to meetthe M.A.P. demand are (a) withdrawals from the Forces;(b) further recourse to internal upgrading and training;(c) the possibility of some help from Ministry of Supply establishments;combined with specific examination of individual demands to establish actualneeds and grades required and to ensure demands being in phase withrequirements.9. We propose to watch carefully the progress made in meeting M.A.P.demands. While the Minister of Labour cannot pledge himself to meet requirements in full, he undertakes to give the matter his personal attention.10.   For the present we do not propose amended production forecasts.11.   To summarise (a) Quicker progress on the civil air programme now depends mainly on early. &quot;supply of draughtsmen (paragraph 4).Co) M.A.P. have an important 5-year prototype programme of civil andmilitary types requiring draughtsmen urgently (paragraph 5).(c) To meet the demand from general industry would seriously prejudicereconversion plans (paragraph 6).(d) Having regard to the general shortage of draughtsmen and the essential requirements of reconversion, there is no single or simple method whichwill meet the requirements of M.A.P. with certainty (paragraphs 6,7 and 8).12. We accordingly invite the War Cabinet to agree that, in order to meetthe requirements of M.A.P. for draughtsmen to the fullest practicable extent: (fi) The Ministry of Labour should, without publicity, endeavour to obtainvolunteers from other branches of the engineering industry, with due regard to the claims of reconversion and other important work.(b) The Minister of Labour should examine with the Service Ministers thepossibility of releasing further draughtsmen from the Forces.(c) The Ministry of Aircraft Production should continue to press forward with internal transfers, upgrading and training in the aircraft industry, and should examine with the Ministry of Labour thepossibility of expanding that Departments schemes for trainingdraughtsmen.id) The Ministry of Supply should examine as a matter of urgency thepossibility of transferring draughtsmen from their establishments.E.

.   ANNEX. .   .-Memorandum on our Present Position in Relation to Aircraft Design.Note by Ministry of Aircraft Production.WE have to face the fact that aeronautical design and development are onthe brink of revolutionary changes. This is brought about by the invention ofsuch things as the gas turbine (with and without propellers), tailless forms of aircraft, very low drag wings and surfaces, aerodynamic forms for speeds of600 m.p.h. and over, and now high quality light alloys which, together with bettermethods of structural strength analysis, make possible more economical forms ofstructure.2. This means that the large majority of our present-day concepts of aircraft will become completely obsolete over the next few years. We must,therefore, now adopt the policy of intensive and progressive development of new types of aircraft for R.A.F., Naval and civil purposes.3. When we started the war we had a number of classic designs in handwith great development potentialities before them. Our efforts in research anddevelopment have been largely limited to squeezing the most out of these goodthings, a policy dictated, not only by the trend of the war, but also by shortage of technical and design staff in the Aircraft Industry.4. Very few completely new designs have been evolved during the war.We started the war with no more than 1,900 draughtsmen; even now We have only about 3,000.5. As in 1930 when the monoplane, variable pitch propeller and retractableundercarriage started a new era of aircraft construction, so again we must now make big advances in the light of the new knowledge available. Failure to take this course would mean complete obsolescence, both civil and military, in a matterof a few years, and the complete loss of air superiority.6. In view of the vital importance of the air arm to our future defence andof the consequent need to keep ahead in quality, it is imperative that we do notskimp ourselves in the matter of aircraft design at this critical period.7. Owing to the novelty of the designs which must be undertaken, civil aircraft cannot make full advance until military types have proved the newconceptions in the air. Commercial operators would not be justified in countingon reliable and safe flight with new types featuring tailless aircraft, new formsof turbine propulsion or new forms of wings, until they have been proven in flight.Thus, the first big advances must be made as military types, the future civil typesadopting novel features as quickly as possible after sufficient experience has been gained on the military types. It will therefore be seen that civil and militaryaerodynamic design are complementary.8.   To ensure our future position in the air necessitates two things.(a) our making good our leeway with other countries;(b) a bold programme of new and advanced types.To achieve this we must now build up the design side of the aircraft industry.We must build plenty of prototypes, and build them more quickly. The essentialfactor in the position of potential inferiority in which we find ourselves is toincrease the number of trained engineering draughtsmen in the aircraft industry at once. It must be recognised that any new personnel put on to aircraft designwork require a minimum of six months to accustom themselves to aircrafttechnique. A new design will take at least 1\ years to mature and for very largetypes this time may be extended to four or five years. The need is therefore animmediate one if we are to be able to produce types of aircraft, both civil andmilitary, that we must have a few years hence.9. Although steps have been taken to increase apprentice training toprovide more drawing office staff for the future, the results of this will not become effective for some four years. To meet the immediate problem of designing the brabazon types and, at the same time, commencing some of the necessary noveldesign work, we must augment the present resources by 500 trained engineeringdraughtsmen as quickly as possible. Even with this additional force we shall be far behind the United States in design effort, but we believe that even so, we can keep up to and even ahead of them.10. In the appendix we set out a provisional list of the main types of aircraft that are now required to be designed for the Royal Air Force, the naval air Arm and Civil Aviation.[28608]
APPENDIX.five Years&apos; Programme for Prototype Aircraft.With a view to planning work on new types of aircraft so that we canallocate it to the firms best suited to undertake the various classes of aircraft,a programme has been discussed between representatives of Admiralty, AirMinistry and Ministry of Aircraft Production, which includes Brabazon types and replacements. This programme is designed to foresee as many new types aspossible to follow on those already in hand and should be sufficient to provide acontinuity of essential development work to those firms which we shall requireto constitute the established Aircraft Industry after the war with Germanycomes to an end.It will be seen that we must increase considerably our development effortafter the war if we are to maintain our technical superiority. In most cases weshall require at least two designs for each type, and each firm will have to build a minimum of three aircraft in order that they may be properly tested and proven.Fighter Class.I. * An Interceptor Fighter Type. This will probably be a jet type, onedesign for which has been finalised with Glosters to follow after the Meteor.2. * A Low-Medium General Purpose Fighter Type. To follow after the hawker 2/43 and Spitfire 21 and Spiteful, aiming at the best range possible and adaptability for carrying bombs, P.P., &amp;c.3. * A- Long Range High Performance Fighter Type. Possibly a dualpower type (reciprocating cum jet) or jet with propellers, or reciprocating,according to the prospects of achieving the best range coupled with performance.This type will follow on the 12/43 (Hornet).4. * A&apos; High Speed Fighter jBomber Type. An outline design for this typehas been schemed as a plain jet type. It is possible that such a type may beconvertible to a night fighter, or escort fighter in due course.5. * A Cruiser-Fighter Type. A new conception designed for the protectionof bomber formations. The essential features would be an all-round field of fireby heavy long-range armament, coupled with adequate air range equivalent tothe heavy bomber.6. * An Anti-Ship Attack Type. Possibly derived from 3 or 4.7. * Tactical Reconnaissance. An adaptation of 2.8. * Strategical Reconnaissance (P.R.U.) An adaptation of 2, 3 or 4,9. * Naval Fighter Type.   Adaptations of 1, 2 and/or 3.Bomber Class.10. * Heavy Bomber. As an interim step adapt the Bristol heavy, transport.This, however, is unlikely to provide the full conception of the future heavy bomber, and a new one must be evolved as soon as the relationship of range,armament and bomb load suitable for operational use five to ten years aheadcan be decided.II. * A Robot Bomber. A pilotless ground or air-controlled type to workup the possibilities of this newer form of attack.12. ** Naval Strike Type.[a) 2-3 place torpedo dive-bomber.(b) Single seat high performance fighter/ strike type.13. * A High Speed Night Bomber.14. * A Very High Altitude Bomber.Boat Class.15. * A Jet Fighter Type. A design is now being finalised for this type bySaunders Roe.16. * A Very Large Boat. Based on the data we get from the Shetland, -there is much to be said for building the largest boat possible.  By this means we might advance structural design to sizes greater than the largest land plane now
contemplated, and once again establish practically the relative advantages of theland plane and the boat for the future. There is also a case on the ground ofBritish prestige. -17. * A Sunderland Replacement. A medium-sized .boat may be required,either as a replacement for the Sunderland, or as a type for opening up, and operating from bases which are inaccessible to aircraft other than those operatedfrom the water. This is not a firmly established requirement, but should beincluded for the purpose of planning. - -Long Range Reconnaissance Class.18. * A land plane designed essentially for the maximum possible range.This will be a new type and not a conversion of an aircraft designed for other purposes. .Naval Reconnaissance Class.19. &apos;** (a) A high speed twin-engined reconnaissance type, possibly adapted for some bomb or torpedo load in development.(b) An amphibian.Transport Class.20. A long-range York-replacement will be needed, possibly derived fromthe large-sized Tudor or from the new Brabazon Type 3A or 3B.21. * A short-range high capacity cargo plane is envisaged which will beeconomical to build and operate. A new conception is required in this category.Any other transports derived, if possible, from Brabazon types.Trainer Class.22. ** Assuming that the ab initi^p trainer remains the simple somewhatprimitive type now contemplated, an &quot;immediate trainer to replace the Masterwill be needed. The question here is whether ab initio trainer should be designed as a type somewhat nearer to the single-seat fighter, or whether it remains as at present and an interim trainer be provided. In either event anew type is required.23. * A twin-engine interim trainer will have to replace the Oxford andAnson. This type will have to serve also as a gunnery and navigation trainerby adaptation.24. *A type for operational crew training is possibly required. Whetherthis should be a twin- or four-engined type, or whether, in fact, the obsoleteheavy bomber type could not be used for this role requires further consideration.Communication Class.25. * A small slow landing type and a small capacity twin-engine typeshould fill the needs of this class. No doubt they can be provided from civiltypes which will be designed for private and feeder line operation.Glider Class.26. * The future, of the glider is not at present clear. Replacements arelikely to take the form of gliders very similar to existing types; alternatively,if they become powered, this class may merge into 20 above. If gliders as suchare to go on progressively, then the tug will become the predominating featureand a specially designed aircraft to provide the essential characteristics will berequired, as it appears unlikely that aircraft converted from other roles willcontinue to be capable of this work.Helicopter Class.27. * The roles for which helicopters are best suited have yet to beestablished and they will only be so through the building of a number ofdevelopment types. The Navy will need to be provided with at least one typeand the R.A.F. will certainly require to evolve at least two, one of which beingsuitable for Army Co-operation purposes. There is, therefore, an opening forthree types of helicopter.
Civil Types.  &apos;We have already set to work on the Brabazon types.28. * Brabazon 1 is under design and, being a long-term venture, there isno need, at this stage, to look further in this class of very long-range transport.In the meantime, we have the long-range Tudor I in hand.29. * Brabazon 2 is also under design and again is sufficiently far off flightto require no replacement planning immediately.30. *Brabazon 3. A new design in this class, has now been placed withA. V. Roe. In the meantime we have the Tudor II of shorter range and greatercarrying capacity than the Tudor I.31. * Brabazon 4. It is hoped that De Havillands will be able to start the design of a jet-driven aircraft early next year.32.   * Brabazon 5A. The design for this class has been placed.33. * Brabazon &amp;B. The design for this type has been placed. This classwill probably fill one of the roles in 25.34. * Rapid development, particularly in the turbine field, may make itnecessary to allow for replacement of some of the Brabazon types within a relatively short period. There is also need for intermediate types in the brabazon list, e.g., between Type 1 and Type 3 and for additional types in thePrivate, Charter, Helicopter, Freighter and Flying-boat classes. Further con-sideration is being given to these requirements by the Brabazon Committee.There will certainly be competition to produce a hack private owner&apos;s type,for which a number of the smaller firms will, no doubt, compete. This typemay provide for 25.   So far no designs are in hand.Allowing for, say, eight additional civil types, but disregarding pureresearch aircraft, of which there will certainly be, say, four types, it seemsevident that there is plenty of work for the aircraft industry ahead of it. this programme gives us forty-four types (excluding Brabazon replacements) whichmust be provided for, and in many cases it will be desirable to order two, andin some cases even three, of each type. A round figure of seventy designs indicatesthe task before us.There is no doubt that an aircrcaft programme of this size will stimulate the industry and enable the future of the industry to be more accurately fore-cast. At the same time it will act as a strong impetus upon the recently issuednew engine programme. It is clear, however, that the resources of both aircraft and engine design staff will have to be augmented if we are to retain our leadin the air.
