naval SITUATION.General Review.-.: I   1.   A convoy of two ships has arrived in North Russia. ................H,M. submarines have inflicted losses on enemy shipping in the East indies and in the Java Sea. -    .Many mines have been swept in the Scheldt and its approaches. Mme-sweepers have arrived at Antwerp.Northern Ykr aters.2. A convoy of two ships from the United Kingdom which were conveyingrecaptured Russians back to their country arrived safely on the 6th in north russia.3. H.M.S. Mounsey (frigate) while patrolling off Kola Inlet on the 1st was torpedoed by a U-boat but reached port under her own power. There were11 casualties, including ten killed.Home and Norwegian Waters.4. On the 1st two Norwegian M.T.B.S engaged and sank two patrol vessels in the northern approach to Sogne Fjord (north of Bergen).5. On the night of the lst/2nd off the Hook of Holland M.T.B.S torpedoeda heavily escorted cargo ship o.f 3,000 tons and damaged several of the escortsby gunfire : one M.T.B. was damaged.- Later, two other M.T.B.S engaged a forceof trawlers, tank landing craft and E-boats, of which one trawler was torpedoed and sunk : an M.T.B. sustained damage. Off Ijmuiden on the same night M.T.B.Sfought an inconclusive action with minesweepers.6. In the initial operations against Walcheren, casualties in major landing craft amounted to nine sunk and eight damaged out of a total, of 25. Among the minor landing craft eight were lost and four were damaged.7. On the 2nd minesweepers, while sweeping off the mouth of the Scheldt,were heavily shelled by a shore battery north of Heyst. Two of the ships were damaged : there were three casualties. By the 6th, after intensive sweeping of the scheldt approaches, it was reported that shallow draught vessels could proceed toFlushing.A German hospital carrier with an armed crew has been intercepted between north and South Beveland and a guard placed on board.8. At Zeebrugge the mole has been badly damaged, the lock to the BrugesCanal is partly obstructed and the terminal of the train-ferry blocked by sunkenships.   The basin east of the canal entrance can accommodate five L.S.T.9. At Ostend a further nine berths of 200 feet length are now available inthe harbour. On the 5th a convoy of tank landing craft sailing to the UnitedKingdom from Ostend ran into heavy weather. One L.C.T. is known to have sunk and five others have either been abandoned or are seriously damaged.10. It is now known that the danlayer and the small tanker which were reported in last week&apos;s Resume to have been sunk or damaged by underwaterexplosions on the 2nd were both sunk in an attack by seven human torpedoes on shipping at Ostend.11. At Rouen the 12,000-ton blockship Ole Wegger was raised on the 7th andtowed clear.  The length restriction on ships entering the port has now been lifted.12. During the week ending the 7th combined British and U.S. dischargesthrough the liberated ports of France and Belgium were approximately 60,000men, 9,500 vehicles, 347,000 tons of supplies and 103,000 tons of petrol.Mediterranean.Gulf of Genoa.13. Enemy barracks, gun emplacements and M.T. were shelled by the U.S.S.Woolsey (destroyer) on the 3rd and again on the following day in company withthe US.S. Benson and the French Forbin (destroyers).
Adriatic.14. On the night of the lst/2nd H.M. ships Wheatland and A vonvale(destroyers) sank three torpedo-boats, one of which was the Italian Audace(formerly the Japanese Kwakaze) off Pag Island on the Dalmatian coast. Threeofficers and 68 ratings were taken prisoner.   H.M.S. A vonvale sustained slightThe German hospital carrier Bonn was intercepted on the 4th by H.M.S.A Idenham (destroyer) and escorted into Ancona for examination.The whole of the Dalmatian coast from Zara to Risan was reported on the6th to be clear of the enemy.JEgean and Dodecanese.15. On the 1st H.M.S. Black Prince (cruiser) and aircraft from H.M.S.Emperor (escort carrier) supported land operations on Milo. On the 5th thenaval landing party and troops were evacuated : see Military Situation.H.M.S. Kimberley (destroyer) sank an F-lighter and an M.L. on the 4thoff Piskopi.East Indies.16. H.M. S/M Subtle on patrol off Sabang probably sank a minesweeperon the 11th and, five days later, sank at least one of a convoy of five small coasters.H.M. S/M Stygian in the Strait of Malacca between the 17th and the 21stsank two coasters and a barge and sank or damaged three junks. Stygian also attacked a convoy of 12 ships, sinking an 800-ton coaster and a landing-craft and damaging other&quot; vessels.Pacific.17. H.M. S/M Tantivy, on patrol in the eastern Java Sea, between the 21stand 26th, sank 14 schooners, four coasters and an anti-submarine vessel. Tantivyalso damaged two schooners and a 1,800-ton coaster which she drove ashore. Allthe ships attacked were heavily laden.Anti-Submarine Operations.18. Fifteen attacks on U-boats were reported during the week, of whicheleven were by ships and four by aircraft. None of these attacks is considered tohave been promising.Enemy Intelligence.Germany.19. Further reports on the damage inflicted on the Tirpitz in the attack by Lancasters of Bomber Command on the 29th suggest that it will probablybe necessary to&apos;rebuild the ship forward of &quot; A &quot; turret. To make the shipfully operational a period of four to six months in a dockyard would probably benecessary.20. The Battle Units Command which includes the explosive motor-boats,midget submarines and human torpedoes is stated to be in process of expansion.Flotillas of human torpedoes are reported to be based in Northern denmark and some may also have been sent to Southern Norway.Japan.21. On the 1st June Japan possessed 18 aircraft carriers of all types. As aresult of the battle of the marinas and the recent Philippines actions, there arenow thought to be ten effective carriers of which two are regular carriers(80 aircraft each), two converted carriers (54 and 36), two battleship carriers(24 each) and four escort carriers (36 each). One fleet carrier is building andis likely to be in service within the next three months.Of nine battleships, one 14&quot; ship was sunk on the 25th October and another was probably sunk. All the remainder were damaged to some extent in the philippines but as far as is known six remain effective. (Two of these are theships mentioned above as &quot;battleship carriers.&quot;) Three 16&quot; Yamato classships, are building and are now overdue for completion, though it is possiblethat one of them has been converted and completed as the fleet carrier Unryu.[28567] B
U-boats.22. One U-boat is believed to be patrolling in the Channel, another may besouth-west of Ireland (R) making for the Channel and there is probably at least one on patrol north of Ireland (R). One is thought to be operating west of theStrait of Gibraltar. In the Indian Ocean no German U-boats are at present estimated to be on patrol but there may be two Japanese U-boats in the bay of Bengal.23. Reconnaissance of the new constructional or operational U-boat base at Fai-ge, near Vegesack, on the 25th showed very considerable advances in building.  The first stage of roofing is likely to be completed in about four weeks.Enemy Attack on Shipping.24. Three ships are reported to have been attacked by U-boats during theweek. One ship was torpedoed in the St. Lawrence River and another was sunkin the Bay of Bengal, north of Trincomalee. A U.S. tanker on passage fromAbadan to Brisbane was torpedoed in the South Indian Ocean. A small tankerwas damaged by an underwater explosion off the Normandy coast and was beached.25. Shipping losses by enemy action during October amounted to 11,668 tons.With the addition of marine casualties the total of losses from all causes amountedto 27,608 tons, which is the lowest monthly figure of the war. The only ship lost by U-boat was sunk in the Pacific, probably by a Japanese U-boat. Three other ships were sunk by mines : two off the northern French coast and one in, Greekwaters. In addition two ships were damaged by mines in the Mediterranean, butreached&apos; port.Protection of Seaborne Trade.26. During October, 18 convoys of 691 ships arrived in the United kingdom without loss by enemy action and one convoy from North Russia, originally of30 ships, lost two in September before arrival. In addition six ships proceededdirect to France and 124 of the 691 did not discharge their cargoes in the UnitedKingdom. Twenty-three outward-bound convoys, of 711 ships, arrived at their destination without loss, including one convoy of 29 ships to North Russia. Thetotal number of ships convoyed in October (including coastal but excludingoperational convoys) was 4,441 in 336 convoys, two ships, as above, being lost.Allied Minelaying.27. Mines were laid by surface craft in Home Waters and by -aircraft inthe Heligoland Bight.Aircraft also laid mines off Bangkok.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.28. There have been no reports of minelaying by enemy aircraft in home waters, but minelaying by E-boats took place on one night in the approaches to the scheldt.   Fourteen mines have been destroyed in the Scheldt approach channel.In the Scheldt a strong force of minesweepers had reached Terneuzen by the4th. Some sweepers have arrived at Antwerp. Sweeping was suspended owingto unfavourable weather on the 7th, but 18 moored mines and 102 ground had been destroyed by that date.Channels from Calais to Boulogne and from Dieppe to Havre have beenestablished, in addition to an approach channel at Brest and a coastal channel offthe north Brittany coast.Since the beginning of the operations in Normandy a total of 1,690 mines have been destroyed in Home Waters and the North Sea.29. In the Mediterranean 22 mines have been destroyed during the week inGreek waters and off the Dalmatian coast. Sweeping in the approaches to salonika has been facilitated by the discovery of a German plot of the minefield.The mine totals are 5,910 ground and 6,553 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.30. It is estimated that during the first nine months of this year the limited forces engaged in anti-shipping operations in Northern Waters deprivedthe enemy of at least six and a quarter million tons of overseas trade.   The
tonnage sunk by sea-mining and by naval and air attacks is considered to havebeen three times as much as has been replaced by the Hansa building programme,31. Information has come to hand on the effects of the mining of the danube. On the middle reaches between Bratislava and the Iron Gates, at least200 barges and 60/70 tugs are reported to have been mined. Commercial traffic on the Danube had virtually ceased by the beginning of July.32. A further eight German, or German-controlled, ships are known to havebeen sunk or damaged by British mining in the Baltic, the North Sea and offthe Norwegian coast.   Of these,, five ships totalling about 15,700 tons were sunk.MILITARY SITUATION.Western Europe.    (An outline map is enclosed as an inset.)General.33. During the past week U.S. and French forces have gained valuableground at various points between the Mediterranean and Aix-la-Chapelle; butthe outstanding achievements have been those of the Second British and FirstCanadian Armies.Our troops are closing in upon Meijel, west of Venlo; they have cleared thesouthern bank of the River Maas, except for a small and ineffective enemy pocketat Moerdijk; fighting in the most difficult conditions, they have eliminated mostof the enemy garrison of Walcheren; arid on the 3rd they cleared the last enemy resistance south of the Scheldt. The most important gain from these achieve-ments is the liberation of Antwerp as a .port, while the operations to the Maashave removed a potential threat to the western flank of the Nijmegen salient.Southern Group of Armies.34. On the Mediterranean Coast a U.S. force moved forward on the 1st to capture Sostello and two other villages in the area 15 miles N.E. of Nice. since then enemy resistance has stiffened considerably and progress has been slow, but some important features on the Franco-Italian frontier have been cleared.In the hilly and heavily wooded country east of the Moselotte French troops have been making small but steady advances.The town of St. Die remains in enemy hands, but during the week, U.S.troops have widened their salient west of that town. Further north French andU.S. forces have made valuable gains in their move up the valley of the Meurthe.The enemy are resisting strongly here, and are making full use of minefields to hamper our advance.&apos; French troops occupied Baccarat, on the Luneville-St. Die road on the 1st,and have since advanced four miles to the east. In the pocket N.W. of St. Dieformed by our forces advancing from the north and the south, the enemy arebeing slowly pushed back to the Meurthe.Central Group of Armies.35. There has. been no substantial change in this sector during the week.N.E. of Nancy, U.S. forces made limited advances and west of Metz have beenregrouping. On the morning of the 8th they took the offensive between Metz andNancy and the latest reports indicate a limited advance over a wide front.In the country west of Schmidt, a small town 17 miles S.E. of Aix-la-Chapelle,U.S. forces have been engaged in heavy fighting. Enemy resistance here is basedupon a series of pillboxes, and little progress has been made; enemy counter-attacks have been held.&apos;Northern Group of Armies.36. West of Venlo our troops have been fighting back towards Meijel, whichthe enemy had recaptured on the 27th October. By the 5th, our troops werewithin a mile of the town. The enemy resisted strongly and our advance is beinghampered by mines and by the boggy nature of the country.N.W. of Hertogenbosch Allied troops by the 5th had cleared the south bank ofthe Maas as far west as Gertruidenburg.
Further west, the line of the Mark River and the Dintel Mark Canal was theprincipal obstacle in the way of the Allied drive to the River Maas. On the night of the 2nd/3rd British, U.S. and Polish troops secured bridgeheads overthe obstacle on a wide front. The enemy everywhere counter-attacked strongly,but after fierce fighting Allied troops held their ground.Once the bridgeheads across the Mark water obstacles hdd been established,Allied troops were able to strike straight forward to the line of the River Maas.The enemy demolished the Moerdijk bridge on the 5th and on the 7th our troopscaptured Willemstad.&quot; The small enemy garrison at Moerdijk is being constantlyharassed and should shortly be eliminated.On the island of Walcheren our troops have been fighting along narrowdefiles bounded by flood water, often in the water &quot;itself. The bitter struggle forthe causeway leading to the island was completed by the evening of the 2nd,and by the same time British commandos had occupied Domburg and most ofFlushing. On the 3rd, the last of the enemy coastal guns covering the mouth of the Scheldt was captured and the count of enemy prisoners reached 2,000.On the 7th, Middelburg and Veere were captured, and by the next day the only remaining enemy resistance had been limited to the area N.E. ofDomburg.On the 2nd, Canadian troops captured Knocke in the Scheldt pocket andon the following day all resistance south of the Scheldt ceased. Since crossing the Leopold Canal our troops have taken over 14,000 prisoners in this area.Italy.    (An outline map is enclosed as an inset.)37. Very little change has occurred along the Italian front during the past week. This is accounted for less by the weather than by the necessity forregrouping; consequently, Fifth A.rmy&apos;s front shows virtually no change at allsince last week, although Eighth Army, as a result of an attack which went insouth of Highway 9 on the night of the 7th/8th were closing in on Forli.Polish forces have made some gains north of Rocca S. Casciano, and latest information shows them to be within 2^ miles S.W. of Modigliana.The Eastern European Front.   (An outline map is enclosed as an inset.)Finland.38.   The German withdrawal towards the north continues.Northern sector.39. Further Russian attacks against the Germans cut off in north-westLatvia have met stubborn resistance and there has again been no changeir. the line.Central sector.40. In East Prussia German counter-attacks have forced the Russians to evacuate Goldap.The Germans claimed on the 2nd that during the previous few weeks theyhad frustrated a large-scale Russian offensive in the Narev Sector, aimed at east prussia. This claim doubtless contained a grain of truth, in so far as theRussians had, in fact, been attacking in that area, but, as on many previous occasions, the Germans have apparently exaggerated the scale of the fighting in order to claim an impressive defensive success.Southern sector.41. The Russians have approached closer to Budapest on the south-east andwere at one time reported to have reached the outskirts of the city. The Germansclaim that counter-attacks against the Russian flank have eased the situation.Greece.42.   The mainland of Greece is now-entirely free of the enemy.Our forces on Milo were reinforced on the 30th October by a small navalparty. Enemy resistance stiffened, however, and our troops were withdrawnon the 5th having suffered two casualties against enemy casualties of about one hundred.
Yugoslavia. *       -43. The Germans have increased their efforts towards re-opening escaperoutes into Serbia and their columns have pushed westwards from Cacak and north-westwards from Sjenica towards Sarajevo.In the coastal area, the Partisans have captured the ports of Zara and Sibenikand are now surrounding the German garrison on Knin.Burma.44. Kennedy Peak fell to Indian troops on the 5th. Much enemy ammuni-tion, equipment and rations were taken with the position. Other Indian troops have established a road block four miles south of Kennedy Peak, through whichremnants of the Japanese defenders unsuccessfully attempted to escape. Anoutflanking movement by our troops has now reached a position two and a halfmiles south-south-east of -Fort White, while our troops advancing from thewest are within one and a half miles of the village.In the Kabaw Valley Allied troops are within eight miles of Kalemyo.They have constructed an air strip thirteen miles south of Yazagyo.On the 2nd November British troops advancing down the Myitkyina-Man-dalay railway, took Mawlu eighteen miles north of Indaw, the scene of actions by troops of the 3rd Indian Division earlier in the year. Chinese troops have advanced north-east and west of Bhamo. Thirty-five miles west of Bhamothey have reached the Irrawaddy River and established two bridgeheads on thesouth bank without opposition. Other Chinese troops are now ten miles north-east of Bhamo.China.45. Japanese forces have reached Kweilin, but resistance is still being offered inside the city, and fighting continues.To the south of Kweilin the last remaining road running east to Jukonghas been cut by the Japanese.In the Wesl River region the Japanese are reported to have capturedMosun, some thirty miles from the Liuchow-Nanning highway.Philippines.46. On the 29th October, and again on 1st November, Japanese troops inthe northern area of Leyte counter-attacked the U.S. troops and forced them togive up the town of Carigara. On the 2nd, however, U.S. forces reoccupiedCarigara and have since driven some five miles further along the coast. OtherTJ.S. troops reached the west coast of Leyte at Baybay, and subsequentlypatrolled fourteen&apos; miles north and four miles south along the coast withoutmeeting opposition. The Japanese defenders of Leyte have withdrawn into thenorth-western end of the island, where they have been reinforced. A fierce battleis now raging north of Ormoc. Enemy casualties on Leyte are estimated at12,554 killed and 109 prisoners of war.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.47. Flying-bombs continued to be launched against this country. fighter command flew 239 sorties against these attacks, and destroyed two He. 111.Home Waters.48.   Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 789 sorties.Attacks were made on shipping off the Norwegian Coast, and on the 4thstrikes were obtained on several vessels of 1,500/2,500 tons. Two of these were left burning, two probably sunk and at least one other was damaged.On the 8th, Beaufighters and Mosquitoes operated effectively against two3,000-ton merchant vessels and three coasters of the S.W. coast of-Norway. R.P.hits were observed on both merchant vessels which were left emitting. smoke.The three coasters were also hit and one was left on fire,Bomber Command laid 69 sea-mines.
* Western Europe.49. In the week ended dawn on the 8th November, aircraft of the S.H.A.E.F.(Air) flew 8,860 sorties and dropped 2,094 tons of bombs. In the week endeddawn&apos; on the 9th November, Bomber Command and the U.S. VIII Bomber-Command flew 9,889 sorties and dropped 23,483 tons, while Fighter command and the U.S. VIII Fighter Command flew 5,574 sorties. Two hundred andtwenty enemy aircraft were destroyed and 77 damaged; 266 Allied aircraft are missing (12 of these are believed to have landed in France).Although the weather to some extent interfered with operations, heavy attacks were - continued against enemy industrial and supply targets and oncommunications.   Pathfinder technique was frequently employed.During daylight attacks on the 2nd against four synthetic oil plants atHomberg (Meerbeck), Merseburg (20 miles W. of Leipsig), Sterkrade (Holten),and Castrop-Rauxel (Ruhr), when a total of 2,746 tons was dropped with good results, there was considerable opposition by some 300/400 enemy aircraft. Ofthese, the bombers destroyed 36, and escorting fighters 132 in the air and 25 onthe ground. In addition, 40 more were probably destroyed and 52 damaged.The oil plants at Homberg and Merseburg were again bombed through cloudon the 8th (731 and 426 tons respectively).On the night 2nd/3rd, heavies released 4,473 tons on Dusseldorf in clear weather. Bombing is reported to have been well concentrated, and a seriesof explosions (of which one was particularly impressive) and large columns ofsmoke were observed. The target area was described as a mass of flames. Againenemy fighter activity was considerable and the bombers destroyed seven,including five jet-propelled aircraft. On the homeward journey fires were stillvisible as far away as Charleroi in Belgium.Similar reports were made after 3,323 tons had been released over Bochumon the night 4th/5th.   Several heavy explosions were caused and smoke, fromfires visible 100 miles away on the return journey,  reached a height of10,000 feet.    Of 19 enemy fighters destroyed, 18 were of the jet-propelled&quot;type.On the night 6th/7th, Lancasters dropped 513 tons on Coblenz in clearweather. This was the first major attack ,of the war on this city. Late in the attack crews reported that the whole town seemed to be ablaze and largeexplosions were observed. Solingen was attacked on two occasions (1,837 tons)mostly through cloud, although smoke and a number of bursts which were seenindicated satisfactory results.Further synthetic oil plants were bombed during the week, includingHamburg (two attacks 781 tons), Hamburg (Harburg, two attacks 966 tons),Hanover (Misburg 528 tons), Neunkirchen (381 tons), Gelsenkirchen(Nordstern 328 tons), Bottrop (two attacks 373 tons), Sterkrade (388 tons),Duisburg (121 tons) and Ludwigshaven (453 tons). In these operations Pathfindertechnique was employed.A number of heavy attacks was made on railway centres. On the 5th and6th Fortresses and Liberators dropped a total of 3,326 tons on this type of targetat Frankfurt, Karlsruhe, Ludwigshaven, Hanau, Kaiserslautern, Neumunster,Rheydt and Hamm. Cloud prevented the observation of results. Again on the6th, 2,626 tons were released on Gelsenkirchen in weather which, although clear in the early stages of the attack, deteriorated later. Heavy smoke was seen,however, in the railway yards. The ground defences were reported on this occasion as formidable. On the 8th, Liberators attacked Rheine railway centre(N.W. of Munster 140 tons), once more through cloud.On the 2nd the railway viaduct at Bielefeld was effectively bombed (348 tons).On the night 4th/5th, an excellent concentration of bombing was obtained in an operation against the Dortmund-Ems Canal (926 tons). The main (western)area of the canal was breached at the same point as on the 23rd September, 1944(where repairs had been effected), but this time the breach was wider. Waterrapidly emptied into the River Glane, and several barges were seen to be stranded.On the 6th, the Mittelland Canal was bombed near Minden, and on the 8theight Liberators dropped 18 tons on another canal at Nordhorn (20 miles NW.of Rheine); both attacks were made through cloud.Small-scale attacks were made on other targets, including Berlin, Herford(70 miles S. of.Bremen) and Stuttgart. Two hundred and thirty tons of bombs were dropped by medium bombers on an ammunition dump and a supply andordnance depot at Hambourg (near Metz).* The results of some of these attacks are given in Appendix VII.
Roads, railways and&apos; bridges in Holland and Western Germany formedtargets for medium and fighter-bombers and fighters. A number of trains was hit,as were enemy gun-positions and many M.T.In the battle area many attacks were made on enemy movements and a variety of other targets, including bridges. Heavy support was given to land forces,notably on Walcheren Island and in the Maas Estuary. Railway lines were cut in over 200 places and many buildings demolished. Some 150 locomotives, 520railway wagons, 160 M.rI* and 90 barges were destroyed or damaged.A total of 2,336 sorties was flown by aircraft carrying supplies to theContinent.Offensive activity by the G.A.F. during the week was on a very small scale.Southern Europe.50.   The weather improved towards the middle of the week under review.During the week ended the 7th, aircraft of the M.A.A.F. flew a total of11,393 sorties (3,084 by heavy bombers); 7,375 tons of bombs were dropped. Atotal of 57 Allied-aircraft (including 20 heavies) is missing and 26 enemy aircraft were destroyed.The main effort of the strategic bombers was directed against oil refineriesand railway centres in Austria, and against troop concentrations and communica-tion targets on the enemy escape routes through Yugoslavia. The main supplyroutes through the Brenner Pass also received attention.Medium bombers of Middle East Command attacked coastal batteries on Milo.Enemy air activity was on a negligible scale; some 45/65 enemy fighters (atotal of 13 destroyed) were, however, encountered in the Lake Balaton area on two occasions.Italy.51. The offensive against the supply routes through the Brenner Pass was-opened on the 4th by a very successful attack by Marauders on A.A. gun positions; this was succeeded by 325 medium bombers attacking on the following day without loss, when the railway line was blocked, many rails cut and severalbridges destroyed. A similar sized force of mediums again attacked on the 6th,when further destruction was caused, while 22 heavies obtained good results in anattack on the electric railway power station at Bolzano. On the 7th, this railwaywas again bombed by 77 Liberators, and another force struck at the two bridgesover the Adige (ten miles south of Bolzano and twelve miles north of Trento).Fighter-bombers and fighters continued to operate in strength in close supportof the armies and to attack communications in the rear of the battle area, thelatter attacks being extended to cover Yugoslavia. Approximately 3,000 sorties were flown on these missions and in all over 250 locomotives and some 500 railwaycars were destroyed or damaged. Medium bombers were employed in a similarrole, their two outstanding missions of the week being an attack on road and railway bridges in the Po Valley on the 4th by 135 Mitchells, and another by 300aircraft against troop concentrations in the Forli area on the 7th.Shipping in -the harbour of Fiume was successfully attacked on the 5th, andthe railway centre of that town was the target for a small force of mediums on thefollowing day.Yugoslavia and A albania.52. Troop concentrations were attacked with excellent results by strategicbombers from Italy, when weather permitted; those at Podgorica (62 miles S.E. ofDubrovnik) were the target for over 100 aircraft during the week (39 Lightningsalso made a separate attack), while those at four other centres also receivedattention. The railway centres at Sarajevo were heavily bombed (444 tons) in clear weather, whilst 68 tons and 350 tons were dropped on that at Maribor(182 miles N. of Zara) on the 6th and 7th respectively. Over 400 sorties weremade by Wellingtons and Liberators in dropping supplies and leaflets.Medium bombers also operated with success. On the 4th, Mustangs, without loss, destroyed 40 locomotives, 14 railway cars and 21 M.T., damaged a further21 locomotives and over 100 rail cars and sank three barges. R.P. Beaufightersof the Balkan Air Force scored numerous hits in two attacks on the new palaceand military camp at Tirana.
Far East.Burma, Malaya and Siam.55. Allied aircraft for the week ended dawn on the 6th, flew a total of2,500 sorties (ten aircraft missing), of which 1,326 were by bombers and fighter-bombers. In addition, transport aircraft flew a total of 2,574 sorties, carrying5,870 tons and 4,173 personnel and evacuating 469 men and 772 casualties.The primary feature of the week was the attack carried out by. 44 U.S.Super Fortresses (one missing), based in India, on the Malagon railway centre atRangoon. Aircraft with centre wing tanks carried 40 x 500-lb bombs; a total,of 396 tons was dropped and photographs show that heavy, dan age resulted.Fighter opposition was weak, in which connection it is to be noted that 73 Alliedfighters attacked Mingaladon, Zayatkwin and Hmawbi airfields on the same day.On the following day 16 escorted Liberators successfully bombed the railway workshops at Insein, near Rangoon; three enemy fighters were destroyed and fiveprobably destroyed. On the 5th, 53 Super Fortresses (two missing) attacked thedry dock in Singapore navy yard, each aircraft carrying 5 x 500-lb. bombs; atotal of 71 tons was dropped with success. Fighter opposition was negligible andAA. fire inaccurate.Army support operations continued daily in the Chindwin/Chin Hills area,medium and fighter-bombers attacking positions at Kennedy Peak, Fort White,Kalewa, Kalemyo, Masein and Dolluang, with good results.Fighters operated regularly in the Bhamo/Katha area against enemy posi-tions and communications; the airfield at Kawlin was machine-gunned.In Central Burma, airfields formed the primary objectives, those at Meiktila,Onbauk, Shwebo, and Thedaw being attacked regularly. Thunderbolts scoredhits on the oil installations at Chauk, where the pipe-line was left in flames. Onthe 4th, 23 Mitchells successfully attacked the railway station at Myingyan, whilston the next day a similar force bombed a supply area at Kimu with good results.In the course of all the above operations, good execution was done to M.T., rivercraft and other communications objectives.In Siam, Liberators destroyed the Dara bridge (20 miles S. of TJttaradit),whilst in two attacks by night considerable damage was inflicted on the railway centre and engine sheds at Bangkok.   Sea-mines were also laid in Bangkok river.Enemy activity was on a small scale; a light attack was made on our air-fields at Palel and Tamu, when one aircraft was destroyed on the ground andthree enemy were shot down.The Balkan Air Force flew a total of 661 sorties (five aircraft missing), andwere active against communication targets with good results.The Coastal Air Force attacked small shipping in the Adriatic and the gulf of Genoa; no outstanding results have been reported.Austria and South Germany.53. Amongst the targets for U.S. heavy bombers those in the Vienna areapredominated during the week; 500 aircraft bombed trie Florisdorf oil refinery(980 tons) with unobserved results, whilst that at Moosbierbaum received 360 tons,severe damage being caused. The ordnance depot was the target on two occasions(over 500 tons) and the railway centre and adjacent factories were also attackedtwice.  Photographs show that considerable destruction resulted.The following centres were also attacked : Graz, ordnance depot (100 tons)and railway centre (60 tons); Kapfenburg (25 miles N. of Graz) tank factories and railway (80 tons); Linz railway centre (240 tons) and benzol plant (290 tons).Small tonnages were also dropped on other targets, including the aircraft factory at Klagenfurt.In South Germany on the 4th, the railway centre at Munich West received190 tons; Augsburg (100 tons) and the oil storage plant at Regensburg (430 tons);results were unobserved.-Russia.54. The Russian claim of enemy aircraft destroyed (54) is abnormally low and no operations of importance have been reported. The most active sector onthe Eastern Front so far as the G.A.F. in concerned is that in the region ofBudapest; elsewhere fuel shortage appears to be hampering operations.
China Zone.56. For the six days ended dusk on the 5th, Allied aircraft flew 786 sorties(including 252 transport); one aircraft was lost and two enemy destroyed.In the provinces Hupeh/ Hunan two attacks were made on the airfield atKingmen (90 miles W.N.W. of Hankow), on one occasion 16 enemy aircraft being destroyed in the ground; airfields at Siaokan and Paoching also received atten-tion, whilst bridges at Sinshih and Pengpu were both severely damaged.In Kwangsi province, medium bombers and fighters attacked the towns ofLingchwan, Kongchow and Wuchow; enemy concentrations in the Kweilin area,rivercraft and other similar targets were also attacked.Liberators laid sea-mines in Victoria Harbour (Hong Kong); convoys in theSouth China sea were attacked but results have not been reported.Enemy offensive activity was confined to light attacks on our airfields atLiuchow, Hsian and Chi-kiang; except for severe damage to the communicationsystem at the first named, damage was slight.Pacific.57. Medium and heavy bombers caused considerable damage to airfields inthe Philippines. At Bacolod (Negros Island four attacks) hits were obtained,and four enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground. At Cebu (five attacks) 80 tonsof bombs were dropped, 14 aircraft destroyed on the ground and two in combat,,a number of buildings demolished and hits obtained on the runway. At Alicanteairfield (N.W. Negros Island three attacks), Liberators reported excellent results, while Mitchells destroyed four and damaged as many enemy aircraftamong 25 which intercepted; this for the loss of one bomber.It is also reported that heavy bombers started many fires when bombing an airfield in the Visayas, 15 aircraft being destroyed on the ground. Liberatorsdropped 49 tons on Opon airfield (Mactan Island, off Cebu), obtaining hits on the runway and dispersal area.A Liberator attacked and sank a 7,000-ton tanker off Tawatawi Island (SuluArchipelago).Allied aircraft attacked shipping off Iwojima in the Kazan Group, and bombed the island. Liberators also attacked shipping off Chichijima (OgasawaraGroups27 tons), and twice bombed this island and that of Hahajima.In the Celebes Liberators bombed Macassar, dropping 31 tons and startingat least 100 fires in the waterfront and dockyard areas.In the Amboina and Timor groups, Mitchells caused several fires whenattacking Atamboea and a camp near Koepang.Medium bombers and fighters inflicted damage to barnack buildings and stores dumps in the Wasile Bay area (Halmahera), and others caused severalfires and damaged buildings at Piroe (Ceram).In New Guinea hits were obtained on the runway at Babo airfield, whileenemy personnel and stores were successfully attacked at Wewak.In New Britain enemy supply areas near Rabanl were attacked by Dauntlessand Corsairs, and offensive sweeps made over Gazelle Peninsula.In the Carolines Super Fortresses on two occasions bombed the submarinebase at Dublon on Truk Island, dropping a total of 80 tons; the operations werehampered by cloud. . Other Allied aircraft operated over Yap, three timesbombing the landing-strip and twice attacking Peleliu and Babelthuap.- Corsairs obtained hits on a power plant at Taroa in the Marshalls, and also bombed Emidj and Jaluit.In the marinas Corsairs and Thunderbolts effectively machine-gunned Rotaand Pagan.- Enemy air activity was directed mainly against the Leyte Gulf area, whereAllied shipping was attacked several times, on one occasion with some success.Incomplete reports indicate that Tacloban airfield was heavily raided on the night3rd/4th.Sixty-four enemy aircraft were destroyed in combat and by A.A. during theperiod under review.ENEMY ACTIVITY AND HOME SECURITY.General.58. Flying Bombs. Attacks were made on 4 nights; 4th/5th, 5th/6th,6th/7th and 8th/9th, all in the evening. Ninety-five flying bombs were plotted,38 crossed the coast; 36 were shot down, 6 by fighters, 30 by A.A.
On the evening of the 5th, 30 flying bombs were plotted, the largest numberyet launched by aircraft in one attack, lasting more than an hour. It wasnoticeable that most of the enemy&apos;s activity took place off the Kent coast and the outer estuary of the Thames. The flying bombs all crossed the coast betweenNew Beniney and the Isle of Sheppey but the strikes on land occurred over widelyseparate areas. Again on the evening of the 8th, when 28 bombs were plottedover a period of an hour, most of the 13 incidents were .in Kent.Generally, over the week, incidents were more or less equally distributed between East Suffolk, Essex and Kent with rather fewer in Sussex.  None fell in-J-T-i j-\   T   /&quot;\T&quot;l /&quot;&quot;I y\&quot;n    OTIQOLong-range rockets. Incidents have been reported on 6 days and 3 nights.23 fell on land compared to 38 in the previous week. Of these, 9 fell in London,9 in Essex, 4 in Kent and 1 in Bedfordshire.Damage.59. Flying Bombs. On the evening of the 8th some 20 houses weredemolished in each of Rochester and Swanscombe, and at Rochester there were6 fatal casualties. Otherwise damage during the week has nowhere been extensiveand in no other incident have more than 2 or 3 fatal casualties been reported.Long-range rockets. Five railway tracks were blown up in a marshalling yardand normal working has not yet been resumed. In- a few incidents some 12 to20 houses were demolished and extensive blast damage has occasionally beenreported, but in no incident has the damage been very widespread. In one incidentthere were 31 fatal and 84 serious casualties and in another, 16 fatal and31 serious.Casualties.60. Estimated civilian casualties for the week ending 0600 on the 8thwere : By flying bombs In London : Nil.Outside London : 1 killed, 4 serious.By long-range rockets In London : 66 killed, 204 serious.Outside London : 16 killed, 33 serious.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.Germany.Bochum. Cover of the town centre obtained after the Bomber command attack on the 4th/5th November is of poor quality and obscured by smoke fromfires still burning ten hours after the attack. Damage, however, is seen to bevery heavy both to industrial and residential property. Blast furnaces and rolling mills were severely affected and there is further damage to the railwayroundhouse and to buildings adjoining the station.Brunswick. Further photographs, taken after the Bomber Command attackon the 14th/15th October, show that almost the whole of the old town which lies within the old city moat has been gutted and large areas, especially in thenorth-west, have been devastated. Outside the old town there is severe firedamage, particularly to the east, and throughout the town business and residentialdamage is severe. &quot; Among industries that have suffered are the Flugzeug-reparaturfabrik (aircraft repairs), which has been gutted, and the Panther Werke(motor cycles, &amp;c), which has received moderate damage. The main railway station has been gutted and the Statehouse, the Rathaus, the Ministry building and the Deutsche Bank have all been damaged in varying degree.Brunswick I Bussing. The U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 22nd October causeddamage throughout the N.A.G. Vereinigte Nutzkraftwagen plant (militaryvehicles, &amp;c.) and particularly in the western part, where almost every largebuilding has been damaged.Damage has also been inflicted on Vereinigte Eisenbahn Signalwerke(railway equipment) and on the Reichsbahn-Ausbesserungswerke (railway work-shops), which have suffered very heavily. Some damage was also caused in thesouth marshalling yards.Dortmund-Ems Canal Embankment (Ladbergen). As a result of the bomber command attack on the 4th/5th November, severe damage was caused on theembanked stretch of the canal, especially on the eastern branch of the by-passwhere two lengths of the embankment totalling nearly 1,50.0 feet have been destroyed. In addition two bombs have pierced that part of the by-pass whichleads over the River Glane, syphoned underneath, leaving a hole 7 x 130 feetwhich goes down to the river-bed. The western branch of the by-pass shows12 craters on the embankment in the area of the safety gate. As a result of all this damage both the by-passes are impassable, the water having drained into the surrounding countryside leaving the canal beds exposed.Gelsenkirchen.-In the small part of the town covered the Bomber command attack of the 6th November is seen to have caused intense fires north and south ofthe Central Station yard and in the vicinity of the Hessler district. South ofthe Industriel-Hafen, the steel castings works of Vereinigte Stahlwerke, A.G.are also seen to be on fire.Minden. As a result of the U.S.A.A.F. attack on the 26th October an80-f t. breach has been made in the embankment 200 yards east of the aqueduct onthe Mittelland canal. The aqueduct is completely drained, together with 600 yards of the adjacent canal, and for 1\ miles east to the limit of cover, drainage isalmost complete. At least five barges have been carried through the break inthe embankment and 15 have been grounded in the canal while two or threemore in the river immediately north of the pit sluice and locks have been damaged. Some residential damage has been caused in sparsely built-up countrynorth of the canal.
