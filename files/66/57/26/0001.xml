THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 626.6th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.RECRUITMENT TO THE CIVIL SERVICE DURING THERECONSTRUCTION PERIOD.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. On Thursday, the 2nd November (W.M. (44) 145th Conclusions, Minute 6)the War Cabinet approved in principle the proposals in my memorandum(W.P. (44) 598) about Recruitment to the Civil Service during the ReconstructionPeriod. At the same time they invited me to give further consideration to thequestion of how the measure of ex-Service reservation proposed could best be presented, and to report again to the Cabinet after I had received a deputationof Members of Parliament who had asked to see me on this question.2. I am receiving that deputation to-morrow morning, and thereafter Ishall be in a position to make an oral report to the Cabinet. In the meantime Ihave been considering how the ex-Service point should be handled. I have cometo the conclusion that the statement of Government policy (of which a draft wasenclosed with W.P. (44) 598) should be amplified in order to include a clear andconcise statement of the Government^ views. For that purpose I would suggest the insertion of a passage in the following terms : 1&quot; After second paragraph of &quot; Statement by the Government &quot; insert: In the consideration which they have given to the Report, the Governmenthave examined the committee recommendations with particular care in orderto satisfy themselves that the various proposals carry out the policy of theGovernment, as announced earlier in the year by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,that any arrangements made for recruitment to the Civil Service immediatelyafter the war should ensure that generous treatment is given to suitable candidatesfrom the Forces. The Government believe that public opinion will endorse theconclusion that, at the end of a war during which we have had total mobilisation of man-power, a proposal to reserve all vacancies in the Civil Service exclusivelyfor ex-Service candidates would be unfair to the rest of the community. They,like those in the Armed Forces, have played their part in the national war effort.They, too, have lost their normal opportunities of competing for the Civil Serviceand may be faced with the problem of starting afresh on a new career. None theless, there is a very special debt due to the men in the Fighting Forces a debtwhich in the Governmenfs view would rightly be met not by depriving all others of the opportunity of competing for the Civil Service, but by reserving asubstantial proportion of vacancies for those ex-Service men who wish, and are qualified, to enter the permanent Civil Service of the Crown. Action of this kind would add one more measure to the numerous proposals already formulated by theGovernment to facilitate the resettlement of ex-Service men.The Government note the Committee&apos;s recommendation that of the vacanciesavailable for the reconstruction competitions not less than 75 per cent, in theadministrative class, 66f per cent, in the executive class, and 50 per cent, inthe clerical class should be filled by suitably qualified ex-Service men, additionalvacancies being reserved for ex-Service women. This will be achieved by specificreservations of those varying percentages, coupled with the provision that, ifex-Service men obtain in free competition more vacancies than would actuallvbe reserved, they would be entitled to them. The Government appreciate the[28545]
reasons for these varying percentages, as given in paragraphs 22-25 of theReport. In particular, they recognise that any substantial increases of thesepercentages would entail a discrimination against women, who have for 20 years been admitted to the Civil Service on equal terms with men, which would be particularly unjust, bearing in mind the contribution made by women duringthe war. After careful review they are satisfied that these arrangementsconstitute the generous treatment which is essential. In these circumstances theproposals in the Report meet with the approval of the Government and arecommended to Parliament and to the public.&quot;3. For convenience of reference I attach a copy of the draft statement ofGovernment policy as amended by the inclusion of the passage suggested above.4. Apart from the actual wording of the Government statement, it will be important to secure, by means of a Press conference on the day of the releaseof the White Paper; that the Press have a proper understanding of the recruit-nient proposals and of the Government view thereon. More at leisure, but inadvance of any debate on the subject, it will be necessary to take steps to explainand elaborate these proposals to interested Members of Parliament. I would propose to make suitable arrangements under both of these heads.J. A.Treasury Chambers,6th November, 1944.ANNEX.Revised Preface to Whitley Council Report.At page below will be found the report of the committee of the CivilService National Whitley Council which, in accordance with the Government&apos;request, has been considering the arrangements to be made for the resumption of recruitment to the permanent Service.The report proceeds on the basis envisaged in the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer reprinted at page below that recruitment to the permanentService should begin at the earliest possible moment after the end of hostilities inEurope, continuing steadily throughout the reconstruction period, in order toprovide for the required intake by Departments of appropriately qualified menand women, and for the smooth transfer into permanent employment of thoseselected, whether from the Fighting Forces or otherwise. The Minister of Labourand National Service has already announced the Governments plans for the releaseor transfer to civil employment of men and women from the Forces after theconclusion of hostilities in Europe; and while, as he states, general demobilisationcannot take place until the total defeat of the Axis Powers throughout the world,the interests both of the Public Service and of the men and women affected require that any who are released during the interim period should have an immediateopportunity of entering the permanent Civil Service if they wish to do so and are suitable for it.In the consideration which they have given to the Report, the Governmenthave examined the Committee&apos;s recommendations with particular care in orderto satisfy themselves that the various proposals carry out the policy of theGovernment, as announced earlier in the year by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,that any arrangements made for recruitment to the Civil Service immediatelyafter the war should ensure that generous treatment is given to suitable candidatesfrom the Forces. The Government believe that public opinion will endorse theconclusion that, at the end of a war during which we have had total mobilisation of man-power, a proposal to reserve all vacancies in the Civil Service exclusivelyfor ex-Service candidates would be unfair to the rest of the community. They,like those in the Armed Forces, have played their part in the national war effort.They, too, have lost their normal opportunities of competing for the Civil Serviceand may be faced with the problem of starting afresh on a new career. None theless, there is a very special debt due to the men in the Fighting Forces a debtwhich in the Governments view would rightly be met not by depriving all others of the opportunity of competing for the Civil Service, but by reserving asubstantial proportion of vacancies for those ex-Service men who wish, and are
qualified, to enter the permanent Civil Service of the Crown. Action of this kind would add one more measure to the numerous proposals already formulated by theGovernment&apos; to facilitate the resettlement of ex-Service men.The Government note the Committee&apos;s recommendation that of the vacanciesavailable for the reconstruction competitions not less than 75 per cent, in theadministrative class, 66f per cent, in the executive class, and 50 per cent, inthe clerical class should be filled by suitably qualified ex-Service men, additionalvacancies being reserved for ex-Service women. This will be achieved by specificreservations of those varying percentages, coupled with the provision that, ifex-Service men obtain in free competition more vacancies than would actuallybe reserved, they would be entitled to them. The Government appreciate thereasons for these varying percentages, as given in paragraphs 22-25 of theReport. In particular, they recognise that any substantial increases of thesepercentages would entail a discrimination against women, who have for 20 years been admitted to the Civil Service on equal terms with men, which would be particularly unjust, bearing in mind the contribution made by women duringthe war. After careful review they are satisfied that these arrangementsconstitute the generous treatment which is essential. In these circumstances theproposals in the Report meet with the approval of the Government and arecommended to Parliament and to the public.Arrangements for recruitment to the future Civil Service presuppose ageneral conception of the future work of the Service. The responsibilities whichsuccessive Governments will undertake after this war will differ in volume and tosome extent in kind from those which were undertaken before the war. Mean-while, however, as indicated, the opening of recruitment cannot be deferred. Sofar as proves necessary, adjustments can subsequently be made to meet new developments or any changes in the structure of the Service.In the adjustment of the Civil Service to new developments and newdemands the training is also a matter of primary importance. The report of acommittee under the Chairmanship of the Financial Secretary to the treasury on the training of civil servants after the war has been presented in a previous white Paper (Cmd. 6525). While the proposals in that report have still to. be worked out in detail, the Government accept the recommendations in principle.They believe that the recruitment and training reports taken together will conduceto maintaining at the highest level of efficiency a Service which must, undersuccessive Governments, undertake tasks of growing difficulty and variety in theyears to come.It will be observed that both these reports are written almost entirely round the administrative, executive and clerical classes of the Civil Service. That is partly because these classes compose and must continue to compose the mainstream of the Civil Service, and partly because they are more or less homogeneous.But the professional, scientific and technical classes of the Civil Service, althoughless numerous, are equally important; and it is certainly of equal importance that well-qualified men and women should be recruited to these classes in thepost-war years, and should be given proper opportunities and encouragement for making their special contribution.Departments employing these staffs are now engaged in formulatingproposals for them which will, as far as possible, incorporate the principlesalready recommended for the general classes. This is not a simple problem.Necessarily, the precise arrangements to be made for securing to the public serviceappropriately qualified scientists, medical officers, lawyers, economists,statisticians, architects, engineers, surveyors, &amp;c, differ from profession toprofession. Further, the range of work in the different Departments covered bythese various grades is very wide and varied, with the result that the applicationof common principles is an exceedingly difficult matter. It is, however, expectedthat the matter will shortly be sufficiently advanced for discussion with CivilService staff representatives to take place through the Whitley machinery.The Government have decided to retain after the war a central body ofeconomists and statisticians such as has been set up in the Cabinet Offices duringthe war.Preparatory work is also being undertaken on other questions affecting thefuture Civil Service. Discussions are taking place in the National whitley council on a number of problems that will arise on redundancy as the work of
Departments contracts, and on the question whether any changes require to bemade in the main structure of the Service, that is to say, the grades and classes, -the methods of passing from one class to another, and the general arrangementsdesigned to secure that the best use is made of all members of the staff.Preliminary consideration has also been given to the question whetherthe existing superannuation arrangements are sufficiently flexible, to the positionof unestablished staff and to the effect of the new social insurance scheme on thepensions of the Public Services.On these questions further statements will be made as may prove to benecessary.J
