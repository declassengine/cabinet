(44) 613.2nd November, 1944.WAR CABINET.RELIEF  FOR OCCUPIED EUROPE.Report by the Chiefs of Staff.WE have considered the military implications of the recommendations* ofthe Joint Anglo-American Relief Committee regarding the despatch of relief to German Occupied Europe in the light of the discussion at the meeting of theWar Cabinet on the 16th October, 1944. t2. We have also considered requests from the Netherlands Government thatwe should agree to the despatch of supplies to Holland : (i) from Sweden in a Swedish ship;(ii) from Lisbon via Sweden in a Red Cross strip;(iii) alternatively to (i) and (ii) above, by aircraft dropping over or in thevicinity of the three big towns in Western Holland (i.e., Rotterdam,Amsterdam and The Hague);(iv) from Basle to Rotterdam or the towns on the Soutti-East of the ZuyderZee in a Red Cross ship via the River Rhine.3.   We are of the opinion that  &apos;   ,(i) In view of the small tonnage of supplies involved in the recommenda-tions put forward by the Relief Committee, the assistance whichmight be given to the enemy in Occupied Europe would be acceptablefrom the military point of view,(ii) There is no military objection to increased supplies being sent to Norwayprovided that they are routed overland from Sweden.&apos; (iii) Apart from the fact that our own prisoners of war are already short of Red Cross parcels and that the sending of supplies to Poland andto other countries involving a route over the mainland of Europe willaggravate this shortage, there is no strictly military objection to supplies being sent to these particular countries.  It should, however,be made clear to the International Red Cross that safe conduct from air attack cannot be given for supplies delivered overland,(iv) There is no military objection to fhe proposals that supplies should besent to Holland from Sweden in a Swedish ship or from Lisbon viaSweden in a Red Cross ship.   General Eisenhower has agreed with both these proposals.* W.P. (44) 568.f W.M. (44) 137th Conclusions, Minute 9.[28516]
(v) The proposal that supplies should be dropped by air over the three bigtowns in Western Holland is unacceptable on military grounds. Itis not feasible to arrange safe conduct for the aircraft involved and- there could be no guarantee that the supplies would reach the civilpopulation in fact, the probability is quite the reverse.(vi) It would not be possible to grant safe conduct for a Red Cross shipcarrying supplies from Basle via the Rhine to Rotterdam. We have asked General Eisenhower for his views.(Signed) A. E. BROOKE.C. PORTAL.ANDREW CUNNINGHAM.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.W. 1,2nd November, 1944.
