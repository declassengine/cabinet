WAR CABINETCOMPULSORY POSTING OF A.T.S. OVERSEASMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. On joining the A.T.S. all recruits are required to undertake a General Serviceagreement to serve wherever they are required, but hitherto it has been the policy to sendoverseas only those auxiliaries who are volunteers.2. I have now reached a point where I am unable to meet overseas demands for A.T.S.,even to replace normal wastage, if I continue to restrict overseas posting to volunteers only.Every effort has been made to stimulate volunteering but with little success. The lack of volunteers is due not so much to reluctance on the part of the women themselves as to theattitude of their relatives, who put pressure on them to stay in this country.3. I understand that the policy with regard to posting overseas now in force in the caseof the W.R.N.S. and the W.A.A.F. is as follows :-W.R.N.S.Women enrolled after 23rd September, 1943, are subject to compulsory draftingoverseas except that in no case are married women with family responsibilitiestowards their husbands or children ordered overseas.W.A.A.F.Overseas service is restricted to volunteers but no married women are accepted.With regard to theW.A.A.F., I understand that the Air Ministry did not find it necessaryto send any appreciable numbers overseas until April, 1944, so that there are presumablyplenty of volunteers still available. In the case of the A.T.S., we have been sendingvolunteers overseas ever since October, 1940.4. A year ago, in answer to a question in the House on the regulations regarding overseas service for the A.T.S., I said : &quot; Only auxiliaries who volunteer are accepted for service overseas. They mustbe recommended by an A.T.S. officer not below the rank of Senior commander, andthey must be of a certain medical standard. They can only be accepted if they are20 years of age and have no children under 14 &quot;.Now that stable conditions prevail in certain overseas theatres, many duties can beundertaken there by A.T.S., thus releasing soldiers for duty elsewhere. The demands forA.T.S. from overseas commands now far exceed the number of volunteers and, in this respect,the position is likely to become progressively worse. Moreover, it will become increasingly difficult to restrict the overseas tour for A.T.S. to the present maximum of three years if weare unable to provide the necessary replacements from home.5. It will assist, and probably enable, me to meet all the A.T.S. commitments for over-seas, if I can compulsorily draft single women of and over 21 years of age, to those overseastheatres in which prevailing conditions of service and climate are suitable for women. Iwould propose to send married women and women between 19 and 21 years of age overseasonly if they volunteered in accordance with the existing procedure. Moreover, I wouldrestrict posting overseas for operational duties (e.g., in Mixed Heavy A.A. Batteries) tovolunteers.6. As far as I can ascertain no pledge on the subject of overseas service was given whenconscription for women was introduced in December, 1941, and in order to make the best useof this Service, I invite the agreement of the War Cabinet to the compulsory drafting overseas,of single A.T.S. personnel of 21 years of age or over.-p    t   Cjt. j.  vj.the war office,xst November, 1944.(b44/188)   no   11/44   W.O.p.   19761Printed for the War Cabinet, November, 1944SECRET -   -Copy No.  36W.P.
