NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. A convoy has arrived in-North Russia without loss. Naval aircraft have successfully attacked shipping off the Norwegian coast.R.M. Commandos have been landed on Walcheren with supporting fire fromland, sea and air.Allied submarines have inflicted casualties on enemy shipping in theS.W. Pacific.Two U-boats haw been sunk one prohablv sunk, and one nossiblv sunk.Northern Waters.2. A convoy including 25 cargo ships, five tankers and six Russiansubmarine chasers,&apos; escorted by ships of the Home Fleet, arrived in North Russiaduring the week. There were no casualties among the convoy or its escorts, but one Swordfish was lost.3. On the 24th H.M. ships Devonshire (cruiser), Trumpeter andCampania (escort carriers), with six destroyers, completed a mine-laying operationoff the Norwegian coast. One naval aircraft was lost, but the pilot was saved.In addition, naval aircraft damaged three radar stations, an observation postand a wireless station.4. Naval aircraft from H.M.S. Implacable (fleet carrier), escorted by ships of the Home Fleet, attacked shipping in the leads between Bodo and Rorvik onthe 26th and 27th, and at Lodingen on the 28th. Two 5,000-ton cargo ships, an escort ship, a landing craft, a minesweeper, and two small cargo ships were sunk. A flak ship and a trawler were driven ashore, and seven cargo ships, fivelanding craft, an escort ship and the radar station at Eggum were damaged orset on fire.   Four naval aircraft were lost.On the 25th H.M.S. Volage (destroyer) picked up three Norwegians and fourFrenchmen who had sailed from Norway 18 days before.On the 21st H.M.S/M Sceptre sank a cargo ship and set another on fire inan escorted convoy north-west of Ekersund.Home Waters. ......5. During the night of the 29th/30th, there was some coastal force activityoff the Dutch coast. M.T.B.S set an E-boat on fire and R-boats were damaged by gunfire. Two M.T.B.S were slightly damaged. On the following nightH.M.S. Stevenstone (destroyer) drove off E-boats west of Ostend and sank one ofthem.   M.T.B.s engaged minesweepers off Ijmuiden.6. Early on the 1st, Royal Marine Commandos carried out two assaultsagainst Flushing and the gap in the Westkapelle dyke already created by bomber command. The former which embarked at Breskens in assault landing craftwas successful, but the latter which left Ostend in tank landing craft was strongly opposed and there were heavy casualties in craft and men. Low cloud preventedair support till the afternoon, when H.M. ships Warspite (battleship), Erebusand Roberts (monitors) bombarded enemy batteries with the help of spottingaircraft, and rocket-firing Typhoons also attacked. Shelling of beaches preventedstore-carrying craft from unloading in daylight. By the evening the corps commander was reported to be satisfied with the general progress of the operation.7. Considerable progress has been made with the reconstitution of the liberated ports of France and Belgium. At Calais the channel through the block-ships is now 120 feet wide and it is expected that shortly all the wrecks in theport will have been dispersed. At Havre seven berths are available for medium-sized ships and ten berths for coasters. At Granville eight coasters can beberthed in the inner basin. The Seine is navigable for ships of medium draughtand 14 berths are available at Rouen. The entrance channel at Ostend has beenwidened by the removal of a sunk hopper; the lock is expected to be clear bythe 4th.        ___________ &apos;8. On individual days during the week ending the 28th, some 28,000 tonsof petrol and stores were landed at Cherbourg, some 7,300 tons at Ostend, some5,000 tons at Havre and over 7,500 tons at Dieppe.During the week ending the 30th, combined British and U.S. dischargesthrough the liberated ports of France and Belgium totalled approximately24,000 men, 6,000 vehicles, 225,000 tons of supplies and 80,000 tons of petrol./
9. On the 1st, H.M.S, Whitaker (frigate), escorting a homebound convoy,was torpedoed by a U-boat off the north coast of Ireland (R) but reached port.H.M.S. Colsay (danlayer) was sunk by an underwater explosion off Ostendon the 2nd.Mediterranean.Gulf of Genoa.10. On the night of the 23rd/24th, coastal forces inflicted considerable damage on a convoy of five or six ships between Spezia and Genoa. Next day theU.S.S. Woolsey (destroyer) and the French destroyer Le Fortune sank twoabandoned explosive motor-boats off Nice. Woolsey also shelled enemy positions on shore. On the 27th, the French cruiser Jeanne d&apos; Arc and the U.S. destroyerPlunkett and on the 28th the French cruiser Emile Bertin with two U.S. destroyersshelled enemy positions ashore where the German mobile guns are constantly beingmoved. During the night of the 27th/28th, coastal forces sank three F-lightersentering Rapallo in an escorted convoy. On the 30th and 31st, the Frenchdestroyer Forbin, the U.S. destroyer Madison and the Emile Bertin shelled motor transport, troop concentrations and pillboxes on the Franco-Italian frontier.Seven floating mines were also destroyed.At Toulon 88,068 tons of stores, 15,562 troops and 12,155 vehicles have so far been landed.A driatic. .11. On the 27th, H.M.S. Lamerton (destroyer) intercepted the Germanhospital carrier Freiburg off Durazzo and brought her into Brindisi for examina-tion. On the night of the lst/2nd H.M.S. WheaMand (destroyer) engaged a destroyer south-east of Pola.aegean.12. On the 25th and 26th enemy positions on Milo were shelled byH.M. ships Aurora (cruiser), Tyrian and Tetcott (destroyers) and were bombed by naval aircraft from H.M.S. Emperor (escort carrier) which covered the landingparty. H.M.S. Sirius (cruiser) put troops ashore on Piskopi on the 28th. Alliedreinforcements were landed from the Greek destroyer Navarinon and naval aircraft from H.M.S. A ttacker (escort carrier) provided cover for landing parties and put several enemy landing craft out of action.On the 23rd, a landing party was put ashore on Skopelos, in the northernSporades, from H.M.S. Teazer (destroyer) and the Navarinon; it was found thatthe Germans had previously withdrawn.H.M.S. Kimberley (destroyer) intercepted the German hospital ship Gradiscaand brought her into Alexandria for-examination.*Greece.13. On the 28th, 1,130 tons of stores and 30 vehicles were landed at Piraeus,and on the next day 1,666 tons of stores, 948. tons of Swedish relief stores and69 vehicles were disembarked. Shortage of harbour craft, bad weather and lackof labour has hindered discharges.The final demolitions are reported to have been carried out at Salonika onthe 30th. Reconnaissance on that day showed ten small launches and 25 caiques.The minelayer Zeus and the s.s. Lola were sunk at the entrance to the innerharbour. The explosive store has been blown up and extensive demolitions couldbe seen on quays, moles, bridges and harbour installations.East Indies.14. On the 6th October, H.M. S/M Statesman sank two motor coasters east of the Andaman Islands.Pacific.15.   The total damage done to the Japanese Fleet in the Philippines cannot yet be finally established, especially since remnants of it are still being harassed[28491] B
by submarines and aircraft, but it is known that one 14&quot; battleship, one large -carrier, two heavy cruisers and two destroyers were sunk,; another 14&quot; battle-ship, three converted carriers and two light cruisers were probably sunk and twoheavy cruisers and one light cruiser damaged.   The U.S. light fleet carrierPrinceton, two escort carriers, three destroyers and several M.T.B.S were sunk.  ..U.S. light forces have sunk a number of Japanese coasters and troop-ladenbarges off the west coast of Leyte which it is assumed were bringing reinforcements to the island.16. British.and Allied submarines have extended their activities into thesouth-west Pacific. On the 4th October, Sea Rover sank a lighter and drove ashorea coaster in the Flores Sea. Between the 8th and the 16th, Sturdy sank threecoasters and nine schooners off the south coast of the Celebes. The Dutch S/MZwaardvisch, on patrol in the Java Sea between the 4th and 20th, sank theJapanese minelayer Itsukushima, a German U-boat (see Anti-Submarine Opera-tions), a 2,000-ton cargo ship, a small tanker and a coaster. Another minelayerwas torpedoed.Anti-Sub marine Operations.17. Thirteen attacks were reported during the week, six by shore-based aircraft and seven by warships.On the 6th October, the Dutch S/M Zwaardvisch sank a German U-boatnorth-west of Sourabaya; prisoners were taken. On the 29th, aircraft from it.M.S. Implacable drove a U-boat ashore on the Norwegian coast which was later destroyed by Liberators. On the 24th H.M. S/M Stygian probably sank one off Sabang, and corvettes of the 31st Escort Group possibly sank one in theS.W. Approaches on the following day.During October two U-boats were sunk, two probably sunk and four possiblysunk.Enemy Intelligence.18. Reconnaissance of Gdynia on the 27th located the Scheer, nurnberg,lutzow, Hipper, Leipzig and one old battleship.Between April and October one Narvik and three Elbing class destroyers,four minesweepers, seven escort vessels, 26 landing craft and two sperrbrechers,have been completed in Germany. Sixteen destroyers, nine minesweepers, twoescort vessels, &apos;two sperrbrechers and 17 landing craft are under construction.Some minesweepers and landing craft have been constructed from pre-fabricatedsections.U-Boats.19. The situation remains quiet in the Atlantic, but there has been someactivity off the north coast of Ireland (R) and in the Western approaches of theEnglish Channel.It is estimated that there are now between 280 and 320 U-boats in commis-sion, 20 to 30 of which are of the latest type. Sixty old type U-boats and approximately 80 of the new types are building and fitting out.Enemy Attack on Shipping.20. A US. ship was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat 900 miles north-east of Hawaii.A small British tanker was mined in the Seine and is a total loss. Anothersmall tanker was damaged by an underwater explosion off Ostend.Provisional shipping losses by enemy action during October were four ships of 11,668 tons. Marine casualties raised the total of losses from all causes to11 ships of 27,608 tons.Allied Minelaying.21. Aircraft of Bomber Command have laid mines in the Heligoland Bightand in the approaches to Oslo. Naval aircraft have laid mines off the norwegian coast.Mines have been laid off Penang.  .
Enemy Minelaying, Allied Minesweeping.22.   There have been no reports of minelaying in Home Waters.Mines have probably been laid ofT Walcheren and possibly off Ijmuiden; andit is reported that the approaches to Gothenburg and Copenhagen have been mined by the enemy.Enemy aircraft laid mines in four places in the Danube below Turnu--Severinduring the night of the 16th/17th.Nine mines have been destroyed in the Seine approaches.23. A B.Y.M/S. was mined and sunk at the entrance to the Gulf ofCorinth on the 25th. Sweeping is now m progress in the approaches to Itea onthe north side of the Gulf of Corinth.On the Dalmatian coast sweeping off Gruz, north-west of Dubrovnik, was nearly complete at the end of last week- and the first convoy was due to enter thatharbour on the 25th.In September, 75 mines were destroyed in the Ancona area.The mine totals are 5,796 ground and 6,518 moored.Enemy Merchant Shipping.24. Between the 1st and 15th October, 17 enemy ships, totalling 26,537 tons,were sunk or captured or became constructive total losses. Of these eight ships,totalling 14,530 tons, were lost in the Mediterranean,25. At least five large transports are now engaged in moving troops fromOslo to Denmark. Five ferries in the Great Belt have been commandeered fortroop movements.Swedish Iron Ore.26. Shipments of Swedish iron ore to enemy Europe during September 1944totalled some 250,000 tons. This compares with some 550,000 tons in August1944, and with 1,100,000 tons in September 1943. Of the total for September,about 65 per cent, was shipped through Swedish ports and the remainder throughNarvik. Shipments through Swedish ports are now forbidden, and it is reportedthat the Swedes will not allow the stocks of iron ore at Narvik to exceed 40,000tons; should they persist in their refusal, it is unlikely that the enemy could shipmore than.100,000 tons to 150,000 tons a month through this port. If during thelast quarter of 1944 the enemy succeeds in exporting 450,000 tons through Narvik,his total for the year will be less than five million tons. This will- be less than half of the amount which was shipped during 1943.MILITARY SITUATIONWestern Europe.    (An outline map is included as an inset.)General.27. The principal development during the past week has been the progressof the Allied drive towards the River Maas. By the 1st November, the British. thrust from the east of the Nijmegen salient reached the Maas three miles east ofGertruidenberg, while the Allied advance from the south reached the line of theDmtel Mark Canal, where enemy rear guards are resisting stubbornly. canadian and British forces have occupied South Beveland and, in conjunction with the.British landings on Walcheren, are fighting across the causeway for a foothold onthe island.In the Scheldt pocket Canadian forces have been closing in upon the lastcentre of enemy resistance.Southern Group of A armies.28. West of Belfort there has been active patrolling and numerous exchanges of artillery fire. Enemy counter-attacks have been repulsed by French forces inthe vicinity of Cornimont. West of St. Die, IJ.S. forces have made steady progress, and are established on the high ground within one mile of the town.Central Group of Armies.29. There has been active patrolling throughout this sector, but no major development.- TJ.S. forces have liberated Maizieres-les-Metz, six miles north ofMetz, and limited gains have been made N.E. of Aix-la-Chapelle.[28491] &quot; &apos; b2
Northern Group of Armies.30. On the 27th October, an enemy attack developed against the eastern flankofethe Nijmegen salient, and our troops were forced to withdraw from Meijel andLiesel. By the 31st, our troops had regained most of the lost ground andstabilised their positions in that sector.The Second British Army&apos;s drive towards the Maas has maintained itsmomentum. Tilburg and Udenhout were liberated on the 27th, and on the next day troops of the First Canadian Army occupied Bergen-op-Zoom, and reached the outskirts of Breda and Roosendaal. On the 29th, Polish troops occupied Breda,and British troops cleared Roosendaal, and by the 1st, troops of the Second british army were three miles east of Gertruidenberg. Further west troops of the FirstCanadian Army had reached the line of the Dintel Mark Canal, but here resistancestiffened, the enemy fiercely counter-attacking our small bridgehead over the canalwest of Oosterhout.To the west, the Canadian advance into South Beveland reached the westernend of the Isthmus on the 27th, and on the 1st, Canadian troops were within50 yards of the western end of the causeway leading to Walcheren. This advance was assisted by a seaborne assault by British troops who landed at the S.E. corner of South Beveland on the 26th, and joined up with the Canadian forces on the29th. Our troops have taken more than 2,000 prisoners during the operations against South Beveland.On the 1st, Canadian troops secured a bridgehead over the causeway on toWalcheren Island, and on the same day, British troops made assault landings atFlushing and at Westkapelle. Both landings were opposed, but firm bridgeheadswere secured.Canadian troops have been steadily reducing the enemy pocket south of the scheldt estuary, and enemy resistance is now limited to the vicinity of Knocke,where street fighting &quot;is in progress.On the 29th, Czech troops took 350 prisoners in a raid on the enemy garrison at Dunkirk.Italy.31. During the first half of the week, the bad weather persisted in the eighth Army&apos;s sector, so that attempts to cross the Ronco anywhere in the area ofHighway 9 were unsuccessful. The advance towards Ravenna, up to the coastroad, continues, however, largely without contact, and by the end of the periodforward troops were within five miles of the outskirts of the city.The first crossing of the Ronco came on the 28th, when Indian forces secured a bridgehead two miles south of Meldola, which they gradually strengthened andenlarged during the ensuing days. On the 31st, with greatly improved weather,a further bridgehead was established immediately south of Highway 9 and bythe 1st, a class 9 bridge had been constructed here. By this time, the indian troops had secured Meldola.To the left of the Indian troops, Polish forces have continued to make progressnorthwards towards Forli, and have secured Predappio, the birth-place of mussolini.The news from the Fifth Army is very scant. The weather has also been badhere and the exhaustion of the troops, after their long fighting advance oververy difficult mountainous country, is becoming manifest. The most noteworthyprogress has been by a British armoured formation operating on the extremeright flank of the army. Here, considerable gains have been made betweenTredozio and Rocca San Casciano.The only other news is of an attack on the 30th, by the BrazilianExpeditionary Force across the high country east of the River&quot; Serrchio, whichwas greeted by enemy counter-attacks on the following day.Greece.32. Light British forces based on Skiathos entered Salonika on the 30th,having landed previously in the Chalchidike peninsula. Contact is being maintained with the enemy in the north of the town.A combined attack was made on Milo in the Cyclades on the 24th, and abridgehead was secured but the Germans are still resisting strongly.The island of Piskopi in the Dodecanese was seized by British naval forces.The enemy counter-attacked strongly, and our force was successfully withdrawnon the 31st with few casualties.
The political situation continues to be quiet, and, the Greek Governmenthas issued a decree dissolving all irregular forces and conscripting four annualRelief stores are now arriving regularly in Athens.Eastern European Front.   (An outline map is included as an inset.)Finland.33. The Russians crossed the Norwegian frontier in the extreme northand captured the port of Kirkenes on the 25th. The Germans are still with -drawing northwards from Central Finland, followed up by the Finns, who donot appear to be exerting very great pressure.   -Northern Sector.34. Russian attacks in the Tukums-Libau area have, in the main, been held and no change of position has taken place.For some days the Russians continued their attacks in East Prussia, butthey met very stiff German resistance and counter-attacks and gained no furtherground.   This part of the front has been relatively quiet for the last few days.Central Sector.35. Along the River Narev, N.W. of Warsaw, Russian attacks have made some progress during the week.Southern Sector.36. The Germans have completed their withdrawal from their dangeroussalient in Transylvania and no German troops now remain on Roumanian soil.A fresh Russian advance in S.E. Hungary, resulting in the capture of Kecskemeton the 31st, has increased the threat to Budapest. In Northern Yugoslavia, too,the Russians have made further progress, capturing Novi Sad on the 27th andRuma the following day.Yugoslavia.37. All Yugoslav territory on the left bank of the Danube has now been cleared of the enemy, and Russian and Partisan forces have driven the enemyback to Mitrovica (40 miles west of Belgrade) which the Germans are defendingstubbornly.The enemy have recaptured Sjenica and Prijepolje (90 and .70 miles S.E.of Sarajevo respectively), and Visegrad (40 miles east of Sarajevo) in an effort to cut a corridor of escape for their forces in southern Yugoslavia and Albania.The Partisans, however, still hold the intervening country and have also isolatedthe force at Visegrad by capturing, two small towns behind it. Another Germanforce is trying to approach Visegrad from the area of Cacak (70 miles south ofBelgrade), but without much success.On the Dalmatian coast, the Partisans have occupied the ports of Makarskaand Split, and have strengthened their grip on the country inland by takingSinj. A small British force has landed at Dubrovnkniki to assist Partisan-activities.Burma.38. The Japanese defenders of Kennedy Peak are closely invested. allied troops from the Tiddim area have made an outflanking movement to the south,which is approaching Fort White, and a wide outflanking movement to the north,which has reached the area some thirteen miles N.E. of Kalemyo.In North Burma British troops, advancing down the Myitkyina-Mandalayrailway corridor, are one mile north of Mawlu. Chinese troops have made further progress in the area 16 miles N.E. of Bhamo.China.39. The Japanese have begun their drive on Kweilin. According to aChinese press communique, the Japanese have already reached the outskirts ofthe town.
Philippines.40 On the 24th U.S. troops landed on Samar Island and Babatngon, onthe Northern coast of Leyte, and are now in full possession of Samar. On Leytethey have occupied the town of Carigara, and now occupy nearly two-thirds ofthe island&apos;, including the coastline from Carigara down the east coast to Panaonisland.AIR SITUATION.Europe.United Kingdom.41. Flying bombs continued to be launched against this country. details are recorded under &quot; Enemy Activity and Home Security.&quot;Fighter Command flew 194 sorties against these attacks. One He. Ill bomb-launching aircraft was destroyed, and one probably destroyed.Home Waters.42. Home-based aircraft of Coastal Command flew 1,011 sorties; fiveaircraft are missing.Attacks were made on enemy shipping o&apos;ff the Norwegian and Dutch coasts;one 2,000-ton ship was set on fire and a small ship and an escort vessel were damaged.Bomber Command aircraft laid 108 sea-mines.Western Europe.43. -In the week ending 2100 hours on the 31st October, aircraft ofS.H.A.E.F. (Air) flew 7,137 sorties and dropped 2,280 tons of bombs. In the weekending dawn on the 2nd November, Bomber Command and the U.S. VIII bomber command flew 8,031 sorties and dropped 22,544 tons, while Fighter command and U.S. viii Fighter Command flew 3,529 sorties. Forty-seven enemy aircraft were destroyed and 16 were damaged; 112 Allied aircraft are missing.The main events of the week were heavy day and night attacks on enemy communications and on supply and industrial centres in Germany.Cologne, the principal target, was heavily attacked in daylight on the 28thand on the nights of the. 30th/31st and the 31st/lst, and on a small scale on three other nights; a total of 9,374 tons was dropped. On the 28th, no clouds were encountered at the start and visibility was good, but as the attack progressedthe target was obscured by cloud. The marking was accurate and a highlyconcentrated attack developed on the first aiming-point. A bridge across theriver is claimed as destroyed and many fires were soon raging throughout the target area. Difficulty was experienced in identifying the second aiming-point and sky markers were resorted to. Some crews, however, bombed visually wheregaps in cloud permitted. A Mosquito which flew over the city about four hoursafter the attack reported many fierce fires burning in a compact area, as well asnumerous fires in other parts of the city.On the night of the 30th/3Ist, there was thick cloud over the city, but reportsshow that an excellent concentration of markers was achieved and although cloudcover prevented an accurate assessment of results, the red glow of fire beneaththe clouds indicated that a satisfactory attack had been made. Prior to the attack on the night of the 31st/1st, 15 Mosquitoes bombed the city through cloud.After an interval of about \\ hours the main force arrived. Cloud conditions were still 10/10ths, but the sky markers were so well placed and compact thatthe main force had no difficulty in unloading their bombs on what crews described as the best sky marking so far experienced. - Conditions prevented any assessment of results other than the glow of fires seen through cloud. Mosquitoes whichbombed the city on the night of the lst/2nd reported that fires were still burningfrom the previous attacks.Among other communications targets bombed were munster (three attacks-1,102 tons), Hamm (three attacks-892 tons), an aqueduct on the Mittelland&apos;canal(760 tons) and Hanover (466 tons). Pathfinder technique was employed in these attacks and it is&quot; considered that the bombing results were good.Heavy attacks were also made on other types of targets, including synthetic oil plants at Homberg (819 tons), Bottrop (two attacks-693 tons), Gelsenkirchen
(611 tons), and Wesseling, near Cologne (527 tons); chemical works at Leverkusen(514 tons); two oil&quot;refineries at Hamburg (348 tons); locomotive and tank works at Hanover (327 tons); an ordnance depot at Bielefeld (492 tons); and Oberhausenin the Ruhr (1,191 tons). These attacks also were carried out by means ofPathfinder technique, but reports indicate that satisfactory results were achieved.Two hundred and thirty-seven Lancasters and seven Mosquitoes were despatched to attack the U-boat pens at Bergen. There was cloud over the targetand visibility was extremely poor. The majority of the crews were unable to seethe markers clearly, and although they made several runs they were compelledto abandon the mission. However, 45 Lancasters and seven Mosquitoes attacked the target, dropping 181 tons of bombs; assessment of results was impossible.The battleship Tirpitz, moored four miles west of Tromsb, was the object ofan attack by Lancasters with 12,000-lb. bombs. Forty aircraft were despatchedand 32 attacked, dropping 171 tons. The ship could be seen obliquely onapproach, but cloud interfered with the bombing run, and many aircraft madeseveral runs before bombing. In these conditions accurate bombing was difficult,but several near misses are claimed.A force of 24 Mosquitoes, escorted by eight Mustangs, made a low-levelattack in daylight on a Gestapo headquarters at Aarhus in Denmark. The attack was completely successful, as proved by photographs, and when the aircraft cameaway the buildings were wrecked and fires were burning in the shells of thebuildings.Small-scale attacks were made on other targets, including Berlin, Gutersloh(35 miles E. of Mtinster), Hamburg, Cuxhaven and Wesermlinde.In the battle area, three heavy daylight attacks were made by Halifaxes,Lancasters and Mosquitoes on gun positions and strong points in Walcheren;nearly 3,250 tons of bombs were dropped with satisfactory results. Attacks were also made by medium, light and fighter-bombers and fighters on roads, railways,bridges,&quot; supply dumps and shipping. Railways were cut in a large numberof places and many locomotives and trains, numerous road and railway vehicles and several bridges were destroyed or damaged. A 1,000-ton ship and a numberof barges were sunk.   In addition, full support was provided for Allied troops.. A. total of 1,594 sorties was flown by aircraft carrying supplies to theContinent.Offensive activity by the G.A.F. consisted of attacks by ground attackaircraft on tactical close support targets in the battle area between Aix-la-Chapelle and Nijmegen. During the hours of daylight these operations were carried out chiefly by Me. 262 jet-propelled aircraft in small formations of fiveto ten, although F.W. 190 fighter-bombers occasionally assisted. Thelatter aircraft, however, were more usually active at night when Ju. 87 aircraftalso operated. These night harassing attacks appear to have been carried outwhenever weather permitted by as many as 30 to 35 Ju. 87 and 15 to 20 F.W. 190,occasionally two or more attacks being made in the course of the same, night.note^Appendices VII, VIII and IX give Raid Assessments, operational and Air Sea Rescue statistics.Southern Europe.: 44. Adverse weather greatly restricted operations over the whole front.During the week ended dawn the 31st October, aircraft of M.A.A.F. flew atotal of 4,059 sorties (average over past 4 weeks 10,349 sorties) and dropped697 tons of bombs. Of the above sorties, 875 were by heavy bombers (2 missing).A total of 25 Allied aircraft is missing; no enemy aircraft was destroyed in combat.Heavy bombers made smalljattacks on railway centres in South Germany and austria, also against an aircraft factory in South Germany. On two occasionslarge numbers of escorted aircraft despatched to attack targets in yugoslavia and at Munich returned on account of bad weather.\ Restricted operations were carried out by aircraft of the Tactical Air force against communications and other targets in the Italian battle area.Gun positions and coastal batteries on Milo were bombed by medium bombers of Middle East Command.Italy.45. Communications were the principal targets. The Tactical Air Forceoperated On a restricted basis due to unfavourable weather.   Good results were
obtained against railway vehicles in the Battle area and Po- valley by fighter-bombers, and fighters, several guns were silenced, and railway lines cut. Therailway centres at Treviso, Vicenza and Parma were successfully machine-gunned.A large explosion was caused at a dump S.W. of Padua. A railway bridge atNovi (between Turin and Genoa) was bombed, with unobserved results.During the week approximately 100 locomotives, 330 railway wagons,and 150 M.T. were destroyed or damaged.Yugoslavia, Albania and Greece.46. Aircraft of the Balkan Air Force attacked enemy road and rail trans-port, shipping and troop concentrations. A small quantity of locomotives, rolling stock and M.T. was destroyed or damaged.A bridge north of Shegas (22 miles N. of Tirana) was hit. Casualties wereinflicted on troops between Vorre and Scutari; barracks were attacked on the road between Durazzo and Podgorica. Shipping off Sibenik and port installations atZara, Rah and Jablanac were other targets.The Coastal Air Force operated against shipping in the north Adriatic andM.T. in Albania. R.P. hits were obtained by Beaufighters on a pontoon south-west of Chioggia (15 miles S. of Venice) and two schooners were attacked off Umago.Small losses wer6 caused to M.T.On the 31st October, 174 Liberators were despatched to attack a militaryobjective in Yugoslavia, but returned on account of bad weather.Gun positions and coastal batteries on Milo were bombed on six days bysmall forces of medium bombers of Middle East Command. An ammunitiondump is believed to have been exploded.Austria and South Germany.47. U.S. heavy bombers attacked an aircraft factory and railway centre atKlagenfurt (Carinthia) (29 tons) and the railway centre at Innsbruck (14 tons).Munich West railway centre was attacked on two successive days. On the28th/29th, nine Fortresses dropped 14 tons, and on the 29th, 159 escortedLiberators were despatched, but due to adverse weather only 35 attacked,dropping 54 tons.
