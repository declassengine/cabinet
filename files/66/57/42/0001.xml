(44) 642.1   \\th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.GERMAN LEAFLET DROPPED FROM FLYING BOMB.Note by the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security.MY colleagues will, I think, be interested to see the enclosed Ministry ofHome Security memorandum about the German leaflet which was dropped froma flying bomb on the 5th November and the appended copy of the text of theleaflet.H. M.Home Office and Ministry of Home Security,Whitehall, S.W. 1,11th November, 1944.Copy No. 36German leaflet entitled &quot; The Other Side.&quot;German leaflets were reported, to have been dropped from a flying bombwhich fell in Sussex at 1945 hours on the 5th November. Only one copy has reached this Department, altihough a copy of the top half&apos;of the front pageappeared in the News Chronicle of the 7th November, and an alleged description,which does not correspond with the copy received here, appeared the same day in the Daily Mail.Attached is a copy of the text of the four-page quarto leaflet, which, also contains the following illustrations : On page 1, a picture of a flying bomb in flight with the caption : &apos;&apos; Soaringover the treetops, a flying bomb speeds on its deadly journey. It can be manufactured at a, hundredth of the cost of a four-engined bomber, and, ofcourse, there is no crew in it to perish when it comes to earth.&quot; A picture of aLancaster bomber in flight with the caption : &apos;&apos; This is the Lancaster bomber,one of the machines used by the R.A.F. in terror raids on Germany. Thousandshave been shot down.&quot;On page 2, a picture of a German miner heading a short item in the attachedcopy (see page 3). A picture of alleged British prisoners of war witih thecaption : &apos;&apos; Reunion in Arnheim Prisoners of war, survivors of the Britishdefeat. at Arnheim, give vent to their relief at having escaped. These twoambulance men were separated in the heat of the battle, and have met again,while waiting to be transported inland.&quot;Accompanying the article entitled &apos;&apos; What Exactly Is Hamburgising \ &apos;&apos;on page 3, are four illustrations, one showing a group of children sitting happilyin the grass, headed: &quot; These kiddies loved sunshine &quot;; a picture of a youngmother looking at her small son in his cot, both suitably fair-haired, with thecaption: &quot;He was his mother&apos;s pride and joy until Harris said &apos; wipe outHamburg &apos; then he and his mother became charred corpses! &quot; Below are twopictures, one showing charred corpses and the other a heap of bodies (the latter is taken from the earlier leaflet dropped from flying bombs in August). Thesetwo pictures have the caption : &quot; But when the R.A.F. came They got liquidphosphorus! &apos;&apos; and are related to the first picture.[28586] b
On the fourth page a picture appears of a man carrying a bundle and asmall boy on his shoulders with women walking in front down a street of ruinedhouses. This has the caption: &quot;Released from the cellars and tunnels into which the rebels had driven them, the people of Warsaw again see the lightof day. Their homes have been destroyed by the fighting, and they are dazedand exhausted as they tramp through the ruins. On the outskirts of the city,the&apos;Germans provide them with food and rest.&quot; The final picture is of threewomen looking at a long array of notices pinned up on a fence with the caption :&quot; The evacuees have pinned up their new addresses on fences and walls, soas to be able to get in touch with other members of their families again. even so, it is no easy matter.&quot; These last two pictures illustrate the article entitled&quot; The Tragic Fate of Warsaw.&quot;Ministry of Home Security, Intelligence Branch,7th November, 1944.THE OTHER SIDE.Berlin. Number 1.VI-Those &quot; Last Few Shots.&quot;Since May 1943 the R.A.F. have been hunting the hidden factories of hitler&apos;s secret weapons.But you at home were not told a word about it at the time.You were told remember? -that all this talk about secret weapons was just bluff, just German propaganda. It was only Goebbels trying to pep upNazi morale. Britain, you were told, had nothing to fear from any so-calledsecret weapon.Then V 1 came.We don&apos;t have to tell you of the destruction and casualties that it caused.You have been able to see them for yourselves.That was the first taste of what you&apos;ve got coming to you.Churchill had to come clean, at least to the extent that he then admitted thatthe R.A.F. had been secretly pounding away at the flying bombs&apos; starting-places for months past, while you were all in blissful ignorance.But the R.A.F. couldn&apos;t&apos;t stop V 1 coming.You have heard a lot about defensive measures taken against V 1. perhaps the people in the north of England believed all those fairy tales. Or perhaps not.You knew better, because the fly bombs kept coming over and landing in yourvicinity.They kept coming over -and you know with what results until your troopsoccupied the launching sites in France.Wrong A gain.Then your Governments spokesmen announced that a great victory had been achieved. V 1, according to them, had been conquered -there was nothing more to fear.Mr. Morrison declared: &quot;The time has come for open rejoicing&quot;;Mr. Duncan Sandys told you &quot; the battle against the flying bomb is over, wxcept perhaps for a few last shots.&quot; Those &quot; few last shots &quot; have now been comingover night after night. Why don&apos;t they stop ? Duncan Sandys, it now appears,was wrong.According to Mr. Sandys, V 1 had a range of 160 miles. How far distant isthe German front from London to-day? It looks as if Mr. Sandys was wrongonce again. V 1, you see, is a secret weapon.  And it has more than one secret.Mr. Duncan Sandys does not know what they are.Allied Air Offensive A Boomerang.Commenting a short time ago on the premature rejoicing in England at thesupposed end of the flying bombs, a German commentator remarked that the home of the R.A.F. could not expect to get off as lightly as all that.&quot; The Anglo-American air terror was spread over a long period,&quot; he pointed out, &apos;&apos; during which many thousands of German civilians suffered terribledeaths.&quot;
The German commentator went on to say that Germany had been forced toadopt this terrible means of replying to the R.A.F. attacks. Those who sought to bully Germany into submission^ he said, had to learn that their brutal methodsonly came back upon them like a boomerang.Count the Cost.How does a flying bomb compare with a four-engined aircraft of the oldtype, such as a Lancaster?   Here are some facts and figures : *A Lancaster bomber weighs roughly      ...       ... 16,000 tons.A Lancaster bomber costs ...      ...      ...       ...  60,000A flying bomb weighs roughly    .......       ... Half a tonA flying bomb costs ...      ...      ...      ...      ...  600For the price of one Lancaster Germany can sendover to England ...       ...       ...       ... 100 V 1These are equivalent in bomb-power to the loads of 300 LancastersA Lancaster carries a crew of    ...       ...       ... 7 menA flying bomb carries a crew of  ...      ...       ... 0Churchill  has  announced  that  R.A.F.   lossesalready amount to  ...      ......      ...       ... 50,000 menDuncan Sandys has revealed that losses in R.A.F.personnel in attacks on the V 1 factories,starting-places and on the fly bombs them-selves have been ...      .&quot;........ 2,900menCount the Cost!.The longer the war lasts, the more valuable become the lives of experiencedfliers.V 1 has not cost Germany the life of a single one of her pilots.Germany can stand a long war; Britain cannot. That is the essential factabout the present situation.The reason for it is twofold. For one thing, the Allies are forced to attemptto gain a quick decision because they know that Germany is in the process ofgaining technical superiority over her enemies by the mass production of weapons of a new and revolutionary kind.Exactly what form these new weapons will take Mr. Churchill can onlyguess. But that they will come he may be certain. V 1 is only a tiny foretasteof what German inventive genius has evolved. This progress in quality willmake itself felt in- all theatres of war -on land, at sea and in the air. And it willmore than make up for the numerical superiority that the Allies possess.Then Mr. Churchill must make haste for a second reason. This has to do with morale.The British nation is impatient to get the war over. It has no heart for along-drawn-out conflict yielding nothing but longer and longer casualty lists.That is why it must be constantly told that victory is in sight, that every battleis the last or, at any rate, the last but one.Until a short time ago, Britain was encouraged to believe that germany would be beaten in 1944. Then, after the annihilation of the air-borne divisionat Arnhem, Mr. Churchill had to prepare his country for another year of war.After all, he said, it would perhaps not be over until 1945.He dared not mention 1946, but no doubt he will come to that in due course.The German morale is made of stronger stuff, and the explanation is simple.You are fighting, not for yourselves or for your country as a whole, but for aruling clique which is anxious at all costs to retain its wealth and privileges.You are fighting for an antiquated system that can only bring you unemployment,poverty and social injustice.We, on the other hand, possess what you are always promised but never get.Our national socialist state is suited to the requirements of the modern age.It is for the masses, not for the few. We know what we are fighting for, andwe know that it is worth fighting for.- That is why we are in high spirits. Wecan take anything you can hand out, and pay it back with interest!Programme.The Other Side presents you with Germany&apos;s case why we are fighting this war, and what we are fighting against.  Our war aims are clear, but you have not[28586] B 2
had a chance to find out what they are. The other side of the war-picture forinstance, the seamy side of the Allied air war we bring you as well. But there&apos;sa bright side. You can learn, too, about your friends and relatives who areprisoners of war in Germany. News and pictures of them will be publishedregularly in The Other Side.Unknown Germans (1).50-year-old Felix Riibell is a miner of Beuthen, Upper Silesia, and he is aman who knows what Hitler&apos;s socialism means for the workers of Germany.&quot; I&apos;ve been on this job for 22 years now,&quot; he told our reporter, &quot; and I&apos;vehad my ups and downs. Now I draw my money as a hewer and, besides that, Iget my Miner&apos;s Service bonus, 500 marks a year. From this year onwards, as amatter of fact, it&apos;s double a steady 1,000 marks yearly, over and above my wages.that&apos;s worth having. After the war, me and the missus are going to buya people&apos;s car with the first thousand, and later we shall have our own house,which&apos;11 cost another three thousand.&quot;Rubell had four sons. Two have fallen, one in Russia and one in Africa.His third son is an electrical engineer, and the youngest is fighting with thePanzerjager near Aachen.Never before was so much done for the miners as now in Germany, saysRubell. that&apos;s why he&apos;s all-out for Hitler because through him the miners gotgood pay, good food and steady work, with enough comforts to make life worthliving.  He is confident Germany will win because she is fighting for social justice.A Job After the War?British prisoners of war in Germany have one big worry. They are worriedabout the future, about how they are going to earn a living after the war.In the prisoner-of-war camps many of the men are studying hard. Theyare doing their best to equip themselves for post-war life. They are learning tobecome fully qualified engineers, architects, chemists, accountants and agriculturalscientists. But behind all their industry there lurks a fear, a fear that isalternately spurring them on to greater efforts, or that is, in their own words,making them absolutely browned off. Is it going to be of any use ? they areasking themselves will there be jobs for us after the war1? Or will it be stillworse than the &apos;&apos; Land fit for Heroes &apos;&apos; that the men found waiting for them who came back from the last war ?Prospects Worse.Few think that the prospects are any brighter. Most think that they are far worse. Some say that the post-war struggle for jobs will be a bittercompetition, survival of the fittest, and they are grinding away, gatheringdiplomas and degrees but they doubt, too, whether these will help them.The forecasts made by experts in Britain about the expected tidal wave ofunemployment have given rise to the deepest anxiety among the Pows.They have watched the news of their country&apos;s decline in economic strength,of the loss of overseas markets and the strangulation of British trade, andthey are gravely troubled. They cannot see how Britain is ever going to get on her feet again. And they fear that demobilisation will mean for very many ofthem unavoidable enrolment in another army, the army of down-and-outs.They are asking themselves is this what we have been fighting for ?Can Britain Survive ?While in Germany many have learnt a lot about the National Socialisteconomic system, freed from the choking grip of world-wide usury, a system of natural growth of wealth, of maximum consumption and production, regulated forthe common good and not for the profit of a few.Europe can survive the war economically, they know but can Britain % Notif the Old Order still prevails. She will be broke, bankrupt and the sands of depression will sweep across her towns and industries. What wealth comes herway will be crumbs thrown her by her partner in war, rival in peace, theUnited States.These men, worrying and waiting behind the barbed wire of prison camps,are beginning to think that, as far as their own good is concerned, and the goodof their country, too, they have so far been fighting this war on the wrong side.
What E\xactly is &quot; Hamburgizing? &quot;It is the most highly developed form of air war against civilians.First, the roofs of the houses are shattered by means of high explosive bombs and mines. Then comes a carpet of fire-bombs. More explosives follow, tokeep the fire-fighters out of the way. These explosives also smash the watermains.   In this manner conflagrations are started.The great fire of Hamburg at the end of July 1943 caused the death of39,814 people, according to official figures, while 1,-571 are still missing. Mostlythey were women, children, invalids and old folks.They died in the cellars, asphyxiated or charred by the intense heat; or theyfainted in the streets and were set alight by flying sparks. Refugees were over-taken by the conflagration, and long lines of them perished. Mothers had theirkiddies snatched from their arms by the flames. Most of them suffered the samefate as their children.The Tragic Fate of Warsaw.You went to war to &apos;&apos; protect&apos;&apos; Poland. But what has Poland got out of it ?Her territory has twice been laid waste, and twice has her capital been destroyed-^without your being able to do anything about it! 3In 1939 Warsaw had a population of 1,200,000; in addition, some hundreds of thousands went to live there in the course of the war. This mass of humanity,which lived closely packed together on the banks of the Vistula, Was drawn intothe rising that was led by the partisans of General Bor. These people would have preferred to live in peace. Instead, they were forced to help in the guerrillaactivities against the German troops and against the Polish authorities who were responsible for keeping law and order.The partisans drove them into the cellars, where many died. The survivorshad to leave the city, which had been converted into a sea of flames.Civil War.So it came about that at least half a million of Warsaw&apos;s population lost their homes and practically all their wordly goods. The catastrophe of civil war hadtorn families asunder. Women and children were drowned in the canals orcrushed to death under the ruins.The signal for the rising of the 4th August came from Moscow as well as from london. But only a few planes dropped weapons and food, totally inadequatein quantity, while the Russians watched.the show from a safe distance: Moscowdesired the destruction of the Polish nationalists, desired the destruction of theBritish policy in Poland, in Order to get a hold on a leaderless people and to beable to transfer the pro-Soviet Government from Lublin to the capital.World War No. 3.The resistance of the Warsaw rebels has been broken. Their struggle wasthe overture to World War Number Three. It proved that Stalin would ratherallow the annihilation of a city and an army that was fighting for the Allied causethan budge one inch from his well-laid plans.And what is the object of these plans? It can be quite simply stated : the domination of Europe, without regard for the Allies or for any small nation.That is something of which Europe is becoming increasingly conscious !News from Germany.Reserves in Plenty.Germany has abundant reserves of all important raw materials for the finalstage of the war.  This is stated officially in Berlin.The reserves of iron ore, wolfram and bauxite are particularly plentiful, sothat the Reich is quite independent of imports. Our enemies will have reason to notice this in the coming months !A Bumper Harvest.. While in England the Minister of Agriculture has had to admit that theagricultural position is &quot;tragic,&quot; Germany has had an excellent harvest, andthanks to a well-organised food system, is certain to keep fighting: trim in the sixthyear of the war.
Westphalia, for example, reports especially good results. In spite of war-time difficulties and the terror bombing to which it has been subjected, this area has not only maintained its production but improved it in the past year.Convict as Mayor.A former Communist leader and jailbird named Behrens has been mademayor of the German town of Eupen, near Aachen. His appointment was one ofthe first acts of the commander of the American forces, on the occupation of thetown.Behrens was several times a convict before he fled to Belgium in 1933. Now,with Allied backing, he has returned to occupy this responsible position. TheGerman people are waiting for such men !One Power can save Europe!What country in the world has given most to humanity? Which land hascontributed most in the way of culture and scientific progress ? Sven Hedin, theveteran Swedish explorer and writer, is well-known as a friend of Germany, andtherefore it is not surprising that he thinks Germany has given most to the world.But he is surewof one thing more, that Germany will save Europe from herAsiatic and American enemies. Of this he is absolutely confident. &quot; The world&apos;s most marvellous inventions have originated in Germany,&quot; he says, &quot; and Germaninventive genius will save Europe in this hour of crisis. Brain and courage willtriumph over the numerical superiority of Russia and the material superiority ofthe Allies.  You mark my words ! &quot;Concrete Mines.A new type of German mine is now being laid in European coastal waters.It has a concrete casing, and is said to be a considerable advance on any yet used.Not only is it very cheap to manufacture, but it is likely to prove very expensivefor Germany&apos;s enemies.It is, though, only one item on a long list of new German weapons. And thisis the list for publication. Those on the secret list you will be hearing more aboutlater on.The V Puzzle.Clues, across : 1. He is your enemy, too. 7. V 1 is so fast, that it is hard to this. 8. Partly a beverage. 10. This is the beginning of a Germanvictory. 11. We hear that this is a rare commodity in England. 13. This isin Latin.   14. He wants all you&apos;ve got.Down : 1. In the case of the air war, he has been bit by V 1. 2. Moneybut no pence. 3. Men and material intended for Normandy very often finishup at the bottom of this. 4. V 1 contains this. 5. Britain has none at inter-Allied conferences. 6. At Tehran, Churchill practically did this before Stalin.9. First person singular. 10. Two reprisals with nothing in between.12. Warmongers must this, if England is to be saved.   13. That man.1		2	3     4 1			5		6n		7			IS		m	8	9	mm     ?  -i H			10			it		12 B		13			l    ! Em	14		!						V 1 is a puzzle for the British Government, and this puzzle is in the formof V 1. If you choose to regard the cross-word merely as an entertainment, nodoubt you will get some fun out of it. If you take it seriously you will get more than that you will find that it contains some very useful advice!
