PHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &quot;S GGVSRNTyTENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.   3gW.P. (44) 619.7th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.TENTH REPORT OF THE SHIPPING COMMITTEE.1. When our Ninth Report* was issued in June, it was expected that imports in the first half of 1944 would amount to some 12^ million tons, and in the firstnine months Of the year, to some 18f million tons. In the event, the limitations imposed by port capacity have proved to be less severe than was at one time feared.Imports amounting to 12-81 million tons have been brought in from January toJune, and a further 6 - 09 million tons from July to September, making a total of18-90 million tons for the nine months&apos; period. This has been achieved withoutany adverse effects on the discharge of U.S. military cargo in the UnitedKingdom. In the nine months&apos; period more than four million tons of such cargohave been brought into United Kingdom ports over and above the 19 million tonsof our own imports.2. The following table shows the departmental division of the imports from january to September and the probable effect on stocks at the end of the thirdquarter : 4Table I.Eood ...MaterialsMunitions, &amp;c.Total  ..January-September 1944 (000,000 tons).Imports.8-398-621-89Net Consumption.8-689-911-8918-9020-48StockChange.- -29-1-291-58Stocks, EndSept. 1944.7-3312-52Stocks, EndSept. 1943.6-7913-573. Imports of food have been higher, and net consumption less than had previously been expected. As a result stocks of food at end-September were.490,000 tons higher than was estimated in our last report. Imports of materialshave been less and net consumption considerably (770,000 tons) less than had previously been expected. Stocks of materials at end-September were therefore510,000 tons higher than was estimated in our last report.4. It now appears highly probable that imports in 1944 will exceed theprogramme figure of 25 million tons. Imports in the last quarter are expectedto amount to some 6 - 50 million tons, giving a total for the year of 25 - 40 million tons. Any estimate of the proportion of this total import accruing to the different departments must at this stage be tentative. The most probable figures are :Food, 11-11 million tons: Materials, 11-82 million tons: Munitions, &amp;c, 2-47million tons. If these expectations are realised the food import programme for1944 will have been exceeded by 260,000 tons, and the materials import programme by 170,000 tons.* W.P.

5. The following table shows what the stock position will be like at the endof the year if departmental imports are as has been assumed above : *Table II.January-December, 1944 (000.000 tons).Food  ...MaterialsMunitions. &amp;c.Imports.11 1111-822-47Net Consumption.11-4713-122-47StockChange,Jan.-Dec.- -36-1-30Stocks,End 1944.7-2612-51Stocks,End 1948.7-6213-81Total25-4027-06-1-666. In spite of the relatively favourable experience of the first nine months,consumption of imported food for the year as a whole is not likely to fall belowprevious estimates. This is due to the disappointing United Kingdom harvestwhich will reduce the proportion of consumption which can be met from home supplies. End-year stocks of food, though slightly down as compared with theprevious year, still promise to be comfortably high. They are, however, liableto be drawn upon to some extent hy S.H.A.E.F. to meet the requirements of thecivil population of liberated territories, although it is expected that our commit-ment to S.H.A.E.F. for these requirements will not be exhausted by the end of theyear and that an amount, at present estimated at 346,000 tons, will remain as a charge on our end-year stocks.7. Net consumption of materials during the year is expected to be as muchas 1,190,000 tons less than we estimated in our last Report. This, like the discrepancy of 770,000 tons for the first nine months, referred to in paragraph above, is niainly attributable to reductions in the consumption of steel as comparedwith-the programme, and to the fact that internal transport stringency hasimposed less severe restrictions on the home production of ore and steel than was originally anticipated. Thanks to these developments end-year stocks ofmaterials, though probably at a lower level than in any previous year since 1939,will not fall to the critically low level that had been feared. For the reasonsmentioned above, the steel position in particular is very much better than hadbeen anticipated.Signed on behalf of the Committee,HARCOURT JOHNSTONE,Chairman.Offices of the War Cabinet, S.
