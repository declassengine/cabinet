H. M. S.Air Ministry, 8th November, 1944.105Q CCOMMONWEALTH   CONFERENCE   ON   CIVIL   AVIATION,MONTREAL (OCTOBER 23rd-28th, 1944).Review of Results.Composition of the Conference.1. The Conference was between representatives of Great Britain, the self-governing Dominions, Southern Rhodesia, Newfoundland and India.   -2. It was a Conference of officials making recommendations to governments and, therefore, no binding decisions were reached.Appointment of Chairman and Setting-up of Sub-Committees.3. At the opening meeting on Monday, the J23rd October, Mr. H. J.Symington, Head of the Canadian Delegation he is President of Trans-CanadaAirlines was elected Chairman of the Conference. After each Delegation had made a general statement, Sub-Committees were appointed to consider specialsubjects: (1) International Policy; (2) (a) Commonwealth trunk routes and(b) military services; (3) technical questions; and (4) operation of Imperialroutes. A short summary of the outcome of the discussions on these subjectsfollows. -International Policy.4. It was agreed to recommend that at the Chicago Conference theCommonwealth countries should concentrate on trying to get agreement to the setting-up of an effective International Authority possessing adequate powers ofcontrol and regulation over both the economic and the technical aspects ofinternational civil aviation.[28557]
5.   Failing this, it was agreed to press for Regional Operators&apos; Conferencesunder the supervision of an inter-Governmental body with effective powers to -regulate frequencies and rates..6. If this, too, proved impossible of attainment and there was a reversion to bilateral bargaining, it was agreed that efforts should be made to securethe insertion in bilateral agreements of standard clauses (a) limiting each agree-ment to a fixed term, (b) committing the contracting parties to assist in establishing an International Authority as soon as practicable, (c) securing fullreciprocity between contracting parties, and (d) relating frequencies to trafficrequirements.7. The representatives of Australia and New Zealand announced their intention of proposing at Chicago not only that there should be an internationalregulatory body but also that there should be international ownership and operationof aircraft and equipment on main trunk routes. This is a political principle with them, but they will not be unduly disappointed if we withhold support for it.   No support was forthcoming at Montreal from the other Dominions.8. The Canadian representatives tabled a revised Draft of an international convention which, though, it provided for economic regulation of international air services, proposed that (i) there should be no international control duringthe period between the signing of the Convention and its ratification by theGovernments concerned, and (ii) when the Convention came into force therewould be little control of frequencies and, generally speaking, any Stateoperating on a given route should be allowed to keep the traffic which it hadbeen able to attract during the transitional period. These proposals were not acceptable to our representatives or to those of the other Dominions, becauseunder (i) the United States would get a flying start during the transitional period when they would have aircraft which other nations would lack and afterthe Convention came into force they would, under (ii), be able to retain the favourable position they would have built up.during the transitional period.9. The Canadians fully understood these objections but, as a matter of tactics in their dealings with the United States, decided to table their draftat Chicago. They were content that the other Dominions should table amend-ments to provide (i) that there should be international regulation during the transitional period; and (ii) that national quotas should be in proportion topassengers, mails and freight embarked in the different countries the principleagreed at the Empire Conference held in London. Indeed, they would be wellpleased if such amendments were adopted.10. More important, at the initiative of the British Delegation, the canadians agreed that, if there is to be an International Convention, there shouldbe bilateral agreements to cover the transitional period until the convention is ratified, and these should contain standard clauses on the lines of paragraph above. This will secure the substance, though not the form, of the amendmentsfor which we and the other Dominions were pressing.11. The Canadian Draft as originally tabled was not sufficiently compre-hensive. It dealt only with regular air transport services, but did not deal withother forms of air navigation private and charter flying. The British Delegationpersuaded the Canadians that any new Air Convention should embrace not onlyair transport but all aspects of civil aviation, including technical standards,registration procedure and law of the air, and should embody the essential features of the Paris Convention which had proved its value over the past25 years; and this was agreed by the Conference.Commonwealth trunk routes.12. The delegates agreed to aim at establishing scheduled air services onroutes connecting the various parts of the Commonwealth and Empire so as toprovide a complete system of Imperial communications. A provisional map ofmain trunk routes was worked out at the Conference on the basis of the United &apos;Kingdom route proposals. (A map showing these routes, but not indicating whichEmpire countries would operate them, will be published in a few days.)Military Services.13. It was agreed that in the special circumstances of the transitional period, it would be in the British Commonwealth interest that existing militaryair transport services should continue on a military basis as long as possible.
Provision should, if possible, be made for the carriage of civilians not only forwar purposes but also for other essential purposes. Government control of priorities should be maintained on as uniform a basis as possible. Serviceobjections were raised to any charging of fares on military aircraft but it was recognised that this was a matter for Government decision.14. The suggestion for an R.A..F. Transport Command service across the pacific was warmly welcomed by Australla&quot;&quot;aha New Zealand. Canada pressed for sectional operation by P.CAP. from Vancouver to Honolulu. Our Delegationoffered instead R.C.A.F. operation from Montreal to San Francisco and it was thought that this solution would satisfy Canada.Technical Questions.15. Australia and New Zealand stated their desire and intention to buyBritish aircraft, subject to suitable British types being available. The Canadiandelegates explained that Canada had decided to buy American D.C. 4s withMerlin engines only because of the temporary lack of suitable British types,and expressed the hope that first-class British aircraft would be availablein. 5 years&apos; time when the D.C. 4s would be obsolescent. The Canadiandelegation was; however, unwilling to subscribe to a recommendation in favour,other things being equal, of using Commonwealth types. There was no formalconclusion in favour of giving preference to British types. The discussion onthis point was ruled out of order as being a trade question not appropriate tothe present Conference.16. Views were exchanged on other technical questions, but in the short time available it was not possible to arrive at agreed conclusions on matters of detail. There was a consensus of opinion that international, or failing that,Commonwealth, agreement on standardisation was desirable.Operation of Imperial routes.17. The British Delegation suggested that a joint or combined Common-wealth Operation Organisation for Empire routes was to be preferred but thatin any event there should be some kind of non-executive Commonwealth air transport Council. Australia at first supported a single Commonwealth organisa-tion (if internationalisation failed), but subsequently refused to accept a jointorganisation for the operation of the United Kingdom-India-Australia-NewZealand route. This attitude was a surprise and disappointment and NewZealand is taking steps privately to intervene with Australian Ministers in thehope of getting it modified. Canada desired sectional operation and not amalga-mation or joint operation on Commonwealth routes in which she was interested.New Zealand favoured, a,..single,,Commonwealth, operating organisation shouldthe policy of internationalisation not be accepted. South Africa opposed a singleCommonwealth Corporation but suggested that there should be a CommonwealthCouncil to co-ordinate policy and practice. India favoured a series of jointCommonwealth operating organisations. Newfoundland supported the UnitedKingdom proposal.18.   Three Empire trunk routes were considered : (1) United Kingdom-India-Australia-New Zealand;(2) United Kingdom-Canada-New Zealand-Australia;(3) United Kingdom-South Africa.19. On (1) the eastbound route to^ Aiistrgilia all four countries concerned have rejected sectional^bperation as&quot;uneconomic and operationally unsound. Thatis something gained. There was no other definite recommendation, but, in thelight of the views exchanged, it seems that it may be possible to secure agreement on parallel operation by Commonwealth agencies throughout the route with some form of supervisory body on which the commonwealth countries concerned wouldbe represented.20. As for the second route i.e., the westbound route (United Kingdom-Canada-New Zealand-Australia) Canada is now prepared to collaborate in operating a British trans-Pacific route via Hawaii. She did want Trans-CanadaAirlines to operate the sector Vancouver-Honolulu alone. The Canadiandelegation agreed that the matter would have to be considered further by their government and the Conference recorded the conclusion that, in view of theimportance of the Pacific route to Commonwealth countries, alternative methods
of operating it should be further studied. A co-ordinating Committee repre-senting British Commonwealth territories interested in the route was also recommended. The Canadian delegation were at first opposed to joint arrange-ments&apos; for the North Atlantic on the ground that it was not a Commonwealthroute since it concerned only two Commonwealth countries, i.e., the UnitedKingdom and Canada. They finally said they were prepared to conclude a working arrangement with other operators for the North Atlantic.21. There remains trunk route (3) the route from the United kingdom to South Africa. The Union and Southern Rhodesia have decided to act in partnership for air operations in South Africa. While not ruling out thepossibility of a corporation for the operation of the main trunk route from theUnited Kingdom, they would prefer a joint partnership with the UnitedKingdom. The Union and Southern Rhodesia would provide an agreed propor-tion of aircraft and personnel. These and the United Kingdom aircraft operating on the route would operate for the whole route on a closely integratedservice. South of an agreed point, the Union and Southern Rhodesia would beresponsible for maintenance facilities and for care of passengers. The Conferencereaffirmed the principle of a British airline operating through to the Union.The details remain to be settled, probably at a Conference at Johannesburg, whichthe Union are anxious to hold.22. Finally, the Conference considered the proposal made by the SouthAfrican delegation that there should be a standing Commonwealth Air transport council to co-ordinate policy and practice. The Conference adopted thefollowing formula suggested by the British Delegation : &quot; On grounds of mutual need and advantage, and irrespective of the outcome of the forthcoming International Conference at Chicago, the presentCommonwealth Conference recommend the early creation of a permanentCommonwealth Air Transport Council with the following terms ofreference  &apos; To keep under review the progress of Commonwealth Air Com-munications and to consider and advise on such matters of common interest as appointing Governments may agree to refer to them; toserve as a clearing-house of information, and generally to dischargesuch functions as the appointing Governments may agree to require ofthem.&apos; &quot;23. The need for some standing machinery will be felt to an increasing extent by the Commonwealth, both in its internal and its external relationships.For its internal relationships, there is a clear need for an all-embracing Councilto co-ordinate the working of the Committees that are to be set up on the trunkroutes where Commonwealth countries will operate some form of partnershiparrangement. In the external field, startling developments must be expectedwhatever happens at Chicago. If an enlightened international settlement is secured, a wide range of complicated problems will arise in the devising of thenew international machinery, and it would be well for Commonwealth countries to take counsel together frequently in order to make their contribution fully effective. Conversely, if no international settlement comes out of Chicago, theEmpire countries will be faced with a difficult period when their well-placedcompetitors will be reaching out for traffic. They will need all the more to thinkand to act together not only for their own protection, but to bring about conditionsin which the nations of the world might try again and with better prospects ofsuccess to achieve a balanced and orderly system of air transport. Therecommendation for a Commonwealth Air Transport Council is probably the outstanding result of the Montreal Conference.Air Ministry, Qth November, 1944.
