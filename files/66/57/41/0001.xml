THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT168Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.W.P. (44) 641.10th November, 1944.SECRET.Copy No.WAR CABINET.NEW ZEALAND-AUSTRALIA CONFERENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.IN my paper W.P. (44) 630 I have circulated a series of telegrams from our High Commissioner in New Zealand reporting on the result of the recentNew Zealand-Australia Conference held at Wellington.The public statement made by the New Zealand Prime Minister at theconclusion of the Conference (the High Commissioner^ telegram No. 400)covered three main points : As regards (a) it is unfortunate that they have reverted to the proposal which we had definitely rejected that the new World Organisation should declarea principle of preserving &quot; territorial integrity and political independence ofmembers,&quot; but this is a matter on which we and the United States and Russiaare agreed and we are not likely to be embarrassed by this pronouncement froinNew Zealand and Australia.As regards (c), the very general statements contained in the public state-ment are unexceptionable in themselves and the form of statement is not likelyto give rise to any embarrassment to us, though it may be doubted whether this procedure on the. part of the two Governments will, in fact, help them in achieving their object.I think, however, that we ought to take the strongest objection to thedeclaration which they have made on the subject of Colonial administration(paragraph 3 of telegram No. 400). In the hope of facilitating discussion ofthis point I append* the draft of a possible telegram to the two Governments. i could amplify the points orally, if desired, when the War Cabinet are consider-ing this suggestion, but I might observe here that the two Governments describe the proposed international supervisory body as being analogous to the permanent mandates Commission. In fact, the Permanent Mandates Commission did not exercise such wide powers of supervision and inspection as are involved in thepresent proposal.In general, I think the time has come when we should speak frankly to thetwo Governments. We welcome the idea of regional discussion betweenAustralia and New Zealand and can have no desire to discourage it. But onthis occasion as on the last, they have issued without consultation with us or with the other Commonwealth Governments a declaration of policy on matters affecting us all. It seems to me essential that we should make clear to them the deplorable results which are likely to ensue if regional discussions lead to public declarations of policy on matters of interest to other members of theCommonwealth without prior consultation.(a) their views as to World Organisation;(b) their views as to future Colonial administration;(c) their views as to a policy of full employment.Dominions Office,10th November, 1944.* At Annex overleaf.[28580]
ANNEX.DRAFT  TELEGRAM  TO  AUSTRALIAN  AND  NEW  zealand governments.-; ; WE have learnt with considerable surprise and concern of the statement issued on behalf of the Australian and New Zealand Governments at the con-elusion of their recent Conference on the subject of Colonial administration inwhich they declare their support for the idea of an international supervisorybody with power to visit dependent territories and publish reports of its deliberations.As you will be aware from the discussion of this subject at the meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers in May this year, the United KingdomGovernment hold very strongly the view that such control by a central inter-national body would be most undesirable and that its establishment would be contrary to the interests both of the dependent peoples and of parent nations,and in particular of the British Empire. Indeed, we understood from what passed at the meeting on the 9th May, that Mr. Curtin shared our view (see minutesof 10th meeting, page 5). Recent proposals of this character have been ventilatedin the United States, and in view of this we were about to address to DominionGovernments a communication setting out our views in detail as to the futuresystem of securing international co-operation in relation to Colonial affairs ina form which we had hoped would be acceptable to Dominion Governments andalso to the United States Government. This matter is of vital importance tothe United Kingdom having regard to the immense extent of our Colonialresponsibilities. In our view in a matter of this kind all members of the BritishCommonwealth ought to take every care to co-ordinate as far as possible theirrespective views before entering on public declarations of policy. We can onlyexpress. our regret that this public announcement has been made on behalf ofthe Australian and New Zealand Governments without any prior consultationwith or warning to us. We fear that it may well lead to serious difficulty andembarrassment in our discussions with the United States Government and inthe future treatment of this question. In view of what has occurred we fear that it may become necessary for us to make some public statement indicatingour own attitude with regard to future policy towards Colonial territories. Thiswill necessarily imply, even if it does not directly state, our inability to acceptthe views put forward at the recent Australia-New Zealand Conference on thismatter.
