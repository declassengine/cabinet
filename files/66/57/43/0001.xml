THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (44) 643.15th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.FUTURE PROVISION FOR COLONIAL DEVELOPMENT and welfare.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. The next few years may well determine the future course of the colonial empire. The participation of the Colonies in the war and the gratitude felt bythis country for their efforts have increased our awareness of past deficiencies inour administration. Perhaps more than ever before the public to-day are interested in the Colonies and anxious for their development. On the other hand,hundreds of thousands of the natives of the Colonies, in one branch or another ofthe Armed Services, have been, enjoying a standard of living to which they havenever been accustomed before, have travelled thousands of miles from their nativevillages, and will return with a desire for some of the improved conditions whichthey have seen and experienced elsewhere.2. Realisation of these new conditions was given expression in 1940 by anew Colonial Development and Welfare Act, which provided for spending upto a maximum of  5 million a year for ten years on development and welfare, withan additional  500,000 a year for research. This Act, passed at the time of ourgravest danger, was a magnificent gesture, but I am afraid, for reasons outsideour control, it has remained little but a gesture. Shortages of technical staff, ofmaterials, and of man-power have largely prevented the translation of. thislegislative permission into reality. In fact, the estimated total of expenditureup to the end of the current financial year is only  3,790,000 against the 20 million which the Act would have permitted. Although this short-fall was due to no lack of sincerity or drive but entirely due to physical limitations, it has undoubtedly produced in many of the Colonies and even within the colonial service a cynical belief that the gesture was never meant to be more than a gesture.3. In these circumstances I believe the time has come when it is necessaryfor us to declare our intentions for the future. Since 1940 we have been ableto do a considerable amount of planning; and indeed things are now speedingup to such an extent, that in 1945-46 expenditure is expected to be at least 4 million.4. At my request Colonial Governments have been preparing outline plans of the developments which will be necessary to provide basic economic and social services -communications, water and irrigation schemes, health, education andso on on the minimum essential scale. I have received such outline plans froma number of Colonies, including several of the larger African territories, and, ofcourse, from the West Indies, where the Comptroller of Development and Welfarehas been working for over 3 years. I can, therefore, estimate much better thanin 1940 how much money will be required, after allowing, fully for what can befound from local resources of taxation and from public loans and making a realistic assessment of how much work local Public Works Departments canundertake and local supplies of labour can execute. As a single example I willquote an estimated minimum requirement in Nigeria of  27 million in 10 years.5. On the basis of the information in the preceding paragraph my proposals,which, in my judgment, represent the minimum needs of the Colonial Empire overthe next few years, if our frequently declared policies are to be implemented, areas follows:  . J(i) that the Act should be extended for a further ten years as from 1946;(ii) that the annual sum should be increased.   My proposal is that for the, three years 1946-47 to 1948-49 the provision should be  10 million per annum; for the next four years, 1949-50 to 1952-53,  15 million;[28589]
and for the last three, 1953-54 to 1955-56,  20 million.   These wouldbe over-all sums and would include provision for research and certain.        additional schemes such as higher education which I otherwise shouldhave had to bring forward outside the scope of the present Act.I have deliberately adopted the policy of increasing the annual figures as timegoes on. Experience has shown that planning and preparation for colonial development is bound to&quot; take time, that, as in rearmament, the actual expenditureincreases by stages, and that it is only in the later years that full provision is needed.6. I have discussed these proposals with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.He agrees that the Act should be extended for another ten-year period, and heagrees also that some, substantial increase in the financial provision is necessary.He finds himself, however, unable to commit himself to anything further thana provision for the ten-year period of  10 million a year for development and 1 million for research. As I understand it, he does not. base his alternative proposal on any criticism of my estimates of what the Colonial Empire willrequire but solely on the financial exigencies of this country. -7. I am afraid I am unable to accept the Chancellors proposal. He has,if I may say so, treated me with great fairness, and it is in full agreement withhim that I bring this matter to the War Cabinet. He feels, as I do, thatthe War Cabinet should have before them both the needs of the Colonial Empire,which I shall stress, and the difficulties of national finance, which he must emphasise.8. Although the differences in money between my proposals and the counter proposals of the Chancellor are small in comparison with the national finances, they are to my mind fundamental when applied to Colonial development.From the over-all plans which I have so far received from Colonies, I am convincedthat whereas under my proposal (with some pruning), it will be possible to under-take a practicable but far from extravagant scheme of development, with theChancellor&apos;s figures planned development over a period of ten years would beimpossible and in practice we should have to be content with a collection of individual projects instead of integrated plans, a practice which has been properlycriticised in the past and which cannot give the best returns from the money.I have had, too, some opportunities of judging the psychology of. Colonialpeoples and Colonial administrations, and I am convinced that anything short ofmy plan would fail to meet their natural expectations and aspirations.9. I am not pretending that the assistance to the Colonies which I proposewill not impose some burden upon this country. I do, however, feel that theColonial Empire means so much to us that we should be prepared to assume someburden for its future. If we are unable or unwilling to do so, are we justified inretaining, or shall we be able to retain, a Colonial Empire ? The burden, however,is infinitesimal compared to the gigantic sums in which we are and shall bedealing. Nor is the apparent burden wholly real. If these sums are wisely spent,and the plans devoted to. increasing the real productive power oi the Colonies,there will in the long run accrue considerable benefit to us, either in the formof increased exports to us of commodities which otherwise we should have toobtain from hard currency countries, or in the form of increased exports from theColonies as part of the sterling area to the hard currency countries outside.10. But I am not basing my argument on material gains to ourselves,important as I think these may be. My feeling is that in the years to come,without the Commonwealth and Empire, this country will play a small role in world affairs, and that here we have an opportunity which may never recur,at a cost which is not extravagant, of setting the Colonial Empire on lines ofdevelopment which will keep it in close and loyal contact with us. To say nowin 1945 that with these great stakes at issue we shall not be able to afford 15 million in 1949, or  20 million in 1953, is a confession of our nationalimpotence in the future. I take a less pessimistic view of oUr national future and it is for that reason that I ask the War Cabinet to approve the proposalswhich I put forward in paragraphColonial Office, -15tk November, 1944.
