7Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.169elSECRET.Copy No. 23 0W.P. (44) 639.11th November, 1944.war CABINET.HOUSING.STANDARDISATION, PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OEFITMENTS.Note by the Minister of Reconstruction.THE War Cabinet, at their meeting on the 25th September, invited the health Ministers to report on the possibility of standardising fitments for permanent houses and placing bulk orders for the necessary supplies (W.M. (44)126th Meeting, Minute 2, Conclusion (5)).The Housing Sub-Committee of the Reconstruction Committee have approved the proposals outlined in the attached memorandum.This is an outline scheme and the Departments concerned are now working out the administrative and legislative arrangements required for its operation.1. For the Government programme of prefabricated houses, all components and fitments will be ordered by the Government and their production will be planned and controlled by the Government.The permanent houses in the Government programme will, on the other hand,be built to the order of about 1,500 different local authorities; and orders for the materials, components and fitments required would in the ordinary course beplaced without any central direction or control. Some of the largest local author-ities would order direct from manufacturers, as would some of the large buildersworking on local authority contracts; but the great mass of builders engaged inthis programme would draw their requirements from the builders&apos; merchants.The problem is therefore to ensure that the materials, components andfitments required for the programme of permanent houses are (a) produced in&apos; time, in sufficient quantity and in proper balance; and (b) made available when and where required for that programme.This memorandum does not deal with the related problem of ensuring thatthese articles are obtainable at reasonable prices. That aspect of the matter isunder review by an official committee on Housing Costs, which was appointed bythe Housing Sub-Committee on the 2nd October.Standardisation.2.   The first need was to reduce the number of different types of component.On this the Ministry of Works have already made substantial progress, in(      co-operation with the British Standards Institution.  A handbook will shortly beissued giving, in abstract form, 140 standards already issued; and another70 standards, which are in an advanced state of preparation, should be issued bythe end of the year. This process of standardisation will greatly reduce thenumber of different types. Thus, there will be only 3 moulds for baths insteadof 40. Other examples are given in the Appendix.[28552]W.4, Richmond Terrace, London, S. W. 1,11th November, 1944.
3. .The&apos;Health Ministers will ensure that these standard components are used in the permanent house programme. They will be included in the specifica-tions issued to local authorities, and plans will not be approved unless they provide for their use.Similar arrangements will apply to any scheme for subsidising houses built by private enterprise and, so far as possible, to the repair or rebuilding of war-?damaged houses which attract cost of works payments from the War&apos; DamageCommission.Production.,4.   The Government programme provides for 200,000 temporary (prefabricated) houses,300,000 permanent houses built or building,&quot; in the first two years after the end of hostilities in Europe.&quot;If the production of components, &amp;c, is to be effectively planned, the wholeof this programme must now be related to a specific date. Delivery of thetemporary houses is planned to begin in April 1945; and the War Cabinet are nowbeing asked (W.P. (44) 633) to agree that building towards the first year&apos;s target of 100,000 permanent houses shall begin from the 1st April, 1945.A small number of permanent houses may be started, in areas whereimmobile labour is available, in the first three months of 1945; and the com-components, &amp;c, required for these can be drawn from existing stocks.5. The Ministry of Works have already calculated for each of the variouscomponents, &amp;c., the total quantities required for the, full programmer-temporary houses, permanent houses and essential renewals Ai\ each of the two half-yearsfollowing the end of hostilities in Europe.They will now estimate the quantities of each which should be produced,in each quarter of 1945 on the basis that the main housing programme will begin on the 1st April, 1945.6. The &quot;phased &quot; production of the total requirements must be planned,in relation to the continuing needs of war production, in consultation with the ministries of Production and Labour and the Departments concerned as&apos;&apos; production authority&apos;&apos; with each component. Application for the rawmaterials required will be made through the machinery of the Materials Com-mittee. Thereafter, the Ministry of Works will arrange that each productionauthority will discuss the total requirements for each component with theindustry or with an association which can speak for the industry, with a viewto framing definite programmes for specified numbers of the various types tobe manufactured by named firms. (No such detailed programme will be needed for components for which it is clear that ample production resources will beavailable.) When detailed programmes on these lines have been formulated,in terms of a stated output by particular firms by specified dates, the supply departments will be asked whether these firms can be released from their warcontracts to the extent necessary to enable them to carry out that programme.As a result of these discussions, with which the Ministry of Labour will be associated, a programme will be agreed upon which is consistent with the needsof war production.Arrangements will then be made for the selected firms to be released fromtheir war contracts in accordance with the arranged programme, and to beprovided with labour and raw materials, to the extent necessary to enable themto undertake this production for the housing programme.7. For all the components, &amp;c, required for the temporary houses, firmorders will be placed by the Government. For the permanent houses and forrenewals, on the other hand, though the total requirements will be known andwill be communicated tq the manufacturing industries and to the builders&apos;merchants&apos; organisation, there will be a timeTlag before this demand is reflected in the order-books of individual firms. Will these firms begin manufacturingfor stock and will the builders? merchants begin to carry stock, against thisprospect of orders to come \ Or is it necessary for the Government to take special steps to get production under weigh in this initial period of, say, six months before the normal flow of orders begins ?On the one hand, it may be argued that firms will be willing to begin pro-duction because they will know that there are heavy arrears of maintenance and
new construction to be overtaken and that for many years to come there willbe an ample market for their wares. On the other hand, it may be thought thatfirms engaged in war production have, during the last five years, becomeaccustomed to waiting for Government orders; that problems of storage maymake them reluctant to manufacture for stock; and that they may be unwilling to commit themselves in a market where prices., may be expected to fall ratherthan rise.8. Circumstances will probably differ between one industry and another,and between one component and another; and to this question no a priori answercan be given in advance which will apply in all cases. When the programme hasbeen settled, the Ministry of Works and the appropriate &apos;&apos; production authority must discuss with each industry and with the builders&apos; merchants what are theprospects that the required production will be secured within the prescribedperiods. Where this is necessary to ensure that production starts, the Ministryof Works should be authorised to arrange that bulk orders are given or produc-tion agreements made with the industries concerned for, say, the first six monthsof this initial period.The precise arrangements to be made in each case will be negotiated betweenthe Ministry of Works, the production authority and the industry. Thus, forcomponents common to the temporary and permanent house, the simplest coursemay be to increase substantially the size of the order placed by the Ministry ofWorks so that the surplus would be available to meet the early needs of thepermanent house programme. For components required for the permanent houses and not common to, the temporary house a separate order might have to be placed.The usual arrangement might be that a limited number of standardised types of each component would be ordered and local authorities, builders and builders&apos;merchants would be informed of the limited range available. The Governmentwould arrange that orders placed with the manufacturers by local authoritiesand builders&apos;&apos; merchants were regarded as part-fulfilment of the Governmentorder.Distribution.9. To ensure sufficient production, Government intervention will be neededonly in the initial period to plan the production and to stimulate manufacture in the early stages before there is a normal flow of orders. On the distributionside, there will be a napre lasting need for some central control to ensure that thedemands of builders all over the country are satisfactorily distributed amongmanufacturers in accordance with the agreed production programme. without some such control there will be a danger that the orders reaching individual firmsmay not be so distributed as to make the most efficient use of the availableproductive capacity, and that bottlenecks and delays in delivery will arise inconsequence.10. It will be for the production authorities to determine, in the light ofthe circumstances of each industry, how best to prevent such maldistributionof orders.In some cases control will be exercised from the manufacturers&apos; end. Thus,the Ministry of Works will arrange for manufacturers under their auspices toestablish special machinery for recording the flow of orders reaching individual firms and securing any redistribution required to make the best use of the totalmanufacturing capacity.In other cases it may be desirable to arrange that orders from contractors and local authorities shall pass through a central agency, which will distributethem among manufacturers. For this purpose use might be made of associationswhich can speak for the various industries.There may be some cases in which it will be necessary for the Governmentto place orders or to make production agreements, even though that was notrequired for the purpose of ensuring production, in order to prevent a mal-distribution of orders which could not be corrected by other means.11. The stocks held by builders&apos; merchants must also be distributed inaccordance with local needs. The Ministry of Works will therefore arrange for building Industry Distributors (which represents the bulk of the builders&apos;merchants) to set up a clearing-house to secure any necessary re-distribution ofthe stocks held by merchants. In the last resort, the Ministry will have powerto requisition excess stocks held in one part of the country and to transfer themto areas where there is shortage.   This power will provide the ultimate sanction
lying behind the operations of the clearing-house established by the builders&apos;merchants.There will also be power to control retail prices and to fix the profit margins of builders&apos; merehants.   .12. During the&apos;early stages of the programme, the amount of private workon maintenance or renewals will be kept within limits by a licensing system.This should secure that components, &amp;c, required for new construction and essential maintenance are not dissipated in less essential private work.4, Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1, - &apos;The following are further examples of the process of standardisationdescribed in paragraph 2 of the memorandum : llth November, 1944.APPENDIX.Standardisation of Components.Cisterns, Storage ...Hot Water TanksCopper TubesRainwater GuttersBaths6 sizes, 3 grades.One firm lists 80 moulds.40   moulds   exclusive   ofRecommended forMass Production.28 sizes and grades.6 sizes, 1 grade3 moulds.3 moulds.colour   variations   andSinks, fireclay     ...       ...   24 mouldsWash Basins      ...      ...   28 types.Windows, Metal ...       ...   250 types.Wood (Casements)   120 types.special features.24 moulds.28 types.250 types.4 moulds.4 types.59 types.29 types.J
