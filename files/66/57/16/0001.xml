This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmePrinted for the War Cabinet, November, 1944 rTOP secret.P. (44) 6168th November, 1944WAR CABINETUSE OF TEAR GAS IN PALESTINEMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR AND THESECRETARY  OF  STATE  FOR  THE  COLONIESLast April we circulated a Paper (W.P. (44) 209) to the War Cabinet askingapproval in principle to the use of tear gas by the police and military, under theauthority of the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, and in consultation with the HighCommissioner for Palestine, in the event of civil disorder occurring in that country.This Paper was considered by the War Cabinet on 24th April, but a decision wasdeferred, mainly on the ground that the use of any form of gas, even tear gas, by military personnel might be misrepresented. Some of our colleagues also, we believe,felt some doubt about the technical legal position in relation to the Geneva protocol of 1925.The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, has not ceased to urge that he should begiven authority to use tear gas to suppress civil disturbances. The opportunity of thePrime Ministers presence in the Mediterranean Theatre was taken last August to put the matter before him: and in reply to a minute from General Paget stating the case forusing &quot; tear smoke &quot;, both in Palestine and in Egypt, as a means of dispersing mobs,the Prime Minister expressed himself as personally in favour of the proposal, but thatthe matter would be considered by the War Cabinet.The deterioration of internal security in Palestine which we foreshadowed in ourPaper of last April is now evident. There has been a series of terrorist outrages inPalestine, such as attacks on police stations and the assassination of a police assistantsuperintendent and thefts of arms and equipment. The Government of Palestine are convinced that these outrages are planned and executed by a formidable organizationcommanding the services of a considerable force of well armed men. The dastardlycrime of which Lord Moyne has been the victim is unlikely to be without repercussions on the internal position in Palestine.We have had the legal position examined, and the general opinion is that this is aquestion of domestic and not international law. The 1925 Geneva Protocol does notforbid the employment of tear gas for police purposes, such employment not amountingto &quot; use in war &quot;; nor does it prohibit the manufacture of tear gas. If the use of teargas is legal for the police, it seems clear that it is equally legal for the military forces who may act in their support. We conclude that there is nothing in international agreements to which this country has subscribed which would prevent the use of tearsmoke by our troops in preserving law and order in Palestine.The Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, has now at his disposal a stock oflachrymatory grenades (K.S.K.), which is a liquid tear gas giving off vapour. Thedrawback to its use is that if by mischance the actual liquid gets splashed in the eyes,it may lead to loss of sight. The equipment used by the police in India and elsewhere,on the other hand, is of private United States manufacture and leads to no permanentinjury. A supply of this type of equipment is about to be shipped by the War Officedirect to the Middle East and should arrive in that theatre within the next few weeks.We now strongly recommend to the War Cabinet that the Commander-in-Chief,Middle East, should be given authority to use tear smoke in the suppression of civildisturbances in Palestine. As to its use in Egypt, the Foreign Office, we understand,are consulting the Cairo Embassy, and for the time being the question of using tearsmoke for similar purposes in Egypt must be held over. But in the circumstances nowexisting in Palestine, where at any time the internal security position may go frombad to worse and become a grave preoccupation, we think the hand of authority shouldbe strengthened in every way in dealing with crimes against public order. It is the considered opinion of General Paget that not only would he be able to deal more effectively with riot and disturbance if he can use tear smoke in their suppression, butthat its use for these purposes will be far more humane than more lethal weapons.O.
