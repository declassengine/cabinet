THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 648.WAR CABINET.WAR CRIMES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theLord Chancellor.IN the course of the discussion at the War Cabinet on the 4th October (WarCabinet Conclusions 131 (44) ) the view was expressed that the right way to dealwith those offenders who had committed war crimes against British subjects wasto set up military courts to try them in Germany. On the assumption that thisview would be finally accepted, we have been considering, in conjunction with theWar Office and the other Departments concerned, the steps which would benecessary to set up such courts and to lay before them the evidence necessary tosecure the conviction and punishment of the persons guilty of these offences.2. It is, however, important that at this stage His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould reach a considered decision on the question whether the method of trial ofwar criminals for crimes against British subjects shall be by military courts setup in the appropriate theatre of operations. Although the date on which thefirst of such trials will be held may still be some way off, from the decision as tothe kind of court to try these cases a conclusion can be reached as to theappropriate machinery for conducting preliminary enquiries of the &quot; criminalinvestigation &quot; variety. In the absence of such machinery it is unlikely that more than a handful of war criminals will be actually detected, apprehended and brought to justice, and the longer the setting up of such machinery is deferred,the more difficult its task will become.3. If it is decided that the trial of war crimes against British subjects is tobe by military courts, the task of preliminary investigation and actual collection ofevidence will naturally fall to the military authorities, who have not yet receivedany authoritative instructions to undertake this task. The establishment of themilitary courts themselves can be effected by a Royal Warrant and regulationsthereunder. With the assistance of the Attorney-General, the Treasury Solicitorand the Judge Advocate-General the necessary document is now in draft andalthough not finally settled, will no doubt be ready for issue well before the date at which it will be possible to put it into effect.4. The machinery for such a criminal investigation, which should in ourview be established very soon, is one which concerns the Allied governments. Onthe one hand the smaller Allied nations (e.g., the Norwegians, Dutch and belgians) are interested in the apprehension of war &quot;criminals who have committed crimes against their nationals, but it will often be difficult for them tocarry out the necessary criminal investigations without the assistance of theBritish and United States military authorities in their respective areas. Theyare already looking to the major belligerent governments to help them in thismatter. On the other hand, the chances are that wanted criminals, irrespective of the nationality of the persons against whom they have committed crimes, will,if they are caught at all, fall or have already fallen into the hands of the armed forces of one of the major belligerents.5. For these reasons we think that the proper course is for the combined chiefs of Staff in Washington to issue a&apos; directive to theatre commanders definingin general terms their responsibilities in this matter.   Such a directive has, in12570   [28606]Copy/No.J
fact, been drafted by the CCS. in Washington, and a copy of it, at the invitation of the Chiefs of Staff, has.been examined by the Foreign Office and other interested departments. As a result, certain amendments have been suggested and a draftof the directive^ as amended is attached as Appendix A to this paper. Para-graph 5 definitely declares that the apprehension and secure detention of knownor suspected war criminals and the perpetuation of the available proof concerningtheir offences are military interests of prime importance. Paragraph 6 recognises the inherent right of military commanders to try war crimes arising out of theoperation they are actually carrying on, but reserves for further instructions the trial of other war crimes (such as those committed at earlier stages of the warand those committed against prisoners of war in enemy hands). The object ofthis reservation is to prevent the premature trial of war criminals at a timewhen reprisals by the enemy might result, and is not intended to keep open thequestion as to the method of trial by national tribunals, though it may have thatresult. Paragraph 7 charges theatre commanders with the task of immediateinvestigation. On receiving this latter charge theatre commanders will be ina position to devise the appropriate machinery and to collect the necessary staff to carry it out. The task will be a heavy one, as it will involve not only activeinvestigations, examination of witnesses, &amp;c, in the field, but also much document-tary research in numerous scattered records already in the hands of the service authorities and S.H.A.E.F. The means of making use of this information havenot yet been fully developed owing to the lack of a definite directive to this end.6. As regards S.H.A.E.F., a recommendation has been made to the C.O.S.inviting them to suggest to the CCS. that the Supreme Allied Commander shouldbe instructed to set up at once a special organisation with the necessary staff,whose duty it would be to investigate forthwith suspected offences committed by enemy forces or enemy civilians against nationals of the United Nations,including prisoners of war, or in Allied territory, during the present war. Theestablishment of such an organisation was recommended by both of us in minutesto the Prime Minister of the 22nd September and the 3rd October and arises by implication out of paragraph 7 of the draft amended directive referred to above.We regard the establishment of this organisation and the allocation to it of sufficient staff as essential if a large number of suspected war criminals are notto escape detention and apprehension. Similar organisations will probably berequired at other supreme headquarters.7. It is unnecessary to deal in this paper with the details of the organisation which will be required by the Departments in the United Kingdom for dealingwith this matter. If the charge is given to the military authorities, it will be primarily a matter for consideration by the Secretary of State for War, so far asthe British military authorities are concerned, in consultation with the treasury solicitor, who is responsible for the British National Office. It would, however,be most helpful if whatever organisation is established is in a position to keep intouch with the military authorities of the Allied governments in -cases whereinformation which has reached the British organisation appears likely to be ofinterest to any particular Allied government or national office.8. The suggestions made in this paper are in our view the best method for establishing a simple and speedy organisation for the investigation of war crimesand tracking down offenders. The Allied governments who want to collectevidence about war crimes committed in. their territories or against their own nationals will be assisted by our proposals and the functions of the united nations War Crimes Commission will also be helped, since the national offices of the United Nations concerned will be able to transmit to and from theCommission particulars of any cases which are of interest to it more quickly than is possible at present.9.   We therefore propose that the War Cabinet should agree : (a) to confirm the statement made in. the course of the discussion at the WarCabinet on the 4th October that war crimes committed against Britishsubjects or in British territory should be dealt with by military courtsset up to try them in Germany (or wherever else is appropriate);(b) that the C.O.S. be invited(i) to send to the CCS. the amended directive attached as appendix A to this paper (authority being given to theCO-S. to agree such further amendments as they thinkdesirable), and
(ii)v to recommend strongly to the CCS, that, supreme Alliedcommanders be instructed to establish at once&apos; a suitableorganisation with an adequate staff qualified to investigate war crimes find track down offenders. It is important that Alliednational offices should have direct contact with such organisa-tions established at supreme headquarters wherever this isnecessary;(c) that the Secretary of State for War, in consultation with the treasury solicitor, be invited to consider and give effect to any measures required to carry out the above recommendations, particularly in so faras war crimes alleged to have been committed against British subjectsare concerned.- A. E.S.lAth November, 1944.APPENDIX &quot;A.&quot;Draft Instructions to Theatre Commanders regarding the Handling ofWar Crimes.I. Definitions.1. The term &quot; war crimes &quot; includes those violations of the laws and customsof war which constitute offences agaihst persons or property.2. -(a) Eor the purposes of this directive the following dates are established : The war in the Far East began the 7th July, 1937.The war between Germany and Czechoslovakia began the 1st September,1939.The war in Europe began the 1st September, 1939.(b) War crimes do not include, offences committed prior to the beginningdates set out in sub-paragraph (a) above.3. War crimes do not include acts committed by enemy authorities against their own nationals.4. Guilt may be either as principal or accessory. The taking of a consentingpart in the commission of a war crime is likewise punishable; as, for example,omission of a superior officer to prevent war crimes when he knows of, or is onnotice as to, their commission or contemplated commission and is in a positionto prevent them. Obedience to the orders of a superior officer will not prima faciebe regarded as a valid defence and should be disregarded if it seems clear thatthe accused knew or ought to have known that the act was contrary to the laws and customs of war.II. General Policy.5. The apprehension and secure detention of known or suspected war criminals, and the perpetuation of the available proof concerning their offences,are declared to be military interests of prime importance.6. Military commanders have the power to try and punish persons who have committed offences against the laws of war, including war crimes. However, indealing with war crimes commanders will be guided by the following policies :- -(a) Military commanders may, if in their judgment advisable, try war crimesimmediately if the offences involve the security or the successfulcarrying out of military operations or&apos; occupation under theirdirection.(b) Military commanders will not, pending further instructions, try any otherwar crimes. In such cases military comnjanders will forward evidenceof the war crimes as directed in paragraph 10 below.
Ill-Investigation of Alleged Offences and Perpetuation of Proof.7. Each theatre commander will cause an immediate investigation, as complete and thorough as circumstances permit, to be made of all reports of thecommission of war crimes within his theatre, irrespective of whether the allegedcrime was committed before or after Allied military operations or occupation in the theatre began.8. If the investigation discloses evidence that a war crime has been committed, a full record of all facts and of the available evidence will be made.In so far as practicable, the evidence will be taken and recorded in such formthat it will be admissible against the accused in the event of a trial,9. (a) Evidence recorded as provided in paragraph 9 above will be disposedof as follows : *(1) In the event the war crime was committed against United States or british nationals, two copies of the record will be forwarded by theUnited States or British commander in the theatre, as the case maybe, through normal military channels to the United States or BritishGovernment.(2) In all other cases, two copies of the record will be forwarded by the theatre commander directly to theUnited Nations Government againstwhose national or nationals the crime was committed, or to the FrenchProvisional Government, or to the Italian Government, in cases wherethe crime was committed against a French or Italian national.(&amp;) In the event of the immediate trial of a suspected war criminal before a military tribunal, as authorised in sub-paragraph 7 (a) above, two copies ofthe record of trial, in addition to the usual disposition made of records of trialsby military tribunals, will be forwarded in the same-manner as-indicated- in  sub-paragraph 9 (a) above with respect to records of investigation.IV. Apprehension and Detention of War Criminals.10. The apprehension and detention, to the fullest practical extent, aredirected of all persons in each theatre against whom there is a reasonablesuspicion that they have committed war crimes.11. The United Nations Commission for the Investigation of War Crimeshas been set up in London by the Governments concerned for the purpose of collecting lists of war criminals, recording the available supporting proof, and making recommendations as to the tribunals to try and tihe procedure for tryingwTar criminals. From time to time the supreme commander will be furnishedunder the authority of the Combined Chiefs of Staff with lists compiled by theCommission of persons suspected of having committed wTar crimes. The list will contain the names and, where no names are available, the descriptions of thesuspected persons. The description may relate either to a particular person orto a class of person, e.g., &quot; Gestapo at . . . &quot; Persons so designated may beapprehended and detained without requiring further proof. A full record of allfacts and of the available evidence in their cases will be made as hereinabovedirected. Where considered necessary by the theatre commander, he may ask for additional information regarding such persons.12. Persons taken into custody as war criminals need not, prior to the cessation of active hostilities, be segregated from all other prisoners of war or civilian internees. However, special steps will be taken to see that all such persons are clearly identified as suspected war criminals and that all pertinentinformation about them is made available to the authorities responsible for theirdetention or evacuation, so as to insure against their inadvertent release. special care will be taken to identify and keep records of all such persons at the time they are taken into custody or as soon thereafter as is reasonably possible. all relevant documents will accompany them if they are moved. Necessary actionwall also be taken to see that records of the whereabouts of persons apprehendedpurusant of this directive, including any changes in their custody and. detention,are promptly furnished to the national Government to which the record of investi-gation was forwarded under the provisions of sub-paragraph 9 (a) above.13. No person in custody as a suspected war criminal will be handed overto any Allied authorities for trial and punishment except by arrangements between the Governments concerned.
