THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MJIJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&apos; Printed for the War Cabinet.   November.1944.The ssreislatiora of this paper has been strmily limited.   It is issued for the personal&quot; me of top SECRET .    - Copy No. 2W.P. (44) 610.1st November, 1944.WAR CABINET.CHANNEL ISLANDS.Note by the Minister of Labour and National Service.I think my colleagues will be interested to see the attached letter which Ihave received during the last few days from the Channel Islands.2. I should inform my colleagues that the writer of the letter, in a coveringnote, asked that, as a precaution against reprisals, his identity should not berevealed.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,1st November, 1944.ANNEX.    .Copy of a Letter dated 8th October, 1944, to Mr. Bevin, written from theChannel Islands.^ ^ ^You will perhaps remember me as the chairman at a dinner given in yourhonour at the Merton Hotel during your last visit to Jersey.2. I am at present Minister of Labour, dealing with some 2,000 men andwomen whom we have been enabled to save from compulsory work for the Germans.To-morrow (the 9th October) I go to prison for a term of seven months, my crimebeing found in possession of a wireless set. I am only one of some hundreds whohave received similar punishment, but I am the only member of the SuperiorCouncil to be apprehended by that filthy organisation the Gestapo. However,they will never find the last set. Thank God we are still able to get the B.B.C.news every day. What we would do without it is beyond my comprehension.Our local daily is simply a German propaganda organ filled with ridiculous news of victories and stories of the marvels of German Kultur.3. The condition of the poorer section of the population is getting near the breaking point.4. We have no gas, no coal, sometimes one hundredweight of wood fuel per month. Medical supplies and anaesthetics are practically non-existent. There isno soap, no sugar, no tea or coffee. The meat ration is 4 oz. per head once a fortnight.   Potatoes, Jersey&apos;s principal product, is rationed at 5 lb. per week.[28509]
5. - What little there is of Black Market is unobtainable by any but thewealthiest. Here are some of the prices asked, and given, by those with thewherewithal : Pork or beef, 20s. to 25s. a lb.Butter, 405. to 60s. a lb.Flour, 5s. 6d. to 7s. 6d. a lb.Eggs, 2s. Qd. to 3s. each.Rabbits,  2 to  4 each.6. The German troops, under the very strictest discipline, have behavedwell, but, similarly to ourselves, they are half-starved and are robbing everythingthey can find. By the above you will realise that we are definitely anxious for thecoming winter.7. We have refrained up to date from appealing for help, feeling that inno way must we hinder the war plans of the British Government, but things are getting desperate, especially with that section of the community with whichI, as Minister of Labour, have to deal.8. What we require most desperately are medical supplies, soap and fats(soap is absolutely non-existent). I saw a piece of Lifebuoy soap sold last week for  3. We are all waiting anxiously for the day of release from our Islandprison, and especially for news of our friends and relatives on the mainland andin prisoner-of-war camps in Germany. Planes have dropped thousands of leafletsin German, presumably for propaganda amongst the, troops. We often ask whynot some giving us news in English from our own people ?9.&apos; I am sending you this letter by a friend who is escaping from the island in a small boat. I would have gone with him but I fear, because of my officialposition, that were I to leave the Germans would take reprisals on the population.So perforce I must stay and do my sentence. Please do not think we have hadour spirit broken. The glorious news of the last few months has put new courageand determination in all of us. But four and a half years of occupation hasdeprived us of most things that make life bearable and we daily pray for the endof these conditions.10. Please forgive me writing you. I thought that you should know from anofficial source how things are with us.11. Trusting that the day when we may see or hear from you is not fardistant.I remain,Yours sincerely,(Signed)
