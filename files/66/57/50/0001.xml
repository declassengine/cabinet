(44) 650.15th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.PROPOSED  EXCHANGE  OF  UNITED  STATES  PRISONERS  OFWAR WITH ISOLATED JAPANESE GARRISONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT will be remembered that the War Cabinet at its meeting on the 28th July,1944, considered a proposal which the United States Government wished to putforward for an exchange of some 25,000 Japanese soldiers, isolated in the CentralPacific area, against a corresponding number of Japanese-held United Statesprisoners of war and (if necessary to make up the numbers) civilian internees.The War Cabinet decided (War Cabinet Conclusions 98 (44)) that an attempt should be made to induce the United States Government to agree that their proposal should be expanded into a single allied one to exchange Japanesegarrisons in the Central and South-West Pacific against British, United Statesand Netherlands prisoners of war on an agreed equitable basis.2. The views of the United States Chiefs of Staff on these counter proposals are contained in the annexed letter from the United States Embassy to theForeign Office.3. It will be seen that the United States Chiefs of Staff give good reasons why the area should not be extended to the South-West Pacific. They have met,the War Cabinet&apos;s views by agreeing to include British and Netherlands prisonersof war, but they do not agree to repatriation on a proportionate basis. UnitedStates prisoners of war in the Far East are far fewer than British commonwealth and Netherlands prisoners and United States reluctance to agree to this isunderstandable.4. There would be advantage in accepting the amended United states proposal. The United States Government intend in any case to make it: if itsucceeds, British Commonwealth prisoners of war will benefit. If it fails, no harm is done and His Majesty&apos;s Government will be able to claim that they havemade either the same proposals as those of the United States for exchange ofprisoners of war from the Far East or parallel ones.5. If it is decided to accept, the reply could express the hope that anopportunity would be given His Majesty&apos;s Government to express views as to priority of the British prisoners of war to be included, in order to provide ifpossible for them to come mainly from the worst areas Burma and Siam.6. It will be seen that the State Department have asked for a reply by the16th November. The reply could add that the United Kingdom Government isconsulting the Dominions and the Government of India, but in the short time available they have not learnt their views. The reply, therefore, represents thoseof the United Kingdom only, and is subject to modification in the light of theexchange of views with the Governments of India and the Dominions.A EForeign Office, 15th November, 1944.[28610]
ANNEX,Mr. Warner to Mr. Roberts.(Top Secret.) United States Embassy,\,Grosvenor Square, W.l.Dear Roberts, 9th November, 1944.With further reference to your letter of 21st August, 1944 (No. K.W. 57/50),concerning the views of the British and Commonwealth Governments on theproposal of the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, for an exchange of japanese-held United States prisoners of war for isolated Japanese garrisons in the Central Pacific, the Department has instructed the Embassy to inform you that, in view of the new British proposals contained in your letter under reference, the matter was necessarily referred back by the Department to theJoint Chiefs of Staff.The Joint Chiefs of Staff have now informed the Department as follows :-- 1. From the military point of view, expansion of the proposal to includethe Japanese garrisons in the South-west Pacific area is not acceptable atthis time.(a) The number of Japanese troops which would be affected by such an expansion is approximately 138,000, including some of the bestJapanese field forces.(&amp;) The provision of shipping to handle such numbers of troops mightprobably seriously affect the support of prospective Allied operations.(c) The assembly and actual embarkation of so many troops would be difficult.(d) The Japanese Government would not care to &apos;&apos; lose face &apos;&apos; by admittingthe hopeless position of these troops, especially as their presencerequires large Allied forces to contain them.(e) Such an extensive expansion of the original scheme would probablydestroy the chances of acceptance of any scheme of this nature.2. The Joint Chiefs of Staff consider that the proposal to be made to theJapanese at this time should be limited in scope to the Japanese garrisonsmentioned in my letter of 14tJh June, 1944.3. In view of the statements made by the British Government, the JointChiefs of Staff indicate willingness that the proposal be amended by excludingall civilians from the groups to be repatriated by the Japanese Government, andby the inclusion among these groups of British and Netherlands prisoners ofwar without providing for any specific ratio according to nationality among the prisoners of war to be liberated.4. The Joint Chiefs of Staff stress the desirability that all possibility offurther delay be obviated. They have informed the Department that amongUnited States prisoners of war to be included in the exchange priority should be accorded the sick and wounded.5. The Joint Chiefs of Staff remain of the opinion that no publicity shouldbe given to the making of this proposal and that all decisions regarding furtherpublicity should be reserved.In view of the necessity of dealing with this matter promptly, the Depart-ment has informed the Embassy that it proposed to address the amended plan to the Japanese Government through the Swiss Government in a telegram to be despatched to the American Legation, at Bern one week after the receipt bythe Embassy of the Departments instruction set forth above. The department has requested the Embassy to obtain confirmation that the British Government isagreeable to the proposal as amended and so to inform the Department urgently.The Embassy has informed the Department by telegram that its instruction hasbeen received to-day.Sincerely yours,CARLOS J. WARNER.
