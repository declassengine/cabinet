THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.SECRET.05Copy No. t)W.P. (44) 605.29th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.REALLOCATION OF MAN-POWER BETWEEN CIVILIAN EMPLOY-MENTS DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD BETWEEN the defeat OF GERMANY AND THE DEFEAT OF JAPAN.I am in general agreement with the draft White Paper which the Minister ofLabour and National Service has circulated under cover of his memorandum .P. (44) 563, but I am apprehensive of the effects which the release proposals in paragraphs 16 and 29 of the White Paper will have on the work of myDepartment.2. When the Minister of Labour and National Service discussed the civilianrelease scheme with the Joint Consultative Committee, he drew attention to thedesirability of uniformity in the release arrangements, for industry and the armed Forces.3. Paragraph 16 of the White Paper provides that all persons belongingto what is termed Class K &apos;&apos; will be given permission, if they so desire, to leave their jobs and retire from industry immediately the war in Europe ends, irrespective-tive of the production on which they are engaged.&quot; The Class K includes(1) women (married or single) with household responsibilities and women wishing to join their husbands on release from the Forces; and (2) all women over 45.4. These provisions are, in fact, more favourable than those which apply to women in the Forces as laid down in the White Paper Cmd. 6548. Thus, nowoman is to be released from the Forces if her retention is considered necessary on military grounds, and only women of 50 years and over and married women are to be given priority of release from the Forces over all others.5. There may, therefore, be discontent in the W.A.A.F. and the otherwomen&apos;s Services at what may be regarded as discrimination in favour of civilianwomen. , /6. My chief concern, however, is that there should be no breakdown inessential services. If the large numbers of civilian women in Class K who areemployed by the Air Ministry leave as soon as the war in -Europe ends, muchimportant work at Air- Ministry Headquarters (for example, issue of pay and allowances to the R.A.F. and the W.A.A.F.) and other work essential to theoperation of the R.A.F. in the field (e.g., at Maintenance Command) would be seriously jeopardised. .7. The numbers of temporary women employees of the Air Ministry areas follows : Non-industrial Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air.Air Ministry Headquarters ...5,000 (out of a total staffof 15,000)7,000 (out of 11,000)OutstationsIndustrial  - ,Air. Ministry Headquarters and outstations    10,000 (out of 80,000)[28488]
8. The ending of the war with Germany will not lead to an immediate net reduction in the work on which these women are engaged. On the contrary,releases and transfers from the Forces and the reorganisation and redistribution of tbi3 R.A.F. in its reduced form will cause much additional work.9. I understand that the other two Service Departments are likely to be faced with similar problems, but the position of the Air Ministry is probablyexceptional for two reasons : (a) it is dependent largely on temporary civilian,clerks for the issue of pay and allowances to the R.A.F.; and (6) the maintenance and supply services for the R.A.F. in this country depend to a considerable,extent on civilian industrial employees.10. I should explain that, though the temporary women employees at AirMinistry Headquarters and in other Government Departments have not receiveddirections under an &quot;Essential Works Order, many have been induced to remainin their posts only by the fear that if they left they might be directed to returnto the posts they had left or be directed to less congenial employment. If, asproposed under paragraphs 16 and 29 of the White Paper, they ceased to be liable to direction, many of them would probably leave.11. I therefore ask my colleagues to approve that paragraphs 16 and 29of the White Paper should be amended to provide that (i) the minimum age for immediate release should be not 45 but 50;(ii) that while every endeavour will be made on the termination of theGerman war to release such women coming within Class K. as wishto be released, those who are engaged on work essential to thecontinuance of the war against Japan may have to be retained untilsuitable replacements can be provided.A.
