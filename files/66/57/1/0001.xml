THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  October 1944.VWSECRET.copy ^No.     d),       W.P. (44) 601.27 A October, 1944WAR CABINET.WOMAN ALLEGED TO BE A SNIPER.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.IN my memorandum (W.P. (44) 342), of which the War Cabinet took note attheir meeting on the 27th June (W.M.(44) pJlefelConclusions, Minute I explainedthat at the time no evidence had been received to substantiate the allegationthat Erna Heilmann was a sniper. If- such evidence should be received, I agreedthat the woman must be returned to France and tried by a military court. Inthe meantime she would be kept in prison, under the Royal Prerogative, as a civilian of enemy nationality.Nothing specific against Heilmann has come to light, and certainly no evidence that she sniped our troops. She is of no security interest, and I find it difficult to justify her continued detention in prison.I accordingly propose to authorise Heilmann&apos;s transfer from prison to intern-ment in the Isle of Man. M.I.5 see no reason why this course should not beadopted.H. M.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1,27th October, 1944.[28483]
