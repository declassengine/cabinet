(44) 604.31st October, 1944.WAR CABINET.ECONOMIC CONTROLS IN THE TRANSITION PERIOD.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.AT their meeting on the 22nd September the War Cabinet decided that aGovernment announcement on the continuance of economic controls in the transition period should be made simultaneously with the publication of theproposed White Paper on the reallocation. of man-power between civilian employ-men ts in that period (W.M. (44) 125th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. The Reconstruction Committee&apos;s Sub-Committee on Industrial Problemshave now considered the general question of the continuance of economic controlsduring the transition; and it is their unanimous&apos;view that a statement of Govern-ment policy on this subject should be made in the terms of the attached draft.3. As regards the method of making this announcement, all the ministers concerned are now agreed that it would be inexpedient to publish a White paper on this subject and that an oral statement in Parliament is to be preferred.As regards timing, Ministers are also agreed that this general statement on the Controls should precede the publication of the proposed4White Paper(W.P. (44) 563) on Reallocation of Man-Power between Civilian Employments.That White Paper could then be presented as a first instalment of the information about changes in the administration of the various controls which is foreshadowed in paragraph 7 of the attached draft.4. I therefore recommend that a statement in these terms should be madeat an early date, in reply to a Question in the House of Commons, so that theway may be clear for the subsequent publication of the White Paper annexed to W.P. (44) 563.W.4 Richmond, Terrace, S.W. 1,31st October, 1944.APPENDIX.Draft of Government Statement. *(To be made in reply to a Parliamentary Question.)Question.Whether the Government can make any statement on the extent to whicheconomic controls will be retained after the end of hostilities in Europe ?A answer.Yes, Sir.   This question is of such economic as well as political importance that I am glad to have this opportunity of putting the issues clearly to the House.As, however, the reply is long I will, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, andwith the leave of the House, make the statement at the end of Questions.[28496]
Statement.1. In war the Government has taken responsibility for the control ofindustrial production on so far-reaching a scale, and is itself the buyer of so large a proportion of our industrial output, that the sudden and complete ending of the present system of economic controls would be a dereliction of duty on thepart of the Government and would produce economic chaos in the country. Noresponsible body of opinion, either in industry or among the general public, asks for such an immediate ending of all economic control. The Government is,however, asked and rightly asked to give such indication as it can. of theprocess by which control will be relaxed as conditions allow.2. What are the facts ? When the war in Europe is over there will continueto be an overall shortage of labour : the supplies of some raw materials andof most finished goods will still be quite inadequate to meet an uncontrolleddemand. It is therefore necessary to decide which are the most important national objectives.   These can be stated as follows :  (a) We must make our full contribution to the war against Japan.(&amp;) The course of the war has destroyed or exhausted many of the things thatare needed by the general public as a part of their normal life houses,food, clothing, footwear and many other domestic necessities are all in short supply.   These needs must be met.(c) We must maintain a high level of food production at home.(d) We must expand our exports to a level at which we can pay for theessential food and raw materials that we need from overseas despite the loss of the foreign investments we have sacrificed, and the heavyexternal liabilities we have incurred, as part of our war effort. Wemust also take our share in supplying essential needs of liberated areas.(e) We must begin the process of making good the serious arrears of mainten-ance and re-equipment required to raise British industry to the highest. * level of efficiency.3. The controls that have had to be imposed, and progressively extendedsince the outbreak of war, over man-power, raw materials, industrial capacity,agriculture, food, transport, prices, and other aspects of economic life, nowconstitute an&quot; interlocking system in which the various controls support andsupplement one another. Each of the economic controls must therefore be judged,not only by reference to its own particular purpose, but also by the essential con-tribution which it makes towards the general objectives of national policy.4. There are two alternative courses of economic policy for the transition period. One is to maintain the broad framework of Government control. Theother is to allow money to do its normal job of determining the destination ofgoods : this would involve not only high prices but a complete abandonment ofany national priorities.The Government has encouraged great and widespread investment of money in Government securities; it has therefore set its face against any policy thatwould lead to avoidable inflation. The immediate removal of economic controlswould make an inflationary movement certain,5. The Government therefore intends to maintain the machinery of theeconomic controls for the following purposes : (a) The prosecution of the war against Japan.(b) The re-establishment of a decent standard of domestic comfort in thiscountry; and, in particular, rapid progress with the Government^housing programme.(c) The maintenance of a high level of food production at home.(d) The expansion of the export trade to a level at least 50 per cent, abovethe pre-war volume.(e) The essential re-equipment of British industry.(/) The maintenance of &quot; fair shares &quot; of the necessities of life so long asscarcity lasts.(g) The avoidance of inflation by stabilising prices and costs.6. The Government believes that the maintenance of economic controls forthese purposes will meet with the approval both of industry and of the public.But as labour, transport, foreign exchange and goods become less restricted insupply, the degree of Government control over economic life will be relaxed, and
by deliberate acts of policy and administration the Government will seek to hasten the time when the equation of supply and demand will enable control to berelinquished without risk either of inflation or of jeopardising the priorities ofnational need.7. The Government recognise that those engaged in industry, agricultureand commerce are anxious to know, as soon as possible and with precision, howsoon and in what ways the present administration of the various economic con-trols will be modified. The Government wish to meet this desire. They havealready put before Parliament, in the White Paper (Cmd. 6548) on Reallocationof Man-Power between the Armed Forces and Civilian Employments, their pro-posals for the release of man-power from the Forces in the period of transition from war to peace; and they intend shortly to set out in some detail, in anotherWhite Paper, the principles on*which they propose that man-power should bereallocated between civilian employments during the transition period. but until the war with Germany is-ended, * or its conclusion can be foretold with reasonable certainty, it is impossible to say with precision what capacity can be released from war production, or to know definitely how soon some of the shortages of raw materials and food-stuffs will be overtaken. At this stage, therefore,the Government cannot make any statement about the timing or detailedcharacter of the changes which will be made in the administration of the othercontrols during the transition period. The responsible Departments will, how-ever, maintain close touch with the industries and other interests directly affected,and will keep them informed, so far as possible, of likely changes in the situationand in the methods of administration of the controls. This information will begiven as far in advance and in as much detail as the march of events may allow.
