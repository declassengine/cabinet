THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET.W.P. (44) 633.9th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.PERMANENT HOUSES-COMMENCEMENT OF building programme.Memorandum by the Minister of Reconstruction.THE published target for the construction of permanent-type houses is&quot; 100,000 built or building by the end of the first year after the conclusion ofhostilities in Europe &apos;&apos; and a further 200,000 by the end of the second year.2. The time has come when the start of this programme should be related to a specific date, and not merely to the beginning of the first year after the endof hostilities in Europe.Local authorities must be authorised to obtain tenders, and arrangements must be put in hand for the production of the required quantities of materials,components and fitments, some months before the actual work of buildingcan begin.The temporary house programme is planned to begin early in 1945; and forthe other programme, equally, plans cannot now be advanced unless someassumption is made about the date for starting this &quot; first year&apos;s &quot; programme.3. I recommend that the Departments should be authorised to make their plans on the basis that this programme will begin on the 1st April, 1945. If, inthe event, our hopes of the European war being over by then are disappointed, thedevelopment of the programme could be curtailed.4. I also recommend that the existing ban on the building of permanent houses by local authorities should be removed as from the 1st January, 1945.Apart from a small programme.in Scotland, no such building is authorised atpresent. I am, however, advised that in some parts of the country a small amountof immobile labour might be available for this work (including the rebuilding ofsome of the houses totally destroyed by air-attack) in the early month of 1945;and I invite the War Cabinet to authorise the Minister of Production to suggestan allocation for this purpose, if he finds it possible to do so, in his proposalsfor the Government Building Programme for the first quarter of 1945. We could provide from existing stocks the materials, components and fitments requiredfor the very limited amount of building which could be undertaken before the1st April, 1945.W.Copy No.4 Richmond Terrace, S.W. 1,9th November, 1944.[28577]
