(44) 140th Conclusions, Item 9).The Report of a Mission, headed by the Director of Economics (Civil Affairs) at theWar Office, which recently investigated the food position in France, Belgium and holland, is also appended (at Annex &quot; B &quot;): this is the report referred to in the first paragraph of my minute to the Prime Minister.P. J. G.The War Office,dfth November, 1944.
ANNEX &quot;A&quot;PRIMS MINISTER.In accordance with your request I forward a report on the food position in France,Belgium and Holland drawn up by representatives of the Ministries of Food and Agri-culture, the Foreign Office and War Ornce sent over for the purpose. A summary is onpage ii.The report was necessarily based on impressions derived from discussions with various people who themselves, owing to lack of communications and the present stateof disorder in the countries concerned, had no full and definite information. The pictureit draws is therefore inevitably not clear cut and precise.Perhaps it may help it I set out the general principles on which the militaryauthorities have been given, and carry out, the responsibility of providing relief supplies in liberated countries, and give you my appreciation of the position in France, belgium and Holland respectively.The military authorities must ensure that the civil population in a liberated areareceives sufficient food lest disease and unrest should hamper military operations. Theymust themselves in the first phases arrange for supply, shipment, receipt and handing over to the local authorities, since if they did not do so the requisite priority lor procure-ment and the necessary shipping, port and transport facilities would not be forthcoming.But within the liberated country they work so far as possible through the indigenousGovernment, and gradually that Government, which from the outset is responsible forseeing that full use is made of all the resources of the country, is expected to take overfull responsibility.Working on those principles the Cabinet, as you will remember, after considerable discussion, authorized me, subject to certain conditions, in conjunction with the americans to estimate and have ready food for use in North-West Europe during theperiod of military responsibility.   It was estimated that close on 1,200,000 tons offoodstuff would, on certain assumptions, need to be imported into North-West Europefor a period of six months after liberation.   Of that total, procurement of some 577,000tons was allocated to the United Kingdom and the necessary stocks are in this country.It is for S.C.A.E.F. to call forward those stocks as they are required, as part of his military supplies, and to arrange with the indigenous Government for their distribution.Up to the present S.C.A.E.F. has called forward 120,000 tons of supplies from thiscountry and issued some 30,000 tons.   There would no doubt have been larger imports and issues had there not been lack of port and transport facilities.   All the ports are completely taken up with military supplies.   In deciding whether it is necessary to import supplies S.C.A.E.F. has to consider to what extent such imports will be at theexpense of his military needs and whether, on the other hand, without them the civilpopulation will suffer such hardship as might result in serious unrest.   The indigenousGovernment in the meantime, has the responsibility for seeing that the population makesfull use of local resources and for keeping S.C.A.E.F. in touch with the food situation.S.C.A.E.F. has with each of the French, Belgian and Dutch Governments a military mission, and it is through these that the Governments should ask S.C.A.E.F. for suchhelp as they need in meeting their immediate food requirements.   Until ports can beplaced definitely at the disposal of the civil authorities it probably serves no useful purpose for the Governments to try through other political and diplomatic channels toobtain additional immediate supplies of food; unless S.C.A.E.F. agrees to shippingbeing diverted for the purpose, allocates port space, helps with inland transport, theGovernment can achieve nothing.   It may be that at some time the British and Ameri-can Governments may decide that it is necessary to instruct S.C.A.E.F. to admit certain additional immediate imports on political grounds, even at the expense of militaryoperations, but clearly that would be a last resort.Turning now to the individual countries with which the Mission&apos;s report deals, mygeneral impression is as follows:  France.The general state of nutrition is better than anticipated. The health of the peoplehas not been endangered up to the present. But their standard of food gave no marginand the level of nutrition will have to be raised before long. Apart from fats and meatthere is sufficient food, and should continue to be, in France. The difficulty is distribu-tion. No rail, and very little road, transport is available to distribute stocks from thecountry to the towns. If port facilities were available for civil imports it would bebetter to devote such facilities to transport and raw materials than to food.The French authorities themselves at the centre know little of what is going on inFrance as a whole, and therefore have great difficulty in putting forward realistic plans.They are, in fact, in very close touch with S.C.A.E.F. through the Military Mission.In the provinces the French local authorities appear to be self-reliant and to be doing the best they can to ensure that the towns receive supplies from the countryside.
Belgium.The remarks as to the state of nutrition and health and the standard of food hithertoprevailing in France apply here too. As regards quantities of food, there appear to bein the country sufficient stocks of sugar, potatoes and possibly meat, but early in 19.45considerable imports of grain and fats would in any case be needed. But even ot thetood in the country the best use is not being made. It is not, as in the case ot France,so much a question of transport (the road and rail transport of Belgium has suffered lessthan that ot France), but oi the tact that the farmer, temporarily at least, is not puttingbis stocks on to the market. This is due to the facts that the efficient Quislings placedin charge of the food control machinery by the Germans have been replaced byinexperienced people; that uncertainty as to Governmental financial policy has madefarmers refrain from putting their products on the market, and the limit of withdrawalsfrom banks to 2,000 trancs a month has reduced the purchasing power which sustainedthe black market. The Government itself lacks initiative. If, by exercising thenecessary powers, it were able to make full use of the foodstuffs in the country, at anyrate for some months, there would be no question of starvation. Recent telegrams showthat S.H.A.E.F. are working closely in touch with the Government; that they think thefood situation less serious than in Holland or even France; and that what is needed isorganization by the Belgian Government. The latest telegram from Brussels says thatat a meeting between the Prime Minister and Ministers concerned it was agreed that thefood position could be regarded as comparatively stable. A committee of high officialswill meet daily to co-ordinate measures and a representative of S.H.A.E.F. will attendthese meetings.Holland.Our information here is even less than in regard to France and Belgium, but it isto be feared that the state of the people &apos;s health and nutrition is worse than that of theFrench and Belgians; that the food situation will be extremely bad; and that We shallhave to import very large quantities of food for 3^ millions of the Dutch population in western Holland, and if the Germans flood the areas there the conditions will be chaotic.The above paragraphs are confined to the immediate food position, but, apart fromthat, in all three countries the possibility of getting through the winter without serious trouble depends on whether the other aspects of economic life can be re-started. Evenill France and Belgium industry is at a standstill through lack of coal, raw material andtransport, and unless something is done to re-start the economic life the provision of foodalone will not avoid a serious situation.As regards action, my conclusion is that at present we can only work for immediateneeds through S.C.A.E.F. and the military authorities. If, during these critical opera-tional months, we introduce other authorities not responsible to S.C.A.E.F., we shallcause confusion and may irreparably damage his military effort. On the other hand,the Governments should be urged to make immediate plans with the United Kingdomand United States civil authorities for supplies of all kinds in excess of the disease andunrest standard, which can be introduced the moment that port facilities allow. At thesame time I think that we should, in conjunction with Washington, draw S.C.A.E.F.&apos;attention to the fact that there is political anxiety in all three countries about food andthe standard of living; that so long as military exigencies require it the governments must work through him and relief supplies must take their place in the military stream;but that we look to him to keep the American and British Governments in close touchwith the situation, to warn them if it is getting out of hand, and, as soon as the positionpermits, to allow the Governments port and other facilities which will enable them to handle their own requirements: if there is any help that he requires from the British and american Governments in dealing with these matters, he will, of course, let us knowwithout delay.(Intd.)

ANNEX &quot;B&quot;aREPORT ON THE STATE OF FOOD, AGRICULTURE AND NUTRITIONIN FRANCE, BELGIUM AND HOLLANDWar Office. )Ministry of Agriculture.Ministry of Food.Ministry of Food.Foreign Office and Ministryof   Economic   Warfare,Economic        AdvisoryBranch.War Office.Its instructions were to report fully on(a) the amount of food available in France, Belgium and Holland ;(b) the state of agriculture and numbers of livestock ;(c) the state of nutrition of the people.The Mission assembled on October 2nd, and left for France and Belgium on October 4th,returning to this country on October 17th. In view of the shortness of the time availableto us, we have had largely to rely on information supplied to us by the military authoritiesand the indigenous Government Departments, although every opportunity was taken ofvisiting both rural and urban areas in the North East of France and in Belgium. We weremoreover warned on arrival by both the military and local authorities that, in view of the short time which had elapsed since the liberation of these countries and of the general dislocation-tion and difficulty of communications which still existed, their figiires were in most casesbroad estimates rather than the result of exact and up-to-date information from the various parts of the countries concerned. Unfortunately we were not able ourselves to visit thesmall part of Holland already liberated.For convenience, we have divided our Report into three parts, of which Part I attempts to give the background and the broad picture of the situation ; Part II deals specially with thenutritional aspect ; and Part III attempts a more detailed analysis of the food, agricultural and livestock situation in France and Belgium. In view, however, of the smallness of theDutch territory already liberated and the rapidly changing state of affairs in the occupied territory, we have not felt able to give any detailed picture of Holland in this Part.A summary of our conclusions will be found in paragraph 8 of Part I on page 11.23rd October, 1944.PART IBACKGROUND AND GENERAL PICTURE1. Background.In attempting to examine any one part of the economic situation in North West Europetoday, it must constantly be borne in mind that the whole area is in a most abnormalcondition. All the ports are still either in military occupation, under German control, or in large part destroyed and no appreciable civilian imports can yet be made. Moreover, with military transport requirements, the destruction of bridges, the almost complete lack of rail and motor transport and the absence of the postal, telegraphic and telephonic services,communications practically do not exist and consequently, in France at least, there is no realcentral administration, but merely a Government in Paris whose members and senior officialsoccasionally visit other parts of the country in motor cars. In Paris and Brussels, if onewishes to establish contact, even with Government officials, it is quicker to go by car than toattempt to telephone.2. These facts are fundamental and have produced a situation of which the broadoutlines are the same in the different countries though the symptoms vary in each case. Tounderstand even the food situation it is essential to see the whole picture, which may besummarised as follows ; (a) Economic.Economic life is approaching a standstill. Industry has largely stopped owing to lackof transport, lack of fuel and rapidly approaching lack of raw materials. Public utilities,such as water and sewage are functioning, but the supply of gas and electricity is everywhereextremely restricted. Coal is in fact the basic need not only for industry or public utilitiesbut also for heating.   There is no heating in any of the big cities as winter approaches andThe Mission consisted of the following : Mr. R. T. Sto^fordProfessor J.A. Scott WatsonSir J. DrummondMr. P. G. H. Barter......Mr. J. W. Evans   .   ......Major D. Babington Smith
while great efforts are being made to ensure its provision, many will undoubtedly lack themeans of warmth for the next few months. However, the coal mines in France are atpresent only working 3 days a week owing to the lack of transport both to bring pit-props tothe mines and to move the coal, when mined, to factories and towns. In Belgium there hasalso been trouble among the miners and output has been further restricted from this cause.For the time being the main effort in all countries is concentrated on feeding the cities andall available transport facilities are being used for this purpose. A marked improvement,f however, has been effected in this respect since the early days of liberation and,, while it isstill on a hand to mouth basis, a minimum standard is being maintained in France, thoughthe situation in Belgium is still in the balance. But against this improvement in the food situation must be set the increasing deterioration in the industrial picture due to the lack ofcoal and of raw materials for those industries (such as textiles, rubber and chemicals) whichrely on imported raw materials, of which only two or three weeks&apos; supplies are available.(b) Psychological.There is a marked psychological state in the countries concerned. Their active partici-pation in the war ended four years ago and it is difficult for the people to realise thatliberation does not mean a return to past conditions but an increased dislocation andprivation without active participation in the military operations. Moreover, beforeliberation, increased output or decreased consumption in many cases was, or appeared to be,of direct assistance to the Germans and adjustment is difficult to a state of affairs whereco-operation with the authorities is the first need. In addition, the administrativeauthorities themselves are suffering from some loss of initiative due to the prolonged period during which they received orders from the Germans on all important questions and insensiblyacquired the habit of looking to others to give orders and take responsibility. The war isnearer in Belgium than in France, but in neither country is there a psychological waratmosphere such as exists in the United Kingdom.(c) Political.A certain political tension exists. It would be beyond our province to do more thanrecord the fact that neither in France nor in Belgium has the authority of the Governmentbeen fully established over the Resistance Forces. In addition, there is a considerable gulfbetween those Ministers and Officials who remained at home during the Occupation andthose who have recently returned from exile abroad.3. The area as a Whole.(a) Set against this background, a broad picture can be obtained of the food situation inthe whole area, subject to variation in detail for the different countries, but it is difficult atthis stage to attempt a precise comparison of detailed import requirements with the estimatesmade before liberation, for the following reasons : (i) At the time of our visit it was only five weeks since the greater part of the area hadbeen liberated and the exiled Governments had returned. Estimates preparedlocally before liberation were often deliberately falsified in order to mislead theGermans. Moreover, since liberation, owing to the difficulty of communication,accurate returns of the harvest and of the livestock -situation are not yet in thehands of the Government Departments concerned.(ii) In the earlier basic Civil Affairs plan (which did not allow for scorching by theretreating Germans), it was anticipated that the main military advance wouldbe through France and that Belgium and Holland would fall in without militaryoperations in those countries, or the dislocation consequent on such operations.As events have turned out, however, we have been faced with a situation inwhich France and Belgium have been liberated by a single, rapid advance, and holland is left to bear the brunt of the fighting and scorching. Moreover, owingto the destruction carried out by the Germans, there are no ports at present available for the import of civilian supplies and the area is at present compelledto exist on indigenous production, whether imports are needed or not. In fact,Civil Affairs supplies distributed to date amount only to about 50,000 tons.When, however, ports become available, the pressure, for an improved ration may become very strong.(iii) The extent to which the rations of the individual have been supplemented byunrationed goods, by supplies from relations in the country and by black marketpurchases make it extremely difficult to assess the proportion of total&apos; production which is reaching the urban areas.(&amp;) A broad survey of the whole area .shows that the outline of agricultural production is not materially altered from that existing before the war ani that, although consumptionwill tend to increase gradually up to. the pre-war level, overall indigenous production willalso recover, so that the ultimate import requirements of each country will probably not varygreatly from her corresponding requirement before the war.   During the period of occupation
there has been only a slight falling off in the production of cereals, potatoes and sugar.There nas been a more marked deterioration in both the quantity and quality of livestock,and consequently of dairy products. An attempt has been made to meet the resultingdeficiency of fats by converting a certain acreage from cereals to oil seeds, but these havebeen unpopular crops with the farmers and it is anticipated that there will be a strongtendency to revert to the cultivation of cereals as quickly as possible.(c) Nevertheless, it must be accepted that the population of these countries have existedon indigenous production (with the assistance of approximately 100,000 tons of grain importedper annum into Belgium from Germany) during the four years of occupation, without anyserious effect from the nutritional point of view, and it would seem at first sight as if therewere no reason why they should not continue to do so for a further limited period. account must, however, be taken of the fact that livestock has already deteriorated to a level beyond which it would be dangerous to go and that there is, therefore, an urgent need for the import of fats into these countries in order to stabilise the position in the first instance andsubsequently to start a restoration of the basic position.In this connection the importance of fertilisers must not be overlooked. Supplies havebeen either short or non-existent for two years, and the 1945 wheat harvest will be seriously affected by their absence if weather conditions are unfavourable. Imports by January wouldbe valuable for potatoes and sugar beet if they could be arranged. Their import, however,requires considerable port and transport capacity, and it would seem to be impossible to import any effective quantities in time. There is also a need of tractors for replacementpurposes, but this is probably not a first priority.It must further be remembered that these countries have been looking forward to some improvement both in quantity and variety of diet as an immediate result of liberation.This is likely to be a material factor in the situation from the point of view of theprevention of disease and unrest and the avoidance of interference in the military effort. Ithas already been found necessary in both countries to reduce the extraction rate for flour to85 per cent, in order to provide more palatable bread.Apart from the staple foodstuffs, we are impressed with the importance of importingcoffee. Although the nutritive value is small, the psychological effects of the distribution of even a small amount would be large in proportion to the tonnage involved.(d) The nutritional aspect of our observations is dealt with separately in Part II, whichmay, however, be summarised by saying that, while both in France and Belgium there was aperiod in late 1940 and early 1941 when the food supply available in the towns was sorestricted that the health of many people was affected, conditions have gradually improvedto such an extent that there is to-day no evidence of serious malnutrition due directly tothe war.In both countries the health of infants is good and children of school age are in a fairly satisfactory condition, although inclined to be underweight. There are grounds for a littleanxiety about the development of adolescents. In the main, however, the situation hasundoubted^ been saved during the past two years or more by the means found to supple-ment the meagre official rations with food from other sources.The margin of security against malnutrition which these additional supplies have provided appears to have been definitely narrower in Belgian than in French towns.Moreover, it is feared that in both instances it is tending to shrink under conditions so farprevailing in the respective countries since liberation.We have not been able to obtain reliable information of the state of nutrition in occupied Holland, but there are disturbing reports.4. We give in the following paragraphs a summarised account of the situation in each ofthe three countries concerned. A more detailed report on the state of nutrition is submitted in Part II, and on food supplies and the state of agriculture and livestock in Part III.5. France.(a) Before the war France, with the help of her African colonies, was basically self-supporting in foodstuffs; even metropolitan France was substantially self-sufficient in staplefoods with the exception of fats and oils. Her land resources were adequate and her peasantfarms, by American or British standards were very amply staffed. We see no reason tothink that she will be unable to re-attain, within a very few years, the pre-war level ofproduction.French agriculture has suffered no major calamity and is a going concern. The broadpicture is of farms slightly undermanned and rather seriously short of animal power; of farmers working with tools that are rather old, and often in poor repair ; of fields that, by comparison with their normal state, are only a little less well tilled but also less adequatelymanured; of smaller herds of less-well-nourished cattle. The total output of foodstuffs hasobviously fallen and, since the peasant and his family live very much as they have alwaysdone, the surplus available for city consumers, even if it could be efficiently distributed, is less. Matters would have been substantially worse but for favourable seasons in 1943 and 1944.
Present stocks of cereals and potatoes are but little below standard. Sugar supplies forthe coming year are endangered not so much by a decline in the beet crop as by seriousdoubts whether, through lack of coal and of transport, sufficient of the crop can be processedto meet human consumption needs. The livestock situation has deteriorated owing to over-slaughtering and because of the lack of grain and oil-seed residues for feeding. There hasalready been a substantial fall in outputs of meat, milk and fats and a further decline mustbe expected by reason of the smallness of the stocks of hay. Cultivation of oil-seeds has provided indigenous vegetable oil, but this gain is more that offset by the loss of butter.The needs of farmers, in order to make possible a revival of production are, in order of urgency, spare parts for farm implements, phosphatic fertilizers, fuel [for tractors and farmengines, and some replacement of farm implements and tractors.(b) Nevertheless, production as a whole is sufficient for the minimum needs of thepopulation. The nutritional condition of the rural population is thought to be satisfactory in all respects. That of the populations of the towns north of the Loire is more reassuringthan it was anticipated would be found. There are no obvious signs that disorders of healthattributable to food deficiencies are more common today than they were before the war.That they have not become more prevalent is due in large measure to the consumption of bread made from &quot; long-extraction &quot; flour and large quantities of vegetables.The people of the towns have been able by one means or another to supplement theirmeagre official rations with sufficient food to maintain themselves in a fairly good state ofhealth, but there is evidence that the energy content of the daily diet has not been adequatein all cases to meet requirements. The weight of adults is below the pre-war level, although many people have regained some of the weight they lost in the bad period in 1940-41.Children up to the age of 3 or 4 seem to be in good condition. Those of school age aregrowing reasonably well, but are often under weight for their age and height. The relatively high food requirements of adolescents are not being met to the same extent as are those ofother groups of the populations. Industrial workers have lost weight but not to a seriousextent. Their general health does not appear to have been impaired by the conditions underwhich they have been obliged to work during the past year or two.The information available about conditions in the towns of the South Marseilles, Nice,Lyons and Bordeaux is so fragmentary that it is impossible to express an opinion regardingthe nutritional state of their populations. One can derive little more than a vague impression that, whilst, until recently, there has been little seriously wrong, the precarious situation that now exists in respect to supplies of staple foods, particularly milk for babies and young children, raises doubts about the immediate future.(c) If distribution were normal, the only imports immediately required to provide areasonable minimum standard would be substantial quantities of fats (which could beprovided in the form of oil-seeds from the African colonies) and relatively small quantities of meat. The supply of sugar for the coming year is still in the balance. The importance of coffee, as a psychological factor, should not be forgotten.Distribution, however, is by no means normal. At present no ports are available for civilian imports and, though efforts are being made to remedy this situation, it may well beat least the end of the year before any port capable of receiving more than coastal craft canbe put at the disposal of the French. The collapse of the internal distribution system is due in the first place to the destruction of bridges on every railway line. Rail communication isslowly being re-established between Paris and the other main cities, but at present practically no food supplies can be carried by rail. Repairs are being carried out, but it will, for instance,be some time before any railway bridge across the Loire can be restored.. Even if the actualrailway lines were restored, the lack of coal and shortage of locomotives would be a major factor in the situation. Road transport is also reduced to the barest minimum owing to the lack of vehicles and the shortage of fuel and tyres. At present all serviceable motor trans-port is employed in feeding the large cities and the general shortage cannot be remedied untilthe military situation permits the provision of a considerable quantity of motor transport for civilian use, together with the necessary supplies of fuel and tyres.\d) The military authorities have decided that, apart from the South of France, thesituation does not permit them either to import civilian supplies through military ports or to allocate any adequate quantity of road transport. If conditions were to improve in thisrespect in the near future, even as regards small quantities of imports, the question would arise as to the commodities to be imported. If foodstuffs alone were in question, itwould be desirable to import a certain quantity of fats and lesser quantities of meat and milk for children. Nevertheless, in view of the port situation, we agree with the views expressed to us by the French Authorities and SHAEF that the primary need is rather for imports ofthe means of transport and of raw materials than for the import of foodstuffs. At the sametime it is clear that, so long as the military effort continues and distribution facilities are notrestored, the southern part of France, which is normally a deficiency area, must be fed by imports provided by the military authorities^(e) The foregoing refers to the immediate situation. On a longer view it would seem thatan increasing quantity of imports will be necessary. Even then, however, the main needswill be limited to fats, coffee, meat and fertilisers, some of which can be obtained from the
French colonies. For psychological reasons, indeed, it will be necessary to renew trade withthe Colonies as early as possible, since it is difficult for Frenchmen to understand why produce of their African Empire cannot immediately be made available to them. Imports of meat and fats will have a special importance if the present deterioration in livestock (as regardsboth quantity and quality) is to be checked and herds gradually built up to a reasonablelevel.6. Belgium.(a) Before the war Belgium was one of the least self-sufficient countries of Europe,producing (in terms of calories) only about half the food of her people. Indigenous productionof potatoes, sugar, fruit and vegetables was adequate or nearly so, but there were large annualimports of bread grain and of edible fats and oils. The country&apos;s production of milk, butter and meat practically covered requirements, but the output depended on the use as feedingstuffs of large quantities of imported grain and of oilcakes derived from imported seeds.The loss of the greater part of her food imports during the occupation could not be made good by any major change in the pattern of Belgium&apos;s farming. Practically all useful land was already intensively farmed, and the amount of ploughable grassland was very small.Some oilseed has been grown in the past two years, but the gap in supplies of human foodhas been met, so far as it has been met at all, by other means by diverting rye and barley,formerly used as fodder, to the flour mills, and by raising the rate of flour extraction from70 to 95 per cent. Some imports of bread grains were permitted by Germany. the diversion of so much fodder corn to human consumption, combined with the virtualdisappearance of milling offals and the loss of feeding-stuffs imports, has necessarily caused agreat scarcity of animal food.Belgian crop yields have not greatly diminished during the occupation. The farm labour supply has been fairly adequate and farm people have been well enough nourished to work at full capacity. By contrast with France, there is no critical shortage of work animals. the fields are clean, the crops well cared for, and farm operations are not seriously in arrear.The farmers&apos; only severe disability has been a shortage of both animal manure and chemicalfertiliser. It is this factor that chiefly accounts for the fall in yields. As in France, however,two successive good seasons have partly compensated for the loss of soil fertility, and thedecline in yields, on average, is not more than ten per cent. The natural expectation is thatwith an average season in 1945 the fall will be accentuated. The state of farm implementsand equipment, and the supply position in regard to new machines, spare parts, fertilisersand fuel seems to be much the same as in France. There is anxiety about shortage of certainseeds for spring sowing. -The livestock situation is substantially worse than in France not so much because thedepletion of Belgian herds has been more severe, but because supplies of feeding stuffs havebeen much less adequate. It is true that in October a good late season growth of pastureand forage crops had brought cattle into very fair condition after a very difficult winter andspring. But the outlook for the coming winter is poor; available feeding stuffs consist ofstraw, a poor stock of hay, a moderate supply of roots and a little beet pulp.The output of meat may probably decline still further, while the quality will alsodeteriorate. More serious will be the expected decline in milk yields, which will affect suppliesof both liquid milk and butter.(b) The rural population is as well nourished as it was in pre-war days. In the towns thereis evidence that some people have not been getting enough to eat. This is particularly trueamong the towns visited, of Brussels and Ghent, where many thin and drawn faces were seen.The special care taken of babies and very young children has been rewarded by their being in good condition. Older children are not in such good shape. They are underweightand their muscles lack the tone associated with good health. Adults of all classes areperceptibly thinner than they are in the French cities visited.On the other hand, there is no evidence that disorders of health due to the character ofthe food are more common than in the pre-war period. As in France, the nutritionalsituation was saved by the character of the bread and the vegetable supply, although thelatter does not appear to have been quite as plentiful as in French towns.The picture as a whole is one of town populations supplementing their official rationsfrom other sources of food supply, but to a smaller extent than in France. With a narrowermargin, the condition of the Belgians has tended slowly to deteriorate, whereas that of theFrench has remained relatively satisfactory.The deterioration has, however, been largely a consequence of calorie deficiency and would soon be made good if the energy value of the diet were increased.The industrial workers appear to be in reasonably good nutritional condition apart from some loss of weight caused by prolonged calorie insufficiency.The outlook is not reassuring. There appears to be a real danger that conditions arelikely to make it increasingly difficult to obtain food to supplement the official rations.Unless this food is made good by increases in the entitlements, there may be a substantial
reduction in the nutritional value of people&apos;s diet, already inadequate for their needs.Should that occur there will be a further Joss of weight and deterioration in condition, so thatthe people as a whole will be less fit to face the task of rebuilding industry.(c) The situation in regard to food stocks is shortly that supplies of sugar and potatoeswill be adequate or nearly so ; that indigenous meat production may barely suffice to main-tain the present ration of about 9 ounces per week; that the anticipated milk ouput,equivalent to about one third of British per capita consumption in peace time, will suffice togive a reasonable allowance to young children and other priority classes ; but that considerableimports of grain and fats will be needed to maintain even a very moderate standard of nutrition.id) While the foregoing paragraphs give the basic-position, certain deep-seated economic developments which came to a head during our visit to Brussels make it extremely difficultto see how the situation will in fact develop. At that time a serious threat to the food supply had developed as the result of the unwillingness of farmers to make their produceavailable to the urban population.   Their unwillingness was due to four causes : (i) The wartime collection system had been set up under the Germans.   Under anti-collaborationist pressure, the Government on its return formally abolished the organisation. After a short period, however, they found it necessary to restore the system although they did not re-instate the senior officials who understoodits workings. This left matters very much in the hands of the local collectorswho had not the confidence of the farmers.(ii) Owing to delays in the introduction of the currency reform which has recently beencarried through there was a leakage of information, from which the farmers,became aware of the main proposals and refused to part with their produce owingto distrust of the currency.(iii) Under the financial reform individuals are only permitted to draw 2,000 francs fromthe Bank during the present month. Consequently no-one is able to pay black market prices and the black market has disappeared overnight. As the suppliesformerly provided by farmers for the black market have not yet been forthcomingthrough the official channels, the urban population is living almost entirely onthe meagre official rations.(iv) Considerable uncertainty exists as to the future of agricultural prices.   It was clearthat the deflationary policy which had been carried out by the Government would necessitate a reduction of prices to the consumer. As, however, prices could notat this time be reduced to the agricultural producer, we understand that theGovernment contemplates the granting of subsidies for the main agricultural products. Their policy in this respect had, however, not been announced, andthere was consequently considerable anxiety as to the future of prices.As a result the supply of foodstuffs to the urban population was greatly reduced andthe public, which relied largely on the black market, could now only obtain the officialrations. At one time it was thought that serious trouble might develop amongst the minerswho were already abstaining from work on the grounds of inadequate food, and SHAEFwere arranging to bring forward minimum supplies of fats from the small reserve stocks which they hold for displaced persons. . However, at that moment the principal margarinefactory in Belgium was liberated and it was possible to make a minimum issue of fats fromthe stocks existing there, even before its normal production capacity could be resumed.When we left, however, it was still too early to say whether farmers would deliver freely upto the quotas allocated, or whether it would be necessary for the Government to take more stringent measures of collection. The Government itself was anxious that supplies of food should be imported and placed at their disposal in order to induce the farmers to deliver. The. military authorities, however, recently decided that none of the presently available portcapacity could be utilised for civilian supplies and it must be assumed, therefore, that noimported supplies will be available until the port of Antwerp has been cleared. Even then,the first civilian call on the port facilities must be for supplies for Holland [see para. 7 below).Transport for internal distribution, although difficult, does not present so serious a problem as in France.(e) In the normal course of events the consumption of indigenous and imported supplies would be co-ordinated over the year, so that at no time would the country be entirelydependent on imported supplies for all her requirements. In the present situation, however,it will be necessary for Belgium to live entirely on indigenous supplies for the next two orthree months, with the result that there will be a considerable period before the next harvestduring which she will have to rely wholly on imported supplies of deficiency commodities.There is in fact cause for some anxiety as to whether imported supplies will be available intime, in view of the claims of Holland to the first supplies to be brought in to Antwerp.The principal commodities concerned are grain and fats. In the case of grain it has.been estimated that indigenous supplies should last until the late spring even at the reducedextraction rate for flour of 85 per cent., unless it is necessary to raise the present breadration of 300 grammes to make up for the deficiency of other commodities, in which case it(19753) b,
10would not be safe to count upon indigenous supplies after February. During the occupationthe Gsrman authorities imported at least 100,000 tons of grain annually into Belgium and itseems probable that this figure will need to be considerably exceeded under presentconditions. The fats position is more difficult to access, since butter production normallyfalls heavily during the winter months, and considerable uncertainty exists as to what will beavailable. There will in any case be a serious shortage of fats by January. In the section on Belgium in Part III an attempt has been made to assess the import requirements in these commodities, but in view of the uncertainty of the situation, we would prefer not to commit ourselves to figures at this stage.It would clearly be undesirable entirely to exhaust the indigenous supplies of the deficiency commodities before any imports were made, and it is therefore of the greatest importance to import certain quantities of grain and fats at the earliest possible moment. Infact, although imports of raw materials are urgently needed in Belgium as well as in Prance,we consider that the first need in the case of Belgium is for the import of foodstuffs.(/) To sum up, the Belgian food situation is extremely uncertain and is by no meansfree from the risk of serious trouble. Everything depends on the ability of a not-too-popularGovernment to persuade the population to face the facts of the situation and to realize thatit is only by their own efforts, involving sacrifices by all sections of the community, that theposition can be tided over until the military situation permits of even a limited import of foodstuffs. The suggestion, sometimes heard among Belgians, that the Allies should take charge of the food situation would not, of course, provide a solution.7.   Holland.(a) Holland presents the most serious problem which has yet been encountered, though in view of the small part of the country hitherto liberated, it is extremely difficult to give any definite picture of the real situation. There is very little information on which to basean opinion on the nutritional condition of the town populations in the areas still occupied bythe German forces, but the reports of the appearance of the appearance of the people in thetown of the corridor liberated by the Allies suggest that they have been undernourished forsome time past to a considerably greater extent than people of the Belgian towns. reports from Nijmegenand Eindhoven are disturbing, but the malnourished appearance of the peoplethere is compatibl ewith what is known of food conditions that have existed in occupied Hollandfor the past six months or more. In the liberated area local supplies appear to beavailable for the time being, though on a very low scale ; but the existence of mihtaryoperations make it impossible to say how long they will last.(b) In the occupied area, North-East and South-East Holland are normally surplusproducers, while North-West and South-West Holland are deficient areas relying in part onthe surplus areas and in part on imports. For some time past the German attitude towardsHolland has been increasingly severe, and with the recent calling by the Allies of a railway strike in Holland- the Germans have practically cut off supplies from, the deficiency areas.Some damage has already been done in these areas by flooding and it is estimated that some500,000 acres are out of production from this cause, though the flooding is fresh j,waterflooding and the land can be brought into production again within a comparatively short period after it has been pumped dry. It is clear, therefore, that at best we shall have tomeet a serious situation in Western Holland, where liberation will find the population notonly without any stocks of food, but probably also in a state of semi-starvation. It must,however, be anticipated that a still more serious and even desperate situation may have tobe faced. If the Germans implement the preparations which they are known to have made and blow up the dykes at nine vital points, almost the entire area of Western Holland will beinundated with salt water, from which recovery would be a matter of years. This inundationwill mean that the whole of the rural population will be homeless and that in Amsterdamand Rotterdam parts of the cities will be flooded, the water supply will be seriously affected,sewage will cease to function and there will be no heating or lighting. In these circumstances it is anticipated that the population will follow the traditional road of escape to the duneson the sea coast.To deal with this major catastrophe it will be necessary to introduce emergencyoperations to provide the necessities of life for million destitute and largely homelesspeople. It is estimated that 2,000 tons of foodstuffs and 1,000 tons of other necessities willhave to be imported daily, apart from the provision of coal and, if possible, power. It is not for us to deal with the effect of this problem on military operations, except to say that if thesituation is to be dealt with at all, it will be necessary to import forthwith into Belgiumsufficient supplies to meet the immediate needs of Western Holland until direct shipmentscan be made. In this connection it should be pointed out that it is unlikely that Rotterdamwill be left in a condition in which it can be used for importing supplies, at least for aconsiderable period.It will be clear from the preceding paragraphs that the requirements of Holland will be considerably more than was anticipated, and may well more than absorb any surplus overprevious estimates of the food requirements of North-West Europe which might result fromthe diminished requirements of France for certain foodstuffs.
8. Summary.In the foregoing paragraphs we have endeavoured to outline the food and nutritionalsituation in North-West Europe as we found it. Our conclusions may be briefly summarisedas follows : (a) Detailed and accurate information about production and the livestock situation isnot yet available in the countries concerned. We suggest that there should be afurther examination of the position at a later date, say in about two months&apos;LllliC(b) The nutritional situation in France and Belgium is better than was anticipated.   Atthe moment, it is suffering from dislocation following on liberation, but provided this setback is temporary, we have received no evidence that the health of thepopulation as a whole is endangered. But the margin of safety is small (especiallyin Belgium). In any case the level of consumption will have to be raised, if it is desired to achieve a higher standard of industrial production than at presentprevails. Information with regard to Holland is meagre, but there are grounds for considerable anxiety.(c) The agricultural situation is on the whole not unsatisfactory, but livestock and con-sequently supplies of dairy produce and meat have deteriorated to some extent.The urgent need is to stop this deterioration and later to start to rebuild theposition.(d) The main factor in the immediate situation is that owing to the destruction of portsby the Germans and in view of military needs, practically no Civil Affairs supplies are being imported (except into Southern France). Such small imports as are possible are being stockpiled as a reserve against the needs of Holland and of Dis-placed Persons. The total quantity of imported supplies distributed up to datedoes not amount to more than 50,000 tons.(e) In France, the main problem is one of internal distribution owing to the breakdown of communications. The primary need of France is for the means of transport and raw materials, though a certain quantity of fats and, temporarily at least,milk for children and meat should be imported as early as possible. Theforegoing refers to the north and centre of France, but until internal communi-cations are restored, the South must rely largely on imported supplies.. (/) In Belgium, the situation is more serious. A partial producers strike at presentexists among the farmers and much depends on whether the Government, is ableto collect the requisite quantity of locally produced foodstuffs. Even if they are successful, indigenous supplies of grains and fats cannot last more than a fewmonths, and it is therefore imperative to import these items, as soon as the port of Antwerp becomes available. If they are not successful, a serious situation may develop at an early date. The transport problem is not quite so serious asin France, but the need for motor transport is nevertheless great.(g) Holland presents the most serious problem which has so far been encountered.   It isknown that the West of Holland has already suffered severely as a result of therestriction of supplies by the Germans. A large, quantity of supplies will therefore have to be imported immediately on liberation. If the Germans put into execution their preparation for flooding with sea water the greater part of WesternFlolland, we shall be faced with a disaster involving million people, which willnot only call for immediate action, but the consequences of which could only be repaired after a number of years.(h) As compared with earlier estimates of requirements it would seem that the Frenchneeds, except for fats, are less than was anticipated; those of Belgium may show no great variation ; but the requirements of Holland will be far greater than was expected and may more than absorb any savings in France.(/) We have taken as our basis the maintenance for some time of the existing levels offood consumption in the countries concerned. We must, however, point out thatthese levels are low as compared even with the present level in the U.K. and cannot safely be maintained indefinitely, especially if a high level of production isto be restored with the object of assisting in the war effort. Moreover, ifreasonable provision were not made for the other basic necessities of the indi-vidual man, namely, warmth, clothing and employment, we should have grave doubts whether the present food levels would be sufficient to prevent disease andunrest and consequent interference with the military effort. The situation in belgium must serve as a warning that it may not be possible to prevent rapid and unfavourable developments in the situation if these primary needs are not met. At the present moment they are not being met; there is considerable uncertainty as to the provision of warmth in the coming winter; and a seriousthreat to the provision both of clothing and employment owing to the lack of fuel and raw materials.(19753)
g. We would wish to place on record our appreciation of the great assistance andco-operation which we have received both from the French and Belgian officials whom wevisited, and from the various military authorities. Among the latter we would particularlyinclude the civil affairs staffs of Supreme Fleadquarters and the 21st Army Group, and theSHAEF Missions to France, Belgium and Flolland. We would also mention particularly the valuable helplgiven to us.by the Economic Advisers to the British Embassies at both paris and Brussels.PART  IITHE  STATE  OF  NUTRITIONi. Differentiation between Urban and Rural Populations.There is ample evidence that there is no problem so far as the nutrition of ruralfamilies in France and Belgium is concerned. The same is probably true of theagricultural population of Holland, except in those areas affected by recent militaryoperations or by serious flooding [see paragraph 7 below). Farmers are well able tosupply the needs of those dependent on them. This report deals, therefore, with the caseof urban populations who have no opportunities to produce food for themselves beyondthe cultivation of small plots of land when these are available.2. Scope of Enquiry.In addition to numerous discussions and conferences in Paris and Brussels, atwhich it was possible to obtain the views of officials of Government Departments andothers with expert knowledge of matters concerning nutrition in relation to public health,opportunities were found for gaining impressions about local conditions in other towns.Particular attention was paid to industrial and mining areas where it was anticipatedconditions might not be satisfactory. In these areas, we were given invaluable assistance by the staffs of the Civil Affairs Detachments. Enquiries were made on the spotregarding conditions in the following towns in Northern France and Belgium:St. Quentin, Cambrai, Lens, Lille, Liege, Ghent, Mons.3. The Problem.Under the conditions that have for four years determined the food supply of the towns of France, Belgium and the Netherlands, the question of the nutritional adequacy of the food becomes for all practical purposes a question of sufficiency or otherwise ofcalories.The enforced consumption of bread made from &quot; long-extraction &quot; flour andthe greater dependence upon vegetables of all kinds provide a wider margin of protection against the development of nutritional disorders than exists in normal times. against this benefit, there has to be set the more monotonous character - of the diet and itsrelative unpalatability, inevitable consequences of the lack of meat, fats and dairyproduce.There is one important reservation to be borne in mind in taking the broad viewthat the problem is essentially one of provision of the requisite calories. The needs ofexpectant and nursing mothers and young children, particularly for milk, must receivespecial attention.4. Calorie Levels.By classifying the population in groups according to their ages and their occupations and by taking into account the estimates of the average daily calorie requirements ofeach group, a figure can be derived, representing the per capita daily need for energyof the pipula.tion as a whole.For an urban population working at a relatively high level of industrial activity and under conditions similar to those in the United Kingdom to-day, that figure isfound to be between 2,500 and 2,600 calories per head per day. This is the dailyrequirement of the human machine and it corresponds, therefore, with the energy valueof the food actually eaten. Allowing for inevitable waste in the home but, at the sametime assuming careful use of food, this calorie provision should be met by purchasedsupplies representing from 2,800 to 2.900 calories per head daily. The same populationengaged in relatively sedentary occupations would require about 2,200 2,300 caloriesper head per day, corresponding with a food supply of about 2,400 2,500 calories.The calorie requirement varies not only with the degree of activity but with the body weight of the individual. One can make, therefore, an arbitrary allowance forthe low level of industrial activity in N.W. Europe and for body weights lower thanthose on which the accepted calorie standards of the National Research Council are based. On this arbitrary basis it is reasonable to assess the physiological requirement of the urban populations of France and Belgium to-day as being from 2,000 to 2,100calories, provided by food actually eaten and corresponding to about 2,200 to 2.300calories in terms of purchased supplies.
A supply of food that provides less than- 2,000 calories per head per day will not provide everybody with enough to eat even at this lower level of requirement. Somemust go hungry. If the full needs of active children are met, adults will not be able toeat enough to maintain their weight. Their loss of weight will be accentuated if they take more exercise or work harder. These facts cannot be ignored. The law of con-servation of energy applies as strictly to the working of man&apos;s body as it applies to the machines he operates.It is against the background these figures provide that we must set, on the onehand, information concerning the energy equivalence of the official rations and, on theother, data evaluating what the people are thought to consume.For a long time past, the official rations for the ordinary consumers in the three countries have not been sufficient to provide them with as much as 2,000 calories daily.The actual energy values of the rations fall within the range 1,300 1,600 calories per head.Had the consumption of food actually been at so low a level for two or three years,there would undoubtedly have been grave consequences. For several months afterthe upheaval in the summer of 1940, it was literally true that a large proportion of thepeople of the towns of France and Belgium lived at about this level of subsistence. Avery serious situation developed. Children ceased to grow; adults lost much weight losses of as much as 30 40 lbs. were common; nutritional disorders appeared, among them the most ominous of all the signs of semi-starvation, the condition known ashunger-cedema.It is possible to trace back to the deep impression made on the public mind atthat time many of the widely expressed views regarding the prevalence of &apos;&apos; starvationin the countries across the Channel.Had conditions remained as they were then, there would undoubtedly have beena catastrophe. As it was, the situation was gradually relieved by families findingmeans to acquire more food than they were entitled to get under the official rationingschemes and in free markets. This was particularly true in France and Belgium. in both countries, there was a rapid growth of well-organized black markets and, evenmore important, much enterprise was devoted to obtaining food from the country either by a system of regular postal parcels or by expeditions to buy produce from farms.Much as the use of such channels of supply is to be deplored as an alternative to equabledistribution of food, it must be recognized that it saved the situation in these two countries.Little was known of the magnitude of these developments or of the extent to whichthey had benefited the urban consumers until liberation came. It then transpired that,by the end of 1942, the people of the towns had recovered to a considerable extent fromthe nutritional crises that affected them during the winter of 1940-41, and it alsobecome clear that there was continued improvement during 1943-1944.It is obvious that local conditions determined what supplies of food reached theconsumer by illicit or unofficial channels. Paris, relatively favourably situated, seemsto have been particularly fortunate; by contrast, Brussels does not appear to havebeen so well served. It is an exceedingly difficult task to attempt to estimate by a direct approach what were the approximate quantities of food that reached the towns in this manner. On the other hand, an indirect approach gives us a useful clue. A populationobliged to live on food providing less than 2,000 calories per head per day could not fail to show after several months clear evidence of undernourishment. There would bedrawn faces, sunken cheeks and thin limbs to be seen in the streets, particularly amongmanual workers, children and adolescents. Judged by this arbitrary standard, it isclear that most of the towns of Northern France and Belgium we visited have been reasonably well served. Only in Brussels and to a lesser extent in Ghent has theappearance of the people indicated that many may have been living near or below thismarginal level. The scanty information about conditions in the Netherlands suggeststhat these symptoms of malnourishment are now more common there than in france or Belgium (see paragraph 7 below).It is true that workers, particularly those engaged in heavy manual work, havereceived additional rations of food, but the extra allowances they have had have been so small by comparison with what would be required to raise their consumption to thelevel demanded by the nature of the work, that the dependence of these people on supplementary food acquired &quot; off the ration &quot; has been as great, if not greater, thanthat of ordinary consumers.It must frankly be admitted that the appearance of the industrial workers causedsurprise. They looked much better nourished than had been expected. They haveobviously been successful to a surprising extent in supplementing their meagre rations.The conclusion that most of the town populations of France and Belgium have forsome time past been obtaining sufficient food from other sources than the official issues to bring their average per capita provision of energy up to or above 2,000 caloriessuggests that larger supplies are coming in from the country than it had been estimatedwould be available to the &quot; non-farm &quot; population. Calculations had indicated that thecalorie value of these in 1944 would be of the order of 1,900-2,000 per head per day ofthe non-farm population of the country as a whole.
The conclusion appears to be justified that prior to the recent disturbances affectingthe supply of food to French and Belgian towns their inhabitants were obtaining, bylegal or illegal methods, extra food representing additions of from 30-60 per cent. 10the official rations. It was inevitable, of course, under such a system that there wouldbe wide disparities between the extent to which the well-to-do benefited by comparisonwith the poorer people. But these disparities seem to have concerned the quality of thefood more than its quantity. The wealthy secured an unfair share of meat, butter, eggs and cheese; the poorer people bought less of these but made up to some extent withsuch foods as fat pork, rabbit and potatoes.It is obvious that the nutritional position must be precarious when people are obligedto live on food derived in part from inadequate rations and supplemented to an uncertainand varying extent from sources reached by devious means. Any circumstance causinga curtailment of the latter supplies will at once adversely affect individuals whose margin of security is so narrow. Even a comparatively small diversion of the flow of foodsthrough the unofficial channels of distribution might therefore have unfortunate reper-cussions. So long as nearly every family in the towns benefited by the black market, byparcels of food sent from the country and by purchases of food from farms in the vicinity of the town the system worked reasonably well. But its instability^ and the dangersinherent in it are at once apparent when any circumstance arises to disturb it. That is seen to-day in Brussels where the farmers&apos; fears regarding the new currency regulations as well as direct measures to restrict the activities of the black market have resulted inthe people being no longer able to obtain enough food to supplement their rations.There is no longer a stream of parcels bringing food from, the country to families in Paris.One consequence is that there is a tendency for people to lose weight again, after havingmaintained their weight, or to a small extent regained it during the past two years.Another example of the precarious balance of calorie provision under this system isprovided by the case of meals for factory workers. During the German occupation itwas by no means uncommon both in France and Belgium for the management of factories to buv food, in part in the black market, in order to give meals to their work-men. One gets the impression that this was often done less from a sense of social dutythan from a desire to retain employees and to get a higher rate of production than wouldhave been possible if the men had had only the food they were able themselves toprovide. There was also the argument, both practical and convenient, that to assist the black market was to hamper the Germans. It appears that the factory meals, consistingmainly of soups and large dishes of potatoes and vegetables, often added about 3-500calories a day to the men&apos;s daily intake; a significant even if an inadequate supplement to their other food.The incentives to this arrangement are to-day much less strong than they wereduring the enemy occupation. That, and the fact that black market supplies appear tobe less readilv obtained than formerly, makes it seem probable that in many factoriesthe meals will no longer be provided. At their low calorie levels it will be a serious matter for the workmen concerned to lose these calories.5. Nutrition in Relation to Health.The paragraphs [a-e) that follow give a general picture derived from a study of conditions in a number of the towns of Northern France and Belgium, including thoserepresentative of the mining areas of Lens and Mons. So little information of a trust-worthy character was available about the state of affairs in France south of the Loire andin the Netherlands outside the small corridor of liberated territory that an appreciation of the state of health in those two large areas cannot yet be made. It is thought,however, that a few comments on these two regions are justified. They are made in sections 6 and 7.(a) Needs of Infants and Children tip to School Age.In both France and Belgium, appropriate measures were taken soon after the Ger-man occupation to provide the special needs of expectant mothers and young children.Priority in respect to supplies of milk was granted and efforts have from time to time been made to supplement the milk with vitamin preparations of one type or another.This is particularly true of the larger Belgian towns.&apos; In spite of difficulties, magnifiedto serious proportions at the present time by the disorganization of transport, themeasures for giving babies a good start in life have been to a large extent successful.Generally speaking, the condition of children up to the age of 4 appears to be good. &apos;In spite of this, reports are current that the prevalence of deficiency conditions amongvery young children is giving rise to anxiety. The allegation that rickets is more widespread than it was before the war is the one most frequently encountered. these reports do not stand up well to critical examination. For example, it is stated thatX-ray examination revealed in IQ4.1 that 54 per cent, of a group of children in Marseillesshowed signs of rickets. From this, it is deduced that the war conditions have broughtabout a serious increase in the incidence of this disorder in that city; sometimes the
inference is extended to cover the whole of France. There are, however, many con-siderations that must be taken into account before a conclusion of so sweeping a characteris reached. The diagnosis of rickets by X-ray reveals the disorder in its mildest form.Unless, therefore, there are available data obtained by the same procedure before thewar, and there are not, it is quite impossible to use the figure of 54 per cent, for compara-tive purposes. Marseilles has at all times a large population of poorly nourished families.It would not be surprising to find among them in normal times a relatively high propor-tion of young children showing, on X-ray examination, symptoms of rickets, includingthe milder forms of the disease: on the other hand, a true increase may have taken place.There is no evidence one way or the other.There are grounds for suspecting that many of the reports of increased prevalence of nutritional disorders affecting infants and young children had their origin in the badtimes of 1940-41, when, it is true, there was cause for anxiety. During this enquiry no evidence of a trustworthy character was obtained that the health of children up to theage of 4 is in any respect less satisfactory than it was before the war. It is necessary,however, to make a reservation regarding the possible effect of the serious disruption oftransport which is making the provision of milk suitable for young children a verydifficult matter.Both in France and Belgium the authorities are fully aware of the importance of doing everything possible to maintain these essential supplies and it is to be hoped thattheir efforts to provide the necessary transport will be successful. If the shortage isonly a temporary one no great harm will ensue, but if it is prolonged it will be veryunfortunate.(b) Children of School Age and Adolescents.During the past two or three years, children of school age in Northern France andBelgium appear to have grown at a normal rate, so far as their stature is concerned,but there is evidence that a large proportion of them are not up to the weight theyshould be at their age and for their height. This fact tends to suggest that the majordefect of their diet is insufficient provision of energy, although it is possible that otherdeficiencies may be partly to blame. Bearing in mind the very large needs for energyof growing, active boys and girls they are comparable with those of fully grown menand women it is not unlikely that many of these children are not getting enough to eat.Without a more detailed investigation of their diets than it was possible to make it is notpossible to say whether other deficiencies are concerned to an important extent. Asuperficial examination suggests that calcium deficiency may be a factor, but the extentto which it may be responsible for their condition could not be determined withoutcareful study. A provision of milk for school children, to which such great importance is attached in the United Kingdom, forms part of the rationing systems in France andBelgium, but it is difficult to obtain clear indications of the extent to which it has beeneffective since the war. At the present time the distribution of milk presents suchformidable difficulties that even the provision of essential supplies for infants is not an easy matter.The addition of chalk to flour would, of course, dispel any fear that the develop-ment of children would be retarded by calcium deficiency.There is some evidence that the muscular tone of children is rather low. Therewas not an opportunity during this enquiry to investigate the matter carefully, buttrustworthy experts expressed the view that poor muscle tone was often found in examining schoolchildren of the poorer families. This condition was particularlynoticeable in Brussels and, to a somewhat lesser extent, in Ghent. In these two citiesthe children &apos;certainly looked in poorer shape than elsewhere. Their appearanceimmediately suggested that they were too thin. Their legs were spindly and their kneesbony. Calorie insufficiency alone would produce that condition. There was nowhere,among the towns visited, an abnormal amount of pallor in the faces of the children.Here, again, clinical investigation would be required to ascertain whether there is muchanaemia among them and if its incidence is appreciably higher than it was before thewar, but the superficial impression left after looking at the children in the.streets wasthat in this respect they were much in the same condition as were the children beforethe war.The years after puberty are a critical period in the development of young people and for that reason there are grounds for being anxious about the welfare of adolescentsliving under the conditions now prevailing in France and Belgium. It is true that, on paper, they are entitled in France to larger rations than those of the ordinary consumer,and that in Belgium there is a special allocation of separated milk (3 pints a week) for those between the ages of 14 and 18. To what extent these supplements are, in fact,available seems to be uncertain, particularly at the present time.There are no data regarding the weight of adolescents in the two countries. It isprobable that a large proportion of them are under weight for their age. Their generalhealth appears to be reasonably good.
i6(c) Adults.There are no clear indications that ill-health attributable directly to malnourishmentis more common to-day among the urban population of Northern France and Belgiumthan before the war. A great many men and women weigh less than they did in 1939,but the loss of flesh is not of such an order as to arouse anxiety. Only in Brussels andin Ghent was the impression created that adults, particularly the men, did not getenough to eat. In these towns there were many faces that looked drawn and pinched,more particularly among the poorer people. When loss of weight is related to calorieinsufficiency alone, and the condition is not complicated by deficiency of essentialnutrients, such as protein and vitamins, there is no cause for concern. Health will notbe adversely affected, although the capacity to perform physical work will be reduced.The lost weight will soon be regained when the calorie deficiency is made good.Vague statements about ill-health caused by lack of food are all too common. One,frequently encountered, is to the effect that anaemia is more common than it was a fewyears ago, especially among women. Very little factual evidence has been producedto show that this is so. Had there been a general and marked deterioration in the con-dition of the blood, there would have been much more data to bring forward than seemsto be available. The type of food being eaten to-day in France and Belgium should not give rise to anaemic conditions.Many people are undoubtedly living to-day in these countries on diets deficient bymodern standards in calcium. The deficiency may well be relatively greater than itwas in the years before the war, because milk and cheese are now much less readilyobtainable than they were then. Moreover, it is not&quot;unlikely that the use of bread made from &quot; long-extraction &quot; flours has tended to reduce the availability of the calcium inthe diet.Nevertheless, the only evidence advanced to show that people are being affected bythis deficiency is the claim that fragility of the bones of old people, due to rarefactionresulting from calcium loss, is commoner to-day than it was four years ago. Not allthe experts agree that this is true.Calcium deficiency is, fortunately, one that can be simply and effectively correctedby the addition of an appropriate quantity of chalk to flour, as is done in this country.Having regard to the important part that vegetables play in French and Belgiandiets to-day, it seems improbable that vitamin deficiencies are responsible for moreill-health to-day than before the war. On the contrary, it may well be that the positionis better than it was. There are, in fact, very few claims, and none of them carriesconviction, that vitamin shortage is a serious feature of the food situation as it affectsadults.(d) Factory Workers.There were no indications that industrial workers in the towns visited had sufferedto an appreciably greater extent than had other groups of the population as a result offood restrictions. This was contrary to expectation, having regard to the much largerlevels of calorie requirement for manual work (the ranges being from 2,500 3,500for women and from 3,000 4,500 for men, depending on the nature of their occupation).Even in the towns of the mining areas, such as Lens and Mons, there was no obvious sign that the men had been working for a long time on an intake of energymaterially smaller than that expended in their work.The conclusion, therefore, is that, consciously or otherwise, they had adjusted theirphysical effort to correspond approximately with the calorie value of their daily diet.As this was clearly insufficient to enable them to do a hard day&apos;s work, even after taking into account the energy equivalence of the additional rations to which they were entitledby reason of their occupation, it follows that their output must have been reduced as adirect result of the food conditions.No information was obtained to indicate the extent to which industrial output fellduring the German occupation, but there were so many factors contributing to bring this about that it is impossible to assess to what extent inadequate food might havebeen responsible.(e) Tuberculosis.This disease merits special attention because it is so often alleged to be much moreprevalent in France and Belgium than it was before the war, and it is said that this isdue to a large extent to food restrictions. Naturally, such statements have aroused muchconcern. The evidence is, in fact, very conflicting and it is doubtful whether the true position could be revealed unless an expert investigation of the data and of the presentsituation were made.No one would deny that malnutrition favours the spread of this malady. If a grimbui topical example were needed, it is provided by the deplorable condition of the menwho have been sent back to France, riddle with the disease, after being half-starved andover-worked in the forced labour camps in Germany.
Nor can it be doubted that the conditions that prevailed in many parts of Franceand Belgium during the bad times of 1940-41 caused a sharp rise in the number ofinfected persons and in the death rate from the disease.There appears to be little factual evidence to carry the argument beyond thesegeneralizations. The Institut National d&apos;Hygiene in Paris has produced a report whichit is claimed shows that the death rates for tuberculosis have increased very greatly incertain areas, over the period 1938-43. Thus, the rise in the rate in the Department 01the Bouches du Rhone is stated to be 74 per cent., and that in the Var 69 per cent.Both departments have large town populations. By contrast, the rates in the essentiallyagricultural departments of Cotes du Nord, Finistere, Loire Inferieure and Morbihanhave shown equally impressive reductions during the same period. It is unwise, when there are many other factors, particularly changes in the distribution of population, that should be taken into account, to infer from these figures that lack of proper nourishmentis largely responsible. On the other hand, the fact that the big increases are recorded in crowded urban areas remote from the main food-producing districts may be taken as circumstantial evidence that the food shortage has been an important contributoryfactor.Even the tuberculosis mortality figures for France as a whole do not give a clearerpicture. All that can be said is that the death rate is stated to be 11 per cent, higher in 1943 than it was in the five years 1933-1938. There are unfortunately no records for1939-1942. The death rate has not risen in the United Kingdom although there hasbeen a steady rise in the number of new cases, from 54,000 in 1939 to 62,000 in 1943,about 11 per cent.It is noteworthy that in nearly every country involved in the war there has beena rise in the figures reflecting the extent to which the population is affected by thisdisease. In some of these countries, in particular the United Kingdom, it is very unlikelythat the influence of food restrictions has been commensurate with that of such factors as the dispersal of sanatoria patients, long working hours in factories, over-crowdedhousing conditions, and those created by bombing attacks.An important fact that must be taken into account in appraising the French and belgian estimates of the prevalence of the disease is that certification by a doctor that apatient is suffering from tubercular infection gives entitlement to additional rations.A much more careful and critical study than has yet been made would be necessary before a clearer picture of the extent to which the gravity of the tuberculosis problem has increased since the war in France and Belgium can be obtained. Until such a study has been made, it is only confusing the issue to assume from the scanty and unsatisfactory data now available that the menace of tuberculosis is much greater to-daythan it was before the war, and that the character of the food supply is to a large extentresponsible.6. The South and South West of France.The serious breakdown of communication between the areas of France divided bythe Loire makes it impossible to obtain a clear picture of the nutritional condition ofthe people in the crowded urban areas on the Mediterranean coast and in Lyons andBordeaux. Even Government sources in Paris are unable to provide information.Reports from the areas are disturbingly conflicting. For example, two American officersattached to S.H.A.E.F., who had recently returned from the Marseilles district, gave areassuring account of the food situation and the public health. They admitted that therewere still difficulties in regard to providing grain and flour for the bread ration, which,however, according to their report, v/as about to be raised to the same level, 350-g. aday, as in Paris, and that the procurement and distribution of milk for babies and young children was far from satisfactory. But they both thought these matters werebeing dealt with as well as circumstances permitted and that the situation would soon be improved.In their view, the people in the Marseilles area looked well and not thin and under-fed. Vegetables and fruits were plentiful and were being consumed in large amounts.It is reassuring if these foods are available for all because it dispels fears of grossnutritional deficiencies. The lack of calories, which doubtless prevails, will, of itself,produce no ill effects other than loss of weight.Contrasting with this rather optimistic report is one received just before leavingParis, from the Director of the Institut National d&apos;Hygiene (Ministry of Public Health)in Paris. He informed us that he had just had Word from a colleague of his inMarseilles that the nutritional position there had deteriorated rather seriously during thepast five or six weeks and that it was giving the public health authorities cause for anxiety. Unfortunately, the Director was unable to provide any details of what wasamiss. It must be borne in mind that as long as serious transport difficulties remain,large Mediterranean coastal towns must be regarded as in a precarious situation withrespect to staple foods.We were unable to obtain any information about conditions in Lyons and Bordeaux.(19753) c
i87. The Special Case of the Netherlands.-There is little trustworthy information about the state of health of the Netherlandspopulation prior to the Allied invasion of their territory. It is known that the rationing system, including the scheme for providing milk for expectant mothers and children,was operated with greater efficiency and was subject to less abuse than the system in either France or Belgium. In one respect, this may have been to the disadvantage ofthe people in the towns because it restricted their opportunities to supplement their rationswith food from other sources. The official rations provided the ordinary consumer with no more than 1,500 calories daily and were, therefore, quite inadequate for his needs.The general picture, in consequence, reflects not only a greater calorie deficit thanprevailed in France and Belgium, where so much &quot; off the ration &quot; food came to the towns, but also, in all probability, a marginal situation or an actual nutritional deficiency in respect of protein. Clearer definition of the position cannot be obtained without moreknowledge than is yet available as to the quantity and character of foods that have beencoming into the Dutch towns to supplement the bare rations.The slender evidence we have arouses anxiety and leads us to anticipate that theeffects of underfeeding may have been more serious among the people of the largertowns of the Netherlands than in France and Belgium.Unfortunately, lack of time did not permit us to visit the towns inside the liberatedcorridor of Dutch territory. There were, however, disturbing reports from Civil Affairsofficers, who had seen conditions there, stating that the town populations looked in verypoor shape. Adults were verv thin and haggard and children looked frail, thin andpallid. It is improbable that their appearance was due entirely to the experiences theyhad passed through since their towns came into the fighting zone. The description oftheir state is more in keeping with their having been undernourished for a long time past.There is no information to show whether or not the people living in towns in theNetherlands still in German occupation are as badly affected as those of Eindhovenand Nijmegen but it seems unlikely that they are much better off. Recent events in western Netherlands and the threat of worse things to come arouse the gravest anxietyregarding the &quot;effects that shortage of food may have on the populations of the densely populated industrial areas there.8. The Nutritional Outlook,(a) France and Belgium.The prospects of the authorities being able to continue providing rations at thecurrent levels for the town populations appear to be reasonably good. There is, even,a measure of optimism in official circles in Paris and Brussels that small increasesmay be achieved when communication and transport are improved. . It seems reason-ably certain, therefore, that the people of the towns will be able to obtain rationed foodsproviding the ordinary consumer with from 1,500 1,700 calories a day and the workerswith an additional 2 300. But, as it has been pointed out in paragraph 4 above, that provision is inadequate to maintain the condition of the people, much less to enablethem to work.An ominous feature of the present situation is the disturbance, from one cause or another, of the systems by which the people of the towns secured additional food &quot; offthe ration &quot;. Many influences are combining to reduce the flow of supplies through these unofficial channels. Direct measures are being taken to restrict the activities ofthe black markets. Fears regarding the stability of the political and currency situationsare tending to encourage hoarding by the farmer. In Belgium, the new currencyregulations have caused a sharp fall in the purchasing power of people who formerlywere able to buy from the black market or direct from farms. It is impossible to foreseehow long these difficulties will complicate the picture, but if they bring about asubstantial reduction of the quantity of food that actually reaches the consumer during a large part of the approaching winter, which, in any case, will be one of many hard-ships, a serious nutritional situation may develop. At the worst, food conditions would tend to deteriorate as they did in 1940 and with the same consequences affecting publichealth.  The margin of safety seems to be smaller in Belgium than in Northern France.There would be less reason for being apprehensive if there were grounds for con-fidence in the authorities&apos; ability gradually to divert the foods concerned into the regularrationing channels of distribution. For the next few months, at least, the obstacles inthe way of their being able to do this will be so formidable that apprehension about thesituation that may develop appears to be justified. The problem is, however, one thatthe Governments in Paris and Brussels must solve. The food is there to provide aminimum of about 2,000 calories per head per day for the urban population of France,and the same level for the Belgian urban population for a period that would be deter-mined by the supply of individual commodities (see Part III).
Even if means are found to maintain the food consumption of the towns of northern france and Belgium at the current levels, which we estimate to be inside the range1,900 2,200 per head, it must be clearly understood that resumption of industrial activity at any higher scale than that existing immediately before liberation cannot possibly be achieved at such low levels. The quantity of additional food needed willbe directly proportional in its calorie equivalence to the magnitude of physical effortdemanded by the work. If the food is not forthcoming, the productive output cannotbe reached. This fact cannot be evaded. The range of calorie figures concerned is givenin paragraph 4 above.Fats and Meat.Discussions in Paris and in Brussels made it clear that, on supply considerations,there is a case for providing fats and meats, particularly the former, for both Franceand Belgium. (See Part I.) On nutritional grounds there is a very strong case for supporting these proposals to supply additional fat and animal protein food.Milk.Although under normal conditions there would be sufficient fresh milk to providefully the needs of expectant mothers, and children in the towns, transport is now sodisorganized that the maintenance of even a trickle of supplies for babies is proving verydifficult. There is, therefore, a strong case on nutritional grounds for making availablein appropriate areas stocks of evaporated or condensed milk from which supplies couldbe drawn to meet emergencies in towns.(o) Netherlands.The situation is so obscure that no appraisal of the nutritional outlook can be madebeyond saying that the scanty information that has come to hand suggests that supplieshave been more stringent than in France and Belgium and justifies grave apprehensionthat a serious position may be revealed when some of the large towns of Holland,particularly those in the West, are liberated.PART IIIFOOD SUPPLIES AND THE AGRICULTURAL AND LIVESTOCK OUTLOOKA. introductory. This section of the report discusses the present supply of foodstuffs in Franceand Belgium, and the outlook for future agricultural production. No attempt has beenmade to consider the position in Holland in the same way as little information is available beyond what was known before the invasion and as the food outlook theredepends primarily on the military developments outlined in Part I, and cannot yet be adequately assessed.2. It should be made clear at the outset that no precise figures are yet available of the production of crops and livestock products in France and Belgium or of the quantities reaching the towns. The extent to which figures were falsified under theoccupation to mislead the Germans, and the difficulty of collecting current information in view of the breakdown of communications make this inevitable. As communications are restored and the control of the central Governments becomes more complete this position will improve so that in two or three months it should be possible to clarifymany points which are still obscure. But it is doubtful if an entirely adequate statisticalpicture of food supplies can be drawn up before the next harvest. In the meantimeit will be necessary to rely to a large extent on the day to day observations and experi-ence of the SHAEF Missions who are working in close association with the local governments on these problems.3. Already, however, certain trends are becoming clear. It is reasonably certainthat in France and to a less extent in Belgium estimates of food supplies made before the liberation tended in many instances to be low and that not enough allowance was madefor deliberate understatement of the national food resources. It does not follow that thisis true of all. occupied countries. In Holland, for example, the scanty information available suggests that control was tighter and that the Dutch were less able than theFrench or Belgians to augment their meagre official rations; their nutritional status isreported to be considerably worse.4. Although with the new evidence available it is possible to make some correctionsto the estimates of food supplies prepared before the liberation there is much thatremains obscure. It is difficult, for example, to reconcile the absence of signs of seriousunderfeeding or malnutrition in Northern France with the estimates of food supplies available to town populations.   In Belgium the general appearance of the people is(19753) c 2
somewhat less satisfactory as might be expected in view of the smaller food resources ofthe country in relation to its population. The appearance of the people of northern france, however, suggests that relatively few adults have had an intake of less than2,000 calories a day and that some have had considerably more. This seems a con-servative estimate even when allowance is made for the reduced requirements resultingfrom the low degree of industrial activity. In the towns of Northern France the general impression was obtained that the overall average supply must have been appreciablyin excess of 2,000 calories. Such an average would imply that unrationed foodsamounted to 40- 50 per cent, of rationed supplies (a very high proportion) and if itwere true of the whole country would demand larger estimates of total food productionthan at present seem justified. It is likely, however, that Paris and other towns inNorthern France enjoyed better food than those in the South which are more remotefrom the main food producing areas, though the few reports on the condition of thepopulation in the South do not suggest prolonged conditions of severe shortage. the picture is thus incomplete and the position cannot be finally assessed until more completeinformation is available.5. For the present, therefore, it seems premature to attempt a revision of theestimates of food supplies as a whole in terms of calories and nutrients. To do so wouldinvolve a considerable element of guess work and further revision would undoubtedlybecome necessary before long in the light of changing circumstances and new informa-tion. Moreover, until the restoration of transport makes conditions in different areasmore uniform a national average is of questionable validity, at least in France. Wehave, therefore, limited ourselves on this side to a consideration of the supply position for each of the main commodities individually. In the commodity sections tentativeestimates have been given of the total supply and of the probable deficiency whereindigenous production is inadequate. These estimates are believed to be broadly correctso far as the total supply is concerned, though there is considerable doubt as to the quantities which will be available for feeding the towns. Estimates of deficiency areonly given to indicate the order of magnitude of the problem. They might needsubstantial revision if, for example, it proved impossible to re-establish quickly an effective system of food collection or if the grazing season next spring were unsatis-factory. Final estimates of import requirements can only be worked out on a fairlyshort term basis by the military authorities on the spot in conjunction with the nationaladministrations.6. A further word of caution should be added. It will be seen from the following paragraphs that supplies in France seem enough to provide an adequate though dulland monotonous diet to her population and supplies in Belgium enough to last for somemonths without imports provided that they can be properly collected and distributed.But this is a very large proviso in present circumstances. Transport and economic difficulties (the former predominant in France and the latter in Belgium) will certainlycontinue to impede effective collection and distribution for some time to come and may do so to an extent which makes additional help imperative. These difficulties mustconstantly be borne in mind in considering the supply position. The total quantities offood in the country are less significant than the quantities actually reaching urbanconsumers.7. Again a diet cannot be judged by calories and nutrients alone) and it should beremembered that even by British war-time standards, Western European diets to-dayare exceedingly plain and unpalatable, depending to an overwhelming extent on bread,potatoes and vegetables. Fats, meat, dairy produce and sugar, the foods which con-tribute most to the interest of a diet are in notably short supply, ranging from one quarter to one half of the restricted British war-time level. Coffee is virtually a thingof the past. For people accustomed to a varied &quot; Western &quot; type of diet, theseshortages constitute a serious hardship. This has been found even in Britain where thechange in the character of the diet has been very much less drastic. Strong pressure for improved rations must be expected. On political and psychological, if not on strictlynutritional grounds, there seems to be a good case for making some improvement in supplies of the preferred foods as soon as possible.B. France8. France is less highly industrialized than Belgium or Holland; those engaged inagriculture and their dependants make up about one third of the population and thearea of farm land, per head of population, is relatively large. In the last pre-war yearsFiance was virtually self-sufficient in regard to staple foodstuffs; the only major excep-tion was fats and oils, for which she depended on imports for about half her requirements.Fiance was also less dependent than other countries of North West Europe upon suppliesof agricultural raw materials, such as fertilizers and feeding stuffs. Again, most Frenchfarms are family holdings, and only certain branches of agriculture depend upon hiredlabour.   Self-sufficiency in food supplies and the maintenance of peasant farming have
long been among the major objects of national policy and it was the hope that, in theevent of war, the food supplies would not constitute a major problem. In fact, themaintenance of an adequate food supply has not been easy; firstly, because three-quarters of a million of able-bodied farm workers were lost; secondly, because the vichy government never succeeded in building up an efficient organization for the collection and distribution of food; and thirdly, by reason of heavy German requisitions of grainand meat.9. Mobilization interfered with the sowing of wheat in the autumn of 1939, and the invasion of 1940 further reduced the output during the first year of the war. The result was that food conditions in the consumption year 1940-41 were bad. More settledconditions prevailed later, but a full recovery in production was prevented by losses of manpower, while the seasons of 1941 and 1942 were unfavourable. The cultivated area in 1943 and 1944 was still about ten per cent, below that of the pre-war years, but theseseasons were favourable, and yields of both grain and potatoes were fair. Sugar beetsuffered through lack of labour for cultivation and lack of fuel for processing, and was in both years fully twenty per cent, below normal. No class of the French peopleco-operated fully with the Vichy Government in its attempts to build up an efficient and equitable system of food distribution. The peasants continued to consume more than their due share, black marketing was widespread and even government officials falsifiedstatistics and connived in illegal practices. German requisitions were a heavy burdenthroughout the occupation. In the last year the Germans took about 15 per cent, ofthe wheat and 25 per cent, of the meat which left farms. The loss of food supplies fellalmost entirely upon the urban population, the country people continuing to live verymuch as usual. The effect of the requisitions upon the urban diet was a decline of nearly400 calories per day in the energy intake. The meat requisitions resulted in a con-si considerable   over-slaughter of cattle, with a decline in numbers of cows. Requisition of horses reached considerable proportions as other means of transport became restricted.10. Towards the end of the occupation the normal urban consumer could count on receiving only some 1,400 calories per day from the official ration. Workers receivedsupplements bringing the urban average above this figure. Some of the food whichescaped official collection found its way to the towns by various means family parcelswere received, foraging expeditions were made to the country, and there was a con-si considerable   black market. In practice, a vast majority of city dwellers got appreciableamounts of food by these means; it seems possible that average total consumption was at least, and probably more than, 2,000 calories per day, but there was inevitably aconsiderable range of variations as between individuals. Supplies also varied from oneregion to another and from time to time. In particular there was usually a period ofscarcity before harvest. Regional prefects had authority to fix the ration scales in their particular areas in accordance with local supplies. In 1944 regional variations were greatly accentuated by the air offensive on the French railways. The South, which isa deficit area in regard to most staple foods, naturally suffered most and in severalsouthern departments even the bread ration fell seriously below the national scale. Inall the larger towns supplies of perishable foods, and particularly of milk, fell heavily.The prevailing conditions disrupted unofficial and illegal distribution as well as thesupply of official rations. Naturally, the transport difficulties led to the accumulation of foodstuffs, and loss of perishable materials, in areas of surplus production. This was,specially pronounced in Normandy.11. Since the liberation the food outlook has improved in some respects and hasworsened in others. The cessation of requisitions is a substantial gain but the destruc-tion of railway bridges and rolling stock, and the lack of lorries and tyres, have greatlyinterfered with the provisioning of the towns, particularly in the South. Even in Paristhe population is being fed by improvised methods. Cattle are being driven on footfrom as far afield as Brittany and Normandy to maintain meat supplies, and the limited numbers of lorries available are being used to collect other foods from the surrounding country. Lack of fuel, tyres and spare parts is a serious problem and though a steady improvement in deliveries was effected throughout September and earlyOctober it is clear that the system could easily break down. The lack of contact betweenthe Government in Paris and provincial officials is a great handicap in organizing supply.Moreover, it still remains to be seen whether the administrative control of the farm outputcan be made substantially more efficient than it has been. While farmers no longerhave the fear that full deliveries will benefit only their country&apos;s enemies, they are still under a strong temptation to market through illegal channels, and there is a natural hopethat controls should now be relaxed rather than tightened. In any case, it is clear thatthe physical obstacles to proper distribution will continue for some time.12. Official rations current in the middle of October in Paris (little is known of the scales elsewhere) were better in some respects than those which prevailed during the lastyear of occupation. The bread ration is now 350 grammes (12 oz.) daily, comparedwith 300 (ioj oz.) over most of 1943-44.   Meat is now 250 grammes (9 oz.) weekly
against 120 grammes (4 oz.) and fats 250 grammes per month against an average ofabout 235 grammes (8 oz.). These were obtainable, it is believed, fairly regularly.Potatoes were being distributed at the rate of 3 kg. weekly, a better allowance than wasbeing secured officially in earlier months. There was no change in the official allowance of sugar but distribution had been made in advance prior to the liberation, largely asa means of avoiding requisition by the Germans, and stocks are very low. Whole milk,as before, is distributed only to nursing and expectant mothers and to children up to 14years old. The official scales ruling in the last weeks of occupation were f of a litre dailyfor children under six, \ a litre for mothers and ^ of a litre for children between 6 and 14though, with the disruption of transport, these amounts were not fully obtainable.Other consumers were not entitled to rations, merely receiving skimmed milk whereavailable. The lack of transport still makes it impossible to ensure these scales. Theneeds in Paris on these rations are approximately 500,000 litres daily. The quantityactually arriving in the last days of September, after a steady improvement, had reached300,000 litres per day, but heavy losses, said to be up to 25 per cent., were being causedby souring owing to delays en route. A high priority for such transport as is available is being given to milk but a stable and ample supply must await improvements in themeans of transport.13. The official allowances of these various foodstuffs, as under the occupation,are supplemented by non-rationed foodstuffs and by such additional amounts of allcommodities, including those subject to official rationing, as consumers are able toobtain from their gardens or by means of expeditions on bicycles to the country, or bypurchases on the black market. These supplements form an appreciable addition tothe diet, but are almost certainly smaller than before the liberation owing to the suspension-sion of the parcels traffic caused by the transport shortage. It is not known how farconditions in Paris and other towns visited are representative for all urban areas inFrance, but it is probable that conditions are less favourable in the south and south-west.It is also uncertain whether the present situation can be maintained during the coming winter.14. The following notes on the staple foodstuffs indicate the general supply outlook.They show that if difficulties of transport and processing can be overcome supplies of most commodities in the country are sufficient to maintain food distribution at the sameor at higher levels than last year. The main shortage is fats. Meat is not likely to bemuch more plentiful than before as the effects of over-slaughtering during the occupationwill offset the absence of requisitions. Milk may be needed in limited quantities for distribution to children. Sugar will be in adequate supply if enough of the beet cropcan be processed, though of this there are serious doubts, and there appear to besufficient supplies of grain potatoes and vegetables. On psychological grounds thereis a good case for imports of coffee.COMMODITY SUPPLIES.15. Wheat and Rye. For the years 1935 38 the average production of wheat andrye was about 8-5 million tons. Imports and exports were small and fluctuating, withan average net import of o-i million tons. Imports were chiefly special types of wheat for macaroni and similar products. After making allowance for seed and waste, andfor grain used as fodder, the quantity available for milling was about 6-5 million tons annually. The yield of flour, at 70 per cent, extraction was 4-6 million tons, equivalentto no kilograms per head of population.16. The 1943 season was favourable and production was officially estimated at million tons; it was almost certainly higher though a good deal of the uncountedsupply was probably fed to livestock. The quantity available for milling was estimatedat 5-7 million tons. German requisition reduced the supply to the French population tolittle more than 5 million tons, equivalent at 95 per cent, extraction to about 4-8 million tons of flour or 120 125 kilos per head. These estimates include allowances for AlsaceLorraine which was supplied from Germany; they may be slightly on the low side.17. Despite shortages of fertilisers and other difficulties, the wheat crop of 1944 was good. The last official prediction was of a total production of 6-9 million tons (including0-4 million tons of rye) but actual yields seem generally to have exceeded expectations.Despite local damage by military operations the great bulk of the crop was safelyharvested. Production estimates as high as 8 million tons have been mentioned in conversation and 7-5 millions would seem to be a safe assumption. Making allowance for seed, etc., the quantity available for milling should be nearly 6 million tons. TheFrench authorities believe that in the absence of German requisitions wheat resourceswill be adequate, and have reduced the flour extraction rate to 85 per cent, from 1st October. This change will provide a more acceptable quality of bread and a much-needed supply of animal feeding stuffs.   At 85 per cent, extraction the output of flour
will be 5 million tons. The present population of France is considerably smaller thanthat of 1935 38. If it is assumed that the displaced population will return in the middleof the cereal year [i.e., in early Spring) the estimated output of flour would provide125 130 kilograms per head per year, as compared with 110 kilograms in pre-war years. Since supplies of other foods have been reduced this does not appear a large increase. The total quantity should be enough to maintain the present scale of rationsof 350 grammes of bread per day to normal consumers with&apos; extra allowances to producers and heavy workers. If owing to internal transport difficulties substantialimports have to be provided for some time to come to the deficit areas of the southit might be possible later to balance these by equivalent exports, e.g., to Belgium or to north Africa where there is said to be a substantial deficit.18. Potatoes. Pre-war production of potatoes was about 15 million tons. Afterdeductions for seed and for fodder and industrial uses, about 7 million tons remain for human consumption, or about 170 kilogrammes per head of population. Expan-sion of the acreage of oilseeds, shortage of labour and shortage of fertilisers havecombined to reduce the output, but it seems that official Vichy statistics which estimated the 1943 crop at only 6-5 million tons have greatly over-estimated the decline. french officials indicated in conversation that the 1944 farm crop may amount to 12 million tons. With some reduction in the use of potatoes for animal feeding it is not impossible that farm marketings should approach pre-war levels. The considerably increased output from gardens and allotments may enable consumption to reach, or even riseabove, pre-war levels. The supply should enable the town population to receive a rationsupplying over 200 calories daily. With the prevailing transport difficulties local shortages are probably inevitable, but meanwhile arrivals in Paris are very ample.Distribution in Paris is now at the rate of 3 kilos per head per week, and part of thearrivals is being stockpiled. French officials believe that it may be possible to de-rationpotatoes in certain areas. The south is a deficit region, and the chances of makingpotatoes freely available in Marseilles, Toulon, etc., are remote.19. Sugar. Average production of sugar beet for the years 1935 38 was estimatedat 8-3 million tons. Fully 70 per cent, of the crop was processed for sugar, yieldingabout 814 thousand tons (refined), the bulk of the remainder being converted intoindustrial alcohol. In this period there was an average annual net import of 129thousand tons. Total consumption was thus 943 thousand tons (22 kilos per head), ofwhich 84 per cent, was home grown.20. The beet crop of 1943 was estimated at 6 million tons, which yielded about500 thousand tons of sugar (besides industrial alcohol). Net German requisitions were84 thousand tons, leaving 416 thousand tons (10 11 kilos per head) for French con-sumption. Supplies for 1943 44 have thus been rather less than 50 per cent, of pre-war consumption.21. The supply of fertilisers for the 1944 sugar beet crop was short, the springwas dry and some fields, in October, bore signs of inadequate cultivation. The crop isprovisionally estimated at 5-5 million tons. The intention appears to be, so far aspracticable, to give the sugar factories priority over the distilleries. Efficient conversionof the whole crop into sugar would give some 750 800 thousand tons, or nearly doublelaspyear&apos;s supply. The quantity of sugar that will in fact be produced is a matter ofspeculation. It is thought that small growers will be able to harvest their beet, and indeed many in the northern areas have made some progress with the work. Largegrowers may have difficulty in securing the necessary numbers of workers: there wasin normal times a considerable seasonal inflow of labour from Belgium. Difficulties arealso expected in transporting beet to the factories and a special bonus is being offered to growers who can themselves deliver, but it may be anticipated that means will befound to transport a good deal of beet by narrow gauge railway, horse transport, etc.At present it appears that the limit of production will be the quantity of coal that can be delivered to the factories in time. The middle of October is the normal time for opening the factories, but capacity is such that a fortnights delay would involve very littleloss. Factories in the vicinity of coal mines have some stocks, and may get further supplies fairly soon. Those in areas remote from mines may probably get no supplies at all. The French Ministry of Food is meantime provisionally estimating that 300thousand tons of sugar may be produced, but the basis for any real estimate does not exist. An output of this order would, in the absence of imports, imply a reduction ofsome 30 per cent, on the meagre rations of 1943-44.22. Meat. The pre-War production of meat (beef, veal, mutton, lamb and hamin France was variously estimated at 1-5 to 1-7 million tons per annum. Net imports were negligible, averaging only 0-025 million tons. Per capita annual consumption was about 40 kilos, or two thirds of that of the United Kingdom.
23. There has certainly been a sharp fall in production during the war years, but no reliable estimate can be made of current production. Output in 1943-44 was estimated in London at ri million tons. A French official estimate for the calendar year 1944 is 0-9 million tons, while an estimate of 0-75 millions for 1945 was mentionedin conversation by French officials. At present, however, no figures can be more than an informed guess as Vichy statistics are of doubtful accuracy and in some cases were deliberately falsified. There is as yet no good information about numbers of animalsdestroyed during military operations or carried away in the German retreat but it isbelieved that losses, except of horses, have been small in relation to the livestockpopulation as a whole.24. The French estimates quoted above may be too low, but there is clear evidencethat there has been a heavy over-slaughter of cattle. The bulk of current suppliesseems to be composed of old or otherwise unsatisfactory cows, either lean or only halffattened, of yearling animals in fair conditions and calves. If conditions improve sothat herds can be restored to normal numbers beef supplies will be restricted over aperiod of years. The fall in the output of beef and veal is explained partly by the reduced number of breeding cows. The latest official figures (for October, 1943) givea total cattle population of only 4 per cent, less than that of the pre-war years, but thedrop in numbers of cows was substantially greater and the fall has continued sharplyin the past twelve months. Again, there has been a fall in the average slaughterweight though not, perhaps, as much as was believed in London. Slaughter animalsinclude a proportion&quot; of very lean cows, but also a considerable proportion of all agesthat are in fair condition. Official figures (October,&apos; 1943) show falls of 33 per cent, insheep and 44 per.cent, in pigs, compared with 1938; but no reliance can be placed onthese. Some French observers believe that pigs are almost as numerous as they werein the ore-war years.25. The estimated production for 1943/4 t1&quot;1 million tons) should, after allowing for German requisitions, have provided about 24 kilograms per head of population, or about 60 per cent, of pre-war consumption. But consumption on farms has been, andis, on a much higher level than &quot;urban consumption; moreover, a large part of the supply to the towns, during the German occupation, went through illegal channels. Henceofficial rations to urban consumers have been very low. During the greater part of theyear that of the normal consumer has been at the rate of about 6-g kilos, per year, with,however, larger allowances for heavy workers, etc. ; The current Paris ration is at therate of 14 kilos a year, about one-third of the peace-time French consumption, and alsoabout one-third of present British rations. The quantities obtained by individual con-sumers by other means, including the black market, are, of course, variable and no estimate of the quantities involved is available. Whether the present rations (whichare very low by British standards) can be maintained from home-produced supplies isdoubtful and depends as much on the success of the French authorities in securingcontrol of supplies as on the quantities of meat produced. Effective control of collection and distribution will clearly be impossible until transport and communications become more normal and even then will be difficult to establish. There is a considerable dangertoo of further depleting herds if meat production is pushed too high. The french administration does not consider that the ration can in fact be maintained without imports and has asked for 27,500 tons of canned meat up to the end of the year: part of this,however, is to stockpile against the needs of returning prisoners and deportees.26. Milk. In the late thirties France had a cattle population of some 15! millions,of which about half were cows. The average yearly milk yield was given in the 1929census at 1,730 litres (380 gallons) and seems to have changed little in the following tenyears. Average annual production in the period 1935-38 is estimated as 14-3 million tons, or about 3,150 million gallons. Thus, despite the low yield per cow, productionper head of the human population was more than twice as high as in Britain.27. The dairy industry of France differs from that of Britain in several respects.On the average, French farms are both smaller and less highly specialized so that theaverage dairy herd is much smaller. In the pre-war period about 70 per cent, of the milk output was produced on farms of less than 24 acres, and on most of these milk production was only one of several enterprises. Many &quot; herds &quot; consisted of one, twoor three cows. Dairy equipment on most of the small farms is primitive. Again, exceptnear towns, cows were normally wintered on hay, straw and roots, and a majority weremated to calve in late winter and early spring. Hence winter production was low.Lack of oilcakes, imported maize, etc., has increased the difference between summer and winter yields.&apos; Thirdly, France was, before the war, practically self-sufficient in regardto butter and cheese as well as fluid milk. Fourthly, except in urban areas, the customwas to fatten nearly half the calves for veal, using large quantities of whole milk for thepurpose. Finally, except in Charentes and in Normandy where there are large numbersof dairy factories, butter and cheese making were largely farmhouse industries.
28. In the period 1935-38 utilization is estimated to have been:-MilliontonsLiquid consumption   ...      ...      ...      ... 4&quot;3 30Butter    ...      ................ 4-35 30Cheese    .................. 2-00 14Stock feeding   .........      ...... 3 -45 24Miscellaneous    ...      ...      ...      ...      ... - 20 130 per cent.y yEven with this large diversion to other purposes, human consumption of liquid milkwas estimated at 104 litres per person per year, or about 0-55 pints per day: this was slightly higher than in Britain.29. In the absence of reliable figures, it is not possible to make any confidentestimate of current milk production. A French estimate puts the total output at   million tons and appears to assume that there are now some 6 million cows with anaverage yield of about 1,500 litres. The latest enumeration of dairy cows seems tohave been in 1941 when 6-47 million were returned, but this is a Vichy figure and maybe understated. The estimated production of 9 million tons may be on the low side,but it is doubtful if production could be more than 10 million tons. On the basis of9 million tons it is assumed that about 4-5 million tons would be retained on farms, ofwhich about two-thirds would be used for the rearing of calves. Of the remaining4 - 5 millions it is estimated that 2 - 7 million tons would be used for butter, o - 3 million tons for cheese and the remaining 1-5 million tons for liquid consumption. Since cheese making is largely a farm house industry and since cheese has a high value on the black market it is unlikely that production would fall so drastically and it seems doubtful ifthere would be more than a bare million tons for liquid consumption by the urbanpopulation.30. Whole milk is reserved for nursing and expectant mothers and for children.The million tons indicated above would theoretically provide these classes with half alitre (nearly one pint) per head daily. But during September arrivals in Paris weresufficient to provide only about half this quantity, and there was considerable loss bysouring. Quantities available elsewhere are not known, but reports indicated that theposition in the south has been substantially worse. The situation can be remedied only by an improvement in transport facilities. When this is secured an attempt could bemade to allocate more milk for human consumption in towns, and to raise productionin the liquid milk producing areas. The former end could be secured by reducing the quantities of whole milk now devoted to calf rearing, and the latter by allotting suppliesof oilseed residues and milling offals to liquid milk sellers. In view of present difficultiesa request has been received for import of 4,400 tons of evaporated milk per month untilthe end of the year. The situation may be summarized by saying that there would beno overall shortage of milk if a due proportion could be used for liquid consumption.There is, however, a. shortage of fats, which introduces a difficulty. The other problem is to secure a proper allocation of milk as between animals, the farm population and the urban consumers.31. Fats. In the last few pre-war years human consumption of &quot; visible &quot; fats(i.e., fats other than those contained in meat, milk, cheese and fish) was rather morethan half a million tons annually, reckoned as pure fat. This provided an average of13 kilograms per person per year, or about nine ounces per head per week. about one-third of the whole was home-produced butter while rather more than half was derivedfrom vegetable and marine oils almost wholly imported, but including a small amountof home-produced olive oil.   The balance consisted of home-produced beef-fat, lard, etc.- 32. Some small imports of oil seeds and oils continued to be made up till the liberation of North Africa, since which time France has been obliged to depend entirely on her domestic production. Thus, war conditions produced a far greater gap in supplies of fats than in those of any other staple food. The situation arising from theloss of imports has been aggravated by a decline in the domestic output of butter, lard,etc. For the current year, French officials provisionally estimate butter production at no thousand tons, as against a normal peace-time output of 200 thousand, and produc-tion of pig fat at less than half the normal. These estimates are believed to bepessimistic, but it cannot be doubted that output will be very much below normal.Finally, the intake of &quot; invisible &quot; fat (in meat, cheese and milk) has also fallen heavily.The cultivation of oil seeds has been developed in an effort to offset these losses. an appreciable contribution was made by these crops in 1943, and a further increase mayhave been secured in 1944. Information about acreages and yields of these crops(coleseed, sunflower and poppy) is scanty, and it would be unsafe to make a more precisestatement than that the total yield of oil will be between 25 and 50 thousand tons; this includes the normal small quantity of olive.oil.
If to the estimated production of no thousand tons of butter (equivalent to 93thousand tons of fat) is added a conservative estimate of other domestic resources wearrive*at a figure of about 17b thousand tons of pure fat, equivalent to 4-2 kilos per head. The true figure may be nearer 5 kilos per head. This compares with a pre-war consumption of 13 kilos per head.33. Distribution of available supplies has been, and remains, inequitable. the farm population, numbering about a third of the total, retains much more than its shareof butter and lard, and a good deal of the remainder passes through the black market.As a consequence the amount available for official distribution has been very smalland for the last year of occupation the ration to normal consumers averaged just under  oz. per week (2-4 kilos a year as pure fat). The present Paris ration of 250 grammesper month (of butter, etc.) is only fractionally higher. It is the immediate objective of the French authorities to provide this quantity for the whole country, and to do this a request was originally submitted for imports of 37 thousand tons of oil to the end ofthe year, part of which was to form a reserve stock. This request has since beenreduced to 6-3 thousand tons for immediate consumption.34. Even the Paris ration, of 250 gms. per month (about 2 oz. per week) is very low, and, both for nutritional and for psychological reasons, considerably larger supplies are greatly to be desired. There seems to be little prospect of increasing domestic produc-tion during 1944-45. The only possible means of doing so would be to divert milk fromcalf feeding to butter making, but under present conditions it would be difficult to bringeffective pressure to bear on farmers. Imports of oilseeds, besides making possible anincrease in the fat ration, would provide, in the oilseed residues, a much-needed supplyof protein for cattle. This in turn, if properly distributed, would help to increase the domestic output of daily products.The Agricultural and Livestock Situation.35. According to the official statistics the area of the main food crops (cereals,potatoes, sugar beet and oilseeds) was about 13 per cent, lower in 1944 than in the period1935-38. The decline is said to have occurred mainly in the mountain regions and inthe less fertile parts of the South. At all events scarcely any derelict fields are to beseen in the North East. It is possible that crop acreages, like crop yields and numbersof small livestock, have been deliberately underestimated in the hope of keeping downGerman demands. The decline, whatever its amount, is attributed to shortage of manpower, but it may also be due, in part, to the general reluctance on the part of farmers to produce for the benefit of Germany.36. The average number of cattle in the years 1935-38 was about 15-7 millions.Herds were fully maintained until the autumn of 1942 (15-8 millions), but a year laterhad fallen to an estimated 14-5 millions. A further drop to 14-1 millions Was predicted(without allowance for losses due to military action) by the autumn of 1944. No returns are of course available. Apparently the German authorities were able to make theirown enumerations of cattle in sample areas, so that the official statistics must be accepted as substantially correct. Losses resulting from military operations were of course severein particular regions, but small in relation to the cattle population as a whole. Existingnumbers may be put at about 14 millions, a fall of ten or eleven per cent, as comparedwith the pre-war total. The fall in numbers of cows may be higher, in proportion, thanthat in total cattle. German requisitions were for stipulated numbers of animals of notless than 440 lb. carcase weight so that few yearlings were up to specification, and farmerschose to part with cows rather than with work oxen. Numbers of work oxen seemto have increased.37. Farmers, with the connivance of French officials, seem to have defeated all german attempts to enumerate pigs and sheep. Hence the official statistics (which showfalls of 44 per cent, in pigs and 34 per cent, in sheep) must be regarded as quitemeaningless. The common opinion is that pigs are about as numerous (6A millions) asthey were before the war, and that the drop in sheep, from the pre-war total of 9-8millions, has been unimportant.   Goats have probably increased.38. Numbers of horses, which stood at 2-60 millions in 1938, declined progressivelyduring the occupation to 2-22 in 1941, 2-19 in 1942, and 2-12 in 1043. The predictionfor October, 1944, made without reference to the effect of military operations afterD-day, was 2-08 millions. The official figures, like those for cattle, may be accepted as substantially correct. Large numbers were commandeered by the Germans during their retreat but a fair proportion were recovered later. Existing numbers may probablybe put at a little less than two millions, a loss of 25 per cent, from 1938. Prices of horses are extremely high (figures of 100,000 and even 150,000 francs were mentionedfor the best young heavy draft animals). The non-farmer demand, however, has risengreatly by reason of the lack of other means of&apos; transport. The growing shortage on farms has been partly made good by retaining work oxen beyond the normal age for
disposal, but has been aggravated by the shortage of tractor fuel. The situation inregard to work animals, at least in the region north of the Loire, is thus a very difficultone39. In the northern half of France, which produces by far the greater part of thecountry&apos;s foodstuffs, the weather of 1943-44 seems to have been much the same as in southern England an exceptionally mild and dry Winter followed by drought inSpring and early Summer and by abundant rains in late Summer and Autumn. Theone material difference is that France had good weather during the grain harvest.These conditions produced good crops of wheat, winter oats and potatoes, and fair cropsof spring corn. In some areas there was delay in the germination of root seeds, butboth sugar beet and mangolds recovered later. . The main hay crop was very poorindeed and, although second cuts made up part of the deficit, the total stock of hay inOctober was much below normal.40. Pasture conditions in May-July were very bad, and even lucerne, which is largely used as summer food for housed cattle, yielded poorly. Milk yields fell, and allstock lost condition. Autumn growth, however, was good. In October, though somemilking cows were still rather low, the majority were in fair order. Young stockgenerally looked well.   Most horses were in good working order.41. Except in the region of the beachhead, military operations stopped farm workonly for a few days, and in mid-October the general position was that autumn operations were only about a week behind-hand. A journey from Brussels to Paris on October 15thpresented a picture of winter oats already up; many fields sown with wheat and others in various stages of preparation; few potatoes remaining in the fields; mangold and sugar beet lifting well begun and two out of some ten or twelve sugar factories inoperation; many corn stacks and few of new straw substantiating the general opinionthat threshing is about a month in arrear.42. Despite the shortages of manpower, horses and tractor fuel, preparation for the1945 grain crop seemed fairly well forward. Given normal weather during the rest ofthe Autumn the acreage sown should be of the same order as last year. adequate supplies of fungicides for seed dressing have been provided. The chief anxiety for the1945 crop arises from the lack of phosphate fertilizers. It is true that virtually nophosphate was available for the 1943 and 1944 crops and that over-average yields per acre were nevertheless produced in both years. Both seasons, however, wereexceptionally favourable for wheat: i.e., dry and sunny. Average weather conditionsin 1945 must be expected to produce less than average yields, and a wet and sunlesssummer must be expected to produce a very poor crop.43. The shortage of phosphates, unlikely to reach even half the normal amounts,is also likely to affect next year&apos;s sugar beet and potato crops. In the case of potatoesthere may also be difficulties in regard to seed. In peace-time France relied on Hollandfor considerable supplies of healthy seed. These supplies have been restricted andGerman seed substituted. There seems to be very little experience with American andBritish varieties though an enquiry was made as to the possibility of obtaining substantialsupplies of seed of early varieties from the United Kingdom. The substitution of &quot; twicegrown &quot; for &quot; once grown &quot; seed will mean poorer crops.   s44. As was to be expected, farmers and agricultural officials have many anxieties &apos;about the future, mostly in regard to supplies of farm requirements. Since practical^no phosphate has been available for the past two years it is the general hope amongfarmers that imports may be given a high priority. Whether this is practicable depends on available port capacity. Many worn-out implements are to be seen, and supplies of essential parts, such as plough-shares are greatly needed. Shortage of fuel, for tractorsand threshing engines, is causing delay in operations. The position in regard to sacksand other containers rexcepting milk churns is better than expected, though the war-time sack, woven from paper yarn, is said to have a very short life. The generaltransport situation is causing great difficulties in the marketing of milk and otherperishables. On the larger farms it is hard to get or to keep a sufficient labour force, and liberal perquisites in the form of pork, butter, etc., have to be provided to attractworkers. Many family-sized holdings were over-manned in normal times, and on mostof these work is well forward. No great emphasis was laid on the lack of animal feeding stuffs and, in fact, a good deal of sound grain is being used for pig and poultryfeeding.45. Farmers, and also officials working in the field, are more or less concerned about future prices, i.e., about the relationship between the prices of farm products andthose of farm requirements. Farmers have, no doubt, fairly substantial cash reserves,varying in individual cases according to the extent to which they have sold on blackmarkets. The doubt is whether these reserves, with the admittedly low level of officialprices, will be sufficient to pay for machinery, equipment, fertilisers and other require-ments. Despite these doubts and discouragements the general impression is that farmers are behaving well. There is no increased tendency to hoard food or otherwise obstruct the Governments efforts to re-organize the nation.
C. BelgiumGENERAL FOOD CONDITIONS.46. Before the war Belgium was one of the least self-sufficient countries in Europe,producing only about half the food she consumed. She was heavily dependent on imports for bread-grain and edible oils and fats. In potatoes, sugar, fruit and vegetables,domestic production was adequate or nearly so. The output of meat, milk and butterwas also almost large enough to cover the country&apos;s requirements; but the productionof these commodities rested very largely on imported grain and oilcake derived fromimported oilseeds.47. When normal imports were cut off following the German occupation no greatexpansion of agricultural production was possible as the available agricultural land was already intensively cultivated; there was little grassland that could be ploughedand made to produce crops for human consumption. The situation was met by divert-ing home produced grains, in particular rye, from livestock feeding to direct human consumption and, as a further economy, by raising the extraction rate of flour. these measures, together with the loss of imported feeding stuffs necessarily involved a sharpdrop in supplies of meat and other livestock products. Attempts were also made todevelop the cultivation of oilseeds. These measures succeeded in their object of stretch-ing native resources but they could not provide sufficient supplies to support even aminimum subsistence, and Germany was forced to permit some imports of bread-grainin each year of the occupation.48. The fall in the consumption of foodstuffs since pre-war years has been sub-stantial. The agricultural population have been able to maintain their diet approxi-mately at its pre-war level, but this class represents only one sixth of the population.The remainder, which includes a large proportion of industrial workers with highnutritional needs, have been obliged to bear the brunt of the fall in supplies. Duringthe last twelve months of occupation, the urban population probably did not receiveon the average appreciably more than 2,000 calories per head per day as compared witha pre-war average of approximately 2,600 or 2,700 per day. The liberation of thecountry has&quot; not fundamentally changed its food situation. The enemy did notappreciably reduce the country&apos;s food supplies by requisitioning. Crop production in1944 was at about the same level as in the previous year and the supply outlook in1944-45 is therefore approximately the same as in 1943-44.49. The liberation, however, has given rise to difficulties in the distribution of food-stuffs in the towns which render the maintenance of official rations highly precarious.Military operations though rapidly uncovering a large proportion of the country andcausing, so far as is known at present, little loss of food supplies, were responsible forsome delay in farm work, particularly threshing, which was accentuated by general shortage of transport and fuel. The transport situation also impedes the movement offood supplies, though to a much smaller extent than in France. In addition to thesephysical obstacles, there were others of a political or economic character. The adminis-trative organization for the collection of crop produce developed during the german occupation was abolished by the restored Government, but the measure announcing the retention of the general administrative arrangements was only published after a delay of some weeks. In the interval considerable communal autonomy in the disposalof food supplies prevailed to the detriment of the larger towns. There was dissatisfaction-tion also among farmers when they found that many of the local officials responsiblefor farm produce collection during the German occupation were still in office. Againthere is much dissatisfaction among farmers over official prices for farm produce whichthey consider unduly low in relation to prices of farm requisite. Deliveries of food from farms have also been impeded, at least temporarily, by the currency reform.There v/as a leakage of information about the Governments intentions and farmersbecame uncertain of the stability of the currency, lhey were, therefore, reluctant tosell either to official agencies or through the black market. Patrons of the black markethave in any case had their purchasing power so drastically curtailed that they found it difficult to buy. Though the volume of this traffic was never as large as in France, it did provide some townspeople with a means of supplementing their official rations.50. The effect of all these difficulties has been a deterioration in food conditions.Deliveries of produce by farmers which in more settled conditions would have been substantial immediately after the harvest, were consequently at a low level. The mission was informed, for example, that up to early October only 30,000 tons of bread-grain ofthe new crop had been delivered to official receiving agencies as compared with 150,000tons a year ago. The deterioration began with the invasion of the Continent by theAllies, when transport began to be seriously affected, and continued up to late September.During part of this period, before the new grain crop was available, bread rations couldnot be maintained. Supplies of flour, owing to the inability or reluctance of the germans to provide sufficient imports, were running out.   The slow rate at which the new crop
became available delayed an improvement. There was simultaneously an end-of-seasonshortage ol potatoes. The iats ration, since the exhaustion 01 margarine supplies, haddepended on current butter supplies, and had dropped to about 80 grammes (2^ oz.)weekly. The physical and administrative difficulties mentioned above prevented a recovery immediately after the harvest. Some improvement has, nevertheless, been achieved in recent weeks, though it is not yet certain whether a stable situation has beenreached. The bread ration by mid-October had reached 300 grammes daily, and it isbelieved that this is being regularly met. A good potato crop and a fair (but seasonal)supply of fruit and vegetables are other advantages.51. The present scale of rations provides normal consumers with about 1,500calories. Taking into account workers&apos; allowances and unrationed foods, the overallaverage intake in towns since the virtual extinction of the black market is probably notmore than 1,700 calories. If the unofficial sources of supply were restored the averagemight become a little higher, though the total intake could hardly reach the level possiblein France.   The food is not there.The present rations of grains, fats and possibly meat cannot be maintained until thenext harvest from the country &apos;s own resources and some indication of the magnitude ofthe likely deficiency is given in the commodity notes which follow. These figures are,of course, no more than illustrative and are not to be regarded in any way as a suggestedprogramme. They may need substantial modification in view of the many uncertaintiesof the position.In general, however, it may be said that substantial imports of bread-grains and fats will certainly be necessary. Small imports of milk may prove necessary for children. Meat may be needed to maintain existing rations and certainly will be ifrations are increased. Domestic supplies of sugar and potatoes should be adequate.Finally, there is a strong case on psychological grounds for imports of coffee, though this adds nothing to the nutritive value of the diet.As the food consumption level in Belgium is lower than in France, greater pressuremust be expected to secure both larger quantities and a greater variety of foods. sooner or later this pressure will be successful. In the meantime a great deal depends on whether the Government can re-establish an effective collection machinery. If it doesnot a serious situation will develop.COMMODITY SUPPLIES.52. Wheat and Rye. Before the war the average production of bread-grains in belgium was rather more than 800 thousand tons, while average imports amounted toabout 1,200 thousand tons, giving a total supply of about 2,000 thousand tons. after allowing for seed, wastage and extensive feeding of rye to livestock, the quantityavailable for human consumption may be estimated at nearly 1,400 thousand tons,equivalent to an average consumption of about 112 kilogrammes per head of flour of70 per cent, extraction.53. Production in the last year of the occupation was also about 800 thousand tonsand imports allowed by Germany about 100 thousand tons. In spite of maximumdiversion of supplies to direct human consumption and lengthening the extraction rate to 95 per cent., per capita supplies can hardly have been more than 90-95 kilos of flourper head, and in towns little more than 85 kilos per head.54. Production of bread-grains for 1944-45 is provisionally estimated at 860 thousand tons, of which not more than some 500 thousand tons are likely to be available for urbanconsumers after allowing for seed, waste and consumption on farms. Consumption to end October will probably account for some 100 thousand tons of the new crop, leaving a balance of about 400 thousand tons.The Belgian Government has recently reduced the extraction rate for flour to85 per cent.; at this extraction rate the end-October supply would correspond to some340 thousand tons of flour, or some 7 months&apos; supply at the present ration of 300grammes of bread per day for normal consumers. This estimate provides for the usualallowances to heavy workers and for some return of displaced persons later in the cropyear. Imports required to the end of August, when the new crop would be available,would thus be about 3 months supply: about 150 thousand tons of flour or 180 thousand tons of wheat. This is appreciably more than imports in the last year of the occupation,the additional 80 thousand tons representing partly a small increase in the ration andpartlv the change in the extraction rate.If it became necessary to increase the bread ration to 400 grammes per day the monthly requirement of flour would be increased from 50 to 68 thousand tons, at whichrate the end-October stocks would represent only 5 months supply. Imports of about340 thousand tons of flour or 400 thousand tons of wheat would then be necessary tocarry the country to the next harvest.
It should be emphasized that the above estimates are necessarily highly tentativeat this stage : in particular they make no allowance for any additional feeding to livestockwhich&apos;might occur if deliveries from farms were seriously delayed. It is also to benoted that a considerable over-lap would be necessary between the exhaustion of domesticsupplies and the start of imports to maintain a working stock and to allow for the gradualtailing off of deliveries from farms.55. Potatoes.-Before the war production averaged about 2,400 thousand tons per year, anu numan consumption (alter auuwmg iui sccu, wasic am-i iut,uui5 u/ 1*. ^biuc&amp;jabout 1,400 thousand tons, a national average of 165 kilos per head. In the last year of occupation production was estimated at about 2,500 thousand tons, and human consumption at about 1,550 thousand tons or 200 kilos per head over the whole countryand perhaps 190 kilos in towns.The 1944 acreage and crop has been somewhat reduced by flooding and is at present estimated at about 2,050 thousand tons. Belgian officials considered that it should bepossible to maintain the present ration of 500 grammes per day to urban consumers,though on the present figures it appears that there may be some danger of a shortagetowards the end of the year.56. Sugar. There has been no marked change in the production or consumptionof sugar during the war years. Production in 1935-37 averaged 216 thousand tons, therewas a very small net import and per capita consumption may be estimated at about24 kilos. Production from the 1944 crop is expected to be about 200 thousand tons: no special difficulties in processing are expected and it should thus be possible to maintainpractically the normal rate of consumption without imports.57. Meat. Before the war the production of meat in Belgium averaged about 320thousand tons, of which about 150 thousand tons was beef and veal and 160 thousand tons pig meat. Net imports amounted to about 25 thousand tons, giving a total supplyof nearly 350 thousand tons or 40-45 kilos per head, about three-quarters of the pre-warrate of consumption in the United Kingdom.58. Shortage of feeding stuffs has entailed a reduction in livestock numbers sincethe war, the relative figures being as follows:  No. Livestock (000 head)P re-War       May, 1944Cattle..................      I757 1,490(of which cows) ...       ......       ...       (973) (815)Pigs    ...      ...      ............      1,070 416Sheep and goats      ...       ...       ...       ... 345 410The 1944 figures for cattle are believed to be substantially correct, but those for pigsare certainly too low. Belgian officials thought that there might be as many as 200thousand pigs in the country in addition to those returned in the official census.59. Allowing for some reduction in carcase weights since the war, the official live-stock numbers would correspond with a current rate of production of perhaps 70-75thousand tons of beef and veal, 50 thousand tons of pork and 5 thousand tons of mutton and horseflesh, giving a total of some 125 thousand tons of meat. This might beincreased by another 20 thousand tons if the numbers of pigs not returned are of theorder indicated. Up to now, however, only beef, veal and horseflesh have been movedthrough official channels of distribution in any quantity. Pig meat deliveries were verysmall and almost the whole supply appears to be consumed on farms or to move intotowns outside the rationing scheme.60. The present meat ration to normal consumers is 35 grammes per day, about one-third of United Kingdom supplies. This compares with 20 grammes in the lastyear of the occupation, and requires an annual supply of about 120 thousand tons of meat. In theory it should thus be possible to maintain this ration from domesticresources. Whether this can be done in practice is rather doubtful and depends entirely on the success of the Belgian administration in getting control of available supplies,particularly of pork.61. Milk. There has been a marked fall in the production of milk in Belgium,partly because of the decline of 16 per cent, in the number of dairy cows, but stillmore because of the lower yield per cow resulting from the shortage of feeding stuffs.Before the war high yields were maintained by the extensive use of imported concen-trates, now lost, and home-produced grains, now largely diverted to direct human consumption. Belgian statistics indicate that the average yield of 3,100 litres per year before the war has been reduced by more than a third and is now only about 2,000 litresper year. Total production may thus be estimated at about 3,000 thousand tons beforethe war and 1,600 thousand tons per year at the present time, and the supply availablefor human consumption after allowing for calf feeding at about 2,650 thousand tonsand 1,300 thousand tons respectively.
3i62. These quantities were utilized approximately as follows:  1935-381943-44Thousand per thousand PerTons   Cent.Tons   Cent.350      27930      71Liquid milk............        650      25Butter ............     1,800      68Cheese, etc.  ...      ...      ...      ...        200       720       22,650    1001,300100There has thus been no fundamental change in the pattern of utilization of wholemilk, and apart from present dislocations none is expected in the immediate future. Theper capita consumption of liquid, milk was about 80 litres per year before the war, corn-pared with about 100 in France and United Kingdom, and has now fallen to about45 litres. In towns consumption is restricted to children and nursing and expectant mothers, and the overall average is unlikely to be much in excess of 35 litres per year.It should be noted that much of the milk for liquid consumption is standardized to 2 - 5per cent, fat content and the cream removed used for butter.There has, however, been a considerable change in the utilization of skim milkfrom butter production, which before the war was almost entirely for animal feeding.Since the occupation one-third to one-half has been used for human consumption, partly as a ration to adolescents and partly in the manufacture of cheese and other products.Deliveries of skim milk to towns have been temporarily interrupted since the liberation.63. Fats. Before the war Belgium consumed annually about 70 thousand tonsof butter and 30 thousand tons of lard and other animal fats, both almost entirely home produced, equivalent to about 8 kilos per head of butter and 3 kilos of lard and animalfats. Net imports of oil seeds, vegetable oils and marine oils averaged about 128thousand tons (oil equivalent) of which some 70 thousand tons or 8 kilos per head are estimated to have been used for human consumption and the rest for industrial purposesincluding soap making. Total supplies of visible fats were thus about 18 kilos per head(fat content) compared with about 20 in the United Kingdom.64. Butter production has now fallen to about 32 thousand tons, rather less than half the pre-war level, while the decline in animal fat production is of the same order and available supplies are largely used for soap. Attempts have been made to cultivatecolza and other oil seeds to replace imported supplies, but production from the 1944 cropwill only amount to about 10 thousand tons. Available supplies of fat thus appear tobe about 5^ kilos per head, or about 30 per cent, of the pre-war level. Consumption on farms is substantially above this average and urban supplies correspondingly lower.65. Rations to normal urban consumers at present amount to 200 grammes of margarine and 250 grammes of butter per month (together equivalent to about ^ lb. perweek). A decline in the butter fraction to 150 grammes must be expected during thewinter months. If the combined ration is maintained at 450 grammes by increasingissues of margarine, available supplies of oils are estimated to be exhausted in February.Imports would subsequently be necessary at the rate of about 2 thousand tons of oil per -month, with some reduction to perhaps 1,000 or 1,500 tons when butter supplies increasein the late spring: it is impossible to be more precise. These estimates allow for theusual additional allowances to heavy workers.The Belgian authorities are, however, anxious to increase the ration. If the com-bined ration were raised to 550 grammes it is estimated that supplies of oil for margarinewould be exhausted in January and that imports would then be needed at the rate of2,500 tons of oil per month, again with some reduction during the spring.AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK.66. The utilization of land in Belgium changed but little during the war. Produc-tion of wheat and barley increased, but chiefly at the expense of oats and rye. as already noted, there was nowhere much opportunity to increase the tillage area. Peace-time per capita consumption of potatoes was very high about twice that of Great Britain so that any large change over from bread to potatoes was hardly practicable. Cultiva-tion of coleseed (rape) was developed as a substitute for imported oil seeds.67. Crop yields in pre-war Belgium were very high e.g., 22^ cwt. (5 quarters) per acre of wheat, nearly 12 tons of sugar beet and about 8 tons of potatoes. Four main factors accounted for this exceptional level of production, viz.: (i) There was a verylarge farm labour force in relation to the crop area, and therefore a very intensiveapplication of hand labour, (ii) There was a large livestock population per unit area,maintained with the help of considerable imports of feeding stuffs, (iii) A high degreeof care was exercised in the conservation and use of animal manure, (iv) Consumptionof fertilizers was extremely high about four times as large, per unit area, as in Britain.
68. Under war conditions cultivation has been less intensive, though there are no signs of serious neglect. Livestock numbers have fallen only moderately, but feedinghas been much less liberal so that the supply of animal manure has declined, and thequality has deteriorated. Indigenous production of nitrogen fertilisers, which on balancecovered domestic consumption has been heavily reduced during the war in order to economise coal. Home production of basic slag has continued, but this covered only asmall part of total phosphate requirements, and imports of phosphate during the occupa-tion have been negligible. Potash is the only nutrient that has been in abundantsupply.Despite the high condition of Belgium&apos;s soil at the beginning of the war some fall inyields was inevitable under these circumstances but, with favourable seasons in 1943 and1944, this had not been serious probably about ten per cent.69. The decline in cattle numbers up till the summer of this year is estimated at only 15 per cent. The fall in milch cows has, however, been proportionately heavier,and the milk yield per cow has declined by about one-third. Slaughter weights of cattlehave also fallen. As in France, official statistics for pigs seem to have greatlyexaggerated the decline. The fall in numbers of horses is estimated at about 12 per cent.Losses due to military operations were small, so that, by contrast with France, the horsesituation is not critical. The Germans did not take away pedigree stallions or, except by chance, specially good breeding mares.70. Weather conditions in 1943-44 were similar to those described for France, andproduced broadly the same results good yields of&apos; cereals and potatoes, variable cropsof sugar-beet and fodder roots, and very light crops of hay. By October, farm animalshad generally recovered from the effects of the early summer drought and cattle were,if anything; in rather better condition than those of France.71. Farm operations, in mid-October, were perhaps a little farther advanced thanin France. In particular, considerable quantities of beet had already been delivered to factories, which had mostly started work. Anxiety about the possibility of processingthe crop was much less than in France.72. Wage-paid labour constitutes a relatively small part of the total farm force, and family farms are in no great difficulty. Large farmers say that there is no great shortageof labour but, as in France, complain that they have to make large allowances of fatand meat in order to keep their staffs together.73. The state of farm equipment and the position in regard to supplies of spare parts,fertilizers, fuel, etc., seem to be much the same as in France. There is more concernthan in France about seed supplies for next spring. Belgium depended on Hollandfor a proportion of her seed potatoes, on Germany for sugar-beet and on various foreigncountries for clover, lucerne and other seeds. The stock of sugar-beet seed is said to bevery small, and clover seed is meantime selling at about three times the British price.74. The only feeding stuff under full official control is rape cake, and this has been allocated to owners of pedigree herds. A quantity of milling offals will become avail-able with the reduction in the extraction rate of wheat, but apparently no decision hasbeen reached about the disposal of the material. Farmers of course are anxious thatfeeding stuffs imports should be resumed as soon as possible.ECONOMIC  CONDITIONS IN FRANCE  AND  BELGIUMI. In submitting the report of the Mission, which, on your instructions has been examining into the state of food, agriculture and nutrition in France, Belgium and holland, I should like to report also on the general economic situation in France andBelgium, which, while beyond the purview of the Mission, appears to have sufficientelements of danger to warrant immediate and serious attention. It is understood thatthe seriousness of the situation is recognized by the recently returned Supply Mission(under Sir Cecil Weir), which is referring to this question in part of its report.2. In France and Belgium to-day, economic life is practically at a standstill.Factories are idle and large numbers of workmen are unemployed, owing to the follow-ing causes:  (a) Owing to the wholesale damage to railways and waterways and the shortageof motor transport, the problem of feeding the cities is taxing the remainingtransport facilities to the full. Coal cannot yet be provided for industryowing to lack of both transport and pitprops. The French mines are workingonly three days a week, and the Belgium mines intermittently.(6) Even if coal could be mined and conveyed to the factories, the shortage of rawmaterials would be a most serious factor in the situation. Those greatindustries (textile, chemical, rubber, etc.) which depend on imports have now only two or three weeks stocks.   Under extreme military necessity, the few
ports which have not been wrecked are, by the decision of Supreme Head-quarters, closed to civilian imports. There appears to be no prospect of relief through Antwerp, Bordeaux or Havre for some little time yet. in belgium there is special cause for anxiety as the result of a partial producers&apos;strike among the farmers and difficulties among the mine workers, due in part to the financial reform which, however necessary it may be, has somewhatdisturbed the economic life.3. In fact, of the four primary needs of man food, clothing, warmth and work food is on a minimum basis owing to the lack of ports and to collection and distributiondifficulties in the countries concerned; stocks of clothing are small and there are practically no raw materials available; warmth is entirely lacking in the great cities and is unlikely to be provided in sufficient quantity for at least a large part of the winter; and work is largely stopped for lack of coal and raw materials. While the situation is improvingslowly as internal conditions recover, the lack of raw materials will have an increasinglybad effect.4. The dangers of this situation are obvious in countries only recently liberated,where the Governments are by no means firmly established and the Resistance Move-ment, in France at least, is in control of large areas. In spite of the intense hatred ofthe Germans, the people are not back in the war and now that the first excitement of release is over, it will need real leadership to make them accept the further severesacrifices which liberation has laid upon them. It is, of course, primarily the respon-sibility of the indigenous Governments to deal with the problem, but a situation which,if it develops, may not only jeopardise the permanent economic stability of thosecountries, but interfere with the military effort in the final stages of the war, must be amatter of concern to us also. Supreme Headquarters are doing their best to assist the indigenous Governments, but the greater part of France has now become a Zone of theInterior and in any case the problem is one which goes far beyond the military sphere.Time, however, is short. The situation may deteriorate rapidly and it is, in my view,urgent to review the situation as a whole and to do whatever may be possible to makeports available at the earliest possible dates and meanwhile to encourage and advise the indigenous Governments.R.
