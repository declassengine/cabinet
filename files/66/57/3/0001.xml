THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1944.Copy No.27th October, 1944.WAR CABINET.ARMISTICE TERMS FOR BULGARIA.Memorandum by the Minister of State.THE Foreign Secretary circulated on the 27th August (W.P. (44) 475) areport on the preparation of draft armistice terms for Bulgaria by the european advisory Commission.2. After the Soviet declaration of war on Bulgaria discussions were resumed in the Commission. The Soviet Representative put forward a number of amendments to the agreed Anglo-American terms. These amendments included a number of objectionable features, which the Soviet Representative was unwilling to modify, and the British and American Representatives were unwilling toaccept.   A deadlock, was thus reached.3. This deadlock was resolved as a result of the Foreign Secretary&apos;discussions with M. Molotov in Moscow. In the first place, the Soviet Govern-ment accepted our proposal that the withdrawal of Bulgarian forces and officials from Greek and Yugoslavian territory should be made a precondition to theopening of negotiations with the Bulgarians. A communication to this effect was accordingly agreed and despatched on the 11th October to the bulgarian government, who accepted it.4. The drafts of an Armistice and a supplementary Protocol were also agreed in Moscow between the Secretary of State and M. Molotov and telegraphedback to London for communication to Mr. Winant and for examination by theEuropean Advisory Commission. The Commission has now completed its workand has recommended to the three Governments texts which .are attached asAnnexes (A) and (B). These texts are identical in substance with the drafts&apos;agreed by the Secretary of State in Moscow and I have accordingly authorisedSir William Strang to inform his colleagues that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentapprove these texts. The terms have been communicated to the Yugoslav and greek Governments; and were presented to the Bulgarian delegation in moscow on. the 26th October.5. The Secretary of State reported that the Russians took a strong and very special interest in Bulgaria as a Slav country. They were determined that the bulgarians should not be treated more unfavourably than the Roumanians andHungarians and proved very difficult and obstinate in negotiating. In thecircumstances, the Secretary of State was satisfied that he had obtained all thatwas humanly possible. Whilst we conceded the Soviet claim that negotiationswith the Bulgarians should take place in Moscow and have not secured theinclusion of a general Article, on the strength of which further demands couldbe put forward at a later date, a substantial measure of satisfaction has been secured on a number of points, apart from the immediate evacuation of Greekterritory which was dur first desideratum. The Russians agreed to doublesignature and General Wilson is sending his Chief of Staff, General Gammell,to act as his representative for the negotiation and signature of the Armistice.The. Russians accepted our formula for the use of Bulgarian forces, which avoidsgiving the Bulgarians the status of co-belligerency. Provision for the eventualdemobilisation of the Bulgarian forces is included and the Protocol providesfor food supplies to Greece and Yugoslavia and covers all the needs of our representatives in Bulgaria.12549   [28485] &apos; bSECRET. \ /W.P.

6. Article 18, which deals with control machinery, was the subject of longand difficult negotiations. The Article as it how stands is a great improvement on the earlier Soviet draft. M. Molotov has stated, however, in a letter to theForeign Secretary that the direction of the Commission will still belong to theSoviet High Command once hostilities with Germany have ceased, though headmits that the leading role of the Soviet High Command during this period will to some extent be restricted by the presence of British and american representatives as members of the Commission. The United States Governmentand ourselves were anxious that during this later period the three governments should have an equal share in the work and responsibility of the Commission.The United States Government, though they have accepted the present draft,have stated that they may wish to reopen discussions about the application ofthis Article at some later date. I ani informing them in reply that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have taken note of their views and will be quite ready to discussthe matter.7. An understanding was reached with M. Molotov on two points which do not appear either in the Armistice or the Protocol. Both the United StatesGovernment and ourselves \vere anxious, to include in the Armistice a provisionfor the control of Bulgarian assets. The Soviet Government resisted this andM. Molotov stated in conversation, that. Marshal Stalin was responsible for thisdecision. The Foreign Secretary did not therefore pursue the point any,furtherbut he reserved the right to revert to it should it become clear that Bulgariav/as trying to hide her foreign assets. M. Molotov agreed that if this provedtb Be the case, the matter should be further discussed arid that the same should apply, to Roumariia and Finland.8. The second point is the provision of Bulgarian exports for this country.M. MblotOv agreed that the three. Allies must.be placed on an. equal, footing;and he therefore agreed to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal, that the soviet authorities in Bulgaria would support any Britishdemand for Bulgarianmaterials necessary for British war industry on the understanding, that he couldrely on our co-operation ih a similar case in favour of Soviet industry.R K LForeign Office, 27ih October, 1944.ANNEX A.Agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on theone hand, and the government of bulgaria on the other hankey),concerning an armistice.The Government of Bulgaria accept the armistice terms presented by theGovernments of the United Kingdom, the United States of America and theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics, acting on behalf of all the United nations at war with Bulgaria.Accordingly, ,the representative of the Soviet High Command, General...................., and the representative of the Supreme-Allied Command , in theMediterranean, General .........duly authorised thereto by, the, Governrments of the.United Kingdom, the United States of America and the Union of soviet Socialist.
