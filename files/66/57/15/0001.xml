(44) 615.2nd November, 1944.WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES FOR THE CHANNEL ISLANDSMemorandum by the Home Secretary.AT their meeting on the 23rd October (W.M. (44) 140th Conclusions,Minute 12) the War Cabinet decided to defer until the 6th November the question,of sending supplies to the Channel Islands.Information has been received during the past week, from documents carried by persons who escaped from Jersey during October, about conditions in Jerseyon the 8th October and about conditions in Guernsey on the 31st August. Theinformation in these documents about the food situation has been analysed anda report by Dr. Magee of the Ministry of Health is annexed. It will be seen thatthe information is not sufficient to permit of firm conclusions, but that the tenta-tive opinion is expressed that while there may be some lack of food, speciallyamong those who cannot buy from the black market, the Islanders can probablycarry on for a few weeks longer, but that there is a substantial danger of unduesuffering from epidemics aggravated by a serious shortage of medicines and soap.Apart from these technical views on the inadequacy of present food stocks,it is clear that there, is very substantial hardship arising from shortage of allcommodities, particularly of fuel and clothing. In Jersey, there is no gas orcoal, there is a very occasional and inadequate ration of green wood, and electricityis cut off from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. daily and often for a period during evening.In Guernsey there is no household fuel apart from small supplies of local wood,most of which are being reserved for essential institutions, bakeries, and whengas fails, for communal cooking centres. In the latter event schemes have beenmade for using gorse and bracken.The general picture of life in Jersey is described in the letter from theJersey Controller of Labour, which has been circulated to the War Cabinet bythe Minister of Labour (W.P. (44) 610). This letter, and other documents,indicates how low the standard of life has fallen and how near the people,particularly the poorer section of the population, are to breaking point.The War Cabinet should also know that from an intercepted letter froma resident of Jersey to a relative in the United Kingdom, carried by one of thepersons who recently escaped, it appears to be common knowledge in Jersey,and will now be known in this country, that the German Commander has referred the question of civilian food supplies to the German Government, presumablyby radio, and that the German Government informed a neutral Power. Thereis consequently much rumour in Jersey of Red Cross parcels.The opinion has already been expressed by the Chiefs of Staff on the25th September that, as under conditions at that time the Islands had no military importance and British civilians were involved, we should accept theGerman offer that food be imported by Red Cross ships. I need hardly remindmy colleagues that we have not unlimited time to come to the relief of our fellow-countrymen. The longer we wait the greater will be the privations of our fellow-countrymen which may have permanent ill effects, and, if we have to wait until[28522]
the German Commander surrenders, our people may be brought to the verge ofstarvation. The German Commander is not likely to surrender merely to saveour people from suffering.*[ hope my colleagues will agree that the time has now come to put arrange-ments in hand at once for the dispatch by Red Cross ship of the supplies whichare being held in readiness.H. M.Home Office, S. W: 1,2nd November, 1944.ANNEX.CHANNEL ISLANDS.Report by Dr. Magee.FROM study of letters written between the 4th and 9th October, 1944, by persons residing in Jersey I am inclined on the whole to the opinion that thereprobably exists in Guernsey, at any rate, some lack of food, especially amongstthose who cannot participate in the black market, but that the Islanders could probably carry on for a few weeks longer. - This should be taken only as an expression of opinion because, as I have indicated below, the data available- are insufficient to enable me to come to a definite conclusion. There is evidence inthese and other papers of a serious shortage of medicines, particularly ofanaesthetics. This shortage would, of course, affect only a relatively, small proportion of the population, but the sufferings of those would be correspndinglyincreased. If epidemic disease were to occur, then a relatively high death rate would be likely by reason of the shortage of food, as well as of medicines.In what follows I review the evidence presented by these papers.A.- The extracts from the letters of the 4th and 9th October from &quot; E &quot;and &quot; Ma and Dad,&quot; after filling up certain obvious gaps, e.g., for vegetablesand fruit, show considerable agreement as to the quantities of the rations avail-able. Altogether these quantities of food would provide about 1,500 caloriesper head daily. This level of consumption is insufficient in winter, particularly with little or no fuel available. If consumption at this level were to continue,there would be hunger, considerable loss of weight and of energy, inside a month.B. The letter from the Controller of Labour in Jersey to Mr. Bevin on thewhole supports the evidence contained in the intercepts. The important questionthen is &quot; How long it is likely that the population of Guernsey would have to live at the level of 1,500 calories per head daily ?C. The letter from Mr. Sarre (the representative of the States of Guernseyin Jersey) goes some way to supplying an answer. If the information he givesof bulk food supplies in Guernsey on the 31st August, 1944, is accurate,Guernsey could last for six weeks at the level of 1,500 calories per day. this level, as I have pointed out under &quot;A,&quot; would result before the end of thisperiod in hunger, loss of weight and physical efficiency. Either this date isincorrect or the list of foods is an understatement, otherwise the statement on health in Mr. Sarre&apos;s letter would have been in much blacker colours. On thewhole, I am of opinion that the list of foods he gives is an understatement.Mr. Sarre, for example, mentions that the Germans have shipped 360 tons ofwheat to Guernsey from Jersey. This. obviously was not taken into account inthe list of foods. If it were, the period of subsistence at the 1,500 calorie level would be increased from about six weeks to nearly 2\ months, i.e., to mid-November. But, as the diet would necessarily contain much larger proportions of bread, it would be correspondingly ill-balanced, and deficiency diseases wouldbe likely to occur, particularly in children. There is, however, no evidence toindicate how long and in what amount wheat from Jersey could be sent toGuernsey. Without this information it is clearly impossible to say how longJersey, as well as Guernsey, could hold out.Both Mr. Sarre&apos;s letter and the Intercept from &quot;Ma and Dad&quot; go to confirm the opinion I have previously expressed that the food supplies in Jerseyare not really bad. For instance, &quot; Ma and Dad &quot; say : &quot; All things considered,we are quite comfortable.&quot; On the other hand, the letter in W.P. (44) 610suggests that poor people who cannot buy in the black market may be none toowell off for food.
Mr. Sarre, in his letter, says that &quot; There are many cases of infantilediarrhoea, sores failing to heal up and general malnutrition among children and the elderly.&quot; &quot; General malnutrition&quot; is a loose term and little attentionneed be paid to it, but diarrhoea and sores which fail to heal may be of greatersignificance. These conditions may be due to straightforward bacterial infectionand be little related to food or, on the other hand, they may be evidence ofinsufficient food or of unsuitable food or both. Probably both the bacterial andthe nutritional factors play a part in causing these conditions. &apos; The prevalence of stealing amongst the garrison supports the view that there is some real lackof sufficient food.(Signed) H. E. MAGEE.Ministry of Health, Whitehall, S.W. 1,31st October, 1944.   &apos;
