(U-U) 612jh   1ST; NOVEMBER, 19^   - : - &apos; / k1- D ^WAR CABINETPOLANDNote &quot;by the secretary by direction of the Prime Minister the attached, record of a conversation between the Polish Foreign Minister and Sir A.,Cadoganis circulated for consideration by the &quot;.7a r Cabinet.(Signed)    E.E,  BRIDGESOffices of the War Cabinet,  S.W.I.,1st November, 19 bah..Record of a conversation between the Polish Foreign Ministerand Sir A.  Cadogan on ;51ct October,  194^The Polisdi Foreign Minister called on me this morning accompaniedby the.Polish Ambassador to report on the proceedings in the PolishCabinet yesterday evening.      Apparently no conclusion of any kind wasreached and M. Romer told me that if M. Mikolajczyk had&apos;pressed for adecision it would certainly have been unfavourable.      The Cabinet had therefore adjourned until tomorrow.M. Romer assured me that M. MikQlajczyk and he had put&apos;the case as fairly as they could to their colleagues and they had not refraineufrom stressing the great dangers &quot;that would threaten their country ifthey failed now to reach an agreement with the Soviet Government.He said that of course the Great Powers could impose the curzon line on Poland and Poland would be powerless to resist.      But that we-not the position.      The Great Powers had asked Poland to accept thatLine and.if they set value on the consent to the Polish Government he-submitted that they must facilitate the giving of that consent..  There were three questions which he wanted to put to  isMajesty&apos;s Government.    &quot; If favourable answers coulc be given to these,he thought it might facilitate the decision by the Polish Government.In the firstgplace, with recollections of what happened in 1919,the Polish Government had misgivings about the attitude of the UnitedStates.      They were afraid that the United States in the end might not.agree to the compensation which Poland had been promised in.the west. -Poland -was asked now definitely to renounce a great part of her territory&apos; in the east and she only had promises of compensation.    Itas true&apos; that the Prime Minister and Marshal Stalin had been quiteexplicit on this point at the recent Moscow conversationsy but the -first Question which M. Romer wished to put was whether the attitudeof His Majesty&apos;s Government was so decided on this question that eventhough the United States might not agree to the changes on the west-em frontier of Poland, Mis Majesty&apos;s Government would still consider themselves bound to advocate these at  the Peace Settlement.      Hesuggested that if Mis Majesty&apos;a Government could not give a clearanswer to these questions how&apos;  it might be better to leave the wholeSoviet-Polish question open until the projected meeting of the three

M. Romer1s second question related to the suggestion that polishterritory after the&apos;war should he advanced up to the line of the   Oder,nn this point Marshal Stalin had been very explicit,;saying that he recognised the&apos; Polish claim to this territory,  including the port ofqtettin.      The Prime Minister, had agreed with this, hut the foreign secretary had recalled the decision reached at the Teheran Conference*hnt the Polish Government might he allowed to advance their frontieriathis direction as far as they thought desirable.      M. Homer saidthat this would throw the responsibility of the frontier change inthis region on to the Polish Government and might be the cause of difficulty for them in the future.      Mr. Eden had also hinted that a too^far-reaching change of the frontier in this area might, if it becamevnovm, stiffen German resistance.    If it were merely a question of publicity, M. Eomer thought that this point could be covered       But theQuestion which he put was whether the policy of His Majesty1s Govern-inent was definitely in favour of extending the Polish frontier up tothe line of the Oder.        If there was to be a clear definition of thepolish losses in the east, there should be an equally clear definition of the gains they were going to receive in compensation in the west.The Polish Government were only too anxious to have the best possiblerelatious with the Soviet, but if the Curzou Line were to be imposedupon Poland without adequate compensation, he feared - there would never,be any hope of lasting good relations.His third point related to the question of Polish independence inthe future.      In this connexion he referred to various symptoms indic-ative of the Soviet attitude,  quoting Russian activities in northernIran;    the refusal of the Soviet Government to attend the Civil Aviatior-Conference, anO the latitude given to the Polish National Committee wheyesterday put out a demand for the abandonment of the Constitution of1935 and the removal of the President of Poland.M. Romer recalled that at his recent meeting with M. Mikolajczykthe Prime Minister had said that it would be essential that he shouldcommand a majority in any Polish Government which he might be able toform.      M. Romer very much feared that M.  Mikolajczyk, if he returned to moscow now., would be unable to achieve this object.      The SovietGovernment heel always claimed that Poland must first have the curzon line and then discuss other matters.      He felt that M. Mikolajczyk,  indealing alone with Marshal Stalin, would be at the latter&apos;s mercy.Consequently, M.  Romer put his third question:    will His Majesty&apos;sGovernment guarantee&apos; the independence and integrity of the new Poland?He referred to the Prime Minister&apos;s recent reply to a question in theHouse of Commons which said In general terms that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-mettt would share in a guarantee, but he recalled that in the conver-s;:.tions in Moscow the Foreign Secretary had said that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could not accept fresh commitments.    M. Mikolajczyk there-fore wished to be quite clear as to the length &apos; His    Majesty&apos;sGovernment would go either in participating in a joint guarantee ofPoland or in inserting suitable provisions in the Treaty of alliance with Poland which would, before long, become due for renewal.I told M. Romer that of course I would submit what he had said tothe Prime Minister.      I could of course myself give him no answers tothe questions which he had put, but I would make one observation andthat was, as I had indicated to&apos; him last week,  that these delays were extremely dangerous.      In the course of his statement, M. Romer had suggested that the whole question might be left open until the meetingor the three Heads of Governments.      I had no idea when that might takePlace, but of course it obviously could not take place in the nearjpvtur-e, and if we were to wait for that the delay would be inordinate^-u disastrous.      I fully understood all the difficulties of the Polishgovernment ana I realised the dilemma in which they were placed.      It   :-t,emed to me that they were trying to make a certainty of every point,vnereas plainly they must be prepared to ac ept a certain amount of1 -LoK:. \

To reinforce the warning that I had given toMi  Roivier of the danger of delay.,  I told him, that wehad just heard that the Soviet Government weredemanding the admission of the Polish national committee to representation in the European inland transport. Conference.      I said that we should not contemplate this, but it was an indication of the-way in which things were moving and showed that whtwith every day\s delay there was increased dangerof something irrevocable &quot;being done.(Signed)    A.
