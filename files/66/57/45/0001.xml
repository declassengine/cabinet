Copy No.W.P. (44) 645.13th November, 1944.WAR CABINET.PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS OF THE FOUR MAIN political parties FOR THE IMPENDING GENERAL ELECTION.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues a document preparedby the Chief Agents of the four main Political Parties containing a series of requests regarded by them as necessary to meet their minimum personnel require-ments for the impending General Election. Some of the requests are not myconcern and I leave these to be dealt with by my colleagues.2. I regard paragraph 2, concerning candidates, as reasonable. As regardsparagraph 3, I could not agree to the release of &apos;&apos; persons to be appointed &apos;&apos; tothe posts of agents and organisers; this would be open to abuse and could not,in my view, be justified. The term &quot; Organisers &quot; would also have to be closelydefined. Also I am not altogether satisfied with paragraph 4 such persons should not in any case be released from the Forces.E. B.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,13ih November, 1944.&apos; ANNEX.Requests of Chief Agents of the Four Main Political Parties.1. In order to enable electors at a General Election to be properly andadequately, informed as to the programmes and policies of the respective parties,the Chief Agents of the four main political parties put forward the followingrequests as necessary to meet their minimum personnel requirements. They are based on the assumption that a General Election would take place fairly soon after the cessation of hostilities in Europe.Candidates.2. At present serving members of the Forces at home or abroad are at a disadvantage in being unable to attend selection committees. It is suggestedthat subject to overriding military considerations, short special leave (e.g., a fortnight) should be granted to enable properly proposed and endorsed potentialcandidates to appear personally before the election committee of their prospectiveconstituency.Temporary release from the Forces of adopted candidates in adequate time before the election is essential.Full-time Agents, Organisers and Officials.3. The early release is necessary of full-time men and women agents andorganisers, or of persons to be appointed to those posts, and the key staff ofHeadquarters and Regional Party Offices who are at present in the Forces, in national Service, or employed in Industry, but subject, in the case of membersof the Forces, to overriding military considerations.[28593]
Application for the release of men and women under the provisions of thisparagraph shall be made in every case by the Headquarters of the political parties concerned.-&apos; &quot; Jn the event, however, of an election taking place before or immediatelyafter the termination of hostilities in Europe, ad hoc arrangements would benecessary for the immediate temporary release of any agents, organisers qrofficials who were still retained in the Forces.Partly Paid and Unpaid Agents in Elections.4. The conditions applying to the release of full-time agents, organisersand officials should be applied to these Officers. A number of political parties,depend very largely on partly-paid and unpaid agents to organise and to conductelections.The Indian A rmy.5. Officers and men temporarily serving in the Indian Army arising outof war conditions, onght to be given the same facilities as Officers and men serving in the British Army, both in respect of Parliamentary candidatures andemployment as Agents.Temporary Civil Servants.6. Consideration should be given to men and women employed as temporaryCivil Servants who desire to submit themselves to Selection Committees asParliamentary Candidates. The present regulations vary a great deal in their application. Some temporary Civil Servants are permitted to take up Parlia-mentary candidatures whereas others are called upon to resign their posts.
