It   is   issued   for   the personal use ofVCopy No.   3 war CABINETPRISONERS OF WAR IN SIAMMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR war on 31st October I announced in the House of Commons that some 150 survivorsfrom a sunk Japanese transport carrying United Kingdom and Australian prisoners ofwar from Singapore to Japan had been rescued by United States naval forces inSeptember. The Australians were sent straight home from a United States Pacificnaval base and the Australian Government have been collecting and collating theinformation obtained from them as to their treatment while in Japanese hands. Asummary of this information has been received from Australia and we have also hadthe text of a draft statement which has been submitted by the Service authorities and intended for release by the Prime Minister in Australia simultaneously with an announce-ment in the United Kingdom. A copy of this draft is at Appendix A. It hadbeen agreed that no statement should be made by either Government without consulta-tion with the other.The United Kingdom survivors reached a rest camp in this country at the end oflast week. During their journey home they were interrogated while at Pearl harbour and notes of these interrogations have been received. They have also been interrogatedwhile in camp here prior to going on leave last Monday morning. The combinedresults of the examinations of the United Kingdom survivors are being collated, but itis already clear that their stories confirm the Australian account of the treatment ofprisoners by the Japanese in the southern area.Being under the impression that the Australian Government were desirous of issuingtheir statement at a very early date in view of the length of time since the Australiansurvivors arrived home, the Departments concerned prepared for me a statement to bemade in the House of Commons on Tuesday, 14th, and at the same time it was proposedto circulate to the House, as a statement by the Australian Government, the statement in Appendix A, with any amendments that might be received. The Australian Govern-ment were informed of our intentions, but have asked that our statement should be deferred because they are not yet ready to make their statement. The United StatesGovernment, who were also notified, have expressed concern, as they fear it may affectan exchange of nationals which they have proposed to the Japanese. It is understood from the Embassy here that they consider a previous exchange negotiation was con-siderably delayed by the statements on Japanese ill-treatment of prisoners, which weremade in January of this year.   Copies of relevant telegrams are at Appendix B.The statement I had proposed to make is at Appendix C.The United Kingdom prisoners have now gone home and, although they have been warned not to talk to the Press, and editors have been asked by the Ministry of Informa-tion not to publish stories, there is little doubt in my mind that news of the ill-treatmentthey have received will leak out quickly and I feel that it is essential to make some statement to the House of Commons before it rises on Friday. This view has been represented to the Australian and United States^Governments and I understand theAustralian Cabinet are considering the matter on Wednesday.In view of the need for further exchange of views on the subject with the australian and United States Governments, I would propose to confine the statement to the Houseof Commons this week to a narrative of the bare facts without any comment on theaction of the Japanese authorities. A further statement will then be made when thecollation of all the information, including that of the Australian Government, is complete,and at this stage it may have been possible to obtain agreement to the comments whichare now excluded.   The form of the revised statement is at Appendix D.P. J. G.The War Office,14th November, 1944.
APPENDIX AsDRAFT AUSTRALIAN  STATEMENTAll but one of the 92 Australians who were rescued by United States submarinesfrom a Japanese transport which had been torpedoed on 12th September, 1944, in theWestern Pacific Ocean had now arrived in Australia. As the result of the skilled atten-tion given to them overseas after their rescue and immediately on their arrival inAustralia the men generally are in good physical condition and with few exceptionsare now on leave.These men were among approximately 700 Australians who, with approximately600 British prisoners of war, had been embarked in a Japanese ship at Singapore on 4th September for transfer to Japan.The accommodation provided for 1,300 men consisted of a space in the ship&apos;second hold. This space, which carried a sign reading &quot; Accommodation for 187steerage passengers &quot;, had been horizontally sub-divided by a false floor. Thus theJapanese created the two decks neither of which had a ceiling height in excess of fourfeet. The Japanese orders were that all prisoners of war should be confined below deck,and this meant that in the sub-divided hold each man was allotted a space of only twosquare feet. Men had just enough room to sit up. When they wanted to sleep theyhad to rest on one another. Their bedding was their own personal clothing and oneblanket usually of poor cotton material. The air below was fetid and stiflingly hot,as port holes were sealed and the only ventilation was through the hatch. The Japanesecommander refused to permit erection of wind sails which were found in the hold andwhich would have provided some slight relief for men below.Because of the physical impossibility of cramming all 1,300 men into the hold theJapanese commander was forced to agree to several hundred men sleeping and livingon deck, together with sick men who had to be brought up for air and treatment by two Australian doctors who accompanied them. As many as 100 men at a time wereill and as the price they paid tor fresh air they had to remain exposed throughout theday to tropical sun and at night slept on the bare deck with only one thin blanket forcovering.The sufferings of the men were intensified by a shortage of drinking water. Therice ration, and often stew, was cooked with salt water and this made prisoners eventhirstier. Despite this shortage, Japanese guards freely used fresh water to wash them-selves and did so in view of the prisoners. The food ration for each man consisted ofthree-quarters of a pannikin of rice three times a day, with an added spoonful of sugarin the morning and a small tin of watery fish stew at night.Whilst in an escorted convoy, the ship, with other Japanese vessels, was torpedoedabout 5.30 a.m. on 12th September, in a calm sea. The Japanese panicked, most of themhurriedly left in ship&apos;s lifeboats but others jumped overboard. None displayed the slightest interest in the fate of the prisoners of war. In the darkness Australians andBritish, under direction of their officers, effected an orderly evacuation of the ship.They went overboard progressively after they had thrown into sea all rafts and woodenarticles that would float.About 75 per cent, of the men had lifebelts. The Japanese had also issued to eachprisoner a block of crude rubber for use as a lifebuoy. It was found that these wouldnot float.The men had been in the sea for only a short time when the Japanese destroyerescort dropped depth charges in a counter attack against United States submarine.Unfortunately the explosion of depth charges affected many men in the sea, greatlyreducing their chance of survival. The Japanese destroyer then put out boats to rescuethe Japanese on rafts, but they refused to pick up any prisoners.The Japanese, after rescuing their own nationals, waved, derisively at Australians.The latter, who had then been in the water for some hours, showed their magnificentspirit by singing &quot; Rule Britannia &quot;. The evidence given by the rescued men make sit clear beyond all doubt that Japanese intended to leave all prisoners of war to drown.During the first day there were repeated attempts to organize rafts into groups.Men swam from one raft to another seeking friends. Groups of Australians gatheredtogether for mutual assistance. During the first night the men were mainly in largeparties. On the second, third and fourth days many men, including those affected bydepth charges, were lost from rafts most of which were very slippery owing to theirbecoming coated with oil from a sunken Japanese tanker.Between the afternoon of the fourth day and the evening of the sixth day the survivors were rescued by American submarines, the commanding officers and crews of which showed great skill and courage in their conduct of the rescue operations.The Australians who had been rescued felt they could never praise too highlythe treatment which they had received aboard the United States submarines after theywere rescued. They were then in an emaciated and often semi-delirious conditionhaving spent days in the sea without food, water and in many cases without clothing.
On the submarines the rescued men were washed free of black oil which coveredthem, wrapped in blankets, giving every medical attention and nourishment. They saythat officers and crews acted as mothers and sisters to them. The submarine crews asthey came off duty spent the whole of their rest period cooking food, feeding, shavingand washing the survivors and gave them complete outfits of clothing. The pharmacistmates on all vessels worked almost without sleep for days.At an advanced Island base at Guadalcanal and on United States ships whichbrought the Australians home the utmost attention and kindness was bestowed upon the survivors.After the men had been accommodated at a Convalescent Home in Australiaopportunity was taken to have them compile lists of their comrades who had been onboard the sunken transport and also to obtain a first hand story of how the japanese have treated Allied prisoners of war.The rescued men were part of a force of Australian prisoners of war transported inMay, 1942, from Singapore and Java to various. parts of Burma under the same conditions as existed on the transport which was sunk.After employment in Burma, mainly on aerodrome construction, the Australianswere transferred to a camp at Thanbyuazat at the Northern end of the projected Burma-Thailand railway. B3/ October, 1942, thousands of Australians and other allied prisoners of war were at work in the jungle. At intervals of several months they were transferred to camps deeper into the jungle as the railway progressed.The men in the jungle camps lived in bamboo huts thatched with palm leaves.Many slept on bamboo tier floors but in some camps where there were no floors the men.improvized beds out of bags and bamboo poles to keep away from lice and bugs.Each man had only one flimsy blanket. From April to October in 1943, tropical rainspenetrated the roofs and turned the camps and hut floors into a sea of mud. Clothingdeteriorated, no issues were made by the Japanese, many of the men wore only a loincloth sometimes with one other garment. Boots were worn out and not replaced. Manylived and worked without boots for months. Food consisted of a pannikin of rice and about half a pint of watery stew three times a day. Endeavours were made to supple-men t the ration with native foods and edible roots. The issue of soap was one smallpiece about every six months.Each day there was usually a sick parade held by an Australian Medical Officerbut if it resulted in an insufficient number of men for the work a Japanese doctor wouldmake a casual inspection of the sick and order to work all men who had no visibledisease. Often men with very high temperatures would be forced to work. Australiandoctors did their utmost for the sick men but owing to absence of drugs and facilitiessickness and deaths were inevitable. Main causes of death were malnutrition, dysentry,malaria and exhaustion and in some places cholera.Hospital cases had to be accommodated at each camp until after lengthy delaysthey were evacuated to a base camp at Thanbyuazat. The hospital was similar to thework camps but more strongly constructed. Rations were somewhat better becausenative supplies were obtained. Allied surgeons used mainly improvized instruments.Only local anaesthetics were available even for the removal of limbs. Large numbersof the patients had tropical ulcers often from the knee to the foot. Many such caseshad a leg removed and a large percentage died.Actual work on the railway consisted of cutting through virgin forest, levelling atrack, making embankments and cuttings, building bridges, and finally laying andballasting the track.   Prisoners of war were also employed in the ballast quarries.All work was done with crude tools and involved a maximum of physical effort.As camp strengths diminished owing to deaths and illness the remaining men had towork longer hours. Shifts thus increased from 12 to 18 hours a day, sometimes exceeding&quot;24 hours of continuous work. Work through the night was done by the light of lampsand torches.  Meals were brought out by semi-fit men.   Work continued in all weather.Each camp had a Japanese officer or serjeant in charge with about 30 guards whosupervized the work. The guards maltreated the prisoners of war at the slightestpretext, bashings usually were heavy blows on the head, sufficient to knock the prisoner of war over. Another punishment was to make a prisoner of war stand holding a heavypiece of wood above his head for two to five hours. Sometimes prisoners of war weremade to stand to attention for several days. The guards who were Koreans almostinvariably behaved with utmost brutality having learnt their lesson from the way theJapanese had treated them.When the line was completed in October, 1943, the prisoners of war who hadconstructed it were withdrawn through its Southern terminus and were accomodated in Thailand. Some were transferred to Indo-China. It was from one party of thesethat a selection was made of the fittest for transfer to Japan. The men recently rescuedbelonged to this group.There is much more that could be said of the Japanese treatment of prisoners ofwar in many other prison camps occupied at one time or another by Australians but:(19944) a 2
it mostly follows the same pattern of underfeeding, maltreatment and neglect of ourmen.   Conditions in camps in populated areas are not as bad as those in the jungle.By their dauntless courage and amazing endurance the survivors from the Japanesetransport have performed a great service. They have given eye-witness account ofthe manner in which Japanese treat their prisoners of war, they have managed tocompile an almost complete list of their comrades who were shipped with them andthey have furnished long -lists of names of Australians who have died in the jungle and elsewhere and of whose deaths the Japanese Government has not notified the Common-wealth.The careful collation and checking of all this vast amount of information will takea considerable time but priority has been given to the preparation of lists of men whowere not rescued from the sunken transport in order that their next-of-kin may beinformed. As to the fate of the 600 men not known to be rescued from the Japanesetransport it would appear that the chances of survival of any of them would depend upon their being able to reach land. The chance was a very slender one, but it is just possible that some may be alive  Only time can provide the answer.The task of examining and checking survivors&apos; lists of casualties in Burma andThailand and Malaya will be proceeded with immediately and next of kin will be notifiedat the earliest practicable date.Whilst all this work is receiving attention, relatives of Australian prisoners of war are especially asked to refrain from making any effort to contact or question rescuedmen who have returned to their homes. These men have been through harrowingexperiences, have splendidly co-operated with service authorities during a lengthyinterrogation, and now richly deserve a peaceful and uninterrupted reunion with their families.It is deeply regretted that at this stage it cannot be stated how many Australianshave died. : An early estimate places the death roll in Burma and Thailand at about,000 out of approximately 10,000 Australians. It is hoped that this estimate will provetoo high, but unfortunately it may ultimately prove to be an understatement.It is felt that this information should be given publicity, even though the Govern-ment is profoundly aware of the anguish it will cause to families of all Australianscaptured by the Japanese. It was considered that the next-of-kin should receive an authoritative statement based on facts, rather than hear distorted versions based onrumours.When they made plans involving the sacrifice of thousands of Allied prisoners of war on the construction of the Burma-Thailand railway the Japanese imagined that theywould win the war; they therefore thought that they would never be brought to account.They will pay for that miscalculation.All who have been rescued speak of the high courage shown by their prisonercomrades everywhere and in all circumstances the Australians have maintained match-less morale. They have shown themselves undaunted in face of death. The many who have survived privations and disease in the jungle have developed a spiritual powerto triumph over adversity and over their captors.The people of Australia share sorrow and pride of their kith and kin who are grievedby these sad events.

APPENDIX CDRAFT statement as the House was told on 31st October, some 150 survivors from a sunk Japanese transportcarrying U.K. and Australian prisoners of war from Singapore to Japan were rescued by united States submarines in September. The Australian survivors were sent straight home from a United States Pacific Naval Base, and the Australian Government has therefore had time to collect and collate their stories. A summary of the information obtained from them has just been issued by the Australian Government and copies of it are available for members in the Vote Office. The survivors from the United Kingdom have only reached this countrywithin the last few days, and it has not been possible yet to collate the whole of theinformation which they have given us. This is being done as rapidly as possible, and I hope to make a further statement at an early date.The result of the preliminary examinations of these men on the way home, togetherwith the account sent to us by the Australian Government, gives us at least a first-handaccount of the way our men have been treated in the Southern Areas of the Far East; andthere is now no longer any doubt about the policy pursued by the Japanese Authoritiestowards prisoners of war in these areas, which include Burma, Siam, Malaya and the east indies. I should make it clear at once that this information does not relate to Hong Kong,Formosa, Occupied China, Korea or Japan, where we believe present conditions to be relatively tolerable.All available prisoners in Singapore and Java appear to have been moved early in 1942to Burma or Siam. The Australians were sent by sea to Burma, crowded into ships&apos; holdswhich had been horizontally sub-divided so that ceilings were no more than 4 feet high.The prisoners from the United Kingdom were sent by rail to Siam, so crowded into trucksthat they could not even lie down during the journey. They were then marched some80 miles. This and subsequent movement in Burma or Siam appears to have been on foot,regardless of distance, weather, or the prisoners&apos; state of health. They were then set to workon the construction of a railway through primitive, disease-infested jungle passing over the mountain range between Siarn and Burma to meet the Burmese end of the railway, on theconstruction of which Australians were engaged. The conditions under which all these menlived and worked were terrible, even for natives of the country who were also forciblyemployed on the same work.Such accommodation as was provided gave little or no protection against tropical rainsor blazing sun ; worn out clothing was not replaced ; soon many lacked clothing, boots andhead covering; the only food provided was a pannikin of rice and about half a pint or less of watery stew three times a day. But the work had to go on without respite whatever thecost in human suffering or life. The inevitable result was a dreadful death-rate ; one point was known to the British prisoners as 600 Bridge, because 600 white men died and wereburied there. The lowest estimate of deaths is 20 per cent, out of perhaps 60,000 BritishCommonwealth prisoners, and the truth is likely to be worse than this. When the railwaywas finished about October, 1943, those not needed for maintenance work were moved tocamps in Siam where conditions were somewhat alleviated; from there the fittest were thensent temporarily to French Indo-China, and later to Singapore en route to Japan.The rescued men were on a ship, which left Singapore early in September, 1944. Therewere probably 1,300 U.K. and Australian prisoners on board. After she was sunk, theJapanese deliberately picked up all Japanese survivors but left the prisoners to their fate,and I fear that the great majority of them were drowned. I am sure I speak for the wholeHouse and for all the British people in expressing admiration for the way in which the UnitedStates submarine crews risked their own safety to rescue men from the sea, and our verydeep gratitude to those crews and to the United States authorities for the care and attentiongiven to them at every stage. Thanks to them nearly all the rescued men are now recoveringfrom their terrible experiences.We shall, of course, ask the Protecting Power to make the strongest possible protest.There is one redeeming feature in the whole story. All the rescued men tell of the amazingway in which the morale of the prisoners has remained high, despite the worst the Japanesecould do. In particular, tribute is paid to the medical officers who were captured with themand who have achieved little short of miracles in looking after the sick and the injureddespite lack of essential medicines, instruments, and hospital equipment. All that we havelearnt from these men reveals that our prisoners have been true to the highest traditions ofour race.To the relatives and friends of all the prisoners concerned our deepest sympathy goesout. It is a matter of profound regret to me that these disclosures have to be made ; butv/e are convinced that it is necessary that the Japanese should know that we know how theyare behaving and that we intend to hold them responsible. Here I would add that we arecollecting from the survivors every scrap of information they can give about other men,and this information will be passed on to the next-of-kin concerned as quickly as possible.The story these men have told gives the lie direct to the Japanese denial of the state-ment my right honourable Friend, the Foreign Secretary, made to the House on the
28th January last, regarding the conditions under which prisoners were being accommodatedand worked in Burma and Siam. It also proves that we were right in suspecting that thereason the Japanese have never permitted camps in these areas to be inspected by representatives of the Protecting Power or the I.R.C.C. was that they dared not let the truthabout them be known. By the conduct of their military authorities in these areas towardsdefenceless men who, by every standard of civilized conduct, were entitled to be treatedhonourably and decently, they have revealed themselves as being no better than primitivebarbarians. The whole world now knows what to expect from Japanese militarism when itbelieves its actions to be hidden from sight. I need hardly say that we shall hold responsibleall those who have behaved so infamously.This fresh, direct and unimpeachable evidence of the outrageous treatment of defencelessprisoners of war is, if it is required, an added reason why, when the German war is ended,there must be no relaxation in our efforts until, in concert with our Allies, we have completely destroyed this vile military tyranny which is the present day Japan.

The survivors from the UnitedKingdom have now reached this country.The result of preliminary examinations of the men gives at last a first-hand account ofthe way our men were treated in the Southern Areas of the Far East; and there is now nolonger any doubt about the policy which was pursued by the Japanese military authoritiestowards prisoners of war in these areas, which include Burma, Siam, Malaya and theEast Indies. I should make it clear at once that this information does not relate to hong Kong, Formosa, Occupied China, Korea or Japan, where we believe present conditions to be relatively tolerable.   Nor does it refer to civilian internees.The great majority of prisoners in Singapore and Java appear to have been moved earlyin 1942 to Burma or Siam.

The U.K. prisoners were thenset to work on the construction of a railway through primitive, disease-infested junglepassing over the mountain range between Siani and Burma to meet the Burmese end of therailway, on the construction of which Australians were engaged in similar country. Theconditions under which all these men lived and worked were terrible, even for natives of thecountry who were also forcibly employed on the same work.Such accommodation as was provided gave little or no protection against tropical rainsor blazing sun ; worn out clothing was not replaced ; soon many lacked clothing, boots andhead covering; the only food provided was a pannikin of rice and about half a pint or less of watery stew-three times a day. But the work had to go on without respite whatever thecost in human suffering or life. The inevitable result was an appalling death-rate, the lowestestimate of deaths being one in five. When the railway was finished about October, 1943,those not needed for maintenance work were moved to camps in Siam out of the jungle and here conditions are less intolerable. From these camps the fittest were later sent to singapore en route to Japan.The rescued men were on a ship, which left Singapore early in September, 1944.
