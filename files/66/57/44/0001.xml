It   is   issued   for   the personal use of/U-C- Uj&amp;J &amp;^**a-**.........................Copy No.36WAR CABINETSHORT LEAVE FOR THE ARMY OVERSEASMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARThe War Cabinet are aware of the increasing pressure, both in Parliament and inthe Press, for the posting to the home establishment of men who have had long con-tinuous service overseas with the Army. The more favourable conditions enjoyed bythe other two fighting Services in this respect are constantly being used as an argumentto induce me to shorten the overseas tour of service in the Army.A good deal has already been achieved in this direction, and I told the House ofCommons on 26th September that I counted on reducing the Army tour in India andSouth-East Asia Command by January next to four years, and elsewhere overseas to4! years. But the man-power position in the Army does not permit any hope of ageneral reduction of the overseas tour appreciably below those figures, and I am, there-fore, bound to consider whether there is any other way open to me of lightening this burden, both to the troops overseas, and to their families at home who have not seenthem for so long.In the course of my Mediterranean tour a few weeks ago, General Wuson andGeneral Alexander impressed upon mer^ehc^Tnar^)iefr1&amp;iSt some system of home leavewas essential to the maintenance of the morale of the troops in the Italian theatre, wherethe fighting in recent months has been bitter and undertaken in the most adverse climate conditions. The Commanders-in-Chief in the more distant theatres share this view: theproblem of maintaining the troops&apos; morale in the Far East is, as my colleagues know,a present preoccupation of urgency, and in the Middle East and P.A.T.C. though thereis no fighting at the moment in these theatres there are formations and units who have very recently been engaged in the battles in Italy. Again, recently, General Wilson hasreiterated his views of the urgency of inaugurating some system of home leave for thetroops in Italy, and I am persuaded that the fighting men, in particular, in that theatre,require some such fillip to their morale if they are to constitute a powerful instrument of offence ready to our hands, when the time comes for the final all-out onslaught on theGermans from the South.A scheme of home leave from overseas theatres has, therefore, been worked outin the War Office. Quite shortly, it is proposed that, with the increased frequency of convoy cycles from 37 to 20 days which, I understand, the Ministry of War transport would welcome and the Admiralty are prepared now to undertake, a commencementcan be made with monthly quotas from the several overseas theatres as follows,commencing with the convoy leaving India early in December:Italy/N. AfricaMiddle EastP.A.I.C.    ...East AfricaIndia/S.E.A.C.3,0001,200901001,500This will involve the absence of about 16,800 men from their operational theatres atany one time, and these men will not be replaced while they are away from theirtheatre. Their temporary absence from the theatre of war can be accepted, since their return after a few weeks can be counted upon: that is the real difference from postingto the home establishment when the man is lost to the fighting line unless he is replacedfrom home, and it is precisely such replacements that are not permitted in any con-siderable numbers by our present man-power. It is proposed that, within the abovequotas, the Theatre Commander should choose the men to be brought home on leave,the guiding principle being that this home leave is a reward for good and lengthyservice overseas, particularly in the lighting line. No individual soldier will get morethan one turn of home leave; there will be no minimum qualifying period of service,though the leave scheme is intended to benefit the man who has been away from homeover a long period. The entitlement of a soldier to posting to the home establishment atthe end of the overseas tour (the Python scheme), mentioned in the second paragraph
above, will not be affected by the leave plan, except that Commanders-in-Chief will naturally not send home men who would be repatriated under Python a short time after their return from home leave. The existing system of posting home on compassionate grounds will continue entirely separately.Although, from the operational standpoint, Theatre Commanders will probably beable to spare numbers of the kind I have mentioned above, without replacement, thiswill clearly only apply during the period of comparative quiet on the mediterranean and more distant fronts that we anticipate over the coming winter months. Again, itGerman resistance were to collapse and the Governments release plans had to be implemented, the demands upon shipping and the necessary re-sorting of Army personnel for the Far East war would, almost certainly, impose a discontinuance of the leavescheme within a short period of time. The scheme is also necessarily at the mercy of operational developments in any particular theatre of war, and the Theatre Commandermust have complete discretion to suspend its operation in his theatre for this reason.With the 20-day convoy cycle in operation, this plan should afford a clear four weeks at home to each soldier who comes on leave, exclusive of the time spent intravelling to and from the port in this country. It clearly involves a considerably longerabsence of the man from his unit, depending upon the particular overseas theatre fromwhich he comes.I am under no illusion as to the representations which will be made in the house and elsewhere that what the Army requires is a shortening of the overseas tour, in preference to a system of short leave at home such as I have outlined above. Further,such a scheme is almost bound, in practice, to give rise to inequalities in the way itworks between man and man, and I foresee complaints that the wife of a man withfour years&apos; overseas service does not get him home, while her neighbour, whose husbandhas only been abroad two years, has him at home for a month. But such inequalities inthe operation of the scheme are unavoidable. I am prepared to defend the plan on thegrounds, among others, that only the Theatre Commander can determine which menshall make up his monthly quota from the theatre, having regard to the guiding principleswe give him; and also that a short period of leave at home is the one way in which Ican., to some extent, alleviate the hardship imposed by the long separation of men fromtheir families by reason of overseas service.The fact is that there are still 40,000 men who have served more than four yearscontinuously overseas with the Army; the number with between three and four yearssuch service is 130,000, and this number increases as the war continues. To effect any appreciable reduction of these figures requires the despatch of replacements overseas toa number which is quite out of the question in the present man-power position of theArmy. If the men were available, I would gladly reduce the tour of overseas service.But, with the increasing stringency of our resources of man-power in this country, theWar Cabinet have been unable, in the successive reviews of man-power which have takenplace, to allocate to the Army the numbers which I have demanded. I fully recognizethe reasons for the shortfall in the allocations which the Cabinet has made to the Armyin the last two years, and I am grateful for the way the Minister of Labour and NationalSendee has honoured those allocations, both in the letter and in the spirit. But thepresent position is that the Army, unlike, for instance, the R.A.F., has no reserve offit young men at home who constitute potential reinforcements for overseas, and thereare such serious shortages on establishment numbers in Field Marshal Montgomery&apos;sand in General Alexanders armies, as well as in India and South-East Asia, that thereis no alternative to the &quot; cannibalization &quot; of further formations.In a few days&apos; time, I hope to put forward the Army request for man-power inconnection with the November review by the War Cabinet. The need for more men,it is already clear to me, will be urgent. If the war with Germany ends next spring,then the needs of the Army for the second stage of the war can no doubt be met fromthe training of the new intakes received in the coming months. But if the German warcontinues well into the summer, it may well prove that only by obtaining for the Armynow considerable numbers of partially-trained men could we ensure that the ranks ofthe fighting formations are then filled.I have referred to the general man-power position in the Armv because our shortageof men is the overriding reason why I can only propose a system&quot; of short leave for thetroops overseas, from which, in any case, only a comparatively small proportion will benefit, instead of that reduction in the overseas tour of the soldier which I recognise is really needed, and for which there is such a powerful demand. Meanwhile, I think theleave scheme I now propose will go some way to affording relief to men of long service overseas and to their families in this country, and I ask the War Cabinet to give it their approval. The Prime Minister, to whom I have referred the plan, has expressed hisendorsement of it, and would propose to announce it himself in the House, with some reference to its obvious drawbacks and limitations. I append to this Paper a briefoutline of a statement of the kind the Prime Minister may be willing to make.The War Office,14th November, 1944.P. J. G.
ANNEX.DRAFT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME minister on many occasions recently, and from all quarters of the House, there has been pressure to effect some reduction in the present period of overseas service in the Army. The Secretaryof State for War has explained the many difficulties of operations, of shipping and of man-power which stand in the way of reducing the overseas tour in the Army. I have myself also pointed out quite recently, in relation to this very question, the over-riding need for doing nothing which will weaken our effort in the fighting theatres at this climax of the war.The problem is an intractable one, but it has been approached from every angle andwith all sympathy for the men who have been separated from their families at home forall too long by the exigencies of the war. The limited reductions in the lengthof the overseas tour in the Army which restrictions of shipping and man-power admit haverecently been stated in the House by the Secretary of State for War [26th September].The same man-power difficulty does not arise where men leave the theatre of war for a relatively short period, and return to their units thereafter; and the recent general improvement in the shipping situation has enabled the period of absence from their unitsinvolved in sending men on leave to be reduced considerably. The War Office have,therefore, proposed to me that the system of repatriation of men with long continuous service overseas should be supplemented by a leave scheme for the benefit of those who, while not yetqualified for repatriation, have for a considerable length of time overseas borne the burdenof campaigns fought often in the most adverse climatic conditions. A plan has been worked out to afford a period of leave at home of about four weeks&apos; duration to a number of menwho have borne the main burden of battle in the fighting line, after considerable service overseas. Operational and shipping considerations necessarily restrict the benefits of thisscheme to a proportion only of those whom we should like to bring within its scope if these considerations permitted. A quota of men to come home under this scheme has been allotted to the Commanders-in-Chief in each of the following overseas theatres : Italy and north Africa, Middle East, Persia/Iraq, India/South East Asia and East Africa. within that quota Commanders-in-Chief will select the men to come home, I hope at intervals ofevery three weeks or so. This leave plan, as will be readily understood by the House, mustbe subject to operational needs in each theatre, and the Commander-in-Chief has completediscretion in suspending it on that account if the necessity arises. Again it will clearly needreview if hostilities with Germany should come to an end during its currency, when theclaims upon shipping and the man-power of the Government release plans would &apos; have priority.I should add that the existing arrangements for posting home of men on urgent com-passionate grounds will continue unaffected by this leave scheme, as will also the entitle-ment to repatriation of men who have served continuously overseas for those periods which my Right honble.. Friend indicated in this House on 26th September as his objective in thereduction of the overseas tour of service in the Army.I am well aware that the shortening of the overseas tour in the Army is far preferable to a system of short leave at home such as I have just indicated. I am also aware that theworking of this leave plan will inevitably&quot; give rise to some inequalities as between man andman. But I commend this plan to the House because I feel that the impossibility of achieving some general overall reduction in the Army overseas tour should not preclude all hope of seeing their families for those who cannot be posted home ; the Secretary of State forWar informs me that a scheme of even this limited scope will have a very beneficial effect upon the morale of the Army overseas, and his opinion is confirmed by the strongly expressedviews of the Commanders-in-Chief.I hope it may prove possible that a contingent of men from the Mediterranean theatremay benefit from this leave scheme in time to be with their families at the ChristmasFestival this year. From the more distant theatres men will arrive in this country onlyin the early weeks of the New Year. As regards the British Armies in North-West Europe,the problem is a different one. The men fighting there have not been engaged in thiscampaign for long, and it may be that within a reasonable time it will be possible to institute some system of short leave to the United Kingdom on the lines enjoyed by ourArmies in France and Belgium in the last war. But the practicability of any such plan mustturn on operational developments which we can none of us at the moment foresee.(b44/188)   no   11/44   W.O.P.   19912
