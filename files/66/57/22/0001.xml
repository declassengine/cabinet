THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY-S GOYE.RNM.ENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1944.SECRET. Copy No.   3gW.P. (44) 622.4ith November, 1944.WAR CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS SPAIN.Note by the Lord President of the Council and Deputy Prime Minister.I tihink that it is time for us to reconsider our attitude towards the present government in Spain. In the earlier stages of the war our strategic positionforced us to take a very careful line. In my view Lord Templewood, holding very weak hand, played his cards with great skill. As our arms becamesuccessful he was able to take a stronger line. With Italy as a co-belligerentand Germany driven out of France, Spain is isolated and is left as the onlyneutral exponent of Fascism.2. Lord Templewood has frequently pointed out in the strongest terms the incompetence, corruption and oppression of the Franco regime which the spaniards have now endured for so long. He has stated that the regime haslittle support outside the Falange and that only the absence of a generally accepted alternative keeps Franco in power. Franco owes his position to our enemies who used Spain as a practice ground for the frightfulness which theysubsequently inflicted on ourselves and our Allies. He continues to keep in prison many thousands of Spaniards and he executes a number of his prisonersevery month. There is not one of our Allies who would not wish to see thisregime destroyed and we are running into the danger of being considered to beFranco&apos;s sole external support.3. I am aware that it is unlikely at present that a democratic Governmentcould be established with general support owing to the deep divisions amongthe Spanish people. I do not think that in view of Spanish xenophobia thatit is possible to take overt action to change the situation, but short of this thereis much that can be done.4. We should aim at getting in Spain a Government which would be inclined to toleration and which would prepare the way for a developmenttowards a democracy.5. To this end we should stiffen our attitude towards the present regime and make it very clear that its disappearance would be welcome to the United nations and would bring definite advantages to the Spanish people. We should use what-,ever methods are available to assist in bringing about its downfall. We should,especially in the economic field, work with the United States and France to denyfacilities to the present regime.C. R. A.Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,A4h November, 1944.[28537]
