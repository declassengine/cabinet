MOSCOW CONFERENCE.Note by the Secretariat of tpie British Mission.THE Conference assembled on the 29th September, 1941. M. Molotovwelcomed the British and American Delegations, and Lord Beaverbrook andMr. Harriman replied. Thereafter the following tripartite committees were set up : (a) Military.(6) Air.(c) Naval.(d) Raw Materials.(e) Transportation.(/) Medical.2. The above Committees were in constant session throughout the next two days. Discussions were confined to an examination of the Russian requests andof the types of material which might be supplied. The Chairmen of the Delega-tions were kept informed of the progress of this work and held daily meetings with M. Stalin.3. As a result, an agreement was drafted by the Chairmen setting out theRussian requests on the one side and the extent to which they could be met fromBritish and American sources on the other. This agreement was approved by theBritish and American Delegates. It was accepted by M. Stalin and signed bythe three Chairmen of Delegations at 6 p.m. on 2nd October. A copy is attached(Enclosure I), together with reports by British Delegates on various aspects ofthe visit (Enclosures II, III., IV, V and VI).4. Meanwhile, a closing plenary conference had been held on 1st October.M. Molotov delivered a long speech, in which the main points were (a) the satis-faction of the Soviet Government at the speedy and outstanding success of theconference; (b) his conviction that the powerful front created would frustrateHitler&apos;s aim to destroy his adversaries one by one; and (c) his assurance of theindomitable will of the Soviet Union to continue the struggle until final victory.Mr. Harriman, in the course of his reply on behalf of the British and american Delegations, said that he had been authorised to express M. Stalin&apos;sthanks for the generous supplies; these would enable tie Soviet Union tostrengthen its defences and deliver vigorous attacks against the enemy.M. Molotov&apos;s speech and Mr. Harriman&apos;s reply had been agreed by all threeChairmen before the Conference.5. Lord Beaverbrook had many conversations with His Majesty&apos;s Ambas-ambassador. Sir Stafford Cripps agreed with the general procedure adopted at theConference, but suggested that supply decisions should be based on a full exchangeof information regarding the resources and strategic needs of the three countries and that the Russian Delegation should be pressed for such information. It wasdecided, however, that this information could be obtained, if at all, only after longarguments and delays, which might have prejudiced the success of the Conference.6. On the 2nd October discussions were held on the re-equipment of thePolish forces in Russia; a report on these discussions by Lord Beaverbrook andMr. Harriman is attached at Enclosure VII.*7. Throughout the Conference the Embassy and the Military Missionafforded every possible assistance.W. L. GORELL BARNESW. G. STIRLINGSecretaries.H.M.S. London,October 6, 1941.

Military Report.1. Military Committee. The discussions in the Military Committee took the form of a statement by the Russian Delegates of the character and extent oftheir immediate needs in army equipment, followed by detailed explanations bythe American and British Delegates of the types of equipment which might, ifthe Heads of their respective Delegations so decided, be made available to meetthose needs. All attempts to elicit information as to the basis on which Russianneeds had been estimated met with evasive replies; and it was clear from the outset that Colonel-General Yakovlev, and his colleagues, most of whom made no contribution to the proceedings, were under the strictest orders to divulge no information either of the war situation or even of the organization of the russian army.It is, however, noteworthy that Russian needs were practically confined towhat may be termed the &quot;new&quot; weapons of this war, i.e., tanks, A/T guns and A/Aartillery, and that they were not interested in our offer of substantial quantitiesof the most modern field artillery and machine guns. From this it is perhapspermissible to make two deductions. First, that the Russians have asked only for those supplies which they really need; and, secondly, that their production programmes have proved adequate to meet the pre-war conception of modernwar, but did not take into sufficient account the preponderating influence that wasto be exerted by the aeroplane and the tank.2. Strategical discussions. There were no discussions on military matters with the Russian General Staff.,, but the following points emerged during thevarious talks which Lord Beaverbrook. had with Stalin : The Germans have 320 Divisions, the Russians 280 Divisions.The Russian production of tanks is 1,400 per month.Before the invasion Russian tank production was 2,000 per month.The German infantry is weak compared to the Russian infantry. TheGerman infantry is strengthened by tanks. Without tanks they could make noheadway.Stalin says that tanks and airplanes decide war.3. In addition General Ismay had 10 minutes&apos; private talk with Stalin inthe course of the entertainment at the Kremlin. Stalin started the conversationwith the observation that England ought to have a large army. General Ismayexplained our man-power difficulties on the lines laid down in the Prime MinistersDirective. He was proceeding to enlarge on the shipping difficulties, when Stalininterjected that he quite understood why we could not at the moment establishia Western front. He then continued in the following sense: &quot; The whole situation in Europe has changed. Never again can England rely on her Navyalone. She must have conscription and a large army in time of peace. Therewill always be &apos; Petains&apos; in France and therefore no reliance can be placed inthe future on the French Army or people. Japan finds it possible to maintain a large army in addition to a large Navy. So why not England ? &quot; On this note the conversation ended.4. Military Mission and future co-operation with Russia. -If it is accepted that one of the principal tasks of a Military Mission is to obtain information asto the military situation of the Ally to whom it is accredited, General Macfarlaneand his colleagues are at present placed in an impossible position. The RussianGeneral Staff tell them precisely nothing. This may be accounted for partly bythe intense centralisation which obtains in Russia, and partly by the feeling of mutual distrust and dislike between the Russians and ourselves, which hasprevailed for over 20 years. But whatever the reason, anything in the nature of joint planning, whether in London or in Moscow, would in present circumstances be valueless. It is to be hoped that a new atmosphere and a new set of conditionswill be created by the punctual fulfilment of our promises of help.H. L. ISMAY.H.M.S. London,October6, 1941.
Note by the Parliamentary Under-Secertary of State for Air.1. At the request of Lord Beaverbrook, Head of the British Mission, i submit a Note on the general disposition of the Russians to the Mission, and inparticular on the- aircraft position.2. In every direction it was made clear to us that Russia welcomed theMission and wished for a result of substantial aid. Yet the Mission had to workagainst a political background of 20 years&apos; varying relationships with GreatBritain. In spite of the call for help the wall of secrecy against the foreignercould only be breached here and there.Every source of information leads us to the belief that Russia is fighting forher life and knows it. Those on top may have a selfish motive, for defeat wouldcrush them and the regime; those below fight patriotically for Russia, their land.3. Reception from time of arrival to departure was open-handed, if not open-hearted. Particularly so at Archangel, where Admiral Delinen, aged 39,with 15 years&apos; service, is in charge of Russian Naval forces and of the Port ofArchangel. Our naval authorities pay tribute to his administration of the Port,which he declares he will keep open through the winter, and for the handling of his ships. His destroyers are reported as being good vessels, well disciplined,even though there is a political commissar on each craft holding the same rankas the Captain, with large but not executive powers. Russian submarines are well reported on.The Admiral&apos;s reaction to the arrival of the Mission was positive, not onlyin lavish entertainment, but in genuine declarations of determination and co-operation. The arrival and work of the R.A.F. Hurricane Wing had inspiredhim to tributes of admiration.4. The flight from Archangel to Moscow and the return from Moscow to archangel gave a view of Russian air communications. These combine use of modern aircraft with flying practice of 20 years ago. The aircraft are Russian-built D.C.3&apos;s, well maintained but haphazardly loaded. The handling is first class and the bold piloting technique compares to a Cossack riding his horse.The usual flight height is brushing the tree-tops. This for two reasons : firstly,bad communication with gun defence posts, so that Russian aircraft are told to fly at a standard height otherwise they will be shot at, and, secondly, becausethroughout Russia there are no modern radio aids or meteorological informationsuch as we consider essential for safe operation of high-speed aircraft. If theRussian pilots once lost sight of the ground they would have no means of knowingcloud ceiling or of blind approach for descent.Unpunctuality characterises their flight plans, as it seems to, other arrange-ments. A scheduled start at 9 a.m. means a lucky 9.20 or more probably 10 o&apos;clock.Yet fighter escorts were prompt and well co-ordinated. Again, the puzzle of individual mechanical efficiency combined with collective inefficiency.5. In Moscow relationship with Russian leaders was friendly. Those of long service in Russia reported that Russia always excels in &quot; Doing the strangerwell &quot; by lavish food and drink. On the other hand, such a function as Stalhisdinner at the Kremlin with his personal unbending was almost unprecedentedand an advance on any relationship established during recent years.6. Mission work in Moscow was made both easier and harder by theirsystem of extreme Government centralisation of administration. Easier, because we knew that finally everything had to go to one of three or four Head men andthat Lord Beaverbrook had direct relationship with the leading two. Harder,because, with senior executives so shorn of power, discussion was stilted and decision beyond the limits of the mandate given to Delegates was impossible without reference back.7. The air position is typical of our other relationships with the Russianauthorities except those of the Navy, which are on a closer basis. Air Vice-Marshal Collier has good personal relations with certain Russian air officers.On the other hand, in spite of his long service in Moscow, he does not even know
where the administrative headquarters of the Air Division of the army is located.All requests and communications have to take place through the Foreign LiaisonDepartment. No air officer dare make a concession or give a decision without previous sanction from one of the political Heads, who, of course, know nothing of the essential technical aspects of exchanges between two air authorities.8. The Russian pilots are reported individually to be competent and brave.Their methods of conducting air warfare are unknown, as the Air Vice-Marshaland his staff have never been allowed near the Front.9. The Russians claim to have some system similar to R.D.F., but wouldgive no particulars. From what Stalin told Lord Beaverbrook, and from other sources, it is probably on the principle of a series of wireless certains at intervalsup to two or three hundred miles from Moscow which will give information as towhen aircraft pass ovehead, but do not, like R.D.F., keep track of them, their numbers or their height.10. The Russians would not, during the work of the Air Sub-Committee or at other times, give information as to their first-line strength. They stated thatthe German Air Force on their Front is one and a half times as strong as they.11. The Russians have shown remarkable aptitude in learning to erectTomahawks and Hurricanes.12. The Russians will give no information as to the availability of aero-dromes. On the other hand, we know that in an incredibly short time they builta fighter aerodrome near Archangel with cleverly constructed wooden runwaysof great length. Quick effective technical improvisation is a developedcharacteristic.13. The Russians can build first-class aircraft and engines (refer to laterparagraphs on visits to factories). We need have no anxiety as to their ability to erect, fly and maintain our types of aircraft, provided that we give them a fairchance by adequate supplies of equipment, spares, ammunition, &amp;c. We shouldnot be tempted to say, &apos;&apos; Are we quite sure that the Russians can use our equip-ment 1 &apos;&apos; but rather &apos;&apos; Are we giving the Russians every facility which willenable them, with their peculiar efficiency in some directions and limitations in others, to get the best out of what we are sending ? &apos;&apos;Both air forces are fighting in wild country. Tracked aerodromes, meteoro-logical data, radio aids, maintenance equipment&apos; and facilities will all be in short supply. We are accustomed to fighting our Metropolitan Air Force withthese aids and facilities, as indeed are the Germans in the Low Countries andFrance. How far the lack of those civilised air aids to which we are accus-accustomed will act as limiting the Russian air effort, or how far it will be to their advantage, through an acclimatised force fighting one accustomed to luxury aids,is problematical. It may well be that the Russians will get the best of thisquestion.14. Russian types in production are known to us. Their experimental typesunder development are not. The best fighter is the M.I.G.3. They have a close-support aircraft known as the &quot; Storm Attack &quot; type, which has been flown by our test pilot, Squadron Leader Slee, who reports its characteristics are: heavyarmourplating all round and good field of view. This aircraft carries the Rocketbomb. Stalin particularly mentioned this type to Lord Beaverbrook as being-something the Russians are proud of. Using their Air Force as they do insupport of the army rather than as an independent weapon, this type may be ofgreat value.15. The Commissar for the Aircraft Industry told me that Russia is developing a four-engined bomber at two factories.  We do not know any details.16. The Air Sub-Committee established most friendly relations with theRussian members led by Commissar Shakhyrin, a rising young man of theAdministration. He is efficient in his job and prompt to &quot;decide, but alwayssubject to strict limitations imposed from above as to what he could agree to orgive in information. I hope he may be invited to pay a visit to England, when we could show him selected factories.   I am sure such a visit would bear fruit.The official agreement for the provision of 400 aircraft monthly, being100 light and medium bombers and 100 fighters from the United States and
200 fighters a month from Britain for nine months from the 1st October to the30th June, has already been reported. It can be regarded as highly satisfactoryfrom the British point of view as, at first, the Russian demand was for 300bombers and 100 fighters monthly. This measure of help ensures Russian good-will and effort in the air : it preserves our heavy bomber position : it gives Russiano heavy bombers from the United States, thereby increasing our prospects of a bigger allotment: it preserves our Kittyhawk position in the Middle East.18. We must endeavour to meet Russian particular needs, within the limits of our commitments, so far as we are able and without a disposition to questionevery Russian basis of demand. For instance, Russia wants some cannon-gunfighters, feeling, as Stalin told Lord Beaverbrook, that the machine gun,particularly the -303, is obsolete. Though we oan try to correct this wrongimpression, such efforts are useless, and we should therefore give some cannon-gunfighters. Russia asks for ammunition on the basis of 20 complete refills perfighter. According to our standards, based on estimated sorties and expenditureof ammunition, this is over provisioning. Nevertheless, discussion with theRussians shows that they are flogging their aircraft and pilots and they reallydo seem to need some such amount. Therefore, if within our resources, let usgive it. They ask that maintenance equipment and spares should be on a generousscale. We should not provision on the scale we do to provide for a Unit overseas,but rather should meet Russian demands to the maximum extent within our power.We do not know as well as the Russians what the Russians need for Russia.19. Commissar Shakhyrin gave the present Russian production figure as40 fighters, 20 bombers, 10 attack aircraft daily. This was given only afterauthority from above. His figures are the same as Stalin gave Lord Beaverbrook.The Commissar said to Air Vice-Marshal Collier privately : &quot; We do not oftengive figures in Russia, but when we do they are true ones.&quot; From two factoriesvisited and other sources I believe the figures to be true. They may conflict with air Ministry estimates, but in the past the Air Ministry has under-estimatedRussian resources as indeed has Hitler.We gave no figures of British production.Commissar Shakhyrin maintains that, even if Leningrad falls and theGerman armies advance eastwards, Russian production will rise steadily as new factories come into play and other factories, moved East of the Volga, re-commenceoperations.   New types will be put into service.20. We were allowed to visit No. 1 Aircraft Factory-reported by theGermans to have been bombed and destroyed. It is 10 minutes from the centre of Moscow, on the edge of the Central Airport. It concentrates on production ofthe M.I.G. 3, a low-wing, single-seater fighter of comparable performance to theSpitfire, but of inferior armament. We have all particulars of the M.I.G. 3 whichhas been flown by our own test pilot, who generally thinks well of it. Thepresent armament consists of two - 5 machine guns, but with a larger ammunitionsupply than we give our guns. The exact ammunition quantity was not revealed.The fighter has a wooden rear fuselage, metal front fuselage and centre section,with single-spar wooden wings. The Russians admit this wing construction tobe heavier than metal, but saving in metal raw material. The factory is very-great according to our standards, but floor space, labour force and output numberswere not revealed. The factory works in three shifts. Though the buildings arenot modern, machinery and machine tools of Russian, German and Americanmake are absolutely up to date. We saw aircraft on the production line in all stages. We saw all processes of manufacture their forging and heat treatmentequipment and technique drew particular praise from the U.S. engineer officer in the party. I saw about 100 aircraft in the final assembly shop. We did not see the numbers awaiting air test in the flight sheds. I guess that in a singleshift there are between 6-8,000 employees. From a general survey of the factoryI estimate the daily output to average not less than 10 and not more than14 M.I.G. 3 fighters. ^There were no air raid shelters to be seen nor were there any blast walls toprevent bomb explosion effects.The operatives looked young and intent on their work; 30 per cent, arewomen.The Director of the factory assured us that there were at least two morefactories in other parts of Russia producing the M.I.G. 3.
21. We visited an engine factory half an hour&apos;s run from the aircraftPlant, passing through Moscow with its wide, modern streets, decaying houses,drably dressed people with little gaiety in their faces, but all of them reasonably well clothed and the children particularly so. It is worth while to mention thatthe only time we saw Muscovites show any signs of gaiety was their reaction to the Ballet.The engine factory makes the A.M. 35 type motor, fitted to the M.I.G. 3 andto other Russian aircraft. It is a 12 cylinder &apos; V &apos; type, outwardly like theMerlin. The Plant is extremely well laid out and, like the airframe factory, full of the most modern equipment and machine tools. The shop managers wereimpressive in their power of command and obvious efficiency. The engine givessome 1,200 H.P., but is capable of development to higher rating. I understandthis is in hand. Floor space, number of operatives or output were not revealed.The Works are on a two-shift basis and I should estimate that between three and four thousand operatives are employed on each shift. We saw finished engines and, based on what we had seen throughout the process, I estimate that this factoryturns out not less than six and not more than nine hundred engines a month.There were no air raid shelters and no blast walls.The Director stated there are two other factories producing the A.M. 35.22. There remains the Rocket Bomb. Probably the weapon which wouldbe of most value to us if General Mason Macfarlane&apos;s and Air Vice-MarshalCollier&apos;s views are right. They feel that this weapon may be one which canchange the character of air support warfare and be a powerful weapon for air-craft against shipping and tanks. Air Vice-Marshal Collier has seen it throwa rocket bomb between two and three kilometres. The Russians claim it willthrow one four to five. The &quot;storm attack aircraft&quot; can carry four rocketbombs under each wing on the eight ordinary bomb rack rails. It is reportedto be simple to manufacture, in operation, and accurate in aim. Air Vice-MarshalCollier has already sent a description and sketch to the Air Ministry and I under-stand this has gone to the M.A.P. The U.P. weapon should not be thought to relieve us of the need of getting this rocket bomb. Lord Beaverbrook has pressedMolotov, who has promised to represent the matter to Stalin. I hope we shallintensify effort to get this, our one main air request, from the Russians.23. Air Raid bomb effects on Moscow were practically invisible. I was told that within a few hundred yards of the American Embassy bombs had fallen,one in an underground shelter and another on a factory, both causing heavy casualties. Air raid damage is quickly screened off or repaired, whilst casulties are never published. The Moscow air barrage is intense. Stalin told LordBeaverbrook that there are 800 guns over 20 mms. defending Moscow. Thereis an inner and an outer ring. There is almost certainly no S.L.C. or G.L., butan elaborate sound locating system. I stood on our Embassy roof during theonly night when the barrage functioned, and I have the impression that everygun opens up, blazing away even though having little chance of hitting theenemy, but certainly with a severe moral effect.24. Finally, if our aid to.Russia is to be swift and effective, regular aircommunication is essential. The Air Ministry has rejected the Northern routeon account of the hazards, weather conditions, enemy interference and lack of proper radio and meteorological aids. The project signalled to Air Vice-MarshalCollier while the Mission was in Moscow is for two B. 24&apos;s to operate direct fromthe United Kingdom to Cairo, and thence by Lockheed Lodestar to Baghdad,Mosul and to some aerodrome round Baku. From here a regular Russian shuttleservice would run to Moscow. We shall, however, endeavour to establish our right to run our own aircraft right through to Moscow, for we do not wish to be entirely dependent on Russia. We must be willing to give Russia reciprocalrights, possibly to Cairo. I recommend that we should push on with the estaklishment of this line at the earliest possible moment.I understand that the U.S. authorities are considering running a fort-nightly non-stop B. 24 service from the Middle East direct to Moscow. when our line and the U.S.A. one are established, air communication should be reasonably adequate as regards frequency and carrying capacity.H. EE. B.H.M.S. London,October 6, 1941.
ENCLOSURE IV.Transportation Committee.Note by Sir Archibald Roivlands.I. THE principal Soviet Delegate, who was elected Chairman of the Sub-Committee, was M. Krutikov, the Vice-Commissar for Transportation. He is aclour, shaggy, taciturn but pleasant man, of medium build and of about 40. Hewas clearly master of his job, but equally clearly resolved, at any rate at the outset, to preserve a masterly silence about its details. As the discussions pro-ceeded, however, he became more communicative, but throughout evaded questions to which the American and British delegates would have liked replies in order to test the information given by the Soviet Delegation as to the adequacy of theirfacilities for the receipt at and onward despatch from Russian ports of goods which we are being asked to send to Russia.2. In the result the information given below as to these facilities rests forthe most part on the bare assurances of the Soviet Delegation, and in some instances at least represents, in our view, an over-optimistic picture of thefacilities which exist or can be made available in the near future. For example,the proposals put to us by the Russians involve the onward despatch by rail fromArchangel of an average throughout the year of some 9,000 tons a day. Judgedby the handling of the September convoy, there are serious doubts whether the train-loading facilities at the port are capable of dealing with anything like9,000 tons a day. It is fair to say, however, that the Soviet Delegation told us that they are improving and extending the sidings at Archangel, and the russians are masters at improvisation.3. Requests for shipping.-The most important point which emerged at theSub-Committee was the statement that the Soviet Government required an averageimport of 500,000 tons a month. Towards this they said they would provide90,000 tons a month, plus three tankers, one of which is undergoing repair, with atotal capacity of 27,000 tons. Based on an average turn-round of three months from and to American and British ports an import programme of 500,000 tons amonth represents an allocation of some million and a half tons of shipping. Whilethe general agreement with the Soviet Government provides that the UnitedStates and ourselves will &quot; give aid to the transportation of and help with the delivery of supplies &apos;&apos; it avoids a guarantee that all the shipping required can bemade available. It is important to note that three-fifths of the imports askedfor represent food-stuffs which the Russians will be buying in the open market in north America and the Dutch East Indies.4. Ports of Entry into Russia. The more important points relating to the ports of entry into Russia are as follows : (a) Archangel. It is clear that the Russians pin their main hopes to archangel. They state that the port can handle an average of270,000 tons a month (but see paragraph 2 above for the american and British view) : that it is ice free until the middle of December :and that it can be kept open by ice breakers throughout the winter.Only three, and at times not more than one to two, ships can, however,be passed through the ice-free channel at a time, and ships in convoyawaiting ice-breaker assistance would have to wait at an ice-free port(Yakunga, half-way between Murmansk and the entrance to theWhite Sea, was suggested). Ships for Archangel would require specialstrengthening during the ice period.(b) Murmansk. In spite of its natural facilities, it is clear that the Russiansplace little reliance on Murmansk in present conditions. Their doubtsappear to rest on their inability, owing to enemy action, to use the murmansk-Leningrad railway and on the complete inadequacy of thealternative route Murmansk-Archangel.
(c) Vladivostok. The Russians only want to use Vladivostok for supplies required to maintain their Far Eastern Provinces, the principalcommodity required being food-stuffs. They claim that Vladivostokcan handle up to 220,000 tons a month, but in our view there is some doubt about this.(d) Iranian and Caspian Routes. The Russians express confidence in their ability to deal across the Caspian with any traffic likely to be madeavailable by the Trans-Iranian routes or via Baluchistan orAfghanistan. They stated that they had already started improving the port facilities at Bandar Caspian. They also claimed that, ifRostov were to fall, Astrakhan and Guriev would be adequate to dealwith the Trans-Caspian traffic.An interesting point which emerged was that the Russians appeared to belsurprised and even startled by the scope of our plans for increasing the capacity!of the Trans-Iranian routes. We had the definite impression that they were \keen on keeping us away as far as possible from the Caspian ports. They insisted, jfor example, that they must be responsible for the road traffic from Kasvin toPahlevi, even of traffic which arrived by road at Kasvin (which is also the railwayterminal for Pahlevi traffic) even though this procedure is obviously uneconomicalin time and transport. On the other hand, they asked that the traffic along theroad which separates the rail-head at Zenjan from the railway at Tabriz shouldbe carried in Anglo-American lorries.5.   Summarised, the views of the British and American delegates are :  (a) Even if the shipping for the import of 500.000 tons of goods a monthcan be made available, there is considerable doubt whether the port and railway facilities in Russia can handle so much traffic.(b) The maintenance of a considerable flow of traffic through Archangel inthe winter will impose a great strain on the Navy and on the Ministryof War Transport.(c) The position as regards both (a) and (b) would be improved if the threat of enemy interference with the railway Southwards from Murmanskwere removed and if full use could be made of that port.(d) The Trans-Iranian routes should be developed to the maximum extent and with the greatest possible speed.6. A detailed report has been prepared for the use of the Ministry of war transport and the Admiralty.A. ROWLANDS.H.M.S. London,October 6th, 1941.[23004]
October 7, 1941.Raw Materials and Equipment.Note by Sir Archibald Rowlands.1. The two visiting delegations recommended the immediate acceptance of17 Soviet demands, 11 by the United Kingdom covering tin, lead, cobalt,electrolytic copper, electrolytic zinc, rubber, jute, shellac, wool, cocoa beans andindustrial diamonds, 6 by the U.S.A. covering molybdenum, petroleum products,phosphorus, graphitised electrodes, T.N.T. and barbed wire. A demand fortank armour is to be satisfied in part by the U.S.A. 12 demands includingtoluene, rolled brass, nickel, leather, cloth, boots, lorries and an increased demandfor aluminium were referred back for favourable consideration. 28 demands which include machine tools, cutting tools, factory equipment and variousgrades of steel are referred back for consideration in London and Washingtonas the necessity of detailed specification made any expression of opinion imprac-,ticable. Only one demand, viz., magnesium, was rejected outright, but we haveagreed to return to the Soviet Union magnesium obtained from raw materialsthey supply to us.2. Of United Kingdom requirements, 18 items, including Archangel pitch,chrome ore, horsehair, magnesite, muriate of potash, pine tar, canned salmon and timber, were agreed to by the Russians. Platinum requirements and bristlesare likely acceptances. The Soviet Union cannot provide aniline, dimethylaniline,or silk.3. The talks with the Russians were businesslike and direct. The Commissaifor Foreign Trade, M. Mikoyan, is terse in speech and forbidding in attitude.But he has a sense of humour and could be made to laugh. The atmosphere wasnot exactly cordial but was certainly not unfriendly. His colleagues were allvery young and capable, and given the opportunity, would have been veryforthcoming.4. Some information was given, e.g., about aluminium, but not much. TheRussians have not yet reached the stage where they would engage in frankdiscussions in order to settle a reasoned distribution of available resources, thoughthat problem will arise in the near future as regards machine tools. what. Mikoyan endeavoured to establish was the claim to fixed minimum quotas in tonnage or value within which their requirements would be met without questionregardless of priorities in the United Kingdom and U.S.A. We did not provoke a general discussion on that attitude, but were studious to emphasise theimportance of planning and priorities for machine tools.5. Nevertheless, certain definite impressions were conveyed to the visitors.On the whole the Soviets&apos; demands for raw materials were felt to be reasonable in scale, and we were not much embarrassed by the absence of information. Theyare moving their aluminium Plants to the Ural region, and we formed theimpression that they are determined to see this dispersal completed. The require-ments of machinery and factory equipment suggest the large-scale planning ofnew construction to be pressed forward during the next year or eighteen months.A. ROWLANDS.
L*8Medical Supplies.Note by Sir Charles Wilson.A list of drugs, surgical instruments, laboratory and Hospital supplies, withthe amounts needed, was submitted in writing (in English and Russian) byDr Kolesnikov, the chairman of the Russian Medical Delegation and Vice-Commissar for Public Health. There are 83 items. A list of this kind was needed because in such lists as were available in London before the departure of the Mission many of the surgical instruments asked for could not be identified.For example, in the list given to the Mineworkers&apos; Federation of Great Britainthrough M. Maisky, I find six items in succession marked &quot; Insufficient informa-tion. No action taken.&quot; The list of surgical instruments has therefore been checked by the actual instrument and the reference in three standard cataloguesis given.The amounts required in this list have no relation to the amounts specifiedin former lists, e.g., 30,000 surgical gloves has now become 500,000 surgical gloves.This list was submitted to all the relevant authorities and represents the con-sidered official demands.It is not possible to check the amounts. The figures appear formidable, e.g.,850,000 pairs of forceps, 500,000 record syringes, 10,000,000 record needles,225,000 scissors, 250,000 rubber hot-water bottles, but the army supplied is verylarge.   The full list will be sent to the Ministry of Supply.Pooling of Medical Knotvledge.The Medical Research Council, working under the Privy Council, printsan abstract of important contributions to the medical literature of many countries.This abstract used to be sent to Moscow, and was much appreciated; during 1941its delivery has been very irregular. I was pressed to arrange for the regulardelivery of the Abstract and of other medical literature.   -I was also asked by many scientists if an exchange of four Russian for fourEnglish scientists could be arranged. A visit of this kind would probablycontribute to a better understanding between the two countries.Discussions.We met and discussed with the leading authority (chosen by Dr. Kolesnikov)the following subjects : Nature and treatment of shock : Professor Levitt.Blood transfusion : Professor Bagdasoroff.Burns : Professor Vishnevskey.Wounds and injuries : Professor Rufanoff.Anaesthesia : Professor Levitt.Development of Neuro-surgery in the Soviet Union : Professor Propper-Graschenkov.Infectious diseases. Prevalence and availability of specific drugs or sera :Professor Yankelevitch.We obtained an outline of the field Medical Organisation of an infantry division and of an armoured division of the Russian Army.We were unable to obtain any information about the medical problemspeculiar to an air force nor about certain physiological problems connected withthe use of tanks. The authorities appeared reluctant to furnish this information.The purpose of these discussions was to find out whether, on the one hand, theRussians were familiar with the work that has been done on these subjects inEngland and America, and, on the other hand, whether they had made contri-butions to knowledge of which we were ignorant. The result of our enquiries canbe summarised by saying that while the Russians do not appear to have made any important contributions to our knowledge of these subjects with which weare not already familiar, their knowledge is up to date and their practice inaccordance with that of the most modern institutions in England and America.An Abstract of these discussions will be submitted to the Ministry of Health.[23004] E
Central Institute for Blood Transfusion.We visited this Institute because the organisation for providing blood foran army is a useful test case of medical arrangements in general. The scale onwhich transfusion is carried out may be appreciated from the fact that in moscow alone, from 800-1,200 donors attended daily to give their blood. Thereare 25 centres in Moscow where the donors are physically examined and4 collecting centres where the donors are X&amp;typed and bled. The blood is taken inrefrigerating boxes in aeroplanes to the Field hospitals and delivered to theRegimental aid posts, from one to two miles behind the Front. There are similarInstitutes in ten cities in Russia.The Institute of Epidemiology was visited to find out if epidemic disease(e.g., dysentery, typhoid, malaria, typhus, cerebro-spinal-spinal-meningitis) is rife inRussia, and if it is, or if it should become so, whether the specific drugs andsera for combating such epidemics are available, and what prophylactic measures have been taken.There has been a considerable amount of dysentery of a mild variety. Therehave been several epidemics of typhus in Bessarabia, the Western Ukraine andthe West part of White Russia, but these regions have been breeding grounds of this disease for centuries. The prevalence of typhus has not apparently been greatly increased by the war, though, there is, of course, a risk that refugees fromthese parts may spread typhus to the rest of Russia where, at present, there areonly sporadic cases. In short, apart from the prevalence of dysentery,&apos; the incidence of infectious diseases is not a serious military problem at the presenttime.The scale on which the Institute works may be gauged by the fact that anti-tetanic inoculations are prepared for 2 million soldiers every month. Thereare 36 smaller but similar Institutes in Russia for the production of vaccinesand sera. It is quite unnecessary, we were told, to send sera and vaccines toRussia if we can furnish them with raw materials for their laboratory work.The scientific workers of the Institute spend half of the year in the Fieldin mobile laboratories, &amp;c, so that one had the opportunity of talking to thosewho knew the conditions in the Field.The Gorky Institute of Experimental Medicine had a staff of 600 scientificworkers before the war, now reduced to half that number by the exigencies ofwar. The annual budget is 25 million roubles. It is entirely devoted to research.We were impressed alike by the magnitude of the conception of the Institute andby the quality of the work done. There is nothing comparable to it in othercountries with which we are acquainted. From our visits to the Institutes wewere satisfied (1) That they were organised on a scale commensurate with the size of thecountry a scale unknown outside Russia,(2) That the organisation was first class and the quality of the work first rate.(3) That detailed investigation of such Institutes, department by department,made as we made it, goes a long way to get at the truth : that thattruth, as far as it goes, is reassuring.It would appear that the Russians are in the van of one great branch of human activity, namely, Medical Research- a fact not without some bearing onthe larger issue of how far Russia is prepared for modern war.CHARLES WILSON.October 7, 1941.
Re-equipment-of Polish Forces in the U.S.S.R.Joint Report by Mr. Harriman and Lord Beaverbrook to thePresident and the Prime Minister.ON Thursday, the 2nd October, we had a meeting with the PolishAmbassador, General Anders and General Bofors at the American Embassy in moscow. We were accompanied by the British and U.S. Ambassadors in moscow, Lieutenant-General Ismay, Lieutenant-General Mason Macfarlane,General Burns and Major-General Macready.The Polish representatives stated that they had enough men for 4 Divisions,i.e., about 44,000, at once, and that they would eventually have 100,000. TheRussians had only armed 1 Division, and had said that they could do no more.M. Molotov had advised General Anders to try to obtain arms on his own account.The Polish representatives added that they were also in need of clothing,both for troops and civilian internees.LORD BEAVERBROOK said that he could not commit his Government,particularly in view of their obligations to the Russians and the limitations oftransport. Mr. Harriman and he would endeavour to persuade the Russians to equip the Poles. If necessary, the United States and Great Britain would try to help the Russians to do this, though it was difficult to see how any further assistance could be given at the present time. Considerations of transportationwould not permit.GENERAL MACREADY said that the War Office would prepare ascheme for supplying a small proportion of the arms required, excluding tanks and aeroplanes.   But transportation would be the deciding factor.Mr. HARRIMAN expressed agreement with Lord Beaverbrook&apos;s statement.He promised to examine the position and to inform the President of the UnitedStates of the Polish representations.Mr. HARRIMAN expressed the view that the Russians should arm the Polesand undertook to discuss the project with the Russian Government.Later, Mr. HARRIMAN, accompanied by LORD BEAVERBROOK,presented the Polish case to M. Molotov.Mr. HARRIMAN said that the equipment of the Poles would have a beneficial political effect in the United States.   He declared that the Roman,Catholics in the United States required encouragement and that Polish influence in that direction would be important.M. MOLOTOV replied that the Russians could not do anything beyond the equipment of the single Division. The Russian Government would not, however,object to the United States and Great Britain taking decisions in the directionof arming the Poles.BEAVERBROOK.W. A. HARRIMAN.H.M.S. London, October 8, 1941.
