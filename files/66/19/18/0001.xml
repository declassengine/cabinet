THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.109SECRET.W.P. (41) 245.October 23, 1941.MTO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR GABINET.DECLARATION OF WAR ON FINLAND, hungary and ROUMANIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I SUBMIT to my colleagues the results of my examination of the questionwhether we should accede to the request of M. Molotov that we should nowdeclare war on Finland, Hungary and Roumania, as a gesture of solidarity withthe Soviet Union.2. Although we should naturally wish to meet the Soviet Government&apos;request, there are arguments of a practical nature against declaring war in thecase of each of the three countries. These were stated in detail in W.P. (41) 219 :they are summarised in paragraphs 5-10 of this paper.3. As regards all three countries, there is also the consideration that aBritish declaration of war would make it easier for Germany, if she so desiresat a later stage of the war, to force these countries to allow their troops to beused in operations against British forces, e.g., in the Near East or eventually in scandinavia.4. In any case, we should certainly consult the United States government before taking a decision.5. A declaration of war can have no practical effect; on the other hand,the Finns do not want an open conflict with us, and a considerable body of themincreasingly dislike the Germans and are reluctant to continue active operations.The threat conveyed in our recent message through the Norwegian Governmentto &quot; treat Finland as an open enemy, not only while the war lasts, but also whenpeace comes to be made,&quot; is only effective as a deterrent while it remains a threat.6. The shipping difficulties involved in a declaration of war, referred to inparagraph 5 of W.P. (41) 219, still remain.7. A declaration of war on Finland would be likely to be distasteful to alarge body of American public opinion, which still thinks of the Finns as agallant little people, who alone paid their debts to the United States; and itwould involve a divergence from the United States Government, who are nowincreasingly following mutatis mutandis the same policy as ourselves towardsFinland.Finland.[23041]
Hungary.8. * A declaration of war could have no practical effect, and would have an unfortunate effect upon the great majority of Hungarians, whose sympathiesare by no means pro-German and anti-British. It would also have an unfortunate effect upon our Polish Allies, who attribute considerable importance to the irrelations with Hungary after the war.Roumanta..9. So long as we do not declare war on Roumania we shall be free to adopt towards her whatever policy appears best when peace comes to be made. It maybe in our interests to build her up again. The Yugoslavs attach importance to there constitution of a strong Roumania and would therefore probably prefer us notto go to war with her.The case of Bulgaria.10. If war is declared on Roumania and Hungary, we shall be pressed bythe Greek and Yugoslav Governments to declare war on Bulgaria in view of the seizure by Bulgaria of portions of Greek and Yugoslav territory. In fact, theGreek Prime Minister has just urged His Majesty&apos;s Government to adopt a stronger line in regard to Bulgaria in view of the recent Bulgarian massacresof Greeks. Among the arguments against declaring war on Bulgaria, theprincipal is that the Turkish Government would view this measure with dis-pleasure. I would not therefore recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould agree to declare war on Bulgaria Oven if requested to do so by the greek and Yugoslav Governments. Nor do I consider that the Bulgarian argumentneed influence His Majesty&apos;s Government in making their decision as to whetheror not to declare war on Roumania and Hungary.11. If the decision is taken to declare war on Roumania and Hungary, Iwould explain to the Greek and Yugoslav Governments that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were doing so at the direct request of the Soviet Government, whohad not, however, included Bulgaria, in their request. If pressed further by theGreek Government in connexion with Bulgarian massacres of Greeks, I would try to satisfy them by proposing that they should address to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment a communication protesting in the name of humanity against theseatrocities, which His Majesty&apos;s Government would acknowledge in suitable terms,and that this correspondence should be then published.- Conclusions.1. The importance at this juncture of not rebuffing or discouraging ourRussian Allies outweighs the above arguments and I am in favour of declaring war on all three countries.2.   We should, however, first consult the United States Government.3. If they concur, I would first inform the Yugoslav and Greek Governmentsof our decision, as proposed above. I would also inform the Polish Government,in view of their special interest in relations with Hungary (see paragraph 8 above).Foreign Office, October 23, 1941.A. E.
