THE broad facts of the man-power position are shown statistically inthe Appendix to this memorandum.2. To meet the demands of the Services, the numbers of men and womenrequired during the 12 months ending June 1942 are as follows : Men. Women.Navy         ............      110,000 11,000Army         .........      ...      405,000* 205,000Air Force............      247,000 .    140,000Civil Defence       .........        67,000 106,000t829,000 462,0003. Under existing arrangements the available supply of men (including thefirst half of the 1923 class) is 468,000. If the requirements are to be met in full,a further 361,000 men will have to be found from among the 3,500,000 fit men aged18-40 still in civil life.4. The Ministry of Labour therefore propose to abandon the system of blockreservation by occupation in favour of a system of individual deferment.The age of reservation for all occupations will be raised by one year at a time at monthly intervals, individual deferment being granted only to men engaged on work of vital national importance.By this means, and by a drastic review of all existing deferments, theMinistry of Labour expect to find the balance of 361,000 men needed for theForces.The system of block reservation has served its purpose, and, now that theshortage of man-power has become acute, it is clearly necessary to use the finerand more flexible instrument of individual deferment. This change will,however, throw a heavy additional burden on the administrative machine of theMinistry of Labour, and a large measure of decentralisation will be necessary.My proposals assume that it will be possible to devise effective machinery forcombing out from the reserved occupations the large numbers who are notindividually indispensable to industry, and that the Ministry of Labour will have full and continuing support from the Supply Ministries and other interested* Excluding Army tradesmen.f Including Women&apos;s Land Army and certain other Services.[23057] b
Departments in their efforts to withdraw these men into the Forces. The Ministerof Labour is circulating a separate paper describing the nature of the machinery&apos;&apos;which he proposes to establish for this purpose.5. Under the original proposals of the Ministry of Labour these 361,000men were to be withdrawn from industry, by individual selection, in the followingproportions : From the 1,170,000 fit men of military age in the munitions industries      ...      ...       ...       ...      69,000From the 1,430,000 fit men of military age in other essential industries and services (e.g., agricul-ture, transport, &amp;c.)      ...       ...       ...       ...      87,000From the 900,000 fit men of military age in the less essential industries and services        ...       ...     205,0006. The 69,000 men to be withdrawn from the munitions industries are inaddition to 130,000 due to be withdrawn from those industries under existing arrangements.Moreover, the munitions industries will themselves require an additional315,000 men in the year ending June 1942.Large numbers of women are also needed For the Services (including Civil Defence) ... 462,000For the munitions industries   ...       ...       ...     460,000Total      ...............     922,000Further, the industrial requirements have been based, so far as concernsaircraft production, on the needs of the July programme of the Ministry of aircraft Production. For their September programme another 100,000 &apos;menand women would be needed up to the end of June 1942; and if approval is givento the supplementary programme now under discussion this additional require-;ment will probably be raised to about 300,000.To meet the demands for additional women, it is proposed that some 345,000should be withdrawn from the less essential industries. A large balance will still have to be found by a more intensive recruitment of women outside industry women in domestic service, unoccupied single women and, for the industrial needs,the very large, and hitherto almost untapped, reserve of unoccupied marriedwomen.7. We are thus faced with the task, not only of replacing the men with-drawn from the munitions industries into the Forces, but also of finding verylarge numbers of additional workers, men and women, to fulfil the expandedsupply programmes.All the men, and a considerable proportion of the women, required by the munitions industries must be drawn from the less essential industries. For that reason, it would be difficult to raise above 205,000 the contribution which the less essential industries are to make towards the men required for the Forces.8. The withdrawal of 199,000 men from the munitions industries would however, impose a very severe strain on our war production. I have thereforediscussed with the Ministers responsible for the Services and the Supply Depart-ments whether we can meet the demands of the Services, in full and within thetime limit set, without prejudicing the capacity of industry to equip those forces and to fulfil our commitments to our Allies.It has been accepted policy that the rate at which men are taken into theServices shall be closely related to the rate at which the necessary equipment canbe provided. Before the Russian campaign, the equipment position was such asto warrant increases in the size of the Army which have now been authorised;and the Secretary of State for War still takes the view that, if the Army is raised to the new ceiling by the end of June 1942, sufficient equipment will beavailable for the new entrants by the time they are trained to use it. For mypart, I believe that the supply position must be substantially affected by the cumulative effect of the loss of equipment implied by British and American aid to Russia, the dislocation of production involved by the withdrawal of largenumbers of men from our munitions industries, and the additional requirements
of an expanded programme of aircraft production.   I consider that, unless somet relief is afforded to the munitions industries, there will be a real risk that theproposed intake of men into the Services may outrun the provision of equipment.9. I therefore put forward the following proposals, designed to relieve,directly or indirectly, the strain which would otherwise fall on the munitions industries and other essential undertakings : (a) Young men should in future be called up at age 18^, instead of 19. Thiswill produce, in the year ending June 1942 about 70,000. It will go far to offset the additional 69,000 which the Ministry of Labour had proposed to withdraw from the munitions industries.A large proportion of this age-group will be required by theArmy. Under the National Service Acts, however, men have a statutory right to express a preference for the Royal Navy, the RoyalAir Force, or the Civil Defence Services. The Air Ministry shouldnot, therefore, be at liberty to employ special publicity measures designed to induce them on registering to express a preference for theR.A.F. And, although the principle of self-selection is establishedby statute, it is open to question whether the R.A.F. should not confine their intake to men prepared to undertake flying duties, except in thecase of members of the A..T.C. and possibly wireless operators.The War Office will take special steps to observe the spirit ofthe Government pledge that youths under 20 shall not be sent over-seas ; and they will also try to keep these young men together duringthe early part of their training rather than scatter them throughunits consisting mainly of older men.(b) The man-power demands of the Navy are closely related to the pro-gramme of naval construction; and those of the Army are based ona ceiling figure recently authorised by the Prime Minister.The demands made on behalf of the Air Force and Civil Defencehave not yet been subjected to the same scrutiny.The question whether any adjustment can be made in the AirForce demands is, I suggest, a matter for consideration by the DefenceCommittee.I am discussing the Civil Defence figures with the Minister ofHome Security and will report the result to the War Cabinet.(c) The proposals of the Ministry of Labour are based on the assumptionthat the man-power demands of the Army must be met by the end ofJune 1942. The essential industries would derive substantial relief from the postponement of this date to September for large numbersof men could then be left in industry during the period of maximum production in June and July.I therefore recommend that the rate of intake Into the army should, if possible, be slowed down so,as to spread over until the endof September 1942 the withdrawal of men from essential industries.The effect of this proposal would be to reduce the additionalnumbers required for the Forces up to June 1942 from 361,000 to:284,000. It is proposed that 50.000 of .the 284,000 should come fromyoung -men aged 18-J- (under present arrangements the remaining20,000 of this class would be earmarked for the Air Force and wouldnot be called up until after June 1942), so that only 234;000 would haveto be withdrawn ;from the reserved,and deferred classes.(d) The withdrawal of men from the munitions industries into the forces must be made good without delay -either by substitute labour, menor women, or by reorganisation designed to give equivalent output.The Ministry -of Labour will regard themselves as under an obligation to make substitute labour available as fast as men are with-drawn into the Forces in all cases where the gap cannot be ifilled by measures of reorganisation. Any dispute on this point between theMinistry of Labour and the Supply Department concerned will bereferred to the Production Executive for decision.(e) While the Ministry of Labour are under an obligation to meet in full the man-power demands of the Services, as defined by ,the DefenceCommittee, essential industry has hitherto been left to draw what itcould from the general reserve of labour.[23057] b 2
We have now reached a stage at which apart altogether from-competition for skilled tradesmen the demands of the Services for*men for general service begin to compete with those of the industries onwhich they rely for equipment. I therefore propose that, as soon as theMinistry of Labour find that they cannot satisfy the demands of theServices for men for general service without prejudicing the vitalneeds of essential industry, they should ask the War Cabinet toconsider whether, and to what extent, the demands of the services should be modified.(/) Now that we have reached a condition of acute labour shortage, there isneed of a more precise mechanism of ascertaining the labour needs ofthe Supply Departments and allocating the global numbers required.In my view, it is only by this means that it will be possible to ensure a reasonable balance between the man-power demands of the Servicesand the needs of the industries on which they rely for equipment.I therefore propose that machinery should be devised for settling,under the aegis of the Production Executive, the global needs of theSupply Departments in the light of the general man-power position,so that each Department will know the total labour force which itis likely to have at its disposal and will be able to frame its programmes accordingly. No Department would, of course, beentitled to obtain whatever total of labour it chose to name, and alldemands would have to be related to the practical possibilities of thelabour supply position. But when the needs of a Department hadbeen examined and accepted, it should be able to plan on the basis thatits needs would be supplied up to the limits of its approved total.(g) It ought also to be possible for the Army to make a direct contributionto the man-power problem by supplementing the labour force availablefor the civil sector.I propose that the War Office should explore forthwith, in consul-tation with the Ministry of Labour, the possibility of devising ascheme by which fully-trained men in the Army at home would be released, as individuals, to return for a period to their skilled workin the munitions industries out of uniform and on civilian rates of pay on the understanding that they could be recalled to the Coloursat a momenfs notice in case of need.If a large Army is maintained in this country for any con-siderable further period without being engaged in active operations,it may become necessary to introduce a scheme of this kind on an extensive scale. It should be practicable to apply such a scheme inthe near future to a relatively small number of men on an experi-mental basis.(h) The Army could also make a more immediate contribution by makingmilitary labour available to the civil authorities in an emergency andby carrying out certain special types of work which can conveniently be undertaken by military units.I recognise that there are disadvantages, from the military pointof view, in employing military units on civil labouring work; but theshortage of man-power is now so acute that there are powerful argu-ments in favour of making use of military labour where it canconveniently be used to relieve the position.It is accepted that the Army should give such assistance in emergency, and it does so. I suggest that, without asking the army to undertake such work as a matter of routine, we might at leastextend the principle so far as to authorise the Army to employ militaryunits on civil work in cases where civilian labour is not available.(i) I also recommend that the possibility should be explored of making further use of Italian prisoners of war.The Security Service have modified their previous attitudetowards proposals that these prisoners should be released on parolefor labouring work; and, although the Minister of Agriculture is notat present in favour of allowing them to live and work individuallyon the farms, it should be possible to devise some plan by which their
services could be put to more profitable use in meeting the shortage ofagricultural labour. If this could be done, it would be possible tobring larger numbers of these prisoners to this country.10. These measures should, in the aggregate, relieve substantially the burdenthrown upon essential industry in meeting the needs of the Services.There remains the problem of finding new labour to increase the supply forthe munitions industries and to replace, so far as necessary for minimum working,the considerable numbers of workers that will have to be withdrawn from the less essential industries. For this purpose a far more extensive call will have to bemade on the services of women.(a) Mobile women, i.e., mainly the unmarried or childless. Greater effortswill be needed to ensure that all women in this class make their contri-bution to the war effort. Examples are the withdrawal of the special privileges hitherto enjoyed by wives of men in the Services, and thetransfer of young women from domestic service.(&amp;) Non-mobile women. Special steps will have to be taken to secure asubstantial extension of the employment of married women in industry possibly on a part-time basis, as, for example, by the system by which two women share an eight-hour shift, each working four hours. This is the largest reservoir of labour yet untapped, and itoffers the largest single source of labour supply.11. To carry through this substantial redistribution of labour further powers of direction and control will be required.The Minister of Labour is contemplating the introduction of legislationimposing on all persons, men and women, between the ages of 18 and 60 an obliga-tion to undertake some form of national service. Apart from the advantages that this would bring in providing older men for non-combatant duties in theForces and for industrial work of national importance, the existence of such a statutory obligation would greatly simplify the task of the Ministry of labour in recruiting the numbers of young women required for the Services and forsubstitution in industry.12. The withdrawal of large numbers of men and women from the indus-tries and services supplying civilian needs will involve a large measure ofdislocation which will occasion inconvenience and even hardship for the civilpopulation. This may have a serious effect on morale unless it can be shown thatthe most rigorous economy in the use of man-power is being enforced in theServices and in essential industry.It is proposed that the Production Executive should appoint a PermanentInspection Commission on the use of labour, whose function it would be to carryout continuous investigation into the possibilities of securing man-powereconomies in industry.I propose that the Service Ministers should consider what corresponding action can be taken to enforce man-power economy in the fighting Forces.13. My purpose in putting these proposals before the War Cabinet at thisstage is to seek approval for this general line of approach to the man-powerproblem.   In particular, I would ask my colleagues (a) To take note of the magnitude of the man-power problem, as shown bythe figures quoted in the Appendix and in paragraphs X and 6 above.(&amp;) To approve the proposal to abandon the system of block reservation byoccupation, in favour of a system of individual deferment, and themachinery suggested for carrying through the new system of individualdeferment (paragraph 4).(c) To approve the specific measures suggested in paragraph 9 for relieving the strain which would otherwise be imposed on the munitions industries; in particular  -(i) the proposal that young men should in future be called up stage 18-1 (paragraph 9 (a));(ii) the suggestion that the intake of men into the Army should bespread over until September 1942 (paragraph 9 (c)); and
(iii) the proposed introduction of a system by which the labour *requirements of the Supply Departments would be settled, in &apos;the light of the man-power position, so as to ensure a reasonable balance between the man-power demands of the Services andthose of the industries on which they rely for equipment(paragraph 9 (e) and (/)).(d) To take note of the need for special measures to draw into industry largenumbers of women, particularly unoccupied married women (para-graph 10).(e) To approve the proposal for new legislation imposing on all personsbetween the ages of 18 and 60 an obligation to undertake some formof national service (paragraph 11).Unless drastic measures are taken on the lines indicated in this memorandum,I do not believe that it will be possible to find the man-power required for thefighting Services, for the industries essential to the war effort, and for otherindustries and services supplying civilian needs. If, however, these proposals are accepted, and vigorous steps are taken to implement them, the man-power resources available should suffice to meet all reasonable, requirements which are likely to arise within the period under review.If the general scheme of these proposals is approved, the application of thescheme can be worked out in further detail by the Ministers concerned.J.

Men required for the munitions industries, both to replace the 130,000who are being taken into the Forces under existing arrangements, and to providenew labour, must be withdrawn from the other industries.

Women are needed for the Services, for the expansion of the munitions industries, and for replacement of men in all industries. The net requirement forthe Services and the munitions industries (including the expanded aircraft pro-gramme) is over 1 million : the total need will be considerably greater. Recruit-ment from the 3,700,000 in less essential industries cannot meet the whole of this;although mobile women will have to be withdrawn from these industries on aconsiderable scale, they must be in part replaced.
