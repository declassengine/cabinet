THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.SECRET.W.P. (41) 257.November 7, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK and KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.Copy No.      29WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council., 1. SINCE I circulated my memorandum (W.P. (41) 247) on the 27th october the Prime Minister has discussed various aspects of the man-power problem withthe Ministers primarily concerned. I think it will be for the convenience of theWar Cabinet if I circulate this further memorandum, revised and brought up todate in the light of those discussions.2. The demands of the Services have been reduced in certain respects as aresult of the Prime Minister&apos;s discussions.The Air Ministry have agreed that, in view of adjustments in the rate of expansion of the Air Force, their demands for men can be reduced from 247,000to 200,000.The Ministry of Home Security have been asked to make immediate enquiry into the possibility of supplementing the National Fire Service by arrangementsfor securing the assistance, in an emergency, of Army and Air Force unitsstationed in the neighbourhood; and it is hoped that it may be possible to reducethe requirements of the Civil Defence Services for men from 67,000 to 37,000.On this basis the numbers of men and women now required during the12 months ending June 1942 are as follows :  M en. Women.Navy          ...      ......      ...      110,000 11,000Army         ............      405,000* 205,000Air Force............      200,000 140,000Civil Defence       .........        37,000 106,0001752,000 462,0003. Although the Air Force demands have been reduced by 47,000, this doesnot automatically reduce by the same amount the gross numbers to be suppliedlor all Services during the period. For of this 47,000 some 26,000 have alreadybeen selected for the Air Force, and, as previous experience has shown, these could not now be diverted to the Army without causing serious discontent.* Excluding Army tradesmen.f Including Women&apos;s Land Army and certain other Services.[23057a] b
The gross numbers of men to be supplied are, therefore, 778,000.   Undeexisting arrangements the available supply (including the first half of the 1923class) is 468,000.   If the requirements are to be met in full, a further 310 000 &apos;men will have to be found from among the 3,500,000 fit men aged 18-40 still incivil life.4. The Ministry of Labour therefore propose to abandon the system of blockreservation by occupation in favour of a system of individual deferment.The age of reservation for all occupations will be raised by one year at a time \at monthly intervals, individual deferment being granted only to men engaged -on work of vital national importance. P rtBy this means, and by a drastic review of all existing deferments, theMinistry of Labour expect to find the balance of 310,000 men needed for theForces.The system of block reservation has served its purpose; and, now that theshortage of man-power has become acute, it is clearly necessary to use the finerand more flexible instrument of individual deferment. This change will however, throw a heavy additional burden on the administrative machine of theMinistry of Labour, and a large measure of decentralisation will be necessary.My proposals assume that it will be possible to devise effective machinery forcombing out from the reserved occupations the large numbers who are notindividually indispensable to industry, and that the Ministry of Labour will have full and continuing support from the Supply Ministries and other interested departments in their efforts to withdraw these men into the Forces. The Ministerof Labour has circulated a separate paper (W.P. (41) 249) describing the natureof the machinery which he proposes to establish for this purpose.5. If the whole of these 310,000 were to be withdrawn from industry, theMinistry of Labour would propose that they should be withdrawn, by individualselection, in roughly the following proportions: From the 1,170,000 fit men of military age in the munitions industries      ...      ...      ...       ... 18,000From the 1,430,000 fit men of military age in other essential industries and services (e.g., agricul-ture, transport, &amp;c.)       ...      ...      ...       ... 87,000From the 900,000 fit men of military age in the less essential industries and services        ...       ... 205,0006. Comparatively few of the 310,000 additional men to be withdrawn from industry up to the end of June 1942 would thus come from the munitions industries. But it must be remembered that arrangements have already been madefor some 130,000 unreserved men to be withdrawn from those industries duringthe period under review, mostly before the end of December 1941. Probably halfof this number have already been withdrawn.Moreover, the munitions industries will themselves require an additional315,000 men in the period ending June 1942.Large numbers of women will also be needed For the Services (including Civil Defence) ... 462,000For the munitions industries   ...      ...       ...     460,000Total      ............       ...     922,000- Father, the industrial requirements have been based, so far as concernsaircraft production, on the needs of the July programme of the Ministry of aircraft Production. For their September programme another 100,000 menand women will be needed up to the end of June 1942; and if approval weregiven to the supplementary programme now under discussion this additionalrequirement might be raised to nearly 300,000.To meet the demands for additional women, it is proposed that some 345,000should be withdrawn from the less essential industries. A large balance will still have to be found by a more intensive recruitment of women outside industry-women m domestic service, unoccupied single women and, for the industrial needs,the very large, and hitherto almost untapped, reserve of unoccupied marriedwomen. 1
7   We are thus faced with the task, not only of replacing the men with- i b 4; ,awn from industry into the Forces, but also of rinding very large numbers ofIditional workers, men and women, to fulfil the expanded supply programmes.g    Most of the men, and a considerable proportion of the women, required bythe munitions industries must be drawn from the less essential industries.8 A heavy strain will be thrown on industry by the withdrawal of theseHen into the Forces, and by the dislocation involved in the transfer of workers from the less essential to the more essential industries and in the absorption oflarge numbers of &quot; unoccupied &quot; women.We must also take into account the loss of equipment implied by British and american aid to Russia, and the additional requirements of an expandedprogramme of aircraft production.&amp;In these circumstances I suggest that, if we are to preserve a due balance between the demands of the Forces and the needs of production, some further measures should be taken to relieve the strain which would otherwise be thrown on industry.9.   I make the following proposals: (a) Young men should in future be called up at age 18-1, instead of 19.   Thenumbers available, in the year ending June 1942, would be about70,000 though not all of these would be called up during the periodunless special arrangements were made (see (b) below).The War Office will take special steps to observe the spirit ofthe Government pledge that youths under 20 shall not be sent over-seas.(b) A large number of the young men called up at age 18-J- will be requiredfor the Army. Under the National Service Acts, however, men havea statutory right to express a preference for the Navy, the Air force or the Civil Defence Services. The Air Ministry should not, therefore,be at liberty to employ special publicity measures to induce theseyoung men on registering to express a preference for the Air Force.And, although there is a statutory right to express a preference,I recommend that the Air Force should confine their intake from this class to men prepared to undertake flying duties, except in the caseof members of the A.T.C. and possibly wireless operators.Under present arrangements, only 29,000. of the young men called up at age 18-g would be available to meet the total demands of theServices. The remaining 41,000 of this class would be earmarked forthe Air Force, and would not be called up until after June 1942.As the Air Force will have a surplus of 26,000&apos; older men alreadyselected and awaiting calling up (see paragraph 3 above), I recommendthat the Air Force intake of young men from the whole of the 1923class (both those called up at 18-g and those called up at 19) shouldbe limited to a maximum of 52,000 (instead of the 82,000 which wouldbe allocated to them under present arrangements). This would mean that an additional 30,000 men would be available for the Navy andthe Army.If the proposals in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) were adopted,the numbers of men to be withdrawn from the reserved and deferredclasses would be reduced by 59,000.(c) The Ministry of Labour estimates have been based on the assumptionthat the Army is to be raised to its new ceiling by the end ofJune 1942. The essential industries would derive substantial relief from the postponement of this date to September for large numbersof men could then be left in industry during the period of maximum production in June and July.I therefore recommend that the rate of intake into the army should, if possible, be slowed down so as to spread over until the endof September 1942 the withdrawal of men from essential industries.The effect of this proposal would be to reduce the numbers tobe withdrawn from the reserved and deferred classes by a further77,000.(d) Any withdrawal of men from the munitions industries into the forces must be made good without delay either by substitute labour, menor women, or by reorganisation designed to give equivalent output.[23057] &apos; &apos; B 2
The Ministry of Labour will regard themselves as under an obligation to make substitute labour available as fast as men are withdrawn into the Forces in all cases where the gap cannot be filled bvmeasures of reorganisation. The extent to which labour deficienciescan be met by reorganisation will be a matter for discussion betweenthe Ministry of Labour and the Supply Departments concernedthrough the machinery of the Production Executive. In the event of disagreement, reference can be made to the Lord presidents committee or the War Cabinet.(e) While the Ministry of Labour are under an obligation to meet in full the man-power demands of the Services, as defined by the DefenceCommittee, essential industry has hitherto been left to draw what itcould from the general reserve of labour.We have now reached a stage at which apart altogether fromcompetition for skilled tradesmen the demands of the Services formen for general service begin to compete with those of the industries onwhich they rely for equipment. I therefore propose that, as soon as theMinistry of Labour find that they cannot satisfy the demands of theServices for men for general service without prejudicing the vitalneeds of essential industry, they should ask the War Cabinet toconsider whether, and to what extent, the demands of the services should be modified.(/) Now that we have reached a condition of acute labour shortage, there isneed of a more precise mechanism of ascertaining the labour needs ofthe Supply Departments and allocating the global numbers required.In my view, it is only by this means that it will be possible to ensure a reasonable balance between the man-power demands of the Servicesand the needs of the industries on which they rely for equipment.I therefore propose that machinery should be devised for settling,under the a^aegis of the Production Executive, the global needs of theSupply Departments in the light of the general man-power position,so that each Department will know the total labour force which itis likely to have at its disposal and will be able to frame its programmes accordingly. All demands for labour would, of course,have to be related to the practical possibilities of the labour supply position. But when the needs of a Department had been examined and accepted, it should be able to plan on the basis that its needs wouldbe supplied up to the limits of its approved total.(g) It ought also to be possible for the Army to make a direct contributionto the man-power problem by supplementing the labour force availablefor the civil sector.I propose that the War Office should explore forthwith, in consul-tation with the Ministry of Labour, the possibility of devising ascheme by which fully-trained men in the Army at home would be released, as individuals, to return for a period to their skilled workin the munitions industries out of uniform and on civilian rates of pay on the understanding that they could be recalled to the Coloursat a moment&apos;s notice in case of need.If a large Army is maintained in this country for any con-siderable further period without being engaged in active operations,it may become necessary to introduce a scheme of this kind on an extensive scale. It should be practicable to apply such a scheme mthe near future to a relatively small number of men on an experi-mental basis.(h) The Army has given generous help to the civil power in emergency.There are obvious disadvantages, from the military point of view,in employing military labour on civil labouring work, and there canbe no general recourse to this expedient. But the shortage of man-power is now so acute that there are strong arguments in favour oiemploying military units on civil work in certain special cases wherecivilian labour is unobtainable.I suggest that such cases should be considered on their merits, onthe understanding that the Army is not called upon to undertake sucliwork as a matter of routine, and that there is no undue interferencewith military training.
(i) I also recommend that the possibility should be explored of making further use of Italian prisoners of war.The Security Service have modified their previous attitudetowards proposals that these prisoners should be released on parolefor labouring work; and, although the Minister of Agriculture doesnot think it likely that arrangements can be made for any largenumbers to live and work individually on the farms, it should bepossible to devise some plan by which their services could be put to more profitable use in meeting the shortage of agricultural labour. Ifthis could be done, if would be possible to bring larger numbers ofthese prisoners to this country.10. If the War Cabinet accept the proposals made in (ct,)-(c) of para-graph 9 above, it will be possible to reduce from 310,000 to 174,000 the numbersof additional men to be found from the reserved and deferred classes in industry by the end of June 1942. The plans of the Ministry of Labour, as summarised in paragraph 5 above, could then be substantially modified; and the great majorityof the 174,000 additional men required could no doubt be provided from amongthe 900,000 fit men of military age in the less essential industries and services.The effect of the remaining proposals in paragraph 9 would be less direct, and cannot readily be estimated statistically; but there is no doubt that all these measures, in the aggregate, would relieve substantially the burden thrown on industry in meeting the needs of the Services.Nevertheless, large numbers of men and women will have to be withdrawnfrom the industries and services supplying civilian needs, and this will involvea large measure of dislocation which will occasion inconvenience and even hard-ship for the civil- population. This may have a serious effect on morale, unless itcan be shown that the most rigorous economy in the use of man-power is beingenforced in the Services and in essential industry. This is a matter to whichclose and continuing attention must be given by the Service Departments and theDepartments concerned with essential industry, in consultation with the Ministryof Labour.11. There remains the problem of finding new labour to increase the supply for the munitions industries and to replace, so far as necessary for minimumworking, the considerable numbers of workers that will have to be withdrawn fromthe less essential industries. For this purpose a far more extensive call will haveto be made on the services of women.(a) Mobile women, i.e., mainly the unmarried or childless. Greater effortswill be needed to ensure that all women in this class make their contri-bution to the war effort. Examples are the withdrawal of the special privileges hitherto enjoyed by wives of men in the Services, and thetransfer of young women from domestic service.(&amp;) Non-mobile women. Special steps will have to be taken to secure asubstantial extension of the employment of married women in industry-possibly on a part-time basis, as, for example, by the system by which two women share an eight-hour shift, each working&quot; four hours. This is the largest reservoir of labour yet untapped, and itoffers the largest single source of labour supply.12. To carry through this substantial redistribution of labour further powers of direction and control will probably be necessary.The Minister of Labour has proposed new legislation imposing on all persons,men and women, between the ages of 18 and 60 an obligation to undertake some form of national service. The advantages of such legislation would be twofold.The raising of the age for military service would enable the Minister of labour to.find older men to undertake non-combatant duties in the Forces instead of young women, who are more adaptable and can more profitably be employed in industry. Secondly, the introduction of such a general statutory obligation wouldsimplify the problem of recruiting the large additional numbers of womenrequired for the Services and for industry.
A measure of compulsion has already been applied to women, by the systemof &quot; direction &quot; into specified industrial employment. The question now is, howfar the compulsory principle should be extended. If it is decided not to proceedwith the proposal for comprehensive legislation, there are three possible courses: (a) The Minister of Labour already has power to direct a woman to takespecified employment in industry; and this system is working satis-factorily.The Minister has been advised, however, that under his existing powers he cannot direct a woman to enter one of the auxiliary services. He has sought to overcome this difficulty by indicating, in suitable cases, that unless a woman joined one of the auxiliary services she would be directed to take work in a munitions industry.It may be thought inexpedient to apply more than this indirectpressure though the Minister of Labour takes the view that thenumbers required cannot be obtained by this method.(&amp;) The Minister of Labour could be empowered, by amending legislation,to direct women, individually, to enter one of the auxiliary Services.The Minister of Labour does not favour this course, as it would bedifficult to combine with it the statutory safeguards applicable to theconscription of men for military service, e.g., those relating toconscientious objection and hardship.(c) New legislation could be introduced applying to women the same systemof compulsory service as is applied to men by the National service acts. Women would then be called up, by age-groups, for the auxiliary services. Married women would not be called up, and women called up would not be required to serve on gun stations unless theyvolunteered for this duty. The procedure would be assimilated as nearly as possible to that applicable to the calling up of men formilitary service including provision for exemption on grounds ofconscientious objection, postponement on account of hardship anddeferment for women doing valuable work in reserved occupations.13.   The matters for specific decision by the War Cabinet are : (a) The proposal to abandon the system of block reservation byoccupation, in favour of a system of individual deferment, and themachinery suggested for carrying through the new system of individualdeferment (paragraph 4).(&amp;) The specific measures suggested in paragraph 9 for relieving the strainwhich would otherwise be imposed on industry, in particular (i) the proposal that young men should in future be called up stage 18-^ (paragraph 9 (a));(ii) the proposal that the Air Force intake from the 1923 class shouldbe limited to 52,000 men (paragraph 9 (&amp;));(iii) the suggestion that the intake of men into the Army should bespread over until September 1942 (paragraph 9 (c)); and(iv) the proposed introduction of a system by which the labour requirements of the Supply Departments would be settled, inthe light of the man-power position, so as to ensure a reasonable balance between the man-power demands of the Services andthose of the industries on which they rely for equipment(paragraph 9 (e) and (/)).(c) The proposal for new legislation imposing on all persons between the ages of 18 and 60 an obligation to undertake some form of nationalservice (paragraph 12).(d) The extent to which compulsion shall be applied in the recruitment ofwomen to the auxiliary Services (paragraph 12).
14.   I would also ask my colleagues to take note of : (&amp;) The magnitude of the man-power problem, as shown by the figures givenin the Appendix and in paragraphs 2 and 6 above.(6) The importance of rigorous economy in the use of man-power in theServices and in essential industry (paragraph 10).(c) The need for special measures to draw into industry large numbers ofadditional women, particularly unoccupied married women (para-graph 11).15. When the War Cabinet have taken decisions on the points summarised in paragraph 13 above, the application of the scheme will be worked out in furtherdetail by the Ministers concerned.J.

The additional men required for the Services must come from the3^ million fit men shown in Table II. If none are to be withdrawn from munitions, the whole must come from the 2,330,000 men in other industries, ofwhom only 900,000 are in less essential industries.2. Men required for the munitions industries, both to replace the 130,000who are being taken into the Forces under existing arrangements, and to providenew labour, must be withdrawn from the other industries. Including the newrequirements for aircraft production, the total numbers involved will be at least500,000. These must be found largely from the 4,447,000 men in less essential industries.3. Women are needed for the Services, for the expansion of the munitions industries, and for replacement of men in all industries. The net requirement forthe Services and the munitions industries (including the expanded aircraft pro-gramme) is over 1 million : the total need will be considerably greater. Recruit-ment from the 3,700,000 in less essential industries cannot meet the whole of this;although mobile women will have to be withdrawn from these industries on aconsiderable scale, they must be in part replaced. These replacements, togetherwith a large part of the requirement for the munitions industries, must be drawn from the 11,000,000 &quot; unoccupied &quot; women.* Agriculture ; Mining ; National and Local Government (excluding Civil defence services) ; Gas, Water and Electricity Supply ; Transport ; Food, Drink and Tobacco.f Including about 1,000,000 private domestic servants and about 9,000,000 married women.
