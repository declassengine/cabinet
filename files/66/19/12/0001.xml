A. FREE FRENCH.(i) Navy.Ships recently Commissioned.The six Flower Class Corvettes previously referred to are now in commission.Three of these are allocated to the Newfoundland Escort Force and three toEscort duties in the Western Approaches.Two more Corvettes have been transferred to the Free French to meet Admiral Muselier&apos;s wishes to strengthen his force in West Africa. The first of these is already in commission and the other will be before the end of the year. Admiral Muselier has proposed that when they proceed to Pointe Noire they may be accom-panied by two of the Chasseurs now based on Cowes.Four Motor Launches have been commissioned and are now serving in theMX. Flotilla at Portland. A ceremony was held at Weymouth at which the boats were blessed by the French Chaplain in the presence of Admiral Muselier.Young and inexperienced officers were at first a cause of some anxiety, but now that the boats have worked up a general improvement has been noticed andco-operation with the British-manned boats is becoming satisfactory.The manning of a further four M.L.&apos;s by the French is under consideration,and if this is accomplished an entirely French-manned Flotilla could be formed.The Submarine Junon, which has been undergoing an extensive refit atDevonport, has been brought into service.Syria.The question of the control of the Syrian Ports, and which French Ships maybe sent there, is still a matter on which a final decision is awaited, but thingsappear to be running smoothly.Pacific.The Destroyer Triomphant has taken the Free French High Commissioner,-Captain d&apos;Argenlieu, and Commander Cabanier, D.S.O., who will be Free FrenchSenior Naval Officer, to Noumea. The Triom.phant will then proceed to the eastern mediterranean, where she is expected to arrive by December. The Sloop Chevreuiland the Cap des Palmes, which is to be fitted out in&apos;the United States as an armed Merchant Cruiser, are on their way to the Pacific. The Submarine Surcoufmay also be allocated to this station.Training has been actively continued for Officers and men. In H.M.S. RoyalArthur intensive instruction is being given in English, particularly to mentraining for Wireless and Signals. Their progress, however, is slow. In all, 210French ratings have now passed through this establishment and 110 are now there.Cadets.Eight Cadets have passed out of the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. Theywere very satisfactorily reported on.  Five have joined this term.Recruiting has been going forward steadily. In the last three months 25officers and 250 men have rallied to the FN.F.L.Pay and A llowances.This subject, to which previous reference has been made, has not yet been settled. The length of time taken to settle questions of this sort is to be regretted.Naval Air Force.Training of Personnel for a Free French Naval Fighter Squadron is being-carried out, and it is hoped to man about sixteen aircraft, which will operate under the orders of the R.A.F., before the end of the year. Admiral Muselier hasalways wanted his naval airmen attached to the Fleet Air Arm.Frenchmen in the Royal Navy.Transfers to the Free French during the quarter number 25, including3 officers. There remain 390 French ratings in the Royal Navy. Their morale and discipline are satisfactory.[23005] b 2
(iii) Air Force.1. Outstanding Achievements.One Free French officer pilot is credited with 9 E/A destroyed 2 E/AfStr7ed and-3 E/A damaged.   This officer, flying alone, attackedDunkirk Aerodrome and left a Ju. 88 in flames.   Another officer pilot attacked enemy shipping alone, setting a motor launch on fire. P(ii) Army.Location.Old Dean Command Camp, Camberley.Strength.Officers 69, other ranks 440.Infanterie ale VAir 15, other ranks 69.A accommodation.Reconditioning of the camp is almost finished, the newly-built DetentionBlock has been handed over, covered bays for the tanks are finished, and work has continued satisfactorily on the motor cycle sheds and the men&apos;s dining huts.Roadways are also almost completed. Improvements have also been carried outon the Officers&apos; Mess. New plans for the Sergeants&apos; Mess and the C.O.&apos;s Office(extension) have been drawn up and will shortly be submitted to Area.Employment.Training has been considerably interrupted by the departure of draftsoverseas. Large drafts have been sent to French West Africa in August with a quantity of vehicles and equipment issued to them during the previous quarter.A river crossing exercise was carried out for the first time with the Free french forces. Three officers and three n.c.os. have attended a 3-inch Mortar course atNetheravon in July, and a group of officers attended a demonstration at theBisley S.A.S. of Infantry weapons.A successful trial run of 40-50 miles was made by the tanks in August,and the unit also took part in a 12-mile route march. Signals have had furtherexercises in W/T with co-operation of aircraft, and short courses in W/T weregiven to n.c.os. of the motorized company to enable them to work field sets ifnecessary. A batch of escaped French prisoners from Germany via Russiaarrived on the 10th September, consisting of 14 Officers and 170 other ranks.These men were given a ceremonial reception and inspected by General Petit.They are being refitted and sent on leave of absence, mostly to private houses by arrangements made by the Amis des Volontaires Francais. They should provean invaluable reinforcement.General de Gaulle visited the camp on the 15th September and saw Officers(ex-prisoners of war) returned from Russia.W elf are.The Soldiers&apos; Club at Camberley was opened on the 25th July, and has proved a great success.A football ground has been placed at the disposal of the Free French Forcesat Cordwalles School (neighbouring A.T.S. Depot) on three days a week. Footballand Hockey matches are played on Saturdays.Morale.Continues good. There is, however, a strong desire to participate in someland attack or raid on the Germans in France while these are occupied elsewhere.These desires remain vague, but they are indicative of the general temper of theFrench.
2. Training.During the period under review -35 Free Frenchmen entered Initial Training Wing.13 Free Frenchmen entered Air Observers&apos; School.10 Free Frenchmen entered Signals School.80 Free Frenchmen successfully qualified as service pilots.68 Free  French Maintenance  personnel entered  R.A.F.  School  of technical Training for Conversion Courses to R.A.F. standards in skilled trades.10 Free French airmen entered R.A.F. Schools of Technical training for ab initio training in technical trades.3. Recruiting.During the quarter 104 Free Frenchmen have been enlisted andcommissioned, some volunteers being Tahitians.4. Morale.The morale of Free French pilots serving in R.A.F. Squadrons is good.5. General.General de Brigade Aerienne Martial Valin, who recently returned from theMiddle East, was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Free French Air force on the 4th September.When in the Middle East General Valin visited Free French Units andhelped to control Free French air operations in Syria. It has been agreed thatthe aerodromes at Damascus and Rayak shall be put at the disposal of the free french Air Force. Training in Syria, will comprise courses for WirelessOperators and Air Gunners, and refresher courses for Pilots and Observers.It is proposed to establish a civil Free French air service to operate betweenBeirut and Cairo which will link up with the Egyptian M.I.S.R. service.Instructions have been issued for a Lockheed Lodestar to be handed over tothe Free French during the first week in August, and a second aircraft aboutmid-October for communication work in Equatorial Africa.B. POLISH.(i) Wavy.A crew is being sent to the U.S.A. to take over an American Submarinewhich has been acquired under the Lease-Lend Act. The Destroyer Garlandhas been detached for duties in the Western Mediterranean, where she is expectedto remain for one month. The Submarine Sokol has also left for the western mediterranean, where she may possibly remain for 6 months.It will be recalled that the Commanding Officer of the Submarine Wilkrecently committed suicide and that this event was probably connected with acertain falling off in the discipline of the crew. A new Commanding Officerwas appointed and Captain (S) 9 has now reported that the situation has been completely restored. This submarine has now left Dundee for another flotillaand her departure has been genuinely regretted by the British in the flotilla,who had come to appreciate the efficiency of the Poles and their personal qualities.Thirty-three Polish Midshipmen who have been serving in H.M. Ships havenow been promoted Sub-Lieutenants, and about 15 of these, who are in excess of immediate Polish requirements, will continue to be lent to the Royal Navy. Theoriginal number was 37, but 4 lost their lives in H.M.S. Hood.Those reports which have been received from their British commanding officers have all been very satisfactory and the young officers have been reported as being keen, efficient and popular.Arrangements are in hand to send 3 Polish Lieutenant-Commanders and3 Lieutenants now serving in Destroyers to British Destroyers or Flotilla Leadersfor a few months&apos; training in Fleet work. The experience thus gained shouldbe most valuable when they return to their own Navy, particularly on occasions when Polish and British Destroyers are operating in the same flotilla.Recruiting.The recruiting in Canada has not been up to expectations, and only 30 have so far joined.   Greater success has been met with in South America, where 50
recruits have already been secured and more are expected. From Russia it isestimated that the Polish Navy will get about 200 Naval Ratings who have beenheld prisoner in that country. It is possible that this number may be considerablylarger.Pay.Certain readjustments in the rates of pay have been under discussion between the Polish Naval Authorities and the Admiralty for a considerable time.This matter has now been settled in a manner which it is thought will provesatisfactory.(ii) Army.Officers.

Employment.(a) Exercises.The Polish Forces have taken part in a large number of exercises during thepast three months, the more important being a Command exercise involving alltroops, Home Guards and civil organisations in the Polish sector; providing the&quot;enemy&quot; for dawn attacks on Coast Defence batteries in Angus and Fifecoinciding with naval attacks from the sea and with Home Guards taking part;an exercise during which the R.A.F. provided reconnaissance machines, intercom-munication being by wireless, message dropping and ground strips when the PolishCommander was particularly impressed by the efficiency of the air co-operation.A display of preparatory parachute training was given by the 4th CadreBrigade, followed by an exercise when parachute troops were dropped from threeWhitley bombers in waves of 30 men each with arms and supplies. The exercisewas carried out in a realistic manner.Gas spray training has been carried out with the co-operation of 309 (Polish)Army co-operation squadron.(b) Artillery Practice.Artillery Practice was carried out at Otterburn Practice Camp in July and august and reported on satisfactorily by the Gunnery Staff. Aircraft of 309(Polish) Squadron co-operated.The 4 25-pdr. equipments issued to the Polish Forces are being used at the artillery Training Centre to instruct courses of officers and n.c.os., so that thechange over from 75-mm. equipments should work smoothly when the latter arereplaced by the former.(c) Courses and A ttachments.A large number of officers and n.c.os. have attended courses at our schools and completed attachments to British units, and visits have been arranged to various establishments.
The 3rd A.A. Corps reported on 15 officers who were attached to A.A.divisions that 13 of them were so efficient that it would be a waste of time to send them to our Divisional Schools.General Maczek and Major Koszntski spent a week&apos;s attachment to the 28thArmoured Brigade.48 officers and n.c.o. Cadets from Polish engineer units are doing a 10 days&apos;bridging course at the S.M.E., Ripon.(d) Harvest.Polish troops have assisted in the flax and the grain harvests in Fife and   jAngus, the farmers being pleased with the quality of Polish help. IAssistance is now being given with the potato and beet crop.6. Security.Satisfactory.General Kukiel, the Corps Commander, has issued an order abolishingcensorship except for correspondence abroad.7. Welfare.A large number of film shows and concert parties were arranged for the polish troops, and from 28th to 30th August they were visited by the Royal ArtilleryBand.F.A.N.Y. canteens have been sanctioned by the Area Committee.A branch of the Scottish Polish Society has been founded in Perthshire.8. Morale.Good.9. Recruits.300 recruits have arrived from South America and a further 350 are expectedshortly.  They are kept apart in a training camp at Alyth.10. New Dispositions.New dispositions of the Polish Forces were completed by 1st August to enablethe three regiments of the 10th Cavalry Brigade to be moved into Corps Reservearea to be trained       mobile reserve.11. Medical.Numbers 1 and 2 Polish Hospitals, at Taymouth and Dupplin Castle respec-tively, are working to capacity in a most efficient manner. Since November theformer has dealt with over 2,600 patients and performed over 470 major opera-tions, and the latter with over 800 patients, performing over 100 major operations.10 Polish Army Medical Officers have been approved by the British ArmyMedical Department for Emergency Commissions in the R.A.M.C. and a further3 have been recommended.Endeavours are also being made to find civilian medical posts in scotland for a number of Polish medical officers.12. Polish Officers for West A frica.258 officers have been commissioned in the British Army, including 30R.A.M.C., for service in West Africa.About half this number are due to sail now and the remainder in some three Ito four weeks&apos; time.13. Visits.During the quarter the Polish Forces have been visited by a number of senior officers from the War Office and Home Forces, including the Commander-in-chief and the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Anti-Aircraft Command.Visits to Polish Headquarters in Scotland were made by the Regional and district Commissioners.Further visits to the Polish Forces were made by the Inspector of AlliedContingents, and by Mr. Anthony Eden, Mr. Winant and Mr. Biddle, accom-panied by the American Military Attache.
Whilst in Scotland the Inspector of Allied Contingents visited CoatdykePrison, in which the sentences of Allied soldiers are served. This establishmentappeared to be well managed under a good Commandant, who has got over many small difficulties due to mixed nationalities with tact and firmness. The numberof prisoners is in no case excessive.14. Note by Inspector of Allied Contingents.The Polish contingent has for nearly a year past been responsible for thedefence of the counties of Fife and Angus. Recently they have been able tokeep more units in reserve, and have benefited from the numerous exercises whichthey have carried out, both amongst themselves and with our troops and home guard. The question of organising and equipping them for a more mobile rolehas been under consideration for some time past, and a beginning has been madein supplying them with Tanks with a view to the formation of the Army TankBrigade which is included in their Establishments. The Commander-in-Chief,Home Forces, discussed with General Sikorski the possibility of forming a PolishArmoured Division, but the idea did! not commend itself to the PolishCommander-in-Chief, for the reason that he wishes his troops to remaintogether, and there is indeed a clause to this effect in the agreement between our respective Governments.The Poles have for some time been working at preliminary instruction and exercises for the parachute unit which they hope to train. They have their owntraining ground, and are competent to make a very good show of it. Thedifficulty lies in the short supply of suitable aeroplanes. It is hoped that this may be overcome, as these troops show great aptitude, and some such special training will surely be an integral part of the long-term policy for the use of thePolish Army.Their care and maintenance of the large number of fighting and othervehicles which they now have on charge has been very good and receivedfavourable comment from our own experts who visit them from time to time.On the medical and administrative side the Polish contingent has madeexcellent progress. Their general hospitals at Taymouth Castle and DupplinCastle are functioning admirably, with highly skilled surgical and medicalattendance, and all departments efficiently staffed.(iii) Air Force.1. Re-equipment of Squadrons.During the quarter under reivew there has been no change in the numberof Polish operational Squadrons. The Night Fighter Squadron (No. 307) hasbeen re-equipped with Beaufighters in lieu of Defiants. (This Squadron is atpresent non-operational owing to re-equipment.)Two additional Fighter Squadrons (Nos. 306 and 315) have been re-equipped with Spitfires in place of Hurricanes.The four Polish Bomber -Squadrons have been re-equipped with Mark and Mark IV Wellingtons in place of the earlier type Mark ICs.2. Operations (see also Appendix VII).The four Polish Bomber Squadrons have been employed on long- and medium-range night bombing operations throughout the period under review.During July and August there has, however, been a falling off in operationaleffort of these squadrons due to : (i) The re-equipping of the Squadrons with Wellingtons Mark II andMark TV.(ii) A smaller number of crews available.More recently a reduction in the scale of effort called for from these squadrons, combined with weather conditions too bad for operations, has helped the squadrons to build up their crew strength.3. Outstanding Achievements.(i) On the 26th June, No. 303 Squadron, without loss of pilots, destroyedsix enemy aircraft, of which five were Me. 109 F&apos;s.[23005] c
(ii) On the 14th August, No. 315 Squadron, during one operation, destroyedeight Me. 109&apos;s, probably destroyed one, and damaged another,without loss to themselves.(iii) On the 29th August, a Polish Sergeant Pilot joined formation with a squadron of Me. 109&apos;s, and succeeded in destroying one and breaking up the whole formation. During the same sweep he had previouslydestroyed another Me. 109.4. Training.As was to be expected, Poles now in or about to start pilot and aircrewtraining are not all up to the same high standard as their predecessors, having had a shorter service training before coming to this country. To check a growingincidence of failures in examinations, a R.A.F. Air Crew Training Centre(Polish) will open early in October at R.A.F. Station, Hucknall, to give intensivecourses in English and basic knowledge to all Poles destined to go into flying training through Initial Training Wings, and to strengthen discipline. It isbelieved that this thorough grounding will considerably reduce the percentage offailures and prevent the recurrence in schools of cases of indiscipline which have occurred recently. A passionate desire to get quickly into the air and fight hasinduced in many Poles an impatience with R.A.F. insistence on their first gaininga sound knowledge of subjects such as navigation which are taught mainly in theclassroom. The necessity for this long preliminary training will lead to areduction of the flow of pupil pilots into Elementary Flying Training from about80 to about 50 every 3 or 4 weeks.During the period under review-190 Poles entered No. 12 Initial Training Wing.280 Poles entered Elementary Flying Training Schools direct.65 Poles entered Air Observer Schools.231 Poles entered Air Gunnery Schools.77 Poles entered Signals Schools.190 Poles successfully qualified as Service Pilots.No. 18 (Polish) HeaAW Bomber Operational Training Units passed out during the quarter the equivalent of 66 complete crews for Wellington Aircraft.230 Poles completed their trade training in the Technical Training Wing ofR.A.F. (Polish) Depot, Blackpool, where 114 remain under training. 76 PolishFlight Mechanics are undergoing a Conversion Course to Fitter II in R.A.F.Schools of Technical Training.5. Recruiting.(a) Polish Air Force Mission in North America.A first batch of 80 to 90 volunteers recruited by this Mission is expected toleave early in October for training in the U.K. Of these, 56 are earmarked for^aircrew training (Pilots 43, Observers 4, Air Gunners 9), and the remainder forground trades. The Mission has been authorised to recruit up to 455 Aircrewpersonnel every quarter, and up to a maximum of 100 ground personnel per month.(b) Transfers to Polish A ir Force of Polish Land A rmy Personnel.The Polish Commander-in-Chief has recently authorised the transfer of 40officers and 60 n.c.os. from the Polish Land Army to the Polish Air Force fortraining as observers, wireless operator/ air gunners and air gunners. These areto be selected from 200 volunteers.(c) P.A.F. Personnel ex Russia:A total of between 500 and 700 Polish Air Force personnel may be availablefor evacuation to United Kingdom from Russia. Of these, a first contingent ofabout 180 is expected to arrive in this country about mid-October.(d) Volunteers from South America.42 Polish nationals who have been enlisted in South America are likely to beaccepted for service with the Polish Air Force.
6. Morale.Morale continues to be high.7. Policy.  Operational Employment of Ferry Pilots at Takoradi.The Polish Authorities have given their consent to a number of Polish pilotshitherto employed on the Takoradi Ferry Route being transferred to operationalflying with a R.A.F. Fighter Squadron in the Middle East Command. air officer Commanding-in-Chief, Middle East, has been authorised to employ 12Polish pilots accordingly.8. General.On the 16th July the Polish Air Force Day was celebrated at R.A.F. Station,Swinderby, where General Sikorski, the Polish Commander-in-Chief, presentedcolours to the Polish Air Force, decorated a number of Polish aircrew personnel and promoted several airmen pilots to commissioned rank.Numerous personalities of the Polish Government and Armed Forces werepresent, and the Royal Air Force representatives included the Chief of the AirStaff.C-DUTCH.(i) Navy.The Cruiser van Kinsbergen came to the United Kingdom in Julyfor refit, and on completion has returned to the West Indies. A very satisfactoryreport was received from the Commander-in-Chief, America and West Indies,commenting on the efficiency and keenness of her ship&apos;s compaiTy.The Cruiser Heemskerck and the Destroyer Isaac Sweers, commissionedduring the previous quarter, have both worked up to a highly satisfactorystandard of efficiency.M.G.B. 46 took part in the recent action in the Straits of Dover.The 3 Dutch Submarines attached to 8th Submarine Flotilla at Gibraltar,and whose successes have been mentioned in Appendix I (para. 3), have attaineda high standard of efficiency. They have been maintained without any seriousmechanical defects for the last six months.The behaviour of the men ashore and their relations with the British ratingsare both excellent.Manning Situation.Owing to the situation in the Far East the Netherlands Navy in the Atlantichave not been reinforced by the number of men which they had expected. Conse-quently, it is necessary for them to pay off the Campbeltown and possibly 3 small ships as well, in order to man the new destroyer Noble in October or November.The second new destroyer, the Nonpareil, will, it is hoped, be commissioned beforethe end of the year or early in 1942.Training has been provided for officers and men of the Netherlands Navy,particularly in Minesweeping, Anti-Submarine duties, Signals and M.T.Bs.(ii) Army.Officers.

Employment.Units have proceeded with their individual and collective training.The attendance of officers and n.c.os. to British Courses of Instruction hascontinued, and Liaison Headquarters has arranged a Course of T.Es. W.T. forthe Dutch officers.The 2nd Battalion has been organised as a Training Battalion, carrying outrecruit training on the same lines as a British I.T.C.Since the end of July Dutch troops have also been employed on the diggingof shelter trenches in the Camp, and on a scheme to provide both perimeter andinside defence of the Camp as well as shelter from air bombing.The Dutch Contingent has taken part in a number of exercises during thepast three months, including one in which the Home Guard defences of Birming-ham were tested; an all-day Sunday exercise with the Wolverhampton home guard; acting as invasion troops attacking the defences of Birkenhead, whichwas defended by Home Guards.Assistance has been rendered to farmers during August and September.7. Draft for Overseas.During September a detachment of 3 officers and 59 other ranks, armed and equipped, was despatched to Dutch Guiana to strengthen the defences there, anda further 90 all ranks are standing by for embarkation.8. Canadian Recruits.On the 2nd July, 5 officers and 120 other ranks joined the Dutch Contingentfrom Canada, and on the 10th July they were addressed by the Inspector of AlliedContingents, who welcomed them, telling these new arrivals what was expected3. A accommodation.Since the last report practically the whole of the Dutch Contingent has beentransferred from Congleton to their new camp at Wrottesley Park, nearWolverhampton.4. Organization.

Security.Good.Authority was obtained for the closing of the public road through the Campat Wrottesley Park.10. Welfare.The Dutch Cabaret Party have given performances and the Band of the RoyalNetherlands Brigade gave a series of concerts in London from the 5th to9th August.The Dutch troops have taken part in a number of athletic contests.11. Morale.Good.12. Visits.Her Majesty Queen Wiihelmina and all Ministers of the NetherlandsMinistry have visited the Dutch troops in their new Camp. Visits have alsobeen paid by the Regional Commissioner (Lord Dudley), the General Officer Com-manding-in-Chief, Western Command, and the Inspector of Allied Contingents.13. Command.Colonel Phaaf, Commander of the Brigade, was transferred to the DutchMission in London at the end of August. He was succeeded in command of the brigade by Colonel Van Vourst-Evekink.14. Note by Inspector of Allied Contingents.The Dutch troops have made good progress in recent months, though their training has been cut into by the move to Wrottesley Park, a fine new camp built by the Dutch Government for their troops on the outskirts of Wolverhampton.Owing to the usual contractors&apos; difficulties they have had to move into this placepiecemeal, and to finish off a good deal for themselves work which has seemedmore necessary, and possibly even more attractive, than military exercises. Theyare a promising lot of men, and their young officers and n.c.os. have a very goodreputation at our Army Schools and Courses of Instruction, which they have attended in large numbers. Without any military background, the Dutch soldiersare brave and strong men, are taking to modern methods slowly but thoroughly,and will give a good account of themselves. A working knowledge of English is becoming quite general amongst them, and they pay particular attention to improving this.

Recruiting.A second contingent of Dutch Army personnel has been accepted during theperiod under review for training as pilots in the R.A.F.V.R. Four officers receivedcommissions and 21 airmen were enlisted.
5. Employment.The Czechoslovak Force which has an operational role under the GeneralOfficer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command, has taken part in a numberof exercises during the quarter, including some with British formations, thestandard reached by the Brigade showing marked improvement.The Field Battery and Anti-Tank Battery have carried out an exercise withArtillery of the Western Command. Field Firing exercises for Infantry, Rifle,Automatics and Mortars, and Vickers Machine Gun have been held, in additionto Fire and Movement practices by the two Infantry Battalions, and the machine gun Company on an improvised range in the Malvern Hills.During the quarter, in addition to the attendance of a number of officers andother ranks at Courses in our Schools, the Engineer and Pioneer Sections did alocal course in July under a small party from one of our Field Companies, andthis proved of first-rate value. A signal Course, with beneficial results, was alsoarranged for the Brigade Signal Section and was much appreciated.Assistance has been given to local farmers in harvesting crops.The Company detailed to provide guard duties for the President proceededon the 1st September.6. Security.Satisfactory.7. Welfare.Satisfactory.Steps are being taken to prevent the Y.M.C.A. Canteen with the brigadebeing reduced in category from &quot; A &quot; to &quot; B &quot; as has been recommended, as thiswould inflict hardship on the Czech troops.8. Morale.Good.9. Education.Five British Council instructors of the six authorised, working under theArmy Education authorities, are now employed with the Czechoslovak Contingentin the teaching of English and lecturing to the more advanced students. the help of these instructors has had an excellent effect, and English instruction for officers is now compulsory.10. Visits.Visits to the Czechoslovak Force have been made by the Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, and the Inspector of Allied Contingents.11. Note by the Inspector of Allied Contingents.The Czechs are an admirable body of men, with every type to be found inthe ranks. They are very active and healthy, which is due to their nationalsystem of physical training, raised by them to a cult. They have taken kindlyto our weapons, and are particularly good gunners. They suffer from a totallack of recruits or reinforcements, and are 2,000 under their established strengthof 4,680. They are operationally valuable, with a real offensive spirit, and wellworthy of the equipment which we have given them. Both their Governmentand their command in the field have co-operated with us in every possible way,and they have shown a notable willingness to meet us more than half-way in allthe arrangements which have been made, both in training and administrativematters. It is much to be hoped that some recruits from somewhere will comealong. The Czechs have an operational role in the Defence Scheme of theWestern Command.(ii) Air Force.1. Outstanding Achievements.The Aircrew of a Wellington aircraft of No. 311 Squadron were commendedin Bomber Command Routine Orders A. 59, 1941, for their coolness, courage and.fine airmanship when their aircraft was attacked on the night of the 5/6th July,1941, by a German Fighter over the Dutch Coast.
For gallantry in face of the Enemy, S.-Ldr. J. Ocelka and Sgt. D. Blatnyhave been awarded respectively the D.F.C. and D.F.M., and for great courage inrescuing the occupants of a burning aircraft P.-0. V. Nedved has received theM.B.E.2. Training.During the quarter-37 Czechoslovaks entered I.T.W.16 Czechoslovaks entered E.F.T.S. direct without passing throughInitial Training Wing.9 Czechoslovaks entered Air Observers&apos; School.13 Czechoslovaks entered Air Gunners&apos; School.31 Czechoslovaks successfully qualified as Service pilots.3. Recruiting.During the period under review 51 Czechs were recruited from the Armyand 62 arrived from the Middle East.4. Morale.Fighter Command reports have been most complimentary to the Czech morale.Bomber Command reports that the morale of No. 311 Squadron is good.E. NORWEGIAN.(i) Navy.Ships Recently Commissioned.The Newport is due to commission about the 1st October.Three of the four Corvettes allocated to the Norwegians have now been corn-missioned and will operate from Liverpool.   The fourth is due in October.Two M.T.Bs. have also been manned. M.T.B. 54, which was lent to the norwegians to replace one of these which had engine trouble, sank a 4,000-ton merchant ship.Ten Norwegian whalers have been fitted out at the Cape for Minesweeping.Six of these are now in India and four are at&apos; Port Said.Training.British W/T, Signal and other technical ratings have been provided to help the Norwegians in manning their new ships, but the training of their own ratingsis being carried on, and it is hoped that before long the British ratings will thus be relieved.Six more Norwegian Cadets have joined the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth,this term.In all, 650 Norwegian ratings have been trained at Skegness and 130 are nowthere.Recruiting.Recruiting has been substantial and the Naval Personnel has been increasedby 525 in the last three months. It is thought that the. Admiralty will soon receive a request from the Norwegians for some more ships to man.These recruits, who are mostly men recently escaped from Norway, are of a fine type and keen to fight.  Their good discipline is particularly noteworthy.(ii) Army.Officers.     Other ranks.1. Establishment (Field units and formations) ...      100 2,6002.

Employment.In July the Brigade Headquarters and fighting units were moved from theDumfries Area to the Dornoch Firth-Moray Firth Area on being allotted a newoperational role, leaving the remainder of the Contingent, consisting of theHospital, Workshops and depot companies, at Dumfries. The Field Batteryrejoined the main forces after having had a long attachment to one of our FieldRegiments, from which very great benefit was derived.Soon after reaching their new destination the Norwegians were engaged ohreconnoitring and practising their operational role, as well as attending exercisesand demonstrations. Brigade, battalion and company training have alsocontinued as usual.The infantry H.Q. company and a M.G. platoon were attached during august, and an infantry company and a M.G. platoon during September, to the51st Division for training.During the first week of September the Brigade took part in an Exercisewith British troops, and during the second week the Norwegian BrigadeCommander set and directed an Exercise for the Home Guard and sub-units ofhis Brigade.Officers and other ranks have attended courses. Scottish Command hasarranged on an average 25 vacancies per month for Norwegian officers and other ranks since 1st January last.Norwegian troops have assisted in harvesting. . .6.

8. Morale.Good.The better educated are showing signs of anxiety about the news of recentGerman activity in Norway.9. Recruits.120 recruits have so far arrived at the Depot from the evacuees from Spitz-bergen, and a further batch are expected.10. Visits.Visits to the Norwegian Force have been made by His Majesty the King of norway, accompanied by the Crown Prince; by Judge William Clark, an american, and Mr. Bisikner, British Consul in Cleveland; and by the inspector of Allied Contingents.11. Note by the Inspector of Allied Contingents.The Norwegian Contingent has from time to time sent drafts to their Navy,and has received recruits from the raids on Lofoten and Spitzbergen. The net result is that the contingent is weaker than it was a year ago, and the norwegian government have decided to endeavour to keep their land forces up to a minimumstrength.   They are sending a party to New Georgia.The Norwegian soldiers are attractive men, strong, ha,rdy and healthy, andhave taken very kindly to their weapons and training, especially when oneremembers that they are largely longshore men. They have many of the sailors&apos;qualities, particularly a disregard for comfort, and a gift for improvisation,which add to their fighting value, which is high. Without that natural offensivespirit which comes only from a military tradition, these men are brave and deter-mined, and have a definite operational value. It is always a pleasure to beamongst them. They, like the Dutch, mostly speak intelligible English, and quite a lot have married Scotch girls since coming to this country. They&apos; areperforming a useful role in a protected area, and numbers of them are receivingspecial training at our schools as part of their long-term operational policy.(iii) Air Force.1. Expansion.Norwegian Air Force Order of Battle has increased by one Fighter Squadron(formed 21st July, 1941).2. Operations.(a) Fighter Command.No. 331 Squadron only became operational early in September and no reports as to sorties have yet been received.(b) Coastal Command (No. 330 Squadron).No reports of sorties for period of review have yet been received. this squadron became operational in July, in Iceland.3. Training.During the quarter 14 Norwegian pilots who had successfully completedFlying Training in the Canadian Schools arrived in this country and enteredFighter O.T.Us.4. Recruiting.Norwegian authorities advise that recruiting in United Kingdom and canada is proceeding satisfactorily.5. Morale is excellent.
F. BELGIAN.(i) Navy.Owing to the delay of the Belgian Military authorities in releasing fishermen,the number now in training is less than had been hoped. The total trained inH.M.S. Royal Arthur is now 180 and a further 40 are there at present.The 13 Belgian Cadets who were sent to H.M.S. Royal Arthur for generaltraining and intensive instruction in English have now left. Four have joined the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and the remainder have gone to Greenwich.Two Flower Class Corvettes have been allocated to the Section Beige. It isexpected that they will be completed in December, and by that time sufficienttechnical ratings will have been trained to man the ships entirely with Belgians,with the exception of the Captains and First Lieutenants.There are now thirteen Belgians holding commissions in the Royal Navy,and one Chaplain.(ii) Army.Officers.

Employment.The Belgian Forces which have an operational role in Western Commandare at Malvern with the exception of the 1st Battalion and the Battery, whichare located at Crickhowell, Brecknockshire.The troops have been engaged on normal training, and the erection ofDefence works at Malvern, in addition to taking part in field exercises.Numbers of officers and n.c.os. have attended courses at our schools, and havereceived highly satisfactory reports.7. Command.Lieutenant-General van Strydonck de Burkel, K.C.V.O., relinquishedCommand of the Belgian Brigade on the 9th August on assuming the appoint-ment of Inspector-General of Belgian Land and Air Forces at the Ministry ofNational Defence, London. He was succeeded in command of the troops byLieutenant-General Daufresne de la Chevalerie.8. Canadian Recruits.10 Officers and 174 other ranks joined the Belgian Contingent from Canadaon the 2nd July, and were addressed by the Inspector of Allied Contingents andthe Belgian Defence Minister. A further 2 officers and 24 O.Rs. from Canadajoined in August.9. Security.Satisfactory.10. Welfare.Satisfactory.The use of a good football ground in Malvern has now been obtained.The permanently disabled, originally in the Belgian Hospital at Tenby, arenow installed in a home at Wimbledon under the care of the Belgian Red Cross.11. Morale.Satisfactory.12. Visits.Lieutenant-General Browne, Adjutant-General, Canadian Forces, BrigadierPhelan, Canadian Forces, Baron Silvercrays, the Belgian Minister to Canada,and Lieutenant-General van Strydonck, the Belgian Inspector-General, visited the Belgian troops at Malvern and Crickhowell. These troops were also visitedby the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command, and the inspector of Allied Contingents.13. Noted by Inspector of Allied Contingents.The Belgian contingent has grown more rapidly than any other since their first troops arrived in this country, having increased from 300 to 1,800. Theyhave taken well to our arms and equipment, and show a lively and offensive spiritduring their exercises with our troops.These Belgians are the most restless of our Allies, and swing easily fromdespondency to optimism in their hours off duty and in those interminable political arguments which both officers and men indulge in.   They, more than most,
require something new from time to time to exercise their active minds, andany new equipment or change of employment is a real joy to them. They&apos; sendlarge numbers of officers and n.c.os.-to our school, and get almost universallywell reported on for intelligence and energy. Their new General, though not as yet their Government, wishes to turn their two Infantry Battalions into pedalcyclists, a type of unit with which many of them are familiar. There is muchto be said in favour of having a proportion of push-bicycles with any forecoperating in Western Europe.(iii) Air Force.1. Outstanding Achievements.A Belgian crew serving with No. 235 Squadron has received congratulationsfrom the Air Officer Commanding 18 Group on their fine work in locating adinghy containing the crew of a Whitley, rescue being effected.2. Recruiting.During the quarter ending 14 Belgians have been granted commissions and42 enlisted m the R.A.F.V.R.3. Training.During the quarter 18 Belgians entered Initial Training Wings.33 Belgians successfully qualified as Service pilots.G.-GREEK.Air Force.1. Training.During the quarter arrangements were made and are now in progress forthe training in Southern Rhodesia of Greek flying personnel. It is hoped thatarrangements can be made to train Greek Maintenance personnel in the Unionof South Africa.2. Recruiting.The Greeks are recruiting additional ground personnel from Nationals inEgypt.3. General.Approval has been given to the formation of a Greek Single-Seater fighter squadron (No. 335), which is now in process of being formed. It is hoped to forma second S.S. Fighter Squadron in 1942 if sufficient ground personnel areavailable.H. YUGOSLAV.Air Force.1. Training.Arrangements for the training of Yugoslav aircrew personnel are still underdiscussion, but it has been agreed that some 30 to 40 Yugoslav volunteers in theUnited Kingdom shall be accepted for pilot training in R.A.F. schools in thiscountry.2. General.Arrangements are still under discussion for the disposal of the remainder ofthe Yugoslav personnel and for the recruiting of Yugoslav Nationals to form and maintain two Squadrons for operations in the Middle East.
APPENDIX I.Summary of Morale and Progress of Allied Navies.General.1. General Efficiency.    ,It can be said that&apos; all the Allied Navies have made continued progress in fighting efficiency and that their spirit is excellent and has never been higher.2. Growing Allied Help.There can be no doubt of the really valuable help our Allies are giving us when we see the number of ships they now man.The total number of Allied Officers and men (including Greeks and Yugoslavsbut excluding Russians) is about 14,800 as compared with 13,200 at the end oflast quarter. Numbers are still rising and it is possible that many more alliedseamen will find their way to this country in the future.3. Successes.Outstanding allied successes fall to the Netherlands Navy, Dutch Submarineshaving sunk 8 ships, totalling 40,000 tons during the last few weeks. The award of decorations for these achievements is being proposed on another paper.The French Submarine Rubis, after torpedoing an enemy supply ship,extricated herself from a difficult position, earning the commendation of the flag officer, Submarines.The Norwegian-manned M.T.B. 54 recently sank a 4,000-ton enemy merchant ship.4. Losses.The Norwegian Destroyer Bath, only recently commissioned, was sunk by a torpedo probably meant for one of her convoy, and the Norwegian minesweeperKOS 16 by collision.The Dutch Naval Air Arm lost four aircraft.5. Sightseeing.Some sightseeing has been arranged for the Allied Admirals and their staffs.Visits have been paid to Windsor Castle, Oxford University, Greenwich, also to aircraft, tank and munition factories. The local people always play up well onthese occasions.6. Relations between British and Allied Navies.On the whole our men and the Allies get on very well, although an occasionalreport of unfriendliness is received.There are many people in this country, including quite a number of men inthe British Navy, who have not woken up to the fact that our Allies arecontributing a great deal towards the common effort and therefore treat themless cordially than they otherwise would. The Press (especially local papers at ports) is being approached through M.O.I. to give more publicity to this subject.7. Seniority and Command.The delicate question of command of a mixed group of British and Alliedships where an Allied Officer is the senior has recently been settled by arrange-ment with the Allied Admirals. Normally, Allied Officers are to be considered as being junior to British Officers of the same rank. In special operations whereAllied ships predominate and, under certain conditions in local flotillas whereAllies predominate, consideration will be given to the desirability of placing an allied Officer in command.8. Many Allied seamen are still in the Allied Armies. The war at seaneeds every man of the seaman class. This question is under discussion with theWar Office.
APPENDIX II.Remarks on Welfare of Allied Navies.THE co-operation of the various Seamen&apos;s Welfare organisations throughoutthe country has continued and proves most valuable.The provision of hostels and canteens for Allied seamen has been extendedThe existing arrangements for hospitality to officers and men on leave have proved very satisfactory.The British Council are assisting in the provision of English teachers at various places where personnel of the Allied Navies are to be found.APPENDIX III.Characteristics of Allied Navies.(Various officers in close touch with Allied Navies have collaborated inthis precis.)Free French.Very uneven. More depends on the leader than in any other Navy. A free french ship with a really good captain is sure to become a good fighting unit,whereas a ship with a mediocre captain will probably not be of much use. Wherethe spirit is high and many Free Frenchmen have this spirit it is very highand a real desire to fight goes with it. The Frenchman is at his worst in routinework or when his ship is in dockyard hands. Certain things discourage himeasily. At the same time, his powers of recuperation &quot;are sometimes astonishing.As seamen, many of the men are hard to beat. Officers are often too theoretical.The practical sort can be first class. The French chafe at intensive training and take the attitude that they will be all right &quot; on the day.&quot; The majority have agreat admiration for the British Navy.Dutch.Thorough, dependable, painstaking and slow. Technically up-to-date andhighly efficient. First-class seamanlike and fighting qualities. Officers handletheir ships well. Standard of ship cleanliness generally high. The same maybe said of men&apos;s clothing, but exceptions have been noticed. Organisation and staff work very good. The Dutch Navy needs less &apos;&apos; looking after &apos;&apos; than any ofthe other Allied Navies, even though they have no British Liaison Officer at headquarters.Poles.Alert, keen and efficient, although a lack of method in organisation is some-times apparent. Born fighters. Somewhat temperamental, and this no doubthas something to do with their undoubted charm; but there are drawbacks. one is that it is apt to breed introspection and self pity. Failure in small things is often considered a tragedy. Thus, suicides for little apparent reason are lessuncommon than with many other peoples.The officers are good leaders and handle their ships well. The Poles can probably produce good Staff Officers, but most of the officers at the Polish NavalHeadquarters are not good. Discipline good, except in connexion with certainrecent events. Smartness more developed than in other Allied Navies. Divi-sional work not up to ours., Officers and men are noted for their good manners, and they are undoubtedly the most popular Allies in this country.
Norwegians.Good seamen, but one gets the impression of a man-of-war on Merchant shiplines. Probably tough fighters. Most of the officers and men are slow thinkers,but when they know what they want they usually get it. Staff work seems rathercasual. Discipline casual, but adequate for the standard of efficiency maintained.The men can put away more spirituous liquor than the sailors of most nations.Where, however, the command is good and discipline above the normal, Norwegianseamen show that they can be no less temperate than others.Norwegian ships are usually clean, but hardly smart. The standard of technical efficiency of men trained by us can be high. Both officers and men have been favourably compared with our own in asdic work.Section Beige.The officers are from the Belgian Mercantile Marine, the men mainly fisher-men with a sprinkling of college youths. It is early to say what the officers willbe like, but some of them show promise. The men are surprisingly good. Theyare first-class seamen, anxious to fight, quite smart and are easily led. They arepopular with our men. A Trawler Skipper, when told he was to have a Belgiancrew, was much upset. On being asked his opinion of them after he had hadthem a few weeks he was enthusiastic, and said they were far better than his previous British crew.General.The standard of smartness in the Allied Navies, either as regards ships ormen, is, generally speaking, below ours. The Poles, however, run us close andthe Dutch, on the whole, are not far behind. There are signs now, due no doubtto the fact that many Allied officers and men have been trained in our Establish-ments, that the standard aimed at is higher. If they are not as smart as we are,it must be remembered that some nations at least do not need the outward formsof discipline as much as we do. This applies very much to the French Navy (and army), which, if well led, can give surprising results considering their lack ofsmartness and apparent lack of any discipline.There is another important characteristic in which all the Allied Naviesdiffer from ours, and that is that it is not natural to their officers, as it is to ours,to make the welfare of their men one of their principal considerations. The reallygood type of French officer is human and friendly with subordinates, and when this is so the influence he has over his &apos;&apos; enf ants &apos;&apos; is great.Discipline, too, is maintained differently. It is either happy-go-lucky,punctuated by heavy punishments, as in the Norwegian Navy, or rigid and some-what harsh, as in the Dutch and Polish Navies.Allied officers and men are usually more politically minded than ours. Themajority of regular Allied officers are better educated than our own.The above remarks are not criticisms. Allied circumstances are different from ours and our yardstick may not always be applicable in matters of the abovesort. It would, therefore, be wrong to influence our Allies (if we could) to copyus slavishly. If we succeeded the results they got would probably be inferiorto those they get by their own methods. It is another matter, of course, if theycopy of their own volition certain of our ways. This is happening, and the resulting benefit is marked. Finally, it may be said that the Allied Navies have certain traditions of their own which, however much they admire the british navy, as they undoubtedly do, they do not wish to depart from.i
