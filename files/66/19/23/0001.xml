4 o-h October 1941. COPY NO.  kr- i/tfDT IIN-D-ER-LOCK AND K*b8 tak&apos;     Vba secrecy of this do&amp;umsilWAR CABINET.AMENDMENT OF THE REGENCY ACT.  1917Memorandum by the Home Secretary.The Regency Act of 1937 provides that-if-three out of a group &quot;of five specified people declare in writing that theyare: satisfied Toy evidence that the Sovereign is for.some definite, cause not available, for the performance of theRoyal functions, those, functions shall-&apos;be&quot; performed : by aRegent.&quot;: The five specified people&apos; are the Queen, the Lord .-Chancellor,/-the Speaker, the Lord Chief Justice and.the master of the Rolls./ . &quot;&apos;    sI am advised that the expression &quot;The Sovereign is forsome definite cause not available for the ^performance of theRoyal, functions-!&apos;- has. reference to functions which constitutionally-the Sovereign performs by and with the advice of Ministers.It has been represented to me that in-the-event of an invasion the-&apos; Sovereign might be temporarily cut off fromcommunication with his Ministers and that in an extreme emergencyIt might/he!.Impossible owing to transport or - ether difficulties to assemble at very short-notice three of the-five specifiedpeople.&apos;   - In these circumstances there would be no legal meansof- transferring the exercise of the Royal functions fromthe King to the Regent, with the result that we should be deprived of an essential part of both the normal and theemergency; legislative, machinery.The likelihood of a breakdown of this kind, may not be greatbut it is impossible to foresee the circumstances in which itmay be necessary to invoke the Regency Act, and the riskentailed in having so small a number of people from whom toform a quorum for the purpose of establishing a Regency is not one which should be run at a time when the possibility of invasion has to. be contemplated.I accordingly propose that the Regency Act should be amended by a Defence Regulation so as to provide that if three or more ofthe-specified persons are. not available, a. declaration signed by those: remaining, if any-, and by enough members of the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council to bring the signatories up to three shall have the effect of a, declaration under Section 2 (1)of the. Act.-     If none of the. specif led-, persons is available thedeclaration/will be made by three members of the JudicialCommittee, - but in order that there should be as little departureas. possible from the principle embodied in the Regency Act the regulation:-- provides- that if; any of the persons specified in themp. are available they shall sign the declaration and that any declaration signed by persons not specified in the Regency Act
shall bo &apos; valid- - not in any-and every case when the Sovereign isnot&apos; available for the performance of the Royal functions - butonly if by reason of enemy action he is not available.I have considered -who should be- called in to reinforce thepersons specified by Section 2.. (1) and I think that the membersof the- Judicial Committee are the most appropriate for the purposiLike the four specified persons, other than the Queen, they*arePrivy-Counsellors.     They &quot;are Judicial officers ana are thereforepeculiarly suited to the performance of a quasi-judicial function of this kind.     The Judicial-Committee includes distinguishedDominion judges together with a member or members selected beceusiof their previous connection with,British India and with theColonies and its membership.&apos;is numerous enough to ensure&apos; that a quorum will always be available.&quot;I have not overlooked the possibility that action whichcontemplates the capture, or isolation of the King by enemy, forcesmay be taken to indicate that the Government is lacking in confidence in our ability to master an attempted, invasion]   butI think that the measure can, equally well be represented as an example of foresight on the part of a Government determined tocarry on the struggle in the, most adverse- circumstances.T propose that this aspect of the matter should be givenprominence by means of en arranged Question in the House.I&apos;have consulted the Lord President of the Council and theSecretary of State for Dominion.Affairs who concur in theseproposals and I accordingly, submit-.a Defence Regulation to giveeffect to them for the approval of the&apos;war Cabinet.- -  H.M.HOME OFFICE.28th October 1941.
