THIS document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government /Printed for the War Cabinet.   November 1941./189Copy 29WAR CABINET,POLICY WITH REGARD TO ETHIOPIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I CIRCULATE fox the&apos; information of the War Cabinet a copy of a letter tothe Lord President of the Council setting out the special interests of general smuts and the Union Government in regard to the administration of Ethiopia.Sir John Anderson has told me that the composition of his Committee is hardly such as would enable it to deal adequately with the questions of widerpolicy raised in this letter. He has suggested that I should refer them to theCabinet so that they may be taken into account when the report of his Committeeis under consideration.I UNDERSTAND that you are Chairman of a Cabinet Sub-Committeewhich is charged with making recommendations as to the issues raised in Eden&apos;cabinet Memorandum (W.P. (41) 241) and Margesson&apos;s Memorandum(W.P. (41) 240) in regard to the administration of Ethiopia. I feel, therefore,that I ought to bring to your notice the special interests of General Smuts andthe Union Government in this question. Since the Union forces have taken a prominent part in the conquest of the country, the interest of the Union in its administration and eventual fate is natural, and the question is, in fact, onewhich is being closely watched in the Union and may have political repercussionsthere.General Smuts has communicated with me on various occasions in recent months expressing his interest in the matter. His general view has been that itis of great importance to ensure that the arrangements as to what outsideassistance and guidance may have to be afforded, in the restored Ethiopia, to theEmperor should be kept as provisional as possible in order that the position maybe open, when the time comes for the Peace Conference, to consider the future ofthese parts of Africa. Apart from that, he has emphasised the vital necessity ofthe administration of Ethiopia being sufficiently strong as to ensure that there isno interference with the development of our war effort elsewhere or with complete freedom of movement for our military forces in the East African ^ind middle east areas.From both these points of view he has been in favour of as close control bythe British military administration as is possible, subject to our undertakings tothe Emperor.C.Dominions Office, November 10, 1941.(Secret.)My dear Anderson,November 6, 1941.[23127]
It must be remembered that, in view of the political situation in the Union,General Smuts would himself be in a vulnerable position, if anything wentseriously wrong in Ethiopia at the present time. There has recently been a gooddeal of criticism in South Africa directed against him on the lines that the only result of the activities of the Union expeditionary force to East Africa has so far been the replacement of a backward native ruler on his throne. This line is naturally fostered by the general outlook in South Africa on native questions, andthere was little sympathy in the past with the Emperor as such. If it now cameabout that serious misgovernment, or even disturbances, involving loss of life byEuropeans, took place in Ethiopia after its conquest by us, the effect on publicopinion in South Africa and on General Smuts&apos;s position might well be far-reaching. It is clear, for example, that for purposes of suppressing any suchdisorder we could not rely on military assistance from the Union a second time,and it is perhaps significant that, as we understand, the Union Chief of Staff hasrecently pressed for the recall of all South Africans connected with the presentcivil administration of Ethiopia; they seem, in fact, to be anxious that in theevent of any debacle in Ethiopia, no sort of responsibility could be attached tothem.I should be grateful if the position in the Union in the matter, as I have outlined it above, could be kept in mind by your Committee. The cabinet approved of my keeping General Smuts informed of whatever decisions were reached. On this occasion, I think that, in all the circumstances, it would be best that I should be in a position to advise him in advance of whatever decision we propose to take, rather than inform him after a decision has been taken.Yours sincerely,CRANBORNE.
