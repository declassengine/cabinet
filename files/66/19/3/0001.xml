THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (41) 230. /September 30, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.FAR EASTERN POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.OUR Far Eastern problem, being in essence the problem of dealing with japan, is fundamentally military. Our policy must, therefore, be ^ased primarily on strategic considerations.2. The Far East was last considered as a whole by the Chiefs of Staff inJuly 1940.   The following is quoted from their appreciation : &quot; Committed as we are in Europe and without the help of France, wemust avoid an open clash with Japan. A general settlement includingeconomic concessions to Japan is desirable, but the prospects are not atpresent favourable. Failing this settlement, our general policy must be toplay for time, cede nothing until we must and build up our defences as soonas we can. At the same time we should aim at securing the full military co-operation-operation of the Dutch.&quot;3. This appreciation was written when our fortunes were at their lowestebb. The possibility of a general settlement had been examined but was not practicable, if only because the necessary economic contribution could not be madeby us during the war. Since then we have concentrated on building up ourdefences in Malaya and strengthening our co-operation with the United Statesand the Netherlands. Staff conferences in Singapore have produced joint plansagainst the event of war with Japan. Our assistance to China, as also that givenby the United States, has increased and we have begun discussions with china for mutual assistance in the event of war with Japan.4. Thus stronger reaction to Japanese moves has become possible. NorthIndo-China was occupied with impunity. The occupation of South Indo-china was followed by public warnings by the United States and ourselves, and by the simultaneous introduction of freezing measures by the United States, the BritishEmpire and the Netherlands. In fact the effect of this latest Japanese action has been to form for the first time something resembling a united front in theFar East between these three Powers.5. A new phase of the Far Eastern problem has thus opened. Japan isfaced with the prospect of economic isolation unless she makes a real change in her policy and has now to reckon with the possibility of joint military resistanceby the United States, the Dutch and ourselves, and also by Russia if she makes a move in the north.11498   [22964]
6. There is no sign yet of a change of heart in Japan. There appears, itis true, to be some division of opinion, but this is probably simply between thosewho would press on now with the expansionist policy and those who feel that japan;&apos;s aims can better be secured by temporary compromise with the UnitedStates and ourselves. The recent trend of the United States towards hostilities in the Atlantic must increase the pressure on Japan to free herself from theobligations of the Tripartite Pact. There are, indeed, signs that Japan is alreadynervous lest those obligations should force her into war with the United States.The Japanese hope that the present discussions between themselves and the UnitedStates may gain time until the Russian situation is clearer. Possibly they alsohope to disrupt the front which is forming against them. While we are not fully informed of the progress of the Washington conversations, we can, I think,be confident that they will not produce the second of these results. There is no sign that the Japanese are prepared for a settlement in China which the UnitedSpates could accept, and the American economic pressure on Japan is being fullymaintained.7. The effect of the freezing measures must be to compel the Japanese, atsome date which cannot yet be accurately forecast, to reach a decision as to japan&apos;s future course. We must not exaggerate the effect of these measures norunderestimate Japan&apos;s resources. In many ways, e.g. food supply, she is self-sufficient for perhaps as long as two or three years. There are, however, importantweaknesses notably in oil and non-ferrous metals, such as nickel and aluminium.The oil situation is uncertain and it would be wise to assume that stocks existsufficient for twelve months&apos; requirements on a full war basis. But the general effect of the present restrictions is the more drastic in that the Siberian route isclosed. Virtually no markets other than South America are open to Japan and thetime must come before very long when she must begin to draw upon her warstocks. When Japan reaches the conclusion that that moment is in sight she musteither come to an understanding with the United States and ourselves or breakout, at the risk of war with us both, in order to escape economic strangulation.She is likely to choose according to the amount of combined opposition whichthreatens to confront her.8. Japan no doubt hopes that she will be able to continue the &quot; one by one &quot;policy. In spite of the Chinese war, she could no doubt overrun Siam and operate against Malaya or the Netherlands East Indies. Alternatively, she might attackRussia in the Far East, but in the absence of a complete collapse of Russia itseems doubtful whether she would risk war both in the North and Southsimultaneously, given the constant risk of United States intervention. Normally,Japan would be in a position to choose between these different courses including that of doing nothing for the time being as the development of the war in theWest dictated. The effect of the freezing measures, as shown in paragraph 7, is however, to remove the option to do nothing.9. It is against this general background that we have to decide our generalpolicy and our attitude on the immediate questions which may confront us, andI suggest that, in view of this general situation, a display of firmness is more likely to deter Japan from war than to provoke her to it.10. The warning now given to Japan by the United States is wide enoughto cover Japanese action against Russia and even further action against China.We have for our part said that, if the efforts of the United States to bring abouta settlement in the Far East should fail, we should range ourselves at the sideof the United States. We are therefore pledged to act in the event of action bythe United States Government and it is desirable that concrete measures shouldbe worked out with them in advance.11.   The principal questions immediately before us, however, are three :(a) Siam. We are encouraging the Siamese Government by economic assistance to withstand Japanese pressure. Can we go further andpromise them military aid? We are agreed that in the interests ofour own security we should occupy portions of the Kra Isthmus ifthe Japanese were to enter Northern Siam. But if to forestall usthey direct their first move against the Isthmus itself, shall we opposethem or try to drive them out?
u(b) Russia. What assistance could we give to the Soviet Union if it were attacked by Japan even if the United States took no immediate action ? The Chiefs of Staff have lately concluded (see C.O.S. (41) 583)that it would be inadvisable in this eventuality to declare, war on japan, though if America led we should follow. Apart from thequestion whether it is necessary to declare war in order to help Russia,this conclusion seems to require further review in the light of the wider considerations referred to above, including the danger ofpermitting Japan to apply the &quot; one by one&quot; principle to us in theFar East. There is the still wider question whether on military raswell as political grounds we can afford not to do everything in our power even at some loss to keep Russia going if she is still resistingin the west.(c) A attack on Burma Road. Chiang Kai-shek has been pressing us foractive help in the event of a Japanese drive through Yunnan to cut the Burma Road. Such a drive, if successful, would profoundly impairChinese resistance and would be a threat to Burma. Furtherconsideration of our action if such a threat develops is required,having regard, in particular, to the potentially very considerable effect on Anglo-American co-operation of action on our part toprotect a channel of supply to China in which the United states have so direct an interest.12. For the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs the situation has so changed in the last year that we ought now to view the Far East as a singlefront, and in considering the various items of the problem we may well be ablenow to follow a stronger policy than- that quoted in paragraph 2 of thismemorandum, to which events impelled us in July 1940. If, therefore, mycolleagues agree with the general lines of the present paper, I suggest that theChiefs of Staff be asked to prepare in the light of it a further military appre-ciation of the Far East, with particular reference to our action : (a) In the event of a Japanese incursion into Siam;(b) In the event of a Japanese attack on Russia; and(c) In the event of a Japanese drive through Yunnan against the burma road.A.
