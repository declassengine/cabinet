8th November,  1941.I: WAR CABINETARTICLE IN THE &quot;SUNDAY PICTORIAL&quot;Memorandum &quot;by the Home Secretary.The Cabinet on the 27th October considered an article inthe &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; which had referred in the mostoffensive terms to members of the House of Commons, and agreed that the Home Secretary should (l) enquire whetherthe article constituted a breach of the privilege of theHouse of Commons,  (2) should report whether the articleoffended against the Defence Regulations,  and (3) should consider in consultation with the Lord President and theMinister of Information whether it would be desirable toobtain further powers to deal with articles of this description.1.    As regards breach of privilege I attach a copy of aletter from the Cleric of the House in which he tells me thatif the question of privilege were raised he would have no hesitation in advising the Speaker that there was a prima facie case.    If the view of the Cabinet is that a private member should be encouraged- to raise this issue steps mustbe taken at once since I understand that if a privilegematter is to be brought forward without notice before the- commencement of public business,  it must be brought forv/ardon the earliest possible day,  i.e.  on Tuesday, the11th Novembero2.    On the question of prosecution I have consulted theDirector of Public Prosecutions who says that in his opinion the article does not offend against the existing defence regulations.    He also thinks that it does not offend againstthe common law relating to sedition because &quot;although the writer impliedly advocates a change in the present Government,he does not recommend unlawful or violent means for thepurpose of effecting any such change&quot;.    The Director addsthat he cannot find in the article any material on whichproceedings for criminal libel could be founded.3.    On the question of further powers I have afterconsultation with the Lord President of the Council and theMinister of Information come to the conclusion that noDefence Regulation could be devised which would cover thearticle in question without at the same time covering numerousother criticisms of the administration and raising thecontroversial issue whether the Government is to be clothedwith extensive powers for the control of expressions ofopinion.    However limited may be the use which the Governmentwould make of such powers in practice,  any Regulation whichwould be effective for dealing with such an article as thatin the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot; would have to be so framed as tocover a wide field and would be open to attack on theground that it would empower a Government to exercise amuch more extensive control over expressions of opinion thanthe present Government would in fact exercise or would thinkit right to exercise./I am
I am proposing to circulate at an early date for theconsideration of the cabinet a Memorandum on this question and a Memorandum on&quot;the  question of the censorship of-Press matter likely.-to Be injurious to our foreign:relative ons,  a subject which I was asked by the War Cabinet toconsider in consultation with the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and-the Minister of Information.I am circulating this advance note because the questionof &quot;breach of privilege ought to be considered before themeetingsof Parliament next week.H.M.HOME OFFICE- 8th November,  1941.
... i87COP:.&quot; OF L5TTEP FROM THE .CLSR1C OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.30th October,  1941,I am sending you a note about the &quot;Sunday Pictorial&quot;article, as I promised in our conversation this mornings    Thearticle contains one or two offensive remarks,  such as that about the &quot;buying of seats&quot; and &quot;flabby flotsam&quot;.    But these might not. in themselves amount to a breach of Privilege,  apartfrom the tone of the article as a whole, which I think wouldbe considered by most reasonable people as offensive andinsulting to the House of Commons,The question of the committing of a breach of Privilege,is, however,  a matter for the House itself,   -All that isnecessary to enable the question to be raised in such a way as to take precedence of the ordinary business of the day isthat the Speaker should be satisfied that a prima facie case ofbreach of Privilege has been made out.    In the case of thisparticular article,  I think I should have no hesitation inadvising the Speaker that there was a prima facie case.With regard to the procedure involved,  the matter shouldbe raised after the conclusion .of Questions,,    The Member whoraised it - normally a private Member - having called theattention of the House to the article,  should bring a copy ofthe complete issue of the paper to the Table where the article in question would be read by the Clerk of the House.    Usuallya sentence or two suffices, but in this case it seems to methat the whole article would have to be read.    This isunfortunate but I do not see how it can be avoided,,    After thearticle has been read,  the Member would develop his casebriefly and ask the Speaker for a ruling as to whether a prima facie case had been made out    He would then,  ifnecessary,  continue his argument and must end with an appropriate Motion,,    The usual Motion in such cases is thatthe matter of the complaint be referred to the Committee of privileges,There is a rather awkward difficulty in this case,    as you know, Parliament is being prorogued at the next sitting ofthe House and there would not be time for the Committee of privileges to report on the matter during the present Session.The matter will,  therefore, have to be raised again in thenext Session, but,  if the question of Privilege had been sofar established that the matter- of complaint had been referredto the Committee of Privileges9  the proceedings in the next session would be little more than formalcAn alternative procedure; which has in the past been used in the case of libels on the House,  is for the Memberwho brings forward a complaint of breach of Privilege to conclude with a Motion that the matter of the complaint&quot;constitutes a libel upon Members of the House and is a gross breach of Privilege&apos;&apos;.    This procedure would have theadvantage of disposing of the matter at once without having to carry it forward to the next Session,GiP,lvh  CAMPION,
