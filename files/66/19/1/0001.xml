In my visit to Britain I had several purposes in view. The first wasthe fulfilment of a natural desire to visit the United Kingdom at this time ofwar, and thus to emphasise in the minds of the people in the old land, and before[22932] &apos; this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT&quot; &apos; - -Printed for the War Cabinet.

the&apos; world, Canada&apos;s position at Britain&apos;s side. I wished to supplement myrecent visit to the Canadian Forces in various parts of our country with a visit,however brief, to the fighting men who are upholding the name and honour ofCanada overseas. I was anxious to convey a word of greetings to our soldiers,sailors and airmen from their homes and families and to bring back, as I fortu-nately am able to do, some word of reassurance of their well-being to those whom they have left behind- I desired to renew my friendship with the Prime Ministerof Great Britain and to have the opportunity of personal conference withMr. Churchill and his colleagues, and with professional experts, on questionsof strategy, and in particular matters pertaining to Canada&apos;s war effort. I wasdesirous of seeing and learning at first hand as much as might be possible ofactual conditions in Britain after two years of war. Most of all, perhaps, Iwished, from the point of vantage which Britain provides, to survey in its trueproportions and perspective the scene of world-wide conflict, and to obtain fromthe best-informed sources as accurate a picture as might be possible of the presentposition of the war, its probable trends and duration.&quot;2. These were large and important purposes. Any one of them mightwell have absorbed a much longer time than it was possible for me to give to allcombined. Having, however, from the outset of the war been in closest touchwith the Government of Britain, and having followed in detail from official sources the course of events from day to day, I feel that, short though my stay inEngland necessarily was, it was sufficiently long to meet in considerable part eachof the purposes I had in view,&quot; 3. For obvious reasons, I shall this evening be obliged to restrict suchaccount of my visit, as it may be possible for me to give, to but one of its main objectives, leaving for Parliament, or for other occasions, such further accountof additional features as it may be expected and desirable for me to give. Ipropose, therefore, to speak of the impression which the visit as a whole has leftr of the present position of the war.   Of that I am sure you are anxious, above allelse, to hear.&quot; 4. Let me say, however, in advance just one word about the people of britain and our own fighting forces overseas. After two years of war the menand women of that beleaguered Isle are, I believe, more resolute, more determined,more courageous than ever. But they have, I believe, a greater burden than ever to bear. It has been well and truly said that the worst part of martyrdom is notthe last agonizing moment; it is the wearing daily steadfastness. That is whatone realizes in Britain as it can only be realized in a country which daily facesthe threat of actual invasion and has already suffered actual destruction of itscities, its national monuments, and its homes. The scene of devastation inbombed-out areas such as the one surrounding St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral and covering a vast part of the City of London is truly appalling. That destruction isparalleled in many parts of the United Kingdom. Those scenes must be everpresent in the minds of the men and women of Britain. They relate to the past,but they are even more terrifying in what they disclose of a possible future. Itis this burden which, in addition to all others, the people of Britain are calledupon continually to bear. A respite from bombing such as has been experienced in greater or less degree since the beginning of the Russian campaign may cause the visitor to Britain to feel that many of the nation&apos;s activities are proceeding as usual, as indeed they are, to an extent which is nothing short of marvellous,but the martyrdom of daily anxiety and prolonged weariness is ever present.&apos; &quot;&apos;5.&apos; It is in this light that Canada&apos;s contribution to the cause is best;understood,  The most casual visitor to Britain, to almost any part of the Island,could hot fail to realize thai, the Canadians are numbered among her defendersnor how grateful the people of Britain are for their presence.   Make no mistakeabout it, the British people know our men are at their side; there are, as youall know,, in Britain to-day well over 100,000 of Canada&apos;s fighting men.    the significance the British people arid the British Government attach to GariadaVmilitary contribution to the defence of Britain on land, at sea and in the airI can,,perhaps, best leave to the Prime Minister,of,the United Kingdom to say.:Every Canadian heart must, have been .thrilled by Mr.&apos;ChurehnTs words when;he^sMd^&apos;Jtliajt,pu^&apos;Panadian soldiers, stood Vt  he very point where they would be,thei first, toffee&apos; kurled ,ih&apos;to a counter-stroke against the invader. . I can assure youthJitlt wasino;;flig]it- of rhetoric but;a measured statement, when. Mr. Churchill
further said that no greater service could be rendered to Britain and no moreimportant military duty performed by any troops in all the Allies, and when,after referring to what had taken place in other theatres of war, he added thatthe part they have played in bringing about the final result was second to none.&quot; 6. But the fighting men of Canada are not only sharing in the defence.of britain, they are also helping to carry the war into the enemy&apos;s territory. Ourpilots and airmen are: daily engaged in actual operations. In the growing numbersof.,Canadian pilots, observers and air gunners serving with the Royal Air Forceand in the squadrons of the Royal Canadian Air Force in Britain we arealready witnessing the telling effect of the British Commonwealth Air Trainingplan, which daily looms larger in the strategy of the war.&quot; 7.. The nature of the work of Canada&apos;s Navy in British waters and on theNorth Atlantic does not lend itself to display, but I found in informed circles afull knowledge and very warm appreciation of the importance of Canada&apos;s naval co-operation with Britain.&quot; 8. From all sides I heard nothing but praise of the machines and weapons of war which Canada is sending across the sea in ever growing volume. Canadianindustry and Canadian labour may well be proud of their part in forging thetools of victory. In a struggle in which machines are essential we can afford to spare no effort to maintain the momentum of our war production. Speakingwhat I knew was in the minds and hearts of our farmers and others of our growersand producers, I was, indeed, proud to be able to assure the Government and thepeople of Britain that Canada would send them all the food that ships could befound to carry.&quot;9. I shall leave it to Mr. Churchill himself to express what Britain feelsconcerning Canada&apos;s war effort. I have already quoted some of his words spokenat the Mansion House less than a fortnight ago. Let me conclude this portionof my remarks with further words spoken on the same occasion by the PrimeMinister of Britain. It is the message I bring back from the Government and people of Britain to my colleagues in the Cabinet and to the people of Canada.Here are Mr. Churchill&apos;s words.&quot; 10. The war effort of Canada during this war happily has not so farrequired effusion of blood upon a large scale, but that effort in men, in ships,aircraft, air training, in finance, in food, constitutes an element in the resistance of the British Empire without which that resistance could not be successfullymaintained.&quot; 11. Of Mr. Churchill himself and of his colleagues I should like to say a word. Having sat with them in Council I would say that I marvel at the fidelity,ability and resiliency with which they carry the burden of their greatresponsibilities. They are surrounded by the best of professional expert opinion and advice. Their discussions are supplemented by the freest interchange ofview and opinion with the Governments of the several Dominions. I feel thatfor purposes of Commonwealth consultation at a time of war it would be difficultif not impossible to improve upon what in effect is a continuing conference ofCabinets established under the system of immediate and constant communicationas it had come into being prior to the beginning of the war and has since been developed. Of Mr. Churchill, I should like to repeat what I said in London inhis presence and in the presence of his fellow-countrymen, that of. him historyI believe will record that by his example and his leadership he had helped to save not his country only but the freedom of the world.&quot; 12. I was deeply impressed by the new bonds which have been established between the King and Queen and the people. The immediate way in which theirMajesties have shared the dangers, the sorrows and the sufferings. of, the peoplehas greatly deepened the hold the King and Queen have always had on their loyalty and affections. May I pause here to repeat the heartfelt greetings, whichI was asked by King George and Queen Elizabeth to give to the people of Canada.&quot;.Her, Majesty Q^ueenMary also wished me&apos; to convey her i^memliijahces and good-!.wishes to the Canadian people. .   . -[&apos;&apos;&apos; 13. &quot;Were I to seek ^express in a, single Sentence what,&apos;above [ail;&apos;else&apos; has ^impressed itself mOst deeply up6n,my;riiind as. the;result&apos; biFin^v&apos;jsii&apos;;% BiHtaiil jI w&apos;quld[say&quot; it, was [the confirmation; beyond. the shadow of&apos; a:&apos;dQub;t\of;i]he view !I have1 held&apos; from&apos;the outset of&apos;theVwar&apos; Sf&apos; tje&apos;&quot; real; [iSsue : iff &apos;me . sj^^gle1 6f [the&apos;;;nature of. the forces jn conflict and of the pTObablis scale p&apos;f.&apos;;&apos;0^conrlrct JiWelf;!&apos;Thax view expressed ih the following&apos; words i&apos;ri a hroadcaSt&apos; d;elive&apos;re&apos;d; on&apos;&quot;the1 da\P&apos;Britain entered the war.[22932] b 2
&quot; 14. The forces of evil have been loosed in the world in a struggle betweenthe pagan conception of a social order which ignores the individual and is basedupon the doctrine of might and a civilisation based upon the Christian conception of the Brotherhood of man with its regard for the sanctity of contractual relations and the sacredness of human personality.&quot; 15. We have now entered upon the third year of war. It has taken twoyears of conflict to convince the world, if, indeed, all peoples are even yet con-vinced, of the truth of that statement. The wonder, however, is not that it should,have taken two years to bring the truth home to mankind, the marvel rather isthat in the space of two years Nazi Germany should have been able so clearly to demonstrate its accuracy.&quot; 16. How, it may be asked, was it possible to discern at the outbreak ofwar that the issue was what it is, that the forces were what they are, and thatthe conflict, ere its close, would be on a world scale? The answer to those questions is to be found in the philosophy of modern Germany, in the ambitionsof Germany revealed time after time since the days of Bismarck, and in Nazideception, terror and violence. To any one who had studied the history ofGermany for the last hundred years it should not have been difficult to realise that the forces being loosed upon the world and the methods to be employed inthe wider struggle would be those with which the Nazis had gained control ofGermany itself. The issue to be fought out on a world scale was the issue betweenthe Nazis and their defeated opponents in Germany. Unless the Nazi power was destroyed it was clear that it would seek to expand its sway without limits of space or time.&quot; 17. When war came the light of a Christian civilisation had alreadybeen extinguished in Nazi Germany. Human freedom, and with it humanbrotherhood, had already been crushed. Every interest had been made subordi-nate to the creation of the most powerful military machine ever known. Menwho resisted were ruthlessly imprisoned or murdered. Deception, terror and violence had become the practised arts of statecraft.&quot; 18. Since September two years ago these same forces have been loosedfirst beyond the boundaries and across the territories of the countries borderingon Germany and then, as her conquests mounted, farther and farther afield.To-dajr no country is too remote to be menaced by the deception of Nazi agents,by the terror of the Gestapo or by the violence of German-armed aggression.The Nazi sway knows no limits but the limits of Nazi rapacity and Nazi power.&quot; 19. Two years ago ambition so unlimited and aims so vast appeared tomost men utterly fantastic. The scope and magnitude of so great a danger wereto many at the time beyond comprehension. It is not surprising that national security at that time was still conceived of in terms of neutrality, and that indi-vidual countries should still have thought of their position in terms of powerfulisolation. If there is one thing that the last two years have made plain it issurely that, as a means of escape from the encircling danger which now threatensthe entire world, no nation which wishes to see freedom survive can now look to anything so old-fashioned as its own sovereign rights or so restricted as its ownunaided strength. Remoteness from the immediate scene of conflict has ceased to be a safeguard for men and nations that cherish their freedom. Surely, wehave now come to see that even in seeking the preservation of our own freedomall who cherish freedom are members one of another without regard to class orrace or nationality. If human freedom is to survive all free men, regardless ofnational frontiers, must work together for its preservation.&quot; 20. Some years ago I made a special study of the problems of industryand of the principles on which industrial reconstruction should be based if afteryears of war industrial strife were not to follow international strife. At thattime, more than twenty-two years ago, I reached the conclusion that there couldbe no permanent peace in industry unless the claims of humanity in industrial relations were recognised as superior to those of industry. In other words, it seemed to me that industry must recognise that it existed to serve the needs of humanity, not that humanity existed to serve the greed of industry. -1 felt at thetime, though I did not do more than express it in passing, that what was true of industry was equally true of nationality, that, unless the claims&apos;of humanitywere recognized as superior to those of any one nation or group of nations, weshould never have enduring international peace. I should like to emphasize thattruth to-day.   As I viewed the present conflict after two years of war from the
ovantage ground of Britain, one reflection impressed itself more than all elseupon my mind. It was the impression of the evil of national power when it exaltsitself above humanity.&quot;21. Britain still stands. But look at what stretches before her a Europe&apos;which all but completely, from the Atlantic to the Steppes of Russia, lies prostrateat the feet of Germany.&quot;22. People everywhere have been asking the question why did Hitlerattack Russia.. The answer, it seems to me, is a very simple one. It is the answerwhich to-day would be given to the same question asked regarding Poland orNorway or Holland or Belgium and all the other countries of Europe that hehas already conquered or invaded. Hitler attacked in order that he might gain in strategic position, in resources and in power. He sought also to remove thelast potential menace of land attack upon his forces of tyranny before the Nazisbecame locked in mortal conflict with what remained of the forces of freedom, atthe spearhead of which the peoples of Britain continue to stand.&quot; 23. The President of the United States, in the latest of his greatpronouncements, did not hesitate to say &apos; It must be explained again and again to people who like to think of the United States Navy as an invincible protectionthat this can be true only if the British Navy survives. That if the world outsidethe Americas falls under Axis domination, the shipbuilding facilities which the axis Powers would then possess in all of Europe, in the British Isles and inthe Far East, would be much greater than all the shipbuilding facilities andpotentialities of all the Americas, not only greater but two or three times greater.&apos;&quot;24. Do I need to say more; it must surely be apparent that, if freedomis to be preserved anywhere in this world, we have now come to a time and place where forces of vaster scope and proportions than those of any single nationor Empire, however powerful, must unite in opposing those forces which to-dayseek world conquest and world domination. Union merely in purpose and aimwill not be sufficient. The World&apos;s Free Forces must act increasingly as one inevery aspect of the common cause if humanity is to be saved a prolonged andbitter agony. Nothing less than one vast brotherhood of freedom will suffice to-day to preserve the world&apos;s freedom.&apos;&apos; 25. I said in London that nothing in recent months had been mor significant than the recognition of the deepening interdependence of the BritishCommonwealth and the United States. That deepening interdependence is thebrightest light T see upon the world&apos;s horizon at the beginning of this third year of war. Let me emphasize here its true significance. That deepening inter-dependence has not developed because Britain or the British Commonwealth ofNations are weaker to-day than they have been hitherto. They are, I believe, infact I know, far stronger than they have ever been. It is not that the defencesof the United States are weaker. They are, in fact, far stronger than they everwere. The growing sense of interdependence has arisen because, while albeit atthe sacrifice of assistance to other nations the British Commonwealth and theUnited States might each for itself be able to resist invasion and conquest, eachis coming to realize that neither acting alone could destroy a military machinesuch as Germany already possesses and is in a position further to strengthen.Without the common action of both, the present war might well drag on for years, and the world be reduced to a condition of chaos which will make decisivevictory, not to mention reconstruction, impossible.&quot;26. What we have all still to learn is that while the Nazi leaders aremasters of the arts of deception, of intrigue, of brutality and of terror, beneaththe Nazi Regime is the Prussian military machine. Compared in power withNaziism, Prussian militarism is as the ocean itself to the foam engendered upon its surface in a storm. It is the most powerful engine of destruction the worldhas known. Behind Germany&apos;s numbers, behind the extent of her conquests,behind the new resources of which for the time being at least the Germans have become the masters, lies the Prussian mind. It is the real force behind the Naziterror. It is the real secret of German power. It remains the implacable foe. TheGerman war machine, the inhuman monster which the Prussian mind has created and continues to direct has already ravaged a, whole continent andimpoverished, enslaved, strangled or devoured millions of human lives. It is adragon which can only be slain by fighting men.&quot;27. From now on, let free men everywhere face reality. Let themrecognize that it is something infinitely greater than the fate of any country
which they are called upon to defend, that it is the defence of freedom, not of any country, not of any continent, nor, indeed, of any hemisphere, but that it is thefreedom of mankind which is at issue.  For we are all members one&apos;of another.&quot; 28. In notes on his play &apos; Abe Lincoln in Illinois &apos; Robert E. Sherwoodhas a most illuminating passage on the man whose life he:has sought to.portray.He tells us that Lincoln, from a man of doubt and indecision, even ofindifference, became astonishingly transformed into a man of passionate convic-tion and decisive action. Lincoln, he states, was always opposed in theory toslavery, but was even more opposed to the stirring up of trouble. He knew that in the slave question were stores of high explosive which, if ignited,could destroy the Union. In so far as he was concerned, North and Southcould have gone on living together harmoniously half slave and half freehad that been possible. But in those stirred and troubled years, says Sherwood,the United States was refusing to remain as it had been divided, into North andSouth. The wheels of the covered wagons were beginning to cut long furrowsacross the plains beyond the Mississippi river. Lincoln had frequent contact with the drivers of those covered wagons. To his progressive spirit it became a personal matter when he heard increasingly-hot arguments as to whether all thatvast new territory of the west should be slave or free. It was the question of theextension of slavery, says Sherwood, which converted Lincoln into the leader ofa military cause. If he was willing to let the South mind its own business, hewas not willing to stand by in silence when it threatened to establish domination of the west.&quot; 29. In one of the acts of Sherwood&apos;s play a little boy is lying sick in acovered wagon. His people are travelling far to seek a new home to make the earth a good place for their children to live in. They are not afraid of the perilsthat lie along the way.&quot; 30. Lincoln humbly prays to God that their child be not taken from hisparents; &apos; Grant him,&apos; Lincoln prays, &apos; the freedom of life; do not condemn himto the imprisonment of death. Do not deny him his birthright. Let him know the sight of great plains and high mountains, of green valleys and wide rivers.For this little boy is an American and these things belong to him and he to them.. Spare him that he, too, may strive for the ideal for which his fathers have labouredso faithfully and for so long.&apos;&quot; 31. The prayer which Lincoln gave for this sick boy was in effect, saysSherwood, a prayer for the survival of the United States of America.&apos;&apos; 32. History is forever repeating itself. The parallel between the greatcrisis in the history of the United States and the issue which faces the world to-day is almost complete, the difference lies solely in the scale upon which the human drama is unfolding itself. In Lincoln&apos;s day it was the fate of a singlecountry which was threatened because of its people being half slave and half free.Could that great country, as its settlement developed and its numbers increased,continue to exist half slave and half free that was the question Lincoln askedhimself, and he saw that there was but one answer to the question. Either theUnited States would become, in the course of time, all free or slavery would every-where exist. The issue, he believed, had to be fought out, and fought out to &quot;afinish.&quot;33. The lesson Lincoln learned in his day has come to have world-wideapplication to-day. It is one thing for a people to determine for itself its ownform of government and its own way of life. That is a right recognised fully inthe Atlantic Charter. It is quite another for any nation to attempt to force itsform of government and its way of life upon other peoples. It is because NaziGermany has chosen to force her so-called order upon all peoples that for free menthere is no choice but to crush Hitler and his Nazi system, and to rid the worldforever of the Prussian militarism on which it is founded.&quot; 34. As I look at the world to-day, that is the picture as it presents itselfto- my inner:^visioni: Only instead of the scene of1 conflict between slavery and&apos;freedom^ being, confined to a single country it has already assumed the propor-tioiis oLa conflict between continents. It may rapidly &quot;become a war between&apos;hemispheres. The issue will have to be fought out. It will-have to be fought outtovarfinish.&apos; fii hrnkfysnoo HS-nip, . v,i; bate ij&amp;siati msuryyij hmori Hi&amp;teft&apos;&quot;&apos;&apos;** USM-l The. line which to-day separat es&apos; the-; remaini ng; free peoples of: theworld from -thosel already enslaved may not be-as elea rlv defined as was the line between; theitNorth land ;South- in -the^ America?Pf^Lincbbi-s- dayV;i\ But it is aline even-more sharply defined: by brutality and; bafbaritv; r; In the world to-dav.
as in the Union of Lincoln/s day, it is the west, that; must decide the issue.Already the barbaric, hordes infest virtually the. whole of Europe. Only Britainremains free. Behind the lands already conquered they are fighting desperatelyfor even vaster domains. They must not be allowed to complete their conquestsin the old world. For let there be no mistake. It is no more possible for an Eastern hemisphere enslaved to rest in harmony with a western hemisphere thatis free than for darkness and light to dAvell together. Either the free forces ofthe world must destroy the forces of tyranny which in two years have plungedEurope into medieval darkness or themselves come to be held in thrall by the evil powers which to-day seek the world&apos;s domination.&quot;36. Mankind cannot long continue half slave and half free; a worldhalf slave and half free is the position that confronts the nations to-day as weenter upon a third year of war. If their peoples are to keep their personal and national freedom, nations that are still free must fight not in self-defence only,but equally to rescue from the jaws and the claws of the Frankenstein Monsterthat Germany has brought into being, the peoples of other lands, yes and ofGermany herself, whom otherwise it is destined also to devour and destroy.37. Again I repeat humanity must no longer be made to serve nationalends alone, whether those ends be mere isolated self-defence or world domination.Nations everywhere must.be made to serve and to save humanity. That is thesupreme lesson for all peoples as we now enter upon a third year of war.&quot; 38. We are concluding to-night a week devoted to the reconsecration ofthe people of Canada to the great task which they undertook two years ago. Thattask, as I have said, is our part in the. saving of humanity from a descent intouniversal chaos. In order speedily to accomplish that task, the total effort ofall free men is needed. We in Canada can make no more effective appeal to free men throughout the world than the appeal of our own example as a peoplestill removed from the heart of the struggle, yet putting forth our utmost effort.&quot; 39. I have already said that this war in its essence is not so much a war between nations as the clash of two &quot;opposing forces in the world. These twoforces are present in greater or less degree in every nation and in every people.They are competing for possession of the soul of man. They are nothing lessthan the forces of good and evil. The triumph of the cause of evil, which the nazis have made their own, would usher in a world governed by men who believemight is right and who would use force without a limit or scruple to gain theirends. It would be a world of masters and slaves, a world of masters corruptedby the evil of perverted power and of slaves condemned to the depths of humandegradation.&quot;40. But if the forces of evil are routed, if Nazi Germany and all herwicked works are destroyed, this war will assume in human history the shape ofa social revolution out of which mankind may hope for a new order to emerge,an order in which the power of right, not might, will increasingly control andfrom which the injustices of the old order, one by one, will be banished. In this new Order the rights of man will be determined not by privilege derived frominheritance, position or possessions, but increasingly by men&apos;s own contribution,through their own lives, to the common need and the common good.&quot; 41.   Just one word in conclusion.  You will gather from what I have saidthat I believe that two years of war have served not to lessen but to increase ithe.magnitude of the conflict.   For three months a bloody and spectacular strugglehas been waged in Eastern Europe.   In that struggle the resistance of Russianarms has been magnificent.   The effort of Russia has, however, not been withoutits subtle dangers to our cause.  In many hearts has been born the deceptive hopethat Russia might win the war for us.   There could be no more perilous illusion.Russia is fighting to save herself, as Poland, as Holland, as Belgium, as France,as Yugoslavia, and as Greece fought to save themselves.   Whatever the ou/tcomein Russia may be,.it.should be realised that the power, the skill and the,resources &apos;of the enemy are,so great that ;ithe slightest relaxation of effort in any-direction ^would be fraught ,with; the greatest of risks fox all,  Let us never forget the size &apos;and the power of Germany&apos;s. war machine,, and that while German forces-fight on idistant fronts Germany herself, and the countries controlled by Germany, &apos;continue to manuf acture the equipment:and ;munitions needed to effect the neccs-sary repairs and to keep her, armed forces, at&apos; the highest state of efficiency, i&apos;1&quot;&apos; &apos;ii n &apos;&apos;&quot; 42. I liave said nothing of other.theatres of.war and of other dangers :from which the Russian campaign, with: its &apos; emendous and dramatic clash of&apos;&apos;
great masses of men, has tended for the moment to divert our attention, I have said nothing of Africa or of the Orient, nothing of the Mediterranean, the atlantic or the Pacific. This war will not end until all the world is reduced toa condition of servitude or until the nations that are still free triumph over NaziGermany. We know that the free peoples will triumph in the end. But how long it may take to determine the issue, God alone knows.&quot; 43. How much, when it is over, may be left of what is worth while in theworld no one can say. That is why I believe it is vital to make a supreme effort nowto convince the people of Germany that they never can hope to win. Such a supreme effort can be made only if every nation and every man who is still freeput forth their utmost effort. &apos; The length of the ordeal through which humanitymust pass,&apos; to use words employed by President Roosevelt a night or two ago,the extent of the wastage of human life, the chance for reconstruction eremankind encounters something in the nature of world chaos all alike wait uponwhat it is possible for men who are still free to do here and now.&quot; 44. So I would say to every one in our own and in other lands whohas not yet found his true place in the war effort of his country &quot; Rise for the day is passing..and you lie dreaming on :The others have buckled their armour,and forth to the fight have gone.A place in the ranks awaits you,each man has some part to play:The past and the future are nothing,in the face of the stern to-day.Your arm will never be stronger,-or the need so great as to-day.&quot;(3)Telegram from Prime Minister to Mr. Mackenzie King, dated September 20, 1941.Deeply grateful for your splendid speech, which I have circulated to theCabinet.All good wishes.-W. S. C.
