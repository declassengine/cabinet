naval SITUATION.1.   H.M.S. Ark Royal has been torpedoed and sunk to the eastward of gibraltar, in which position a German U-boat was destroyed three days later.Enemy minelaying by aircraft has increased in the Thames Estuary.There has been a renewal of E-boat activity off the East Coast.Shipping losses have been light.Home Waters.2. On the evening of the 15th, in the Straits of Dover, a short engagementtook place between four of our Motor Gun Boats and enemy surface craftconsisting of six or seven E- or R-boats and at least one coaster or trawler, duringwhich casualties and damage were inflicted by both sides. Enemy shore batterieswere also in action. One M.G.B. was seriously damaged, one rating being killed and one officer and three ratings wounded.On the 17th s.s. Runmore (969 tons) shot down a Dornier 17 off Yarmouth.On the 19th H.M. Destroyer Garth was damaged by striking a wreck off the norfolk coast and H.M. Destroyer Castleton was holed as the result of an explosion, one rating being killed.During the night of the 19th E-boats attacked a convoy off Cromer and theescorts engaged them, assisted by Motor Gun Boats who were on patrol.H.M.S. Destroyer Wolsey claims to have sunk one E-boat, H.M.S. Campbell andM.G.B. 87 another, and M.G.Bs. on patrol a third. The following morning-Spitfires report sinking a fourth E-boat off the Dutch coast and damaging another.The total enemy losses are estimated to be two E-boats sunk, two probably sunk and others damaged.It is estimated that 9,000 tons of enemy shipping has been sunk or damaged by our aircraft.  Details are given in the Air Situation.Northern Waters.3. Between the 2nd and 10th November a Russian submarine sank awestbound ship of 5,000 tons and two escorted eastbound ships, about 100 miles south-west of North Cape. Another Russian submarine torpedoed a southboundtanker in Varanger Fiord on the 15th which was later seen on fire.H.M. Submarine Sealion sank by gunfire on the 18th a small Norwegiantanker, 330 tons, carrying fuel oil to Kirkenes when in the vicinity of the NorthCape.   The crew abandoned ship.Mediterranean.4. During the afternoon&apos;of the 13th H.M. Aircraft Carrier Ark Royal,when returning from operations in the Central Mediterranean, was torpedoed bya U-boat about 37 miles to the eastward of Gibraltar, and subsequently sankafter being taken in tow. The whole of the ship&apos;s company, with the exceptionof one rating killed, were rescued. Fourteen aircraft from Ark Royal landed at gibraltar.EM. Submarine Proteus, on return from patrol in the ^aegean, reported thatshe torpedoed the Italian tanker Tampico (4,958 tons) off Mandili Island on the morning of the 3rd. The tanker was still afloat at dusk, but a second attack was frustrated by the escort. On the 10th she torpedoed a ship similar to theGerman s.s. Ithaka (1,773 tons), heavily laden and southbound in the Gulf ofAthens, and possibly obtained a hit on her escort.It is estimated that 10,000 tons of enemy shipping has been sunk or damaged in Mediterranean by our aircraft; details are given in the Air Situation.During the week six French Merchant Ships (about 20,000 tons) westboundand one (2,000 tons), a survey vessel and 2 trawlers eastbound, have passed theStraits of Gibraltar under escort.Anti-Submarine Operations.5. On the 16th H.M. Corvette Marigold, 35 miles to the eastward of gibraltar, sank a German U-boat and took thirty-four prisoners. One of our aircraft made a promising attack 150 miles south-west of Ushant. Three other attacks have been carried out, two to the south of Iceland (C) and the other inthe Western approaches, without visible results.
Enemy Intelligence.6. The Battleship Tirpitz was last reported in the Baltic on the9th November.There is some evidence of a concentration of destroyers in the Baltic, and none are now lying at Brest. Some, however, have been reported on theNorwegian Coast.U-Boats.Between twenty and thirty U-boats have been operating during the week.The main concentration has been reported well out in the North Atlantic. Norecent information has been received of U-boats south of 30o North. In the early part of the week three or four were operating to the east of Gibraltar.The number of German submarines in the Mediterranean has increased andmay now be as high as ten. It is believed that they are based at Salonika andPiraeus.Enemy Attack on Trade.7. A Norwegian ship, homeward bound from Chittagong, was sunk after an explosion, off East London (S. Africa). No casualties from U-boats have beenreported during the week under review. Enemy aircraft have again been activeon the East Coast, sinking two ships and damaging another. A trawler was bombed and sunk off the Faroe Islands. One small ship was mined and sunk inFalmouth harbour. Three ships in a south-bound convoy off Cromer were sunk by E-boats during the night of 19th/20th.Reports have been received that a ship was sunk by a U-boat about 900 miles west of Walfish Bay on the 28th October and another 400 miles south of Freetownon the 12th November.Protection of Seaborne Trade.8. During the week ending the 19th November 849 ships, including180 allied and 25 neutral, were convoyed. Four cruisers, five anti-aircraft ships,one hundred destroyers - (including thirty-one United States destroyers), andninety-four sloops and corvettes were employed on escort duties.Imports into United Kingdom by ships in convoy during the week ending the 15th November totalled 606,354 tons, compared with 1,295,823 tons duringthe preceding week, and an average of 990,557 tons during the past 10 weeks. Ofthis figure 247,867 tons were oil imports and 358,487 tons were non-tankerimports.British Minelaying.9. Mines have been laid off. the French Channel Coast and in northern waters.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.10. Mines were laid in the Thames Estuary, off Harwich, and in the bristol channel. The Thames Estuary was the most heavily raided, as many as 35 air-craft operating on one night.Sixteen magnetic and nine acoustic mines have-been destroyed during theweek. The mine totals are : 1,517 magnetic, 1,161 acoustic and 1,063 moored mines.Enemy Merchant Shipping.11. The Swedish s.s. Vollrath Tham, 5,787 tons, was lost owing to war risksoff the entrance to the River Ems on the 10th November while carrying ore toGermany, and the German s.s. Schwaneck, 2,194 tons, was mined off Stettin.There is evidence that the Corinth Canal is now open to ships of the largesttonnage which previously used it.[23172] B
The German s.s. Odenwald, 5,098 tons, was taken by the United States ships which intercepted her into San Juan, Puerto Rico. A Prize Court has decidedthat, as the German Captain signalled asking for boats to be sent as the Odenwaldwas sinking the ship was therefore salvage, and as such has been awarded to theUnited States.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Finland.12.   There has been no appreciable change.Leningrad sector.13. The situation around the city remains unchanged. Apart from the consolidation of the area between the spearheads at Schluesselberg and Tikvinthere have been no offensive operations by the Germans.Kalinin area.14. Fighting in this area continues to be severe. Although the spearheadthrust to Kalinin has been widened slightly on its northern edge, German forces have not been able to make any progress eastwards and have suffered heavily inmen and material from the vigorous Russian opposition, both on the ground and from the air. Heavy fighting is also taking place in the area betweenKalinin and Wolokolamsk. The German forces still appear to be seriouslyhampered by supply difficulties and weather conditions.Central sector.15. Due west of Moscow and south as far as Tula, over a front of roughly150 miles, the Germans have not succeeded in making any advance. In theTula-Orel sector, however, after failure to make progress northwards from Tula,the German forces have begun a thrust eastwards with some success. their object may be either to cut the Moscow-Ryazan-Voronezh railway or to swingnorthwards against Moscow from the line Tula-Riazhsk.16. In general, the frost-has somewhat improved road conditions in thewhole of the central sector, but the supply situation continues to be serious andthe German troops are suffering severely from cold, as only some units are fully equipped with winter clothing.Donetz sector.17. No appreciable progress has been made in the German advance. Therehas been no fighting on a major scale, although operations continue.Rostov sector.18. The position immediately west of the town remains unchanged and theroad conditions have continued to hamper further German advance.Crimea.19. While the Germans are still meeting with strong resistance and bad weather conditions in their advance on Sevastopol, they have succeeded inoccupying practically the whole of the Eastern Crimea and have entered the town of Kerch.
Operations.Libya and Egypt.20. At dawn on the 18th November the Army in the Western Desert, underthe command of General Sir Alan Cunningham, began its advance intoCyrenaica.21. $Slrf&quot; armoured force crossed the frontier South of Sidi Omar, andby the evening had penetrated some 50 miles into enemy territory. At the sametime, pressure was exerted against the Axis defences in the Sollum-Sidi Omar-Bardia triangle. The preliminary concentrations and moves were carried out without interference from the enemy.22. Strict wireless silence has been maintained and no further informationof the progress of the operations is at present available.A abyssinia.23. North of Gondar active patrolling has been carried out by our troopsopposite the enemy&apos;s position in the Ambazzo area. The column advancing onGondar, from the south-east has located enemy positions in the area of Cucualbert(Kulkaber) (29 miles S.E. of Gondar) and Peroaber (7 miles S.W. of Cucualbert).Leading troops of the column advancing from the south-west have made contact with the enemy 8 miles west of Celga. South of Gondar the enemy forces atGianda (14 miles S.E. of Celga) surrendered on the 11th November to an EthiopianBn., after an engagement lasting four hours. Air bombing and machine-gunningof the enemy&apos;s positions in all sectors have been intensified and good results havebeen obtained. Patriot forces are co-operating with our forward troops and are continually harassing the enemy, with the result that many deserters are coming in.24. A band of Wogera tribesmen, estimated 6,000 strong, raided a village12 miles south-east of Batie (30 miles East of Dessie) causing casualties andstealing cattle.  They are reported to have moved northwards.25.   In the French Somaliland frontier Vichy post is reported to havefired on one of our patrols on the 6th November.Hong Kong.26. Two Canadian Infantry Battalions, the Winnipeg Grenadiers and theRoyal Rifles (Canada), with ancillary troops, arrived on the 16th November.Intelligence.France.27. A review of evidence from Occupied France indicates that recent troop movements eastwards have resulted in a reduction in the total of German divisionsthere from 27 to 24. Of those which left, two are believed to have gone frombetween the River Gironde and the Spanish frontier, leaving only two divisions in that area. It is probable that many of the divisions remaining in France are considerably below strength owing to the frequent transfer of drafts of trained men, and in some eases of complete units, to the Russian front.Italy.28. 1st Division from Turin has been identified at Aversa and Battipaglia,in the Naples area. While this move may be connected with possible Italianapprehensions of civil disturbance as a result of our heavy bombing of Naples,the main motive is more probably nervousness about the defence of southern Italy.Though no other fresh formations have been identified in this area, it is believedthat the depots of southern Italian divisions at present overseas are considerablyover strength, and, there is evidence that heavy artillery from the northernfrontiers is being transferred to the south for coast defence. Batteries have been identified at the mouth of the Sele River south of Naples, and in Sicily.Libya.29.   Although there are still no indications of elements of any fresh Germanformation arriving in Libya, the transport of drafts to North Africa continues.[23172] &apos; B 2
The strength of the German forces is still estimated to be two armoured divisions and two infantry regiments of another division which is not armoured.Far East.30. Japanese military preparations during the past week have been cheifly French Indo-China. When these preparations began about the middle ofOctober, it appeared that they were directed against Kunming on,the burma road, and that the Japanese intended to form a large concentration in Tongking(North Indo-China). Approximately 50,000 troops were landed at Haiphong,but the bulk of these have now left for Southern Indo-China. It is apparent that the main concentration is in the south directed against Thailand. Inaddition to these movements, there are also indications that the Japanese mayintend reducing their northern concentration against Russia and move some ofthese troops south..31. The estimated distribution of Japanese forces in the south is now asfollows : Formosa : 2 Divisions.Hainan : 1 Division.Canton : 3 Divisions.Swatow: 1 Ind. Mxd. Bde.French Indo-China-North: 1 Division.South : 3 Divisions.1 Tank Regiment.Total: 10 Divisions.1 Ind. Mxd. Bde.1 Tank Regiment.AIR SITUATION.General Review.32. Bad weather at Home and on the Continent caused a marked decline inour activity and also that of the enemy.In Libya persistent day and night attacks have been made on enemy aerodromes and supplies; armoured fighting vehicles and motor transport havebeen attacked.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.33. No operations were carried out by aircraft of Bomber Command.Offensive sorties by fighters were restricted to 259 compared with 633 last week.Attacks on shipping are reported under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;On the 15th and 17th, a series of operations by Spitfires, Whirlwindsand Hurricane bombers were directed against oil refineries and alcohol distilleriesin North-West France and the Cherbourg Peninsula. Buildings and oil con-tainers at Dieppe, Bricquebec, Cerences, La Meauffe, Bourbourg and St. Lo were successfully attacked and, in addition, our aircraft destroyed a railway locomotiveand registered hits on a train, on several gun-posts and on a number of german troops.  In these operations we lost five Spitfires.34.   On the 18th, similar operations in the Le Touquet area were hampered   Iby thick cloud, but, without loss to themselves, our fighters destroyed in combatone enemy fighter, probably destroyed five more and damaged a further four.Night.35. Owing to the weather, all Bomber Command operations were cancelledon five nights. On the 15th/16th, 110 aircraft were despatched, principallyagainst Emden and Kiel. On the 18th/19th, six Stirlings operated against Brest.Totals of 93 tons of H.E. bombs and 2,490 incendiaries were dropped.
36. Aircraft despatched to Emden and Kiel met with severe icingconditions and found their targets obscured by heavy cloud. At the former port24 tons of H.E. bombs, including five of 4,000 lbs., were dropped, but, apart froma large fire, no results could be seen. At the latter, where 11 tons of H.E. bombs were released, visibility was equally bad and only bursts were observed.37.   Heavy cloud also prevented the observation of results at Brest, where10 tons of bombs were dropped.United Kingdom.38. Fighter Command flew 883 sorties by day and 186 sorties by night; thesetotals are substantially lower than those of the previous week and reflect the unfavourable weather conditions prevailing.39.   The scale of enemy effort was the lowest recorded since the beginningof operations on the Russian front and there were few features of interest.40. No concentrated attacks were made on land targets. In daylight moreaircraft crossed the coast than for many weeks, advantage being taken of lowcloud to make brief sorties in coastal areas. At night few aircraft penetratedinland.Coastal Operations.41. Coastal Command flew 181 patrols (267 sorties) and provided 19 convoy escorts (50 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Commandtotalled 324 (728 sorties).42. Owing to the unfavourable weather, attacks on enemy shipping were considerably reduced. A Hudson bombed an 8,000-ton merchant -vessel off ListerLight; two hits amidships were seen and the ship was left listing. Spitfiressank a 500-ton vessel off Fecamp, and numerous hits with machine gun and cannonfire were made by Beaufighters of Coastal Command on a 600-ton vessel offIjmuiden. Other ships were bombed and machine-gunned off the Norwegian coastwithout the effects being observed.43. Eleven aircraft were despatched to lay sea-mines off Lorient, St. Nazaireand the Frisian Islands.44. Enemy offensive activity was still directed mainly against shipping.Six attacks were made by day off the Humber, Cromer, the Needles and the faroes, and six at dusk or in the early hours of darkness off Waterford, Dundee,and the East Coast. Minelaying is suspected in the Thames Estuary and in the bristol Channel area.45. Aircraft from the Condor unit were identified west of Ireland on two occasions but failed to locate the convoy for which they were apparently searching.In recent weeks this unit has operated west of Spain and Portugal and the movenorthwards represents a return to its former area of operations.46. Routine shipping and weather reconnaissances were carried out by theenemy over the North Sea (as far North as the Faroes and Jan Mayen Island),the Channel, and the Atlantic.Central Mediterranean..47. A night attack by 19 Wellingtons lasting five and a half hours wasmade on the railway centre of Catania; over 30 tons of bombs were dropped and many hits were observed in the target area. Nuisance raids were also carriedout at night by small forces of Wellingtons on enemy bases at Brindisi, Naples,Tripoli (L), Benghazi and Messina, and bombs were dropped on the railway centres and on other objectives; at Brindisi two factories were set on fire, andhits on the barracks and. on oil tanks resulted in a number of explosions and a.large fire.48. Six Blenheims attacked a small convoy West of Zante, making a direct hit on a merchant vessel of 4,000 tons.   Petrol stored on deck was ignited by
machine-gun fire, and the ship was left alight. Another convoy of three merchantvessels and a destroyer was attacked by five Blenheims in the Gulf of Sirte; one ship of 5,000 tons was hit and left with a list to starboard, a schooner was alsohit and was last seen low in the water, while a near miss was made on the othermerchant vessel of 2,000 tons. Three Blenheims are missing. Five Albacoresoperating under the A.O.C., Malta, laid mines in the sea off Marsala.49. Hurricane bombers carried out an offensive patrol over South-EastSicily; they bombed a train and a water tower at Noto Station, and also shot upa factory and signal boxes with cannon and machine-gun fire.50. On two nights the enemy carried out small offensive operations againstMalta without causing any damage of importance.Eastern Mediterranean.51. Our reconnaissance aircraft have been active over shipping routes between Crete and Libya, road communications in Western Cyrenaica, aerodromes in Crete and Libya, and enemy positions in the frontier area. Tactical andstrategical reconnaissances were flown on the 18th November, but results were limited by very unfavourable weather and sandstorms.52. Night offensive operations were undertaken by Wellingtons, which flewa total of 155 sorties. On the first three nights of the week railway sidings,stores dumps and the harbour at Benghazi were the principal objectives, andthree direct hits were made with 4,000-lb. bombs. Other attacks were made on aircraft stores at Berca, where a violent explosion was reported, on the storesdumps at Bardia, on the town of Derna and on the aerodromes at El Tmimi,El Gazala, Derna and Martuba. On the night of the 16th/17th November fiveBombays were despatched with parachute troops whose object was thedestruction, on the following night, of enemy aircraft on the ground at El Tmimiand El Gazala. To divert attention from the Bombays, Wellingtons carried out a heavy attack on these two landing grounds; bad weather prevailed and oneBombay and one Wellington are missing.53. In daylight on the first six days, mary lands made over 110 bombingsorties; the attacks, which averaged about eight aircraft, were concentratedagainst enemy aerodromes. Bombs were seen to fall among dispersed aircraft,a substantial number of which were known to be destroyed or damaged.A direct hit was made on the barracks at Berca, and two successful raids weremade on the stores dumps at El Gazala. During these offensive operations our casualties were light and on only two occasions were our aircraft intercepted by enemy fighters, as a result of which one Me. 110 was shot down and twoMarylands are missing. On the 19th November, 32 sorties by mary lands andBlenheims were carried out in the Gambut/Bardia/Capuzzio area against enemyA.F.Vs and M.T., with satisfactory results.54. Large numbers of enemy transport aircraft have recently been reportedflying between Crete and Cyrenaica. On the 18th and 19th November Beaufightersintercepted and shot down seven Ju. 52s and one H.S. 126, and on the groundthey destroyed four S. 79s, five Ju. 87s, two Me. 109 Fs and one Fieseler Storch.55. Our fighters have also provided some bomber escorts, and have patrolledover our forward areas and attacked ground targets in enemy territory-Hurricanes intercepted an enemy bomber escorted by eight G. 50s and shot downtwo of the escort; a Me. 110 was also destroyed over the frontier area. In anattack made by 24 Tomahawks on 15 Italian fighters at Sidi Rezegh landing ground (15 miles E.S.E. of El Adem) two of the enemy aircraft were destroyed and the remaining 13 damaged. Beaufighters destroyed 20 motor vehicles and four petrol tankers in the Binina area, and also damaged about 30 motor vehiclesnear Derna. Motor transport was twice effectively attacked by Blenheim fighterson the Jedabya-El Agheila road and many vehicles were extensively damaged.56. On 18th November, 17 bombers with fighter escort successfully attacked200 to 300 A.F.Vs. and M.T. which were bogged at Bir el Gobi. On the same day Hurricanes shot down three C.R. 42s over Jalo (220 miles S.S.E. of Benghazi),and destroyed two aircraft on the ground at Gasr es Sahabi (60 miles S.E. ofJedabya), where two other aircraft were also damaged by Blenheims.
57. Enemy activity has been on a small soale. The only concentrated attack was made on a Royal Air Force aerodrome at Giarabub, by a force of 36 bombers and fighters; one Blenheim was destroyed and five others damaged and petrolstores were set on fire; one Me. 110 and one Ju. 88 were shot down. On the19th November 3 Me. 109Fs. attacked one of our forward landing grounds and destroyed two Hurricanes on the ground and shot down a Tomahawk, the pilotof which is safe.Russia.German Air Force Operations against Russia.58. Operations by day on the Moscow front continue generally at a low level, but long-range bombers have operated consistently by night. So far as isknown, raids in the Moscow area have been on a small scale and of a harassingnature.59. There has been considerably greater activity in the Black Sea area inconnection with the Crimean operations, long-range bombers and torpedo-carrying aircraft being engaged in heavy attacks on Sebastopol and the Russianfleet and shipping in the harbour.Although the Germans claim to have occupied Kerch, the fact remains thatthey first reached the Perekop Isthmus two months ago when their first attackon the Russian defences failed. The delay thus caused is of some importance,not only for the time it has given the Russians to organise their air force inCaucasia, but also for the reason that a certain period must yet elapse before long-range bomber units can be established at the Crimea aerodromes, and theiroperational value will be restricted by the shortening hours of daylight and the approach of winter conditions.60. The withdrawal of a number of units to Central Germany has been inprogress recently, and up to date it is estimated that 400-500 long-range bombershave been moved back for reforming. Several weeks must elapse before these units can again become operational, and there is reason to suppose that part atleast will return to the &quot;Western Front.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.61. Bombing on land, which was light and scattered, has again been confined to Coastal Areas principally in the East and South-East together with the South-Western districts of England and Wales.62. By day incidents took place on the 12th, 14th, 15th and 16th November.A few bombs were dropped on each night of the week, except on the 16th/17thNovember.Damage.63. On the 15th November, Dorman Long and Company&apos;s Iron Works atRedcar were hit and the gas cleansing plant of the blast furnaces was put outof action, causing some loss of production of pig iron. Apart from this incident,the damage done was mainly confined to private property. Utility services and railway communications were only slightly affected.Casualties.64. Casualties for the week ending 0600 on the 19th November, 1941, are estimated at 21 killed and 28 seriously injured. Of these, 10 were killed and16 seriously injured at Redcar on the 15th November and 9 were killed at Sturry,near Canterbury, on the night of the 18th/19th November.
