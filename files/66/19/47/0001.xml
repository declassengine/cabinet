THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.SECRET. Copy N0&apos;  11W.P. (41) 274.November 19, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ASSISTANCE TO RUSSIA.BY direction of the Prime Minister, the following telegrams are circulatedto the War Cabinet.(Signed) E. E. BRIDGES,Secretary of the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.W. 1,November 19, 1941.Cypher Telegram from the War Office to the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East,and the Commander-in-Chief, India, dated November 14, 1941.(51682 (M.O. 1).)(Immediate.)Following from Chiefs of Staff, No. 200 :-Reference 0/21314, 1/11, from Commander-in-Chief, Middle East.1. Although Russians are still being sticky about telling us their intentions and dispositions, and have not reacted to our offer of Staff Conversations, we mustbe in a position to give them a firm offer of assistance the moment they show signsof being more forthcoming. We consider that our offer should be a corps of two divisions, 18th and 50th, one A/C squadron, six fighter and one bomber squadron,to be available for operations by the end of March. A part of this force might beavailable earlier.2.   Following are our reasons : (i) Defence of South Caucasia strategically of great value to Middle Eastposition and of great importance in effect on Turkish resistance to german demands.(ii) Russians are being very difficult about Staff Conversations regardingco-operation in Caucasia. Offering assistance for Southern russian front by at least two divisions with air forces, seems to be only hopeof gaining facilities for reconnaissance, and for preparations in north persia which are essential for security of our own interests. An offer of air forces and special units alone would be insufficient, in our viewrto induce Russians to permit reconnaissance,(iii) If South Russian front situation seriously deteriorates, presence ofBritish formations will do more to stiffen Russian morale andresistance than presence of small units and despatch of material.[23165]
(iv) In our judgment, the forces we send are unlikely to get further than theCaucasus Mountains, and therefore they need not include armoured forces, for which there is little scope in this terrain,(v) Political effect at home if Germans penetrate South of CaucasusMountains without any British opposition would be most serious.(vi) Proposed force might at least reach and help hold the Caucasusmountains and improve our chances of defending or, if necessary,destroying the oil which we believe is becoming vital to Germany,(vii) Although air forces in strength proposed will prevent us from imple-menting in full our offer of air forces to Turkey, denial of SouthCaucasia to Germany will safeguard Turkey&apos;s eastern front and prevent her encirclement.   If taken in rear, Turks may collapse.3. Time Factor. We estimate that even against strong Russian resistanceGermany may reach Baku three months after gaining bridgehead over the RiverDon in the South. Therefore we must commence move quickly if we are to bein time.4. We have not yet approached Russians, and request your combinedcomments on above urgently. Please co-ordinate reply with Commander-in-Chief.India.5.   Meanwhile, you should press forward with all possible preparations inIraq and British-occupied Persia, to enable you to move forces outlined above.6.   Paragraph 4 of our No. 196 stands.7. Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, please pass to Air OfficerCommanding-in-Chief, Middle East, as from Air Ministry.Cypher telegram from Commander-in-Chief, India, to the War Office, repeatedCommander-in-Chief, Middle East, dated November 18, 1941.(Immediate.)(18111.)Your 51682 (M.O. 1) 14/11 (C.O.S. 200).1. Firstly, you must realise movement and maintenance this force inCaucasus by April 1942 will strain transportation resources (? likely to) beavailable to utmost, and will mean that (? supplies to) Russia by this route willpractically cease. It is therefore choice between sending this force or sendingmaterial Russia requires. It will not be possible to do both with presentdevelopment. Also, our construction of defences in Iraq and Persia will be seriously hampered.2. Secondly, we entirely disagree with statement there is little scope forarmoured forces in this Terrain. Main weight enemy attack is likely to bedirected on Baku from north. (? In this) area between Caspian Sea and hillycountry there are on average 10 to 20 miles width country entirely (? suitable for)armoured forces (see J.I.C. (41) 419 27th October, Para. 14). Most of countrybetween Caucasus Range and North Persia and greater part of North Persiaitself is good tank country. We consider it would be most unwise commit forces to North Persia or Caucasus without adequate armoured components. North ofCaucasus is of course perfect tank county.3. Thirdly, we do not agree that despatch of Infantry forces is only meanssecuring facilities reconnaissance and of stiffening Russian morale unlessRussians request it. We consider supply materials and technical units more likelyto have effect.4. We would therefore urge that policy of this move should receive most careful reconsideration before it is undertaken. It is necessary to decide whether we are going to utilise our limited transportation resources from Persian Gulfto provide supplies, equipment and air support to help the Russians, or to sendInfantry forces at expense of equipment. We are not yet aware of what equip-ment and supplies it is intended to send by the Persian Gulf, but it is obviousthat sending of proposed force will greatly curtail amount that can be sent.5. Meanwhile, we will continue to make plans and preparations for forceand require to be informed at once whether base and non-divisional units will beprovided for 18th Division.
