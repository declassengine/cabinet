Allthe leaders of the Party - whatever their inward misgivings - cameforward,  and at the end of a few weeks all the Higher Command of congress and practically all former Congress Ministers in theProvinces were in prison^    The total figures grew, though not asformidably as either Government or Mr* Gandhi expected, up to atotal of nearly-14,000 in May,    But? outside the United Provincesthere was little public interest, and,from May onwards the figuresbegan to drop rapidly by the excess of expiring sentences overfresh convictions.    By October 1st they were down to 5^600 andar?c presumably well under 5,000 today.    In spite of Mr,&apos; Gandhi?s appeal there has been no desire on the part of his releasedfollowers to invite a second imprisonment.    The whole campaignhasj  in fact, been a complete failure, not only in so far as ithas failed to embarrass or sway the Government, but also in so faras it has failed to Interest the Indian public.    In the actualranks of Congress It has created confusion and depression.    Thereleased leaders have urged Mr, Gandhi to call the whole thing offin vain,-    He professes to be entirely satisfied and to be contentif only two remain in prison and the rest devote themselves to3Pinning03o The possibility of emphasising this&apos;failure by, at sometime or other contemptuously releasing the remainder of thesesymbolic protesters has, for some months past, been in the Viceroysmindj,  and, was,   indeed, bj\oug^ early , in.....the ^a-amm^C&quot;&quot;if eft heirhenor&apos; I were, however, in a &quot;hurry, to take&quot;the&quot;&quot;frne initiative, and the matter might not have come before the WarCabinet just yet, but for Mr, Joshifs motion before the Assembly .Which necessarily involved discussion of the matter by theViceroy f s Executive Council,4, At the first meetings of the Council on November 5th and6th&apos;   all the Indian members, Hindu and Moslem,  and, though withsome hesitation,  two of the four European members were in favourof immediate release of the symbolic satyagrahis, . though all were agreed that there could be no release of Communists, revolutionariesor real mischief makers.     The Viceroy^ conclusion, subject tothe views of the Provincial Governments, was in favour of releaseon the ground that we could not? afford to treat the movementcont emptuously,

r 5.        The interest of the Provincial Governments in this matter lies in the&quot;fact that the actual administration of the Defence of India Rules has been left in their hands and that they are responsible for law and order generally.Any repercussion of the Central Government&apos;s decision on this issue of releaseupon the general tranquillity of the Provinces is. therefore; very much their concern.     On the other hand; as the Viceroy pointe out in his telegram 2389-Sjthe Central Government has throughout assumed the responsibility of guidingand conducting policy in these matters;, and are, indeed, empowered to issuedirections upon them.6. Of the Provincial Governments all are in favour of release except theUnited Provinces and Madras, whose objections have been very forcibly urged bySir M. hallott and Sir A. Hope.     It is true, as the Viceroy points out inparagraph k- of telegram 6415 (which embodies his final conclusion&quot;, that these objections are mainly concerned *,rith the possible consequences of a generalpolicy of attempting to placate Congress and arc not strictly speakingrelevant to the narrower issue of a release.     Release, indeed, so far fromappeasing Mr. Gandhi, evidently may embarrass him, because it means theimmediate end of a movement which he knows he cannot revitalise.     Nor cangreat weight be laid on the apprehended estrangement of Moslem policy, in viewof the fact that release is approved of not only by the Moslem members of theViceroy&apos;s Executive, but also by the hoslem Premiers of Bengal, and the Punjab,who after their recent experiences with Mr. Jiuriah, are not likely to wish to reopen a quarrel with him.     But undoubtedly Sir M. Hallett&apos;s views as to theeffect on his Province of immediate-release -- and his subsequent telegram(see 2879-S; shows that it was immediate and simultaneous release that he mostobjected to - must carry great weight.7. They have evidently done so with the Governor General in Council whoseconsidered and now unanimous conclusion is embodied in the following effectivepassage of their proposed statement to the Assembly for which the Viceroy asksthe concurrence of the Mar Cabinet %-&quot;Government have no intention of relaxing measures they have already taken and will continue to take against activities or propaganda directed against war effort or calculated to promote mass disorder.     On otherhand they consider it no longer necessary to retain in custody personswho have been convicted or detained either for participating in civildisobedience movement or for having given notice of their intention todo so.     Within this category they include not only those who merelyrecited prescribed slogan but also those who accompanied it with a speechnot materially adding to its substance.     The Government of India have    Vtherefore decided to release forthwith all prisoners ass/ChiefCommissioners Provinces who fall within above categoiateh?.     They have advised all Provincial Governments to follow the same course and it isexpected that release of prisoners will begin as soon as possible andwill be completed as soon as administrative requirements permit.-!8, It will be seen that the Government of India while taking direct actionin the sphere of its own immediate control,  &quot;advises&quot; the provincial governments to follow the same general line, but leaves the time table of release to their own judgment of their respective administrative requirements.-/This should, I think, meet Sir M. Mallett, who sees no difficulty in aI] progressive release between this end the end of the year.9..        On the actual merits of the Government of India&apos;s conclusion it ispossible to have different views.     Personally, while, like the Viceroy, Ishould perhaps have preferred to wait a little longer I think the circumstancesnow justify release.     T do not believe that it will be regarded as in any sense a surrender, but only as the contemptuous liquidation of an absurdsituation which has never seriously embarrassed the Government, and whichnobody/

nobody? except Mr. Gandhi wishes to prolong.     The immediate effect on theattitude of Congress \/ill be nil.     Tho effect upon opinion here and inAmerica may bo good,, but I would net lay too much stress upon that.     Thereal importance lies in the effect upon moderate and pro-war opinion inIndia in support of tho Viceroy&apos;s new Executive.10. This brings me to the real issue before the &quot;Jar Cabinet.     TheViceroy is now working with a new Executive, predominantly Indian incomposition.     The new members are showing themselves keen in support oftho war, and the experiment has started most successfully as far as theViceroy himself is concerned.      I believe, too, that its continued successfulworking will as such, not only increr.se the efficiency of India&apos;s war effort,but help to reconcile moderate opinion to the continuance of the present constitutional position and so tide us over the war period.     To overridethe unanimous conclusion of the Governor-General in Council on a matter onwhich opinions may differ, hut on-which the balance of provincial opinion inIndia is with the Centre.! Government, and on which such objections as havebeen raised have been largely met, would put both Lord Linlithgow mid his council in a most embarrassing and almost impossible position.     the breakdown of the present most promising experiment would be a disaster, theconsequences of which might well be incalculable.     I, therefore, mostearnestly urge the War Cabinet to approve the unanimous conclusion of theGovernor-General in Council.I append to this note three further telegrams from the Viceroy,L.S. AiLEHYNovember,,. 16th,,P.S. The case of Pandit Nehru stands by itself,.     This was one, not ofsymbolic disobedience, but of a definitely mischievous series of speeches,The magistrates decision; however, to make the sentences of lo monthsimprisonment on the several counts consecutive and not concurrent, thusinvolving four years imprisonment, was felt universally to hive been excessive.Both the Viceroy and myself shared this vie,&apos;, but felt at the time that to override the verdict would be a grave mistake, and that any question of reduction must be left for a quieter time.     That time has, in the opinion ofthe Government of India now arrived.     My own inclination, which I have put to the Viceroy, would be to assume that the original sentences are to betreated as concurrent, which, taken with the usual reduction for good conduct,would let Nehru out early in the lie&quot;: Year.     This would preserve the clear distinction&quot;between his case end the others.     But I think the precisetreatment of this case might well be left to the Viceroy&apos;s discretion.

Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy dated cylifth November, 1941. (-JPrivate and pex-sonal.     secretary^et.

Personal.Your private and personal telegram dated November llj-th N0.I356 I ammost grateful to you for this information.     Question of executive responsibility-facilities has been prominently before us in our discussions in Council and it isfor this reason that we have proposed that draft announcement shall take theform of saying that we intend to take certain action ourselves in regard toChief Commissioners provinces and to &quot;advise&quot; Provincial Governments to takethe same course in their own.2.       - But though this formality maintains correct position we should I am quite certain be regarded as taking refuge behind a somewhat technical pointif we evaded the issues on these grounds because :(a) we have ourselves throughout assumed responsibility of guiding andco-ordinating policy of all provinces in regard to these matters.      this position has In fact throughout been recognised by H.II.Government who have discussed questions of All-India policy with us on the assumption thatProvinces would come into lino.     After all this we could not take isolatedaction without admitting that it would in fact force the hands of other(? provinces) whether they agreed or disagreed:   nor in fact in an All-Indiamatter of this kind could we openly disclaim responsibility for general policywhich has been pursued hitherto or leave provinces which had followed it inthe lurch;(b) Apart from these general considerations we have in fact the power ofissuing directions to provinces under&quot; Section 126A and we are advised andCouncil was informed that this power will extend even to the giving of directions to a province to use its power of remitting sentences under Section4-01 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.     While we should not of course wish touse this over-riding power in a matter which in normal times would have beenthe sole responsibility of provinces (subject however to Governor General&apos;spowers under Section 54 of the Act) we cannot in present circumstances weaken our own position to the extent of asserting that we have no right to control the action of the provinces in provincial field..

3. Both Bengal and the Punjab have cordially agreed with the policy put tothem and no other Ministerial province has raised any objection.4. In these circumstances I am clear that to announce that we are leaving it to &quot;provinces instead of advising them would have no practical significanceand would indeed be somewhat disingenous.     It would be likely to bring whole(sic ? attention to) form of government in Section 93 Provinces which might decide against under increasingly critical comment here (particularly inHope&apos;s case since he has no Indians amongst his Advisers).     It would at thesame time of course largely destroy the value to e;cpanded. Executive Councilof the gesture which they have recommended.     I should therefore be strongly opposed to it.SJCEET.Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State forIndia, dated l6th November, 1941. XXX969IMMEDIATE.2892j-s.     Private and personal.     I asked Lumley who is here on his way home from Peshawar for his views.     He feels that consequence of release will beto create amongst persons of moderate opinion a definite, feeling. that.policyij^Jaeing^liberalised and that Indian majority in Council has real power.     he thinks that in face of the war position it is most desirable to have this opinion solid behind a Council willing to back our arms through difficult days.He adds in his own words &quot;that to turn down release (which is quite harmlessexcept to Gandhi) now after much expectation has been aroused would inevitablyput back/ slide of moderate opinion towards us&quot;.
