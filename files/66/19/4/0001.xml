(41) 601)October 2, 1941TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR cabinet weekly RESUME(No. 109)of theNAVAL, MILITARY AND AIR situation from 0700 September 25th, to0700 October 2nd,1941[Circulated with the approval ofthe Chiefs of Staff.]Cabinet War Boom
NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   An important convoy from the United Kingdom has reached Malta.Shipping losses were considerable, although below the weekly average for thewar.   They were chiefly caused by U-boat attack.An Italian U-boat has been &quot;sunk in the Mediterranean.Home Waters.2. Motor Torpedo attacked a westbound enemy convoy in the straits of Dover on the night of the 30th/ 1st. In spite of unfavourable conditions theyprobably sank an escorting trawler, without suffering casualties or appreciabledamage.The s.s. St. Euman (436 tons) destroyed a twin-engined floatplane which attacked her in St. George&apos;s Channel, and H.M. Destroyer Atherstone probably destroyed a Ju. 88 off Land&apos;s End.A serious explosion of ammunition under examination occurred on board the s.s. Franconia (20,175 tons) at Liverpool. Four people were killed and twoinjured.It is estimated that, during the week, 16,500 tons of enemy shipping havebeen sunk or seriously damaged by our aircraft. Details are given under &quot; air situation.&quot;North Atlantic.3. H.M.S. Springbank (auxiliary A.A. and fighter catapult ship) was torpedoed during a U-boat attack on a homeward-bound convoy from gibraltar and sank, 600 miles north-west of Cape Finisterre, on the 27th. A considerablenumber of her ship&apos;s company have been rescued.Northern Waters.4. A Russian submarine entered Petsamo Harbour on the 26th and torpedoedone merchant ship of 8,000 tons and another of 5,000 tons, which were dischargingalongside.Mediterranean.5. An important convoy carrying- personnel and stores from the UnitedKingdom passed through the Strait of Gibraltar and arrived at Malta on the28th. Strong naval forces provided escort and cover. In the course of severalattacks by enemy torpedo-bombers south of Sardinia on the 27th, H.M.S. Nelsonwas hit by a torpedo, which reduced her speed, but caused no casualties. later in the day one ship of the convoy, the s.s. Imperial Star (12,427 tons), was torpedoed in the Sicilian Channel and subsequently was sunk by our ships afterher passengers and crew had been taken off. On the morning of the 28th, as a diversion, the island of Pantellaria was successfully bombarded, and while these operations were in progress units of the Mediterranean Fleet carried out a sweepfrom Alexandria. An enemy force of battleships, cruisers and destroyers was reported at sea operating between Sardinia, and Sicily on the 27th and 28th, butretired to the northward before our forces could bring it to action. An air striking force flown off from IT.M.S. Ark Royal Was unable to make contact owingto low visibility. Several important merchant ships taking advantage of thecover of H.M. Ships left Malta and arrived safely at Gibraltar. A total offourteen enemy aircraft was destroyed by our naval fighters and ships&apos; gunfireduring the operations. Our losses were three fighters, the crews of two beingrescued.6. H.M. Submarine Triumph, on patrol in the Adriatic, damaged onetanker and set another on fire off Ortina, and sank a ship off Sibenik (Dalmatia).H.M. Submarine Torbay chased a convoy into Candia harbour, Crete, where she
torpedoed a ship of 3,000 tons. Torbay later attacked anu possibly damaged a transport off Gaicloro Island (south of Samos).Between 1st July and 30th September, H.M. submarines operating in theJEge&amp;ii sank one U-boat, two tankers, four merchant vessels of 3,000 tons or above, and nine large schooners and caiques heavily laden with troops.Some 7,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or seriously damaged by Blenheim aircraft during the week.During the week twelve French merchant ships (upwards of 26,500 tons),eastward, and two (6,576 tons) westward, have passed Gibraltar under escort.Anti-Submarine Operations.7. An Italian U-boat was sunk 40 miles north-west of Algiers on the30th by H.M. Destroyer Gtirkha. There were no survivors. Three other attacks were made by surface craft in the Mediterranean during the week without visibleresults.Off the Canary Islands, ELM. Submarine Clyde unsuccessfully attacked two-boats and, later, was herself rammed by one, sustaining some damage.Seven attacks, all inconclusive, were made by aircraft in the eastern Atlantic.One of these, in the Bay of Biscay, appeared promising.Enemy Intelligence.Surface ships.8. It is reported that the German cruisers Leipzig and Emden recentlycarried out a bombardment of Russian shore defences in the Gulf of Finland area.The operations of the Tirpitz and the Admiral Scheer in the western Baltic, in company with the cruisers Numb erg and Koln and smaller craft, which were reported in last week&apos;s Resume, may have been to cover the bombarding force. Alarge warship, almost certainly the Tirpitz, was seen in Danzig on the 29th andthe Admiral Scheer arrived at Hamburg on the previous day. The Koln, Leipzigand Emden were seen at Gdynia on the 29th. There have been no other importantchanges in the dispositions of the Larger German units.An examination of the evidence as to the size of the Bismarck and Tirpitzindicates a standard displacement of about 41,000 tons.It is reported that the converted minelayer Konigin Luise was sunk on25th September in the course of minelaying operations in the Gulf of Finland.The Greek destroyer Vasileus Georgius I, which was sunk when Greece wasevacuated, and was salved, will be ready for service early in November, manned by Germans.TJ-Boats.9. About twenty-five German U-boats have been operating during the week.There have been two main groups, one in an area south-east of Greenland and theother to the westward of southern Ireland. There are indications that the enemymay be moving several U-boats to attack trade between Freetown and SouthAmerica and the West Indies.      .The British Consul at St. Vincent has reported that German U-boats were seen on the surface in Warrifal Bay, Cape Verde, on the 28th. There is alsoreliable information that a U-boat transferred stores and equipment.Enemy Attack on Trade.10. A homeward-bound convoy from Gibraltar was heavily attacked on threesuccessive nights during the week. Nine ships in this convoy were torpedoed, inaddition to H.M.S. Springbank. A tanker in an outward convoy was twicetorpedoed by a U-boat which she engaged with gunfire, 770 miles E.N.E. of new foundland. One ship in an outward convoy was torpedoed, 600 miles west of Ireland.One ship in a coastal convoy was bombed and sunk off the Humber. In an air attack on a Channel convoy one ship was damaged by a near miss and wastowed in to Dover.  This convoy was also ineffectively shelled by shore batteries.[22976] b
A total of six ships is now known to have been sunk in the U-boat attacks on the homeward-bound convoy from Sierra Leone, which were reported in lastweek&apos;s Resume.Protection of Seaborne Trade.11. During the week ending the 1st October, 931 ships, including 182 allied and 25 neutral, were convoyed. Sew1 anti-aircraft ships, 77 destroyers(including 20 United States destroyers) and 101 sloops, corvettes and mine-sweepers were employed on escort duties. Since the beginning of the war 83,116ships have been convoyed, of which 416 have been lost by enemy action.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the 27th September totalled 939,290 tons, compared with an average of 945,000tons during the past ten weeks. Oil imports were 409,321 tons; mineral imports were 222,916 tons, of which 144,958 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Wood and pulp imports amounted to 41,911 tons, copra and palm oil to27,559 tons and cereals to 59,832 tons. Other food imports totalled 99,759 tons,the principal commodities, in tons, being : sugar and molasses 41,413, refrigeratedand tinned meat, bacon and ham 10,278, cocoa 5,495, tea 4,651, fruit 4,378,evaporated milk 2,436. There were also 4,180 tons of unspecified tinned food.Tobacco imports were 2,150 tons. There were also large quantities of cotton,rubber, high explosives, motor lorries and machinery.British Minelaying.12 Motor launches have been particularly active in minelaying off the trench and Belgian coasts during the past week and have laid, in all, 107 mines.In addition to these, H.M. Ships Manxman and Welshman laid 314 mines in thenorth end of the East Coast Barrier. There has been a little minelaying by aircraft in the Baltic, the Bay of Biscay and the central Mediterranean.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.13. Minelaying by enemy aircraft during the week took place in the thames estuary, off the East Coast as far north at Flamborough Head, and off milford haven.Ten magnetic and ten acoustic mines have been destroyed during the week.The mine totals are: Magnetic, 1,437; Acoustic, 1,046; Contact, 1,062.Foreign Waters.14. Mines were laid off Tobruk on the 28th September. Five mines are reported to have been swept.Information has been received that there are mines off Mandahu, on the northBrazilian coast.Minelaying is suspected at the entrance to the White Sea.Enemy Merchant Shipping.Mediterranean.15. The Greek tanker Petrakis Nimikos (7,020 tons), now sailing underthe German flag, two German ships, the Maritza (2,910 tons) and Procida (1,842tons) and the Italian Avionia (1,122 tons) are reported to have sailed from thePirseus on the 24th September. Eight large merchant ships arrived in the Piraeusearly on the 26th September.A report from Istanbul states that the Germans are attempting, so farwithout success, to recruit Greek seamen in the Piraeus to remedy the serious shortage of stokers in Axis ships.The German Hans Arp (2,645 tons), arrived at Trieste on the 22nd Septemberprobably from Yugo-Slavia.   The German Macedonia (2,875 tons) arrived at
MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.18. During the past week fighting has continued on all parts of the front,but the main German effort has been made in the Ukraine, where the threat both to the Donetz Basin and the Crimea has increased. In the area of encirclementeast of Kiev major operations have ceased, but it is possible that sporadicresistance by isolated groups continues. The extent of Russian losses cannot beestimated accurately, but however severe they may have been, reports show that russian resistance further east, immediately outside the area of encirclement,is stubborn and effective. The German frontal attacks on the two approaches tothe Crimea are meeting with equally fierce resistance.Finland.19. In the far north a successful Russian counter-attack has driven theGerman forces attempting to reach Murmansk back on to the west bank of theRiver Litsa. In the region between Lakes Onega and Ladoga, the Finns claimto have extended their front and to have seized three hydro-electric power stationsserving Leningrad.Estonia.20. The Germans have now occupied most of the island of Oesel, and appearalso to have landed on Dago.Leningrad Sector.21. The ring round Leningrad has been shortened by a German advance tothe coast about ten miles west of the city. In other respects the situation hasnot changed.[22976] b 2Trieste on the 20th September from Greece.   The Italian Iseo (2,366 tons) isreported to be plying between Brindisi and Greece fortnightly.Owing to the damage to Tripoli harbour Germany is reported to be pressing for the use of Tunisian ports for the transit of troops and war material and current reports indicate that a certain amount of material&apos;for the Axis is beingshipped from Marseilles via these ports.vichy French Shipping.16. Secret sources have recently reported that Caronte, which is about a mileup the canal west of Marseilles, now handles cargoes of iron ore, phosphates andmanganese almost exclusively. Nine Vichy ships, totalling some 36,500 tons, are known to be engaged in this &quot;trade, and apparently Allied ships held by the Vichyauthorities are also being used, the Germans waiving claims to them if they are so employed.  French ships do not appear to go direct to Italy with these cargoes.A recent report states that the Vichy French Aveyron (4,785 tons) has been handed over to the Italians and renamed the Capo Pino. She was recently loadingminerals at Caronte for Genoa.Two French tankers, the Vendemiaire (9,228 tons) and Dauphine (9,716 tons)are due at the entrance to the Dardanelles on their way to the Black Sea.vichy French Intelligence.17.   Free   French   sources   at   Bathurst   reported   that   the   cruiserGeorges Leygues left Dakar for Casablanca with a large cargo of gold.
Central Sector.22. Apart from a slight German advance in the Demyansk area, no changehas taken place.Ukraine and Crimea.23. Organised Russian resistance immediately east of Kiev has ended,though isolated forces probably continue to inflict some casualties on the Germans.24. Once the junction had been effected between the two German armoured forces from Glukhov and Kremenchug and as soon as the position had beenconsolidated, an armoured thrust towards Poltava began. This met with strongresistance, but has, nevertheless, made progress. Poltava is now in german hands. A German armoured thrust southwards with the object of opening upthe Dnepropetrovsk bridgehead has succeeded in reaching Novomoskovsk. TheGerman eastward drive in the Melitopol area had been held up by strong russian resistance near Akimovka.25. The Germans continue to make a determined effort to penetrate intothe Crimea, both on the Arabat and on the Perekop Isthmus, where they are meeting very strong resistance. The main effort is being concentrated in thelatter area, where Russian resistance has made the German frontal attacks onthe narrow isthmus very costly. Nevertheless, it seems to be the German intentionto force a way through, and some progress has been made south of Perekop.26. The Russian forces between Perekop and the mouth of the Dnieper arecut off, but by means of counter-attacks supported by tanks they have forced theGerman troops in this sector on to the defensive.Odessa continues to hold out.Comment.27. It will be noted that, for the first time since the campaign began, thefront runs approximately in a straight line from north to south, and does not seem to offer the Germans obvious opportunities of encircling Russian forces, as has frequently been the case earlier in the campaign. The only obvious encirclingmovement remaining open to the Germans at present is a southward drive fromthe Dniepropetrovsk area to cut off the Russian forces north of the Crimea. TheGermans will, therefore, now have to make frontal attacks in order to resume their strategy of envelopment and annihilation.It is believed that the future course of the campaign may develop along thefollowing lines :  (a) The Germans will probably continue the investment of Leningrad andwill not attempt to reduce the city by means of a costly attack.(b) In the central sector, which has now long been quiet, the Germans maytry to capture Moscow before winter sets in.(c) In the south the threat to the Donetz Basin and to the Crimea continuesto dominate the position on the Russian front, and it is probable thatthe next immediate tasks of the Germans will be an advance onKharkov and the annihilation of the Russian forces in the Crimeaand east of Perekop. The serious aspect of both these operations was emphasised in last week&apos;s Resume. A successful advance on Kharkovwould open up the way for yet another outflanking movement down the River Donetz on Rostov-on-Don, with the object of cutting off allthe Russian forces immediately north of the Sea of Azov. This maybe regarded as a probable course for the Germans to adopt, since itwould bring them nearer to the Caucasus and to the eventual capture of the line of the River Don.Operations.Egypt and Libya.28. In the Frontier area normal enemy patrolling has been seen, otherwise the ground situation is quiet in all sectors. On the 26th September a patrolcaptured a staff car containing four junior Italian officers.
29. At Tobruk there is little to report with the exception of continued enemy air activity over the harbour and town, together with a certain amount of enemyshelling.A abyssinia.30. The Italian garrison of Wolchefit surrendered to British and Patriotforces on the morning of the 28th September, and the following prisoners are sofar reported : 71 Italian officers.1,560 Italian other ranks.1,450 African troops.British Somaliland.31. Our patrols are conducting local operations against armed raiders, andin a recent encounter with some 100 of them 16 of the enemy were killed and otherswounded.  Our casualties were 2 wounded.French Somaliland.32. The blockade of French Somaliland by land has been further tightenedby the co-operation of the Sultan of Aussa, who had hitherto been trading withthe Vichy French. Over 400 native refugees of British-protected tribes crossed the frontier from French Somaliland during the week.Persia-.33. Apart from clashes between Kurds and Persians in the area betweenthe Iraqi-Persian frontier and Senna, the situation has been quiet. The Kurdshave taken over the administration in the Saqiz area. A few of the Persianpolice have resumed duty on the frontier posts, and a small force of the Persianarmy has moved from Kermanshah northwards to the unsettled area, where theKurds have informed one of our patrols that they are. willing to send arepresentative to Senna for discussions.34. The handing over of Germans has continued, but there are still somewho had escaped to outlying villages. Steps are.being taken by the Persianauthorities to round them up.35. Our forces and the Russian forces still remain on the outskirts ofTeheran.Intelligence.Hungary.36. Admiral Horthy appears to have resisted the German demand for theimmediate despatch of further Hungarian troops to the Eastern front, and it isbelieved that he made a request for the withdrawal of troops already there, butthat this was refused. It is possible that General Werth was dismissed from his appointment as Chief of the General Staff owing to his willingness to accede to german demands, which exceeded what Admiral Horthy would grant.Roumania.37. Reports continue to stress the low state of morale both among civiliansand in the army itself. Desertions are now mentioned as a frequent occurrence.Roumanian losses on the Russian front are estimated at between 130,000 and150,000, out of a total of 520,000.38. Youths born in 1923 have been instructed to report for military service this week, and the 1924 class is to report on the 10th and the 11th October.Libya.39. There has recently been an increase in shipping direct to Benghazi,thought to be reinforcements rather than supplies. At a&quot;rough estimate, from60,000 to 70,000 men may have been sent to Libya between the 25th June andthe 18th September.
40. It is believed that the 21st German Armoured Division is now probablyup to establishment, and elements of a third division are now in Libya. Thenature of this division is not known, but there is no evidence whatsoever that itis armoured.41. An attack on Tobruk is thought to be more than likely in the immediatefuture, but considerable time must elapse before large-scale offensive operationsacross the Egyptian frontier can begin.Far East.42. Japanese operations in the Changsha area have developed on a larger scale than was at first anticipated. According to Japanese reports, Changshaitself was captured on the 28th September, while Chuchow, an important rail and road junction 32 miles further south, was entered the following day. On the30th September, however, the Japanese admitted that they were withdrawing from Chuchow. So far the Chinese deny the loss of Changsha and state thatthey have wiped out the Japanese parachute troops which had entered the cityon the 28th September.43. The main Japanese attack is being carried out by a force of two to three divisions, while parts of a further three divisions are protecting their left flank.44. The fact that the Japanese have been able both to withdraw troops from central China to Manchukuo, and to stage an operation of this magnitudewithout any apparent Chinese counter-action, must throw considerable doubt bothon the ability of the Chinese to contain Japanese troops in China, and on thereliability of recent reports, both Chinese and British, that a successful Chineseoffensive is possible.AIR SITUATION,General Review.45. Our bombers were unable to operate on two nights owing to threat offog and, on two other nights, aircraft which had been despatched were recalledfor the same reason. Attacks on the remaining nights included a raid on Genoa.Successful daylight sweeps were carried out by fighters on two occasions, but, on other days, activity was restricted by unfavourable weather conditions.46. Enemy activity against this country remained at a low level. Duringnaval operations in the Western Mediterranean, aircraft from Malta madesuccessful attacks against Italian aerodromes and seaplane bases in Sicily andSardinia.Germany, Northern Italy and Occupied Territory.Day.47. Bomber Command despatched 28 sorties compared with 129 last week,and dropped 9 tons of H.E. bombs and 88 incendiaries. Fighter Command flew698 aircraft sorties in the course of offensive operations against shipping andover occupied territory.48. On the 27th, two formations, each consisting of 12 Blenheims, attackedrailway objectives near La Bassee and at Amiens; buildings in both target areas were hit. From this operation, which was covered by 23 fighter squadrons, all our bombers returned safely. Our fighters destroyed 21 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed 12, and damaged 16. Thirteen of our fighters are missing but threepilots were rescued.49. On the 1st October, 11 fighter squadrons destroyed two enemy fightersduring an offensive sweep over Calais, probably destroyed three more and damagedfour. Three squadrons were despatched later to engage hostile aircraft raisedby this sweep but met with no opposition.   All our aircraft returned.
50. Except for the foregoing and the operations reported under &quot; CoastalOperations,&quot; activity in daylight was restricted by weather, though a number ofsmall offensive sweeps were undertaken, most of which were uneventful.Night.51. Bomber Command despatched 688 sorties compared with 230 last week.On two nights recall signals were sent out owing to fog coming up over homebases, and on two other nights no operations were possible owing to poor flyingweather.52. A total of 530 tons of H.E. bombs and 37,700 incendiaries were releasedduring the week. Railway and industrial centres, shipyards and docks inNorthern Germany were the principal targets, and Genoa was attacked on a moderate scale.53. Hamburg was attacked on two nights, and totals of 140 tons of H.E.bombs and over 7,000 incendiaries were released. Four 4,000-lb. H.E. bombs fellin the target area, two of them&quot; exploding near the West Altona Station andthrowing up considerable debris. Fires resulted in the industrial centre andalso in the docks, where part of a quay was blown up. The Pocket BattleshipAdmiral Scheer, lying alongside this quay, is considered to have been damaged,The first attack took place in excellent weather, but, on the second occasion,conditions deteriorated during the attack and, apart from bursts near a railway junction and many large fires, results could not be seen.54. Stettin was also attacked on two nights. On both occasions the weather was favourable and the total of 112 tons of H.E. bombs, supplemented by11,000 incendiaries, resulted in many large and small fires in the dock area andin the city. A warehouse was demolished, two ships in the waterway were seton fire and several bursts were seen near the railway station.55. On the 26th/27th a single Wellington (which did not receive the generalrecall signal sent out on that night) reached Genoa and bombed the railway station.Two nights later, 35 bombers attacked Genoa and 2 Turin. Bombs were dropped in the vicinity of the port and in other built-up - areas in Genoa;numerous fires were started, several of which merged together, the largest of thesebeing east of the harbour.56. Medium-scale attacks were made on Frankfurt, Cherbourg, Stuttgartand other targets in Germany and occupied territory, fires being reported in mostinstances.57. Beauforts of Coastal Command carried out a low-level attack onobjectives at Nantes; hits are believed to have been made on oil refineries, chemical works, shipyards and storage depots.United Kingdom.58. Fighter Command flew, in all their operations, a total of 1,889 sortiesby day and 508 sorties by night; the latter total includes dusk and dawnoperations.59. German Air Force operations over this country have been on a restrictedscale both by day and night. Only three aircraft crossed the coast by day. at night, apart from an attack on Tyneside on the night of the 30th September/1st October, when about 55 long-range bombers were plotted, the principal activity has been off the East Coast and in the Bristol Channel area, though a few aircraft,principally night fighters, have flown inland.Coastal Operations.60. Coastal Command flew 214 patrols (333 sorties), and provided 32 convoy escorts (128 additional patrols). Shipping protection patrols by fighter command totalled 502 (1,018 sorties).61. During operations against enemy shipping by aircraft from the threeCommands, the following were sunk : 2 minesweepers, 1 trawler, 1 small tanker,
1 motor boat and a barge. In addition, Hurricanes damaged 8 E-boats, 2 Flak-ships and a 100-ton merchant vessel, Hudsons set on fire a 2,500-ton tanker-typevessel, and hit merchant vessels of 2,000 and 10,000 tons; a 4,000-ton merchant ship is estimated to have been torpedoed by a Beaufort.Fifteen aircraft, including Manchesters, were despatched to lay seamines offBrest, Lorient, St. Nazaire, in the Baltic and off the Frisian Islands.62. Enemy activity by day consisted almost entirely of weather and shipping reconnaissances in the North Sea, off the Scottish coast and in the south-west.  Aircraft of the Condor unit have operated in the Atlantic, west of Ireland.63. Enemy defensive patrols over coastal areas of Northern France, belgium and Holland were generally on a small scale, although fairly strong opposition was encountered by our fighters in the offensive action on the 27th September.Daylight patrols off the Dutch coast have increased during recent weeks.64. At night, operations were undertaken against shipping, and minelayingwas carried out in the Thames Estuary on the night of the 26th.65. Although enemy air activity has recently been directed principallyagainst shipping in home waters, little success has been achieved. During theweek, two convoys were attacked off the east coast and one off Land&apos;s End. a vessel was also attacked near the Faroes.Central Mediterranean.66. Our fighters and bombers from Malta carried out many offensive opera-tions in Sicily and Libya, and, together. with our reconnaissance aircraft,assisted materially in the successful naval operation reported under &apos;&apos; naval situation.&quot;67. On the 27th, 37 Italian aircraft were severely damaged on the groundor at their moorings by cannon fire from Beaufighters during attacks on aero-dromes and seaplane bases at Marsala and Borizzo (Sicily) and at Elmas(Sardinia). Two bombers and a seaplane were attacked while landing, andprobably destroyed. On the 28th, Hurricanes made three attacks, totalling 54sorties, on Comiso aerodrome, dropping a total of two tons of bombs. On the29th&apos;j Beaufighters severely damaged nine more aircraft at Palermo, and on thefollowing day five Hurricanes again bombed Comiso.68. On four days a force of Blenheims made sweeps over the Gulf of Sirteand over the Tripoli (L)-Sirte road, and destroyed or damaged many vehiclescontaining troops, supplies or petrol. Store sheds were set on fire and a wireless station hit. A merchant ship of 1,000 tons was sunk, another of 3,000 tons lefton fire, and others were damaged by hits or near misses. A successful attack was made by eight Blenheims on industrial plants and on a power station atPorto Empedocle, 60 miles south-east of Marsala. Seven bombs fell on thepower station, and a silo, brickworks and road bridge were also hit. Two Blen-heim fighters machine-gunned one of two E-boats off Pantellaria, killing orwounding all the crew. A merchant ship of 3,000 tons in the Gulf of Tarantowas hit by three bombs and set on fire, and was last seen almost submerged.69. A total of 18 Wellingtons made two night attacks on Palermo harbour;bombs fell on the power station and in the shipyard and dock area, where two ships were probably hit. On another night Swordfish mined the harbour, while aWellington created a diversion by bombing the aerodrome. Three successfulnight attacks were also made on M.T. parks at Tripoli (L). and over 37 tons ofH.E. and incendiaries were dropped. Many fires broke out, and, during one ofthe attacks, &quot;merged into one vast conflagration.&quot; Swordfish and Wellingtonsalso mined the harbour.70. Italian aircraft approached Malta during four nights of the week, butdropped their bombs in the sea. Fighters twice approached the Island duringthe day, but did not cross the coast.
Eastern Mediterranean.71. Benghazi harbour continued to be the principal target of our nightbombers, which attacked it on five nights with a total of 42 aircraft. Severalhits were made on a merchant ship alongside and on small craft in the harbour,and many bursts and fires were observed on the Central, Cathedral and Julianmoles. A ship in Bardia harbour was the objective of several determined day and night attacks. During daylight, Blenheims and mary lands with fighter escort obtained near misses and probably caused damage to the ship, and at nightWellingtons made two hits and started large fires nearby. One enemy fighter was destroyed and six probably destroyed during these operations, against the loss ofthree of our day bombers.72. mary lands also flew 23 bombing sorties against enemy dumps andcamps in the Gambut and Bardia areas, and fighters escorted our reconnaissance aircraft and flew offensive sweeps over the forward areas. Our coastal shippingreceived fighter protection from Hurricanes, Tomahawks and naval Martlets.73. No attacks on Alexandria or the Canal Zone took place this week.Enemy activity was limited to one raid on Mersa Matruh and several on Tobruk,where little damage&quot; and few casualties were caused.74. On the night of the 27th/28th September, 11 Wellingtons from Egyptattacked Rhodes harbour. A building was destroyed and explosions and anumber of fires were caused.   One aircraft is missing from this operation.West Africa.75. Sunderlands, Hudsons and Hurricanes flew a number of shippingreconnaissances and anti-submarine patrols. On the 29th September aSunderland, reconnoitring Dakar in error, was engaged by four Vichy Mohawkfighters. Our aircraft, and another which joined it, was damaged, and several of the crew were wounded; one of the Erench fighters was destroyed and the others damaged.Russia.British Air Operations.76. During the week weather has hindered our fighter operations, but14 patrols were flown, 12 of which were escorting Russian bombers. Five Germanfighters were destroyed without loss.Russian Air Operations.77.   There is no information of Russian air operations.German Air Operations.78. Over the greater part of the front, operations appear to have been generally on a low scale following the encirclement of Kiev. Although theGermans appear to be pressing in slowly from Poltava towards Kharkov, air operations on the southern sector of the front have been mainly concentrated insupport of the attack on the Crimea, where the land forces have made little progress. At&apos; the same time, air operations over the Black Sea continue, andOdessa has been heavily attacked; it is believed that mining operations have beencarried out against Sevastopol harbour.Spanish Air Contingent.79. The Spanish Air Force unit despatched to Germany soon after theoutbreak of the war against Russia is reported to have left Berlin, after a periodof training, for the Eastern Front.

APPENDIX YII.Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from air reconnaissance and Intelligence sources :  Germany.Berlin. Assessment of damage from a photographic reconnaissance on the16th September is hampered by cloud which obscured a large part of the city.Two areas of extensive destruction have, however, been identified, both in theLichtenberg district, one covering approximately 21,000 square yards and believed to be the result of a 4,000-lb. bomb, the other in railway workshops to the east ofthe Schlesicher Station. In addition, there are thirteen items of severe damage,two of which are in the neighbourhood of the Potsdamer Station and one in the engine shed near the Gleisdreieck Station.In the raid of the 7th/8th September an A.A. battery in the Tiergarten wassilenced and a tower thought to be an observation post damaged.Kassel. Photographs taken on the 21st September show extensive damage to the south side of the main railway station, where the roof has been destroyed for a length of over 370 ft. Two buildings at the entrance to the station havebeen gutted, and in the Herman Strasse houses on both sides of the street havebeen destroyed, on the east side over a length of 200 ft. The principal featuredisclosed, however, is the almost complete destruction by fire of the Palace andthe Frideric Museum. The Palace, the former residence of the Elector of Hesse,housed in peace time a valuable collection of pictures and tapestries. The FridericMuseum housed the provincial library, one of the best known in Germany, which contained among other valuable original manuscripts those of &quot; Grimm&apos;s FairyTales.&quot;Karlsruhe. In the raid on the 17th/18th September two engineering works were damaged and four large barges sunk in the harbour.Cologne. Serious damage has been caused to the cable works of Felten andGuillaume       result of seven hits by heavy bombs.Stettin. In the raid of the 19th/20th September, a cement factory and ashipbuilding yard were damaged. Traffic on the Berlin-Stettin canal was inter-interfered with as a result of the sinking of several barges which had been hit.Hamburg. In raids in the second week of May, three submarines under construction at Blohm &amp; Voss were damaged beyond repair, and on the 15th/16th September a motor vessel employed in the iron-ore trade was hit and sankin the harbour.France.Brest. Several reports have been received of repairs necessitated by damage to the battle cruisers and the Prinz Eugen. On the 20th September the position was considered to be as follows : (i) Gneisenau. Extensive repair work is in progress and she is unlikely to be ready for service for a long time,(ii) Scharnhorst may undock at any time, but is unlikely to be ready forsea for a week or two.(iii) Prinz Eugen reports indicate that  damage she has sustained  is sufficiently severe to keep her in dock for some time yet.Le Havre. Photographs taken on the 17th September show extensive damage caused in the dock area since the 24th July, and over 12 items of major damageare noted.
Gosnay. Photographs taken during-the attack on the 21st September showthat both the power house and the chemical works received direct hits. Inaddition, numerous bombs burst on the adjoining railway sidings and rolling stock and the coal conveyor and oil pipeline which cross the railway sidings werewrecked.Lille. Photographs taken on the 21st September show severe damage to thesouth-east corner of the railway workshops and probable damage to the westernend of a building adjoining the workers&apos; houses.Cherbourg. Photographs taken during the attack on the 20th Septembershow a stick of bombs bursting on the submarine shelters on the west side of theBassin Napoleon III. Bursts are also seen on harbour craft and near to a verylarge barge.Hazebrouck. Photographs taken during the attack on the 20th Septembershow direct hits on the eastern end of the marshalling yard at the point where thetracks converge to form a bottleneck, and also on the railway track branching tothe south.   In addition, a large engine shed and rolling stock were hit.Holland.Ijmuiden. In the raid of the 21st August on the steel works the drawingoffice and one shop were completely demolished. There were some Dutch casualties,but a number of German soldiers and a German architect were also killed. It isthought from photographs taken on the 26th August that production at thisworks has probably been reduced by 30 per cent.
