this document is the property of his britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1941./SECRET. v   /W.P. (W) 2s5-October .31, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.Copy No.WAR CABINET.DEFENSIVE CO-OPERATION IN THE FAR EAST WITH THENETHERLANDS AND THE UNITED STATES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.CONTROL of the new Japanese Cabinet is to all intents and purposes inthe hands of the Army, and it is clear that none of Japan&apos;s aims in the Far Easthave been relinquished. The new Government will no doubt try at first to attainthese aims by intimidation and negotiation rather than by fighting, but they aremaking preparations for further military moves. Whether these are directed,in the first place, against Russia, Thailand or China, the ultimate objectiveremains the Netherlands East Indies, Malaya and other British territory in theSouth-West Pacific.2. Events in Europe, combined with the gradual pressure of the freezingmeasures, are pushing Japan towards a decision to act sooner rather than later.It is incumbent on us, therefore, without loss of time to strengthen the main coreof our defence in the Far East and to seek to deter Japan by consolidating stillfurther the front which we are gradually establishing with the Netherlands andthe United States. In particular, it is suggested that the next step should be to close ranks with the Dutch.3. So far we have no reciprocal defensive understanding with the Dutch.The position is that, in a note of the 5th September to the Netherlands Minister,the Netherlands Government were informed of our acceptance, as a basis for future planning, of the technical recommendations of the A.D.A. Staff Conver-sations at Singapore of the 22nd-25th February and of the B.D. Conversationsof the 27th April. (Approval of the A.D.B. Conversations of the 21st-27th April was withheld pending further discussion with the United States.) Onthe political side, the note repeated what I had been authorised to say to theNetherlands Minister on the 1st August, namely, that His Majesty&apos;s government considered themselves to have already assumed the duty of safeguarding andrestoring the possessions and rights of the Netherlands to the best of their abilityduring the war and at the peace. It followed, therefore, that an attack upon theNetherlands East Indies would lead His Majesty&apos;s Government to do the utmostin their power to this end. His Majesty&apos;s Government must, however, remain the sole judge of what action or military measures on their part were practicable and ;likely to achieve the common purpose. : ;. .4.   Now all this is somewhat indefinite and it is secret.   It does not providetne basis of that complete understanding and mutual confidence which is vitally necessary to ensure effective co-operation in defence when the attack comes.   TheNetherlands Government have no certainty that they can count on our immediate11534   [23091]
support at the very outset. The Dutch people have no certainty that they can count on our support at all. Finally, we on our side have no assurance that wecan count unfailingly on the resources of the Netherlands East Indies if Webecome involved in war with Japan, more particularly if the war begins with ahattack not on Malaya but on Hong Kong or Burma.5. The War Cabinet has considered this problem on several occasions durino-the past year, and has had the advice of the Chiefs of Staff upon it. reluctance to give the Dutch a complete guarantee has turned largely on the consideration that our own resources, especially naval, were not large and on the absence of an assurance of United States support. Gradually, however, our resources in theFar East are increasing. It has also become increasingly clear not only that a japanese attack on the Netherlands East Indies would inevitably involve us also,but that United States inteiwention is a strong probability, having regard to the direct interest of the United States in these areas, concerning which the UnitedStates Government have lately given Japan a solemn warning.6. In these circumstances, I would strongly urge that the time has come toremove the present uncertainty and to seek a formal defensive agreement withthe Netherlands Government whereby each party would undertake to co-operateimmediately to the fullest extent of its available resources in the event of the other party being forced to take military action to counter an attack upon any of itsterritories in the Far East.7. Any such defensive arrangement, to have its full effect, ought to republic, and publication, far from being provocative, is likely to have a deterrent,effect on Japan. If Japan strikes at all, she will strike at the most propitiousmoment. She is not likely to strike prematurely because measures are being taken which are unwelcome to her.8. Care would have to be taken that the agreement was not announced in sucha way as to emphasise the absence of a similar close understanding between both,the Dutch and ourselves on the one side and the United States on the other. We&apos;cannot expect any commitment by the United States at this stage. It should be our aim, however, to obtain from the United States some simultaneous public statement to show that the agreement had been concluded with their full know-ledge and with their blessing.9. We must recognise, of course, that an agreement with the Dutch maylead to renewed requests from Chiang Kai-shek for a somewhat similar agreementwith the Chinese Government to cover the case of an attack by Japan on the burma Road. I do not think that we should allow this to deter us from making such arrangements as are within our present capabilities, and it is on this groundthat I suggest we should justify to Chiang Kai-shek the arrangement with theDutch and resist its extension to China for the present.10.   My proposals are, in brief, that I should be authorised (a) to examine with the Netherlands Government the possibility of a formaldefensive agreement as described in paragraph 6, to be concluded onthe British side on behalf of the Governments of Australia and NewZealand as well as the United Kingdom; and(&amp;) to keep the United States informed of the progress of negotiations, andto endeavour to secure from the United States, in the event of anagreement being reached with the Netherlands, some declaration toshow that the agreement had the whole-hearted support of the UnitedStates Government.11. If my colleagues are prepared to approve these proposals, the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs will no doubt think it necessary, in the first place,to consult the Governments of Australia and New Zealand. The views of thelatter upon my communication to the Netherlands Minister of the 5th Septemberare contained in the annexed telegram, to which I would invite the attention ofmy colleagues.A. E.Foreign Office, October 31, 1941.
Teleqram from, the Government of New Zealand to Dominions Office,dated September 16, 1941.(No 388.  Most Secret.)YOUR telegram of 6th September, M. No. 295.His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealand have given careful considerationto the proposed formal reply which the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs is to present to the Netherlands Foreign Minister, and they wish to state thatthey are not without apprehension as to the effect on the Netherlands Govern-ment of the qualifications which His Majesty&apos;s Government in UnitedKingdom propose to attach to their attitude in respect of the Japanese action inthe Netherlands East Indies. It seems probable that, instead of &quot; serving to allay the uncertainty which the Netherlands East Indies have shown on several occasions,&quot; the formal record which is to be sent will actually serve to give grounds for further doubts and disappointment. For their part, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in New Zealand hold to the opinion that any overt action directed againstthe Netherlands East Indies by Japan must inevitably lead to British armedintervention, and, assuming that, as the Netherlands Foreign Minister&apos;s broad-cast statement seemed clearly to indicate, the Dutch guarantee given on 6th May was clear and definite, it seems both reasonable and wise for the BritishCommonwealth to give an equally clear reciprocal guarantee. It is fully agreedthat action should not be taken automatically by the Commanders on the spot inthe eventualities mentioned in paragraph 24 of the report of the SingaporeConference of 22nd-25th February, as the Commander-in-Chief, Far East,apparently envisaged. From this it seems to His Maiesty&apos;s Government in NewZealand that the British Commonwealth should not hesitate to make it known that they are fully prepared to take all possible military measures in theseeventualities, and that this should be done, moreover, in a manner more explicitthan that which is now proposed. The views of this Government concerning thisquestion have been voiced on a number of occasions, and there is no need for anyreiteration of the arguments already put forward. It is also fully appreciated that war with Japan must be avoided for as long as possible, but it does not seemto the Government of this Dominion that the position of the British Common-wealth in the Far Eastern area would be in any way worsened by giving to theNetherlands East Indies the complete guarantee which they are seeking.
