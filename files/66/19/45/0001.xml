THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.MOST SECRET. Copy No. 1QW.P. (41) 272.November 15, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document,WAR CABINET.RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues for consideration at the Cabinet on the17th November copies of telegraphic correspondence exchanged in recent weekswith His MJajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Russia on the subject of our relations withthe Soviet Government.A. E.Foreign Office, November 15, 1941.(1)Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Kuibyshev).(No. 2.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Of/ice, October 21, 1941.Following for Ambassador :  I told Soviet Ambassador on 17th October that I understood that M. Stalin,&quot;in conversation with Lord Beaverbrook in Moscow, had raised the question ofthe future relations between our two countries, not only during the war, but after,and had suggested some form of an alliance. I was not quite clear what was inM. Stalin&apos;s mind in latter respect,,but could assure the Ambassador that HisMajesty&apos;s Government desired toThaintain and consolidate the friendship now established with the Soviet Union. I should always be glad to hear any soviet proposal to this end.Ambassador seemed gratified and undertook to telegraph to his Government.(2)Sir S. Cripps to Mr. Eden.(No. 14.   Most Immediate.)(Telegraphic.)   &apos;, Kuibyshev, October 23, 1941.I took Citrine to see Molotov this morning and the interview lasted over two hours.   Molotov raised whole question of British army fighting somewhereto assist the Russians.   Citrine will take back with him a verbatim report andwill see the Prime Minister and you about his interview as soon as he arrives.11550   [23155] b
2. The main point of importance, beyond the stressing of the need for twoarmies to fight the Germans at the same time and not one by one, was that neitherMolotov nor Stalin were aware that any answer had been given to these requestsin his September message to the Prime Minister for the assistance of 25 to 30divisions on the Russian front. Molotov said that the Soviet Government had accepted the decision that we could not create a second front, but there had been no answer as to our joining forces on the existing front. I told him my impression was that reply to this request had been given to the Soviet Ambassador and alsoin the Prime Ministers message to Stalin. Unfortunately, Ismay had not beenable to see Stalin (Ismay can explain the circumstances in which much to myregret his interview failed to materialise) and Ismay could have explained thesituation to him.3. It is obvious that it is a tragic mistake that this explanation was never given.4. I explained not having any documents now available that myrecollection was that we had said it was impossible to send 25 to 30 divisionsanywhere, but that the matter would be kept under constant review, and that ifan opportunity occurred to send a smaller force it would be taken. I promised to telegraph at once to ascertain whether this was the correct answer, and if so totell Molotov officially that this was our reply.5. It is very clear that in the present disturbed psychological atmospherehere this question is of absolutely vital importance to our combined futureresistance and success. Nothing must be done to discourage the Soviet Govern-ment at this moment, and if an encouraging answer can be sent it is vital that itshould be.6. Surely, it is possible to send either to Murmansk or through Iran at least one or two fully armed divisions to fight on the Russian front. Ismay discussed this with General MacFarlane when he was here.7. The effect of such an announcement at this most critical juncture of thewar on this front would be very great, and I beg you will do your utmost toenable me to give this encouragement to the Soviet Government.8. At any rate in your reply please do not close the door to such assistance,and, if necessary, I would ask you, unless help can be promised at once, to delayyour reply till Citrine has had an opportunity of seeing you.9.   Molotov flying to Moscow to-day to see Stalin, who remains there.(3)Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Kuibyshev).(No. 23.   Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, October 23, 1941.I told Soviet Ambassador, on 16th October, that I much regretted that military necessity had caused departure of Soviet Government from Moscow (ofwhich he had no confirmation), but that we appreciated the determination of soviet Government to continue the struggle indicated by this move. Ambassadorsaid fight would certainly continue.2. M. Maisky added that two sectors of Russian front had now becomespecially important, the Murmansk area and the Caucasus. Soviet Governmenthad information that Germans were reinforcing troops in Murrnansk area by sea and Ambassador asked whether we could not make determined effort to put a stopto this traffic, which would much relieve strain on Murmansk.3. As regards Caucasus, Ambassador said that defence of this area was mostimportant issue of all and asked for an indication of our attitude. I referred to prime Ministers explanation to Stalin on this subject in message which youdelivered to Molotov on 13th October and said we thought useful first step wouldbe for us to relieve bulk of Russian forces in Persia, thus freeing them forCaucasus. Soviet Government might leave token force to indicate maintenanceof their general position in North Persia, and we should be willing, I thought,if desired, to send token force to Caucasus to show solidarity with Russians.M. Maisky appeared to approve suggestion and raised no difficulties on the subjectof Russia&apos;s interest in North- Persia.   He maintained, however, that these
reinforcements might.not prove enough. He asked whether General Wavell wouldhave authority to discuss at Tiflis greater British reinforcements for Caucasusthan token force.4. I replied that relief of Russian forces in Persia would in itself constitute a further commitment for us and that I could not state what we could do beyond this. If Soviet Government wished for further reinforcements, they would nodoubt tell us their view. If we had to supply munitions and necessities of warthrough Persia to Russia, it would appear difficult to maintain important british force in the Caucasus, even if available.5. On 17th October M. Maisky reiterated his anxiety about the Caucasus.If the C aucasus were lost to Russia, Hitler would have sufficient oil for his own needs, but it would be very difficult for Russia to continue the fight, since she would have insufficient oil supply.(4) &apos;Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Kuibyshev).(No. 40.   Most Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, October 25, 1941.Following from Prime Minister : &apos;&apos; Your telegram No. 14* of 23rd.&quot; You were of course right to say that the idea of sending &apos; twenty-fiveto thirty divisions to fight on the Russian front &apos; is a physical absurdity.It took eight months to build up ten divisions in France only across theChannel when shipping was plentiful and U-boats few. It is only with thegreatest difficulty that we have managed to send the 50th Division to theMiddle East in the last six months. We are now sending the 18th Divisiononly by extraordinary measures. All our shipping is fully engaged, and anysaving can only be made at the expense of our vital up-keep convoys to theMiddle East or of ships engaged in Russian supplies. The margin by whichwe live and make munitions of war has only narrowly been maintained. Anytroops sent to Murmansk now would be frozen in darkness for the winter.&quot;2. Position on the southern flank is as follows: -Russians have five divisions in Persia which we are willing to relieve. Surely these divisions should defend their own country before we choke one of the only supply lineswith the maintenance of our forces to the northward. To put two fullyarmed British divisions from here into the Caucasus or north of the Caspianwould take at least three months. They would then only be a drop in thebucket.&quot;* See (2),(5)Sir S. Cripps to Mr. Eden.(No. 22.  Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Kuibyshev, October 25, 1941.As you will see from my telegrams No. 14* and 4,t Mossy, the feeling inGovernmental circles as to lack of armed help from us is very strong indeed. I also have information that the same feeling is current among the soldiers, andI have little doubt that, in view of Government publicity, there is much the samefeeling among the population as a whole.2. There is no doubt that relations between the two countries, as reflectedhere, are getting worse and not better. It is clear to us here that, if we cannotrelieve pressure on the Russians by action elsewhere, the only way in which wecan improve matters is to send some troops to this country.3. Until something is done I am reasonably certain that we shall find moreand more difficulties in the way of co-operation, and it will become increasingly difficult to do anything except to make arrangements as regards supplies, whichare accepted most ungraciously and without a word of thanks..* See (2).[23155]t Not printed.
4. There is an obsession that we are sitting back and watching them, andnothing will dispel it except concrete action on our part to relieve pressure on Russian front. I make full allowance for the fact that Molotov and others arestressing this point for reasons of policy, but I am satisfied beyond doubt thatthere is also a wide-spread general obsession with this question. Officially, I ambeginning to be anxious as to result of this on morale generally. If the sense ofisolation continues I think it may result in a crack of morale during the winter,when conditions will inevitably be very bad throughout most of the country.Already and after harvests there are reports of serious food shortage from varioussources, and so far as the Russian people as a whole are concerned, real trial ofwar will only come this winter. We cannot exclude the possibility thatdisappointment and disillusionment may even affect morale to such an extent asto count Russia out of the war altogether. I hope this aspect of the situation will receive full and immediate consideration.5. I am quite confident that the Government are determined to fight on,but, should the situation continue to deteriorate without the country&apos;s feeling ofisolation being countered, it is perfectly conceivable they will not be able to doso. Crisis is now at its height. We can either continue our present policy, inwhich case I cannot guarantee that Russia will not collapse, but I can guarantee that our relations will go from bad to worse. Or we can take military actionimmediately, which, in my opinion, would help definitely to tide Russia at anyrate over this serious crisis.6. I realise fully the military difficulties involved, but I give it as myconsidered opinion from this angle that promise of immediate despatch of a forcenot less than a corps, with an adequate proportion of R.A.F., to either northernor southern extremities of the Russian battle-front is probably our only hope of checking a dangerous deterioration, not only in the will of Russians to resist,but also in our relations with Soviet Government.7. I have consulted heads of Military Mission, and they are in agreementwith me, but desire that I should stress the fact that these suggestions are onlya temporary remedy, and that whatever we send, the Russians will inevitablypress for more.(6)Sir S. Cripps to Mr. Eden.(No. 27.   Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Kuibyshev, October 26, 1941.Your telegram No. 40.*Following for Prime Minister : &apos;&apos; A drop or two in a bucket or in a tumbler may make a great deal of difference where a stimulant is urgently needed.&apos;&apos; 2. You will realise that the Government here has never yet had our difficulties explained fully to them owing to unfortunate fact that no inter-view was arranged for Ismay when he was here. They are not familiar with difficulties of overseas fighting and matters can only be explained to themadequately by someone who has the whole of the necessary information athis fingers&apos; end. This, of course, I cannot do, nor could anyone here without first returning to England in order to get the whole background and all relevant information up to date.&quot; 3. If I were to announce to them the decision of the [group undecypherable] under reply, they would merely regard it as a decisionannounced without adequate explanation, and they would be no moreconvinced than before, with the result that our relations would not becomeany better but more difficult than they are now, and that is saying agood deal.&apos;&apos; 4. They are more likely to respond with: a maximum effort on their ownfront if the matter can be fully discussed with them by someone who cananswer their technical questions with up-to-date knowledge and information.See (4).
&quot;5. In view of their highly suspicious outlook they are only likely tofind, confirmation of their theories about our behaviour in your second para-graph. They will imagine that we want to take advantage of their difficulties to gain control of the whole of Persia, and no assurances willconvince them to the contrary. They will argue that if we can afford troops to replace theirs in Persia, then we can spare them to go to one of the activefronts and fight the Germans.&quot; 6. They are now obsessed with the idea that we are prepared to fightto the last drop of Russian blood as Germans suggest in their propaganda,and they interpret every action either from this point of view or else fromthe point of view that we are sitting back and resting while they are doing the fighting. If we made an attack in Libya they will no doubt interpretthat as our taking our chance of conquering Africa while they are holdingthe Germans for us here, and in their - present frame of mind they will not regard it as any contribution to their defence, but rather as our taking advantage of their situation. It will tend, I suspect, to confirm their viewthat we are using them for our own benefit.&quot; 7. We have never yet explained to them frankly over here our own position. I do not know how far you may have done so in London, but thatis in any case not the same thing. All Stalin receives is Maisky&apos;s version,which would hardly disclose arguments put forward, as that would be, andhas been, awkward for him vis-a-vis the powers here.&quot; 8. All this only emphasises once more how tragic it is that Imsay hadno chance of talking this matter over fully with Stalin and Shaposhnikovwhen he was here, when misunderstanding which they clearly have of thesituation could have been dealt with and possibly disposed of. GeneralMacFarlane and I have been specifically instructed not to communicate the explanation sent to us to the Russians. The only suggestion I oan make now is that Ismay or some other person equally well qualified and instructedshould come here at once to consult with them and to give the whole storyfrankly and any information which is necessary in order to convince them of what we can and cannot do. The only alternative to this is that I andGeneral MacFarlane should return to London to get those instructions andthen return here with full authority to explain the whole matter to them.I could ask them if they object to this, but I am sure that they would welcomeit as they did when I suggested coming last time and was prevented.&quot;9. If we are allies, as you have announced, surely they should notmerely be told that we cannot send any troops to help them, but should also have the opportunity of discussing the matter, so that they can make any suggestions and put forward any arguments that they may considerconvincing.&quot; 10. I am not for the moment communicating comments of yourtelegram under reply, as neither Molotov nor Stalin are here, and it wouldnot do just to hand, it as a message to Vyshinski, as that would lead to evenmore misunderstanding.&quot; 11. Molotov may be returning shortly, though I have no information at present about his movements. When he does return he will no doubt expect the answer I promised him on this matter.&apos;&apos; 12.   Please read in connexion with this telegram my telegram No. 22.*&quot; 13. I do regard the situation between the two countries as serious,and the situation here also serious from the morale point of view, as well asfrom the military aspect.&quot;* See (5).COMr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Kuibyshev).(No. 47.  Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, October 28, 1941.Your telegram No. 27.*Following from the Prime Minister :-&quot;1. I fully sympathise with you in your difficult position, and also withRussia in her agony.   They certainly have no right to reproach us.   They* See (6).
brought their own fate upon themselves when, by their Pact with Ribbentrop,they let Hitler loose on Poland and so started the war. They cut themselvesoff from an effective second front when they let the French Army be destroyed.If, prior to 22nd June, they had consulted with us beforehand, many arrange-ments could have been made to bring the great help we are now sending themin munitions earlier. We did not, however, know till Hitler attacked them whether they would fight or what side they would be on. We were left alonefor a whole year while every Communist in England, under orders from moscow, did his best to hamper our war effort. If we had been invaded and destroyed in July or August 1941, or starved out this year in the Battle ofthe Atlantic, they would have remained utterly. indifferent. If they had moved when the Balkans were attacked, much might have been done, butthey left it all to Hitler to choose his moment and his foes. That aGovernment with this record should accuse us of trying to make conquestsin Africa or gain advantages in Persia at their expense or being willing tofight to the last Russian soldier, leaves me quite cool. If they harboursuspicions of us, it is only because of the guilt and self-reproach in theirown hearts.&quot; 2. We have acted with absolute honesty. We have done our very best to help them at the cost of deranging all our plans for rearmament andexposing ourselves to heavy risks when the Spring invasion season comes.We will do anything more in our power that is sensible, but it would be sillyto send two or three British or British-Indian divisions into the heart ofRussia to be surrounded and cut to pieces as a symbolic sacrifice. Russia has never been short of man-power, and has now millions of trained soldiersfor whom modern equipment is required. That modern equipment we are sending and shall send to the utmost limit of the ports and communications.&quot; 3. Meanwhile, we shall presently be fighting ourselves as the resultof long-prepared plans, which it would be madness to upset. We have offered to relieve the five Russian divisions in Northern Persia, which can be done with Indian troops fitted to maintain internal order, but not equipped to face Germans. I am very sorry that Molotov rejects the idea of our sendingmodest forces to the Caucasus. We are doing all we can to keep Turkey a friendly r neutral and prevent her being tempted by German promises of territorial gain at Russia&apos;s expense. Naturally, we do not expect gratitudefrom men undergoing such frightful bludgeonings and fighting so bravely,but neither need we be disturbed by their reproaches. There is, of course,no need,for you to rub all these salt truths into the Russian wounds, but Icount upon you to do your utmost to convince Russians of the loyalty,integrity and courage of the British nation.&quot; 4. I do not think it would be any use for you and Macfarlane to flyhome now. I could only repeat what I have said here, and I hope I shall never be called upon to argue the case in public. I am sure your duty is toremain with these people in their ordeal, from which it is by no means certain that they will not emerge victorious. Any day now Hitler may calla halt in the East and turn his forces against us.&quot;r   / (8) - ,Sir S. Cripps to Mr. Eden.No. 37.   Immediate.   Secret.)^Telegraphic.) Kuibyshev, October 30, 1941.Following for Prime Minister: &apos;&quot; I have delayed answering your telegram in order that I might have time to give the matter fullest consideration.&apos;&apos; Your telegram No. 47*I am afraid that your first three calculations are of no assistance to-]me in answering Molotov&apos;s question (see my telegram 14, t paragraph 5), still less in persuading the Russians that there are good reasons from both ourpoints of view why we are unable to help them by sending armed forces to* See (7).t See (2).
this country. I cannot, for instance, tell them that &apos; it would be silly to send2 or 3 divisions into the heart of Russia to be [group undecypherable, 1 cut]to pieces as a symbolic sacrifice &apos; or that it is too cold to [group undecypher-able] to send our troops to Murmansk.&quot;2. I have already pointed out to you that I personally am not in aposition to explain matters to the Soviet Government, having no detailed information either of my own or through the Ministry Mission as to our plans and resources save those which I have been expressly instructed not to discloseto them.&apos;&apos; 3. You will recall that it was thought worth while to send the foreign secretary and the Chief of Imperial General Staff for some weeks to theMiddle East, in order to try and organise the defence of the Balkans whenconditions there becomes serious, and yet so far as this country is concerned,where conditions are no less important from our point of view, not only is his Majesty&apos;s Government unwilling to enter into consultations with theSoviet Government as to the best method of employing our combined forces against the common enemy, but they are apparently not prepared to give theSoviet Government a reasoned statement through the mouth of someone fullyqualified by status and knowledge to explain matters to Stalin.&quot;4. If you will compare our attitude to the Greeks in concerting action with them and our present attitude to the Soviet Government, you will, I am sure, realise how big the contrast between the two approaches. And yet itcould hardly be denied the Soviets are now more important to us as Alliesthan the Greeks ever were. Even with the Turks, who have never fought theGermans,&quot; there have been visits by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Chief of Imperial General Staff, and offers of staff consultations suchas have never been made to the Russians. To offer such treatment as we are doing to people whom we call our Allies gives the appearance either that wedo not trust them or that we do not think they are worthy to be consulted.Neither action is likely to encourage the Russians.&quot; 5. I am not concerned now any more than you are by Russianreproaches from any moral point of view, but I am greatly concerned by suchreproach, based on feelings of distrust and disappointment, from point ofview of their possible effect upon continuous resistance of the Russian armyand people; and if you are not similarly disturbed I am afraid you under-rate this possibility, and the ultimate effect of the feelings which give rise toreproaches is creating most serious difficulties for us when, as a result ofthe defeat of Hitler, for which they may be largely responsible, we have towork out with them a basis for European peace.&quot; 6. I realise that the Soviet Government have only made one officialrequest for military discussions through Maisky just before Supply Con-ference was held here. It having been turned down they are not likely toask for another refusal, but this does not mean that they have given up thedesire. It is clear to me that in the absence of a full and frank exchange of views we are not going to be able to convince Stalin of our inability up tothe present to help the Russians by land.&quot; 7. Hitherto the Soviet staff have displayed a marked lack of co-opera-tion and communicativeness in their dealings with the Military Mission, butthey let the Mission understand some time ago that as soon as we could do something on land to relieve the German pressure they would be preparedto take the Head of the Mission into their confidence. I have, as you know,had the same impression conveyed to me on more than one occasion.&quot; 8. This is the reason why I associate the two matters of consultation and some form of assistance on land front, since I feel if we were to initiateconsultations solely for the purpose of explaining we could do nothing, weshould not materially improve the situation, though it might help in preventing a deterioration. This can only be done by an explanatory visit by Ismay as already suggested.&quot;9. I do not believe it is profitable now to argue as to the responsibilityfor the present condition of affairs, though of course there is a great deal to be said for the point of view that you put forward. Russian suspicions.are much longer dated than you would seem to imply. They have increased,during the last twenty years by the atmosphere of political antagonism which,started with the intervention by us on behalf of the White Russians.   But
we must surely accept the circumstances as they exist, and, in relation tothose actual circumstances, we must follow the best policy that we can nowdevise to defeat the common enemy.&quot; 10. I am certain that in order to make the best possible use of the combined anti-Axis resources it is not enough that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment should merely tell the Russians that we can or cannot do this or thatbut we must be ready to take part in consultations with them as to thedisposal of the combined forces to the best advantage, naturally maintaining our control over the dispositions of the British troops.&quot;11. We seem to be trying to carry on two relatively unrelated warsto the great benefit of Hitler instead of a single war upon the basis of a combined plan.&quot;12. I am not in the least concerned with the difficulties of my own position, but I am most concerned with and about the success of the combinedfight against Hitler. We have at the moment an ally on this front withvast, though diminishing, resources. He is killing the Germans as best hecan and in great numbers, and I am desperately anxious that our policy should not be such as to discourage him in any way.&quot; 13. It appears to me that we are treating the Soviet government without trust and as inferiors rather than as trusted allies. This attitude is similar to that which we have adopted ever since the revolution, and hasbeen the cause of great resentment by the Soviets, and is, I believe, liable to discourage them in their efforts to hold on. Whether they deserve such treatment or not seems to me to be beside, the point at this critical juncture.The point now is to keep them fighting as long and as energetically aspossible.&quot; 14. Unless we are prepared to discuss with them the whole situationand the best way to use our combined forces, I believe that we can do little,if anything, to improve our relations or their staying power. That is theone and only reason why, upon the basis of my short experience here andthe best estimate that I can make of their reactions, I feel so very stronglyabout this matter.&quot; 15. With reference to paragraph 9 of my telegram No. 27,* I am stillconvinced that these are the only two ways by which an answer can be given without doing more harm than good, and I am without an answer as to thefirst alternative suggested. You will bear in mind that I have promisedMolotov an answer (see my telegram No. 14,t paragraph 5).&quot;* See (6). t See (2).(9)Sir S. Cripps to Mr. Eden(No. 39.)(Telegraphic.) Kuibyshev, October 30, 1941.Your telegram No. 2.*I understand from this that Lord Beaverbrook has reported to you on his political conversations with Stalin. As he had no time while in Moscow to tellme anything at all about them, I should be grateful for as full an account aspossible of what passed.* See (1).(10)Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Kuibyshev).(No. 54.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, October 31, 1941.In conversation on 27th October Soviet Ambassador said that, if, as he understood, we had been considering possibility of offering to send a force to aid Russia, he hoped we should not suggest sending a token force, but wouldmake a plan and propose it to Soviet Government on the basis of sending so many troops, say, at the end. of the year, and further forces as they could be
made available. He thought it was a matter of tremendous political importance that British forces should fight side by side with the Prussians on Russian soil.A proposal merely to send forces to Caucasus was likely to arouse Soviet suspicionsowing to conflict between our forces and theirs in that area in the past.2. Soviet Ambassador reverted to same subject on following day, when i expressed regret that M. Molotov should have rejected our suggestion for despatchof a modest force to the Caucasus on the ground that it was not a battle front.I pointed out that such action would release certain Russian forces, as would alsoour relief of Soviet forces in Persia, but Ambassador said his Government would find it difficult to understand why we could send forces to Caucasus but yet notsend them to the battle front. I replied that I understood this from political point of view, but said that on military side it would surely be foolish to sendsmall force far into Russia where it could not contribute to influence result of conflict, but would only create additional problems of supply and maintenance and adversely affect supply routes to Russia. Ambassador did not seem convincedand reverted to his suggestion for a plan and programme mentioned in preceding paragraph.(11)Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps ([Kuibyshev).(No. 60.   Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 1, 1941.Your telegram No. 14,* paragraph 2 [of 23rd October].2. For your information following is summary of note by Mr. Harrimanof conversations between him, Lord Beaverbrook and Stalin during the moscow conference.3. There was considerable discussion regarding military co-operation withRussia. Lord Beaverbrook offered strategic discussions with General Ismayduring the conference and invited the Russians to send a mission to england to consider the British problem and to give advice on what might be done and, inaddition, information as to what had been learnt by the Russians in their recentbattles with the Germans. Lord Beaverbrook indicated that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were building up divisions in Persia which might be joined up with russian forces in the Caucasus, and that General Wavell was proceeding toTiflis for conversations on these lines. Stalin&apos;s comment on this was that therewas no war in the Caucasus but that there was one in the Ukraine.Lord Beaverbrook indicated that this question might also be taken up.Lord Beaverbrook asked Stalin if he thought the British could invade France, towhich Stalin replied that he did not know enough about the situation, but hadconfidence in the Prime Ministers judgment. He enquired, however, why a force could not be sent to Archangel or the Ukraine.* See (2).(12)Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Kuibyshev).(No. 69.   Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 2, 1941.Following from Lord Beaverbrook : &apos;&apos;. Your telegram No. 39,* asking for an account of my politicaldiscussions with Stalin. Harriman made a complete record of all ourmeetings, and with his authority I send you quotations relating to politics.At the first meeting at the Kremlin, on Sunday, 28th September, Harrimanstates :  &quot; There was considerable discussion all the way through the talkregarding British Military co-operation with Russia.&quot; Beaverbrook offered strategic discussions with General Ismayduring the conference and invited the Russians to send a mission toEngland to consider the British problem and give advice on what mightbe done, plus education on what the Russians had learned in their recentbattles with the Germans.* See (9).[23155] c
&quot; He indicated that the British were building up divisions in Persiawhich might be joined in the Caucasus with the Russians. Wavellwas proceeding to Tiflis for conversations along these lines. Stalincommented &apos; there is no war in the Caucasus, but there is in theUkraine.&apos;  Beaverbrook indicated that this plight be taken up, too.&quot;Beaverbrook asked Stalin if he thought Britain could invadeFrance. Stalin said he didn&apos;t know enough about the situation, but had confidence in churchill&apos;s judgment, but why not send a force to archangel or the Ukraine?&quot;Stalin asked about peace objectives and Beayerbrook spoke aboutthe Eight Points and then got on the subject of the importance of peaceobjectives in America and American public opinion and urged Stalinto use the American press to build up a better understanding in Americaof Russia.&quot; I asked him whether he had any other ideas about peace terms.He turned to Beaverbrook and said : &apos; Are the Eight Points going tosatisfy you ?&apos; Beaverbrook was non-committal and I asked what stalin had in mind. Stalin said : &apos; What about getting the Germans to pay for the damage ?&apos; Beaverbrook dodged the answer with some generalityabout &apos; We must win the war first.&apos;&apos;&apos; At the second meeting, on Monday, 29th September, the discussions were confined to supply.   Political questions were not raised.&quot; At the third meeting, on Tuesday, 30th September, Harrimanrecords : &apos;&apos; Stalin asked Beaverbrook about Maisky, whom Beaverbrook thenextolled, indicating his only difficulty was the persistence and force ofhis presentation of Russia&apos;s needs.[Here follows discussion between Stalin and Harriman onOumansky and Steinhardt.]&quot; Stalin asked about Hess, and seemed much interested inBeaverbrook&apos;s amusing description of his talk with Hess and his size-upof the situation. Stalin indicated that he thought Hess had gone notat the request of Hitler, but with the knowledge of Hitler, to whichBeaverbrook agreed.&quot; The net of Beaverbrook&apos;s statement was that Hess had comethinking that with a small group of aristocrats a counter-ChurchillGovernment could be set up to make peace with Germany, which wouldbe welcomed by the majority of the British. Germany, with British aid,would then attack Russia. Stalin relished the amusing and detailedcomments by Beaverbrook.&quot; Beaverbrook put up the subject of help to Turkey, and explainedthat some of the munitions, like the 1,000 25-pounders which Stalin had turned down, might make the difference in Turkey&apos;s decision. Stalinagreed that it would be a good thing, if possible, but that Turkey doesnot behave like an ally. Stalin said : 5 You must be sure that helpwon&apos;t be lost.&apos;&quot; Beaverbrook indicated that he thought help might re-establish the alliance. Stalin said, however, that Turkey was afraid of Bulgariaon account of her German alliance and the help Germany would give.The subject was left in the air.&quot; Stalin asked if the blockade had been extended to Finland.Beaverbrook thought so, but would check. Finland had becomeimpertinent, Stalin said. First they had asked for the return of theirfrontiers only, but now they were the complete tool of Germany. TheFinnish armies had long since crossed the old frontiers and were nowin Russia.&quot; In reply to Beaverbrook&apos;s question, Stalin asked that the blockadeshould include Finland. He asked whether any food came from America.Beaverbrook said not froni America, but perhaps from Denmark. Stalinasked that the British threaten to declare war on Finland, and then asked me about our threatening to break with Finland. I asked, to be clear, whether he meant threaten to break off diplomatic relations orto do so. He said &apos; threaten.&apos;  I said I wodld investigate and advise him.
&quot; Stalin asked Beaverbrook if the present military alliance and agreement of no separate peace should not be extended to a treaty, an alliance not only for war, but for post-war as well. Beaverbrookanswered that he personally favoured it and believed it was an opportunetime to take it up.&quot; Stalin remarked that all the Soviet Government officials favoured the proposal.&quot;I brought up the question of China, and said that we were sending a military mission and were giving help. Stalin said he was glad themilitary mission was going but that China had stopped fighting. Therehad been no military operations for some months. He had sent themsome airplanes some months ago and artillery, but they had not askedfor any more since. I asked him why they had stopped fighting, andhe shrugged his shoulders and said : &apos; Perhaps preparing.&apos;&quot; Stalin asked how stuff was getting in and I explained &apos; Over the burma Road.&apos; He suggested an alternative route which I didn&apos;t get.Beaverbrook interrupted : &apos; No, over the Burma Road.&apos;&quot;He said that his neutrality agreement with Japan did not interfere with the Soviets giving aid to China. He asked why we didn&apos;twean Japan away from Germany. I indicated that I thought some progress was being made, since it was clear that England and theUnited States were working so closely together.&quot; Stalin said it was his impression that Japan was not Italy and isnot willing to be a serf to Germany, and therefore could be won away.&quot; I asked about information concerning the Siberian air fields. Hesaid General Chaney was to see General Golikov and the information would be given.&quot; If you require discussions about supplies, let me know and I will send you Harriman&apos;s account.&quot;(13)&apos; - Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Kuibyshev).(No. 78.  Most Immediate.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 4, 1941.Please pass following telegram to M. Stalin at earliest possibleconvenience : &quot;Prime Minister Churchill to Premier Stalin.&quot; (Personal and Secret.)&quot;1. In order to clear things up and to plan for the future I am readyto send General Wavell, Commander-in-chief in India, Persia and Iraq, tomeet you in Moscow, Kuibyshev, Tiflis or wherever you will. Besides this.General Paget, our new commander-in-chief secretly designate for the far east, will come with General Wavell. General Paget has been in the centre of things here, and will have with him the latest and best opinions of our high Command. These two officers will be able to tell you exactly how west and, what is possible and what we think is wise. They can reach you in about a fortnight.   Do you want them?&apos;&apos; 2. We told you in my message of 6th September that we were willingto declare war on Finland. Will you, however, consider whether it is reallygood business that Great Britain should declare war on Finland, hungary and Roumania at this moment ? It is only a formality because our extreme: blockade is already in force against them. My judgment is against it -because,first, Finland has many friends in the United States and it is more prudent to take account of this fact. Secondly, Roumania and Hungary: thesecountries are full of our friends : they have been overpowered by Hitler and used as a cat&apos;s-paw. But if fortune turns against that ruffian they might,&apos; easily come back to our side. A British declaration of war would only freezethem all and make it look as if Hitler were the head of a grand Europeanalliance solid against us.   Do not pray suppose it is any want of zeal or-[23155] - c 2
comradeship that makes us doubt the advantage of this step. Our Dominions,except Australia, are reluctant. Nevertheless, if you think it will be a realhelp to you and worth while, I will put it to the Cabinet again.&quot; 3. I hope our supplies are being cleared from Archangel as fast asthey come in. A trickle is now beginning through Persia. We shall pumpboth ways to our utmost. Please make sure that our technicians who are going with the Tanks and aircraft have full opportunity to hand these weapons over to your men under the best conditions. At present our Missionat Kuibyshev is out of touch with all these affairs. They only want to help.These weapons are sent at our peril, and we are anxious they shall have thebest chance.   An order from you seems necessary.&quot; 4. I cannot tell you about our immediate military plans any more thanyou can tell me about yours, but rest assured we are not going to be idle.&quot;5. With the object of keeping Japan quiet we are sending our latestbattleship, Prince of Wales, which can catch and kill any Japanese ship,into the Indian Ocean and are building up a powerful battle squadron there.I am urging President Roosevelt to increase his pressure on the Japanese1 &apos; and keep them frightened, so that the Vladivostok route will not be blocked..&apos;] &apos; &quot; 6. I will not waste words in compliments, because you know alreadyfrom Beaverbrook and Harriman what we feel about your splendid fight.Have confidence in our untiring support.&quot;7. I should be glad to hear from you direct that you have receivedthis telegram.&quot;. ...    f &apos; (14)Sir S. Cripps to Mr. Eden,&apos;No. (58.   Immediate.)Telegraphic.) Kuibyshev, November 5, 1941.Following for Secretary of State : &quot; (Personal and Secret.)&quot; Your telegrams Nos. 60* and 69. t&quot; I am amazed that these most important&apos; conversations should be now reported to me for the first time and that apparently little notice has been;     taken of them by anyone at all.&quot;2. The matter of the discussions, with possible exception of point (g)and to a certain extent point (h) in paragraph 3 below, appears to have been left completely in the air, and I can now well understand that the SovietGovernment may be assuming that they are not considered important enough-even to merit an answer. In the meantime I have been talking to them ona number of topics covered by these conversations and I presume that theythink, either that I am most disingenuous in not disclosing any knowledgeof them, or that I am so little trusted by His Majesty&apos;s Government that Iwas not given any information about them.&quot; 3. The following seem to me to be the points of primary importance which were touched upon :- &apos;&apos; (a) British military co-operation with. Russia including an offer of: strategic discussions.   (So far as this is concerned, it would seem that, in view of my efforts to persuade Lord Beaverbrook to let me arrange a meeting between Ismay and Stalin and failure ofthese efforts, there must be some misunderstanding on this point;,i,        1 at any rate, I am sure that Ismay cannot have been aware of theoffer reported that [sic] have been made by Beaverbrook to Stalin,i ..       and certainly neither I nor the Head of the Military mission was aware of it.). (b) Russian Mission to England to: consider British problems, and give advice on what might be done.&quot; (c) The sending of British troops to the Caucasus or Ukraine...   .        (d) The sending of a force to Archangel. ;&quot; (e) Whole question of peace objectives and of Atlantic Charter and; &apos;&apos;&apos;    . suggestion that the Germans should be made to pay for the war.&quot;Wi- * See (11). t See (2).
&quot; (/) Question of giving help to Turkey.&quot; (g) Situation regarding Finland and the blockade and the questionof a declaration of war on Finland by His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot; (h) Stalin&apos;s suggestion for extension of the present military alliance between Great Britain and the U.S.S.R. to a treaty covering thepost-war period as well.:    &quot; (?&quot;) Question of aid to China and. attitude of the Soviet government towards pact with Japan in this regard. -&quot;&apos;4.   I will not trouble Beaverbrook to send me a report of discussions about supplies, as this was his job, and not mine which is political sphere.&quot; 5. Clearly, Harriman&apos;s report is very scrappy. Though no doubtperfectly adequate for his own purposes, it is very difficult, if not impossible,to judge from it the importance to be attached to the various points, none of which, save (g) and to some extent (h) (see your telegram No. 2), seem tohave been followed up.&apos;&apos; 6. For instance, point. (h) was apparently pressed by Stalin, andBeaverbrook expressed his agreement to it, and said that the moment wasopportune. If, after this, no proposals for such a Treaty are put forward,it may well be taken by the Soviet Government as implying that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are not anxious to take the matter up; and this may be a factor in the present difficulty of our relations with the Soviet Government, as constituting another reason for their distrust.&quot; 7. The failure to inform me of these conversations is all the moreunfortunate in that, if they were accurately reported, they must obviouslymodify some of the views which I have expressed about the general trend ofopinion of the Soviet Government.&quot; 8. For instance, (a) and (b) are equivalent of strategic consultations which I have suggested, and if in fact the matter was discussed it shouldhave been possible to gauge Stalin&apos;s reaction to it, and from that reaction to judge how important he considers the matter. If that reaction was negative,then I have, of course, misjudged the situation, and all my advice in thismatter is quite useless.&quot; 9. In this connexion I notice that Stalin was told of General Wavelhsintended visit and of the reason for it, which was political one, discussing the nature of help to be given. If I had ever been told that this was intendedI should have advised his going to Moscow for those discussions and shouldhave asked for instructions about the political implications of the offer.&apos;&apos; 10. Points (e) and (h) are of very first importance. As you are aware,I have been pressing His Majesty&apos;s Government to make up their minds upon these questions, so that discussions could be initiated here as soon as possible and while going was good for that purpose.&quot;11. I regard point (h) as most important of all.&quot; 12. It must be remembered that Molotov was present at all these discussions, but that at Beaverbrook&apos;s request, and since the conversationswere only to concern the matters which he came out to discuss -which I understood to be questions of supply I was not present. This has, of course,put me in an entirely false position as regards Molotov and probably explainsa phrase which he used to me the other day and to which I did not thenattach any significance. When I was pointing out that I had urged upon HisMajesty&apos;s Government a certain course of action, he remarked that he was afraid that I had no power of persuading them. This is probably due to hisquite natural view that I am now excluded by His Majesty&apos;s government from political discussions about the U.S.S.R. and therefore (? have no)influence when advising them on policy.&quot; 13. In these circumstances I can see no use in my remaining here toact as an occasional post-box (for messages to Stalin about the formulation of which I:am not consulted and which I am not instructed to discuss withhim) unless I can do something to contribute to winning of the war orassisting, in the post-war settlement.&quot; 14. The one and, only way in which I might still be able to help isif I am authorised to, take up at once; suggestion made by Stalin under,point (h) above.   I would then try to get permission to go to Moscow andtalk the matter over with him personally. ,
&quot; 15. It would of course be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government tohave some general idea as to the way in which the post-war situation was tobe tackled if we are to arrive at an agreement with these people to work with them after the war. The first and fundamental thing to decide is thatwe are prepared to continue collaboration with them after the war is over for the purpose of working out terms of the new settlement of Europe.&quot;16. If you agree to this, then we should be ready to discuss at once the basis for a treaty with them to that effect.&quot; 17. Basis should be that Great Britain, United States and U.S.S.R.will subsequently, and before the peace conference, negotiate an agreementcovering broad lines of a European settlement, and that we undertake toenter consultations with the Soviet Government in this matter at an earlydate.&quot; 18. We could also include in the treaty an undertaking to assist one another mutually in reconstruction and an agreement regarding non-inter-ference in one another&apos;s internal affairs. I would suggest also a clausesimilar to that in the Turkish-Soviet Treaty to the effect that after the warneither party would enter into any new agreement with a neighbour of theother without first informing the other of its intention- to do so.&quot; 19. The four clauses would be quite sufficient as a basis to start on,and we could then see what the Soviet Governments ideas were as to anyother terms. The fact of negotiation of such a treaty would, I hope, help to draw the two countries closer together and thus to overcome present difficulties.&quot; 20. I am most anxious that the unfortunate circumstances describedearlier in this telegram should somehow or other be made to yield good resultsrather than bad. I am unconcerned with the personal side of the matter,provided that I can do something useful now; but otherwise you will appreciate that my position has been made such that it would be much better for you to send someone else here.&quot;21. I have therefore come to quite definite conclusion that, unless Ican now be of some use in negotiations of the sort described above, you willbe better served by someone else in this post. If I find in the course of such negotiations that my position has been rendered such as to make me anunsuitable person to conduct them, I should, of course, let you know at once.&quot; 22. I should be glad of your decision on this point as soon as possible,as I cannot remain long in the present unsatisfactory situation, in which i cannot do my job or usefully represent His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;(15)Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Kuibyshev).(No. 96.   Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 6, 1941.My telegram No. 78,* paragraph 1.Soviet Ambassador, to whom I had shown text of my telegram under reference, asked me yesterday morning whether persons concerned would be in position to discuss future plans. I said that clearly they would from terms ofreference given in telegram. Ambassador explained that Soviet GovernmentwOuld be anxious to discuss preparations for the spring. It was important to try and wrest the initiative from the Germans. A second front had been ruled out, but we should discuss where we could most usefully take an initiative, if itwere in our power to do so, and then lay our plans, concentrate our efforts andsend our supplies accordingly. I said that these were obviously matters that could be discussed.2. At interview later in day the Ambassador reverted to Stalin&apos;s request to us to send forces to help Russia in the South and in the North. He said wehad never given any final reply about this and asked whether proposed discussions in Russia would cover question of despatch of troops to help Russia in the South.* See (13).
I said I thought there should be no misunderstanding on this issue. Stalin had spoken of twenty-five divisions or thereabouts. The Prime Minister had made it plain that it was quite outside our powers to despatch such a force. We had offered to relieve Soviet troops in North Persia and send a small force to theCaucasus, but the Soviet Government had not accepted these offers.3. Ambassador then asked whether, if Stalin were to say that he did not want a British force in the Caucasus but would welcome one at, say, Rostov, thismatter could be discussed at proposed meeting. I replied that I would referquestion to Defence Committee but that my own impression was that, if Stalinmade such a request, it could be discussed and advantage would no doubt be takento. explain amongst other things relation of this question to that of delivery ofsupplies. Dilemma was that, if we sent troops, we should have to supply them at expense of deliveries of material to Russia.(16)Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Kuibyshev).(No. 115.  Immediate.)(Tellrya?etgLm No 96 * &quot;&quot;^ 0ffWe- N0^ler 8- 1941p^tBtMm^yS^ AmbaSSadOT *M -P&apos;y * 1- question in* See (15).(17)Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Kuibyshev).(No. 121.   Immediate.   Personal and Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 10, 1941.Your telegram No. 68.*I much regret that you should feel that you have been put in a false position by not having been informed earlier of the political discussions between lord Beaverbrook and Stalin.2. Maybe we have now given you a false impression of their importance byextracting every item of diplomatic consequence out of conversations of fifteenhours on supply. Beaverbrook is quite sure that Stalin did not attach importanceyou attribute to these exchanges, and he knows that Harrinlan shares his view.Beaverbrook throughout made it plain that his mission was not politics but supply,and asks me to assure you that there were no serious diplomatic talks at all. Iam sorry that it was not possible to make all this plain to you before the missionleft Moscow, but you will be the first to make allowances for the high pressureunder which the work of the mission was put through.3. Meanwhile, I do not think that we have lost any time at our end indealing with those of the nine questions which you enumerate which aresusceptible of immediate treatment. For instance, as regards (a), you will now have seen from my telegram No. 781 that we have offered to send General Wavelland General Paget to Moscow or anywhere else convenient to the SovietGovernment.4. As regards (b), the position is that a proposal was put to Stalin byLord Beaverbrook and we have received no response.5. As regards (c), the question of sending British troops to the Caucasusor the southern front has been repeatedly discussed with the Soviet Ambassadorhere, and is still under consideration (see my telegrams Nos. 23,:]: 54$ and 961f).6. As regards (d), for practical reasons (see my telegram No. 40H), whichhave been explained to the Soviet Ambassador, we have not followed up thisquestion. Nor has M. Maisky shown any great interest in it; his concern isclearly with the southern front.7&apos;. As regards (e), at the present stage when it is so impossible to predictwhat the situation at the end of the war will be, it is really quite impracticable to formulate our peace objectives for discussion with our allies more definitelythan is done in the Atlantic Charter.* See (14). t See (13).If See (15).I See (3). 5 See (10).[f See (4).
8. As regards (/), it is the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to continueto furnish Turkey with military supplies as far as we are able to do so, havingregard to our promises to the Soviet Government. As the Soviet Governmentknow this, I do not see that the matter requires further discussion with them atthis stage.9. As regards (g), we are waiting for Stalin&apos;s reply to the Prime Ministersenquiry in my telegram No. 78.* As for the blockade, the situation is that Finlandis subjected to the total blockade as being a country in enemy occupation: Wehave, indeed, applied every measure to Finland which we would apply in the caseof a declaration of war save the internment of Finnish subjects in british territory.   M. Maisky has been told this.10. As regards (h), I agree that we ought to begin examining the questionof our post-war relations with the Soviet Government as far as it is possible todo so at the present stage of the war. We certainly are prepared, as suggestedin your paragraph 15, to continue collaboration with the Soviet Government afterthe war is over for the purpose of working out the terms of the new settlementof Europe. I am, however, at present in some difficulty because I have not received any explanation from Stalin as to what he himself had in mind whenhe proposed a post-war alliance (see my telegram No. 2t to Kuibyshev). This isunderstandable enough in present conditions when no doubt he has infinitelymore urgent matters with which to deal. The important thing is surely thatthe Russians should know that we are prepared to carry forward our collaboration with them into the peace and beyond. This has been explained to M. Maiskyand I shall be grateful if you will emphasise our general attitude in this respectto Stalin or Molotov at any convenient opportunity. When, however, we cometo consider methods, the time is surely not yet ripe for us to commit ourselves to the undertaking to enter into early consultations with a view to an agreementcovering the broad lines of a European settlement. Nor have the SovietGovernment asked for any such engagement. This brings us back to paragraph and the difficulties about formulating our peace objectives in any detail at thepresent stage. But even if we cannot embark straight away on detailed negotiations, I hope that, as the war situation improves and develops, we shall find more frequent opportunity of discussing with the Soviet Government plans for future collaboration not only during the war but also at the peace settlement.This gradual and tentative procedure, I think, will prove both safer and moreprofitable than if we were to attempt prematurely to define our collaboration intreaty form. In a treaty we should both have to introduce so many provisos andconditions to safeguard our position in the unforeseeable future that the result might well be to arouse suspicions and misgivings on both sides which mightinjure rather than improve relations between our two countries. But even ifwe do not embark upon definite negotiations straight away, I am convinced that your services in Russia as His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador will be of the gratest value in preparing the ground so that these negotiations can be undertaken with every prospect of success at the appropriate moment.11. As regards (i), we have hitherto hesitated to consult the SovietGovernment in detail regarding the Far East, partly because they have show no disposition to discuss this subject with us, and partly because we could notprofitably take the initiative without greater knowledge than we have so far been able to obtain of the United States attitude, which is clearly the key to thewhole Far Eastern situation. We are engaged in exchanges with the UnitedStates Government on this subject now and will, of course, keep you posted.* See (13). f See (1).(18)Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Kuibyshev).(No. 122.

(19)Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Ktdbyshev).(No. 136.   Important.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 12, 1941.The following personal message from Stalin, dated Kremlin, .8th November,was handed to Prime Minister by Soviet Ambassador on 11th November : &quot; Your message received on 7th November.&quot;1. I fully agree with you that clarity should be established in therelations between the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain. Such a clarity does not exist at present. The lack of clarity is the consequence of two circum-stances : &apos;&apos; (a) There is no definite understanding between our two countries on war aims and on plans of the post war organisation of peace.&quot; (b) There is no agreement between the U.S.S.R. and Great Britain onmutual military assistance against Hitler in Europe.&apos;&apos; As long as there is no accord on both these questions there can be noclarity in the Anglo-Soviet relations. More than that: to be quite frank, aslong as the present situation exists, there will be difficulty to secure mutual confidence. Of course, the agreement on military supplies to the TJ.S.S.R.has a great positive value, but it does not settle, neither does it exhaust, thewhole problem of relations between our two countries. If the General Wavelland the General Paget, whom you mention in your message, will come to moscow with a view to conclude agreement on two fundamental questions referred to above, I naturally would be happy to meet them and to discuss with them these questions. If, however, the mission of the Generals is confined to the questions of information and to the consideration of secondary matters, it would not be, I think, worth while to intrude upon the generals. In such a case it would be also very difficult for me to find thetime for conversations.&quot; 2. It seems to me an intolerable situation has been created in thequestion of the declaration of war by Great Britain to Finland, hungary and Roumania. The Soviet Government raised this question with the BritishGovernment through the secret diplomatic channels. Quite unexpectedly forthe U.S.S.R., the whole problem beginning with the request of the SovietGovernment to the British Government and ending with the considerationof this question by the United States of America Government received wide publicity. The whole problem is now being discussed at random in the press friendly as well as enemy. And, after all that, the British Governmentinforms us of its negative attitude to our proposal. Why is all this being done ? To demonstrate the lack of unity between the U.S.S.R. and GreatBritain ?&quot; 3. You can rest assured that we are taking all the necessary measures for speedy transportation to the right place of all the arms coming from great Britain to Archangel. The same will be done&apos;with regard to the route through Iran. In this connexion may I call your attention to the fact although this is a minor matter that tanks, planes, artillery are arrivinginefficiently packed, that sometimes parts of the same vehicle are loaded indifferent ships, that planes, because of the imperfect packing, reached usbroken ?&quot; STALIN.&quot;(20)Sir S. Cripps to Mr. Eden.(No. 98.)(Telegraphic.) ,: Kuibyshev, November 13, 1941.: Following for Secretary of State :  &quot; (Personal and Secret.)! &quot; Your telegrams Nos. 121* and 122. t&quot; I am grateful for this explanation, but I do not understand how thediscussions in question should have been considered unimportant, especiallyin view of first sentence of your third paragraph.* See (17). f See (18).[23155] d
is&quot; 2. The most important of the decisions of His Majesty&apos;s Government,of which you inform me, are those in paragraphs 7 and 10. I understand from these that it is the considered policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government:(a) not to formulate further details of peace objectives even for discussionwith their allies more definitely than is done in the Atlantic Charter; (b) tooffer continued collaboration with the Soviet Government after the war &quot; forthe purpose of working out terms of a new settlement of Europe,&quot; but at thesame time to avoid for the present any negotiations with them about sucha settlement, and furthermore to avoid even an undertaking which would commit us to embarking on such negotiations at an early date.&quot; 3. Meanwhile, you suggest that my services will be of value in preparing the ground so that negotiations can be undertaken with everyprospect of success at the appropriate moment.&quot;4. I do not think that an offer of future collaboration as in second paragraph (a) above, with the proviso that for the present His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are not prepared to do anything more about it, is likely toprepare the ground for anything except worse relations and failure. In anycase, I find it difficult to know how I am to prepare the ground in a hardfrost without any implements.&quot;5. Taking seriatim points in Stalin-Beaverbrook discussions which you have followed up, you will observe : (a) was dealt with by a directmessage to Stalin, as to which please see my telegram No. 68, paragraph 13;(b) is apparently not thought to require a follow-up; (c) is apparently being settled in London; (\cl) the same; (e) has been dealt with by me inparagraphs 2-4 above; (/) also apparently requires no follow-up; (g) has beenalso dealt with in London; (h) I have dealt with in paragraphs 2-4 above;(i) is under consideration.&quot; 6. You will thus see that it is unnecessary for me to do anything atthis end about any of these matters. I am not in the least criticising yourmethod of dealing with them which may well be the best under the circum-stances.  I merely record the fact that I can do nothing to help.&quot;7. As it is not possible for me to get any further with the agreements for the future or for reasons given above-with preparatory discussions,and as you know my very strong view that if we wait we shall find that difficulties will grow as the situation here improves (that is, on theassumption that we are going to win the war, which is the only assumptionworth making), you will, I am sure, appreciate the view which I havealready expressed, and which I now repeat, that it is no use my staying here and doing nothing.&quot; 8. I came here to do a special job and not  IS cl professionaldiplomatist, and it was understood that when the job was at an end I should leave. Owing to the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the job is now atan end and there is nothing more that I can do.&quot;9. I welcome sincerely the prospect which you hold out in yourtelegram No. 122, t but this offers only a vague possibility, and I am anywaycertain that you would be fully capable of doing whatever His Majesty&apos;sGovernment want done without my being here, so that it is not worth mywhile to wait on the very off-chance of this coming off in the near futureunless you indicate that this is what is meant by your telegram.&quot;10. I tried, and I hope succeeded, in making it quite clear in my lasttelegram (68)1 tnat I could not stay here unless I could do something of usein winning the war. Your telegram makes no suggestion of anything thatI could do beyond that in the last sentence of paragraph 10; and, as statedin paragraphs 2 to 4 above, there is nothing that I can in fact do in thismatter in view of His Majesty&apos;s Governments decisions (a) and (&amp;), whichI deplore and which you know are contrary to all the advice I have given.&quot;11. Since [group undecypherable] the above I have received a copyof Stalin&apos;s message to the Prime Minister, as to which see my immediately following telegram.&quot;f See (18).$See (14).
(21)Sir S. Cripps to Mr. Eden.(No. 99.   Immediate.   Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Kuibyshev, November 13, 1941.Vyshinski to-day read to me the text, which he had received by telephone from moscow, of Stalin&apos;s reply to the Prime Ministers last message, which I gatherhas been telegraphed direct to the Soviet Ambassador.2. Reply seems to me to emphasise the two difficulties which I have alreadystressed in earlier telegrams. It confirms in particular my views as expressed inmy immediately preceding telegram (which was drafted before I saw Vyshinski);and the only two courses which I can now suggest for clarifying the situationare : (a) That you and Chiefs of Staff should come here immediately to discuss it with Stalin; or(b) that I should be given sufficiently detailed instructions to be able todiscuss it myself.Neither of these courses would, however, be or any value unless His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were prepared to modify their policy, as explained in your telegramNo. 121*3. Vyshinski added that Molotov and Stalin would be glad to see me in moscow any time I liked, and would make all the arrangements for me to getthere.  But this is of no use unless there is some constructive policy to put forward.* See (17):(22)Mr. Eden to Sir S. Cripps (Kuibyshev).(No. 139.   Immediate.   Personal.)(Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, November 13, 1941.I asked the Soviet Ambassador to come to see me on 12th November, when I told him that M. Stalin&apos;s reply to the Prime Ministers message had been underconsideration by the Cabinet, and I had been instructed to give his excellency the following reply : &quot; M. Stalin&apos;s message is being considered. I am not at present in aposition to give your Excellency any reply to it, as it raises such very largeissues. At the same time I cannot conceal from you that the Prime Ministerand the Cabinet were surprised and pained at the tone and the contents ofthe message.&quot;As regards the last portion of the message, which dealt with supplies, I under-stood the ambassador had already seen Lord Beaverbrook, who had been painedat the fact that this part of the communication had not been sent to him since he wa,s handling the matter. I understood, however, that M. Maisky had alreadyseen Lord Beaverbrook.  M. Maisky said this was so.2    Some further discussion ensued, which I need not report in detail.3. M. Stalin&apos;s message betrays a mood which we must do our best totransform, but we feel that for the moment any reply, whether argumentative orapologetic, would only make matters worse. A few days for reflection on bothsides may be all to the good.(23)Sir S. Cripps to Mr. Eden.(No. 109.  Most Immediate.   Personal and Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Kuibyshev, November 15, 1941.Your telegram No. 139.*I feel bound to warn you that, in my opinion, a pause for reflection is unlikely to make the smallest change in Stalin&apos;s attitude. His reply was not couched indiplomatic language, but there was not the slightest reason to expect that it* See (22). .[23155] e
would be.   He is by habit frank and blunt in his speech, and has never had any real contact with Western ways and diplomatic usages.2. As I have more than once pointed out, there is a long and unfortunatehistory of bad relationship between the two countries leading up to the presenttime. This, added to the Eussian Georgian suspicion of Western european countries, does, in fact; predispose Stalin (and Molotov) excessively suspicious of our motives. In result all we do and say is most easily misconstrued. Thisis a basic fact and it cannot be disregarded or brushed aside.3. Stalin is not convinced thai we are in this war with the Russianswholeheartedly and without reservations. He has his own ideas as to tests whichwill convince him one way or the other or will predispose him to such ultimateconviction. These he has stated as his two conditions with complete franknessin his last message. Form of the statement is typically Stalinesque, and he is unlikely to change that manner of stating his views.4. In spite of frequent warning, His Majesty&apos;s Government have so farappeared to overlook the fundamental importance of the issues, which Stalinregards as touchstones of their sincerity in all-in collaboration not only duringthe war when the Russian army is clearly an asset of inestimable value to us,but after the war, when our sympathetic collaboration with Russia may be thoughtby some to be more advantageous to the Soviet Government than to us.5. The longer this state of uncertainty continues in his mind, the more willStalin be ready to believe and I do not doubt some of those around him (includingpossibly Molotov) will emphasise the point to him that we are not prepared togo in whole-heartedly with Russia on his terms, but that our only object is tokeep her fighting the Germans as long as we can.6. It seems to me that the time has come when His Majesty&apos;s government can hardly avoid giving a clear answer on the two points raised by Stalin.Temporisation and delay will not, in my view, improve matters, nor will softwords of praise.7. I have no doubt that, whatever His Majesty&apos;s Government do in theway of turning these points down, if they do turn them down, Stalin will continueto accept everything that he can get from us and he will not, of course, do anything to break off relations, but collaboration in the true sense of the wordwill not exist and we shall continue to fight two substantially different wars.- 8: As to his remarks about Generals Wavell and Paget, these are perfectlyunderstandable in his present frame of mind. Appointments of both these officers are to the East, and neither would, I gather, be returning to London. Moreover,in view of General Wavell&apos;s post and what has already passed between him and russians in the abortive meeting at. Tiflis, I am not surprised that Stalin doesnot regard him and General Paget as the right persons with whom he should discuss points that he raises and which are the only fundamental points thathe is now interested in discussing. No doubt, too, he thinks that they mightmerely renew the suggestions, already made and turned down by his [group undecypherable : ? Military Mission] as to replacing- of Soviet troops in iran and the sending of some British units into the Caucasus.9. You will remember that I promised them a definite answer, now over three weeks.ago, on the question of military help and so far no such answer hasbeen given or promised by His Majesty&apos;s Government. This delay greatly addsto their suspicions, associated unfortunately with the continued lack ofexplanation and of collaboration in planning of the future of what should, intheir view, be a single war against Hitler. The simple explanation which mighthave satisfied them six weeks ago will obviously not do so now.10.   As regards the question of declarjliori^f^w^ and othercountries, there is no doubt that most sensitive point is as regards Finland. Wewere all amazed here when we heard this matter disclosed on the B.B.C. and in american Press, especially as regards the Soviet offer to make peace. Followingas it does upon a whole series of similar incidents, as to which you will findnumerous records in my telegrams over last 17 months, I am not surprisedat Stalin&apos;s exasperation. I have frequently explained that the Soviet government regard the B.B.C. as official mouth-piece of His Majesty&apos;s Government, whatever the facts may be. Stalin and his colleagues can never be made to credit the need of such publicity in a matter which directly concerns them and as to the publishing-of which they have never been consulted. In their view, in critical times such asthe present, diplomatic secrets should be kept closely guarded as military secrets.
11. You yourself expressed the view that refusal to declare war on Finlandby His Majesty&apos;s Government, as suggested in Prime Minister&apos;s message of-6th September, &quot; might arouse their latent suspicion as to our motives &quot; (seeyour telegram No. 5847* to Washington); it seems clear now that you were right and that it has done so.12. As to reference to supply difficulties, this seems perfectly natural inview of Prime Minister&apos;s reference to the same matter in his message. Stalinreacts quite naturally to implied suggestion that Soviet Government are not making, or cannot make, the best use of material supplied. He does not dealwith the failure of the Soviet Staff to collaborate with Military Mission, as thisis bound up in his mind with the sceond of his two points of fundamental importance.Above is an attempt to explain state of mind which I believe to be behindStalin&apos;s message. My suggestions as to how it should be dealt with are containedin my immediately following telegram&apos;.* Not printed.(24)Sir S. Cripps to Mr. Eden.(No. 110.  Most Immediate.   Personal and Secret.)(Telegraphic.) Kuibyshev, November 15, 1941.My immediately preceding telegram.I am anxious not to be repetitive of what I said in earlier telegrams, but i hope that it is not too late for His Majesty&apos;s Government to reconsider theirpolicy on this matter, as I feel that the present is the most critical moment inour relationship and that action taken now will go far to determine the wholecourse of those relations during and after the war.2. We must, in my opinion, either agree to discussions that Stalin asks for or else convince him that there is some perfectly valid reason, other than ourunwillingness to collaborate, why we should not do so. I am not myself aware of any such reason to refuse the discussions, though there may be many reasons why we cannot assent to particular things which he may ask in the course of discussions.3. If we regard it as important to get a better degree of collaboration, asI dp myself, then I think we must make up our minds to (a) treat the Russiansas in every way an equal and as important as Greece or Turkey from the pointof view of discussion and the personnel we send to conduct the discussions. Onthis latter point they are, as I am sure you fully realise, extremely sensitive.(b) Discuss with them the question of post-war collaboration. I understand thatwe are prepared to undertake such collaboration, (c) Enter into staff collaborationto plan mutually the future conduct of the war on the basis of a really frank and comprehensive basis.4. If, as the Russians seem to think not unlikely, the front is shortlystabilised here, the Germans will be in a position to withdraw some of their troops to other theatres of war and it may then become a matter- of vitalimportance for us to be able to revitalise the Russian front in order to draw offthe German forces from other fronts. If present atmosphere of non-collaborationpersists till that time, then they may well take up the attitude that, regretfully,they can do nothing to help as they are too busily engaged upon their own war,and we may suffer seriously as a result.5. For this as well as the [group undecypherable : ? necessarily] [group undecypherable : ? mutual] reason of successful prosecution of the defeat of hitler and the making of a sound peace after victory, it is worth while, in myopinion, a hundred times to do our utmost even to the extent of revising our policy in order to take this, perhaps the last, good opportunity of getting fullcollaboration with this country.
