E. BRIDGES.Great George Street, S.W. 1,October 19, 1941.THE SECURITY EXECUTIVE.The Communist Party of Great Britain.THE annexed Memorandum has been prepared by the Security Executive,because they felt there should be a considered answer to the question : &quot; Howfar should the Communist Party&apos;s professed support of national unity and thenational effort be accepted at its face value.&quot; The facts set out in the Papershow that the revolutionary aims of the Party are unchanged, but that they haveseized on the gallant resistance of Russia as an opportunity to appear as popularadvocates of increased, production, while developing a skilful technique forundermining both works management and Trade Union organisation and authority.In preparing this Paper care has been taken only to use published materialor information coining from secret sources, which are unimpeachable or havebeen proved to be reliable.Paragraphs 4 to 11 set out the attitude and tactics adopted by the CommunistParty from the outbreak of war to the attack on Russia. After the volte faceexecuted by the Party, under orders from Moscow at the end of September 1939,the attitude of the Party was consistently obstructive and defeatist. The war was an imperialist war. Speeches and publications continued to be as hostile to the present national Government as they had been to its predecessor. efforts to increase production were obstructed. Industrial unrest was fomented.Grievances real or manufactured were exploited in industry, in the army, and among the general public. The constitutional position of Trade Unions wasundermined by the Shop Stewards movement in factories and by the engineering and Allied Trades Shop Stewards National Council.   Active steps were takenT23029] b
to create or infiltrate a number of organisations, as a means of enlisting support from non-Communists, and to afford cover for Communist activities.The entry of Russia into the war gave the Party the opportunity to escaoefrom its unpopular and defeatist line; to state that the character of the war had changed; and to come out as champions of increased production. To theseprofessions, they added demands such as the removal of friends of Fascismin the Government and high places, the public trial of Hess, the provision of deep shelters, and the elimination of corruption and waste in industry.At the same time it was explained in secret to Party members that the basicaims and long-term strategy of the Party were unchanged, but that the immediatetactics must be altered to utilise the present situation to the full. They mustconvince the Government of the genuineness of their support; and nothing mustbe said to imply that this was a short-term policy and that the long-term aimswere unchanged (see paragraph 15).A new technique was adopted in factories. In place of the former policyof attacks on management the Party was directed to work for joint committees of workers and managements. But again it was explained in secret that the objectof this policy was to gain control and undermine the managements from within(see paragraph 16).Attempts were to be made to hold meetings in Government establishments and factories, ostensibly to stimulate production. The policy of undermining theTrade Unions by Shop Stewards and the Shop Stewards National Council wasintensified, and keen efforts were and are being made to obtain recognition forthis system of dual unionism.Increased use has been made of apparently non-Communist bodies; and newbodies of this kind are being formed, &quot;Aid to Russia&quot; serving as an excellentmedium of propaganda and camouflage.It was expected that acute criticism and open hostility to the Governmentwould be withheld, or kept within discreet bounds, for the time being. But&quot; World News and Views,&quot; the Party organ to which members have been instructedto look for guidance since the suppression of the &quot; Daily Worker,&quot; has recentlybecome mischievous and hostile. I would draw particular attention to the attack by Pollitt on the Prime Minister and other Ministers, and on Government policy,which is quoted in paragraph 22.The Paper contains detailed proof of the facts summarised above. It isclear that the Communist game is still the same; but it is being played on amuch better wicket.(Signed) SWINTON.October 2, 1941.ANNEX.Policy and Tactics.1. A careful study of the history of the Communist movement both here and abroad shows that, whatever surface changes there may be in tactics, thefundamental concept, which never changes, is the revolutionary overthrow ofcapitalism. This is one of the basic themes of all Communist classics from Marxonwards. Stalin himself in his book on Leninism, the most recent edition ofwhich appeared since the outbreak of the present war, quotes Lenin&apos;s own words:&quot; The liberation of the oppressed class is impossible, not only without a violentrevolution, but also without the destruction of the apparatus of State power which was created by the ruling class.&quot; So long as this remains an axiom mCommunist teaching, it is clear that the Third International to which theCommunist Party of Great Britain is affiliated, cannot exist without thisrevolutionary aim.
2. The surface changes in tactics are nevertheless such particularly in atime of &quot; Popular Front&quot; like the present that it is easy to lose sight of the underlying continuity of plan. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance thatthe Government should be in a position to appraise rightly the policy, aims and methods of the Communist Party now and in the future.Changing Methods.3. In the twenty-two years of its existence the Third International hasemployed various means of approaching its goal of revolution. Its two mainmethods have been to attack from outside when the Party has been in openopposition to all established authority, and to penetrate from within in times when Popular Front tactics have been in operation. These lines of approachhave been laid down by Moscow from time to time and have in general beenuniversal directions applying to all national Communist Parties affiliated to theThird International. A very obvious example of this was the speech of Dimitrovat the 7th World Congress of the Communist International held in Moscow in1935 at which he launched the programme of the Popular Front. The PopularFront campaign failed to prosper in this country and consequently five leading members of the Communist Party of Great Britain Pollitt, Dutt, Gallacher,Kerrigan and Stewart were summoned to Moscow in August 1937 where theParty&apos;s methods were thoroughly overhauled. In addition to this comparativelyopen control of the broad lines of policy, information from most secret sourceshas revealed, during the periods in which it has been available, the completesubservience of the Communist Party of Great Britain to Moscow even in mattersof merely domestic importance.Britain at War.The Outbreak of War.4. The Communist Party had represented itself for so long as the onlyconsistent opponent of Fascism that it was not surprising that Harry Pollittand the Party generally should have been carried away into.support of the war against Germany when it broke out in September 1939. Even so the Party&apos;sopposition to the Chamberlain Government had been so strong that it was feltnecessary to qualify this support, and the Party declared that they were fightinga war on two fronts against Hitler abroad and against the &quot; pro-FascistChamberlain government &quot; at home.Comintern Instructions.5. The Executive Committee of the Communist International in Moscowsaw the fallacy of this line; and both Dimitrov, the Secretary-General, andAndre Marty, a member of the Executive, laid down the correct procedure toa leading member of the British Communist Party who happened to be in Moscowat the time. These verbal instructions were followed by peremptory writtenorders from Moscow to the British Party, copies of which have come into the possession of the investigating authorities. These instructions reached theCommunist Party in this country in the last days of September 1939, and readin part: &quot; The present war is an imperialist and unjust war for which thebourgeoisie of all the belligerent States bear equal responsibility.   In no country can the working class or the Communist Part)&apos; support the war.....   TheCommunist Parties which acted contrary to these tactics must now immediatelycorrect their policy.&quot;6. As a result of these instructions, the British Communist Party madeits first, volte face, and issued on the 7th October a new Manifesto saying thatits original appreciation of the war had been entirely wrong. From this moment the Party followed the policy of revolutionary defeatism, which by Lenin&apos;sdefinition carried, with it the duty that every revolutionary party of the working-class in all the belligerent countries should work for the defeat of its ownimperialist Government. The aim of this policy was so to weaken eachimperialist&quot; Government that it would be faced with the alternatives of accepting defeat at the hands of its &quot; imperialist &quot; opponent, or resigning andhanding over power to a &quot; Workers&apos; Government,&quot; which in the Communist view would be synonymous with the Communist Party.[23029]
A attack on Government.7.   The technique followed by the Communist Party here was to launch ageneral attack upon the Government, and all authority through all papers__such as the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; &quot; World News and Views,&quot; &quot; Challenge,&quot; &quot;TheLabour Monthly,&quot; &quot; The New Propellor,&quot; &amp;c. under its control. Pamphlets andleaflets were directed to the same purpose, as were the addresses of Party speakerswhose material is regularly supplied to them from Party headquarters in the formof speakers&apos; notes. These attacks were maintained just as actively against thepresent National Government as against its predecessor.Industrial Unrest.8. This general campaign was designed to spread dissatisfaction anddistrust of the Government, and served as a basis for the more direct attack uponproduction in the factories. Here the Party representatives within the trades union set themselves up as the champions of the workers&apos; rights, which had beenwon after years of struggle, and Avere about to be betrayed by Trades union leaders, who had sold themselves to the Government. In effect this policy resultedin the opposition to every attempt to increase production by working overtime,by dilution, or by any innovation which might appear to be an alteration of previous Trades Union procedure. Every petty grievance was magnified intoa major wrong, and every attempt at conciliation was opposed. One Party leadereven stated that there was not a factory in which there was no grievance, andthere was not a grievance which could not be turned into a strike.Shop Stetvards.9. The Communist Party had realised for a number of years that the most effective method of penetrating industry was through the Shop Stewards. TheParty, therefore, set out to establish its industrial members as Shop Stewards,and as a result the Communist representation among Shop Stewards is out of all proportion to the total number of Communists in industry. In order to make full use of its hold upon the Shop Stewards Movement the Communist Partyformed a body named the Engineering and Allied Trades Shop Stewards national council, which is entirely under Communist control, the chief organiser being a prominent Party member, Peter Zinkin, who is also editor of the Councikspaper, the &quot; New Propellor.&quot; This Shop Stewards National Council directs notonly the Party members but many other extremists amongst Shop Stewards in industry. Through this body the Party has created for the Shop Stewards anew function as leaders of the rank and file of Trades Unionists in matters outsidethe immediate problems of their shop, and in this way hopes to bring it about that Trades Union members will look for leadership to the Shop Stewards, andthus to the Communist Party, and not to the Trades Union leaders. This policyof &quot; dual unionism &quot; is designed in effect to establish a parasite political unionwithin the present Trades Union structure.Exploitation of Grievances.10. Though much of the Party&apos;s energy was devoted to making trouble in industry, it was also prepared to exploit any other grievance, which would meet with popular support. It was with this aim in view that the Party started itscampaigns for deep shelters, increased pensions, equal food distribution, betterArmy pay, and, in particular, the mischievous campaign against the use ofsoldiers for clearing away air raid debris. In this instance the Party represented that the soldiers, many of whom were good Trades Unionists, were acting asblacklegs and were robbing their fellow Trade Unionists of their proper workand their proper wages. They also put forAvard a demand to &quot; arm the workersin the factories,&quot; Avhich was probably designed to encourage class bitterness byluring the Government into some hasty statement that the workers could not be trusted with arms.Subsidiary Bodies.11. The technique of penetration carried on in industry through theEngineering and Allied Trades Shop Stewards National Council has long beenpractised by the Communist Party in other spheres. They have established secretgroups of Party members amongst journalists and such other professional workers
as doctors and lawyers, and they have set up or gained control of a number of bodies which operate without any direct connection with the Communist Party.Such bodies established by the Party include the Labour Research Department,the Russia To-day Society, the Society for Cultural Relations with the soviet union, the National Council for Civil Liberties and various organisations suchas the Tenants&apos; Defence Leagues, Peoples&apos; Vigilance Committees, A.R.P.Co-ordinating Committees and Shelter Committees, which have sprung up withCommunist encouragement all over the country. Party members have also beenur^ed to obtain positions upon such bodies as Trades Councils, while professionalmembers have established groups in the Haldane Society, on the legal side, andhave obtained a measure of control of such bodies as the Association of Architects,Surveyors and Technical Assistants. Many of those who have followed the leadof the Communist Party in these bodies are not themselves Party members andwould certainly not subscribe to the full revolutionary programme of the Party.They are, nevertheless, sympathetic towards various items in the Party&apos;programme and are regarded by the Party not only as possible recruits, but as aprotective cover if the Government should move against the Party. The Peoples&apos;Convention, held in January 1941, is the greatest example of the organisationof support for the Communist Party largely from non-Party sources.Russia at War.A &quot; People&apos;s War.&quot;12. The attack by Hitler upon the Soviet Union found the CommunistParty of Great Britain unprepared. The inclination of the leaders at first wasto see in this new aggression the consequence of the Hess visit, and to prophesythat the British Government would &apos;&apos; switch the war &quot; and join with Hitler inthe attack upon the Soviet Union. Mr. Churchill&apos;s promise of aid for the soviet union gave these leaders cause for thought, and Stalin&apos;s warm welcome to thispromise in his speech on the 3rd July acted as a clear instruction to communists in this country and elsewhere that the policy of the Communist Parties must nowchange, and that all Parties must campaign for the maximum aid to the SocialistFatherland. The Communists, therefore, . proclaimed that the war had now become a genuine people&apos;s war, and that it was their duty to see that Governmentinefficiency, or &quot; friends of Fascism &quot; in the Government, did not deprive theSoviet Union of the maximum aid which she had demanded and must receive.New Technique.13. Even this apparent co-operation in the war effort did not prevent theCommunist Party from making mischievous suggestions that there were pro-Fascist reactionaries in high places, who were more anxious to see the downfallof the Soviet Union than the defeat of Hitler. The Party demanded the publictrial of Hess and the publication of alleged recent secret negotiations. Itcontinued its agitation for deep shelters and better provisions for A.R.P., and itattacked the corruption, waste and disorganisation in industry.14. This last point is of interest as an example of its new technique ofpenetration from within in the place of attack from outside. Previously manage-ments had been represented as grasping capitalists interested only in obtainingfrom their men maximum output at minimum wages in the interests of profit.The Communist Party had, therefore, opposed the managements, and had repre-sented themselves to be the champions of the workers. Since the attack on Russia,managements are represented to be delaying production owing to their inefficiencyand thus to be robbing the Soviet Union of the assistance which she needs. TheLondon Shop Stewards&apos; Conference on production held on the 23rd August thisyear under the presidency of a well known Communist. Joe Goss, produced a very clear illustration of this tendency, for Goss in his opening address said : &quot;A few employers were guilty, not only through their inefficiency andtheir desire to accumulate profits, but by virtue of their hatred of the soviet union and their admiration of Hitler&apos;s methods of dealing with the working-class, of deliberately sabotaging the greatest possible output.&quot;The Communist Party has already called for the establishment of productioncommittees, which will be in the control of the shop stewards and will thuseliminate not only managements but also the present Trades Union organisation.
Basic Aims Unchanged.15. Information received from most secret sources, which have provedreliable in the past, reveals that various leaders of the Communist Party havestated that the basic aims of the Party are still revolutionary. &apos;&apos; The Party must at all times strive towards such means and such activities as will best prepare theway for revolution.&quot; Another Party leader addressing a secret meeting of localParty representatives said : &quot; The basic aims and long-term strategy of the Partyare unchanged, but the immediate tactics must be altered to utilise the presentsituation to the full. . . . The Communists have no illusions that ChurchhTsaims and theirs are likely to coincide for long, but meanwhile he is putting theirpolicy in force and they must pretend to back him up completely they do backhim in support for Russia. ... If the Communists rally popular support forthis, when the times comes and Churchill and Eden want to alter their policy,popular opinion will be too strong to allow it. . . . They must convince theBritish Government of the genuineness of their support, so nothing must be saidto imply that this is a short-term policy and that their long-term aims are not changed. This is one of the reasons for our giving such publicity to having&apos; changed the line &apos;.&quot;Attacks on Management.16.   Yet another Party leader admitted that accusations of &quot; ca&apos;canny &quot; andabsenteeism against Communist workers had been true in the past &apos;&apos; when theParty line was not to help the national effort.&quot;   This must be changed now as itwas essential that managements should not be able to blame faults of productionupon the workers.   He continued: &quot;In the past the Communist Party hasattacked and opposed the managements.   Now they want joint committees with,the workers and managements.  They believe they can more effectively gain controland undermine the managements from within once they have achieved joint;committees. . . .   The Party did mean to try to speed up production, but at thejsanie time they mean to use the campaign also to undermine the managements-I discrediting the managements and achieving additional administrative power for&apos; the workers.&quot;17. The admission that &quot; ca&apos;canny &quot; methods had been used in the past wasopenly confirmed by a shop steward speaking at the recent London Shop StewardsConference. According to the report in the Communist paper &quot; New Propellor,&quot;this man said : &quot; No longer can we say in the factory or section : &apos; automaticopposition to the gaffer &apos; (foreman). That&apos;s out. We want increased production.&quot;Here we have a shop steward who, according to the Communist Party, is a responsible representative of the workers, admitting that he has automaticallyopposed authority, and has only attempted to obtain increased production after his country has been at war for almost two years.Factory Meetings.18. The Communist Party^ has devoted itself energetically to obtainingrecognition as a responsible leader of labour, engaged in furthering the war effort.It has, therefore, made a number of attempts to hold meetings in government establishments and factories, ostensibly to stimulate production. It is known that the Party attaches great importance to establishing itself in this way. It isprobably for this reason that the speeches actually delivered at the few meetings which have been held in works have been unexceptionable, because the Partyspeakers are anxious at the moment to establish their right to address these meetings. It is, nevertheless, known that Poilitt, following a meeting in whitehall, expressed scornful astonishment that the authorities were so blind asto allow laim to speak, and this suggests that the Party itself intends that thepresent innocuOus-phase should only be a temporary one. It will be shown later that the Communist press is already attacking the Government, and it is reason-able to assume that, if the Party is once allowed to establish that its members mayaddress factory meetings, their speeches will soon follow suit.Undermining Trades Unions.19. These new and more subtle methods of attack have been intensified alsoin the case of the Trades Unions. The Communist Party has continued to givethe greatest publicity to the work of the Shop Stewards not only as the champions
f the workers&apos; rights, but also as the leaders in the drive for increased production.In this latter capacity the Engineering and Allied Trades Shop StewardsNational Council has recently appeared as an independent leader of labour, andis thus a direct threat to the authority of the Trades Union Congress itself.   Atvioical example of this occurred recently, when a request was addressed by amember of the Select Committee on National Expenditure to W. Swanson,.convenor of Shop Stewards at Napiers, to furnish evidence of delays in production.Swanson is a member of the Communist Party and Vice-CTIairman of &apos; the&quot;T3hop iStewards National Council.   The Council seized the opportunity of taking this:request as addressed to itself.   This has caused considerable jubilation in the offices of the Council, where it is felt that this to some extent offsets the refusal of the Trades Union Congress to grant affiliation or have any dealings withthe Council. .Subsidiary Bodies.20. Similar attempts to obtain official recognition have been made in thecase of other subsidiary organisations of the Communist Party. A new venture,called the Anglo-Soviet Youth Friendship Committee, has also been launchedunder the control of an astute secret member of the Young Communist League,who is also responsible for the Communist inspired International Youth Rally,to be held in the Albert Hall on the 11th October. This Rally has alreadyattracted some popular and official support.21. Apart from this the Popular Front has not given rise to any great number of new bodies, but there has been an intensified use of those apparentlynon-Communist organisations over which the Party nevertheless exercises control.The Russia To-day Society has shown greatly increased activity and Sovietexhibitions and Anglo-Soviet committees under Communist direction are being organised in many parts of the country.Press A attacks.22. While the Party speakers and organisers are still moving carefully inofficial contacts, the Communist press is already beginning to come out into the open in its new attempts to discredit the Government. This is well illustrated by the following quotation from a recent issue of &quot; World News and Views&quot; towhich members of the Party were instructed to look for guidance on matters ofpolicy after the suppression of the &quot; Daily Worker&quot; : &quot; Mr. Churchill&apos;s statement of policy made on the 9th Septembercompletely failed to satisfy public disquiet. . . . The biggest and mostalarming fact that emerged, a fact that will undoubtedly encourage Hitler,is that the organisation of a Second Front is not contemplated at this stage.&quot; Taken in conjunction with the statements of Lord Moyne andMr. Attlee on behalf of the Government, we have here a declaration of adefinite policy which can be summed up as limited assistance to Russia,rejection of military action, &apos; ceaseless study of the whole problem &apos; aftertwelve weeks of the most bloody battles of history continued postponement of any announcement of a date for the Three-Power Conference, and waiting until next year.&quot;It is in this context that Colonel Moore-Brabazon&apos;s statement takeson the greatest importance. It becomes, not an isolated episode or&apos; indiscretion,&apos; but a test of Government policy. The fact that his state-ment was not repudiated emphasises that what Moore-Brabazon said, and what the Government explained as its policy, may have been differentlyphrased, but from the point of view of practical effect they were not very far removed.&quot;It is of interest to note that this extract is taken from the report of a speech ofHarry Pollitt, who, when speaking with another voice, has been accepted as awnole-hearted and valuable ally in the war effort.Escape from Difficulties.23. Throughout the period of revolutionary defeatism the Communist party of Great Britain applied the instructions laid down by Lenin for the last warso slavishly that they did not realise that the Russian situation then and the
British situation in this war were not analogous. As a result the Party had tomeet a great deal of criticism both from its own members and from possiblesupporters, who saw clearly that its policy was defeatist, even if they failed torealise the full implications of revolutionary defeatism.24. The attack by Hitler upon the Soviet Union enabled the CommunistParty to escape from the embarrassing situation into which revolutionarydefeatism had landed them, and to carry on their revolutionary activities undera banner of increased production and resistance to Hitler. From this point off, view the Communist menace may be considered even more dangerous now than inI the past because so many more people are likely to be attracted by its presentpopular front policy, which the Party itself represents as the only method ofobtaining a quick and successful end to the war.25. This new line is, however, a change in tactics only, and not in the basicrevolutionary policy, as has been already pointed out in the secret reports quoted in paragraphs 15, 16 and 17. The aim and technique remain the same, but the communists are now operating in conditions much more favourable to the Party.The Present Programme.26.   The Party&apos;s present programme can briefly be summarised as follows : (1) The winning of mass support and recognition by specious offers ofco-operation in the war effort.(2) The attack on the Government for failing to meet the irresponsibledemands foisted upon the public by the Party&apos;s publicity machine.(3) The attack on management, skilfully camouflaged under the demand for production Committees.(4) The undermining of established Trades Unions by Shop Stewardsarrogating to themselves functions independent of the Unions, andby the creation of the parallel organisation, the Shop StewardsNational Council.(5) The exploitation of other bodies, either captured or created by the Party,to spread Communist teaching and win new adherents.27. In this appreciation the endeavour has been made only to use publishedmaterial or information coming from secret sources, which are unimpeachable or have been proved to be reliable in the past. It is in the light of these facts that policy should be determined.
