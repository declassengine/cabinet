TO BE KEPT UNOtfl        AND KEYensure the secrecy of this doouflwtt,ItHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. )SECRET.W.p;(4l) 289.26TH SEPTEMBER,  1941.COPY NO.WAR CABINETPOLITICAL MEETINGS IN FACTORIES.Memorandum &quot;by the Lord President of the Council.1. Mr. Harry Pollitt, who has recently abandoned his work asa boilermaker in order to devote his full time to political activities as Secretary of the Communist Party,  is planning tohold a series of lunch-hour meetings at war production factories and similar establishments, with a view to impressing upon theworkers the need for increased production.Application has teen made for leave to hold such meetings in the Port of London and at the Royal OrdnanceFactory at Bridgend.    Meetings have actually &quot;been held atfactories under private management.    Arrangements had also &quot;beenmade for Mr. Pollitt to hold a meeting on the 11th Septemberin the Central Court of the Air Ministry Building, Whitehall,to address workers engaged on the construction of heavily-protected accommodation in that building: but leave to hold thismeeting inside the building was refused,  on the ground that political meetings could not be allowed in Government offices,and the meeting took place outside the gates in Great george street.2. On the occasions when he has spoken,  there has beennothing in Mr. Pollitt&apos;s speeches to which exception could betaken.    The line taken at present by him and other leaders ofthe Communist Party is to give full support to the policy ofthe Government in providing aid for Russia, and he has devotedhis speeches to an appeal for increased, production and a defence of the policy of the Communist Party.It is likely that he would pursue this line in futurespeeches,  at any rate for a time.    It is known, however,  that,although the present tactics of the Communist Party are tosupport the Government in the prosecution of the war,  their ultimate revolutionary aim has not been changed.    The Party&apos;f&quot; hope-to be able to exploit their present tactical support of&apos;w the war effort in order to recover lost ground and so put themselves in a stronger position, when the time comes,  to achieve their revolutionary objectives.It is, moreover,   the aim of the Communist Party to undermine the authority of the Trade Unions.    The Trade union movement is already alarmed at the extent to which some of theUnions have been penetrated by Communist elements:  and this danger would be substantially increased if Communist leaders were allowed to appe al to the workers for increased productionwith any appearance of official permission or approval.

3* The Home Defence (Security) Executive have consideredthe position and have submitted the following recommendations:-(a) That it &quot;be made a definite policy that no politicalmeetings of any kind shall be held in government offices or in factories or other establishmentsdirectly under Government control;  and(b) That, as regards factories under private management^&apos;the Trade Union Congress and the British Employers&apos;-...&apos;Federation should be informed of this decision.    &quot;\4. If this rule is adopted;  it will be important to avoid giving the impression that it is aimed solely at Mr,  pollit^tand the leaders of the Communist Party,    It is not suggestedthat there should be any interference with the practice by which members of the Fighting Services are invited to visit war production factories; for these meetings could not be regardedas &quot;political&quot;,,    It will, however, be necessary for the supply departments and the Ministry of Information to exercise great care in arranging other types of meeting in factories.    The ruleagainst political meetings must be applied to all Parties alike;and Departments will have to refrain from arranging any meeting which could be represented as &quot;political&quot;  in character.5. The Minister of Labour and the Home Secretary concur inthe recommendations summarised in paragraphs 3 and 4 of. thismemorandum,I suggest that these recommendations be adopted by theWar Cabinet and that all Departments be instructed accordingly.(Intld. ) J. A.Great George Street,  3.17. 1.26th September,  1941,
