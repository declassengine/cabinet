(41) 205.November 10, 1941.Copy No.   2 to BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SUPPLIES TO TURKEY.Importance of Continuing Policy of Strengthening Turkey.Memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have committed themselves to sending consider-able supplies to the Soviet Union. We have accepted the sacrifices involved andour promises are now being fulfilled. I am anxious, however, lest in concentrating on the needs of the Soviet Union the importance of continuing our supplies- to turkey should be overlooked.2. The friendship of Turkey and her continued resistance to german pressure or blandishments are of crucial importance not only to our position inthe Near East, but also to the Soviet Union themselves. It must be our aim,first, to strengthen Turkey&apos;s will to resist, and, secondly, by increasing hercapacity to do so, to put her in a position where she can feel herself able to planwith us in advance joint defence measures to withstand a German attack.3. Turkey is dependent on us for both her civil and military supplies andwe cannot expect her to play the role for which we have cast her unless these supplies are maintained. If Turkey, as a result of Axis pressure, were to abandon the British connexion or allow the transit of German forces across her territory(either to attack us in the Middle East, or, more probable still, to turn the Russianflank), the blow to ourselves and the Russians would greatly outweigh the benefits to the Soviet Union of the small quantity of supplies she may have to forgo ifwe continue our deliveries of equipment to Turkey at the rate contemplated beforethe Moscow Conference. For instance, I understand that the Americans are preparing to send 10,000 lorries a month to the Soviet Union, an offer which hasmade it necessary for us to cancel the modest allocation of 110 lorries a month to Turkey.4. Nevertheless,, I. realise that in view of Russian requirements the time has come to clear our minds as to what we consider the essential minimum asregards war material to be sent to Turkey over and above what we are pledged to supply under the Treaty. (Most of these Treaty supplies are on the way to completion.) This paper is intended to give an estimate of this minimum and suggest how it should be supplied.Offer of British Units to Turkey in lieu of Specialised War Material.5. Highly secret discussions have been proceeding for some time as to theextent of our aid to Turkey in the event of a German attack.   The Turkish11546   [23132]
General Staff asked for considerable military assistance, for a number of bombers and fighters to expand their air force, and for tanks to bring the strength of theirone armoured brigade up to a division. Our response has been to offer the TurkishGeneral Staff to despatch 4 infantry and 2 armoured divisions, 2 army tankbrigades 12 squadrons of S.R. fighters, 7 squadrons of. medium bombers, 2squadrons of heavy bombers and 3 squadrons of army co-operation aircraft inthe event of a German attack in the spring, provided the situation developsfavourably as hoped and on the condition that Turkish communications provesufficient to enable this force to be maintained. In making the offer of our air squadrons we made it clear that we expected the Turks not to press their request for aircraft for themselves. We have, however, given no specific answer to their request for tanks.6 Meanwhile, it can be laid down as a general rule that, as the Turks arenot good at handling highly technical weapons, it is more profitable that suchtechnical weapons should be devoted to those of our specialised units which will eventually take part in the defence of Turkey, rather than that they should be handed over to the Turkish army. It seems desirable that this should be made clear to the Turks together with the fact that the provision by ourselves of armoured units must satisfy their request for tanks to equip their own projectedarmoured division.Type of War Material to be Supplied in Future to Turkey.7. Against this our specialised formations in the air and on the land willbe dependent on Turkish infantry support in the event of war spreading to turkey and our coming to her assistance, and will need to make use of Turkishaerodromes, communications and other facilities. It follows, therefore, in ourown interests that we should supply the Turkish army with the followingequipment, &amp;c.:  (a) Infantry equipment, e.g., rifles, machine guns, with ammunition, small arms generally and engineering stores, A/ T guns and field artillery.(b) Motor transport, which is one of the most serious of Turkish deficiencies,and the one we have done probably least to meet.(c) Adequate supply of raw materials for the Turkish military factories,which in many cases are the only sources of supply for Turkishammunition.(d) Maintenance by provision of instructors, workshops, &amp;c, of all specialisedequipment, e.g., A/A guns already supplied.Financing of Supply of War Material to Turkey both from the United Kingdomand the United States of America.8. The policy referred to in paragraph 6 above should apply whether the stores or materials are issued from United Kingdom or U.S.A. sources. Mostof the items required by the Turks from United States of America can best besupplied from our own existing contracts or deliveries under Lend-Lease. Therewill, however, be cases where Turkish needs should be covered by special Lend-Lease requisitions. Our Missions have not so far felt able to put in such requisi-tions (except in a few minor cases), because to do so would mean using fundsunder the Lend-Lease Appropriation which would otherwise be available for us.Meanwhile, the State Department have been pressing us to agree to direct Lend-Leasing to Turkey, and we have replied that we must control supply if we are tocontrol the general strategy of the war. Therefore, when the Turks have com-plamed, as they recently have, that they are getting nothing from the UnitedStates, the Americans have blamed us for not leaving room for Turkish needswhen entering Lend-Lease requisitions. To overcome this difficulty the most appropriate course would seem to be to reserve a definite sum from our share ofthe appropriation to cover an immediate and definite programme of requisitionsplaced specially for Turkey.
Conclusions.9.   I would recommend the following action : (i) It should be laid down as our definite policy of assistance to Turkeythat rather than providing specialised equipment to Turkish forma-tions we should provide the necessary formations ourselves, though some trickle of such weapons should continue in order to satisfyTurkish military pride. This principle should be clearly put to theTurks.  In order to gild the pill, however (ii) The Turkish General Staff should be informed that a special effort willbe made to supply a minimum programme of Turkish requirements for infantry equipment, engineering stores and mechanical transport as suggested in paragraph 7 above, by a given date of which the Turksshould be informed. The Allied Supply Executive should be instructedto give effect to this offer,(iii) Instructions should be given to the Supply Council in North america to reserve a sum of $50 million, which is the equivalent of 1 per cent,of the new appropriation available to us, to cover Turkish requisitionsin the United States of America.A.
