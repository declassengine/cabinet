THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1941./SECRET.W.P. (41) 267.November 14, 1941.Copy No.    2 to BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SHOULD DETENTION ORDERS BE MADE UNDER defence regulation 18b AGAINST CERTAIN PERSONS CARRYINGON PREJUDICIAL PROPAGANDA.IN connection with the powers of detention conferred on the Home secretary by Defence Regulation 18b, a question of principle has arisen on which I thinkit right to consult the War Cabinet.1. Under this Regulation before the Home Secretary can make an order of detention he must have reasonable cause to believe one or more of the followingthings : (a) that the suspect is of hostile origin or associations;(6) that he has been recently concerned in acts prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the realm; or(c) that he has been active in the furtherance of the objects of a dangerousorganisation which is covered by the provisions of paragraph (1a) ofthis Regulation.Most of the persons who have been detained under this Regulation arepersons connected with the British Union or persons of hostile origin orassociations. The few who have been detained as persons concerned in actsprejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the realm are believed to havedone things which, generally speaking, could be made the basis of criminalcharges if sufficient evidence could be adduced to provide the degree of proofneeded in a Court of law. The general principle which the Home Office followsis that, if the criminal proceedings can be taken, they should be taken, and that only if there are good reasons against a prosecution should use be made of thepower to detain by administrative order persons who are believed to be concernedin acts prejudicial. There are, however, cases where the information available,though sufficient to give the Home Secretary reasonable cause to believe that thesuspect has been concerned in some act prejudicial, is not sufficient to prove a criminal charge in a Court of law; and there are cases where there is some otherstrong reason against prosecution, such, for example, as the consideration thatthe giving of evidence in Court would destroy the value of some important secretagent. Amongst the persons who have been detained as being concerned in actsprejudicial are members of the I.R.A., persons who have obtained or tried toobtain secret information, persons who have tried or planned to get in touchwith the enemy, persons who have committed or planned acts of sabotage, personswho have tried to slow down production, and so on. All these persons are believedMemorandum by the Home Secretary.[23153]
rto have been guilty of committing or preparing to commit criminal offencesthough criminal proceedings are impracticable or for some substantial reasoninexpedient.2. The question has now arisen whether in certain special cases it is rightto use this power for detaining persons against whom nothing can be allegedexcept that they have made statements which, though not constituting criminal offences which might be made the subject of a prosecution, are highly prejudicial to the defence of the realm.If there is ground for believing that a person is of hostile origin or associa-tion, or that he has been concerned with the British Union, the fact that he hasmade prejudicial statements has frequently been treated as one of the factors tobe taken into account in deciding whether it is or is not necessary to detain him-but if all that can be alleged against an individual is that he has made statementsprejudicial to the defence of the realm or public safety, this fact by itself hasnot hitherto been regarded as a sufficient ground for a detention order.If, in addition to making prejudicial statements, a person is concerned inother prejudicial acts, such, for example, as an attempt to form some kind of organisation injurious to the defence of the realm or the public safety, or inattempts to obtain secret information, or in attempts or preparations to get intouch with the enemy, there is no question that it is a proper use of regulation 18b to make a detention order against such person. Is it also a proper use of the Regulation to make a detention order against a person whoseonly acts prejudicial consist in the advocacy of opinions of which the expressionthough highly prejudicial to the defence of the realm or the public safety, cannot,under the existing law, be made the basis of a criminal charge ?3. Any wide or indiscriminate use of the power of detention against personswho engage in propaganda which is, in the opinion of the Home Secretary,prejudicial to the war effort would provoke strong and wide-spread oppositionboth in Parliament and the Press. There are, however, certain forms of anti-warpropaganda which public opinion in general would recognise to be illegitimate,although they cannot be made the subject of criminal proceedings under theexisting law.At the present time I have under consideration of a man of someprominence, who has written leaflets and letters (some of them being privateletters, and some of them having been published in certain periodicals) advocatingviews of this character. He advocates a negotiated peace with Hitler, and inhis propaganda combines Pacifist opinions with defeatism and pro-Nazi opinions.He blames the Government for a policy which led to war; he finds excuses forHitler and refrains from any disapprobation of Nazi acts; he suggests that an allied victory is unlikely, and that a negotiated peace is the only way of savingthis country from ruin; and by contrasting the British economic systemunfavourably with the Nazi system he gives the reader the impression that a situation in which Nazi policy dominated Europe would produce advantagesdenied to us by the social and economic policy of our own Government.4. Propaganda of this kind is very different from the propaganda, howevermischievous, of those who say that all war is wrong, or of those who say thatthe present Government is incompetent and that large changes must be made inthe personnel of the Government and in the economic and social structure of thiscountry if the war is to be carried on successfully. Against propagandists whoare merely hostile to the Government or propagandists who are merely PacifistI should not think it right to use Regulation 18 b, but propaganda which has adefeatist and pro-Nazi character seems to me to stand on a different footing.5. The difficulties of using Regulation 18 b for the detention of personsagainst whom nothing can be alleged except the poisonous nature of theirpropaganda may be summarised as follows : i(a) If such persons are not engaging in any secret or conspiratorial actsbut are carrying on open propaganda with no attempt at concealment,there would be no difficulty of proving in a Court of law what theyhad done. It can therefore be urged that the proper way of dealingwith such activities is to render them illegal by means of a defence regulation and to prosecute those who contravene such a Regulation.
It may be said that expressions of opinion must either be lawful orunlawful; that if they are unlawful the speaker or writer shouldbe prosecuted, and if they are lawful he should not be detained by administrative order.(b) If Regulation 18 b is used against propagandists who express defeatistor pro-Nazi views, it will be evident that it might also be used againstpropagandists who express other views which, in the opinion of theHome Secretary of the day, are prejudicial to the public safety orthe defence of the realm. Although in practice I should only use thepower against individuals whose views would be condemned by publicopinion in general, the objection may be raised that, if one person canbe locked up because the Home Secretary regards his expressions ofopinion as prejudicial to the war effort, there is nothing to preventthe Home Secretary locking up anyone who expresses opinions whichthe Government choose to regard as prejudicial, including possiblyM.Ps. if they express opinions in circumstances in which they arenot protected by the privileges of Parliament.(c) The House of Commons has been vigilant in criticising and limiting anyDefence Regulations which are calculated to restrict expressions ofopinion, and it may be felt that such vigilance has been futile if thereis latent in Regulation 18b a power by which the Home Secretary canin his unfettered discretion make detention orders against any persons whose expressions of opinion constitute in his view acts prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the realm.6. In my view a person who seeks to undermine the morale of the nationby spreading defeatist doctrines and palliating the consequences of a Nazidomination of Europe is clearly guilty of acts prejudicial to the public safety and the defence of the realm, and it would be my wish to make a detention orderagainst such a person if, having regard to his persistence in such propaganda andall the circumstances of the case, I come to the conclusion that it is in the words of Regulation 18b &quot; necessary to exercise control over him.&quot;The risk, however, has to be weighed that the use of Regulation 18b as an instrument for dealing with propaganda even though it is used sparingly and only in very bad cases may be regarded as a misuse of the Regulation and maystrengthen the demands for amendments of this Regulation.There are also legal difficulties about which I attach a note by the Attorney-General.H. M.Home Office, November 14, 1941.APPENDIX.Note by the Attorney-General.Should Detention Orders be made under Defence Regulation 186 against persons carrying on Prejudicial Propaganda.I HAVE read the Memorandum by the Home Secretary on this subject andhe has asked me to consider the legal aspects raised in it. If action was takenin the case suggested and the man sought to challenge it by habeas corpusproceedings, his line would be that the acts, particulars of which would have beengiven him by the Chairman of the Advisory Committee, were not actsprejudicial&quot; within the meaning of Regulation 18b. If he could satisfy theCourt on this point I think he might well make out his claim. In developingthis argument he would, I think, be entitled to refer to and rely on the existingDefence Regulations dealing with propaganda and expressions of opinion, andalso on the change that was made on the 23rd November, 1939, when the presentRegulation 39b was substituted for the original Regulation 39b. Under theoriginal Regulation it was an offence to endeavour, whether orally or otherwise,
to influence public opinion in a manner likely to be prejudicial to the defence ofthe Realm or the efficient prosecution of the war. As a result of the debate inthe House this was withdrawn and the present Regulation substituted, theGovernment thereby clearlv indicating that as a matter of policy the&quot; endeavours &quot; previously made illegal were to be treated as lawful, except in sofar as they were brought within the terms of the new Regulation The Memo-randum assumes that the activities in question cannot be so brought, and so faras I have seen the documents in question I agree with this assumption. Thereis another Regulation which could be referred to with some force, namely, 2c.That provides a code, and I agree a somewhat cumbrous one, for dealing with persons who are concerned in the systematic publication of matter which is, inthe opinion of the Secretary of State, calculated to foment opposition to the prosecution to a successful issue of the war. It would be said, therefore, with considerable force that the Legislature has provided that propaganda is notunlawful by reason only of the fact that it is likely to be prejudicial to the war effort, and &quot;has further provided what steps can be taken and what penalties mayfollow if there is systematic publication of propaganda of this kind. It would therefore be argued that, although the writings and propaganda might in the wide sense of the term be &quot; prejudicial,&quot; they are acts which by a deliberate act of policy have been made lawful, and the mode of dealing with them, if they arepersisted in and are of a grave character, has been expressly provided for by regulation 2c. It would therefore be said that they could not come within theproper construction of the acts prejudicial, which are a condition precedent tothe exercise of the drastic powers under 18b. I think there is very considerableforce in this argument, and the recent decision of the House of Lords, which isvery satisfactory on the main issue which has been raised, would not, I think,cover the point or assist.Though I have seen one or two of the documents which are referred to in theMemorandum, I would, of course, be very ready to look through any of them tosee whether the particulars which have to be given to the internee could be properly framed in a way which would avoid the formidable legal difficulty which,I think, action on the lines suggested might bring upon us.D.
