The background to this despatch is provided by the increasing amountof information which has reached His Majesty&apos;s -Embassy in recent weeks,suggesting that the leading Spanish Generals have completed their plans for anearly coup d&apos;Etat designed to get rid of Senor Sutler and of the Falange, andpossibly also of General Franco himself. They are mainly discontented overinternal affairs, e.g., maladministration by the Falange, lack of food, &amp;c.3. The Spanish Generals have threatened to take action against Senor Sutleron many occasions during the past year, but they have hitherto invariably drawnback at the last moment, no doubt largely owing to fear of possible Germanreactions.4. The present German preoccupation with the Russian campaign does notalter the strategical fact that Germany is in a position at relatively short notice to dispose of any Spanish resistance. In such circumstances any Spanish Govern-ment, whatever its complexion, is likely, once in office, to fall under german influence, as Colonel Beigbeder suggests. The present situation has at least theadvantage that, owing to the extreme unpopularity of Senor Sutler and of theFakinge, all classes in Spain are increasingly opposed to the German-inspiredpolicy of the present Government and well-disposed towards this country. Thesubstitution of a less unpopular regime, which would still find itself compelled tobow to German pressure, might not therefore benefit us to any important extent.5. To sum up, I remain sceptical of the likelihood of a coupt d&apos;Etat by theSpanish Generals in the near future, and I am also doubtful whether a changeof regime in Spain would be to our advantage until German influence lessens andthe new regime is therefore able to carry out a truly independent policy.A.

ANNEX.Mr. Yencken to Mr. Eden.(No. 421.   Most Secret.)Sir, Madrid, October 24, 1941.IN rny despatch No. 389 of the 3rd October, I reported a conversation between the Military Attache and General Aranda. I now have the honour toreport two conversations this week between Major Lubbock, the Assistant military attache, and Colonel Beigbeder, former Minister for Foreign Affairs.2: The latter was, as usual, chiefly concerned with the plans which heintends to carry out in the event of a German entry into Spain. On the internal political question he was contemptuous of the prospects of success of a military-Government, and emphasised again his own determination never to play the&quot; Mexican general.&quot; His attitude to such a scheme has always been that it was bound in the end to fail, owing to mutual jealousies, inexperience and competi-tion for places among the generals concerned. On this occasion, however, he wentfurther, and described further possible objections to a military coup.3. He said that the Germans were well aware of Senor Serrano Suner&apos;sunpopularity, of his critical situation and of the failure of Falange as a whole,and that for that reason they were manoeuvring for a change of front. the generals, with the exception of Aranda, had on the whole very little comprehensive-sion of the danger to Spain which German domination and a German victoryrepresented. For that reason, if they did succeed in ousting Serrano Sutler andattaining power themselves they would be likely to fall under German influencemore completely than Suner himself has done.4. German pressure would in that event be brought to bear in a new way.The Falange would be thrown over and proposals would be made (and are already being suggested) for a German-assisted restoration of the Monarchy. GeneralAranda, it was true, was aware of this danger, but he was alone in this, and couldnot do anything by himself. His stock was rising, but he still suffered too much inhis reputation from his past republicanism, and he would be in a minority in any possible military Government. General Franco, according to Colonel Beigbeder,was himself conscious of this danger of a Junta of Generals becoming tools ofGermany and this was one of the reasons for his support of Serrano Suner,and his efforts to bring about a reconciliation between him and the Generals.5. According to Colonel Beigbeder, General Franco&apos;s views on the signifi-cance of Hitlerian Germany and the possible outcome of the war were at lastdeveloping in a more reasonable direction.6. It is interesting to note that Colonel Beigbeder is so against the Generals,but I think that this is largely due to their unwillingness to take him into theircounsels or to trust his discretion. I do not share his view that they would come under German influence and domination so easily, or agree to his implication that the last state of Spain would be worse than the first. The main desire ofthe Generals is to keep Spain out of the war and independent, and they distrustSerrano Suner&apos;s intentions in this respect. Colonel Beigbeder may feel that, inthe task of evading German pressure or an ultimatum, Serrano Suner, backed byGeneral Franco, would be a better match for the Germans than any of the Generals-- but the question is, can anyone inside or outside Spain trust Suner ?7. Colonel Beigbeder also fears that the Generals (especially Vigon) mightbe manoeuvred by the Germans into a premature restoration of the Monarchy,which he considers would be disastrous.8. I have sent copies of this despatch to His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affairesat Lisbon.and to the Governor of Gibraltar.I have, &amp;c.A. F. Yencken.
