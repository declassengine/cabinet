(41)  255. COPY IIO, ? C(aOTH OCTOBER,   1941.WAR CABINET,&apos;   AMENDMENT OF THE REGENCY ACT,.   1957.Note by the Lord Chancellor.,I am entirely in favour of the general proposal madein the Home Secretary&apos;s Memorandum W,P.-, (41)  250 of October28th, &quot;but I wish to express a doubt as to trie precise methodsuggested in the draft Defence Regulation for carrying outthe proposal,Is it really desirable to insert in a defence regulation which will he necessarily made public (indeed theHome Secretary suggests that a question in Parliament shouldhe arranged which will draw attention to it) to deal with thehypothesis that &quot;the Sovereign is &quot;by reason of enemy actionnot available for the performance of the royal functions&quot;?While it is undoubtedly prudent to make any necessary provision, a Defence Regulation in these express terms wouldsurely lend itself to misinterpretation &quot;by Nazi, propaganda and might excite speculations in the. United States,It is quite unnecessary to insert this  Ln the regulation, for the essential purpose to he served can heeasily effected without it.What is the difficulty to he met?      It is thepossibility that a quorum of the five individuals mentionedill Section 2(1)  of the Regency Act,  1937,  might not be available to make the declaration that the Sovereign is forsome definite cause not available for the performance of hisroyal functions.      The remedy for this is;,  I agree,  toincrease the panel of five by adding others, and on everyground the members of the Judicial Committee are the bestpersons to add.      Having done this,  everything that isnecessary follows without ever mentioning tho King&apos;s name inthe Defence Regulation at all.      The words Inserted inSection 2 about the Sovereign &quot;for some definite cause notbeing available&quot; were purposely left wide;    at the time whatwas chiefly contemplated was that the King might be visitingthe Dominions.      Indeed, the only time that the section over-has been made use of was when the King and Queen went to canada before the war.      But the words equally apply if theKing should be cut off by an invading German army, and i cannot see that it is cither necessary or wise to specifyin the text of the Regulation that this is a misfox^tunewhich would require the certificate to be- given.

If the draftsman felt that something is needed inthe language of the Regulation to show that it is connectedwith the Defence of the Realm,  it would he quite enough tohave the recital that,  in the circumstances of the war, acjuorum of the five individuals who may certify might not heread.ily available.I hope I may ho excused for offering these remarks ona War Cabinet document as I was myself the Minister whoframed and carried the Regency Act, and the holder of myoffice is specially concerned with the matter,      I imagine,in any case, that His Majesty would he informed of what isproposed before the public here and abroad have their attention called to the possibility of his being notavailable &quot;by reason of enemy action&quot;..SoHouse of Lords9 S.W.I.
