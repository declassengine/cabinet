THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.  November 1941.SECRET.Copy No.  29W.P. (41) 264.November 9, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SEIZURE OF VICHY SHIPS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE War Cabinet, at its meeting on the 3rd November, &quot; invited theForeign Secretary to explain to the Vichy Government that, having regard tothe course of action which, they were pursuing (as exemplified by, e.g., the carryingof rubber to Germany in French ships), we proposed to hold five ships seized southof Durban.&quot;2. It so happens that correspondence is already in progress with the vichy government, through the intermediary of the United States Government, in thecourse of which we have justified our policy of seizing all French ships sailingwithout our express permission, either on the ground of their carryingcontraband, or as an act of reprisal for the detention by the French Governmentof British and Allied shipping, or, where applicable, for resistance to visit and search or attempted scuttling.3. In view of this correspondence, I invited representatives of theAdmiralty, Dominions Office, Ministry of Economic Warfare and the Ministryof War Transport to discuss with my Department and my Legal Adviser theappropriate action to be taken in pursuance of the Cabinet conclusion.4. We have hitherto always been very careful to represent to the vichy government that we are merely exercising our normal belligerent rights in seizingtheir ships, and to put the whole matter on that basis. His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have also stated that all ships carrying cargo to or from any port in thenavicert area without a ship navicert are liable to seizure, together with their cargoes, under our Reprisals Order of July 1940. It is thought that the communication proposed in the Cabinet conclusion, associating the seizure ofthese particular ships with our disapproval of previous actions of the vichy government, might be inconsistent with these arguments, and might givesubstance to the contention which the Vichy Government have already putforward that our real object is simply to replace our own lost tonnage, and thatour seizures are arbitrary and have no sound legal basis.5. In the meantime a communique has been issued by the Admiralty (copyannexed), explaining in general terms our grounds for intercepting these ships.6. If, as appears likely, these ships are requisitioned by the South african government, the latter would, in accordance with established practice, assume theresponsibility for this act, and any protest received from the Vichy Governmentwould be answered by referring them to the Government of South Africa.11545   [23128]
7. I therefore recommend to my colleagues that no specific communication should be made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom to the vichy Government about these ships.&quot; &apos; \   . &apos;    A. E.Foreign Office, November 9, 1941.ANNEX.Official Admiralty Communique.THE Vichy Government have recently been attempting to run contraband forthe Germans from the East to France in escorted convoys. Our patrols sightedone such convoy escorted by a French sloop, and the necessary forces were thensent to intercept the convoy off South Africa. On the arrival of our forces theescorting sloop was requested to direct the convoy to proceed into port so thatit could be examined in accordance with our belligerent rights. This request was refused, and so steps were taken to board the ships, upon which three outof five made a determined attempt to scuttle themselves. Their action was,however, frustrated by the prompt steps taken by our boarding parties. this attempt can only have been made in compliance with the instructions which theGermans are known to have given, that French ships are to scuttle themselvesrather than allow search to be carried out and their guilty cargoes disclosed.The operation is still proceeding.
