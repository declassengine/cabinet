Thi3 Document is the Property of Mis Britannic Majesty&apos;s Governmg..iwnDr* TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KW.P.(41) 275.      It is requested that special case may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document,1 9 NOV 1941 INDIA:    RELEASE OF SATYAGRAHI PRISONERS.(Ref.: Vfer Cabinet Conclusions 115(41) of 17th November1941.    Minute 4(1)).Report by the Lord Bpivy Seal.The Committee consisting of the Lord Chancellor,  the lord president, the Secretary of State for India and myself met on18th November under my chairmanship and present the following report on the constitutional issues involved and two draft telegrams to the Government of India for consideration by theCabinet:-The Government of India Act as enacted in 1935 vests in theProvincial Governments (S.49(2) read with items 1 and 4 in List ii in the Seventh Schedule)  the exclusive executive authority inrelation to public order, the administration of justice, prisonsetc. and persons detained therein.      It is a matter of first importance that in ordinary conditions the Central Executiveshould not, save to the extent permitted by other provisions inthe Act, trench on this exclusive field of the ProvincialExecutive, and that the demarcation of their respective fieldsshould not be blurred.2.       A state of war, however, establishes abnormal conditions and to meet such conditions S. 126 A., enacted in 1939,  increases the executive authority of the Central Government to the extentof enabling it to give directions to a Provincial Government as tothe manner In which the latter&apos;s executive authority shall beexercised, without any qualification save that a Proclamation ofEmergency must be in operation whereby the Governor General has declared that the security of India is threatened byr war.3.       The offences for the commission of which the Satyagrahiprisoners are detained are directly due to the existence of anemergency and are the &quot;creation&quot; of the Central Government.    , TheGovernor General in 1939 declared by Proclamation (s.102) theexistence of a grave emergency.      Thereupon he promulgated (S.72of the 9th Schedule) the Defence of India Ordinance,  subsequentlyenacted as the Defence of India Act (XXXV of 1939),  the Rulesunder which constituted as an offence, inter alia, the &quot;acting in any manner prejudicial to ..... the efficient prosecution of the war&quot;.4.       It is true that the administration of the lav/, within themischief of which the new offence created by the actions of theCentral Executive and the Central Legislature falls,  is,  like theadministration of the ordinary criminal law, the exclusive function of the Provincial Executives (save in so far as the CentralGovernment supervises the discharge of similar functions in theChief Commissioners&apos; Provinces);    but it was a decision of policy by the Central Executive, dealing with, an all-India movementprejudicial to the efficient prosecution of the war,  that theSatyagrahis&apos;  token offence should be dealt with by the rigorousapplication of the new law.       Conversely it is for the CentralExecutive to decide (or to recommend for approval by H.M.Government)that the all-India movement which it was the purpose of therepressive measures administered by the Provincial Governments to check, has been scotched and that the efficient prosecution ofthe war will be promoted not by the continued detention of offenders convicted for the particular offence in question buthy their release. r/-

5.      But the execution of this decision of policy,  taken bythe Central Executive on grounds of all-India import, doesvery directly trench upon the executive authority of theprovinces since the release of prisoners v? ith un-expiration redsentences involves the disposal of persons detained inprisons,  questions of prison administration, and considerations of public order in the Provinces - all of which are pre-eminently the functions of the Provincial executive authority and,  ordinarily, exclusively their functions.    lection 126aauthorises,, while a declared state of emergency exists,  the requisite invasion of the Provincial Executive field by theCentral Executive.6.      But if,   in order to secure the execution of its decisionof all-India &quot;policy,  the Central Government has to use theProvincial Governments as its instrument and make use of thepowers conferred, by S.126A it firms t exercise those powers, andno others,    nor must it shirk any of the responsibilityinvolved in the exercise of those powers.    It is not enoughthat (as contemplated in the original announcement proposed,by the Government of India nor even in the announcement asamended toy their telegram No,6467)  it should declare its decision of policy and leave to the Provincial governments the responsibility of devising ways and. means to carry it contributory of weighing the desirability of carrying it out against theparticular local dangers of doing so;    it is not enough that it.should announce that it has decided to execute its own policyin the areas in which it discharges itself executive authority and &quot;advise all Provincial Governments to follow the same -course&quot;;    it must &quot;give directions to a Province as to themanner in which the executive authority thereof is to beexercised&quot;.7.      If therefore it is decided for the reasons indicated in paras.9 and 10 of hi P.(41)273 or for others to approve thepolicy recommended by the Governor General in Council to release forthwith all persons convicted or detained for thetoken offences against the law which they specify, a suitableannouncement strictly compatible with.the provisions of the relevant sections of the Government of India Act might be asin the annexed draft B.     (a summary of the considerations setout in this Report in a form suitable for telegraphing to theGovernment of India is annexed as annexure A.)8.      No regard has been taken in the foregoing paragraphs ofthe consideration that in relation to the Provinces administered under S.93 by the Governor in his discretion it would bepossible for the Governor General in the exercise of his discretion under B.54 to issue directions for the release ofprisoners-&apos;    for the constitutional question in issue is theright of the Governor General in Council  to intrude into thefield of Provincial responsibility in the pursuance of anall-India policy.Though,  as is explained, this right is conferred by S..126Aduring the continuance of an emergency and is conferred without qualification,  it is obvious and should be emphasised that touse this right for purposes other than those calculates to minimise the declared dangers to India&apos;s security would go beyond the clear intention of this emergency provision,Two telegrams, one received from the Government of India sincethe Cabinet meeting of 17th November and the other conveyingthe interim conclusion of that meeting to the Government ofIndia are attached as annexures C and D.&quot;VW;y-v..,,

Annexure A.- Revised draft announcement.The Government of India have no intention of relaxing themeasures which they have already taken and which they willcontinue to take against activities ox propaganda calculated to impede the -war effort or to promote mass disorder.   On the*ther hand they are animated by a sincere desire to secure thegreatest measure of public support and unity in meeting the threat to India&apos;a security created by the war.     i&apos;Cr thisreason they are anxious that no person should be kept injail whose detention is not necessary in the interests of the prosecution of the warj and they consider that no necessitynow remains to hold in custody persons who have been convictedor detained either for participating in the civil disobedience movement or for having given notice of their intention to do so.Within this category they include net,only persons who merelyrecited prescribed slogans but also those who accompanied suchrecital with a speech net materially adding to its substance.Accordingly the Government of India, exercising- the powers conferred upon them lor use during the existence of a declared stateof emergency, are at once issuing directions to ail provincial governments and to the Governments of the Chief Ccamuisionex &apos; sProvinces, to release /forthwith or/7 as soon as the varyingadministrative requirements of the respective provinces permit, tillprisoners who fall within the categories described above. In complying with these general directions the provincial Governments will be accorded discretion to determine the order in which individualprisoners shall be released, the period over which the processsf release should be spread and measures required to ensure that public order is not  ire judrcedj in the United provinces wherethe/

the number ox such prisoners is lar larger than elsewhere the process will inevitably take longer than in o chorprovince s.Though neither oi them comes strictly within the categories described above, the GovernnSbnt oi&apos; the united provinces have agreed to release forthwith iJbdul KalamAzad /and Pandit Jawaharlal Kehru/ /or, alitorriativoly;,and so to modafy the terms oi the sentence imposedo;i panclii jawaharlal Nehru as to effect hat early discharfrom prisor/.

Draft telegram to Governor-General. *___ *C economy telegram of 17th November, No. 14733.   Constitutional issues as between Central Government and provinces involved by proposedrelease of Satyagrahi prisoners have now&quot; been examined and our conclusions are as follows:-(l)    It is of the highest importance that in ordinary conditions the Central Executive should not trench upon the exclusive field of the Provincial Executive which embraces the disposal of personsdetained in prison, questions of prison administration and considerations of public order in the Provinces.(2)    A state of war, however, establishes abnormal conditions to meet which Section 126 A increases the executive field of theCentral Government to the extent of enabling it, during thecontinuance of a declared state of emergency, to give directions to aProvincial Government as to the manner in which the latter&apos;s executive authority should be exercised.    The actions for which theSatyagrahi prisoners are detained only constitute offences against thelaw owing to the existence of an emergency of the order postulated inSection 126 A and these offences have been created by the CentralGovernment through the enactment of the Defence of India Act.    It was adecision of policy by the Central Executive that the token offences committed by the satyagrahis     should be dealt with by the rigorousapplication of the new law so created, and conversely it is a decisionof policy by the Central&apos; Government that the efficient prosecution of thewar will now be promoted better by the relaxation than the continuance ofthe se measures.(3)    But just as the administration of the law under which thesatyagrahis 1     offences have been dealt with is, like theadministration of the ordinary criminal law, the exclusive function of the Provincial Executive, so the relaxation of the CentralGovernment&apos;s policy involves action which ordinarily is the exclusivefunction/

function of the Provincial Government and in order to ensure theexecution of its decision of all-India policy the Central Governmenthas to use the Provincial Government as its instrument, and to thisend it has to exercise the powers conferred by Section 126.A.In doing so, however, it must exercise the powers conferred by that section and no others and it must not shirk any of theresponsibility involved in the exercise of those powers.    It is not enough that it should declare a decision of policy and leave toProvincial Governments the responsibility of finding means to carry it out, nor is it enough that it should announce that it has decided to execute its own policy in the areas in which it itself dischargesexecutive authority and &quot;advise all Provincial Governments to follow the same course&quot;.    It must &quot;give directions, repeat directions, toa Province as to the manner in which the executive authority thereofIs to be exercised&quot; to secure the purpose in view.(4)    His Majesty&apos;s Government approve . in principle therecommendations to release satyagrahi prisoners of the categoriesdescribed, and in view of the foregoing appreciation of theconstitutional issues involved consider that the announcement ofthe decision to do so should be in the form contained in my immediately following telegram.(5) It is obvious from the foregoing examination of the implications ofSection 126.A that the power conferred is an extremely wide one.    Butit is obvious, and His Majesty&apos;s Government consider that emphasis should be laid on the fact, that though the Section does not in termsattach any qualification to the exercise of the powers conferred, itwould contravene the clear intention of this emergency provision to use the powers for any other purposes than such as are calculated to minimise the declared danger to the securitj&apos;- of India caused by the existenceof a state of war.

D E C 1 ? H E R   .0P.1E LB 6R A II.From        Government of India, Home Department, to Secretaryof State for India.Dated      New Delhi, 23*40 hours, 17th November 1941.Received 21*30 hours, 17th November, 1941.xxx6467.Continuation of our telegram. No, 6415 of November 14th,   Release ofSatyagrahis.    Governments of Madras and United Provinces have now signifiedtheir acquiescence on certain conditions in the action proposed althoughboth adhere to their previous opinion that -policy itself is   mistaken, thaiit is unlikely&apos;&quot; to achieve any useful purpose and that it nay have apositively bad effect.2,     Madras ask that it should be made clear that policy is that of central Government so as to avoid any impression that they themselves haveadvocated it.    They anticipate no difficulty in execution of policy but criticise wording of our proposed announcement, seeing contradiction,between first sentence and second which proposes releases of very personsvflio have been opposing war effort.    They think it would be better to statethat gesture is made in hope that it nail lead Congress to abandonSatyagraha. movement.3.     United provinces on the other hand anticipate that large releasesmay produce anti-war and anti-Government demonstrations ishich. may lead todisorder and therefore wish it to be made clear that words &quot;administrativerequirements&quot; in announcement include the time required to considerdoubtful cases and to reduce to minimum chances of such demonstrations.They also ask that announcement should make it clear (a) that gestureis not intended to sacrifice to Congress either now or at final settlementafter war, the interests of Minorities or of those supporting war effort;(b) that whole-hearted support of war must he sine qua non of return ofany Ministry to Office and (c) that object of releases is to ensure that noone is kept in jail longer than administnatively necessary.Finally they wish it to be made clear that case of Nehru and Azad nail bethe only exceptions in category of immediate releases and that their releasesalso are not a surrender to Congress.    (Neither of them actually recitedprescribed slogans, so strictly speaking they do not fall within the categorydescribed).   We consider United Provinces suggestion (a) obviouslyinappropriate v/hile (b) is a major issue of policy on which no generalpronouncement could appropriately be made incidentally and in a comiauniqudsuch as the present and any pronouncement regarding which would have to benost carefully concerted with His Majesty1 s Government.    The other united provinces suggestions might be met if our announcement were expanded asfollows:    (I)    Second sentence to begin as follows:    &quot;On the other hand&quot;they are anxious to ensure that no one is kept in jail longer than isadministratively necessary, and they consider it no longer necessary etc.&quot;19230. 2SSECRET.

(2) at the end after the words &quot;administrative requirements permit&quot;add &quot;owing to far larger number of prisoners in the united provinces the process will take longer there than elsewhere&quot;(3) then add the following:-   &quot;the Government of the united provinces hap also agreed to release forthwith bothAhul Kalan Azad and P.:-rf!it Jawaharlal I\Tehru, although neither of them cones strictly within the category described above&quot;.We do net regard apparent contradiction between the first and second measures cf oar announcement as reel; but to meet thispoint by Madras arid other point made by United Provinces as far aspossible., the most we can suggest is that announcement might endwith a separate paragraph as follows:   Begins   &quot;This action has beentaken by the Central Government solely from their desire to make every possible contribution towards the creation cf a better atmospherein which energies of the country may be united in the supreme task of winning the war&quot;    mJr,,We feel strongly that both Madras and United provinces fail to appreciate plainly.great political importance of this issue,given recent expansion of the Governor General1s Executive Comicil.5o     We still regard it as essential that action taken should beuniform in all provinces.    We could not agree to take actionourselves in the Chief Commissioners1 Provinces leaving it to theG-overnors&apos; Provinces to do as they thought fit.    (a) Becausemembers in the Chief Commissioners&apos; provinces are very snail,(b) Because this would inevitably produce the most undesirableimpression that the Central Government and Governors&apos; Provincescould act independently in a matter which is obviously of all&quot;Indiacharacter and maximum importance.

POL. 6295/41.J;al^Ja^a*r;^.^iH:-      Release of prisoners.Cabinet feel that eca-itttlxn6icrial issues of relationship of Central Cu?5.a:,v;at to Provinces involved in your proposed statement are so important that they cannot authorise it without further consideration. This consideration they propose to give with every desire to help you and yourExecutive and to communicate their reasoned conclusions assoon as possible.       Meahwhile they suggest that the bestkind of answer you can give to Joshi&apos;s motion is to thegeneral effect that it raises the difference of conditionsin different Provinces etc. and therefore needs furthercareful consideration which your Government will givewithout unnecessary delay and in a sympathetic spirit.     they see no objection to releases being freely expedited afterAssembly has risen and in particular would wish you wheneveryou think the suitable moment has come but not, repeat neat,in to-morrow&apos;s Debate, to announce that you are treatingNehru1 s sentences as concurrent.
