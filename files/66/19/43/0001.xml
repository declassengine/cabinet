NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1. Two Italian convoys have been destroyed in the Mediterranean and heavy losses were inflicted on the escorting destroyers.British and Allied submarines in the Mediterranean have had considerablesuccesses against enemy shipping and have sunk a U-boat.Our shipping losses have been light.Home Waters.2. H.M. Trawlers Francolin and Commander Holbrook shot down aDornier 17 which attacked them off the Haisborough Light on the 12th.Francolin was hit by a bomb and sank. H.M. Destroyer Quantock, on convoy escourt duty, shot down a Dornier 215 off Whitby on the 10th.H.M. Destroyers Keppel and Venomous were in collision off Cape Wrath.The latter was badly holed but was towed into port.It is estimated that 10,900 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or damaged by our aircraft.  Details are given in the Air Situation.North Atlantic.3. On the 3rd H.M. Submarine Trident, on patrol in the vicinity of theNorth Cape, obtained one torpedo hit on an escorted eastbound convoy, and laterestimated a hit on a 2,000-ton vessel which had turned back from this convoy.On the 7th she obtained a hit on a ship escorted by two trawlers. The shipturned away, but was not seen to sink.H.M. Trawler Kingston A gate intercepted the Swedish ships Vasaholmv4,2l7 tons) and Tunaholm (3,581 tons) 200 miles west of the Faroes on the 6th.When escorting a southbound convoy, Martlet aircraft from H.M. AuxiliaryAircraft Carrier Audacity destroyed two Focke-Wulf aircraft on the8th November, 260 miles west of Oporto. One Martlet was shot down duringthe engagement.Mediterranean.4. H.M. Cruisers Aurora and Penelope and the Destroyers Lance andLively, acting on the report of a Maryland aircraft, proceeded on the evening of 8th to intercept a southbound convoy in the Ionian Sea. It was a brightmoonlight night and, after the first sighting, our force was able to work roundso as to have the enemy silhouetted against the moon. As the range closed the convoy was found to consist of four destroyers and eight merchant ships, with asecond convoy of two destroyers and two merchant ships joining them. Fire was opened at just under 6,000 yards range, and the first salvo hit a destroyer.Two destroyers were sunk in a few minutes and a third was badly damaged.An ammunition ship was hit and blew up. At least twelve torpedoes were firedby the enemy and of four fired by H.M. ships three scored hits. A total of ninemerchant ships was sunk and a 10,000-ton tanker was set on fire and is considered a total loss. Our ships suffered no damage or casualties, and took no prisoners.They were ineffectually attacked by torpedo bombers during the morning.H.M. Submarine Upholder after the engagement sighted two Trento classcruisers (8-inch guns), which had apparently been covering the convoys, and six destroyers escorting a damaged one. She sank ope destroyer and hit another, whichwas last seen in tow with the stern under and the fore part out of water.5. An operation to reinforce Malta with aircraft was carried out by the gibraltar force. Fifty aircraft were flown off, of which 47 reached their destination and 3 are missing.Submarines returning from patrol during the period have reported a numberof successful attacks. Triumph torpedoed a 6,000-ton ship in the Gulf of Athenson the 15th October, and a week later, in the same area, sank two small caiques.Truant, in an attack on a southbound convoy off the heel of Italy on 23rd October,sank a 3,500-ton ship and damaged an 8,000-ton armed merchant cruiser. Thefollowing day, off Monopoli (further to the northward) she shelled and set on fire a 3,500-ton ship in ballast, which was seen burning some hours later.
On the 31st October, off Ortona (about half-way up the Italian Adriaticcoast), Truant obtained one hit on a convoy of three tankers escorted by a destroyer.Thrasher shelled and sank an 800-ton schooner, apparently laden with petrol,off Benghazi on the 28th October.The Polish Submarine Sokol, off Naples, torpedoed a ship of the Citta diPalermo class (5,413 tons) which was escorting a northbound convoy on the25th October. On the 2nd November, when north-east of Sicily, she shelled and sank a 3,000-ton laden ship proceeding independently.Utmost, on the 1st November, off Kuriat Island (Tunis, Gulf of Hammamet),effectively shelled a ship on which salvage operations were proceeding. This was probably one of the ships torpedoed by Urge on the 22nd October. (Resume,No. 113, paragraph 5.)Upholder sank a southbound U-boat on the 8th November about 90 miles east of Malta.Russian submarines are reported to have sunk the Italian tanker Torcello(3,336 tons), which entered the Black Sea on the 5th November, and a Roumanianship, either the Regeli Carole I (2,369 tons) or the Tzar Ferdinand (1,994 tons),off the Bulgarian coast.It is estimated that 5,000 tons of enemy shipping have been sunk or damaged in the Mediterranean by our aircraft during the period; details are given in theAir Situation.During the week, four French merchant ships (about 8,000 tons) have passed gibraltar westbound, and ten ships and two trawlers (40,000 tons) westbound.All were under escort.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. In addition to the U-boat sunk by H.M. Submarine Upholder (reportedin the Mediterranean section), there have been three very promising attacks by aircraft, one off La Rochelle, one north-east of Cape Ortegal and the third250 miles west of Ushant. Surface craft probably damaged a U-boat west ofAlexandria, and convoy escorts made an attack in mid-Atlantic with unknownresults.Enemy Intelligence.7. The Pocket Battleship Admiral Scheer, which has not recently been located by air reconnaissance, is believed to be still in the Baltic. She is, how-ever, ready for active operations. The Battleship Tirpitz was alongside at Kielon the 9th November.U-boats.8. It is estimated that a reduced number of U-boats were operating duringthe period in two main groups, one to the south of Greenland and the other tothe west of Portugal.Interrogation of prisoners from the U. Ill, sunk by the Trawler Lady Shirleyon the 4th October, confirms the impression that enemy U-boat complements arenow not only less experienced than before, but that their preliminary training has been to some extent curtailed. The Captain of the U. Ill is said to haveundergone a course of two or three months in the autumn of 1940, though he didnot actually go to sea except for an instructional cruise, till he took the boat fromwhich he was captured. On her first cruise, in May 1941, the First Lieutenantwas in his first appointment after only one month&apos;s instruction in submarines.The Engineer Officer was the most experienced of the officers on board and had made four war-time cruises. The Captain under instruction accompanying theU. Ill had received four weeks submarine instruction, plus three weeks specialcourse for captains. Of the petty officers and ratings, only six had previous U-boatexperience.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. A ship was torpedoed in mid-Atlantic but is believed to be still afloat;this is the only U-boat casualty reported during the week.Enemy aircraft have been active on the East Coast and have sunk a ship offFlamborough Head by night and a trawler off St. Abb&apos;s Head by day. Four ships[23144] B
were damaged by aircraft attack. A small vessel was sunk by explosion, probably a mine, in the Dee Estuary. The Focke-Wulf aircraft have made continualefforts to locate the homeward-bound Gibraltar convoy, in the vicinity of which two were shot down on the 8th.The shipping losses in October (details of which are given in Appendix I)were 45 ships totalling 197,405 tons, of which 28 ships (133,722 tons) were British.This total is about 70,000 tons lower than in the previous month. Twenty-nineships were sunk by U-boats, principally in mid-Atlantic. Four ships weremined, two in the Thames Estuary, one off the East Coast, and one in the suez canal. Two ships were sunk by E-boats off the Norfolk coast. Ten ships were sunk by aircraft, five off the East Coast, two in the Suez area, one in the western mediterranean, one to the west of Gibraltar, and one in the St. George&apos;s Channel.In addition, two British ships and three small craft totalling 7,637 tons, which areincluded in Appendix I, were reported in October but lost in previous months.Commencing with the graph issued this week the graphs of shipping losses are being made out in quarterly instead of monthly periods. The monthly tonnageof broken periods is shown separately for purposes of comparison. Through anerror, these latter figures (for September and October 1941) in this week&apos;s graphare shown as one-third of their correct totals, and will be corrected when the nextmonthly graph is published.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending the 12th November 925 ships, including 172Allied and 47 neutral, were convoyed. Four cruisers, two anti-aircraft ships,eighty-three destroyers (including thirty United States destroyers) and ninetythree sloops, corvettes and minesweepers were employed On escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week endingNovember 8th were 1,295,823 tons, compared with 785,295 tons during the previous seven days. Oil imports were 489,913 tons. Mineral imports were 279,450 tons, ofwhich 196,246 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Wood and pulpimports were 29,535 tons, and copra and palm oil 19,750 tons. Cereals amountedto 172,402 tons, of which 14,350 tons were rice. Other food imports totalled181,929 tons, and the principal commodities, in tons, were: sugar 58,124,refrigerated and tinned meat, bacon and ham 30,662, fruit 12,302 (1,172 tons of fresh apples), evaporated milk 9,884, tea 7,085, lard and cooking fats 5,252,fish 4,802, butter 3,005, cheese 2,204, jam and honey 2,043, eggs 1,891. There were also 19,577 tons of unspecified tinned food.  Tobacco imports were 10,043 tons.Imports of textiles, jute, hemp, machinery and war stores were most satisfactory.The estimated imports for the month of October proved to be greater than any other month during the last six months and one of the best months ofthe war. The total tanker imports for the month amounted to 1,395,000 tons, andthe total non-tanker imports of raw materials amounted to 1,585,000 tons, and for food 1,230,000 tons. The total non-tanker imports, including these figures for food and raw materials, and a certain number of miscellaneous imports, under theBoard of Trade programme, amount to 2,888,000 tons.These figures of imports do not include imports from Eire.British Minelaying.11. Mines have been laid during the week in the Faroes area. Minelayingby aircraft has been carried out off the German North Sea ports and Oslo.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.12. Enemy minelaying aircraft visited the Thames Estuary on three occasions during the period. They also operated off the Yorkshire and Durhamcoast, and one was reported near Fishguard.Six magnetic and four acoustic mines have been destroyed during the week.The mine totals are now : Magnetic 1,501, Acoustic 1,152, moored 1,063.
MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Finland.13. No change has taken place since last week. The Germans have made noattacks on the Murmansk front, and elsewhere the position has become temporarilystabilised.Leningrad sector.14. The situation around the city itself remains unchanged. reports received state that the morale of the garrison and of the population is good.To the eastward, the German progress from the River Volkhov mentionedlast week has continued, and Tikhvin, 250 miles west of Vologda on the leningrad-Vologda railway, has been captured.Kalinin area.15. Fighting in this area has been severe and the Germans, who have beenattacking strongly towards Torzhak and at Kalinin, have suffered considerablelosses and failed to improve their position.Central sector.16. Press reports of violent fighting on this sector are, in view of the bad weather conditions, exaggerated. In the fighting that has taken place due west of Moscow the Germans have not progressed, and the Russians have counter-attacked on the Mozhaisk-Moscow road.Further south, German pressure on Tula from the north-west has increased,but the general situation here has not altered.Kursk has been captured by the Germans, but it is believed that progresseastwards from the town has been repelled by the Russians.-. Ukraine.17. There is little information of the fighting on this front, but it isprobable that the advance of Axis forces to the River Donetz has been hamperedas much by bad weather as by Russian resistance. A German drive to cut theVoronezh-Rostov railway has resulted in heavy fighting with severe losses on both sides.  This drive suggests an attempt to outflank Rostov from the north.Rostov sector.18.   The position immediately west of the town remains unchanged.Crimea.19. German forces have overrun almost the whole of the Crimea except forthe Kerch peninsula and Sevastopol. They are believed to be about 50 miles west of Kerch and to be making gradual progress. The garrison at Sevastopol isbelieved to be weaker than originally reported and, with the Germans little morethan 10 miles away, the port is in considerable danger.Conclusion.20. In spite of continued German progress on some parts of the front,the position as a whole is encouraging. The most serious threats exist in the Tulaarea, north of Rostov, and in the Crimea, and the ultimate danger to the Caucasusremains.Although the Russians may no longer be able to carry out any large-scaleoffensive operations, due to their heavy losses in artillery and A.F.V.&apos;s, there is every indication that they are still capable of prolonged fighting on the defensiveand appear to suffer from no shortage of aircraft.[231447 B 2
Operations.Libya.21. No operations other than patrol and raiding activities have taken placein the Tobruk or frontier areas.Enemy reinforcements, on a scale amounting to some 3,000 men since the1st October, are still going to Benghazi. Convoys to Tripoli were recentlyinaugurated afresh with disastrous results. The destruction of a large convoy,reported in paragraph 4 of the Naval Situation, will add considerably to the already serious Axis supply difficulties in North Africa.A abyssinia.22. In the Gondar area it has been confirmed that three enemy battalionshave been withdrawn from the area Gorgora-Celga (west of Gondar) to reinforce the line Meldiba-Deva (east of Gondar).In the area south-east of Gondar, the Wogera tribesmen have been raidingour lines of communication on the road Sardo-Bessie, and there was a half-hourengagement on the 29th October, resulting in about fifty of the enemy and ten ofour African troops being killed. There are also reports of inter-tribal fighting,in which some 200 tribesmen were killed, but the road is now stated to be cleartas the tribesmen have moved north-westwards towards Alomato.The Deputy Chief Political Officer confirms that the Emperor has undertaken to send Ras Seyum back to his province (Tigre) to deal with this unrest, but thereis still no information that he has left Addis Ababa.In the Galla Sidamo area our patrols have been attacked three times, andthere has been further raiding between Galla Sidamo and Boran. Ras AbabaAregai has reached Adola to relieve Bakala (the Emperor&apos;s representative whosemaladministration has been the cause of the trouble), but it is not yet known ifthe latter has left.Syria.23. The unrest in the Jezireh district of Syria is considerably abated, andthe fines of arms levied by the Joint Anglo-French Commission are being dulyreceived.Malaya.24. A convoy has arrived in Malaya with artillery units armed with 25-pdr.and 2-pdr. guns, which will enable three field regiments (including twoAustralian) and an Australian A/Tk. regiment to be re-equipped.A certain number of 18-pdrs., thus released, will be used for aerodromedefence, manned by the infantry garrisons.Intelligence.Balkan States.25. Recent reports show that the total number of German divisions in the balkans is still fourteen, but that the Germans have been obliged to increase their forces of occupation in Yugoslavia to seven.The revolt in Serbia is apparently meeting with greater opposition, as theGermans are believed to be operating against the insurgents with regular units in considerable force. Press reports indicate that in Serbia there has been fightingvery close to Belgrade itself and heavy casualties are reported on both sides. Inthe area south of Belgrade the Germans are continuing their systematic destruc-tion of Serbian towns and villages. Colonel Mihailovic, a former infantry officer on the staff of General Nedic, is said to be commanding the insurgents and to haverecently refused peace terms offered by the puppet Government., The Far East.26. Japanese military preparations in the south are continuing, though itis difficult at the moment to deduce whether these are for an attack on the burma road (the Kunming operation) or for eventual action against Thailand (Siam).
Japanese forces in the south are now estimated at ten divisions distributed as follows : Formosa : Two divisions.Hainan : One division.Canton : Three divisions.French Indo-China North (Tongking) : Two divisions.South : One division.AIR SITUATION.General Review.27. Operations were again hampered by bad weather, but on the night7th/8th November Bomber Command despatched the largest number of aircraftyet operated from this country on a single night.Fighter Command made successful attacks on objectives in Northern Franceand Belgium.28. In the Mediterranean our bombers operated on an increased scaleagainst enemy supplies in Libya, and against Naples and other towns in southern Italy.29.   Enemy activity against this country remained at a low level.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.30. Bomber Command despatched 11 Sorties compared with 32 last week.Fighter Command flew 633 sorties on offensive operations over occupied territory and against coastal shipping. Attacks on shipping are reported under &quot; CoastalOperations.&quot;31. A successful attack was made by Blenheims- on the Gosnay chemical works near Bethune, and four hits were scored on the main buildings.32. Several successful attacks were made by Hurricane bombers of fighter command. Eight Hurricanes bombed a factory near Bergues causing a largeexplosion, and six dropped all their bombs on an oil refinery at Beauchamps,near Le Treport, leaving the main buildings enveloped in smoke and flames.Eight others bombed the alcohol factory at St. Pol, setting the factory on fire and causing the Still tower to collapse. Hurricane bombers also attacked barges,lock gates and railway tracks near Nieuport, and railway bridges and electricpylons near Dieppe.33. Fighters attacked a variety of targets, including gasometers nearBergues and Middlekerke, one of which was set on fire, an oil refinery at Vertonin the Pas de Calais, and goods trains near Dieppe.34. During these operations our fighters destroyed 12 enemy aircraft.,probably destroyed eight and damaged 12. Our losses were 25 aircraft but threepilots were rescued.35. Enemy defensive activity by day was rather above the recent average,moderate to strong patrols being flown over the Pas de Calais area on five days of the week.Night.36. The activities of the three Commands were again considerably restricted by continued bad weather. All Bomber Command operations were cancelled on three nights of the week, and on two others they were considerably curtailed. Atotal of 647 sorties were flown, compared with 580 in the previous week, and684 tons of H.E. bombs and 44,156 incendiaries were dropped.37. On the night of 7th/8th November 400 aircraft, which is the largestforce of bombers to have operated from this country on a single night, were
despatched to attack targets in Germany and occupied territory. Very bad weather was encountered and 37 aircraft are missing.38. The heaviest attacks of the week were made on Berlin and Hamburg.Ninety-two tons of H.E. bombs and over 10,000 incendiaries were dropped onthe former and 96 tons of HE. bombs and 6,000 incendiaries on the latter. at berlin the weather was most unfavourable and no ground detail was visible.Bursts were, however, seen in the Neukoln and Tempelhof areas, and in thewest end of the city, where fires were started. At Hamburg the weather was good, but observation of results was difficult, owing to the glare of searchlights.Bursts were seen in the Blohm and Voss shipyards, in the dock area, and invarious parts of the city.39. A total of 185 tons of H.E. bombs was dropped on Cologne, Mannheimand Essen. Visibility was good at the two first-named towns, and bombs were seen to burst on railways and on the banks of the river.40. Raids on a lighter scale were made on the docks at Ostend, Dunkirk,Boulogne, Havre and St. Nazaire.41.   Havocs of Fighter Command bombed aerodromes in Northern France.United Kingdom.42.   Fighter Command flew 2089 sorties by day and 389 sorties by night.43. By day enemy activity continued at the normal level, and was directedprincipally against our coastal shipping, on which several attacks were made.A few aircraft crossed the coast, and bombs were- dropped on Seaham, and twotrains were attacked.44. On each of the first four nights of the period, between 40 and 60 long-range bombers were plotted. On one of these nights some aircraft attacked townsin the north-east, though the majority were engaged in anti-shipping activities.45. A few dive-bombers operated on three nights and attacked Dover andMargate.46. During the week our night fighters destroyed two enemy aircraft and damaged a third.Coastal Operations.47. Unfavourable weather considerably hampered operations against enemy shipping. Coastal Command flew 143 patrols (242 sorties) and provided 21convoy escorts (50 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols by fighter command totalled 417 (1,023 sorties).48. A Beaufort sank a merchant vessel of 900 tons off Den Helder. a merchant vessel of about 10,000 tons in convoy off Egersund was attacked by aHudson and two bombs were seen to hit the vessel forward of the bridge. AnotherHudson bombed an 800-ton trawler off the South Norwegian Coast and is believed to have obtained a hit.49. Two Spitfires of Fighter Command attacked a destroyer and a submarine off Flushing, both of which were hit by cannon fire.50. Twenty aircraft laid mines in Oslo Harbour, in the mouths of the ElbeJade and Weser, and off the Frisian Islands.Central Mediterranean.51. Reconnaissance aircraft from Malta maintained a constant search for enemy shipping in the Ionian Sea and between Sicily and Libya. They sightedthe convoy which was subsequently destroyed by a naval force, as reported underNaval Situation, and another east of Cotrone, consisting of two merchant ships of 2/3,000 tons and one destroyer. Twelve Blenheims were despatched the same day to attack the latter convoy, but only near misses resulted. On the following day further attacks were made by two forces of six Blenheims, and, in spite of heavy and accurate A.A. fire from the destroyer, which shot down two of our aircraft, both merchant ships were hit; one was left on fire, and the other was
abandoned by the crew. All the aircraft which attacked this convoy were hit byA.A. fire and in many cases seriously damaged.52. Four Swordfish are missing from a night search for two merchant ships which had been unsuccessfully attacked by Blenheims near Kerkennah on theprevious day.53. Two daylight attacks were made by a force of five Blenheims onhangars, workshops and buildings at Mellaha, east of Tripoli (L). Transportsheds were hit, many vehicles being destroyed, and a large petrol fire was started.54. Eleven Hurricane bombers with fighter protection made a successfuldaylight attack on Gela aerodrome, Sicily. At least one aircraft was destroyed on the ground and many others damaged. In this operation one Ju. 87 was shot down and two Hurricanes were lost. ,55. Naples was attacked on five nights of the week, twice by a force of about20 Wellingtons, and on the other occasions by a few single aircraft which madenuisance raids, lasting in some instances over six hours. Several 4,000-lb. bombs were dropped, and many hits were made on the railway centre and an airframeworks where fires were started. Hits were also made on what was probably a power station north of the city.56. A heavy night attack was made on Brindisi by 21 Wellingtons, which dropped 26 tons of H.E. and 4^ tons of incendiaries, hitting the aircraft factory,barracks, railway centre and torpedo-boat base. Other night attacks on a lighterscale were made on factories at Ragusa, the submarine base at Augusta, and onMessina, where bursts were seen across the power station. Naval Swordfish took part in some of these attacks.57. Italian aircraft were over Malta on most days and nights of the week.Five bombing attacks were made, but no serious damage or casualties resulted.A daylight raid was made by four bombers escorted by 18 fighters of the latesttype, three of which were destroyed, one probably destroyed and one damaged by Hurricanes; one Hurricane was lost.Eastern Mediterranean.58. During the week a day and night offensive was maintained against enemy aerodromes, stores, dumps and workshops in Cyrenaica.59. Two forces of six mary lands attacked Derna, where buildings near theM.T. workshops were hit. Both formations were attacked by enemy fighters andone Maryland was shot down, but an Me. 109 was destroyed and another was damaged. Over five tons of bombs were dropped on a dump near Benghazi, andthe majority were seen to burst in the target area. Other daylight sorties were flown by Maryland formations against targets at Berca, Binina and Benghazi,but owing to fighter opposition and bad weather no notable results were observed.60. One of two Fortresses which bombed Benghazi and Sollum was forceddown 60 miles west of Maddalena, where it was located after a protracted search.Supplies were dropped to the crew, who were subsequently rescued.61. Six Blenheim fighters made a successful attack on Jedabya aerodromeand destroyed two aircraft by cannon fire. The Jedabya-El Agheila road wastwice attacked, and many M.T. vehicles, including petrol tankers, were destroyed or damaged.62. During the week Benghazi was attacked at night by a total of 56Wellingtons. One raid started a large petrol fire on the Juliana Mole; anothercaused several explosions and very small fires at the base of the Central Mole,one particularly violent explosion following the burst of a 4,000-ib. bomb.63. Satisfactory results were observed from attacks on stores dumps atBerca, Bardia, Gazala and in the Tobruk area. Workshops and other targets atDerna were attacked by 45 Wellingtons.64. Our fighters and reconnaissance aircraft from Egypt were activethroughout the week, but there are no notable incidents to report.
65.   Enemy activity was on a normal scale, and attacks were made on our ground forces in the Tobruk and frontier sectors and on our coastal aerodromesbut with little effect.  A few bombs were dropped by night in the Canal Zone byreconnaissance aircraft.Greece.66. Supplies were successfully dropped by three Wellingtons from Egyptfor parties of Imperial troops still at liberty in three areas of Southern Greece.East Africa.67. Pressure was maintained against enemy positions in the Gondar area,and during the week 61 offensive sorties were flown by Wellesleys, and by fighters and bombers of the South African Air Force. No enemy aircraft were encountered.Russia.German Air Force Operations against Russia.68. Air operations have again been on a low scale on the Moscow front,the close support units based on forward aerodromes being particularly affectedby conditions which continue to make many of these unserviceable owing to mud.Long-range bombers are not thought to have been affected to the same extent,their bases being located a considerable distance behind the battle area withconsequently better facilities for aerodrome maintenance. Even so, what raidsthere have been on Moscow still appear to be only of a harassing nature.69. On the whole of the rest of the front, German Air Force activity hasbeen practically at a standstill except in the Crimea, where long-range and dive-bombers have heavily attacked Sebastopol and its harbour, and other towns and shipping along the coast of the Crimea.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.70. Bombing has been on a small scale and was confined to coastal areas.There was no serious damage of national importance.By Day.71. On the 10th November, for the first time since the 24th September,bombs were dropped on the mainland of Great Britain in broad daylight. Adirect hit was made on a train at Bempton, Yorkshire, and both lines were temporarily blocked.  Traffic was, however, resumed on the following day.Bombs also fell on the Skinningrove Iron Works at Saltburn and at NorthRepps near Cromer, causing only slight damage. The Flying Scotsman wasmachine-gunned in the Northumberland area, and a fireman injured.On the 12th November Seaham Harbour, Co. Durham, was bombed without serious result.By Night.72. Bombing took place on five nights of the week. On the 6th/7th Novembertwo parachute mines fell at Southend-on-Sea and minor incidents were reported from Dun ton in Essex and from Norfolk and Cornwall.On the following night many incidents were reported from the Tyne-Teesarea, and there was some concentration on Sunderland. Bombs were also dropped on Hull, Great Yarmouth, Margate and Dover.Dover was bombed twice on the 8th/9th and 5 people were killed at Alnmouth,Northumberland.On the 9th/10th there were two attacks on Margate and 3 people were killed.Bombs also fell at Ramsgate, Hartlepool Docks and King&apos;s Lynn.On the last night of the week bombs fell near Redruth, Cornwall.
Damage.73. At Southend-on-Sea on the 6th/7th parachute mines caused superficialbut widespread damage.On the 7th/8th slight damage was done at Sunder land to a railway and aquay in the dock area. The water-softening plant and stores at the power station were also hit, but output remains unaffected. Six people were killed and house property suffered considerably.There was also extensive damage to houses at Hull and Dover.During the two attacks on Margate on the 9th/ 10th a furniture depositorywas gutted and an hotel seriously damaged. There was also slight damage to some300 houses.Casualties.74. Casualties for the week ending 0600 on the 12th November are estimatedat 29 killed, 2 missing and 48 seriously injured.[23144]c

Air Attacks on Enemy Territory in Europe.Extracts from Recent Raid Assessment Reports.The following reports of damage have been received during the past week from Air Reconnaissance and Intelligence sources :  Germany.Berlin. The following account of the R.A.F. raid on Berlin on the night ofthe 7th/8th September was received from a neutral of known reliability whohappened to be travelling through Berlin and was there on the night when the raid occurred.The weather was clear and there was a full moon. The alarm sounded at23-30 hours and the all-clear was given at 03-50 hours.Each attack appeared to converge on the city from several directions.Searchlight and anti-aircraft fire indicated that at least four aircraft were attack-ing simultaneously in each wave. Anti-aircraft fire was very intense proving that the defences of Berlin are being maintained intact.Attacking aircraft which were outlined in searchlight beams appeared to betwin-engined bombers and were flying at what was estimated to be medium height fifteen to twenty thousand feet.Bombs fell in widely scattered parts of the &quot;city, and three rather large fires were started. The most serious of these was in the vicinity of the OstkreutzBahnhof where large warehouses are reported to have been destroyed. TheGerman press reported that between 100 and 150 bombs fell in the city. Thesebombs were apparently of medium size approximately 100 kg.The raid gave the impression of being determined and in force. It seemsagreed that it was one of the heaviest yet made on Berlin.It is believed that three British aircraft were shot down over the city. Ofthese, one was seen to be shot down by a night fighter.At about 00 - 30 hours a British bomber which was flying over theSiemenstadt area at approximately 15,000 feet was caught in the beams of aboutthirty searchlights. Then a large, deep red flare was seen. The anti-aircraft fire suddenly stopped and a few seconds later two bursts of tracer probably20 mm. cannon from a night fighter were seen, the second of which brought the bomber down.The light of the flare lasted for several seconds, and was so large that it looked almost as if another aircraft was on fire, and was so outstanding that noA.A. battery could miss it.It is also interesting to note that night fighters were employed so far inside the critical zones round the city. Presumably these night fighters are used, incertain sectors and in conformity with weather conditions, at extremely highaltitudes in order not to interfere with the fire of major calibre anti-aircraftartillery, particularly in barrage fire. When enemy bombers are illuminated andthe night fighter is in a favourable position to attack, the flare signal is given to stop the anti-aircraft fire.Cologne. four-fifths of the dye and colour works of Franz Rasquin, atMulheim, has been destroyed.Belgium.Antwerp. In the raid of the 3rd-4th October the Ford Works sufferedextensive damage as a result of hits by two H.E. and many incendiary bombs.Some of the most important machinery in this works was destroyed or damaged.Bombs also fell in the St. Anne district, and two buildings at the NavigationSchool were demolished.
Italy.Naples. An informant who recently visited the city, left under theimpression that the R.A.F. had carried out some excellent work. He observedthat the arsenal had suffered heavy damage, but owing to the closing of large areas of the city to the public he was unable to observe the greater part of the damage that had obviously been caused.Sea-Mining.On the 1st November the Swedish steamer Sigrid, of 1,091 tons, was mined and sank m the vicinity of Kiel Bay. She was employed in the Rotterdam coal trade.It is learnt that on the 18th August the train ferries across the Great Beltwere suspended and that minesweepers were active. Furthermore, the ferry fromSassnitz to Trelleborg was twice suspended between the 20th October and the endof the first week of November. In each case these suspensions are attributable to sea-mining activity.
