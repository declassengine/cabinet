THIS document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s governmentPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.Copy No.   29TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.MAN-POWER.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.IT may be a convenience to my colleagues if I set out the provisional views which I have formed on some of the major issues which we have to settle.1. The age of compulsory military service for men should be raised by tenyears, to include all men under 51. While this might not make very many men available for an active fighting role, it would assist the Minister of Labour in finding men for non-combatant duties in the Services.The possibility that the age should be raised again later on need not be excluded; but it would seem that an increase of ten years in the upper limit wouldbe sufficient at the moment.2. The case for calling up young men at 18^, instead of 19, seems fullyestablished. Indeed, I would go further, and call them up at 18 if this wouldmake any substantial contribution.3. On the whole, I am not yet satisfied, in view of the marked dislike of theprocess by their service men folk, that a case has been established for conscriptingwomen to join the Auxiliary Services at the present time. Voluntary recruitment for these Services should, however, be strongly encouraged. For the present, the advertising campaign to get women to join the Auxiliary Services should be confined to the A.T.S.[23114]SECRET.W.P- (41) 2S8.November 6, 1941.
4. Should the Cabinet decide in favour of compelling women to join the auxiliary Services, it is for consideration whether the method employedshould hot be by individual selection, rather than by calling up by age groups.The latter system would inevitably discourage women from joining up until theirage group was called.5. The campaign for directing women into the munitions industries shouldbe pressed forward. The existing powers should be used with greater intensity.This should be closely linked with measures to secure the utmost practicabledegree of concentration in the less essential industries and in such services asbanking, insurance and various types of commercial agencies.6. Employers might well be encouraged, in suitable cases, to make furtheruse of the services of married women in industry. This would often have to beon a part-time basis, and means must be found to ease the burden on women whoare prepared to perform a dual role.W. S. C.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1.
