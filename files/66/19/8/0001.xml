THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECRET.Copy No. 29W.P. (41) 233.October 8, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ACTION OF THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES IN occupied territories.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE to my colleagues a revised draft of the declaration whichit is proposed should be issued by ourselves and the Allied Governments on theaction of the German authorities in occupied territory. This draft takes accountof the discussion of the paper which I submitted on the 5th October(W.P. (41)233).A. E.Foreign Office, October 8, 1941.The Governments of the United Kingdom. &amp;c, and the Free french national Committee make the following declaration : 1. When the German invaders, in their lust for conquest, attacked andenslaved the various European countries now under the German yoke, they nodoubt hoped that the peoples of these countries, in the depths of their despair,would yield without resistance; would allow themselves to be pillaged and starvedin the name of Hitler&apos;s New Order; and would passively submit to the destructionof their national heritage.2. These hopes have been falsified. The German authorities now realise that they cannot destroy the souls of these peoples even though they may possessthemselves of their bodies, lands and possessions. Thus, thwarted in their plans,and alarmed at the intense and passionate hatred that they have aroused, theyare now in panic resorting to acts of undisguised terrorism and murder. Innocentpersons are held as hostages and murdered indiscriminately in alleged retaliationfor the action of patriots endeavouring to uphold their national independenceagainst the German oppressors. Germany, who has claimed &quot; living room&quot; forher own people, shows that this means expulsion and massacre of the inhabitants of the homeland. Germany, who has claimed colonies, shows that Germans canonly be established by the obliteration of the subjected race.Draft Declaration.11506   [22995]
3. The sound of battle has hardly died down when the firing squad takesup the fell work, and in the rear of the German armies there is the rattle of deathin Belgium, in Czechoslovakia, in France, in Greecel in the Netherlands, inLuxemburg, in Norway, in Poland, in Soviet Russia and in Yugoslavia.. these methods will not break the spirit of the enslaved peoples. But it is certain thatthey have earned for the German name scorn and disgust throughout the world,Each barbarity stiffens the will of these heroic peoples to endure and to resist.&quot;4. We therefore publicly declare that the brutalities which are beingcommitted in the occupied countries are contrary to the dictates of humanity; area reversion to barbarism; and will meet with sure retribution. To this end weare united in our resolve to win the freedom of the oppressed peoples and to execute justice. The methods of oppression and terror used by Hitler are such that many people, including the Germans and Italians, are ignorant of the fullfacts. When these things are known, world opinion will not allow the criminalsto escape just punishment for their crimes. The facts are being put on recordso that in due time the world may pronounce its judgment. With victory will come retribution.,90B&apos;i bajoeijxina aiij &apos;io norleiaaddo oda v/j baifeildBtfae od yju[5GG2S]   9051I
