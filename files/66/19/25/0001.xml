NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   Naval forces have bombarded enemy positions off the Libyan coast.An Italian U-Boat has been destroyed off the south-west coast of Portugal.Shipping losses have been light. ;..Northern Waters.2. On the 17th October a Russian submarine torpedoed and sank a 4,000-ton merchant ship 80 miles south-west of North Cape.Home Waters.3. It is estimated that 8,000 tons of enemy shipping has been sunk andover 20,000 tons damaged by our aircraft, details of which are given underAir Situation.North Atlantic.4. H.M. Destroyer Cossack and H.M.S. Arigioani (Fighter Catapult ship),escorting a homeward bound convoy from Gibraltar, were torpedoed by U-Boatsto the westward of Cape St. Vincent on the 23rd and 26th October respectively.The former sank on the 27th, one hundred survivors being rescued, but the latter is still afloat though unable to steam.No news has been received of H.M. Corvette Gladiolus, which was escortinga homeward bound convoy from Canada, and she must now be considered atotal loss.Mediterranean.5. Cruisers and destroyers of the Mediterranean Fleet have bombarded theBardia area and enemy positions near Tobruk. H.M. Minelayer Latona, carrying-military personnel and stores to Tobruk, was bombed and sunk 30 miles north ofBardia, and H.M. Destroyer Hero was damaged while carrying out rescue work.Twenty-six officers and ratings in H.M.S. Latona and seven military other ranksare missing.H.M. Submarine Urge has reported that she torpedoed two ships off KuriatIsland on the coast of Tunis.The British s.s. City of Lincoln and s.s. Dunedin Star have arrived at gibraltar from Malta after having been unsuccessfully attacked on three occasionsby enemy aircraft, two of which were probably, damaged. Air reconnaissancehas failed to locate the s.s. Empire Guillemot (5,720 tons), which sailed from malta to Gibraltar on the 22nd, and she may have been sunk by Italian torpedoaircraft off the Algerian coast.During the week nine French merchant ships (39,800 tons) westbound andten (upwards of 33,000 tons) eastbound, have passed the Straits of Gibraltarunder escort. Three of the westbound ships carried lorries on deck. A fleetoiler and an armed transport passed eastbound on the 29th.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. H.M. Destroyer Lamerton, escorting a homeward bound Gibraltarconvoy, carried out a promising attack on a U-boat about 120 miles west of cape St. Vincent, and on the following day sank the Italian U-boat Ferraris by gunfire. Over fifty of the crew were taken prisoner. Four other attacks, threeby H.M. Destroyer Duncan and one by a Catalina flying boat, were carried outnear the convoy without definite result. Other attacks by surface craft took placesouth of Cape Race, north of the Belle Isle Straits and to the west of the cape verde Islands.Hits were claimed in two attacks by aircraft south of Iceland (C) and in theWestern Approaches, and six other attacks were carried out without visibleresults.H.M. Canadian Corvette Pictou reported that on the 17th October she hadchased a U-boat on the surface in the west Atlantic, and had carried out a promising attack while the U-boat was crash-diving.
Enemy Intelligence.7&apos; ,T?erue i!,ncL?hanFe7 ^ fche Positions of the enemy main units, except thatthe pocket battleship Admiral Scheer was not seen at Hamburg on the25th October, and there is evidence that she is now in the Western Baltic It isbelieved that the new battleship Tirpitz is also in the Western Baltic TheCatapult ships Friesenland and Westfalen were seen during the week at Trondheim; the latter has been there for some time and is thought to be the seaplanedepot ship at that port. It is considered possible that the Friesenland may begoing further north to establish a seaplane base in preparation for the time whenwinter weather conditions make the operations of shore-based aircraft difficult in these parts.No fast troop convoys have sailed from Ita.lv to North Africa since the18th of September.   Up to that date they had been running every fortnightIn general the traffic to Libya has shown a marked falling off in the past month.U-Boats.8. More than thirty U-Boats have been operating during the week Anumber of U-Boats have been reported north of the Belle Isle Straits and a laro-egroup which was situated in a wide area to the south-east of Greenland has nowdispersed. Another group, including two or three Italians, has been operating on the convoy route northwards from Gibraltar and others have been reportedoff Freetown, in the St. Helena area and in the approaches to the White SeaEnemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.9. During the week U-Boats, assisted by Focke-Wulf reconnaissance, havemade repeated attacks on a homeward bound convoy from Gibraltar, resulting in the loss of four ships.The British s.s. Corabella (5,682 tons) on passage from Takoradi to Pepelwas attacked by a U-Boat to the westward of Takoracli. After an engagementlasting two hours the U-Boat submerged and broke off the action.Two ships in a coastal convoy were bombed and sunk off the East Coast, andone ship was sunk by aircraft off the south-west coast of Spain.The British m.v. Georgia (27.759 tons) which was considered to be a total lossas the result of an air attack in Suez Bay during July, has been refloated.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending the 29th October 886 ships, including175 Allied and 24 neutral, were convoyed. Nine anti-aircraft ships, 113 destroyers(including 24 United States destroyers), and 117 sloops, corvettes and mine-sweepers were employed on escort duties. Since the beginning of the war 86,687ships have been convoyed, of which 451 have been lost by enemy action. Duringthe month of September, 4,341 ships were convoyed, of which 36 were lost.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the25th October were 1,435,869 tons, compared with 789,286 tons during the previous seven days, and an average of 1,011,921 tons during the past ten weeks.Imports of oil were 545,283 tons in 48 tankers. Mineral imports were297,319 tons, of which 173,899 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore.Timber and pulp imports were 54,307 tons and copra and palm oil 12,402 tons.Cereal imports amounted to 146,653 tons. There were 10,000 tons of rice. other food imports totalled 207,551 tons, of which 80,372 tons were sugar and molasses.The other principal commodities in tons were : refrigerated and tinned meats,bacon and ham 33,854, fruit 23,493 (including 1,267 tons of oranges), evaporatedmilk 10,694, cheese 9,189, lard and cooking fats 7,879, butter 5,763, tea 3,814,jam and honey 2,349. There were also 9,712 tons of unspecified tinned goods.Tobacco imports totalled 3,271 tons. An oil refinery ship brought 8,575 tons ofwhale oil. Imports of cotton, wool, hides, machinery and war stores were satisfactory.[23086] B
British Minelaying.11. During the week mines have been laid off the French Channel coastMinelaying by aircraft has been on a small scale and mainly confined to theBaltic.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping\12. Minelaying by enemy aircraft has been mainly in the Bristol channel and aircraft have been reported operating in Liverpool Bay. Except for four aircraft operating off Orfordness on one night in the week, no minelaying hastaken place off the East Coast.Four magnetic and thirteen acoustic mines have been destroyed during theweek. The mine totals to date are : Magnetic 1,489; acoustic 1,143, and contact1,063.Enemy Merchant Shipping.13. The Italian Eugenic- C. (4,078 tons) and German Joao Pessoa(3,023 tons) have joined the ore trade between Bilbao and Bayonne.The German Quito (1,230 tons) arrived at Shanghai on the 27th October. Shewas flying the Japanese flag and has been renamed the Tenchitsu Marti.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is included in this resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Finland.14. During the past week the enemy has slightly extended his front along the River Svir eastwards towards Lake Onega. Otherwise the situation remains unchanged.Leningrad Sector.15. Russian forces have been counter-attacking, and German pressure onthe city has somewhat decreased. The Germans have secured a bridgehead overthe River Volkhov and have made some advance towards the east.Kalinin Area.16. The Germans in this area are still meeting with very stubborn russian resistance. The Russians have delivered a number of counter-attacks, andGerman attempts to extend the salient to the north-west and north-east have had little success.Central Sector.17. West and south-west of Moscow the Germans have made some progress,but their advance continues to be hampered by Russian resistance, bad roads, andadverse weather conditions. The chief threat to the city appears at the moment to be from the Maloyaroslavets area, where fierce fighting has been reportedthroughout the week. Further south some progress has been made eastwards ofKaluga, but around Mzensk the situation remains substantially unchanged.Ukraine and Crimea.18. The Germans have occupied Byelgorod and Kharkov. These successeshave enabled the Germans to drive a substantial wedge into the Russian line,but there is reason to believe that the Soviet forces in this area succeeded mwithdrawing in good order.19. A serious threat has developed against the industrial region of theDonetz Basin, and the important manufacturing city of Stalino is in german hands.   The German drive on Rostov continues, but strong Russian resistance is
delaying the investment of the town. In spite of continued pressure on the approaches to the Crimea there is as yet no evidence of a break in the Russiandefences.Conclusions.20. Although the Russians have had to give ground east of the RiverVolkhov and the German spearheads are dangerously close to Moscow, the slow progress of the German advance on the northern and central fronts is encouraging.In the Ukraine however German pressure has been intensified, and the lossof part of the Donetz Basin constitutes a severe blow to the Russians. The driveon Bostov, although here, too, the Germans are having to contend with weather and supply difficulties, raised in an acute form the possibility of a further advanceacross the Don, either on Astrakhan, or more probably towards the Caucasus.Operations.Libya and Egypt.21. The garrison of Tobruk have continued their offensive patrolling andhave inflicted considerable casualties on the enemy. Enemy shelling wascontinuous throughout the week and was particularly heavy on the 25th October,when 267 rounds were fired in the western sector, 187 in the southern sector and181 in the eastern sector. The damage has, however, been slight, and there is evidence that our counter battery-fire has been effective.22. Operations in the frontier area have been confined to patrolling activity and two artillery duels in the neighbourhood of the Halfaya pass.East Africa.23. In Northern Abyssinia our patrols, in conjunction with patriot forces,have been in contact with the enemy in the Ambazzo area, 10 miles north ofGondar, where considerable opposition was encountered. An important tribalchief in this area has joined the patriots with his followers.24. In Southern Abyssinia dissatisfaction at the conduct of the Emperor&apos;representative, who is now being relieved, has caused unrest in the Adola areaof the Galla Sidamo. West of the lakes, a band of 1,500 ex-Italian irregularsand native bandits attacked the village of Baco on the night of 16th/17th October,causing heavy casualties among the native inhabitants:25. In the French Somaliland frontier area, a further 130 refugees crossed the frontier from Vichy French territory during the week ending 24th October.A rumour emanating from Vichy French sources to the effect that British and free French troops had entered French Somaliland north-west of Tajura was entirely without foundation. A rising of disaffected tribesmen in the area, dueto the removal of their food supplies to Jibuti, may have had some connectionwith the alleged incident.Persia.26. Our troops are now disposed to protect the oilfields and main supplyroutes to Russia.Intelligence.France.27. Reports on train movements show that numerous small batches ofGerman troops from various parts of France have been moved to Germany, andpossibly further east, during the last few weeks. At the same time, the firstreliable reports have been received of the presence in France of troops from theEastern front. It is thus clear that the Germans are obliged to make use of eventhe low-category garrison troops from occupied territories, replacing them tosome extent by tired units from Russia.28. It has been reported that one German division has now left south-westFrance, and the German forces between the River Gironde and the Spanishfrontier are therefore believed to consist of four infantry divisions.[23086] B 2
Italy.29. One Mobile Division previously believed to be in Russia is now knownto be still in Yugoslavia. There are four Italian divisions identified in Russia(two lorry-borne, one alpine and one mobile), a black shirt group and an armouredgroup.   The total strength may be 80-100,000.30. It is known that the Italian forces took part in the capture of Stalinoand they are now believed to be advancing eastward. The role of the Italiansin these operations so far appears to have been secondary; their task appears tohave been to follow up the German attack and there is no evidence that then-casualties have been at all heavy.31. The transport and supply situation continues to be serious. motor transport has had to a large extent to be abandoned, and there is a shortage of horse-drawn transport. The 52nd Division, for example, which is in theory lorry-borne, is reported already to have marched over 600 miles. i.e., almost all the way from their detraining point in eastern Roumania. These difficulties are not likely to diminish.Far East.32. In the North Japanese forces in Manchukuo have recently been increasedby two divisions from Central China and one division from Korea.  -This increases the number of Japanese forces in the North by two divisions,the present dispositions being :  Divisions.Manchukuo        ...      ...       ...       ...      ...      26N. Korea......      ...      ......        1Sakhalin ...      ...      ...       ...      ....        229There are also 8 divisions in Japan and 4 divisions in North China whichcould soon be made available if required for operations.The strategical situation vis-a-vis the Russians is not appreciably altered.33. In the South it is reported that, since October 18th, 12,000 japanese troops have arrived at Haiphong, and that a considerable quantity of railway material, stores and oil have been disembarked from transports which are arriving at an average of 3 a day. The destination of material and oil is believed to beLangson and Laokai, important stations on the Tongking Chinese frontier. Anunspecified number of ALT. and tanks are also reported to have landed at Saigonand to have left for Cambodia.34. These reinforcements probably do not indicate an immediate threat toThailand or to Yunnan, but the possibility of an operation, at a later date, fromTongking to cut the Burma Road cannot be ignored. Such an operation would presumably be directed against Kunming, and from the maintenance view-point would be a very hazardous operation. However, the rainy season is now over,and recent experience in Europe has shown that it is not wise to place undueemphasis on topographical difficulties.35. The present Japanese strength in Tongking is approximately one division and one Brigade plus ancillary troops, a total of 24,000. Before anyoperations against Kunming are attempted it is estimated the Japanese would increase this force to approximately five Divisions.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. Night bombing operations against enemy objectives in Germany and occupied Territory were again restricted by unfavourable weather.Successful attacks were made on enemy shipping in Home Waters.Enemy activity against this country remained at a low level.
Gei&apos;many and Occupied Territory.day.37. Bomber Command despatched 48 sorties compared with 49 last week.Jfohter Command flew 461 sorties in course of offensive operations over occupied territory and against shipping. Attacks on shipping are reported under&quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;38. Unfavourable weather conditions considerably hampered operations bythe Blenheims. A successful attack was, however, made on the aerodrome atLannion and hits scored on the runway.39. Aircraft of Fighter Command had many successes against targets inNorthern France and Belgium. During a sweep over the Cherbourg PeninsulaSpitfires attacked -an ammunition dump, a goods train, and a large factory atCaudreville. The seaplane base at Ostend was also attacked by eight Hurricanes,which destroyed two seaplanes and damaged another. Four Spitfires destroyeda Me. 109 on the ground at Berck and scored hits on barges and on three factoriesnear Dunkirk. Among other targets attacked were a power station and goodstrains near Boulogne, barges near Nieuport and Bruges, goods trains at St. Lo(south of Cherbourg), aircraft on the ground at Morlaix aerodrome, and the gestapo headquarters at Chateau de Courcey in Normandy.40. During the week our fighters destroyed 19 enemy aircraft, probably destroyed eight, and damaged seven. Our losses were 14 aircraft with one pilotrescued.41. Enemy defensive activity by day was on a small scale except on two occasions.Night.42. Unfavourable weather hindered the activities of the three Commands.All operations of Bomber Command were cancelled on two nights and on two others they were considerably curtailed. Only 473 sorties were despatched corn-pared with 715 in the previous week. A total of 452 tons of HE. bombs and27,564 incendiaries were dropped. The principal objectives were docks and ship-yards in France and Germany and the industrial centre of Frankfurt.43. The heaviest attacks of the week were made on Kiel and Flamburg, on each of which more than 90 tons of H.E. bombs and about 8,000 incendiaries were dropped. In the first phase of the attack on Kiel few results were observedbecause of thick cloud, but later visibility was good and bursts were seen in or near the Deutsche Werke and the Germania Works, where several fires were started. At Hamburg bursts were seen in the Blohm and Voss Shipyards, in the dock area and on the main railway station. There were numerous fires, especiallyaround the Aussen Alster.44. The attack on Frankfurt was seriously hampered by bad weather con-ditions and many aircraft despatched on this task were unable to identify thetown.45. The German battle cruisers at Brest were attacked on three nights by atotal of 13 Stirlings and 16 Wellingtons, which released 78 tons of H.E. bombs,including thirty-five 2,000-lb. bombs. On the first two nights visibility was poorbecause of cloud and an effective smoke screen, but some aircraft were able to identify certain ground features and bomb the estimated positions of the ships.On the third night visibility was good and bursts were seen across the docks wherethe battle cruisers are berthed.46. Ten Stirlings were despatched to attack the Skoda Works at Pilsen,They encountered very cloudy weather throughout the outward and returnjourneys and failed to identify their objective.47. During these night operations a number of other targets were attacked,including the docks at Emden, Havre and Cherbourg, and the aerodrome atSchipol.
48. Beauforts of Coastal Command attacked docks and shippino- atEgersund and the harbour at Aalesund in Norway. A W/T Station was hit and a fish oil factory was set on fire. Other Beauforts attacked land targets atNantes.49. Havocs of Fighter Command bombed several aerodromes in northern france.United Kingdom.50.   Fighter Command flew 2,126 sorties by day and 406 sorties by night.51&quot;. Enemy activity by day was on a small scale, and was confined to anti-shipping flights, principally off the East Coast, and to weather reconnaissances.Two enemy bombers were destroyed by our fighters off the East Coast.52. Enemy activity by night was on an equally small scale, and wasprincipally directed against shipping off the East and South-West Coasts, thoughthe Mersey district was the apparent objective of a force of about 12 bomberson two nights.  Enemy night fighters did not operate.53.   Our night fighters destroyed two and damaged four enemy aircraft during the week.Coastal Operations.54. Coastal Command flew 213 patrols (337 sorties) and provided 36 convoy escorts (142 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols by Fighter Commandtotalled 473 (1,002 sorties).55. A successful attack on shipping off Aalesund in Norway was made bynine Hudsons. Seven ships, including an escort vessel, were hit, and of these,two merchant vessels of 5,000 and 3.000 tons were sunk, and a third of 2,000 tons was severely damaged. A convoy off Terschelling was attacked by six Hudsons.A 10,000 ton merchant ship in the convoy was hit twice in the stern, a second of2,500 tons was hit amidships and another of 3,000 tons was set on fire. Anotherconvoy off the Dutch Coast was attacked by two tludsons, and a merchant vessel of 2,000 tons was hit. Two merchant vessels off Egersund in Norway were bombed by Beauforts and both were set on fire. Several other attacks were madeon shipping, but results were not observed.56.   Spitfires of Fighter Command attacked a 2,000 ton cargo vessel off Caen,a flak-ship off the Dutch Coast and a tug outside Calais Harbour.57.   Seven aircraft laid mines in Kiel Harbour, in the mouth of the Weserand off St. Nazaire.58. Minelaying operations by enemy aircraft were undertaken on mostnights of the week, in Liverpool Bay, the Bristol Channel and off the NorfolkCoast.Central Mediterranean.59. Blenheims from Malta made a number of daylight attacks on objectives in Italy, Sicily and Tripoli (L). Although reconnaissances and sweeps were flown in search of shipping, no convoys were located, and there are no reports ofthe successful attacks which have been a feature of our operations in the central mediterranean in the past.  Night attacks were made on Naples and Tripoli (L).   \60. On two days a total of 16 Blenheims, after an unsuccessful search for shipping in the Gulf of Taranto, attacked targets in Southern Italy. A goodstrain at Cotrone was destroyed, and hits were seen on the railway line and on several bridges. At Cantanzaro, factory buildings, sidings and a pumping station were hit, resulting in a large fire accompanied by dense clouds of black smoke,probably from burning oil. Bombs also fell on. factories at Locari and Siderno,where the gas works were hit and a large fire broke out. Five Blenheims bombedLicata, Sicily, and all bombs were seen to burst in the target area. Six Hurn-canes also attacked a factory and railway sidings at Ftagusa.
61. Twenty Blenheim sorties were flown over the African coast. Theprincipal objectives were Misurata, the coast road and an enemy camp. Accurateobservation of results was generally impossible, but a building at Buerat was seen to be demolished, and two fighters Avere damaged on the ground at Zuara.62. Two night attacks were made on Naples by a small force of Wellingtons,but weather was bad and no results were observed.63. Tripoli (L) was attacked on five nights of the week by a total of 36Wellingtons. Several sustained attacks were made, lasting on one occasion for fivehours and on another for eight. Hits were seen on the moles, seaplane station andon the railway yards, where there was a large explosion and fires broke out.64. Government and civilian property in Malta was slightly damagedduring a night attack by four Italian aircraft. A daylight raid by four bombers,preceded by 27 fighters, resulted in a fuel dump being set on fire and other minor damage. One enemy fighter wras destroyed and a bomber and a fighter severely damaged; one Hurricane was lost.Eastern Mediterranean.65. Light bombers of the R.A.F. and South African Air Force made manydaylight attacks on targets in the frontier area, and two successful attacks onBenghazi, which was also attacked nightly.66. Enemy aerodromes at Derna and El Gazala were attacked by a totalof 15 mary lands. At the latter two enemy aircraft were destroyed and a largefire broke out, while at Derna bursts were seen among aircraft, but further results could not be observed. Benghazi was bombed by 17 mary lands, bursts beingseen near buildings on Juliana point, and on official buildings, railway sidingsand workshops, where a fire was started; some of our aircraft were damaged by A.A. fire and by fighters. Fuel and ammunition dumps at Gambut were also attacked. Wellingtons flew 23 night bombing sorties against Benghazi andbursts were seen at various points in the harbour district. On the night of the25th/26th Blenheim fighters attacked a column of M.T. on the Jedabya-El Agheila road, damaging a petrol tanker and many other vehicles.67. Fighters provided protection for our coastal shipping, and carried outtwo offensive patrols in the Tobruk and frontier areas. On one occasion no opposition was encountered, but on the other three Me. 109s were destroyed;we lost two Hurricanes, but both pilots are safe.68. Reconnaissance flights were made over Athens and Crete, and in searchof shipping between Crete and the African coast.69. Enemy activity was less than last week. Attacks were made on Tobrukboth by day and night; an empty lighter was sunk and two small fires were started in an advance ordnance depot. One night attack was made on the Deltaarea, when about ten enemy aircraft bombed the Lake Mariut District, butresults were negligible. By day a few bombs were dropped at Kufra, and single aircraft reconnoitred the Delta, coastal aerodromes and Jarabub.Gibraltar.70. Catalina flying-boats flew 19 sorties on anti-submarine patrols andconvoy escort duties.West Africa.71.   The usual convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols were flown.Aden.72. Aircraft from Aden flew many patrols over Jibuti, Obock and theFrench Somaliland frontier.
East Africa.73. Aircraft of the South-African Air Force made many bombing and machine-gun attacks on enemy positions in the Gondar area. A Gladiator shot down an Italian fighter in flames 30 miles N.E. of Gondar.Russia.German Air Force Operations.74. Bad weather conditions and soft landing grounds continue to affect air operations on the Moscow front, but both sides have taken advantage of fineperiods to operate on an intensive scale. Long-range bombers have made heaviernight attacks on Moscow than hitherto.75. In the Southern Sector the Germans have made important advances inthe Donetz basin, but the main weight of air attack has been concentrated againstthe Crimea, without, however, achieving substantial progress. On the southern part of the front the G.A.F., with reduced forces due to reinforcementswithdrawn to the Central Section, has received considerable support from italian, Hungarian and other detachments, mostly consisting of fighter and reconnaissance units.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.76.   No bombs were dropped on land in daylight.By night on the 27th/28th no bombs were dropped, and on the 23rd/24th afew bombs only were dropped north of Tnvergordon. On other nights scatteredbombing was confined almost exclusively to Cheshire, Wales, the South-WestCounties of England and the Coast of East AngliaDamage.77. Such damage as resulted was largely the result of blast from parachutemines. At Altrincham on the 25th/26th two mines caused superficial damage to six important factories, involving temporary delay to production while roof and minor structural repairs were being effected. There was some dislocation of gas,water and telephone services and 8 fatal casualties. At Chester the canal banksuffered some damage.Casualties.78. Casualties for the week ending 0600 on the 29th October are estimatedat 21 killed and 39 seriously injured.

In combining thefigures for non-tankers (which are compiled as at the end of the month) with those for tankers (which are compiled as at the 15th of the month) certain slight differenceshave had to be brought into a common form.(1) (a) These comprised 43 tankers of 349,000 gross tons.(b) Non-tankers allocated to the righting services which are under repair are excluded from this column.   All tankers on Admiralty service are, however, included.(c) A substantial part of the tonnage in these columns brings commercial cargoes to the United Kingdom on completion of the outward voyage, e.g., to the middle east (see note 3).(d) In recent months the proportion of this tonnage which did no importing to the United Kingdom (Armed Merchant Cruisers, Eoyal Fleet Auxiliaries, hospital ships, &amp;c.) has amounted to rather more than one-half.(2) These columns give vessels out of employment (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service), being mainly those immobilised by damage or repair. They do not,therefore, include vessels under repair while loading or unloading cargo.(3) These columns include vessels (apart from tankers on Admiralty Service) which are bringing imports to the United Kingdom but which were allocated on the outward voyages to the Fighting Services or which had previously been trading between countries other than United Kingdom and Eire.
