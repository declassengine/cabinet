CYPHER TELEGRAM.prom:    Dominions Office.jo:        The Governments of Canada, Ooniiuonwealth of Australia,,New Zealandj  and to the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in the Union of South Africa.(Sent 11 pan. 27th October, 1941;IMPORTANT.M. No. 34 i      MO 3 1 3 EG SI. T.Following for Prime minister.    Begina.We nave recently been considering our ieiations withFinland, Hungary and Soumania.    In a message to Stalin delivered by Sir. 3. Cripps on the 6th Septemoer the Prime Minister said&quot;we are willing to put any pressure upon Finland in our power,including immediate intimation tiiat we will declare war upon them if tney continue beyond the old frontiers1&apos; .    In reporting on his interview with Stalin after the delivery of tnis messageSir S. Cripps said that Stalin would,  of course, like us to declare war on Finland at once.2. On the 17th October&apos; the Soviet Ambassador delivered tothe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs a message from Ivi.Molotov to the effect that trie Soviet Government would appreciatit if we could see our way to declare war on F&apos;inlands roumania and Hungary.    He repeated tnis message with great emphasis onthe2lst October and pressed very urgently for a favourable reply.3. It is clear that the Soviet Government attach verygreat importance to our acceding to this request and we naturallyare anxious not to rebuff or discourage them when at thiscritical juncture they ask us to make a gesture of this kind. a refusal might arouse their latent suspicions as to our motives.There are, however,  certain practical considerations which mustbe taken into account.      These can be summarised as follows:-4. As regards all three countries a British declaration ofwar would make it easier for Germany,  if she so desires at alater stage to force those countries to allow their troops tobe used in operations against British forces.      Moreover, as wehave taken all practical measures that are taken on declarationof war except for the internment of Finns, Hungarians andRoumanians in tnis country;  a declaration of war would have no practical effect of a beneficial nature.FINLAND.5.    (a; A declaration of war might well drive the Finns,including those who dislike the Germans and do not want openconflict with us, further into the German arms.    The threatcontained in our recent message  (see ray telegram D.No.  582 of25th September)  to &apos;&apos; treat Finland as an open enemy,  not onlywhile the war lasts but also when peace comes to be made&quot; isonly effective while it remains a threat.(b) Certain difficulties would arise in regard to shipping, viz.-

(i) We should forfeit our chances of getting twenty-seven ships now In North and South American waters fortne North Atlantic^ which we ax-e attempting to navetaken over by the Swedes who would charttr them tous.    If we declare wars wt could only expect thatafter long delays these ships might be employed in trade useful to the Americans,(ii) we might cause some dislocation to United Statestrade,  for we nave been shepherding these ships intothis trade by arrangement with the United StatesMari time Commis si on,(iii) we should lose some Finnish crews.(c) We anticipate that a declaration of war would bedistasteful to that body of American opinion which is favourable to the Finns.    Moreover., we should be diverging from theAmerican policy of attempting to  exploit the  difference ofopinion which tne United States Government believe exists in finland in regard to continuing aggiessive action on Sovietterritory (see my telegram of 9tn October9 D. No.609).HUNGARY.6. A declaration of war on Hungary would please the yugoslav Government;, since Hungary has invaded Yugoslavterritory, and it might cause pleasure in Czechoslovak quartersOn trie otner tiand,  it might be less welcome to Poland9 whoattaches importance to her relations with Hungary after the warRQUMANIA.It Roumania and Hungary must be considered together,  sothat no favouritism is snowa to one or the other&apos;s claim toTransylvania.    Yugoslavs attach importance to reconstruction of a strong Roumania and would probably prefer us not to goto war with her.    Nor would declaration of war be welcome to greece or Turkey.Furthermore9 if war were declared on Roumania and hungary,, the Greek and Yugoslav Governments would press for similar action in regard to Bulgaria,, who has seized portions of their territory and is massacring Greek subjects.    Unlesspressed by the Soviet Government to declare war on Bulgaria(and they have not made this request).. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould not wish to do so, principally because it would probablycause the Turkish Government some displeasure.    Such a request by the Greek and Yugoslav Governments woulda therefore9 be refused.    The question of Bulgaria need not,  therefore9influence the decision regarding a declaration of war onRoumania and Hungary.8. Identical action by all British commonwealth governments is clearly necessary and we should therefore beglad for views of your Government at earliest possible moment.We are also obtaining views of United States Government.Ends.

From SOUTH AFRICA to DOMINIONS OFFICE.D. 29th October, 1941, 4.45 p,m.R.  29th       &quot; &quot;      9.07 p.m.IMPORTANT.No.  13io MOST SECRET.Your M. No. 341 28th October- Following for PrimeMinister.    Begins,/        Union Government are well content to leave decision of;. this knotty question to United Kingdom Government inconsultation with United States Government.     We desire to add following general observations.1,    Practice of undeclared war in cases of complicated andconflicting considerations is becoming common in internationalpractice and we do not see why Soviet Government should force (a) declaration on us in cases of Finland, Hungary, and Roumania,Finland especially has many sympathisers as Russians startedthe trouble by attacking Finland in collusion with Germany.2.   Apart from present practical considerations set forth in your telegram question is important for its possible bearing on the future peace. &apos;   If we declare war on these countriesRussia will,  in our eventual victory,  insist on their be ingtreated as declared enemies and may claim their absorption inpart-, or in whole, as she has already dealt with Finland andother Baltic states *      The embarrassment for us in the making of peace may thus be largely increased.      We assume that forsake of a future peaceful Europe principle of nationality willhave to be followed at the peace to fullest extent practicable and Russian claims of absorption may have to be strongly resisted.      Future grouping of nations in Europe should followeconomic interests and not involve annexations.3.    Even larger questions arise in regard to the future inthe case of our Allied victory,      Russia will emerge as thegreat power in Europe with Japan and Germany possibly down and out.     We may then have to favour a reconstituted Germany as acounterweight to Russian predominance.      This again would raise issued of enormous difficulty and importance.      We mayhave to oppose Russian claims not only upon principle of nationality but also for sake of future world peace and ourown security.     And this may very much increase alreadydifficult question of peace-making.Our feeling therefore inclines towards temporising withthe Russian demands and making- use of United StatesGovernment for that purpose.     We recognise however paramount importance of maintaining Russian ?good feeling especially atthe present critical phase of war and we leave decision to united Kingdom Government who have fuller grasp of whole situation both as regards the present and the future.

FROM THE GOVERNMENT  OP NEW ZEALAND TO DOMINIONS OFFICE.D. 30th October, 1941. 11,58 p0rruR.  30th       &quot; &quot; 6,50 pam0IMPORTANT.No*  451 MOST SECRET.Addressed to Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsNo, 451 repeated to Prime Minister of Canada No?   11,  PrimeMinister in the Union of South Africa No.   13, Prime minister in the Commonwealth of Australia No.  337.His Majesty1 s Government in New Zealand have giver-careful consideration to the questions raised in yourtelegram M. No,  341 of 28th Octoter,2.    They attach the utmost importance to our ttilcing, atthis time, any action within our powor which might have theeffect of encouraging the Soviet Government and they would regard it as extremely undesirable,  in the words of yourtelegram,  &quot;to rebuff or discourage them when at this criticaljuncture they ask us to make the gesture of this kind&quot;.They feel, therefore,  that the Governments of the BritishCommonwealth should as far,as possible accede to the Russianrequests, particularly having regard to the fact that our inability to relieve, by armed intervention,  the presentheavily pressed Soviet has necessarily created, disappointmentand,  indeed, some misgiving both in Russia and in the BritishCommonwealth itself.3,    Hungary and Roumania,  in the opinion of the NewZealand Government, are definitely in the enemy camp and willbe used by the Germans against us if, when, and to extent that,  circumstances seem to them propitious for such course.To all intents and purposes they are at war with us and theNew Zealand Government do not feel that a declaration on our part that we are at war with them is likely to alter theposition materially or detrimentally to affect our cause.They consider,  therefore,  that it would be both possible and proper to accede to the Russian request so far as those two countries are concerned.,4,    Finland.,  it seems to them,  is in a different category.Quite apart from the considerations set out in paragraph 5 of telegram under reply (many of which, and particularly theeffect upon the United States opinion, are of great force)they feel that the attempt by the Finns to recover theTerritory lost by them to the Russians last year when thesympathies of practically the whole world,  including theBritish Commonwealth,  were with the Finns, should not initself lead us into war with Finland ever, though we are atpresent allied to Russia.      If the information (set out inparagraph 8 of your telegram D. No. 647 of 27th October)that the Finnish objective is now to be limited is in

cor-sonancc with the facts then a declaration of war against Finland by the British Commonwealth governments might well lead to renewed activities by the Finns and thusoe,  in fact, detrimental to the Russian cause in the mostdirect sense.     Again, an early declaration of war by theBritish Commonwealth against Hungary and Roumania might initself strengthen any Finnish intention to take no furtheroffensive action against Russia.      In the opinion of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in Hew Zealand it is not desirable atthe present juncture to declare war against Finland and an endeavour should be made to persuade the RussianGovernment that this course would at present be undesirable.Should the Russians however attach primary importance tothis action and persist in their request then the NewZealand Government feel that the matter should again beconsidered.5,    The New Zealand Government agree that to declare war against Hungary and Roumania and not against Bulgariawould be logically inconsistent but as the action atpresent contemplated is the result of a request by theSoviet Government, who have made no such suggest ion-concerning Bulgaria, His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealandagree with the comment in paragraph 7 of the telegram M.No. 54-1 that &quot;the question of Bulgaria need not thereforeinfluence the decision regarding a declaration of war onRoumania and Hungary&quot; and feel that this ouestion shouldbe left for decision as and when the need for a decisionarises.6.    Finally, His Majesty&apos;s Government in New Zealandagree with the necessity of all British commonwealth governments taking identical action in this matter andwill be grateful to be informed in due course of the viewsof other British Governments and also of the Government ofthe United States of America.

FROM THE GOVERNMENT OP THE COMMONWEALTH OFAUSTRALIA TO DOMINIONS OFFICEaD. 31st October, 1941 12,50 a,m,R*    30th       &quot; &quot;        7.5   p.m.immediate no.  708 MOST SECRET,Commonwealth War Cabinet has carefully consideredyour telegram M* No, 341.      Its views are in brief thatI  the disadvantages set out in paragraphs 4 to 7 do not toi  our mind   offset   the   possible   effectof refusal on Russia and the Russian morale.     Further,the reasoning of telegram Mc No. 341 seems to usunconvincing and could not be justified publicly^     these views as to the Russian   position are naturally influenced by by the latest information as to the Russian militarysituation^2a In short, the&quot;Government is of the opinion and itis supported by the representatives of all Parties in theAdvisory War Council, that a refusal to accede to therequest of Russia to declare war on Finland, Roumania and hungary may v/ell be disastrous to Russian morale and be dangerous to our own,,3. Subject to any pronounced American reaction our view in that all considerations should be put up frankly1 to Stalin who is a realist and our decision governed byhis attitude6

From-    The Government of Canada.To.       Dominions Office.D. 31st October, 1941 1.54 p.m;R.   31st &quot; &quot;      11.0 p.ru.IMPORTANT.Ho.  255    MOST SECRET.Your telegram of October 27th m ho. 341.Following from Prime Minister.    Begins.    The canadian government feel that your telegram under referenceindicates very plainly the great difficulties involvedin meeting the Russian request for a declaration of war against Finland; Hungary and Roumania.    Over and abovedifficulty of the particular- considerations cited inyour telegram which in our view make a declaration ofwar  at this juncture  against any of these countriesinadvisable, we feel that a good deal of Weight shouldbe given to tne probability that a declaration of war against these countries because they are attacking russia would pre-judge tne decision,, which yet remains to betaken by the United Kingdom and other commonwealth governments,   is to whether or not they will declare war-on Japan if -Japan attacks Russia.   , Thi s will be  a veryserious decision wnich should be taken in relation to  3.11the probable consequences and not in accordance with a formal precedent created by similar action against smallerGerman satellite  states.A subsidiary consideration which is perhaps of greater loc xl impoitance in Canada than in other parts ofthe Commonwealth, is the probable effect of a formaldeclaration of war on the- loyalties and the state of mind of nationals of these countries resident in British countries.There are a great many Finns and a good number of Hungariansusefully employed in essential industries.    They are puzzledand confused by recent developments in Europe, but for themost part are pulling their weight well.    We would be reluctant to take any action likely to  shift  them fromsupport of the general war effort into an attitude ofmistrust and opposition.We recognize the difficulty in the presentcircumstances of refusing Russia such comfort    as she couldderive from a new gesture of ^ar-i tv on the part of her allies.      As the Matter stands however   it is not clear thatit would be any real aid or advantage  to Russia to have allthe nations of the British Commonwealth go tnrougn trie-motions of a formal declaration of war wnich could not affect the present military situation in any way, but would undoubtedly create   \ series of new and difficult problems for her vVllies.      Ends.

1S9From.The Government of Canada.To.Dominions Office.D. 31st October, 1R.   31st        &quot;1941,    3,0 p.m.11        11,15 p.m.IMPORTANT.No.226    MOST SECRET.With further reference  to your tolegr?am k. No.  341and our telegram No.  825.      I might add that in ouropinion a declaration of war at  this juncture by thecountries of the British Commonwealth against Finland,Hungary and Roumania might have a definite bearing uponthe entry of the United States into the war.    Over  and above allowance which has to be made for  the effect of suchaction on substantial body of American opinion whichpreserves a good deal of sympathy for.Finland we have  to remember that there are very considerable numbers of Finns,Hungarians and Roumanians in the United States.      If adeclaration of war  against Germany could be held to involvea similar declaration against Finland; Hungary and Roumaniasuch an argument might further postpone and obstruct the entry of the United States into the war.
