^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1941 , n__,___  -      i 01Copy No. 29W.P- W 256-November 4, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken tcensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.SITUATION IN RUSSIA. ,r.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I CIRCULATE herewith, for the information of my colleagues, freetranslations of the two messages from Colonel Pika, head of the CzechoslovakMilitary Mission in Russia, which I mentioned at Cabinet on the 3rd November.Colonel Pika knows Russia intimately and is regarded as one of the soundestobservers of present-day Russia.A. E.Foreign Office, November 4, 1941.First Message, October 25, 1941.1   LENINGRAD is holding out firmly and should continue to do so,although the local population is already suffering from a considerable lack ofI provisions.2. In the last few days a large number of reserves has come to Moscow fromI the East. The Germans have a strong superiority in tanks. This superiority will3 not be easily overcome.3. In Soviet circles there is still firm confidence in Moscow&apos;s ability to(defend itself successfully. Almost the whole Government has remained in1 Moscow. Molotoff will go frequently to Samara (Kuibisheft). Irom all 1 naveIseen and heard the Government is still resolute in its intention to carry on theI war even if Moscow falls. Voroshiloff and Budenny are organising the reservearmies in the rear. It is likely, too, that Voroshiloff will be given the task ofIpreparinP- the defence of the Volga. On the Southern front the situation in theI Don district and at Rostoff is very serious. There are no reserves on the spot, norlean they be transported there easily. On the other hand, Moscow has greaterI reserves than might have been expected.Ii     4.   In spite of this I must state quite objectively that the evacuation of moscow was a heavy blow to the population.   What caused depression was theI unexpected suddenness of the German break-through at Mojaisk.   Moreover, atI&apos; that moment it was difficult to supply Moscow with food, because the railwaysand roads were overburdened with the transport of troops from the East andthe evacuation of factories from the Moscow area.11539   [23-107]
There were also isolated signs of panic after the sudden evacuation of the diplomatic Corps. They did not last long, but must be noted. Characteristic wasthe case of the spontaneous and irresponsible closing of a Moscow boot factoryThis tendency was quickly checked. The managers and heads of departments were shot.   The effect of this example was good.I must mention an earlier case of summary executions. During a bombingraid fire broke out in a factory where fire-precautions had been neglected. Heretoo, the manager and sub-managers were promptly shot.To-day the situation is firmly in the hands of the executive power.5. The reserves, who have arrived in great numbers, made a ^oofiimpression. They sing as they go off to the front. Further reserves are beinocalled up. It is, however, not improbable that in the near future there will be acertain lack of foodstuffs in some districts. Large quantities of grain, potatoesvegetables, &amp;c, could not be cleared in time and were left in the fields. To-dayall the districts to the west of the Volga are under snow.6. It seems to me that here and there a Fifth Column is beginning to showsigns of life. I do not consider this danger to be great or alarming. A certaindefeatist activity in the Diplomatic Corps has become noticeable during the last few days. The chief culprit is the American chaplain Brown, who says that allis lost and that Russia is no longer able to defend herself. He claims to havelearned this from the Russians who come to see him. In American circles this tendency becomes more and more manifest.The Poles are also quickly depressed by any set-back and spread panic. at these moments the old Polish-Russian antagonisms show themselves again. the sufferings of the Polish generals and of all the Polish prisoners before the con-clusion of the Polish-Russian Treaty contribute largely to this tension. Here andthere, too, the Poles are becoming dissatisfied with the Soviet officials, who, havingtroubles enough of their own, do not help as before in the organisation of thePolish divisions. The Poles are therefore meeting with considerable difficultiesin equipping and feeding their men. In addition, the men in the camps are suffering from the cold.7. There is also some criticism of the Government by Soviet citizens. Thechief complaints are about the lack of organisation. Nevertheless, there are about 2 million well-organised Bolsheviks and executive officials whose lives areforfeit if Russia is defeated, and they have the internal situation firmly in hand.I consider that, after the first shock of the evacuation of Moscow, thesituation will become more normal and that, even if Moscow falls, the Avar will go on without the organised military strength of Russia being vitally affected.It seems to me that everyone here is fully conscious of the fact that there is noother way out and that there are sufficient forces to carry on the war and thepresent policy without any radical change.Second Message, October 29, 1941.I send the following additions to my last report:  In the Moscow sector the third phase of the German offensive is now in fullswing. The Germans have made only local advances, and there are signs thatthey are already experiencing a lack of petrol and oil, for on the south-westernpart of the Moscow front they are beginning to use only cavalry for this forwardaction.It seems that the decisive battle must take place in the immediate future,beginning about 20 kilom. from Moscow, and that this will settle the fate ofthe capital. I am confident that the defenders will, at the very worst,^hold their own for a considerable period. The very critical situation in the Southshows a relative improvement. The German superiority in tanks is still very marked, but the tanks are not concentrated in one sector, and the Russians standup to the attacks for long periods. The strongest tank column is in the directionof Rostoff.
