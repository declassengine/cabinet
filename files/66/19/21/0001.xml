I Copy NoW.P- W 2m-October 26, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.war CABINET.DECLARATION OF WAR ON FINLAND, HUNGARY and roumania.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN accordance with War Cabinet Conclusions 105 (41), Conclusion 6, andafter consultation with the Secretary of State for the Dominions, I circulate tomy colleagues herewith a draft telegram to Lord Halifax and the DominionGovernments setting forth our views on the advisability of declaring war onFinland, Hungary and Roumania, and asking for their observations.(Foreign Office, October 26, 1941.Draft Telegram.[To Dominions only: October 1941.Circular M. No.Following from Prime Minister.  Begins: No.We have recently been considering our relations with Finland, Hungary and roumania.]In a message to Stalin delivered by Sir S. Cripps on the 6th September thePrime Minister said &quot;we are willing to put any pressure upon Finland in our power, including immediate intimation that we will declare war upon them ifthey continue beyond the old frontiers.&quot; In reporting on his interview with Stalinafter the delivery of this message Sir S. Cripps said that Stalin would, of course,like us to declare war on Finland at once.2.   On    the    17th    October    the    Soviet    Ambassador    delivered    totL  a---------1----ji-rT--*---------a iv -     a message from M. Molotov to thewie Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs 0effect that the Soviet Government would appreciate it if we could see our way to declare war on Finland, Roumania and Hungary. He repeated this message withgreat emphasis on the 21st October and pressed very urgently for a favourablereply.11530   [23058]
3. It is clear that the Soviet Government attach very-great importance toour acceding to this request and &apos; we naturally are anxious not to rebuff ordiscourage them when at this critical juncture they ask us to make a&apos;gesture ofthis kind. A refusal might arouse their latent suspicions as to our motives.There are, however, certain practical considerations which must be taken intoaccount.  These can be summarised as follows : ; 4. As regards all three countries a British declaration of war would make it easier for Germany, if she so desires at a later stage to force those countries toallow their troops to be used in operations against British forces. Moreover, aswe have taken all practical measures that are taken on declaration of war exceptfor the internment of Finns, Hungarians and Roumanians in this country, adeclaration of war would have no practical effect of a beneficial nature.Finland.5. (a) A declaration of war might well drive the Finns, including those whodislike the Germans and do not want open conflict with us, further into theGerman arms.   The threat contained in our recent message (see my telegramNo. 5220) ^. ,    ,D. No. 582 of 25th September) to treat Finlaild as a* GPen enemy, not onlywhile the war lasts but also when peace comes to be made &quot; is only effective whileit remains a threat.(b) Certain difficulties would arise in regard to shipping, viz. :- (i) We should forfeit our dhances of getting twenty-seven ships now in north and South American waters for the North Atlantic, which weare attempting to have taken over by the Swedes who would charterthem to us. If we declare war, we could only expect that after longdelays these ships might be employed in trade useful to the Americans;(ii) we might cause some dislocation to United States trade, for we havebeen shepherding these ships into this trade by arrangement with theUnited States Maritime Commission;(iii) we should lose some Finnish crews.(c) We anticipate that a declaration of war would be distasteful to that body of American opinion which is favourable to the Finns. Moreover, weshould be diverging from the American policy of attempting to exploit the difference of opinion which the United States Government believe exists in Finland in regard to continuing aggressive action on Soviet territory (seeyour telegram No. 5838).my telegram of&quot;9th&quot;October, D No. 609).Hungary.6. A declaration of war on Hungary would please the Yugoslav Govern-ment, since Hungary has invaded Yugoslav territory, and it might cause pleasurein Czechoslovak quarters. On the other hand, it might be less welcome to Poland,who attaches importance to her relations with Hungary after the war.Roumania.7. Roumania and Hungary must be considered together, so that nofavouritism is shown to one or the other&apos;s claim to Transylvania. Yugoslavsattach importance to reconstruction of a strong Roumania and would probablyprefer us not to go to war with her. Nor would declaration of war be welcome to Greece or Turkey.Furthermore, if war were declared on Roumania and Hungary, the greek and Yugoslav Governments would press for similar action in regard to Bulgaria,who has seized portions of their territory and is massacring Greek subjects.Unless pressed by the Soviet Government to declare war on Bulgaria (and theyhave not made this request), His Majesty&apos;s Government would not wish to do so,principally because it would probably cause the Turkish Government somedispleasure. Such a request by the Greek and Yugoslav Governments would,therefore, be refused. The question of Bulgaria need not, therefore, influence the decision regarding a declaration of war on Roumania and Hungary.
(To United Slates only.) , luorainowD K-iro-? ,sd j      5 -ipolo -8., Before taking: any, decision, -it is /important that we should know whatthe attitudeoi the United States Government is likelyto be.  I should be gratefultherefore, if you would take an early opportunity of inviting the views of theState Department.  I am also requesting the views&apos;of the Dominion Governments.(To Dominions only.)8. Identical action by all British Commonwealth Governments is clearlynecessary and we should therefore be glad for views of your Government atearliest possible moment. We are also obtaining views of United StatesGovernment.
