The U-boat was brought to the surface by depth charge attack and thenengaged by gunfire until she surrendered. During the engagement the gunlayerof the Lady Shirley was killed and four of the crew were wounded. ELM. OceanBoarding Vessel Maron engaged a U-boat at long range in the same area onthe following day.Other surface craft made inconclusive attacks S.E. of Iceland (C) and 600miles west of Ireland.In the Mediterranean ELM. Corvette Peony claims to have damaged a U-boat off Beirut.Four attacks were made by aircraft, one about 150 miles west of the BloodyForeland and the others about 200 west of Ushant, One of the latter attackswas promising.Enemy Intelligence.8. The Admiral Scheer is now in the floating dock at Hamburg and isbelieved to be either damaged or suffering from mechanical defects.There are indications of one raider operating in the Indian Ocean andanother in the Southern Pacific.U-Boats.9. The number of U-Boats operating during the week has been below therecent average. The main concentration appears to have been in the latitude ofNorthern Spain, north-west of the Azores. Some German U-Boats are believed to have passed into the Mediterranean.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.10. During the week two ships have been sunk and one damaged by aircraft in the Gulf of Suez and one has been sunk by mine in the Suez Canal.A large tanker was torpedoed south of Iceland (C) but is still afloat. aircraft attacked shipping off Yarmouth and in the Bristol Channel without result butdamaged a small vessel near the Faroes. The s.s. Sturdee Rose shot down anattacking aircraft off Milford Haven.Reports have been received of the sinking by U-Boat of two ships off the brazilian coast at the end of last month, one of them being the American tanker/. C. White. Details are also to hand of the casualties caused by fog to an outward convoy in the Belle Isle Straits at the end of September; eight ships(of about 5,000 tons average) were affected either by collision or grounding; fourwere able to return to harbour, three are ashore and one sank.Protection of Seaborne Trade. ,11. During the week ending the 8th October, 821 ships, including 155 allied and 25 neutral, were convoyed. One cruiser, 4 anti-aircraft ships, 6 armed merchant cruisers, 93 destroyers (including 20 United States destroyers) and95 sloops, corvettes and fleet minesweepers were employed on escort duty.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the4th October totalled 784,584 tons and there were, in addition, about 8,000 tons ofspecial Government cargo.   The average for the last ten weeks was 962,114 tons.Oil imports were 232,244 tons. Mineral imports amounted to 220,646 tons,of which 136,625 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Wood andwood-pulp imports were 43,388 tons, copra and palm oil 2,444 tons and cereals118,836 tons. Other food imports totalled 130,122 tons, of which the principalcommodities, in tons, were : Sugar, 64,738, refrigerated and tinned meat, bacon and ham 22,529, fruit 4,909, cheese 4,717, lard and other edible fats 4,576,tea 3,732, fish 3,330, and eggs 2,141.[22997] CC b
British Minelaying.12. H.M. Ships Welshman and Manxman laid 313 mines in the East coast barrier and Port Quebec laid 640 mines in the Butt of Lewis area. Owing toadverse weather there has been little minelaying by aircraft, but some mines havebeen laid off the French Biscay ports.Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping.Home Waters.13. Enemy aircraft have laid mines on most nights during the period in the humber area, other parts of the East Coast between the Firth of Forth andYarmouth have been visited, and the Bristol Channel.Sweeping operations in the vicinity of Portsmouth had to be temporarilypostponed in order to make the necessary sweeping arrangements for the projected exchange of prisoners.Five magnetic and 39 acoustic mines have been destroyed during the week,and the totals now are : Magnetic 1,444, Acoustic 1,086, Contact 1063.Foreign Waters.14. A ship was sunk by a mine in the Suez Canal on the 5th October and ahopper detonated another. These mines are believed to have been dropped onthe 12th July and the 7th May respectively. The Canal was closed for 48 hours and thoroughly swept and is now reopened.Two mines (which were thought to have been laid on the 19th September)were detonated in Suez Bay.Mines were laid at Tobruk on the 30th September, but they have all beenaccounted for.Enemy Merchant Shipping.15. The Italian Duilio (23,636 tons), which was believed to have been torpedoed and possibly sunk by ELM. Submarine Urge off Capri at the end ofAugust, was reported to be in Venice with a hole in her side on the20th September.The German tanker Germania, 9,851 tons, which is at Teneriffe, was reported on the 6th October to have completed all her preparations for departure.British Contraband Control.16. During the month of September 10,720 tons of cargo destined for theenemy were seized in prize. The main items were 5,946 tons of base metals,taken from Spanish ships, and 3,255 tons of food-stuffs and beverages and1,440 tons of chemicals and allied products, entirely from French ships. other commodities included 5,945 tons of pyrites and 2,533 tons of coffee. The totalseizures since the beginning of the war amount to 810,239 tons.Russian Intelligence.17. The British Liaison Officer with the Russian Black Sea fleet has reportedthat no damage has been done to harbours or towns in the Crimea up to thepresent, and no further damage to the fleet except to one destroyer.The Russian fleet has been engaged in giving support to troops on the coast of the Sea of Azov and has been employed in convoy duty.vichy French Intelligence.18. Vichy French traffic with war materials and personnel to north and west African ports continues and has recently increased. In the last half ofSeptember 13 ships have sailed for Casablanoa or Dakar via Oran and 4 havetaken troops and war material to Oran to be forwarded by rail to the west african ports. It is to be presumed that such a considerable volume of trafficcannot be sustained without the approval of the enemy.
A Vichy French broadcast of 6th October stated that the Theophile Gautier(8,195 tons) had been torpedoed and sunk in the ^aegean while on her way to greece with corn for the Greek populace. She was stated to have been illuminatedand showing the French colours, and it was implied that a British submarine hadtorpedoed a ship engaged on relief work. No information of the intended move-ments of this ship had been received by the British authorities and she was lastheard of at Salonika in August.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is includedin the Resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Finland.19. There is no change on the Murmansk or Kandalaksha fronts. Finnishforces have reached the western shores of Lake Onega, and the capture of Petro-zavodsk is confirmed.Leningrad Sector.20.   No material change has taken place.Central Sector.21. A considerable German advance north-east of Veliki Luki is reported,but no details are known of its extent.Fighting is in progress north-east of Smolensk, but the most important opera-tions on the whole of the Eastern front are developing south of the Smolensk-Moscow railway. These operations, involving a large proportion of the german armoured troops and considerable air forces, seem to consist of two thrusts : theone along the axis of the Roslavl-Moscow road and the other in the directionBryansk-Orel. The extent of these advances is not known, but they are believed to have made considerable progress, and the more northerly advance is already a potential threat to the Russian forces in the area Yartsevo-Vyasma, which theGermans will probably aim at enveloping and destroying, before furtherdeveloping their thrust towards Moscow.The more southerly advance is probably aimed at eventually cutting the mainrailways running south from Moscow. This advance has made rapid progress.The Russians are believed to have transferred most of the first-class divisions outof this area at the time of the German- southward thrust from Glukhov, in antici-pation of a thrust south-eastwards towards Kharkov and the Donetz Basin.Ukraine and Crimea.22. The Germans are still meeting with stiff resistance in their advance towards Kharkov, and very little progress has been made.Further south, German armoured forces have advanced eastwards andsouthwards from Dniepropetrovsk towards the Sea of Azov. Simultaneously,German forces have been attacking eastwards in the Melitopol area, and theRussian forces in this area are now threatened with envelopment.Fighting continues at the approaches to the Crimea, but no progress hasbeen made by the Germans.Odessa remains in Russian hands.C conclusion.23. German immediate intentions seem to be to continue the investment ofLeningrad, to envelop and destroy Russian forces east of Yartsevo prior to a continuation of the thrust in the direction of Moscoav, to drive eastwards fromBryansk in order to cut communications between Moscow and the south, and toannihilate the Russian forces in the Zaporozhe-Berdyansk-Melitopol area.[22997] b 2
Although the campaign has now been in progress for fifteen weeks, and heavy fighting has continued all this time on most parts of the front, the Germanleaders do not appear to have relaxed in any way their intention to destroy the Russian armed forces before winter sets in. So long as Russian morale holdsgood this task will continue to be a heavy one, and rapid progress by german armoured forces will be halted periodically by the necessity to surround andmop up large numbers of Russian troops. The morale of the Russian troopsremains good, but the fall of Kiev made a profound impression and, as the threat to Leningrad and Moscow increases, morale is bound to be affected.Operations,Egypt and Libya.24. At Tobruk, with the exception of sporadic enemy air activity upon thetown and harbour and also intermittent artillery shelling, neither of which caused much damage, there is nothing to report. One of our patrols in the southhas destroyed a small enemy ammunition dump, and another shot up an enemyworking party, inflicting some casualties.Enemy reinforcements of M/T and material to Libya continue, but no increase has been reported in the number of German troops, which remains at two armoured divisions, together with elements of an infantry division.Syria.25. There has been a certain amount of tribal trouble in the Deir-ez-Zorarea. A small incident took place on the 22nd September, when Free french troops were fired on as they were attempting to collect taxes at Agadat village,15 miles north of Abu Kemal. There were some casualties amongst the French.Later our Political Officer arrived in the area and reported that the Frenchwounded had been handed back, and that the French had occupied certain villagesand imposed a fine of 1,000 rifles. After a meeting between the French and headsof the tribes, this fine was reduced to 100 rifles.26. On the 29th September a British patrol was fired upon in the Meyadinarea by approximateley 500 Arabs, but withdrew without casualties. The next day a larger patrol cleared the area. There were further conferences betweenFrench and British Political Officers and the tribal leaders. At present thesituation is quiet, on the surface.Persia.27. The situation has not altered materially and, apart from a visit by oneof our patrols to Isfahan, the disposition of our troops remains the same.28. There has been fighting between the Kurds and Persian troops inthe area of Saqiz. The situation is obscure, but it would appear that the Kurdshave routed the small Persian force, referred to in last week&apos;s Resume, and forced it to retire eastward.29. 477 male Germans and 79 Italians are now interned at Basra, awaitingshipping.Intelligence.France.30. The number of German divisions in S.-W. France remains at fivewith an armoured division in the process of formation. Troop movementshave, however, been reported from this area to the north.Balkan States.31. The likelihood of a combined operation by the enemy from Roumanianand Bulgarian ports is still indicated by reports of landing exercises by Germanand Italian troops and of activity at these ports, particularly those in Bulgaria,two of which have been reported as closed to all,civilian traffic. -
32. The number of German troops in Bulgaria remains at three divisions.An increase of two divisions in Yugoslavia, doubtless on account of the disturbances in that country, has raised the total number of German divisions inthe Balkans (including Hungary and Slovakia) from twelve to fourteen.Indo-China.33. The Japanese are extending and consolidating their occupation ofSouthern Indo-China by landing additional troops, by the requisitioning of accommodation for military personnel and stores, and by extending and improving the aerodromes under their command.34. At present there are 28,000 Japanese troops in Indo-China. Theyoccupy seven aerodromes and are reported to be pressing&apos; for the cession of afurther three.Far East.35. The Japanese have cut Chinese rail communications in Honan and established a bridge-head over the Yellow River from which operations could bestaged at a later date, either westwards towards Tungkwan and Sian orsouthwards to join up with the Japanese forces in Central China. There are,however, no signs at present that either of these operations are contemplated inthe immediate future.AIR SITUATION.General Review.36. Our offensive operations against enemy objectives were considerablyrestricted by unfavourable weather, especially at night, when fog developed overwide areas of this country.German Air Force activity on the Western Front remained at a low level.Successful attacks against enemy shipping in the Mediterranean have con-tinued and the scale of air operations in Libya has increased.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.37. Bomber Command despatched 12 Sorties, compared with 28 last week,and dropped 3 tons of bombs and 24 incendiaries. Fighter Command flew 410sorties in the course of offensive operations over occupied territory and against shipping.   Attacks on shipping are reported under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;The Ostend Electricity Power Station was attacked by six Blenheimsescorted by fighters, but the bombs overshot the target and fell on nearby ware-houses.38. A Beaufort of Coastal Command made a determined attack from avery low height on two factory buildings at Mjovik, in Norway, and severely damaged them.39. Offensive operations by Fighter Command were impossible on three days of the week and severely restricted on two others owing to continuous bad weather.On the remaining two days a total of 28 Squadron sorties were flown. during these operations our fighters destroyed seven enemy aircraft; probably destroyedthree; and damaged six. Nine of our fighters are missing, but one pilot wasrescued.40. In general, enemy fighter activity was on a small scale, although duringour offensive sweeps opposition in moderate strength was encountered in the pas de Calais area.Night.41. As a result of extremely unfavourable weather conditions, only109 sorties were despatched by Bomber Command compared with 688 last week.A total of 163 tons of HE. bombs and 14,600 incendiaries were released. Alloperations were cancelled on five nights of the week, and on another only sixaircraft were despatched. The objectives on the remaining night were the docks at Rotterdam, Antwerp, Dunkirk and Brest.
42. The docks at Dunkirk were attacked by 40 aircraft, which dropped59 tons of H.E. bombs and 5,200 incendiaries. Bursts were seen across the docks and several fires were started. Fifty-two tons of H.E. bombs and 3,660 incen-diaries were released on the docks at Rotterdam. The Petroleum Harbour was hit several times, substantial fires were caused and there were numerousexplosions. At Antwerp, which was attacked on a lighter scale, many fires were observed, including an exceptionally large one on the north side of No. 2 CanalDock.43. The battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at Brest were attacked on two nights of the week by Halifax and Stirling aircraft. A total of 25 tonsof H.E. bombs, including twenty 2,000-lb. bombs, was dropped. On the first occasion three Halifaxes saw their bombs burst in the target area, but laterarrivals were hampered by an effective smoke-screen. There was much cloud whenthe Stirlings attacked, but bursts were seen in the docks.44. Blenheims and Beauforts of Coastal Command scored hits on a railway centre and on warehouses at St. Nazaire, and on gun positions at Lorient andBrest. Nine Hudsons attacked three aerodromes near Aalborg in Denmark.Runways and aerodrome buildings were hit.45. Five Havocs of Fighter Command dropped bombs on the aerodromes atGilze-Rijen, Merville and Clastres.46. At night, enemy defensive patrols over the Netherlands and north-west germany were few. Small-scale patrols were also maintained over Brest andCherbourg on four nights of the week.United Kingdom.47. Fighter Command flew a total of 1,331 sorties by day (including dawn),and 258 sorties by night (including dusk).48. German Air Force activity has been on the same low scale as that oflast week. Only five aircraft crossed the coast by day. Only on the night ofthe 2nd/3rd was the effort concentrated against land targets, when Tyneside was attacked by about 40 long-range bombers, and Dover by 15 dive-bombers. Threeenenry bombers were destroyed by our night fighters. Enemy fighters operatedover East Anglia on two nights of the week.Coastal Operations.49. Coastal Command flew 164 patrols (242 sorties) and provided 33 convoy escorts (98 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols carried out by fighter command totalled 308 (623 sorties).50. A Beaufort of Coastal Command on patrol attacked from mast heighttwo merchant vessels of 1,000 and 2,000 tons respectively off Bergen. Each ship was hit by a 500-lb. bomb. Another merchant vessel of 2,000 tons was machine-gunned. A second Beaufort registered two near misses on a merchant vessel offSkotning on the Norwegian Coast.51. Eight Hurricanes of Fighter Command attacked a convoy off Gravelinesconsisting of a merchant vessel of about 700 tons and seven flak ships. Themerchant vessel and three flak ships were set on fire and three flak ships were damaged. Other Hurricanes sank an armoured barge off Knocke, and also sank one and damaged two armed trawlers off Qstend.52. Enemy offensive operations by day were confined to routine weather and shipping reconnaissance in the Shetlands area, and off our coasts. Qn most days,aircraft of the Condor unit operated in the Atlantic. By night, activity consistedlargely of shipping reconnaissances, particularly in the Humber and the bristol channel. Five shipping attacks were made during the week, one by day off the shetlands, and four by night, one off Yarmouth and three off Lundy Island.Enemy mining was probably carried out in the Bristol Channel, off milford haven, and off the Yorkshire Coast.
Central Mediterranean.53. Eight Blenheims from Malta made a successful daylight raid on thepower station, engine sheds and a munitions works at Cantanzaro Marina,S. Italy, and hits were made on all the targets. The success of a night attack by two Blenheims on railway sheds at Catania was confirmed by photographs which showed five hits. Hurricanes carried out three attacks with bombs and cannonfire against the aerodrome at Comiso, Sicily, and against railway stations in thevicinity.54. Many offensive sorties were despatched against enemy shipping locatedby our reconnaissance aircraft. Swordfish made two successful night torpedoattacks on ships in convoy. They sank a merchant ship of 6,000 tons off cape Bon; and severely damaged two others, totalling 15,000 tons, and probably a third, 50 miles N.E. of Tripoli (L). A Blenheim made a successful moonlightattack on a merchant ship of 2,000 tons off Tripoli (L), and left her with herstern under water after making two hits. A Wellington on patrol off WesternSicily made one hit on a large merchant ship.55. Eight Blenheims, unable to looate their shipping target, attacked theport of Zuara, W. of Tripoli (L), straddling a destroyer, and obtaining near misses on a blockhouse. One Blenheim was lost and one Italian fighter was probably destroyed during this operation. The Misurata-Sirte road was attacked by five Blenheims which destroyed a petrol tanker and 14 lorries.56. Three night attacks were made by a total of 24 Wellingtons on shipping at Tripoli (L). In the course of these attacks one merchant ship was set on fire and another of 10,000 tons was hit, while burning oil from a tanker spread Overa wide area. Hits and near misses were also observed on two other merchant ships, and a number of lighters were destroyed or damaged. reconnaissance aircraft carried out wide searches for shipping, and a Maryland so engagedattacked a submarine off Syracuse with machine-gun fire.A few enemy fighters crossed the coast of Malta by day, and bombs were dropped on the island on two nights. A few civilian casualties were caused, butmaterial damage was negligible.Eastern Mediterranean.57. Our bombers from Egypt have maintained a heavy offensive against shipping at Benghazi and against military stores and dumps along the Libyancoast. A total of 64 Wellingtons made night attacks on Benghazi, where firesand explosions broke out after hits had been made on a ship and on the moles.Bardia, Barce, and the aerodrome at Benina were also attacked. At Benina theofficers&apos; quarters were hit and at Barce fires were seen near the power station and repair shops. Two Wellingtons were lost during these operations. Blenheimsand Albacores also flew many successful night sorties against petrol stores, dumpsand workshops at Benghazi, and in the Bardia area. Considerable damage was done to aircraft on the landing ground at G-azala. These raids were followed up during daylight by mary lands of the South African Air Force.58. Our fighters flew many shipping protection patrols and escorted ourreconnaissance aircraft in the frontier areas. In the course of engagements with enemy fighters during the week we lost six fighters and probably destroyed twoof the enemy and damaged four others. The appearance in North Africa of afew Me. 109Fs. has now been confirmed, and it is considered probable that theGerman fighter units in this area are in process of being re-equipped with aircraft of this type.59. There was an increase in German offensive operations this week,particularly against Tobruk, which was attacked frequently throughout the week.Mines, some very heavy bombs, and many anti-personnel bombs were droppedover a wide area, and one attack lasted almost continuously for about eight hours. Except for the sinking of a trawler none of these raids caused any appreciable damage, and the number of casualties has been extremely small.Bombing attacks were also made on Mersa Matruh and on a number of landing-grounds; enemy fighters machine gunned our troops in the Buq Buq areabut without inflicting any casualties. During the week a total of about seven aircraft attacked the Canal Zone.
60. On the night of the 6th/7th a force of 23 Wellingtons attacked oil installations, warehouses and shipping at the Piraeus. Very large oil-fed fires were started among the fuel cisterns, and other fires broke out among quaysidebuildings and in an adjacent chemical works.  &apos;61. Bombs were dropped on Cyprus by day by a single enemy aircraft, andon three nights by about five aircraft on each occasion. Apart from slight damage to a runway at Limassol aerodrome, there were no damage or casualties.An ineffective attack was made on Haifa by nine aircraft on the night of the7th/8th, and two aircraft approached Tripoli (S) on the 6th, but did not attack.Gibraltar.62. Many reconnaissance sorties were flown during the week, coveringaerodromes and ports in S.E. Spain, Algeria and Morocco. Thirteen anti-submarine patrols and convoy escorts were also flown.West Africa.63. Sunderlands, Hudsons and Hurricanes flew daily convoy escorts and anti-submarine patrols.Russia.British Air Operations.64. Weather conditions prevented operations by our fighter wing on several days. Seven patrols were flown during the week, some of which were escortingRussian bombers. Our aerodrome at Vayanga was attacked by 14 bombers and fighters on the 6th, and the Hurricanes destroyed three Ju. 88s, probably destroyed two Ju. 88s and one Me. 109, and damaged six Ju. 88s. We sustainedone slight casualty.Russian Air Operations.65.   There is no information of Russian air operations.German Air Operations.66. A strong concentration of the German Air Force under Field-MarshalKesselring, A.O.C., of Luftflotte 2, is supporting the offensive now developingagainst Moscow from the Smolensk area. Air operations so far appear to havebeen mainly directed against Russian communication centres and aerodromes.67. It is considered that the ten days&apos; lull in the Central Sector following the encirclement of Kiev was utilised for the overhaul of aircraft, resting ofcrews and redisposition of units, which may have been reinforced from the leningrad Sector, where air activity has recently been on a low scale.68.- Progress against Kharkov continues to be slow and.strong Russian airopposition has been encountered. In the Perekop Isthmus no further advance towards the Crimea appears to have taken place, and G.A.F. operations in this area have been temporarily transferred further east to support a rapid advancesouth-eastwards from the Dnieper bend towards the Sea of Azov.69. Elsewhere there has been little activity of importance, and bad weather in northern Norway has considerably interfered with flying operations in the murmansk front.70. The use of parachute troops against the Crimea has not been confirmed,but the Russians claim to have encountered troops from a parachute regimentfighting as infantry in the Leningrad area.Italian Air Operations.71. The Italians have sent some 50 fighters and 20 Army Co-operation air-craft to the Russian front. The fighters are known to have been operatingrecently in.the Ukraine sector.
Far East.Chinese Air Operations.72. Reports have been received of a renewal of activity, after many months,by the small Chinese bomber force. These raids include one by moonlight onIchang on 2nd October and four day raids during the last Aveek of September onHankow.For effective operational purposes the Chinese Air Force has, however,practically ceased to exist.  At present it consists of Two squadrons Russian 1.16 fighters ...       ...      20 aircraftThree squadrons modified Russian S.B. bombers      30 aircraftHOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.By Day.73. The only daylight bombing reported during the week was on Sunday,the 5th October, at Skaw, in the Shetland Islands, where 4 H.E. bombs causedone slight casualty and damage to a water main.By Night.74. Bombing was still on a small scale, although there was considerably more activity on the 2nd/3rd October.On that night the Tyneside and Tees-side areas were attacked. SouthShields suffered most. Fifty people were killed and about 250 buildings were destroyed. On the same night Dover was attacked three times. Flouse propertysuffered extensively and there were ten fatal casualties. Bombs were also droppedwithout serious effect at many points in north-east and eastern counties, Kentand Cornwall.On the 7th/8th eight people were killed at Rogerstone, near Newport(Mon.), and some damage was done at Bournemouth, Shepton Mallet and NewRadnor.On the other nights of the week the results of bombing were negligible.Damage.2nd/3rd October.South Shields.75. The Ship-building and ship repairing industries suffered severely. the electrical gear of the new sub-station of Brigham and Cowan, Ltd., Shipbuilders,was wrecked and workshops and stores of the Tyne Dock Engineering company were damaged.Seventeen gas mains were broken but supply as a whole was maintained.North Shields.76. The Newcastle and Gateshead Gas Company&apos;s works were damaged and it is estimated that normal production will not be resumed for two months,although limited supplies may be maintained.Railways.77. L.N.E.R. services between Tyne Docks and South Shields and between north Shields and Tynemouth had to be suspended temporarily owing to the linesbeing blocked.Casualties.78. Casualties for the week ending 0800 on the 8th October are estimatedat 77 killed and 137 seriously injured, of whom 50 were killed and 101 injured atSouth Shields on the 2nd/3rd.[22997]c
