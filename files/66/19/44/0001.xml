E. BRIDGES,Secretary of the War Cabinet.Great George Street, S.W. 1,November 14, 1941.(1)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated November 1, 1941(Important.)2748-S. Personal. Aney Sarker and Rao in their-interviews this morningurged on me desirability of letting out Nehru and Kalameazad. Azad&apos;s term isdue to expire in January; Nehru&apos;s has still a considerable time to run. Raoagrees that Nehru&apos;s offence was very bad and that he only got what he deserved,but took point that, if he were released now (even though we should be most unlikely to get any undertaking or guarantee from him, and probably unwise toask for one), and he offended again, he would go back to jail; that in favour of release was fact that his detention, however justified, was producing a bad effect in Left Centre in Parliament, and doing us harm in U.S.A.Both took much the saine line about Azad : that, so long as he was in prison, Gandhi had an excuse for not doing anything on the ground that his principal Lieutenant and president of Working Committee were in prison.2. I said to all of them that this was not such a simple business as it lookedand that it was one that I should have to consider carefully. Neither asked thatit should be discussed in Council at this stage, but we may, of course, come tothat point.3. I should be grateful for any comment. I cannot, of course, say whatgeneral reaction, if matters came up in Council, would be likely to be there might clearly be much difference of opinion. I realise also the attention that hasto be paid to possible Moslem reactions in this matter and fact that presentsuggestion is really only an aspect, though a most important aspect of generalissue of release of so-called political prisoners. I would propose to feel my way[23151] B
rather carefully; and any examination of general issue (aspects of which haverecently been under reference to local Governments) would clearly necessitateconsultation with provinces before any recommendation could be made to you ^)for consideration.  But, as I say, any comment which you may oare to let me havewould be very welcome.(2)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State for India, dated november 7, 1941.(Immediate.)2802-S. Personal. My personal telegram of 1st November. Release ofprisoners. Matter has now (? become) one of urgency in view of the resolution by Joshi for debate on 12th November recommending the release, in agreementwith Provincial Governments, of prisoners or other persons detained for expression of political opinions, &amp;c. Question was discussed at length at (? meetings) of council on the 5th and 6th November. We shall be telegraphing officially (andI may telegraph further through personal channels), but think you ought at once to have this (% preliminary) indication of position.2. Maxwell analysed at considerable length and with great clarity various categories of prisoners, detenus, &amp;C. (? which) might be regarded as falling withinthe terms of Joshi&apos;s motion. He indicated also the general result of recentsoundings which we have been taking of Provincial Governments as to theirattitude towards reduction of remission of sentences, .&amp;c. Point was finally made that, while Jalam Azad was an ordinary Satyagrahi imprisoned for breaking thelaw by repeating slogans, Nehru&apos;s case was (? different) in principle since hehad been sentenced by the Courts for a bad speech made in circumstances ofparticular danger.3. From result of antagonistic discussion it emerged : (a) that no memberof my Council was anxious to do anything except for : (1) genuine satyagrahis,(2) Azad and Nehru. They were quite content that the Communists, revolu-tionaries and non-symbolic satyagrahis, persons imprisoned for active oppositionto recruitment, &amp;c, should remain in jail;. (6) as regards satyagrahis Indianmembers were unanimous in the view that as for most part they had only about two months still to run we should now as a gesture remit the balance of sentences of those now in prison on the understanding, of course, that if thereafter theyagain offended they would be (? sentenced) and imprisoned as in the past,particular emphasis being laid on the political value from the point of view ofexpanded Council of a move of this character. Raisman and Clow, though with more hesitation, accepted the view of the Indian members.(c) As regards Nehru and Azad the Indian members, without exception,expressed the view (which, of course, you and I have ourselves felt) that the sentence (? originally) imposed on Nehru of 4 years was quite excessive, andshould be reduced to what would have been a reasonable figure-say 12 to 18months or remitted altogether. Further discussion showed that general feeling was decisively in favour of complete-remission and of immediate enlargementoTl^ehru^rmultaneously.. wij^buSAtyagrahis (who would, bf course, include Azad)partly oh&quot;&apos;the ground that, if anything was to be done in his case, we had bettergo the whole way now and produce some impression of conciliation. Risk thatNehru may be irreconcilable and that he might then find himself in trouble(and thereafter possibly in jail) in the near future again was fully admitted.4. I said that I would, of course, report what had taken place and thefeeling of my colleagues; that the matter was one in which I must takeProvincial Governments with me as they were the persons responsible (save inthe case of some 15 Communists arrested under orders from Central Governmentand of centrally administered areas); that as regards satyagrahis I held no very strong view and was prepared to commend view taken by my colleagues to governments concerned : as regards Nehru I drew a sharp distinction between his case and Azad&apos;s and said that I anticipated that Government of the united provinces would be likely to see very strong objection to remission, whatever theymight think about reduction.
*) n o&amp;    d5. My own conclusions at this stage, subject to views of Provincial-Government, is that we should let satyagrahis go. I do not myself believe, and made this clear to Council, that we shall get much thanks or political result from doing so. But I appreciate new Council&apos;s desire to appear to be exercisinginfluence of a liberal character, and I dare say that release may strengthen their hands.I think there is force in argument that very few of satyagrahis are likely to court arrest again and that movement is in any case in such a position that wecan afford to treat it contemptuously at this stage.6. As regards Azad, I would treat him as a satyagrahi, to which categoryhe properly belongs, and release him with them. As regards Nehru, I am not quite so easv^jand I anticipate that Hallett may be rather stickyi r^hould^&quot;havemyself^eenauvantage in ieductiohT^h^F&quot;than remission. But there is forcein the point that, if we are to do anything for him, we had better go the wholeway, and I cannot but be impressed by the fact that Mody and all my Moslemmembers, including Noon (who put on record arguments on the other side) andHydari, were in favour of remission in his case.7. Maxwell brought out forcibly in his statement that as a Council and government we had no standing in this matter save where arrests were under our own orders or in areas controlled by us, and that decision must be that of provincial Government concerned. He also emphasised extreme importance of avoiding any suggestion of overriding ministerial governments where they existedand possibility that Government of the Punjab might resign if course was taken of which it did not approve.  He reported that general result of recent referenceto Provincial Government had been, that they......saw,no particular, advantage inadvahTiin^&quot;datig&quot;of&quot;fei^ierih&apos; the case of S^^jg^jbis^ either politically or other-wrseT^andTh^rTBeywere ou^oMd&quot;toTerthese sentences, which in most cases had only a couple of months unexpired, to run their course.8.   I would be grateful for your preliminary views as soon as convenient.(3)Telegram from Secretary of State for India to Governor-General, dated november 8, 1941.(Immediate.)14275.1. Personal. Your personal telegrams 2748-S and 2802-S. political prisoners. I note you are consulting Governors, but trust Provincial Governorswill not make difficulty if f ighT course &quot;topursuer&quot;-&quot;&quot;1&quot;      &quot;   &quot;&quot;&quot;^2. On the general issue my feeling is that we should not be undulyinfluenced by opinion here or in America, though release would undoubtedly have a favourable effect. What matters most is effect in India. There it seemsto me that no harm would be done and probably good, providing it is quite clearthat our action is basedjdu^ clemency alone in view of the admitted failure of gandhi &apos;s campaign and contains in ft &quot;no &quot;suggestion of bargaining or approach to Congress. For this would imply doubt as to our confidence in seeing throughCongress opposition whatever form it may take, and would incidentally have abad effect on Moslem opinion. We have undoubtedly won, and most congress leaders not only know it but admit it. Even Gandhi says he would be content with two in prison and the rest spinning.\ 3.   I am also influenced as you are by the desire to strengthen the hands ofyour Council, and all the more so since, as I &quot;gather, there was no differencebetween your Moslem and Hindu colleagues on the issue of releasing the symbolicsatyagrahis, while they were at the same time agreed in being opposed as Ishould be very strongly to the release of revolutionaries and active mischief-makers in fact, those who are convicted or detained otherwise than for symbolicbreaches of law.4. Kalim Azad clearly falls within the symbolic satyagrahist category.Nehru, is in a different class; and in any statement that may be required in regardto him I should be inclined to emphasise that fact even while announcingremission or reduction at the same tlinet^Tryotriio not wish to release him
simultaneously with rank and file, would not a simple solution be to decide thathis three sentences of sixteen months are to be regarded.aaxunnipg,concurrently ?We Eotn&quot;rwoutc!-^ time, but were rightly opposed to)overruling the magistrate then.&apos; This, coupled with normal remission for good conduct, would, I suppose, let him out early in the year, but perhaps you couldlet me know more precisely. . .    . .5. As regards the actual method of release of satyagrahis, this is a matter on which views of Governors would carry greatest weight. It might be convenient and avoid demonstrations not to have a day of simultaneous gaoldelivery announced beforehand, but either without any public notice to releasesimultaneously or, if more convenient to authorities concerned, spread releasesover a fortnight or so. &apos;*- .6. These are my provisional personal views, and are subject to modificationby the comments of the Governors and Provincial Governments. I assume that,after consultation with Governors and your Council, you will let me have anofficial telegram giving your definite conclusions for consideration by WarCabinet. It would be helpful if it included up-to-date figures of persons to be released and those to be retained.i. A:      - (4) JTelegram from Government of India, Rome Department, to Secretary of State forIndia, dated November 8, 1941.(Important.)6221. Following telegram issued Provincial Governments to-day isrepeated for information. Begins: Home Dept.- Addressed to all Local Govern-ments and Administrations. :Governor-General has given full consideration toreplies of Provincial Governments and Chief Commissioner to Home Dept. letterNo. 1290-D/41, Political (I)-(C) of August 30th, 1941, on the subject of releaseof Satyagrahi prisoners. It is clear from these replies that policy hithertopursued towards movement has been almost entirely successful and that move-ment is now in a moribund condition. It is equally clear that, if gravity of the challenge (? offered) by Congress had not been recognised in the first instance and suitable measures taken, the situation would have worsened and become seriouslyprejudicial to the conduct of the war. The policy of the Government is thusvindicated, and it is now possible to reconsider this policy in the light of presentconditions. The Government of India believe that there is a general dispositionin the country to abandon this movement if an opportunity is given, and this view is confirmed by the fact that the great majority of members of Congress working committee and of ex-Ministers and other leaders are now free, and that few ofthose who have been imprisoned have shown any disposition to repeat the offence.The majority of these remaining under imprisonment or detention are unim-portant persons whose freedom would make little difference to the prospects of a revival of the movement. The policy of merely scaling down sentences, such as isfavoured by some Governments, would in (? these) circumstances yield no political advantage. On the other hand, although the majority of these prisoners have little time to serve, a general release of such prisoners, while involving littlesacrifice of principle at this stage, would, in the opinion of Government of India,be generally accepted as a gesture which would enable the Opposition to abandon the whole movement. The Government of India would, therefore, so far as thematter rests with them, be inclined to order immediate release of all Satyagrahiprisoners or detenus. (? They) (\ recognise), however, that the great majority ofthese cases are within the sole jurisdiction of Provincial Governments, who inthis respect have followed a common policy with the Central Government, andthat any change in this policy must be a matter of general agreement. before making any announcement on this subject, therefore, or taking action in areasunder Central control they would be glad to (? know) whether the Provinces wouldbe prepared to adopt corresponding measures in regard to prisoners under their control.2. Tu making (? this) proposal the Government of India have given full weight to objections raised by several Provinces to any policy likely to undermine the effect of the sentences imposed by the Courts for such &quot;activities and to the
wider objections urged in some cases against any (? general) (? amnesty). Onconsiderations of general policy, however, the Government of India are ofopinion that opposition (? .ekaafiDJ^a^Jia.xfiadv. to respond to a gesture of the kind proposed and thaTit is justifiable to accept such risks as are involved. They wish,-howeverpto &quot;inaKe it clear&apos;that this policy would in^no^vva^ihWlW^cquiescencein any revival of activities directed against the war effort. They would proposeindeed that after release had taken place a short period of grace should be allowed in order to enable the Opposition leaders to reconsider their position and publicreactions to development. But after this period they would (? propose) that any/ (? fresh) activities designed to oppose the war effort, whether of the same or ofa different kind, should be dealt with as firmly as before under ordinary law or(? Defence of) India Rules.3. The class of persons to whom this proposal is (? intended) to apply (? is)limited to what may be termed &quot; genuine Satyagrahi,&quot; that is to say, those (% whohave) merely (? repeated) the prescribed slogans or have accompanied this action with speeches not adding materially to the substance of the slogan itself.The Government of India recognise that in many cases the act of Satyagrahihas been accompanied by speeches of a more serious nature, in particular, speechesdissuading from enlistment in the Army. (Corrupt group) not suggest the releaseof persons convicted for activities materially (corrupt group) prescribed forroutine of Satyagrahi. But they would propose that cases of remaining prisonersconvicted or detained in connection with Satyagrahi movement should be examined individually as quickly as possible in order to determine whether thereare sufficient grounds for continued detention or imprisonment. The release of&quot;(? genuine) Satyagrahi &quot; would not be delayed while this examination wasbeing carried out. There is, of course, no intention whatever of releasingCommunists, revolutionaries or&apos; persons against whom action has been taken under Defence of India rules for serious prejudicial activities.4. Since proposed action will have little effect unless it is taken promptly,Government of India would be glad of earliest possible replies by telegram fromProvincial Government whether it is willing to fall in with policy indicated. Itwould, of course, be left to each Provincial Government to pass the orders asregards its own prisoners. Resolution on subject will probably come up fordiscussion on November 12th. Ends.(5)Telegram, from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary ofState for India, dated November 11, 1941.6299.   Provincial reports on Satyagraha for first half of October.Increased numbers of Satyagrahis&apos; released during the fortnight, includingAsaf Ali, and Pant and Shukla, ex-Premiers of the United Provinces and central provinces, have failed to effect revival of movement, which remains lifeless. only three out of fifteen members of All-India Congress Committee are still in jail,namely, Nehru, Abdul Kalam Azad and Shankar Rao Deo. Of 33 ex-Premiersor Ministers convicted or detained, only eight remain in custody, three in theUnited Provinces, two in Bombay, one each in Madras, Bihar and Assam.Discontent at present form of Satyagraha is widespread both among the rank and file and, privately, among the majority of the leaders. Many of the lattersaw Gandhi in recent meetings at Wardha, but have so far failed to shake his conviction, and it remains to be seen if any form of revolt from his leadershipwill materialise.(6)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated November 12, 1941.(Immediate.)2832-S. Personal. Release of prisoners. I have now heard from allGovernor(?s omitted) except Assam. All agree to policy proposed (subject toquite minor qualifications in one or two cases) excepTX?&quot;&apos;Hallett) and Hope.   I
repeat to you separately, as, in fairness to them, you ought to know their views,telegrams received in reply to my -personal enquiry of Haliett and Hope. Hallett&apos;?Government have taken much the same line in reply to Government of India&apos;;,official telegram.   I have not yet had the Madras Government&apos;s reply.2. We agreed in Council to-night that it would be impossible to show our hands on Joshi&apos;s motion to-morrow because (a) we have not views of all Govern-ments, and would (? first) have finally to settle policy in the light of them andpass our views (? to you); (6) matter (? would have to) go to Cabinet.In these circumstances, arrangements are being made for motion to be post-poned until 17th and Session of Assembly to be prolonged till then. I hope toget off official recommendation to you on (? night of) 13th or morning of 14th. I trust very much that if you accept it (it is likely to take line of over-rulingobjections seen by (? Hallett) and Hope), Cabinet approval might be obtained by night of 16th.  Can you give me any indication as to probability of this ?(?)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated November 12, 1941.(Immediate.)2834-S. My telegram No. 2832-S of to-day. Telegram No. 174-G, dated9th November, from Hallett. Begins: Your telegram No. 2805-S of 8th November,1941. Your Excellency is rightly doubtful whether there will be any political advantage in releasing Satyagrahis, but the whole point is what will be thepolitical disadvantage and effect on the war effort? I am not impressed by the argument that we can put them back into j ail. Government Officers, in particularthose of subordinate ranks, who have had a hard time&quot; Healing with Satyagrahis,but who, in spite of this work, had done excellently in promoting war effort, willbe profoundly depressed if, without the least sign of co-operation, by Congress,their work in defeating-the. movement is undone merely on the understandingthat they arrest Congress workers if they again offend. The Services weredepressed over Irwin-Gandhi pact, which, it must be remembered, did not makeCongress more reasonable, but gave them an opportunity to intensify agitationwith disastrous results especially in the agrarian areas of their Province. i cannot agree with the view in Home Department telegram that the release wouldinvolve little sacrifice of principle.  It would not be so regarded by our supporters.The release&apos; would also have a depressing effect on all non-officials supportingus in the war effort and cause less interest in the war effort, if not defeatismeven if Congress workers did not openly interfere with war effort, the fact thatthere had been a sudden change of policy would be interpreted as the first move to place Congress in power (vide yesterday&apos;s article in the Statesman, &quot;NewEffort to End Deadlock,&quot; and National Herald). Already there is feeling thatif Congress return to power, we shall not be able to implement our promise aboutreservation of civil posts, and that Congress will take out of those who havehelped us.3. But of primary importance is the question of effect on MoslemLejgue. What the league fears is that Government, as measure of politicalexpediency, or moral weakness, will sacrifice Moslems in order to reach agree-ment with Congress. It is because of this that Jinnah had adopted nuisancepolicy which has been more marked in recent months. They will regard thisreversal of policy as triumph of Congress, or for those Hindus who they regard as allies of Congress, such as members Of Sapru&apos;s party. It will lead Hindus invillages to become more aggressive against Moslems and cause very serious deterioration in the communal situation (this view was given by Inspector-General of Police when discussing Nehru&apos;s release). It might also have theresult of Jinnah driving Moslems into civil disobedience campaign. We shouldvery definitely be charged with an anti-Moslem policy.4. If there is general release of Satyagrahis, still about 3,000 in the united provinces, release of Azad will not matter, but I would emphasise that he was
prosecuted for inflammatory speech encouraging^mass jaivil^disobedience (videHome Department telegram 5079 of 12th December, 1940). HomeTJepartmept(fcovr do not suggest release of persons convicted of activities in excess of prescribedroutine of Satyagrahis and his case appears to come in that category. Azadis of no local importance and his release would have little effect here except asprecedent.5. If there is general release of Congress workers, damage caused will notbe very greatly increased by the release of Nehru. If not released, there will becontinuous agitation for release which will destroy any possible hope there maybe that general release will make Gandhi or Congress more reasonable. Nehru&apos;ssentence was severe, but I feel very definitely that it.had the good effect of stoppingfurther attempts.,at. agrarian agitation. You held at that time that &quot; to adoptapoTpg^ttc^i^attitude would encourage he impression that we were attempting (invain) to conciliate Gandhi and the Working Committee and they would gainprestige without any corresponding advantage to us &quot; (Telegram No. 2395-S, dated18th November, 1940). That argument applies with greater force to the present proposal. Satyagraha has not been abandoned by Gandhi and I feel therefore that Nehru will intensify the movement and will direct it on dangerous lines onwhich he attempted to start it. Of course, rearrest is possible, but it will bedifficult to convince opponents of the Government of India or Congresssympathisers in England that rearrest was essential.. Moslems, or at leastKhaksars, might draw comparison with treatment of Khaksars leader, who - isstill detained without trial.6. Home Department appear to suggest differentiation between cases of&quot;genuine Satyagraha&quot; and others. We have^already authorised DistrictMagistrates to release all harmless prisoners and to examine cases of allSatyagraha detenus and.release in suitable-eases. If Government of Indiaadvocate similar policy possibly at more rapid rate, we have no objection; butI assume that these proposals involve statement in Legislature or by other means that Government releasing all Satyagrahis. Discrimination which apparentlyHome Department suggest in paragraph No. 3 of their telegram between variousoffenders involving a-careful examination of cases will not improve position.7. I regret that I may appear unsympathetic to proposals of Governmentof India, but I and my officers feel very strongly that definite disadvantages, inparticular effect on services and on Moslem opinion, outweigh advantages which appear to be in your Excellency&apos;s view, extremely problematic. If there had been any indication of possible co-operation by Gandhi and Congress the position mightbe different. But see article in to-day&apos;s Lucknow edition of National Heraldentitled, &quot; More about policy of appeasement.&quot; United Provinces is the spiritualhome of Congress and particularly of Left Wing and we have had to bear bruntof these subversive movements. We have, I think, been successful in promotingwar effort and are (sic) also maintaining law and order in the last two years.Reversal of present effective policy will upset much we have achieved. I fully appreciate your Excellency&apos;s difficult position, but I feel also that conditions inother Provinces where movement has been less intense differ from those in theUnited Provinces. The success of the war effort of India has always been emphasised and reversal of our present policy, which appears to be implied inthese telegrams, will convey an impression that our policy has been wrong andour statements exaggerated. Capital may be made out of it by Nazipropagandists.8. For all these reasons I feel that our position, especially in a Provincesuch as United Provinces, will be made extremely difficult if anything is done to convey the impression that we are attempting to conciliate Congress. It does not affect the question that the number of persons in jail is now comparatively smallexcept possibly in the United Provinces. It does affect that we now take action which will convey the impression that we were in the wrong in the action wehave taken.9. I may add that, in view of ruling of High Court in Allahabad on thequestion of an Act preparatory to a prejudicial Act, we may have to release alarge number of our existing prisoners. To that I have no particular objection,for it will not lead to a recrudescence of the Movement. But that stands on a very different footing from the present proposals, which, as I have emphasised, convey the impression of a reversal of policy.
10. I trust Your Excellency will be good enough to convey my views toSecretary of State, for both I and my Advisers feel very strongly that present proposals will result in a very difficult situation.   Ends.(8)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State for India, dated november 12, 1941.(Immediate.)2835-S. reference my telegram No. 2832-S of to-day. Following is Hope&apos;telegram 159-M of November 10th, repeated. Begins: Your telegram 28&amp;5--Sof November 7th and telegram 6220 of November 8th from Government of IndiaHome Department to Government of Madras.2. I have consulted all Advisers, and we are unanimous in our conclusion on the question as far as we can judge it. There may, of course, be overriding-considerations such as public opinion, possibly, though unlikely, in England,but more likely in America, and our views are confined to how we see things inIndia.3. On the general merits of the question I am absolutely opposed to a whole-sale release of prisoners without a definite guarantee from Congress--that civildisobedience will be called off. I can imagine nothing more damaging to prestige of Government than release of prisoners on one hand, and sentencing of the sameor new Satyagrahi immediately after. It would make us the laughing-stock ofIndia and would deeply offend and mortify the loyalists, who might with reasonsay: &quot; Why should we help the British when they continue to run afterCongress? &quot;4. I do not believe for a moment that there is any change of heart in congress, only a desired change of tactics. This is borne out of information Ihave received about C. R.&apos;s attitude in private. In public he has said nothing ofimportance, but in private a good deal. He is very bitter against British, morethan ever, says Berlin wireless is as truthful as London or Delhi, and is hopingfor a quick Russian defeat, followed by an enforced armistice between Germanyand England, when Congress would at once launch a mass civil disobedience movement, which would bring England to her [ ? omission] and this is man whois supposed to represent moderate conciliatory elements in Congress. C. R. is animplacable foe of Britain, and his present attitude is only due to [ ? omission]Congress mistakes in recent past. G. A. Natesan has seen him several times, andadmits that if C.R. came back to power he would do minimum to help war,provided he kept on the right side of Government of India.5. You will naturally know better than I as to reactions on Jinnah, but Ishould have thought that he would consolidate his hold on his wobbling followersby pointing out that Government of India were once again playing Congressgame.6. Quite frankly, I cannot see any^ach^ntage ^whatever.in .tMs^roposedpolicy in so far as it affects the political&quot;position in India itself. As a gestureof goodwill to Congress it will be useless : and I [ ? do not] consider that sacrifice of principle is negligible at all.7. If civil disobedience goes on after release, we shall look exceedinglyfoolish. We shall certainly dishearten, possibly finally, our loyalists and friendswho have stood by us, despite every provocation and insult, and I feel, as I have said, that it will strengthen Jinnah very considerably.8. The Satyagraha movement is moribund and it will only call attention toit if interest is revived in it by proposed victory offered to Congress, as it will certainly be looked upon. I fully realise the pressure that there must be, but almost earnestly urge that this release should not take place. It will be looked upon as weakness by all sides, and I hate to think of effect on loyal non-Congresselements.9. The history of Ireland in 1916 to 1921 showed the value of gestures ofthis kind, and I certainly believe that this (corrupt group) gesture would haveworst possible results in strengthening . the Congress and dismaying our friends.

(10)Telegram from Viceroy to the Prime Minister, dated November 13, 1941.(Private and Personal.)2851-S. Your private and personal telegram No. 1344 of November 12th.We had already extended session of Assembly (due to rise on 14th November) to17th for this debate, and cannot well now extend it further. I quite understanddifficulty about meetings of Cabinet, and if it is insuperable we shall have to makethe best of it. But if it is, in fact, possible to take case in time to give a decision by night of 16th it would help me with new Council, and I should be greatlyobliged.(11)Telegram from Governor-General to Secretary of State for India, dated november 13, 1941.(Immediate.)2853-G.   Following is practically full text of press statement issued byGandhi on 12th November : &quot; I observe there is movement to press Government to release Satyagrahiprisoners. It is perhaps appropriate to mention that so far as I know there willbe on the part of Congress neh^er^^pprecmtipjL..Qf....jior response to any such ,gesture by Government. Those who may be discharged will have to be invited j\to (&quot;A f&quot;ej offer ci.viT&quot;Hisobedience if physically fit. Moreover there will be great Mresentment if distinction is made between Satyagrahis and those detainedwithout trial. Government should not be judges of what is reasonable. public demand is: let Government keep prisoners but give them decent treatmentwhether they hunger strike or not. They need not take notice of such strikeswhen there is no reasonable cause. Deoli prisoners&apos; demands as far as they are known are just. Let them end terrible suspense by granting demands and endinghunger strike. Let them also, examine recently published manifesto by medicalmen from all over India on dietary of &quot; C &quot; class prisoners and make necessary changes and redress such other disabilities which have no just bases. I therefore suggest to those who are urging Government to discharge Satyagrahi prisoners-that they will do well, if they will, to concentrate on relief herein suggested. It.can be granted quickly without any political or other embarrassment.&quot;C      Telegram from Prime Minister to Viceroy, dated November 12, 1941.(Strictly Personal and Secret.)1. .1 was startled to learn how far you had gone about the release of theremaining Satyagrahi prisoners. As you know, I have always felt that a manlike Nehru should be treated as a political detenu and not as a criminal, and have welcomed every mitigation of his lot. But my general impression of this wholesalerelease is one of a surrender at the moment of success. Undoubtedly the releaseof these prisoners as an act of clemency will be proclaimed as a victory forGandhi&apos;s party. Nehru and others will commit fresh offences requiring the wholeprocess of trial and conviction to be gone through again. You will get no thanksfrom any quarter. The objections of Hope and Hallett should not be lightlyturned aside.2. The Cabinet, to whom I mentioned it this evening, felt they must have more time to consider the matter after they have received your official advice.It will not be possible for us to send an answer before Monday at earliest, so I asked the Secretary of State to desire you to postpone the motion on the 17th fora few days. We often do this in the House of Commons when replies from otherGovernments have to be awaited.3.   Kindest regards.

That willenable issue to be discussed in the Cabinet on the .17th, after which perhaps you would telegraph their conclusions most immediate.(13)Telegram from Prime Minister to Viceroy, dated November 14, 1941.(Personal and Secret.)No possibility of Cabinet decision before Monday at earliest. All yourtelegrams and those of Governors are being studied.(14)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated November 14, 1941,repeating telegram from Governor of United Provinces.(Immediate.)2879-S. Following telegram from Governor of the United Provinces,G.181, 13th November, is repeated for information : Your telegram No. 2842-S,12th November. I realised that proposed release of Satyagrahis was intended not so much to placate Congress as to strengthen the hands of the Right Wing, thoughHome telegram referred to release as a &quot; gesture &quot; which would enable theOpposition (clearly the Congress) to abandon whole movement. But my view hasalways been, and still is, that publicly, it will be represented and interpreted as apolicy of &quot;appeasement&quot; of Congress. Both National Herald and Pioneeralmost invariably refer to it as such.2. Position in this Province differs from that of some others not only inmatter of number of Satyagrahis (? but also) because the Right Wing is incapable of controlling the Left which openly repudiates non-violence and because ofboycott conditions. I have no objection to releasing Satyagrahis on the groundthat Satyagraha is dead. Indeed, that is practically the policy that I have followed for some months.But I consider that the simultaneous (? release of) large number of persons whose profession is agitation in circumstances which^ whatever may be the exactpolitical motives behind them, will be regarded as victory for those opposing theGovernment and the war, would have very dangerous effect on peace of theProvince and of certain districts, in particular Cawnpore. My view previouslyexpressed about the Moslem attitude is corroborated by ian article by a specialcorrespondent on the Pioneer headed: &quot;If Congress Party is &apos; appeased&apos;,&quot;which appeared on the 11th November, from which I quote the following:&apos;&apos; League circles feel that if any attempt was made to force things the Leaguewould not hesitate to play the same role which Congress has been playing sincethe outbreak of war with the difference that the League is not bound by creedof non-violence.&quot;3. I therefore still consider that risks in the UniteolJB.roy.incea..fax.joutaEeighany political advantage that it might be hoped to gain, but, if it is decided totake them, I would most strongly urge that they be reduced to a minimum. It is,in my opinion, essential that release of Satyagrahis (? omission) gradual. Thiswill enable those released to be gradually absorbed in the mass of people and reduce to a (? minimum) the,dangers of mass demonstrations of welcome intendedto inflame the public. If this is agreed to, I can..guarantee release of genuineSatyagrahis by the 31st December.. I presume that (? except in the case)s ofAzad- and Nehru, policy proposed is that indicated in paragraph No. 3 of home departments telegram that persons convicted for activities materially in excessof prescribed routine of Satyagraha (? should not be) released.
4.   In view of decision of High Court referred to in my telegram G.(U74),paragraph No. 9, we are to-day issuing orders for release of all persons coming^within this category.   That will involve reference to records of cases by DistrictViVfagistrates and releases will be completed (? as soon as possible).   We cannotestimate numbers affected, but we do not anticipate that this will involvesimultaneous release of large numbers in any one district.5.   As regards Azad, I am prepared to agree to his immediate release.6. As regards Nehru, though I would prefer his (? detention) till he has reserved, say, 18 months, and his release in circumstances which might not be interpreted as concession to political pressure, I regard his release as far lessdangerous than the simultaneous (? release) of 3,000 local agitators.7. In conclusion, I would emphasise that gradual release will enable us tocarry out more effectively policy indicated in Home Department telegram ofdealing with persons if they renew anti-war activities. I am grateful to yourExcellency for offering to communicate my views to the Secretary of State.(15)Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State for India, dated November 15, 1941.2877-S. Personal. Following for Prime Minister. Your telegram of13th November, India Office, No. 1345. The sentences of these satyagrahis are mostly due to expire within four months, so we are not giving them much. My.,,new colleagues tell me that they have no hope that Congress will respond and I agree? They are anxious to impress moderate &quot;opinion outside Congress and to enhance their own prestige by showing that they can get things done. IncludingMoslems they were unanimous in their advice. I think that they may be right,though I confess that if left to myself I would not have favoured release, but I am quite definite that it woiihThot be wise to resist them^-Dean assure you&quot;tEaTth&quot;ereis no surrender about it, and that all my colleagues are to be relied upon to protectour war effort. You may count upon me to dig my toes in if I think they are going too far. Rumour reaches me that you hate long telegrams so I must rely upon Amery to give you further particulars.2.   Best messages.  We are in great heart here and full of fight.(16)Telegram from Government of India, Home Department, to Secretary of Statefor India, dated November 14, 1941.(Immediate.)6415.1. Replies from Provincial Governments, with two most importantexceptions, disclose complete agreement with the proposed policy of release ofthe Satyagrahis as defined in our telegram 6221, dated 8th November.Exceptions are the United Provinces and Madras in which two Provinces 2,869and 565 convicted Satyagrahis were respectively still undergoing imprisonmenton 1st October out of all-India total of 5,655 on that date. All the above figures may be assumed to have fallen considerably during October, but we havenot yet received the complete official figures as on 1st November.2. Among the Provinces that have agreed without qualification are thef Punjab (number on 1st October, 776), Bihar (number 380), Central Provinces(209 on 1st November) and Bengal Sind and the N.W.F.P. where the numbers are either nil or negligible. Bombay (number at the beginning of November onthe way to 400) attach importance to uniform action in all provinces. BothBombay and the Punjab stress the importance of the stipulation that anyrecrudescence of the movement should be treated on the same lines as previously.Orissa (64) asks for some reasonable freedom of action in regard to Satyagrahisamong the aboriginal population where special risks are involved. Assam (63)have not yet replied.
3. Objections of the United Provinces and Madras to whose opinions we agree that great weight must be attached, are largely identical. Both provincesare now carrying out the policy-of selective and gradual releases under whic0jails will be comparatively &quot;empty in a few months time, but both contest ourview that immediate release of all &quot; genuine Satyagrahis &quot; would involve littlesacrifice of principle at this stage. They maintain that such action would beregarded as victory for Congress or. at least as an attempt by the Governmentto placate that body in spite Of the fact that it has in no way altered its attitudetowards the war. Effect would be disastrous both on the Services and also onloyal sections of the population, and particularly the Moslems, who wouldinterpret the move as a surrender to anti-war Congress agitation and an attemptto bring Congress Ministries back to power. Madras point out that period ofgrace to be allowed after general release would (1 in effect) afford temporarylicence for anti-war speeches such as Gandhi originally contemplated, whileUnited Provinces consider return or fear of return of Congress Ministry wouldpractically paralyse non-official war effort and that released Satyagrahis would use their influence against recruiting. United Provinces go on to urge with someapparent inconsistency that Left Wing of Congress in United Provincesfollowing Nehru&apos;s lead would be opposed to resumption of parliamentary government and would probably resort to more serious anti-war activities(e.g., by mass action) than the company of harmless Satyagrahis to which theyhave always been opposed. In this estimate of the situation they would apparentlyregard extreme Left Wing as a strong supporter of Gandhi himself. Finally,United Provinces think it would be difficult to re-arrest Congressmen if theyresumed Satyagrapha, as such action would be treated not on its merits, but asa reverse of a policy which it would be urged had not definitely been proved a failure. They request that policy of general release be not forced on themmerely because it may suit other provinces differently situated.4. After (1 period, of) further consideration in the light of these replieswe are unanimously of opinion that our original proposal as put to Provinces, and accepted without reserve by large majority of them, should be pursued subjectto modification that in deference to views of United Provinces Government,releases should be spread over convenient period. Our conviction that this is right course has, if anything, been strengthened by Gandhi&apos;s statement, which you have no doubt seen, and in which he intimates that release of Satyagrahiprisoners will evoke no appreciation or response on the part of Congress. Webelieve his object in issuing such a statement at this stage could only havebeen to divert us from a course which may embarrass him and divide his followers.We are under no delusion as to possibility of converting Gandhi or CongressWorking Committee as such. It is not our object to placate them much less tofacilitate the return of Ministries pledged to present Congress programme. Wecannot conceive that any Government would hold office in any Province duringcontinuation of hostilities which would not be prepared whole-heartedly tosupport war effort. The whole merit of our proposal lies in appeal we hope itwill make to large body of moderate Nationalist opinion outside Congress. Wethink too it may encourage fissiparous tendencies which are already evidentwithin body of Congress itself. At the same time it affords an opportunity ofdemonstrating our confidence in our ability to ignore a defeated movement andto rally all elements in the country, whether inside or outside, in support ofGovernment as at present constituted in most energetic prosecution of the war.We do riot believe that any ill effects releases may have on Muslim or other opinionare likely to persist for more than brief period, having regard to limited characterof releases proposed. We must also make it quite clear that we have no intentionof allowing any revival of civil disobedience movement or any other anti-warmovement, and shall give fullest support to any measures that any province may consider it necessary to make against any attempt in that direction. We should certainly be in a stronger position to do so later such a gesture had been made.We believe objections of U.P and Madras are based even more on apprehendeddevelopment of a policy of appeasement than on immediate effect of releasesthemselves, and we have some hope that, if their appreciations [sic&apos;] on that scorecan be allayed they may be prepared to reconsider their attitude. It is truethat conditions in U.P. can be distinguished from those elsewhere owing bothtd far greater intensity of movement in that Province and much larger number
of releases therefore involved, and also to more militant brand of Congress doctrineprevailing there as a result of Nehru&apos;s influence. Same, however, cannot be said111: Madras, where conditions are it no way different from those in other Provinceswhose Governments must be fully aware of considerations advanced by Madrasbut have fully accepted our policy. We also find it dffiicult to appreciate whyboth these Provinces should see such a large difference between resultsanticipated from an immediate release of limited class of Satyagrahis towhom our proposal refers and selective release of most of the same persons spreadover comparatively short period of the next few months. We are asking bothprovinces to reconsider their attitude in the light of what we have said above and will telegraph further as soon as their replies are received.5. Meanwhile we propose that, if policy is approved, the effective clause)in announcement on subject should run as follows : Government have no;intention of relaxing measures they have already taken and will continue to takeagainst activities or propaganda directed against war effort or calculated topromote mass disorder. On other hand they consider it no longer necessary toretain in custody persons who have been convicted or detained, either forparticipating in civil disobedience movement or for having given notice of their intention to do so. Within this category they include not only those who merelyrecited prescribed slogan, but also those who accompanied it with a speech not materially .adding to its substance. The Government of India have therefore decided to release forthwith all prisoners and Chief Commissioners Provinceswho fall within abovlTcartegories. They have advised all Provincial governments to follow the same course, and it is expected that release of prisoners will beginas soon as possible and will be completed as soon as administrative requirementspermit.   Ends.6. As regards Nehru U.P. Government consider that, if there is to be general release Satyagrahis harm caused would not be greatly increased by his release. In fact, in their view, if he is not released, there is little hope that generalrelease will make Gandhi or Congress more reasonable. So long, however, asSatyagraha is not abandoned by Gandhi they feel that Nehru would do his best to intensify movement and direct it on dangerous lines on which he attempted to start it. Finally, if his re-arrest become necessary they consider it would bedifficult to convince opponents of Government in India or elsewhere that sucha step was essential while Muslims, or at least Khaksars, might draw comparisonwith treatment of Khaksars&apos; leader who is still detained without-trial.7. Our conclusion is that (? his) immediate release is advisable. We fully appreciate argument of United Provinces Government, and, indeed, consider it probable that his re-arrest may become necessary at an early date. We feel,however, that if even with Russia as our ally he again gives cause for action and grounds for it are given fullest publicity both in India and abroad publicopinion, especially in England and U.S.A. would realise that he must be(? constrained) and criticism of his re-incarceration would be silenced. In anycase we have no doubt that any good that may be caused by release of Satygrahiswill be largely nullified so long as Nehru remains in jail. We do not acceptcomparison between Nehru and Khaksars leader.8. Discussion of resolution in Assembly may possibly be deferred untilThusday, 18th November, but session cannot be prolonged after that date. Weearnestly hope you will be able to let us have a reply before then.
