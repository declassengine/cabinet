The objects of the discussion in Washington were : (a) To define the procedure for the preparation of local defence schemes andfor the settlement of the defence questions which may arise from timeto time.(b) To define the procedure for maintaining internal security.(c) To define the principles of command, including the nationality of the senior officer who should assume command.The essential British requirement was to retain unimpaired british sovereignty of the territories concerned.3. As a result, a draft Agreement^ has been drawn up which has beenagreed by the United States Chiefs of Staff and by ourselves.4. The Agreement covers ail the territories in which the United States haveleased bases from us, except Newfoundland. Newfoundland was excluded asbeing a special problem of its own, which it is recognised must be resolved by theUnited States-Canada Joint Defence Board and the Newfoundland Government.This Agreement does not prejudice any arrangements which may be made betweenthe Newfoundland, Canadian and American. Authorities, though it may providea useful basis for discussion.5. We suggest that the Dominions Office should be invited to communicate the Agreement to the Canadian Government. At the same time the canadian government should be asked to clear up with the Americans the position withregard to Newfoundland.6. We regard this Agreement with the Americans as a satisfactory solution to a difficult and controversial problem, and we recommend that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should confirm the Agreement. If this is done, the United StatesChiefs of Staff propose to submit it to the President for his approval.(Signed) DUDLEY POUND.J. G. DILL.C.

The Conference recognizes that the Agreement attached is made subjectto the approval of the United States and British Chiefs of Staff and subsequentconfirmation by the President of the United States and the &quot;United KingdomGovernment.3. The Agreement is based on the understanding that there shall be at all times mutual co-operation in local defense, and that, on instructions from theGovernments of both the Associated Powers, or when the Associated Powersbecome mutually associated in a war against a common enemy, there shall beunity of command of the United States and British local defense forces.4. It may be found necessary, in the light of experience, to establish a joint advisory Board at some suitable place to be agreed upon by the Associated Powers,to which Local Combined Defense Committees and Local Joint Military DefenseSub-Committees can refer points of difference for decision.5. In course of time it may be found necessary to co-ordinate the tacticaloperations of the United States Army Air Forces and the Royal Air Forceengaged in local defense at any or all of the Territories concerned by the exerciseof unity of command over these Air Forces by an Air Officer of either of the associated Powers.6. The discussions did not include a consideration of the use by a ThirdPower of the facilities of either of the Associated Powers, since this matter wasconsidered to be outside the scope of the Conference.(Signed)      HARRY J.
