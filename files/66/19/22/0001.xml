i n oi 4 0* , /(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.)SECRET..W.P. (41) 249, COPY NO27th 0ctobei%,.1941.7TAR   CABINET., .     MAN-POWER;   MAflMMBHT FOR BTOILVIDUAL DEFERMENT.1 Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service,i.    If the present system of reservation Toy occupation is replaced by a systemof individual deferment, consideration must be given to the machinery which is tobe used in determining applications for doferment.Present Machinery for Deferment.2,    All men aged 18 to 4-1 are liable to be called up for service in the armed forces.    Under the Schedule of Reserved Occupations men at .and above the ageof reservation for an occupation are in general reserved from calling-up formilitary service;   this is an administrative, not a statutory, reservation.Men he low, the age of ^reservation who arc in &quot;key&quot; positions or engaged onspecially important work- and must be retained in industry are prevented from being called up for the Armed Forces by being granted &quot;deferment&quot;.    The onlyissue that arises in determining an application for deferment is whether it isin the national interest. for the man concerned to remain on his job.      Noquestion of the man s individual position &quot;arises (see para. 7J&apos;,30    The Ministry of Labour and National Service has a widespread machine todeal with deferment applications, as will bo obvious from the fact that at1st July, 1941,- there were about 440,000 deferments current,4,    Tho procedure is&apos;as follows.    Employers desiring deferment for a man make an application on a form which is sent to tho Government Department on whose work  the employer is principally engaged, or to the Department chiefly concerned withthe goods and services which lie supplies.     The forms, together with the viewsof the Government Department concerned, are then sent to the Regional Office ofthe Ministry of Labour and National Service, where deoisions are given by officers of the Ministry.     These decisions are notified by the Regional Officeto the Government Department which has recommended deferment and an opportunityis given to that Department to appeal to the Headquarters of this Ministry,     inthe case of employees in shops, laundries and catering establishments, the applications are sent direct to the Regional Office of the Ministry of Labour and national Service, who; in cases of doubt as to whether deferment should be grantedconsult the appropriate Government Department.     There are, at present, special schemes in operation, for dealing at Headquarters, through Advisory Committees,with deferment applications in respect of various learned professions.     It isproposed to continue these schemes.     Deferment applications in respect of CivilServants would be dealt with by tho Kennct Committee.5. It will be seen that the decision is given by an officer of tho Ministry ofLabour and National Service, This machinery has worked well and has not led toany complaints either of unfairness or of bureaucracy.6,    Tho question of deferment arises at the present time in respect of men only,as there is no conscription to tho Armed Forces in respect of women.Protection of the Individual.&apos;7,    Under the armed Forces Act a man who is to be called up for tho Armed Forceshas a right to appeal to a Hardship Committee for a postponement of his calling up on the ground of exceptional hardship to himself.     Tho exceptional hardshipway relate to the position in which tho man&apos;s household or dependants will beplaced if he is called up, to other personal circumstances or to his businessi^responsabilities and interests.     The decision of a Hardship Committee is final,subject only to an Appeal to tho Umpire, and cannot be altered by the Minister,8* ^ A Hardship Committee consists of an independent Chairman appointed by the minister of Labour and National Service and two other persons selected frompanels of employers and workpeople..
9.    Under the Defence Regulations the Minister of Labour has power to direct any person, man or woman, to take any job at the &quot;rate for the job&quot;.     This is a question of transfer from a less essential employment to a more, essential employment and has no relation to deferment, whichis concerned solely with deferring a man s calling up to the ArmedForcese10*   A man or woman so directed has a right of appeal to a Local AppealBoard which is constituted similarly to the Hardship Committee referredto above.     The Board advises either that the transfer should take placeor that it should not.     The Boards conclusions are, in form,recommendations to the Minister, not decisions, but are adopted in practically all cases.Machinery for Individui.    eferroent.11,     I propose to develop the existing deferment procedure of the Ministry ofLabour and National Service to take the heavier load that individual defermentwill involve.     The Chairman of the Man-Power Committee has suggested that local Tribunals should be set up to give decisions on deferment,     I realise the political argument in favour of Tribunals but I do not think that suchTribunals are x^acticable.     They would have to deal with about 200,000 cases a month and about 750 Tribunals would be required.     The Tribunals would haveto sit continuously and I do not thj.nl: that the number of suitable personsrequired is available, nor d.o I think that it is practicable for officers ofthe Supply and Service Departments to be made available for the purpose cfgiving continuous evidence before the Tribunals,     Such a system would inevitably cause delajr and would involve Departments and employers in an enormous amount of work in preparing cases.     Also, it would not be possibleto give Tribunals information as to the work on which many of the firms are engaged and they would in consequence often give wrong decisions.     Localconsiderations would weigh with the Tribunals and there would inevitably be. local influence and local prejudice.     There would also be lack ofuniformity in the decisions of the many Tribunals.     Finally the recommendationsof the Supply or other Departments would have to be made and justified beforethe Tribunals which would thus be given a control over the extent to which theviews of those Departments should be accepted, unless the Minister is preparedto over-rule the Tribunals.12,     It is necessary in coming to a decision on individual deferment to haveregard on the one hand to the military requirements and on the other to industrial requirements.     The authority giving decisions must command localrespect as a competent and impartial body, have a close knowledge of localindustrial establishments, be readily available for consultation by employersand trade unions, and make its decisions promptly.   It is, I think, obviousthat decisions should not be given by officers of comparatively low rank.I want to emphasize that in giving decisions the only question that arises is whether it is in the national interest for the men to remain in industry or tobe called up for the Armed Forces, and I must retain my right to determinethis issue.     No question   of the man&apos;s individual rights are concerned;these are already preserved and if it is decided that he should bo called uphe still has a right of appeal to a Hardship Committee on grounds of personalhardship.13.     With these considerations in mind I propose to decentralise the deferment procedure still further and to set up about 50 District Man-PowerBoards rather on the lines of the Labour Supply Committees which I establishedlast year.     Each Board would control the man-power activities of a group oflocal offices with common industrial interests and would consist of(l) A Labour Supply Officer, who would co-ordinate the activities ofLabour Supply Officers and Inspectors for the district and advise on the withdrawal of men from industry.   In general he would be theChairman (or sometimes a member) of the existing Labour supply committee and while being temporarily on the staff of theMinistry of Labour and National Service, would be cither an employer ora trade union official who had been brought in from industry.
(2) A Military Recruiting Officer, who would be the local officer at&quot;present in charge of the Military Recruiting Branch of theMinistry of Labour and National Service, and whose duty it would beto loolc after the needs of the Armed Forces.    In most cases he would bea permanent civil servant.(3) A Deferment Officer who would be a neutral person recruited wherever possible from outside the Department.   He would hold the balance between the Labour Supply Officer and the Military Recruiting Officer,and the responsibility for making recommendations on cases in thelight of the labour supply and military recruiting considerations would rest largely on him.(/(.) The Board would be presided over by a Chairman, who would be anOfficer of the Ministry of Labour and National Service.     He would exercise, on behalf of the Minister, his powers under the NationalService Acts, and would be in charge of the deferment procedure.In a number of cases he would be a person who had been brought intothe Department from outside, and would not be a permanent CivilSex-vent.14, Applications by employers for the deferment of their employees would bema.de as at present and the Supply and other Departments concerned would eithersponsor the applications or would bo consulted in accordance with the existing arrangements, Cases would be considered by the Board and a decision given bythem. Where industries have local joint committees, the Board could consult them. An opportunity, as at present, will be given to the Government Departmentinterested to appeal to&apos; Headquarters of the Ministry against decisions of theBoard.15.     In proposing the machinery outlined above, to deal with applications forthe individual deferment of men at present liable for military service, I havehad in mind the possibility that it might be required to deal with defermentapplications in respect of men made liable to military service as the result of raising the present age from 41 to 60.     If women are made liable for militaryservice, it is not anticipated that It would be necessary to call up any largenumber of women at present engaged on work ofurgent national importance, andtherefore applications for the deferment of their call-up, on the grounds of thenational interest, would be few.     Such applications would either be dealt with at Headquarters, or, if experience showed that it was more convenient, from thepoint of. view of administration, to deal with them at the District Offices, a woman&apos; deferment officer would be added to the Boards.16. As regards industrial transfer no question of deferment arises, but Ipropose that the present arrangements for consultation with the Departmentsconcerned&apos;should be continued and if necessary developed.E.B.27th Gcloter, 3.941.H.Q.864-70 J.K.
