Printed for the War Cabinet, October, 1941 ( (SECRET. - rtA--                                                                       Copy No. 23W.P. (41) 240i$th October, 1941TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY&apos; /     &apos;It is requested that speciaFcare may be taken to ensure the secrecy of this document.\ zvw:WAR CABINETPOLICY WITH REGARD TO ETHIOPIAMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. At the meeting of the War Cabinet on 9th June last my memorandum .P. (41) 124 was approved, subject to a minor amendment to the title of thehigh official (mentioned in paragraph 6) who was to exercise authority in theformer Italian Colonies and supervise all British activities in Ethiopia, andSir Philip Mitchell returned to Ethiopia with instructions to &quot; sound the Emperorwith a view to arriving at an understanding with him on the issues involved &quot;(W.M. (41) 58(4) of 9th June, 1941). The War Cabinet further agreed that sir Philip Mitchell should send a full report on the Emperor&apos;s reactions andany development in the position, and that if there were any difficulty in obtaining the Emperors willing acceptance of a scheme on the lines proposed the matter should be referred to the War Cabinet.2. Sir Philip Mitchell discussed the proposed basis of agreement with theEmperor and telegraphed a draft agreements which the Emperor was preparedto accept, and which in my judgment fell within the terms of the War Cabinet&apos;conclusions.3. On receipt of this telegram discussions took place between my depart-ment and the Foreign Office, and it then appeared that the Foreign Officedesired reconsideration of Sir Philip MitcheH&apos;s proposals. Further discussionsfollowed between the Foreign Office and my department in the course ofwhich I went far towards meeting the counter-proposals put forward by theForeign Office, always subject to the inclusion of military safeguards whichshould be accepted as adequate by the G.O.C.-in-C, East Africa, and by sir philip Mitchell. The counter-proposals put forward by the Foreign Officeenvisaged financial control exercised solely by the Emperor as opposed to sir philip Mitchell&apos;s suggestions under which a considerable direct and indirectcontrol of the Ethiopian budget was reserved to the British representative.4. As a result of this inter-departmental discussion, advantage was taken of the presence in London of the Minister of State to convene a ministerial meeting on 26th September, attended by the Foreign Secretary, the Secretaryof State for the Colonies, the Minister of State and myself. The conclusions ofthis meeting are set out in the Annex to this paper. They included priyisosfor obtaining the observations of General Platt and Sir Philip Mitchell upona draft agreement for submission to the Emperor before that agreement was placed before the War Cabinet for approval. I have now consulted GeneralPlatt and I have received a telegram from Sir Philip Mitchell.! From theadvice I have received it is clear that the basis on which the Foreign office proposals rest is far from being in accordance with local conditions in Ethiopia,and would not provide for a reasonably stable administration in that country.Should these proposals be implemented, both General Platt and Sir PhilipMitchell are of opinion that chaos would result; this would involve a military* Telegram OET/19/6/A/4, dated 6th August, 1941.f No. 10/6/4, dated 6th October, 1941.
commitment of unpredictable proportions; for such a commitment we havenot the forces available in East Africa, and our whole military position inthe Middle East would be seriously embarrassed by the necessity of providing additional forces to maintain an adequate degree of security in Ethiopia.5. Sir Philip Mitchells telegram contains a solution on the basis of dividing the heads of administration in Ethiopia into transferred and reserved subjects.These proposals seem to me still to fall within the terms of the Cabinet decisionof 9th June. They are, moreover, acceptable to the Emperor, and they providefor the military safeguards required by the G.O.C.-in-C, East Africa. It maybe possible in discussion to modify these proposals to some degree in order tomeet the views of the Foreign Office, but I cannot accept the responsibility ofsuch modification without detailed consultation with Sir Philip Mitchell, whoalone is in a position to explain the local repercussions of decisions taken inLondon. In any case, in the light of the divergence of view between myself and the Foreign Secretary, I suggest that the Cabinet will need Sir PhilipMitchells advice, and that he should, therefore, be brought home immediatelyfor consultation. I would further suggest that my colleagues should defer adecision on the problem of Ethiopian administration until Sir Philip Mitchellhas given them the benefit of his views.D. M.SECRET.ANNEXETHIOPIAConclusions of a meeting held on 26th September, 1941The meeting agreed as follows:  (A) The Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for War would recommend to the Cabinet that Ethiopia should be treated not as aProtectorate but as an independent state subject to the necessarysafeguard and provisions.(B) Pending the conclusion of a formal treaty His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould conclude an agreement with the Jsmperor. This agreement would contain, inter alia, the following provisions:  (i) Such safeguards as may be necessary to meet the military requirements of the General Staff (on this point, the observa-tions of General Platt were awaited).(ii) Control of essential communications.(iii) Reservation of certain areas under British military adminis-tration.(iv) Jurisdiction; British judges to be provided in cases where anon-Ethiopian is before the court.(v) British subjects to be appointed political, financial and judicialadvisers at the Emperor&apos;s request. 1(vi) His Majesty&apos;s Government to have the power to withholdpayment of instalments of the subvention on due cause.(C) His Majesty would be advised to appoint a diplomatic representativeaccredited to the Emperor.Procedure, etc. (D) Before these proposals were submitted to the War Cabinet the termsof the draft agreement should be examined inter-departmentally.When this has been done and the reply from General Platt referredto in (B) (i) above has been received, the scheme should be trans-mitted to Sir P. Mitchell for his comments. Thereafter War cabinet approval would be sought for the agreement to be concluded and brought into operation at an early date.(E) The Foreign Office should consult with the appropriate departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the selection of officers for appointment as advisers, mentioned in (B) (v) above.(F) The Minister of State should be invited to pay a visit to the Emperorat Addis Ababa.(b41/66)   60   10/41   w.o.p.   9048
