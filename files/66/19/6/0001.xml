THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.     .. &amp;secret copy No.W.P. (41) 233.October 5, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.ACTION OF THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES  IN occupied territory.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I HAVE been considering what account we ought to take of the presenteffervescence iin the German-occupied territories in Europe and the ruthlesscounter action of the German authorities.2. The first point is whether we should incite the occupied peoples to renewattempts at resistance and sabotage, or urge them to go slow. My feeling is thatwe ought to damp down and avoid any incitement for the time being so far as this can be done without actively discouraging resistance. Otherwise, some ofthe most useful elements among the occupied peoples&apos; may lose their lives orliberty in premature efforts. What is required is the continuance of passive resistance and even sabotage, but not insurrection, except in a country like Yugo-slavia, where it has a fair prospect of maintaining itself.3. A.-second question is whether we should declare that we intend to huntdown and try individual Germans-who are concerned in the present atrocities.There is some Parliamentary interest in this question. I am convinced that weshould avoid-commitments to &quot; try the war criminals &quot; and to &quot;hang the Kaiser[alias Hitler).&quot; I am fortified in this opinion by the experience of that ill-starredenterprise.at the end of the last war. Long lists of war criminals were preparedby the Allies in accordance with part 7 of the Treaty of Versailles, but, whenthe carrying out of the provisions for trial by Allied courts was considered, thedifficulties were seen to be insuperable and the scheme was abandoned. In theend a limited number of people was tried by the German Supreme Court, but Ido not recall that any death sentences were imposed. One major difficulty is theextent to wljich subordinate officials can be !held personally responsible for actsdone under orders. More.generally, niy feeling is that the commitment to huntdown and try many thousands of Germans after the war may be as embarrassingas, for exarnpip, a commitment in favour of any particular frontier. We can,I think, safely leave the Germans to the vengeance of their neighbours and we wish to keep our hands free to take any action we may consider appropriate atthe end of the war. I am doubtful of the efficacy of threats and propaganda, atleast until there is some immediate prospect of being able to carry them out.4. I do not, however, propose that we should refrain from all action, and i suggest that we and the Allied Governments should place ourselves on record byissuing a formal collective declaration concerning the German action in occupied territory. This, while avoiding specific threats^ should have a useful effect in propaganda, both to the occupied territories and to other countries. I have11504   [22986]
prepared a draft of a declaration for this purpose, and, if my colleagues agree,1 propose to circulate it without delay to the Dominion and Allied Governmentsunder cover of the annexed note, and ask for their concurrence.5. I would propose also to enquire whether the United States Governmentwould be willing to associate themselves in some form with the declaration.A. E.Foreign Office, October 5, 1941.ANNEX.Draft note to the Heads of Allied Missions in London.Your Excellency,HIS Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom have been consideringthe situation created by the measures of repression being exercised by the german authorities in the occupied territories of Europe, and. in particular by the practice which is growing up of shooting hostages in alleged retaliation for acts of resistance by the population of those territories.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have reached the conclusion that some formalnotice ought to be taken of this situation, and that it might be well to issue a collective declaration concerning the German action. At the same time HisMajesty&apos;s Government consider that it would be inadvisable in such a declaration to make at this stage any specific threats of reprisal.3. A draft declaration has accordingly been prepared, a copy of which isenclosed for the information of the Government, and I havethe honour to enquire whether the Government are in generalagreement with this proposal, and if so whether they have any observations tooffer on the terms of the draft.Draft Declaration.When the German invaders, in their lust for conquest, attacked and enslavedthe various European countries now under the German yoke, they no doubt hopedthat the peoples of these countries, in the depths of their despair, would yieldwithout resistance; would allow themselves to be pillaged and starved in thename of Hitler&apos;s New Order; and would passively submit to the destruction oftheir national heritage.2. Despite brutal methods of deportation and confiscation, these hopeshave been falsified. The German authorities now realise that they cannot destroy the souls of these peoples even though they may possess themselves of their bodies,lands and possessions. Thus, thwarted in their plans, and alarmed at the intenseand passionate hatred that they have aroused, they are now in panic resorting to acts of undisguised terrorism and&apos; murder. Innocent persons are held ashostages and murdered indiscriminately in alleged&apos; retaliation for the action ofpatriots endeavouring to uphold their national independence against the Germanoppressors. These methods will not break the spirit of the enslaved peoples. It is certain that they have earned for the German name scorn and disgust throughoutthe world.3. The Governments of the United Kingdom, &amp;c, and the Eree french national Committee now therefore publicly declare that the brutalities which arebeing committed in the occupied countries are contrary to the dictates of humanity; are a reversion to barbarism; and will meet with retribution, sure,sudden, and complete.
