THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.Copy No.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK ATND KEY.It is requested that special care maw be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT&apos;S GOLD RESERVE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 14th May last the Defence Committee considered a proposal thatthe Egyptian Government&apos;s gold reserve should be removed to India for safety.At that time, though the Bank of England and the Treasury were anxious that the gold should be removed, the Defence Committee felt that (a) it wasin no real danger, and (b) news of its removal would leak out and add to the wide-spread defeatism in Egypt.The Committee, therefore, decided to await developments in the western desert, and the Prime Minister decided thai? the matter should be deferred. HisMajesty&apos;s Embassy in Cairo were informed in this sense.Meanwhile the Egyptian Government had authorised the National Bank ofEgypt to make unobtrusive preparations for moving the gold to India, on theassumption that His Majesty&apos;s Government would guarantee them against loss in transit. The Egyptian Government were told that no such guarantee could begiven.All through the summer, however, the Egyptian Government have made itclear that they would be unwilling to move their gold in the absence of such aguarantee.The Treasury have now reached the conclusion that it would be desirable togive the guarantee in order to get the gold moved.There is a lull in the fighting on the Western Desert and removal ought notto excite undue Egyptian comment. If the gold is removed to India our hold onthe Egyptian Government will, if anything, be greater.I therefore advise that His Majesty&apos;s Government give the requiredguarantee.A.  E.Foreign Office, October 17, 1941.11518   [23027]
