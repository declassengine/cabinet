THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   October 1941.SECRET. Copy No.W.P. (41) 241.October 15,, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK and KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.POLICY WITH REGARD TO ETHIOPIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 16th May and the 9th June last the War Cabinet had before themmemoranda by the Secretary of State for War on the form of administration tobe adopted in Ethiopia (W.P. (G) (41) 49 and W.P. (41) 124). The conclusions on administration were :-(a) To hand over Ethiopia to its rulers as a Native State.   There was no need for us to concern ourselves unduly as to how it was governed(Conclusions 50 (41) of the 16th May), and(b) Subject to its being made clear to the Emperor that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were anxious to give him every opportunity to make a real success of his restoration to the throne, Sir P. Mitchell was to sound him personally on the issues involved in the Secretary of Statefor War&apos;s memorandum of the 6th June with a view to arriving atan agreement on those issues. Sir P. Mitchell was asked to send afull report for submission to the War Cabinet describing the Emperor&apos;sreactions and any developments in the position (Conclusions 58 (41)of the 9th June).2. Following discussions with the Emperor, Sir P. Mitchell drafted anagreement, which, he informed the Secretary of State for War, the Emperorwas prepared to sign. My department had doubts about some of the provisionsof this draft, and there were indications later, from other sources, that theEmperor was not, in fact, in agreement with all of Sir P. Mitchell&apos;s proposals.The Foreign Office, therefore, suggested to the War Office that Sir P. Mitchellshould be asked to explain how he proposed Article 9 (a) and (b) (reproduced inAppendix I) should be carried into effect. His replies, coupled with the form ofthe budget for Ethiopia drawn up by the Controller of Finance and Accounts on sir P. Mitchell&apos;s staff, made it clear that this draft agreement implied an extremely close protectorate. My department drew the attention of the WarOffice to this undesirable development, which seemed to them contrary to thepolicy indicated by the War Cabinet. The War Office, having felt unable toaccept this construction put on Sir P. MitchelFs proposals, the issue was put to a ministerial meeting on the 26th September, attended by Lord Moyne, CaptainMargesson, Mr. Lyttelton and myself.3. This meeting agreed unanimously that Sir P. Mitchell&apos;s proposals,particularly those which referred to the degree of financial control to be exercised by His Majesty&apos;s Government and to the relationship of the advisers to theEmperor, constituted a virtual protectorate. The meeting indicated the lines which, in its view, the agreement should take. It followed generally the draft11515   [23017] b
of which Sir P. Mitchell had communicated parts to the Emperor, but it avoidedthose parts which provided for direct control by our representative. In particular the point was stressed that the advisers, although they should have access to theBritish diplomatic representative, would be responsible solely to the Emperor, andthat control should be exercised not in the day-to-day financial administration, butby means of a lump sum grant (on the Foreign Office Vote), which could be turnedon or off at the source. Subject to the safeguarding of essential military require-ments, Ethiopia would become an independent State and, as such, would passout of the control of the O.E.T. administration. Accordingly my department, inconsultation with the War Office, drew up a fresh draft (Appendix II).4. The War Office consulted Sir P. Mitchell on certain points arising outof this new orientation. In his reply (the 6th October), he stated that he hadalready issued instructions to the effect that the &apos;&apos; Advisers are British Officersand have residual obligations to pursue the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government.They can obtain guidance on that from the British representative. Additionally,the financial adviser must have instructions from the Controller of Financesthrough me (Sir P. Mitchell) as to the nature and extent of control His Majesty&apos;sGovernment desire to exercise over taxation and expenditure.&quot;5. It is quite obvious that Sir P. Mitchell would wish to set up an administration on the lines of that created by the Italians or for a British colony and hope to train up Ethiopians in time to take it over. This might explain the fear he expressed that there are not enough sufficiently educated or trained per-sonnel among the Ethiopians to undertake the administration for, he says, &quot; Weshall have to do most of the work or it will not be done until we can trainEthiopians.&quot;6. My view, which has the support of those persons having considerable experience of Ethiopia before the Italian occupation, whom my department have consulted, is that this form of fostering an Ethiopian administration can onlylead to grave hostility to us, which would, first, make excessive demands on our military resources, and, secondly, provide ground for dangerous criticism at homeand abroad of such a policy. That the seeds of such hostility have already beensown is indicated in letters received here from the Emperor. (A copy of one willbe found in Appendix III.)7. I recommend, therefore, that our policy should be to return to the formulaof the Prime Minister (Cabinet Conclusion 50. (41)) quoted in the first paragraphat (a) and hand the administration of the country to the Emperor on the terms ofthe draft agreement (Appendix II), which, whilst preserving the Emperor&apos;ssovereignty, provides all the safeguards we can hope to obtain in respect of such our military needs essential.:&quot; A. E.Foreign Office,October 15, 1941.

While at Khartoum we replied toall the letters you wrote to us and sent you important papers. The reason why we were not able to write to you in detail since is because we were heavily occupied with the war and also because we realized the difficulty of communication. Now,as Brigadier Sandford, who has been with us, is returning to London for a short time, we have asked him to take letters for us, and trust you will receive all.So we are writing the situation in detail as you will find hereinafter. ....2. After our arrival in Khartoum we began discussions with General Platt,the G.O.C. in the Sudan, in order to be able to obtain the promised war materials and the assistance of aircraft as much as possible. After many days had passedunder guise of making preparations, General Wavell, who was Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, came to Khartoum on his way to Nairobi, and we had a talk with him. General Wavell again told us that our arrival there was unexpected,and gave us to understand that our entry into Ethiopia without sufficient armswould be harmful both to ourself and our people, and the promised assistance was not forthcoming. In the circumstances, Brigadier Sandford, with whom wehad intended to go with whatever help could be got, was selected as head of theBritish Military Mission, and made to go in advance into Gojjam with other british persons. The reason for this was said to be that it Avould be better ifhe went ahead both to estimate the extent of the assistance that would be required and to investigate conditions in the country. As we had a strong desire to enterEthiopia, we did not like his separation from us. In the end, we decided tosend some of our men such as Azaj Kebada with the party.3. In the meantime, we caused proclamations to be published and scatteredby aircraft announcing our return to our people and warriors and urging them
to continue to unite their efforts. As soon as they heard our voice, manywarriors sent their messengers one after another. Others came themselves, and,finally, the messengers of the Goj jam warriors came in large numbers. Those who )Jcame were able to obtain rifles with much difficulty and went back. But thenumber of rifles issued was only of propaganda value and not sufficient for war purposes. &apos;While this was going on Mr.. Eden, who had come to Egypt, visitedKhartoum as well, and we were able to acquaint him of the situation. Among thethings we told him was one which we deemed important, namely, our desire tohaveDthe Eritrean refugees and the other warriors who were in Kenya to accompany us as our bodyguard, irrespective of whether assistance was forth- ))coming or not. But, although Mr. Eden had given orders concerning them andhad given consideration to the idea that the men should arrive quickly to accompany us, they have not come to us yet. Now, when this Note is beingwritten, these men are found at Debra Markos.4. While at Khartoum it was thought that, in addition to those who were coming from Kenya, other soldiers might be trained, but, in spite of the manydiscussions we had on the subject, nothing adequate was done, and in the end wehad to enter Ethiopia with only a few men.5. We entered Ethiopia through Belaya in Gojjam. Brigadier Sandfordwas then in Gojjam, and, as he found out while he was there, the people hadbeen demanding for the return of their Emperor even if no assistance was available in war materials; and we know that he had reported to the superiorBritish Military Commanders that any more delay in returning on our part would be harmful. When the time came for us to enter Ethiopia, it was notpossible to know in full and in detail what had been prepared, but as the datewas fixed on which it was said it was necessary to start, and although theassistance we had been hoping for was unobtainable, we set off on the appointed day, as it was for that day that we had been waiting; but we did not even have asufficient bodyguard for the campaign at the time.6. On our arrival in Belaya with much difficulty, we sent word to Gojjamand other parts of the country, and the warriors assembled, and those who came to us for rifles and ammunition were able to obtain a little. While we were inBelaya conversations were begun concerning the administration to be established in those parts of Ethiopia which would be occupied by British troops during the campaign. After exchanges of notes on the way, an agreement was reached, aswill be seen in the enclosed Notes. That the agreement was not, and is not,observed is shown by what the British Military Commanders have done fromtime to time and from what is to be done in future.7. As we arrived at Debra Markos it was learned that the South african troops had pushed through Harar and1 arrived in Addis Ababa. As Addis Ababawas nearer to us than to anybody else, it is not difficult to understand why it wasthat we were not avowed to reach there first. Besides the decision to make ouradvance slow, Fitaurari Berou, who was instructed to go straight to Gondar, wasmade to follow our route and pass through Gojjam by way of Belaya. TheMetemma and Quara road, which is nearer to Gondar from Khartoum, was thenfree.8. While we were at Debra Markos is was said that there were manyItalians in Addis Ababa, and our march was delayed for various reasons. More-over, the Officer Commanding the South African troops, General Cunningham,issued in his own name in Harar the Proclamation called &quot; No. 3,&quot; which was drawn up in accordance with the agreement. And when we arrived in addis ababa we found that not only the South African Commander, but Brigadier Lush,who had been appointed Political Officer in Addis Ababa, had issued Proclama-tions and Notices in a way which is inconsistent with our freedom and with thepromises of the British Government.9. As they give military necessity as the reason for doing this we have hadto exercise patience, and although it has been agreed that thereafter no proclamation-mation should be issued without the signature of the Emperor or those of the officials to whom he has given authority, it has not been possible to restrain them.
10. Moreover, the British Officers had appointed many Ethiopian officials and failed to notify us, and they have not been able to conform to the agreement, inspite of the fact that, when we speak to them, they tell us that it is not the rightprocedure.  For example :  (a) They appointed Ras Seyoum over the whole of Tigre, and it was only after much contention that he was made to come to us.(b) They included Tigre in the administration of Eritrea and had had to revoke the Proclamation appointing Ras Seyoum over Tigre and including Tigre in Eritrea.(c) They appointed Dejazmatch Haile Sellassie Gugsa in Tigre, and while we were arguing with them over this they suspended him and took himto Asmara. As he was the first to betray his country we havedemanded his surrender to us, but we have not got him yet.(d) They would not give us any of the war materials found in Ethiopia, butsend everything to Nairobi, with the exception of those that aredestroyed and lost.(e) They take away lorries and all other motor vehicles by their own free will.If it were found necessary for them to take all these things to other frontsof war we know that we ourselves ought to help them, and in spite of the factthat we have continually made it clear that we are ready to give help even withour man-power, they never tell us about the war materials they carry away.11. Being the first who arrived in Addis Ababa, they are in control of theCity Police and the official whom we have appointed Governor of the City hasbeen prevented from doing anything except to give suggestions, and they arecontrolling the arms and the money, so it has been impossible to do anything.In the City itself the white and coloured South African troops do not agree withour people and our people have been abused and humiliated under pretext of waremergency, and their homes and lives have not been respected and, as many havebeen forcibly deprived of their rights, the idea of concord is remote indeed; andwe have never ceased to bring this to the notice of the Political and military officers.12. When we send officials outside the City for purposes of administration,the British Officers in those parts prevent them from doing their duty, and, by taking into their confidence other persons in the country who support their policy,they try to lessen the authority of the officials and do things intended to sowdiscord among the people. For instance, Jimma, Wallega and Hararge are theprovinces where this sort of activity is going on systematically. In Jimma, afterthe appointment of Fitaurari Garasu Duke, to whose victorious campaign in that province both sides have testified, the British Officer there, desiring to take from him the captured lorries which were in his hands, ordered three tanks to fightFit. Garasu&apos;s men; he caused some of them to be wounded, but as the men were determined not to let themselves be robbed of the lorries the tanks returned.This happened after we had notified the British Officers in Addis Ababa thatwe wanted the lorries which were in the hands of Fit. Garasu, in the hope of avoiding such an incident.Judges were sent from both sides to investigate the incident, and after an inquiry they reported that the South Africans were the aggressors. This incidentpresents not only a sad picture of the soldiers of two so-called allies, supposedlymarching side by side and supporting one another against a common foe, fallingout with one another and one party ill-treating the other by virtue of its superiorarmament, but it also produces a spirit of dissension in Ethiopia.In the same manner,&apos;in Wallega great difficulty is experienced owing to the tension which has reached to the point of marching against one another due tothe disagreements between them and Fit. Kebeda Tessama and the officials whoare with him.13. When one watches the work of Brigadier Lush, who is in Addis Ababaas Political Officer, one cannot help thinking he has abandoned the idea offostering friendly relations between England and Ethiopia, of which the BritishGovernment and people are thinking and towards which we are labouring. Allthe fundamental things for which the British Government and people are making such heavy sacrifices in men and material seem to have been brought to nothingby the actions of Brigadier Lush. In the circumstances, it would seem[23017] &quot; c
unnecessary to place him here for Ethiopia&apos;s vital affairs. We have made it clear to Sir Ehilip Mitchell that, apart from doing things out of keeping with goodbreeding1; he is acting in a way contrary to our policy and lawful pursuits, andwe have asked him to consider the matter.14. The climax of all this is that we have informed them that the time hascome when we want to conclude a friendly treaty with the British Government,and, as the war is now over in our country with the exception of the fortress atGondar, to establish a civil administration. With this end in view we began to negotiate with Sir Philip Mitchell on his return from London, and it has notyet come to a conclusion. The Notes which will show you what stage the negotiation has reached are being sent to you herewith.The chief points of which we are thinking to bring his matter to a conclusionare as follows :  (1) Nothing to be done which might be detrimental to Ethiopianindependence.(2) That we may obtain the services of expert British advisers who willwork in the whole of Ethiopian administration as functionaries ofthe. Ethiopian Government.(3) That we may obtain the services of salaried expert advisers and military officers to reorganize our Army; but they should derive their authority from the Ethiopian Government.(4) That we may procure a loan.(5) That the British and Ethiopian Governments sign a treaty of alliance,and that the foundation be laid whereby they may be bound in policy as well as in interests.(6) That at this time, when the British people are passing through an ordeal,we may give them our assistance with whatever is found in our country, both in man power and material, including troops.The idea is to take these points as the fundamental bases and add other relevant points to them. After we submitted these proposals an interim agree-ment was proposed to us on the ground that a full agreement cannot be concluded at present. The negotiator is Sir Philip Mitchell. While we are desirous to conclude an interim agreement without losing sight of the above-mentionedpoints, and as the British who are here are under military discipline and arenot able to take up positions without special permission from their officers, weare having discussions in order that it may be possible for us to select and appointthem by recommendation of the Political Officer.Moreover, as they have told us that de facto and de jure recognition has notyet been given to the Emperor, and that de facto recognition would be accordedus as soon as the interim agreement was signed, we cannot help wondering oncomparing this with their other procedures. They have also defined matters inwhich we should implicitly be guided by the adviser. The most important ofthese is with respect to our policy towrards foreign Powers. That this kind ofprocedure does not place British policy in a clear light is evident to us. In addi-tion, they have said that they would not demand from Ethiopia more than sheis able to pay on account of the money they have spent in the country on the warand other matters. They have not so far consulted us when they bring troops intoEthiopia. As our proposals for an agreement are being sent to you herewith, youwill find the difference.During our conversations with Sir Philip Mitchell on the points of thisagreement we have emphasized strongly that we want special advisers for ourself.If it is possible to procure some from those of our British friends with whom weare acquainted they would be very useful, as they will be able to reconcile theinterests of our two countries. If this be possible, get into touch with our friends and enquire for such men who could work in the capacity of doctors and advisers,and try and send them out in agreement with the Foreign Office.15. With regard to the establishment of military administration, as youwill see from the memorandum, the authority that is required for the military commander is too heavy for an independent Government to concede. They havestated in their proposals that they would define areas which they want to be under british military administration till the end of the war, but we have not receivedthem yet.   As you will see in their proposals, they have asked that the Ogaden
be occupied by their military authorities, and you will realize how anxious weare for the territories which are nearer.16. We appreciate your suggestion as to the great usefulness of appointingrepresentatives to London and America. But, although we are alive to this, ithas proved a difficult matter to communicate even with the British Government,not to speak of the American Government, owing to the fact that it is in thehands of those who are here. As the question of a representative is to beincluded in the agreement, we shall see that the conclusion of the agreement isfollowed up with this. Far from our obtaining communication, they are seencollecting taxes in our country with their own notices and by their own employees,an action which is out of keeping with and contrary to our freedom. And we arewaiting to sign the interim agreement in the hope that all this will stop when ithas been signed.The statements in Parliament which you send from time to time are highlyuseful, so do not stop sending them.We want you to understand the political and military situations as shown above in as much detail as possible so as to enable you to acquaint our friendswho are near and, whenever you get the opportunity, those who are spectatorsfrom the distance, of the difficulty we are having and that the strong friendly relations which we desire and earnestly wish to have with England are cloudedand very uncertain owing to the actions of those who are called Political Officersand of the British Military Commanders, especially the South African Com-manders, and that we are apprehensive that these&quot; may lead to consequencesdetrimental to both sides.Written in Addis Ababa, the 14th Day of Nahase, in the Year of Grace 1933(20th August, 1941).
