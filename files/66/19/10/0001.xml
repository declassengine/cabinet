French North Africa and the Blockade.Memorandum by,, the ,Minister ofEconomic Warfare.ii   I desire to $raw the attention of my colleagues to the extentto which the authorities of Vichy Prance and French North Africaare continuing to aid the enemy and to  Tizoakea. our blqckade.2,   The Western Mediterranean Leak,The following figures show (1) the traffic which has recently arrived at French Mediterranean ports, (2) the amount of this traffic which has passed through the Straits of Gibraltar.Gross,Tonnage of Shins.Arriving at FrenchAprilMayJuneJulyTotal forfourmonthsMedite r r a no an Ports, *750,000740,00R920,000830,000Passing through theStraits of Gibraltar.135,000121,000193,000140,0003,2^0,000639,000We have details of the cargoes of only some of these ships,but our records, covering 850,000 tons, include tho following:WheatCoffeeVegetable OilsRubDorMineral OilRicoOil seeds (mostlygroundnuts)PhosphatesManganese110,000 tons30,000 tons12,000 tons,000 tons13,fi00 tons30,000 tons100,000 tons170,000 tons24,000 t$nsand smaller quantities of hides, wool, cotton, asbestos andpyrites.3e    The Saigon-Madagasoar-Dakar Traffic.In the eaply part of 194-1, the Navy intercepted a high proportion/
proportion of French ships,  - sailing to and from Indo-China.For some time, as a result, French traffic on this route stopped,But lately it has been resumed with escorted convoys.    So farone convoy of five ships totalling some 35?000 tons, which left Indo-China early in August, has arrived at Dakar andtwo of the ships have gone on through the Straits of Gibraltarto Vichy France.    A second convoy of three ships of 25,000 ,tons in all, which left Saigon early in September, has justreached Madagascar.     At least two of these are bound forFrancej    the third will probably load graphite for Japan.The Germans, deprived of the use of the Trans-siberian railway are, no doubt, exerting great pressure on Vichyto import for them essential supplies from the Far East.      Inparticular they are bound to press the French to send themrubber for which their need is acute.    Though we have no hardevidence,  it is virtually certain that rubber is beingcarried in these convoys.^-    The Use of Caronto.The port of Garonte near Marseilles has been put at thedisposal of the Axis by Vichy, and is being used almost exclusively for cargoes of phosphates,  iron ore and manganeseimported for Axis account from French North Africa andof pyrites and ores from Spain,      On arrival at Garonte mostof &quot;the phosphates and ores are sent direct by rail or bargeto Germany and Italy.    At present nine Vichy ships are plyingregularly between North Africa and Carohte.5*    The Use of Allied and Neutral Ships.Vichy have recently brought into service 63 of the 90 allied or Neutral ships detained in French ports.&apos;   Of these, 21 witha tonnage of 96,000 tons have been handed over directly tothe Axis Powers.    Others will continue to fly the French flag,but will be used in bringing Axis cargo from French north africa to Caronte and other ports.Use of Tunisian Ports.We know that Germany is pressing for the use of Tunisianports for the transit of ships and raw material.    Currentreports show that a certain amount of material for the Axisis being shipped from Marseilles via these ports.7.    Export of Cobalt from North Africa to France.It has now been made public that at the end of Augusta French ship, the s.s, &quot;St. Julienne&quot;, embarked at Nemoursand unloaded at Marseilles more than 300 tons of cobalt.    TheGermans are very short of cobalt, which they need Doth for )hardening steel and for operating some of their synthetic oil plants.   Assurances had been given to the United StatesGovernment by the French that cobalt would not be exported from North Africa.     These assurances, like many others givenby Vichy, have now been broken.    This one cargo representsmore/
more than 1P)o of Germany&apos;s minimum annual requirements of Licobalt.8&quot; Transfer of Arms and Oil to Libya.According to a recent most secret report received viaWashington,  (1) the &quot;Italian.Armistice Commission haverequisitioned 35 French 755 s from Tunis Artillery Park andhave sent them to Libya,   All old models of tanks and armoured cars have &quot;heen undergoing repairs and rearmament at Forgenoland., although 1916 motors,  they arc reported capable of 50Kilometres an hour&quot;; and. (P.) &quot;the underground gasolene dumpsat Grombalia (Gape Bon) containing 2 million litres have &quot;beenemptied and the contents transported,, by rail and road,  toGabes to supply motor trucks being delivered to Libya&quot;,    Thisexport of oil to the enemy armed forces is another grossbreach of the agreement, whereby American supplies were to&quot;be used solely for internal consumption in North Africa andnot to release existing stocks for the benefit of the enemy K9o French Aircraft Industry.The increasing extent to which Vichy is now collaboratingwith the enemy is shown by the arrangements recently madsfor putting almost the entire French aircraft industry in both the Occupied and Unoccupied Zones of Francs at thedisposal of Germany,.   All resources -. personal, material and financial - are to be pooled under an OrganisationCommission, which is itself answerable to the Reich AirMinistry *    The latter reserves the right to nominate anddismiss French representatives on the Commission,,Only one-sixth of the combined output is allocated to the French and even this, with miner exceptions, is tobe stored under German control, deliveries being permitted&quot;as and when the requirements of French reconstruction makeit desirable&quot;.    The programme aims at a production of 3?600aircraft during the 15 mouths beginning April 1SU1o   an output of 300 aircraft per month is expected by July 1942.10. United States Observers.When His Majesty&apos;s Government reluctantly agreed a fewmonths ago to the proposals of the United States Governmentto send supplies to French North Africa, we hoped to obtain a&quot;solid quid pro quo&apos;; in the form of a number of Americanobservers who,  stationed in French North Africa, were to supervise the carrying out of the agreement, to provide us with useful information and to carry out pro-Ally propaganda.Up to date our experience has been very disappointing.    TheAmerican observers, under Mr.Murphy, have done exceedinglylittle under any of these heads.I have felt it to be mysee this sombre picture. AtProposals.    We are trying to duty to let my colleaguesthis stage, I make no freshconvince the United States .Government/
Government of the daggers of making further unrequitedconcessions to Vichy, and discussions are taking place,&quot;between the Foreign Office, the Admiralty and the Ministryof Economic Warfare on the possibility of intercepting .French ships,H.D.Ministry of Economic Warfare.1Oth october ,1941.
