THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the War Cabinet.   November 1941.. It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.WAR CABINET.HiSECRET. J Copy No.   29W.P. (41) 269.November 12, 1941.TO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.PUBLICATION BY THE PRESS OF ARTICLES LIKELY TO PREJU-DICE THE RELATIONS OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT WITHFOREIGN POWERS.Joint Memorandum by the Foreign Secretary, the Home Secretary and theMinister of Information.WE were invited by the Cabinet on the 9th October to consult together onthe measures which might be taken to prevent the publication by the Press ofarticles likely to react unfavourably on this country&apos;s relations with foreign powers.1. During the last war there was a Defence of the Realm Regulationmaking it an offence to &quot; spread reports or make statements intended or likelyto prejudice His Majesty&apos;s relations with foreign Powers.&quot; During the first16 months of the war it was the practice of the newspapers to submit material for censorship so as to avoid the risk of contravening this Regulation. Materialso submitted was occasionally sent to the Foreign Office direct, but more oftenwas submitted to the Press Bureau,* which either gave a decision or referred thematerial to the Foreign Office for decision. As time went on grave objections were felt to this censorship, and it was discontinued in December 1915. It was,however, the practice of the Foreign Office when they heard that dangerousmaterial was likely to be published, to telephone to the newspaper and explain the objections. The conclusion reached by the Foreign Office at the end of thewar was that this gentle guidance proved far more effective than censorship.2. At present there is no Regulation corresponding to the Defence of the realm Regulation quoted above, but the News Department of the Foreign Officeadvises the press both on the accuracy of its material and on the advisability of publishing it. Most papers are co-operative, and this procedure is effective over alarge field. There are, however, a few papers, including the Daily Mirror, whoseeditors would no doubt contend that on certain subjects their estimate of whatserves the national interest is more accurate than that of the Government. Forinstance, the Daily Mirror would allege that restraint and moderation in con-nection with Spain are symptoms of a mistaken policy of &quot; appeasement.&quot;3. The Secretary of Statet has at present power under paragraph (2) ofDefence Regulation 39b, if he is satisfied that it is necessary to prevent or restrict* During the last war the Minister responsible for the Administration of the Press Bureauwas the Home Secretary, but in giving decisions on material submitted the Directors wereguided by the advice of the several departments concerned.t At the time when this Regulation was made a general responsibility was invested in1 theHome Secretary for the Press Bureau, and by &quot;the Secretary of State &quot; was meant the HomeSecretary. If, however, it were now decided to bring this paragraph into operation, furtherconsideration would have to be given to the question of who is the appropriate Minister toexercise powers of censorship dealing wholly with questions of foreign affairs.[23139]
the publication of matters prejudicial to the relations between the UnitedKingdom and any other country to bring that paragraph into operation and&apos;thereafter to give such directions as appear to him necessary or expedient for;)prohibiting the publication of such matters except under authority. ^The bringing of this paragraph into operation would introduce a system oh!compulsory censorship as distinct from the principle at present in operation of voluntary censorship, subject to the risk that the publication of uncensoredmaterial may lead to a prosecution under the Defence Regulation which prohibitsthe publication of matter which may be of assistance to the enemy.The field covered by this new system of compulsory censorship would be-determined by the &apos;&apos; directions &apos;&apos; issued in the Regulation. No doubt at the outsetsuch directions would be closely restricted to matters which present special and urgent dangers from press indiscretions, but there would be an inevitable tendency to widen the scope of such directions. There would, for example, be demands from foreign Powers either for fuller protection or for equality of protection withStates already covered by directions. It would be very difficult to resist these demands, and what began as a limited censorship would before long cover a wide field.The giving of such directions would involve many difficulties. The directionsmight have to be varied or added to from day to day or week to week. Sometimesnew directions contradicting previous directions might be necessary as the inter-national or military situation changes, with consequent changes in the attitudeof the British Government to problems of foreign affairs.4. The existing censorship has to apply security considerations to factualmaterial. The new censorship would be concerned largely with expressions ofopinion, with the effect of the tone and character of press comments, and with theimpression produced by the selection for publication of certain items of news andthe prominence given to them. Such censorship could not be done by the existing staff of the Ministry of Information. The work would involve a very wide and up-to-date knowledge of the international situation and of the attitude of theGovernment, and it seems questionable whether many of the questions could fairly be left to the decision of Civil Servants.5. Would censorship of press matter relating to foreign affairs be attended by such difficulties and disadvantages as to outweigh any benefits&apos;? The indis-cretions of a controlled press are much more embarrassing than those of a freepress. A Goveriunent which has any control over the material published can bealleged by foreign Powers to be responsible for everything which appears in thepress, and however wise and vigilant the censors may be, some of the materialpassed will, nevertheless, offend some foreign susceptibilities. When the resultantcomplaint is made the Foreign Office will no longer have the answer that the pressis free. The difficulty is illustrated by the frequent protests from foreign Govern-ments as to B.B.C. announcements and appeals from His Majesty&apos;s Ministersabroad asking that the B.B.C. should be admonished or restrained. The influenceabroad of a controlled press is far less than that of a press renowned for its freedom.These and other objections would be vehemently voiced. On the issue ofprinciple the few offending papers would be championed by all the other papers.The whole press would be united against the proposal, and there would be muchopposition to the proposal in Parliament.6. Would there be less objection to a provision aimed not at the press ingeneral, but at those papers only which have persistently offended ? Should powerbe taken to suppress a paper which systematically publishes matter prejudicial to our foreign relations, or, alternatively, to require such a paper to submit forcensorship all matter relating to foreign affairs ?Under such provisions the decision as to what is matter prejudicial would rest with the Government, and any provision giving the Government power to suppress views on foreign policy with which the Government&quot; does not agree wouldexcite much opposition. There has been criticism of Regulation 2d, whichempowers the Home Secretary to suppress a newspaper if he is satisfied that it-has systematically published matter calculated to foment opposition to the prose-cution to a successful issue of the war. There would be much stronger oppositionto a Regulation empowering the Government to suppress or &apos;&apos; gag &apos;&apos; a newspaper
--however patriotic it might be or however fervently it might support the wareffoVt if the views of the paper on foreign policy are different from those of the ,Government. The censorship of such a newspaper would also present peculiar&apos;difficulties. The aim of the newspaper in such circumstances would no doubt beto circumvent the Government and to publish under the aigis of government authority matter which would be embarrassing.Another possible course would be to have a provision similar to Regulation 2c.rendering a paper on which a warning notice has been served liable to prosecution,if thereafter it publishes matter prejudicial to our foreign relations. If, under,such a provision, it were left to a jury to decide whether the matter publishedafter such warning is or is not prejudicial to our foreign relations, there wouldprobably be less opposition to such a provision. Would, however, the fear ofprosecution check a newspaper which is purposely campaigning against someforeign policy of the Government ? Would not such a paper welcome the chanceof advocating its views in a court of law ?In order to convince the jury that the matter in question was prejudicial toour foreign relations, it might be necessary to reveal to them confidential informa-tion. Even if the case were heard in camera, such information would have tobe disclosed to the jury and to defendants who, ex hypothesi, might misuse it.7. In October 1940, when the Daily Mirror and Sunday Pictorial hadpublished objectionable articles, the Cabinet decided that the Lord Privy Sealand the then Minister of Aircraft Production (Lord Beaverbrook) should put theview of the Government before the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; Association. As aresult, the tone of these newspapers showed for some time a marked improvement.If this procedure were repeated, there is a risk that the recalcitrant papersmight refuse to respond and might attempt to exploit the situation byrepresenting that the Government had tried to exercise illegitimate pressure on thepress and to &apos;&apos; gag &apos;&apos; their critics.8. Another possible course would be for a Government spokesman (and we doubt whether anyone less than the Prime Minister would be effective) to makea statement in Parliament pointing out that, a specified newspaper was not acting in the national interest, calling attention to the mischievous effect on foreign relations and commenting on any other misdemeanours of^the paper in question,such as irresponsible and ill-informed excursions into the field of strategy andunfounded or exaggerated criticisms of the administration made for the purposeof attracting readers by sensational statements. Such a statement would in a proper case be very damaging to a newspaper so stigmatised; it would not belikely to provoke united opposition from other papers and could not be represented as an attempt to silence expressions of opinions inconvenient to the Government.9. During the war numerous articles have appeared in the press which atthe time seemed likely to impair the war effort either by injuring foreign relationsor by shaking confidence in the national Government or disrupting the national unity, but in retrospect it is seen that the effect of such, articles has beencomparatively insignificant.While we fully realise that the freedom allowed to the press presents specialdangers in time of war and that a vigilant watch must be kept lest such freedomshould endanger the successful prosecution of the war, we do not feel able torecommend in present circumstances at any rate the introduction of new methods of coercion, but we think the possibility of taking such action as isoutlined in paragraph 8 above should be kept in mind.A.
