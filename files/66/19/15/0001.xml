naval SITUATION.General Review.1. Naval aircraft have carried out an attack on enemy shipping and com-munications in Northern Norway.Supplies for Russia have arrived at Archangel.Shipping losses have been light.North Atlantic.2. H.M. Trawler Loch Oskaig (Armed Boarding Vessel) was damaged byFocke-Wulf attack off the Portuguese coast on the 13th.IT.M. Corvette Fleur de Lys on patrol in the Western Approaches to theStraits of Gibraltar was torpedoed and sunk by U-boat on the 14th. Threesurvivors were picked up by a Spanish vessel.During the week seven French merchant vessels (35,000 tons) have passed gibraltar westbound.Northern Waters.3. On the 8th October naval aircraft from H.M.S. Victorious made a dawnattack on shipping in the Vestf jord area; they set on fire a 1,000-ton ship and hitelectric pylons on Grond Island. A second attack was made about noon on shipping&quot; in the Bodo area and two 2,000-ton vessels and one of 700 tons were hit.  All our aircraft returned safely. .....H.M. Destroyer Norman, with members of the T.U.C., arrived at Archangelon the 12th.The first convoy, with supplies for Russia, arrived at Archangel on the11th and a convoy from Archangel, including Russian ships, has arrived in theUnited Kingdom.Mediterranean.4. Main units of the Mediterranean Fleet operated off Mersa Matruh onthe night 11th/12th, and, after cruising to the westward, returned withoutencountering any enemy ships. Italian torpedo bombers made an unsuccessfulattack on the Fleet on the 13th.In the supplying Tobruk by sea, one lighter was damaged by a U-boat on the10th and two others, which have not been heard of since unloading at Tobruk onthe 11th, are presumed to have been sunk.H.M. Submarine Talisman torpedoed a 4,000-ton ship aground on SanGiorgio Island (Milo) on the 3rd, and a ship in convoy entering East Channelon the 4th (probably French s.s. Theophile Gautier, vide paragraph 18 ofResume 110). Talisman also torpedoed and sank a 3,000-ton merchant ship in convoy off Suda Bay on the 7th.Anti-Sufomarine Operations.5. A promising attack was made by aircraft on a U-boat 100 miles southof Iceland (C). Three other attacks were made by aircraft, two to north-westwardof Cape Finisterre and one to westward of Ushant, without conclusive results.A U-boat which had attacked a convoy north-west of Dakar was driven off byH.M. Sloop Londonderry. H.M. Destroyer Croome attacked a U-boat offGibraltar, and a U-boat, which was in action with three lighters on passage toTobruk from Mersa Matruh, was hit several times before submerging.Enemy Intelligence.German.6. There has been no significant change in the positions of the enemy mainunits during the past week. There are indications of one raider operating&apos; in theSouth Atlantic, and possibly another in the Indian Ocean.
U-Boats.7. About 27 U-boats have been operating during the week. One group hasbeen in an area east to south-east of Cape Farewell (south Greenland), andanother group on the north Atlantic convoy route in mid-Atlantic. To westwardof Portugal an outward-bound convoy to Gibraltar was chased for several dayswithout success by about six U-Boats, which have since remained off Cape St.Vincent. About seven others have been in the Canaries to Freetown area. It ispossible that in the early part of the week four or five XT-Boats operated eastwardof the Straits of Gibraltar.Of the 25 Italian U-Boats which were working from French ports in August,one has been sunk and ten have been withdrawn to the Mediterranean It isthought that the improvements being carried out at La Pallice may indicate thatthe fourteen Italians are to be based there, so as to leave Bordeaux free for german use.Enemy Attack on Seaborne Trade.8. During the week 5 ships have been sunk by U-Boat off the Atlanticseaboard and one in the Western Approaches, of which three were in outboundconvoys and one was sailing independently. One ship was mined and sunk offthe Humber. Two East Coast convoys were attacked by E-Boats during the night 12th/13th and two ships were sunk; the E-Boats were driven off by destroyers and one may have been sunk and others damaged. Enemy aircraftsank one ship off Lowestoft, damaged a ship in the Suez Canal area and sank a trawler off the Faroes. One aircraft .was shot down in an attack on an east coast convoy on 10th. A Channel convoy was fired at by coastal, batteries on 9th without sustaining any damage. A Norwegian ship was sunk by, presumably,a raider in the South Pacific.The shipping losses in September (details of which are given in Appendix I)were 72 ships and 4 small craft, totalling 266,614 tons, of which 53 ships and3 small craft (197,168 tons) were British. This total is about the average for thewar, but is a large increase over the exceptionally low figures for the last twomonths. Fifty-three ships were sunk by U-Boat, principally in the Greenland-Iceland area and in mid-Atlantic in the latitude of Ushant. Five ships, a ferry-steamer and a trawler were mined, two in the Thames Estuary, and three sunk by E-Boat off the Norfolk coast. Ten ships and a fishing vessel were sunk by aircraft. In addition, 11 ships and 15 small craft, totalling 59,528 tons, whichare included in Appendix I, were reported in August but lost in previous months.Protection of Seaborne Trade.9. During the week ending the 15th October 898 ships, including 194 allied and 39 neutrals, were convoyed. One cruiser, 4 armed merchant cruisers, 6 anti-aircraft ships, 93 destroyers&apos;(including 20 United States destroyers) and 96 sloops,corvettes and fleet mine-sweepers were employed on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the11th October totalled 951,016 tons compared with 784,584 tons during the previous seven days and an average of 939,473 tons for the past ten weeks. There werein addition about 6,000 tons of special Government cargo. Oil imports were178,916 tons. Mineral imports were 290,257 tons, of which 170,995 tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron, and iron ore. Imports of wood andwood pulp were 61,137 tons, of copra and palm oil 3,869 tons, and ofcereals 184,248 tons, of which 5,679 tons were rice. Twenty-four ships were fully laden with grain and flour. Other food imports totalled 144,320 tons,the principal commodities being, in tons: sugar and molasses 65,771,refrigerated and tinned meat, bacon and ham 16,536, fruit 9,263 (including,277 tons of oranges), lard and cooking fats 7,358, evaporated milk 7,279, cheese5,913, and tea 3,047. There were also 3,287 tons of unspecified tinned food. Rumimports were 1,200 tons from Trinidad and 100 tons from Demerara, and tobaccoimports 5,746 tons. Imports of motor lorries, machinery, high explosives, cotton and hemp were also satisfactory.[23021] b
British Minelaying.10.   There has been some minelaying by aircraft in the Baltic, the North sea and the Bay of Biscay.Enemy Minelaying and British Minesweeping.Home Waters.11. Minelaying by enemy aircraft was suspected in the Thames Estuary onthe nights 11th/12th October and 14th/15th.Sixteen magnetic mines and 24 acoustic have been detonated during the week,24 of them in the Humber area and in the Bristol Channel. ^Foreign Waters.12. Eleven enemy aircraft raided Tobruk early on the 11th October. Twomines without parachutes were dropped outside the harbour and one may be inthe searched channel.Enemy Merchant Shipping.13. The German Atlas (2,297 tons) left Barcelona on the 6th October forGenoa, and the Elisabeth Hendrik Fisser (5,145 tons) left Valencia on the10th October for Genoa. Two German ships, the Trapani (1,855 tons) and theSalzburg (1,756 tons) are reported to have arrived in the Piraeus on the 8th Octoberwith German and Austrian troops and vehicles on board. They were convoyedby two Italian warships. The German Mosel (8,428 tons) was reported on the9th October to have arrived recently at Yokohama. The German Natal(3,172 tons) which sailed from Santos, Brazil, on the 27th June, is now said tohave arrived at Bordeaux on the 18th August. The German tanker Germania(9,851 tons), which is at Teneriffe, was rumoured to be leaving on the 14th or the15th October.  She is in ballast with 400 tons of bunker fuel.The German Hohenfels (7,862 tons) left Bandar Shahpur (P.G.) for Karachion the 11th October in tow of two tugs. The Italian Hilda (4,901 tons) arrived atBombay on the 13th October in tow of the German Sturmfels (6,288). these three ships were captured at Bandar Shahpur (P.G.).French Merchant Shipping.14. Sixty-three of the 90 Allied, Neutral and Danish ships detained inVichy controlled ports seem to have been taken over by the Vichy authorities.Twenty-one of these ships, totalling some 96,000 tons, are&quot; reported to be under the direct control of the Axis though sailing under the French flag. Forty-two of the90 ships are now believed to be in the Mediterranean and 17 of them were broughtthrough the Straits of Gibraltar under the French flag.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is included in theResume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Finland.15. There has been no change on the Finnish front beyond a slight advanceof the Finnish forces to a line running approximately from Shakshinsk to thepoint where the Petrozavodsk-Leningrad railway crosses the River Svir.Leningrad.16. No material change has taken place. The Germans now occupy a semi-circle around Leningrad about twelve miles from the city.Central Sector.17. It is in this sector that the Germans are now making their greatesteffort, consisting of three main thrusts : (a) North of the road Smolensk-Moscow;(b) from Roslayl towards Vyasma, thereafter towards Moscow;(c) Glukhov-Orel-Tula (a large armament centre).
18. These attacks have already achieved very considerable success. Thenorthern and central thrusts have effected a junction north-east of Vyasma, thusencircling large Russian forces to the west of that town. A further advance onMoscow has already begun and has reached a point just south-east of Mohaisk.which is 65 miles from Moscow on the Vyasma-Moscow railway. The southernattack has passed beyond Orel, leaving behind large pockets of Russians northand south of Bryansk.19. These pincer moves must have by-passed large forces of Timoshenko&apos;s army, but so far there is no reliable indication of the number of Russians who may be trapped.Ukraine and Crimea,,20. There has been no very intensive drive on Kharkov, but to the west and north-west of the town the Germans have gained a considerable area of ground.A drive south-eastwards from the Glukhov-Orel sector to turn the defences inthat area is still a possibility.21. The main feature in the south has been the continuance of the thrustof armoured forces southwards from the Dnepropetrovsk area to the Sea of Azovat Berdyansk, the capture of which created another large pocket of Russians tothe west. This pocket has been mopped up. From Berdyansk a rapid advance was made eastwards along the coast; armoured elements having taken Mariupolhave now reached the area of Taganrog, some 45 miles from Rostov.22. Pressure is being maintained at the approaches to the Crimea, and afurther attack is to be expected in the near future.Conchisions.23. The Germans appear at present to have two objects in view in theiroffensive on the Russian front : (a) To envelop and annihilate a large part of the Russian forces west andsouth-west of Moscow, thereby clearing the way for a rapid advance on the capital;   and(&amp;) In the extreme south to press forward to the River Don and then penetratedeep into the Caucasus before the winter sets in.24. There are still indications of preparations in the Bulgarian Black Seaports for a combined operation against the Crimea and/or the north-easternshores of the Black Sea.Operations.Egypt and Libya.25. At Tobruk the feature of the week has been the extent to which theenemy have utilised their tanks on observation and patrol work. To counter this we have ourselves employed tanks in support of our infantry. On the night ofthe llth/12th a prolonged and spirited action, with opposing tanks at timeswithin 50 yards of each other, forced the enemy to withdraw from an observationpost which they had occupied the previous night. Owing to poor visibility itwas not possible to observe enemy casualties and damage. Our own casualties in these encounters, both in personnel and tanks, have been very light.26. In face of increased enemy aggressiveness our ground patrols have consistently and vigorously maintained the offensive, and with only slight loss to themselves have inflicted considerable casualties on the enemy.27. In the frontier area our patrolling has been active and our artilleryhas carried out several successful shoots; on the 13th October patrols reported alarge explosion and several fires in the area north of Qaret Abu Fayres.[23021] b 2
28. Although successful action by our submarines and aircraft has hamperedmovement across the Mediterranean, German and Italian reinforcements have continued to arrive in Libya during the past week. The Axis strength in Libyais still not such as would permit of a large-scale offensive, but an attack on Tobrukremains a distinct possibility.A abyssinia.29.   Operations round Gondar have been confined to patrolling activity.Iraq.30.   Further reinforcements have arrived from India during the past week.Intelligence.Far East.31. Although both the Japanese and the Chinese during the past week haveclaimed large successes in the recent operations in China, no operations of strategic importance have been in progress, and the Chinese claims of successesagainst Ichang have not been substantiated.32. The Japanese troops who moved against Changsha have withdrawn totheir original positions in the Yochow area, and the few Chinese that penetratedIchang were soon captured; other Chinese who attempted to attack the city area were repulsed with heavy losses.33. The failure of the Chinese to capture Ichang, even whilst the Japanesegarrison was seriously weakened by their raid on Changsha, shows their inability to initiate any major operations against the Japanese. They are unlikely to beable to do so until they are able to count upon considerably more artillery and air support than is likely to be available to them for some time to come.Greece.34. Reports have been received during the past two months of the construc-tion of defence works by the Germans in the Olympus area, and Greeks are saidto have been forcibly employed on the work. These defences form part of a line which embraces the old Metaxas line in Thrace and Macedonia and which is continued across Mount Olympus and Mount Vermion through Epirus to theIonian Sea.AIR SITUATION.General.35. Bomber Command operations have been on a heavier scale, both by day and night, and the sorties despatched on the night of the 12th/13th Octobertotalled 373, a new high level. Many successful attacks were made against shipping in the North Sea.German Air Force activity on the Western Front was again at ,a low level.In the Mediterranean numerous attacks were made on enemy shipping, andin Libya many successful operations were carried out against enemy supplies,communications and aerodromes.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.36. Bomber Command flew 95 sorties, compared with 12 last week, and dropped 33 tons of H.E. bombs and 88 incendiaries. Fighter Command flew758 sorties in the course of offensive operations over occupied territory and against shipping. Attacks on shipping are reported under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;
37. On the 12th a heavy attack was made by 24 Blenheims on Boulogne^ 6 $docks and most of their bombs fell in the target area, which was left completelyobscured by smoke. On the following day the chemical works and power station at Mazingarbe, near Bethune, were attacked by 18 Blenheims, and bursts were seen on two cooling towers and among the condenser plant. During an attack ondocks at Havre by 12 aircraft, a ship of 10,000 tons alongside was hit amidshipsand blew up. Two Blenheims were shot.down during this attack, one by A.A.and the other by fighters. The ship lift at Arques, near St. Omer, was attacked by six aircraft, but owing to strong fighter opposition the result could not be observed.38. A total of 52 fighter squadron sorties were flown as escort and cover for all these operations, and 33 enemy fighters were destroyed, 7 probably destroyed and 21 damaged, against our loss of 2 bombers and 16 fighters. Othercasualties to our bombers are reported under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;39. On most days of the week Hurricanes, Spitfires and Airacobras were despatched to France and Belgium and attacked a variety of targets, includingaerodromes, motor transport and trains. Near Havre a locomotive was seen toexplode and goods trucks were left on fire, and at Calais an Me. 109 was destroyedwhile taking off.  Two enemy float planes were destroyed, and a third damaged.Night.40. After seven nights of inactivity, improved weather conditions on the night of the 10th/11th enabled Bomber Command to resume large-scale opera-tions. On that night 238 sorties were flown, and two nights later 373, the highestnumber yet recorded. A total of 902 sorties were flown, compared with 109 lastweek, and 933 tons of H.E. bombs and 65,500 LBs. were dropped, compared with163 tons and 14,600 incendiaries last week.41. The heaviest attack of the week was made on Nuremberg, on which bombs were dropped for the first time. Eighty aircraft attacked in excellent weather conditions, dropping 92 tons of H.E. bombs and 16,000 LBs., including 150 of50 lbs. The town and forest round it were left burning well, and large fires were seen in and near the Siemens-Schuckert works. A renewed attack by a smallerforce two nights later was hindered by heavy clouds and severe icing. Colognewas attacked on three nights, and 165 tons of H.E. bombs, including eight of4,000 lbs., and 9,800 LBs. were dropped, but visibility was poor owing to cloud,haze and searchlight glare, and bursts could not be accurately pin-pointed, thoughone 4,000-lb. bomb was seen to burst near the station. Other objectives bonibedduring the week include Bremen (78 tons), Essen (59 tons), dusseldorf (55 tons),Emden (29 tons), a chemical works at Huls (33 tons) and the dock areas ofRotterdam and Bordeaux,, but weather conditions were consistently poor, and apart from fires no detailed results were seen. Better weather was encounteredat Dunkirk, Ostend and Boulogne, and bursts and fires were seen in the dockareas.42. On two nights successful attacks were made on the searchlight beltscovering the Ruhr. Among the alternative targets attacked during the week wereaerodromes, industrial areas in the Ruhr, and a ship at Den Helder, which was hit by two bombs.43. Coastal aircraft attacked aerodromes at Valkenburg (Holland), Listerand Esbjerg. At the latter a stick of bombs fell across the runways and buildings;other bombs burst among shipping in the docks and on buildings on the quayside,and the power station was possibly hit. A fish oil factory on the norwegian coast was hit and set on fire.On three nights of the week Havocs operated over enemy aerodromes and caused several fires; one large aircraft at Gilze-Rijen was destroyed, but inmost instances no positive results were observed.United Kingdom.44. Fighter Command flew a total of 2,214 sorties by day and 588 sortiesby night; these figures represent a very big increase over the sorties flown duringthe previous week.
German Air Force activity has continued at approximately the same low level as that of last week.  Only four aircraft crossed the coast by day.45. By night, a total of 210 enemy aircraft operated against this country,55 of these being night fighters. The heaviest attack was made on the night ofthe 12th/13th, when 50 long-range bombers were engaged; Manchester seems tohave been the main target, but bombs were dropped over a wide area, mainly inLancashire and Cheshire. Enemy fighters operated on five nights during theweek; on the night of the 12th/13th, when our bombers were operating in largenumbers, 20 enemy fighters were engaged over this country.Five enemy aircraft were destroyed, three by night fighters. \Minelaying operations were suspected on some nights during the week.There is evidence that bomb-mines of 1,000 kg. are being used.Coastal Operations.46. Coastal Command flew 256 patrols (430 sorties) and provided 37 convoy escorts (110 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols flown by fighter command totalled 528 (1,084 sorties).47. Many successful attacks were made on enemy shipping during the week.Shipping off the Dutch coast was attacked on three days by a force of Coastaland Bomber Command Blenheims with fighter escort, and Blenheims, Hudsonsand Beauforts of Coastal Command made many individual attacks both by day and night on shipping off the Norwegian, Danish and Dutch coasts. Owing to heavy flak opposition the results of many of these attacks, often made from mastheight, were unobserved.   Ships known to have been damaged are as follows : Date.	Type.	Tonnage.	Locality.

Our fighters attacked shipping in French and Belgian harbours, and setfire to two merchant ships of 1,500 and 500 tons, and severely damaged another of 800 tons, a trawler and a flak ship. Small craft in harbour and canals atDunkirk and Gravelines were also attacked.49. A low-level daylight attack was made by three Hudsons on EsbjergDocks, and many bursts followed by columns of smoke were seen on the docks and quayside.50. Enemy aircraft made five shipping attacks during the week. By days ship in harbour in the Faroes was sunk, and a convoy off Skegness and a ship off S. Portugal were unsuccessfully attacked. Two convoys were attacked by night, one off St. David&apos;s Head, the other off the East Coast. One ship in thelatter was sunk. Aircraft of K.G. 40, the long-range unit, operated every dayover the Atlantic, the area of operations being further south each day.Central Mediterranean.51. Our reconnaissance aircraft located a number of enemy ships and numerous offensive sorties were carried out.   A south-bound conww of three
merchant vessels, two of 6,000 and one of 8,000 tons, and one tanker, escorted byfive destroyers and four aircraft, was located 46 miles E.N.E. of Kuriate Island.Two waves, each consisting of seven Swordfish, attacked this convoy, a furtherattack being made by six Wellingtons. As a result of these attacks, two merchantvessels are considered to have been sunk and one, and possibly two, damaged.A merchant vessel of about 4,000 tons and a cargo boat of some 1,200 tons were attacked by 6 Blenheims 58 miles W.N.W. of Sirte and both ships were probably sunk. Seven Swordfish obtained two hits on a 6,000-ton merchant vessel 75 miles south of Lampedusa; a destroyer was seen to be picking up survivors. other attacks were made on shipping, but results could not be observed.52. On two successive nights Tripoli (L) was attacked and a total of about22 tons of bombs was dropped. Three large ships in the centre of the harbourwere heavily attacked, but results could not be observed. Hits or near-misses were obtained on the Spanish Mole and quay, the seaplane base, barracks east effort Hamidie, the Spanish Fort and the Arab quarter.53. A convoy of 14 lorries was attacked by four Blenheims 15 miles east ofthe Gulf of Sidra. Three large covered lorries were destroyed and others damaged; one bomb burst in a cluster of drivers and passengers; the convoy and troops were also heavily machine-gunned.54. An increase has been noticeable in air transport activity between sicily and Tripoli during the past week. It is possible that these Italian transport aircraft may be, in part, carrying specialised personnel whose presence in Libyais urgently required, and whose arrival may have been held up owing to the dangers of the sea crossing.55. Four Hurricanes carrying bombs attacked the aerodrome at Comiso,Sicily, but results were unobserved. A Fulmar bombed the aerodrome at CastelVetrano causing a large explosion.56. At Malta enemy aircraft crossed the coast on only a few occasions; on one night nine fighters machine-gunned Luqa doing only slight damage; oneMacchi was destroyed by Hurricanes, A.A- probably destroyed another and damaged five. One Hurricane is missing. On another night four bombersdropped bombs but caused no damage.Eastern Mediterranean.57. Heavy attacks were again made at night by Wellingtons on the harbour at Benghazi; a large fire was started at a nearby coal store and other fires were seen between the wireless station and the workshops. Six mary lands carriedout a successful daylight attack, hits being observed near railway sidings andthe Juliana Mole. On three nights Bardia was attacked by a total of twenty-fourBlenheims. A number of bombs were seen to drop on or near the M.T. workshopswhich were the principal target, other bursts were seen in the town and the harbour area.58. A night attack was made on Derna by 17 Wellingtons. Numerousfires were started near store dumps and the power station was hit and set on fire. Seven tons of bombs were dropped in a daylight attack amongst dispersedaircraft on the landing ground, which was again attacked the same night. the landing grounds at Benina, Berca, Gazala and Gambut were successfully attacked; numerous fires and some violent explosions were caused. NineMarylands attacked fifty tanks and two hundred M.T. vehicles about twenty miles east of Tobruk: over eight tons of bombs were released and were seen to fall among the vehicles. An attack was made by five Wellingtonson oil containers in Piraeus Harbour.59. Our fighters flew many shipping protection patrols and escorted our aircraft engaged in photographic and tactical reconnaissances. Forty-five ofour fighters, while providing covering patrols for our ground forces nearBir Sherferzen, had several engagements with 30 Me. 109s and ten G. 50s; threeHe. 109s and one G. 50 were destroyed, two Mes. probably destroyed and fourothers damaged; four of our Tomahawks were shot down.
60. Enemy bombing attacks have again been mainly directed against Tobrukand against landing grounds and aerodromes in Egypt; Mersa Matruh was alsotwice raided. Very little damage was done except at Fuka landing ground wherea petrol dump, fuel train and service ammunition train were destroyed and the aerodrome rendered temporarily unserviceable. A camp and armoured cars were bombed and machine-gunned in the frontier area and a few casualties were caused.One enemy aircraft dropped bombs on Haifa causing negligible damage and no casualties.Russia.61. Owing to adverse weather conditions no British air operations were carried out.  There is no information of Russian air operations.62. German long-range bombers, operating both by day and night, and divebombers have directed their attacks mainly against important centres of road and rail communications, thus hampering not only the bringing up of supplies andreinforcements, but also the retirement of the Russian armies.Large bodies of Russian troops have been left either encircled in the rear of the armoured formations or on the flanks of the main thrusts, and it is against these that the German lighter forces have been mainly employed, apart fromtheir normal escort and aerodrome patrol duties. Bad weather has to some extentlimited air operations generally.It is considered that both enemy air force and army units in the forwardareas have been dependent to a large extent on transport aircraft for supplies of fuel and ammunition in view of the bad roads and congestion which must existfor surface transport.On the other sectors of the front, air operations have been unimportant, andthe advance to the Sea of Azov, carried out at great speed, appears to have called for little air support.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.63. There was no bombing during daylight. On one night of the week nobombs were dropped, and on four nights bombing was limited to a few incidents,mainly in the North-East of England and East Anglia. On the two other nights(the 11th/12th and 12th/13th) there was some increase in the number of bombingincidents, but no concentrated attack was made.Damage.64. Apart from slight interference with railway and utility services,damage has been confined to private property. The most serious incidentsoccurred on the night of the 12th/13th, when several houses were demolished inManchester, Clayton, Denton and Oldham.Casualties.65. Casualties for the week ending 0600 the 15th October are estimated at61 killed and 69 seriously injured. Twenty-three of the fatal casualties occurred at Oldham on the night of the 12th/13th.
