NAVAL SITUATION.General Review.1.   Successful operations have been carried out in the Mediterranean.U-Boat attacks in the Atlantic have resulted in our shipping losses beincheavier than of late. 0Northern Waters.2. On the 11th October H.M. Submarine Tigris, on patrol off North Cape,attacked three eastbound merchant ships and claimed three possible hits. Onthe following day she torpedoed a westbound ship in an escorted convoy.The Russian Submarine D. 3, on return from patrol off Tana Fjord, claimedhits on four merchant ships between the 26th September and 11th October, andanother Russian Submarine torpedoed and sank a 3,000-ton ship at Havninberg,east of the North Cape.Home Waters and North Atlantic.3. The 14th Canadian troop convoy arrived in the United Kingdom onthe 17th.Recent heavy weather in the Atlantic has resulted in damage to severaldestroyers and caused damage to auxiliary and harbour vessels at Aultbea (westScotland).While escorting a homeward-bound convoy from Canada, the U.S. DestroyerKeurny and H.M. Destroyer Broadwater (ex U.S. Town class) were torpedoedby U-Boats, 600 and 380 miles to the westward of the Hebrides respectively. Theformer reached Iceland (C) under her own steam, but the latter subsequentlysank, her casualties being two officers killed and two missing.On the 21st H.M. Armed Merchant Cruiser Aurania, on passage home fromHalifax, was torpedoed 350 miles S.W. of Ireland but reached the Clyde safelyon the 23rd.Mediterranean.4. H.M. Cruisers Aurora and Penelope have arrived at Malta from home waters.An operation to reinforce Malta with aircraft has been successfully completed.Thirteen aircraft were flown off from an aircraft carrier, twelve of which arrivedsafely.On the 14th H.M. Submarine Unique torpedoed and probably sank the ItalianArmed Merchant Cruiser Citta di Genova (5,413 tons) to the southward of Naples,and on the 18th HM. Submarine Ursula attacked a convoy to the westward ofLampedusa and probably sank two ships.On the 17th s.s. Clan macdonald, on passage to Gibraltar from Malta, was attacked by Italian torpedo-bombers to the southward of Sardinia, but successfulavoiding action was taken and a second attack was driven off by gunfire.In the Eastern Mediterranean all light forces are being employed in bombard-ments, mining operations, the supply of Tobruk and anti-submarine sweeps. Onthe Libyan coast bombardments have been carried out by H.M. Submarine Torbayand H.M. Gunboat Gnat. The latter was torpedoed while returning and had herbows blown away, but reached Alexandria in tow of a destroyer.During the week 25,000 tons of French shipping, under escort, have passed the Straits of Gibraltar westbound, and 42,000 tons eastbound.South Atlantic.5. R.F.A. Darkdale, a tanker of 8,145 tons, was sunk in St. Helena harbourduring the night of the 22nd/23rd by U-Boat attack.Anti-Submarine Operations.6. During the week there have been fifteen attacks on U-boats, the majorityof which took place in the North Atlantic and to the westward of Ireland. Twopromising attacks were carried out by the escorts of the homeward-bound convoy
from Canada, which was repeatedly attacked by U-boats in mid-Atlantic. Eightattacks were carried out by aircraft, but although hits and near misses were claimed in five of these, in no instance was there any definite evidence of destruction.Enemy Intelligence.7.   There has been no important change in the positions of the enemy main&apos;  units.   On the 19th October H.M. Minesweeper Harrier carried out a reconnais-sance at Longyerby (Spitzbergen), where she found that Germans had landedfrom an aircraft with the intention of establishing a W/T station.  The Germansescaped, but some of their equipment fell into our hands.U-boats.8. About thirty U-boats have beeu operating during the week. There havebeen three main groups, in an area south-east of Greenland, off the west ofIreland and in the Gibraltar area. A number of U-boats have been reported inthe Cape Verde area and off Freetown and one off St. Helena. One or two U-boatshave been reported in the approaches to the White Sea.Enemy Attack on Seaborne: Trade.9. Shipping losses, primarily due to U-boats, have been considerably heavierthan of late. In the early part of the week U-boats in mid-Atlantic made repeatedattacks on a homeward-bound convoy from Canada, resulting in the loss of eightships. A homeward-bound convoy from Sierra Leone was attacked later in theweek, and up to the present one ship is known to have been sunk and another is missing. Three ships, independently routed, were sunk by U-boat, two to the westward of Gibraltar and one off Freetown. In the eastern Mediterranean asmall tanker and a Greek ship, with petrol and stores for Tobruk, were torpedoed and sunk to the west of Alexandria. A Russian ship was torpedoed in the approaches to the White Sea. Two laden colliers were mined and sunk in the thames Approaches, and one small ship was bombed and sunk iu the St. George&apos;s channel.Protection of Seaborne Trade.10. During the week ending the 22nd October 966 ships, including 196) allied and 26 neutral, were convoyed. Two cruisers, six armed merchant cruisers, sevenanti-aircraft ships, 96 destroyers (including twenty American) and 108 sloops,corvettes and fleet minesweepers were employed, on escort duties.Imports into Great Britain by ships in convoy during the week ending the18th October totalled 789,286 tons, and there were also about 8,000 tons of specialGovernment cargo. During the previous seven days imports were 939,473 tons,and the average for the past ten weeks was 943,273 tons. Oil imports were 332,382tons in 31 tankers. Mineral imports were 205,570 tons, of which 128,491tons were steel, scrap iron, pig iron and iron ore. Imports of wood and pulpwere 4,457 tons, and of copra and palm oil 20,792 tons. Cereal imports wereunusually small, totalling 28,478 tons, two ships being fully laden with grain.Other food imports were very satisfactory, being 130,574 tons, of which theprincipal commodities in tons were : Sugar and molasses 36,736, refrigeratedand tinned meat, bacon and ham 24,041, cocoa 5,990, cheese 4,962, evaporated andtinned milk 4,830, tea 4,660, fruit 4,154 (including 613 tons of oranges), lard and cooking fats 3,992, butter 2,402. There were also 1,656 tons of unspecified tinnedfoods. Four consignments of tobacco totalled 4,243 tons. Imports of rubber,textiles, high explosives and machinery were also satisfactory.British Minelaying,11. During the week mines have been laid in the approaches to Lorient, offthe French north coast and off North Rona.In the Mediterranean mines have been laid off the coast of Sardinia.Minelaying by aircraft has been carried out in the Baltic, North Sea andBiscay ports:[23050] B
Enemy Minelaying, British Minesweeping&quot;.12. Minelaying by enemy aircraft has taken place in the Thames approaches and off the East Coast, and aircraft have been reported operating in LiverpoolBay, off Milford Haven and between Beachy Head and Portsmouth.Ten magnetic and fourteen acoustic mines have been destroyed during theweek. The mine totals to date are: magnetic 1.484; acoustic 1,130; contact1,063.Enemy Merchant Shipping.Northern Waters.13. Reports have been received stating that the Norwegian tanker Borgny(3,015 tons), was sunk after leaving Oslo on the 1st October for Trondheim witha cargo of petrol.On the 19th October Oslo broadcast that the Norwegian S.S. Vesteraalen(682 tons), had been sunk two days previously by a British submarine offOeksf jord.During September four enemy merchant ships of over 1,000 tons passed through the Dover Strait in an easterly direction and four in a westerly direction.The former, totalling some 15,000 tons, were all either sunk or damaged.The Black Sea and the aegean.The Germans have undertaken salvage operations in the Piraeus and haverefloated five Greek ships, one of which is the tanker Petrakis Nomikos(7,020 tons).The Roumanian S.S. Balcic (3,600 tons) and the Bulgarian S.S. Balkan(3,838 tons), sailed from Istanbul on the 16th October, and next morning passed into the aegean bound for Trieste. The German S.S. Cordelia (1,357 tons) was expected on the 14th October at Istanbul, and it is believed that she will beemployed on the Istanbul-Trieste route. This revival of the Trieste-Istanbultraffic is of particular interest considering the new trade agreement between turkey and Germany and the large quantities of vital commodities which Turkeyhas agreed to sell to Germany. The railways between Turkey and Europe arestill cut and sea transport in the Black Sea is limited. Seven are already employedon this work and others are expected.The Italian tanker Tampico (4,958 tons), was due at Istanbul on the17th October from the Black Sea on her way to the ^aegean, and the RoumanianS.S. Alba Julia (5,701 tons), which is reported to be in the Piraeus, was expectedat Istanbul about the 19th October.MILITARY SITUATION.(An outline map showing Axis operations against Russia is includedin the Resume as an inset.)Russo-German Campaign.Finland.14. There has been no substantial change on the Finnish and Leningrad,fronts.Kalinin Sector.15. The Germans, after advancing rapidly north-east from Rzhev andreaching Kalinin on the Leningrad-Moscow railway, met with stubbornresistance. After endeavouring to move in a north-westerly direction in anattempt to encircle the Russian forces in the Lake Seliger area, and meeting with strong opposition, it now appears that they intend to strike north-eastwards. no progress has, however, yet been made, and there is much confused fighting in theKalinin area.
Central Sector.16. After clearing up the Russian pocket west of Vyasma, the Germansadvanced eastwards, but the Russian resistance, bad roads and supply difficulties have made their progress slow, and the line at present runs north and souththrough Mohaisk (some 65 miles west of Moscow).17. Further south the Germans have succeeded in capturing Kaluga andPeremishl.18. In the Mzensk sector, north-east of Orel, the Russians have succeeded in preventing any further German advance.19.   The Russian pockets north and south of Bryansk have been eliminated.Ukraine and Crimea.20. No great progress has been made in the German drive on Karkov, butpressure continues.21. In the extreme south, the thrust to the east beyond Mariupol haswidened out at its base, north of Berdyansk, but has not progressed eastwardbeyond the Taganrog area.   The town of Taganrog has fallen to the Germans.In this sector, too, the weather has created difficult road conditions affectingthe movement of troops and the bringing up of supplies.22.   Pressure is still being maintained at the approaches to the Crimea,although no definite break-through is yet apparent.Odessa has been evacuated by the Russians.Conclusions.23. The slowing up of the German advance, due partly to stout russian resistance and partly to weather and supply difficulties, is encouraging. It is too early as yet to suggest the possibility of stabilisation on the present centralfront, still less so in the south, but the German difficulties in advancing acrossthe River Don and thence into the Caucasus miist not be underrated.Operations.Egypt and Libya.24. Around Tobruk our patrols have been active and aggressive. On the night of the 14th/15th October 14 Italians were captured, and on the following-night at least 20 casualties were inflicted on enemy working parties. Enemyshelling has been continuous, but has caused little damage. Our counter batteryfire appears to have been effective, particularly on the 21st, when a large explosionwas observed in the neighbourhood of an enemy artillery position from whichthe harbour area had been shelled25. In the frontier area a heavy sand storm on the 17th and 18th curtailedoperations on both sides. On the 21st two German patrols attempted to locateour minefields by driving camels towards them. They did not achieve their object.French Somaliland.26.   In the frontier further 400 refugees have crossed the frontierinto our territory, presumably as a result of the Governor of Jibuti&apos;s policy of excluding unwanted mouths from the colony.Persia.27. The British and Russian forces were withdrawn from the outskirts ofTeheran on the 10th October.The internal situation is improving slightly, though a certain amount ofbrigandage continues.Iraq,28.   Further reinforcements have arrived during the past week.[23050] &apos; b 2
Intelligence.Spain and France.29. At present the Germans do not appear to be exerting any pressure onSpain. The number of German divisions in south-west France remains unchanged. There are some indications of troop movements from France to theEastern Front, but it may be assumed that any divisions which have left havebeen replaced by troops resting from Russia or by low category units. the armoured division which was forming in the Saintes area is believed to have moved to the east, and it is reported that there were no armoured formations orunits in south-west France on the 13th October.Balkan States.30. The number of German divisions in the Balkans is still estimated at 14,but it is possible that some additional reinforcements may have been sent to yugoslavia to deal with the guerillas.31. There are no signs that Turkey is to be subject to an attack by Germanythis year, but reports indicate that her turn may well come next spring.Roumania.32. Odessa has been incorporated in the province of Transnistria, of whichit is to be the capital.33. Reports continue to stress the discontent felt in Roumania as a resultof the Russian campaign. Since the issue of the official communique givingRoumanian losses up to the 1st October as 111,000 in killed, wounded and missing,unofficial estimates have ranged between 190,000 and 220,000. These estimates are probably exaggerated, but it is considered that the true figure may well be between 150,000 and 170,000. All summer resorts are reported to be full ofwounded.Libya.34. Small reinforcements to the German forces in Libya arrived during thepast week, but it is still estimated that the strength does not at present exceedtwo armoured divisions and two infantry regiments of a third division whichis not armoured.Ifaq.35. Nuri Pasha, the Iraq Prime Minister, has agreed that the strength ofthe Iraq Levies, a force of Arab, Kurdish and Assyrian companies employed inthe protection of our air bases in Iraq, should be increased to a maximum of5,000 men.According to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, the effective strength of the levy force was limited to 1,250 officers and other ranks. Nuri suggests, moreover,that the balance of the new recruits should be Assyrians, recruited as far aspossible from among the Assyrian settlers on the Khabur River in north-eastSyria.Persia.36. Security on the roads has improved but little and rapid organisationof the Persian Army and Police for internal security is still a great necessity. .Far East.General.37. The chief developments in the Far East during the past week have been largely political. The outcome of the military operations in Russia in the moscow area and the south will probably considerably influence the new JapaneseGovernment&apos;s action.38. That Japan is preparing to take advantage of any weakening of theAllied Forces is substantiated by a reliable report that the Japanese Navy is nowfully mobilised and on a complete war footing.
39. The recent military activity in China has quietened down. these operations were only of local importance and neither side has achieved anystrategical gain.Japan.40. Japanese military activity has increased in the south China and thenorthern Indo-China areas.Reliable reports have been received of increased activity in the Canton area,especially in the East River District, which is north of the Hong Kong frontier,and of reinforcements which it is reported are to arrive shortly in northernIndo-China.41. It is probable that the Japanese wish to make a drive against Waichow,an important smuggling centre in the East River District, or to increase theirhold on Indo-China.42. There are no indications yet to show that the Japanese are increasing their strategical concentration in the south (Hainan, Formosa, Canton, Indo-China areas).   Their main concentration still remains in Manchukuo.Indo-China.43. From the financial agreement in process of negotiation between theJapanese and Vichy Governments, and from the constant demands for facilities which are being made by the Japanese military authorities in Indo-China, itappears most probable that the Japanese forces in Indo-China will be substan-tially increased. This is confirmed by reliable reports that 20,000 Japanese troops will be landed at Tonking in the near future, and that possibly a further 20,000will be landed subsequently either in south or north Indo-China.44. The Japanese now occupy nine aerodromes in south Indo-China and are reported to be improving or enlarging at least six of these.Invasion of the United Kingdom.45. A report of unknown reliability states that in the middle of October10,000 copies of G.S. maps of Ireland were being printed for the use of para-chutists.  There is no evidence to show which part of the country the maps cover.Photographic evidence continues to show that supply and ammunition dumpsare being built up in close proximity to the main railways approaches to the ports of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp. It is reliably reported that beachlandings from barges are still being practised by the Germans, but recent evidence from Holland shows that no armoured landing craft are being concentrated inthat country.AIR SITUATION.General Review.46. Night-bombing operations over Germany and Occupied Territoryhave been hampered bv poor weather conditions.There have been successful attacks against enemy shipping in Home waters and our fighters have had considerable success against transportation targets inFrance.  Enemy air activitv has again been slight.In the Mediterranean &quot;area there have been many attacks against shipping and the Libyan ports, and particularly successful attacks on Naples.Germany and Occupied Territory.Day.47. Bomber Command despatched 49 sorties, compared with 95 last week,and dropped 4 tons of H.E. bombs. Fighter Command flew 567 sorties m thecourse of offensive operations against shipping and over occupied territory.48. Daylight operations, with the exception of some fighter sweeps, duringwhich land targets in France and Holland were attacked, consisted of raids on shipping and are reported under &quot; Coastal Operations.&quot;
49. On the morning of the 21st, 18 squadrons of fighters were engaged inan offensive sweep in the St. Omer area. A number of combats ensued, in which13 enemy fighters were destroyed, three probably destroyed and four damaged.Our losses during this operation were nine aircraft with four pilots rescued.50. Eight Hurricanes patrolling the Flushing area attacked and damagedvessels in the harbour and canal. A petrol store was also set on fire and casualties were inflicted among personnel at a searchlight post and gun position. In thecourse of operations by Spitfires over Northern France, an ammunition train wasderailed, four locomotives were destroyed, two oil tank wagons were set on fire and many casualties caused among horses and troops in a horse-drawn convoy.Night.51. Bomber Command despatched 715 sorties compared with 902 last weekand a total of 756 tons of H.E. bombs and 45,050 incendiaries were dropped.Attacks were directed principally against ports in Western Germany, andindustrial centres in the Rhineland and Ruhr.52. Bremen was attacked on two consecutive nights, during which a totalof 260 tons of H.E. bombs was dropped, including thirteen 4,000-pounders. Over10,000 incendiaries were also released. Intense darkness and ground hazeprecluded accurate observation of results on the first night, although four large and a number of small fires could be seen.. On the following night visibility wasimproved and many bomb-bursts were seen in the target area, including some onthe Deutsche Schiff Werke.53. Attacks on a lighter scale were made during the week against Mannheim,Wilhelmshaven and Emden, and the inland port of Duisburg. In the attack onDuisburg, which took place in cloudy weather conditions, 72 tons of H.E. bombs and 7,400 incendiaries were dropped, and the glow of several fires was seen. the attack on Mannheim was also hampered by extremely adverse weather and aircraft dispatched on the task encountered heavy cloud and severe icing conditions. Asa result a large proportion of the force was unable to locate the objective and apart from one very large fire results were mainly unobserved.54. Wilhelmshaven and Emden were raided by 47 and 36 aircraft respectively and fires were started at both objectives. Minor attacks were alsocarried out on Antwerp, Dunkirk, Ostend, Boulogne, and Havre, where a largewarehouse in the dock area was blown up.55. Small forces bombed Brest on two occasions and, during the second attack, bursts are reported across the estimated position of the dry docks, wherethe battle-cruisers are berthed.United Kingdom.56. Fighter Command flew 1,800 sorties by day and 536 by night, repre-senting a small decrease on the number flown in the previous week.57. Activity by the German Air Force continued on a low level. Only sevenenemy aircraft crossed the coast by day and 116 by night. The only concentratedattacks, although on a small scale, were made on Merseyside and on Dover. Fiveenemy bombers were destroyed by our night fighters.Coastal Operations.58. Coastal Command flew 191 patrols (289 sorties) and provided 52 convoy escorts (165 additional sorties). Shipping protection patrols by fighter command totalled 484 (1,025 sorties).59. Operations against enemy shipping were carried out by aircraft fromthe three Commands whenever weather permitted. Two Spitfires attacked a ship off Havre, leaving her listing. Eight Blenheims, escorted by fighters, sighted a convoy of seven vessels and four Flakships off Ijmuiden. Four of the merchant ships were attacked but with unobserved results, and two others of 3,000 and1,000 tons respectively had smoke, issuing from them when last seen. .
60. A Hudson made a determined attack on a 5,500 ton merchant vessel(one of a convoy of twelve with two escort vessels) off Terschelling and scored apossible hit or very near miss. A Spitfire attacked four ships of 100 to 200 tonseach off Ostend, and many hits were seen. Hurricanes set on fire two armed trawlers off Zeebrugge.61. Three Hudsons on patrol off the North Danish coast attacked a factory at Thisted Bredning and scored hits on sheds. At Thisted. sea-plane base,buildings and a seaplane were set on fire and dispersed aircraft were machine-gunned.62. Seventeen aircraft were despatched to lay sea-mines off Lorient, Brest,St. Nazaire, Kiel and the Frisian Islands.63. Enemy minelaying was suspected on most nights of the week in the thames Estuary and the Humber. Attacks were made on our shipping at duskon the 16th off Skegness and on the 19th off Ireland.VCentral Mediterranean.64. Our aircraft from Malta made several attacks during the week on shipping in the Mediterranean and on land targets in Italy, Sicily and Tripoli.65. Naples was attacked on three nights by a total of 41 Wellingtonswhich dropped more than 55 tons of H.E. bombs and many incendiaries in the target area. Hits were obtained on the Royal Arsenal, the Alfa Romeo auto-mobile works, the railway station and on the torpedo factory, which, it isestimated, was completely destroyed. Extensive fires were also started, one ofwhich covered a wide area. A factory at Cotrone, in Southern Italy, was twiceattacked by a total of 11 Blenheims.66. In Sicily, attacks were made on a munition factory and a power station at Licata, on which three tons of bombs were dropped, and on a factory and railway sidings near Catania. The aerodrome at Trapani and the seaplane base at Syracuse were also successfully attacked. Four Wellingtons, in co-operationwith a naval force, bombed the aerodrome at Elmas, in Sardinia, and scoredmany hits on runways and buildings.67. Twenty-one Wellingtons dropped 25 tons of bombs on Tripoli (L)harbour. Hits were obtained on the Custom House, the seaplane base and on awarehouse, which was destroyed. A ship of 3,000 tons was set on fire. Horns (L)was bombed by six Blenheims, which dropped two tons of bombs on buildings inthe town. Other Blenheims bombed and machine-gunned motor transport on theroad between Sirte and Zuara and an aerodrome between Zuara and Tripoli,where the barracks were hit and an enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground.68. Reconnaissance aircraft made searches for shipping over wide areas.A convoy consisting of four merchant vessels, each of about 6,000 tons, escorted by four destroyers, was sighted off Marittimo Island proceeding south. Swordfishmade successful torpedo attacks on the convoy on two successive nights. Threehits brought the largest vessel to a standstill and set it on fire, and two, possibly three, other vessels were hit.A merchant vessel of 1,500 tons and a schooner of 600 tons were bombedoff Cape Bon by six Blenheims. The schooner blew up and the merchant vessel was set on fire. Another merchant vessel of 2,000 tons was attacked off the coast of Tunis by four Blenheims. A direct hit was scored near the funnel and the vessel is claimed as seriously damaged.69. Several small formations of enemy fighters and bombers operated overMalta during the week. A few casualties were caused, but the material damage was slight.Eastern Mediterranean.70. Bombers operating from Egypt continued to attack shipping at-Benghazi and aerodromes in Libya. A total of 54 Wellingtons bombed Benghaziwhere fires and explosions broke out after hits were made on the moles and on apetrol dump in the harbour.  Bombs also fell on railway sidings and near a large
ship. Several aerodromes and landing grounds, including those at BercaMartuba, G-azala, Derna and Gambut, were also attacked. At Gazala andGambut bombs fell among dispersed aircraft.71. General reconnaissance sorties were flown over Cyrenaica, the frontierarea and the Eastern Mediterranean. Our fighters escorted our reconnaissance aircraft, flew offensive sweeps over the forward areas, and provided protection for our coastal shipping.72. Activity by the German Air Force during the past week was on a verysmall scale. Long-range bombers attacked Tobruk on five occasions, but the damage caused was negligible.Gibraltar.73. Several reconnaissance sorties were flown during the week, covering sea-ports and aerodromes on the east coast of Spain. Anti-submarine patrols andconvoy escorts were also flown.     *West Africa.74. Sunderlands, Hudsons and Hurricanes flew daily convoy escorts and anti-submarine patrols.Russia.British Air Operations.75. Weather conditions continued to hinder operations by our fightersoperating in Northern Russia, and only four local defence sorties were flownduring the week.Russian Air Operations.76.   There is no information of Russian air operations.German Air Operations.77. German pressure against Moscow continues to be maintained, but thefact that during the present phase of operations no air attacks of any significanceagainst the city itself have so far taken place indicates the extent to whichthe German Air Force long-range bomber effort continues to be employed againstdefence positions which have now been reached, as well as against communications.78. It seems that there has recently been some decrease in the intensivescale of operations maintained at the opening of the offensive, due to poor weather conditions and reduced serviceability, which on an average probably does not atpresent exceed 50 per cent, of the aircraft engaged.79. Operations in the southern sector have been resumed with an advance on the town of Stalin, north of the Sea of Azov. The reopening of the attack onthe Crimea from the Perekop Isthmus implies some strengthening of the forcesat the disposal of the G.A.F. in this sector.80. The Leningrad and Finnish fronts remain quiet except for one bombing attack on the aerodrome from which our fighters are operating, which causedneither damage nor casualties.HOME SECURITY SITUATION.General.81. No bombs were dropped on land in daylight. On the first three nights of the week there was no bombing, and on the remaining nights bombs were widelyscattered, the areas principally affected being Merseyside, Tees-side and Tyneside.Elsewhere there were many isolated incidents of little importance.
Damage.82. The most serious damage was done in Bootle on the 20th/21st, whereone holder of the Liverpool Gas Company was burned out and an A.R.P.transport garage extensively damaged. Otherwise, damage was mainly confined to house property at Bootle, Farnworth near Widnes, Bagillt in Flintshire, Orstonin Nottinghamshire and Dover.Casualties.83. Casualties for the week ending 0800 the 22nd October are estimated at45 killed and 62 seriously injured.[23050]
